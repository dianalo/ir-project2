Withthe President scheduled to visit Moscow in February, U.S.policy is to &quot;lock in&quot; arms-control agreements while theGorbachev era lasts.   But the Shevardnadze resignation, it seems to us, raisesan even more fundamental question: With whom are wenegotiating? With the continued disintegration of the SovietUnion, and with the collapse of President Gorbachev's defacto authority even as he demands new paper authority, whoin the Soviet Union can order the Red Army to lay down itsarms?</LP><TEXT>   Recent events give us reason to doubt, indeed, whethersigning an agreement with Mr. Gorbachev can &quot;lock in&quot; thecurrent regime, let alone all future ones. In November, heand President Bush signed a treaty paring back conventionalforces in Europe. But the ink was barely dry before theSoviets began acting like there was no treaty at all. TheSoviets declared 20,000 fewer weapons than NATO thought theyhad, and transferred others out of the area covered by thetreaty -- a clear treaty violation. By one account, theSoviets literally replaced Army uniform patches with navymarkings, since naval &quot;infantry&quot; aren't covered by thetreaty.   Even before November, one of the largest militarymovements in history had already transferred some 60,000tanks and armored pieces east of the Urals, where they alsowon't be covered by the treaty. This may be technically legalunder the treaty, but it doesn't say much for the spirit ofdisarmament. Instead of being destroyed along with NATO'sweapons, Soviet tanks will now sit just a few hundred milesfurther east.   The START nuclear-arms talks are also stymied, thoughPresident Bush insists he wants to sign the treaty on hisFebruary trip. The Soviets are balking at a U.S. request toinspect plants for the rocket motors used to launch ballisticmissiles. These plants are easier for U.S. intelligence todetect, so cheating would be more difficult. For their part,the Soviets only want to allow inspection of missile-assemblyplants, which is like inspecting a house without looking atthe furnace. What do Soviet generals have to hide?   This verification point is critical because the U.S. hasalready agreed to the Soviet request not to ban mobilemissiles. In a country (or Russian republic) spanning 11 timezones, there are plenty of places to stash warheads. Congressis in the process of killing America's mobile missiles (theMX and Midgetman), so any Soviet breakout would leave themfar ahead. Throw in concessions the U.S. has already madelimiting our best weapon, the cruise missile, and it's easyto imagine a treaty that Georgia chameleon Sam Nunn couldpick apart in the Senate.   And, amazingly, new SS-24 missiles (deployed on rail cars)and SS-25s (on trucks) continue to roll off the assemblyline. The SS-25 made its first public appearance in a Kremlinparade in November. Soviet military capabilities remainformidable, and have continued to grow despite glasnost andthe rest. In particular, the Kremlin retains the world'slargest nuclear arsenal, with warheads still aimed atWashington and Wyoming, not Baghdad. Leningrad citizens maybe clamoring for food, but the Soviet military seems to haveno problem getting what it needs. Indeed, the militaryrefuses to release or account for its own strategic foodreserves.   All of which makes us wonder, what's our rush? So far,arms control has not reduced the Soviet threat, even with Mr.Shevardnadze, Mr. Gorbachev and the rest. It is even lesslikely to restrain the Soviets if, as Mr. Shevardnadze fears,its political system evolves back to &quot;dictatorship.&quot; Indeed,agreements may even retard Soviet reform by guaranteeing theSoviet military a certain &quot;floor&quot; for its militaryproduction. It's possible Mr. Baker wants a treaty forAmerican political purposes, of course, though it might proveembarrassing to sign a treaty with a leader who turns aroundand declares martial law in the Baltics.   The Soviets are the ones who should be dying for armsagreements, not us. They have the economy that's a shambles,and the empire that's breaking at the seams. Why lock inanything now? If we've really won the Cold War, why don't wejust declare victory in arms control, too?</TEXT></DOC>
