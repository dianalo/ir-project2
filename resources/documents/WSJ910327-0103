It was your word against Mr. Guariglia's. Theconsensus among those jurors was that your testimony was&quot;vague.&quot; They did not say you lied, but perhaps you did nottell the whole truth. . . . For the greater part of ourdeliberations, you were the one on trial. . . .</LP><TEXT>   Sincerely,   Formerly Juror 8                                                                                                          Call it RICO's Revenge. Before he became thenot-very-credible witness, assistant federal prosecutorBaruch Weiss handled the racketeering case against RobertWallach. His star witness was Anthony Guariglia, the formerpresident of Wedtech who &quot;cooperated&quot; by testifying againstMr. Wallach. After Mr. Wallach was convicted, Mr. Guarigliawas tried for perjury. Last month's verdict could not havebeen worse news for the prosecutors.   The embarrassing story begins when prosecutors assuredjurors in the Wallach trial that they could believe Mr.Guariglia despite his bribery convictions because he hadagreed to pay restitution and stop gambling. This despite thediscovery by Mr. Wallach's lawyers of casino records showingthat Mr. Guariglia still gambled. Prosecutors said he mighthave bought chips, but didn't gamble; they also stayed silentwhen Mr. Guariglia swore he &quot;never laid a chip&quot; on the gamingtable.   Prosecutors managed to keep evidence of Mr. Guariglia'sperjury from the Wallach jury. Mr. Wallach was convicted andsentenced to six years in jail, while for cooperating Mr.Guariglia got five months in a halfway house. Former JudgeRobert Bork, who now represents Mr. Wallach, challengedprosecutors to indict Mr. Guariglia for lying on the stand.   Rudolph Giuliani was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan whobrought the case against Mr. Wallach. His successor, OttoObermaier, agreed to charge Mr. Guariglia. The jury agreedthat Mr. Guariglia committed perjury, but deadlocked onwhether he also lied to prosecutors about the gambling. Theimplication, suggested in Juror 8's letter to Mr. Weiss, isthat jurors thought Mr. Guariglia told prosecutors he wasstill gambling. In court papers filed this month, Mr. Borkcharges that the prosecution's use of &quot;perjured statementswas knowing.&quot; Appeals judges considering Mr. Wallach's casehave the unpleasant task of sorting out whether prosecutorscovered up their witness's perjury.   Mr. Guariglia's perjury was on what lawyers call acollateral issue, meaning his gambling was not directlyrelated to whether Mr. Wallach was guilty of anything. Butthe special characteristics of a RICO trial make theGuariglia perjury an especially formidable argument againstthe prosecution.   The claim was that bills Mr. Wallach sent to Wedtech were&quot;mail fraud&quot; because they were marked as legal bills but wereactually for promises to lobby for the defense contractor.Mr. Wallach denied the charges, prosecutors admitted he didvaluable legal work for the firm and there is no law making aprivate citizen's lobbying or promises to lobby a crime.Still, he was convicted on the perjurer Guariglia's claimthat the legal bills were for lobbying -- another lesson thatRICO means never having to prove a real crime.   During the argument for reversing the Wallach conviction,Judge Thomas Meskill said that &quot;the perjury issue could bedispositive.&quot; Perjury will also be on the judges' mindsbecause this is not the only high-profile Giulianiprosecution that raises questions about &quot;cooperating&quot;witnesses:   -- Last week, the federal appeals court reversed thestock-manipulation conviction of GAF and its James Sherwin.Judge Daniel Mahoney raised the issue of possible perjury byprosecution witness James Melton, who testified about phonecalls supposedly related to alleged manipulation. Defenselawyers discovered ATandamp;T records showing the calls were nevermade. Judge Mahoney called it &quot;disturbing&quot; that prosecutorsstill haven't investigated the possible perjury. He said,&quot;The government is inescapably obliged to investigate fullythe contradiction between Melton's testimony and the phonerecords.&quot;   -- The infamous handcuffing of investment bankers RichardWigton and Timothy Tabor was apparently based on informationMartin Siegel gave prosecutors. The insider-trading case waseventually dropped, with prosecutors blaming a&quot;misunderstanding of information provided by Siegel.&quot;Precisely what Mr. Siegel told prosecutors may never beknown. He got the sweetheart sentence of two months, despitegiving Ivan Boesky inside information for cash in suitcases.   -- Perhaps the most notorious cooperating witness was Mr.Boesky. He apparently was the main source of the originalclaims against Michael Milken, including insider trading.Even under the threat of RICO, Mr. Milken pleaded only totechnical charges. Judge Kimba Wood decided at thepre-sentencing hearing that prosecutors couldn't prove themore serious allegations. Prosecutors never let Mr. Boeskytestify against Mr. Milken; perhaps they no longer believedhim. Still, Mr. Boesky got a three-year sentence for $80million in insider-trading profits, compared with Mr.Milken's 10 years for causing losses Judge Wood estimated at$318,000.   -- Then there is the appeal by officials ofPrinceton/Newport, the securities firm Mr. Giuliani RICOedout of business. There was contradictory evidence aboutwhether allegedly fraudulent tax trades were legal tax-driventrades. Appeals judges haven't ruled yet, but again there'sevidence of the unholy alliance of perjury and RICO. JudgeEllsworth Van Graafeiland noted in the appellate argumentthat &quot;RICO has been applied in so many areas that Congressnever intended.&quot;   Mr. Obermaier defends his office's handling of the Wallachcase and more generally the reliance on plea-bargainedwitnesses. &quot;It could be the devil himself and we would strikea deal, hoping it was not Faustian,&quot; Mr. Obermaier said. Healso noted his office brought two rare perjury cases againstformer cooperating witnesses: Mr. Guariglia and a druginformant who lied about his income taxes.   Mr. Obermaier sees a big difference between manywhite-collar prosecutions and the drug or violent-crime casesthat prosecutors more typically handle. &quot;In many other cases,there is a self-authenticating mechanism,&quot; he said. &quot;Eitherwe find drugs where the witness says or we don't. This kindof evidence is not always available in white-collar cases.&quot;This should be a reason for added skepticism aboutcooperating witnesses in cases that come down to one person'sword against another's.   It's worth noting that federal appeals judges are not theonly line of defense against plea bargains that lead toperjury. The Justice Department is also supposed to supervisethe U.S. attorneys. There is more than enough evidence forAttorney General Dick Thornburgh to open an investigationinto some of Mr. Giuliani's more infamous prosecutions. Asfor Mr. Obermaier, he confirms that in nearly 18 months onthe job he has not brought any white-collar criminal RICOcases.</TEXT></DOC>
