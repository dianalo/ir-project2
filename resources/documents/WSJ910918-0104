Top officials at several companies sold million-dollarblocks of stock in August at prices well above what they hadpaid for the stock, recent insider filings with the SEC show.</LP><TEXT>   The shares were acquired at below-market prices throughthe exercise of company-granted options. And, thanks to achange in SEC rules, the insiders were able to sell the stockin the open market as soon as they chose. Before the rulechange took effect last May, insiders were required to holdshares acquired through the exercise of options for at leastsix months.   &quot;Executives love this,&quot; said Peter Romeo, a Washington,D.C., attorney specializing in the insider-tradingregulations. &quot;Executives can exercise options and sell sharesimmediately. There's no market risk.&quot;   There was an initial burst of option-related selling afterthe rule change, but lately there has been a sort of secondwave. Insiders who had been &quot;holding back&quot; because ofuncertainty about the rule change are now moving to takeadvantage of it, Mr. Romeo said. &quot;You're seeing tons ofthis.&quot;   The SEC still requires a six-month holding period forstock purchased through options. But the clock starts the daythe options are granted, not exercised. That makes optionholdings &quot;more liquid and less expensive,&quot; said DavidColeman, the editor of Vickers Weekly Insider Report, anewsletter published in Huntington, N.Y.   Before, executives &quot;had to put out the money for sixmonths&quot; before they could sell the shares and recoup theirinvestment, Mr. Coleman said. But not anymore.   Companies at which option-related sales by chairmen orpresidents exceeded $5 million in August include PhilipMorris Cos., U.S. Surgical Corp. and Zeos International Ltd.   The chairman of Philip Morris, Hamish Maxwell, sold117,000 shares for $70.80 each, or a total of $8.3 million,on Aug. 6, according to SEC filings. He acquired them earlythis year, through options exercises, at $18.44 a share, thefilings show. The shares sold represented 14% of Mr.Maxwell's stockholdings in the company, according to SECfilings. He couldn't be reached for comment. However, thecompany said he holds options to purchase another 856,000shares.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, shares ofthe New York concern were trading late yesterday at $72.875,up 12.5 cents.   At U.S. Surgical, a Norwalk, Conn.based medical suppliescompany, Chairman Leon C. Hirsch sold 193,795 shares, SECfilings show. Most of those shares were obtained throughstock-option exercises earlier this year at $12.25 a share,the filings show. He sold the shares at prices ranging fromabout $72 to $75, according to SEC filings.   Mr. Hirsch wasn't available for comment, but the companysaid his current holdings, including options to purchaseshares, total more than 5.7 million shares. &quot;Mr. Hirsch feelsany insider of the company should have the opportunity totake profits in their shares to improve their lifestyle,&quot; aspokeswoman said.
