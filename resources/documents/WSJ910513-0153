Although formally without office, the former Sovietforeign minister has met with top administration officials(including his close friend Secretary of State James Baker)and congressional leaders, as well as giving advice to newgraduates at Boston University.   Yet despite Mr. Shevardnadze's claim to be one of theleaders of the democratic movement in the Soviet Union, thereis a very nasty dark side to his own career. He was, afterall, minister of the Department of the Interior from 1965 to1972, and thereafter first secretary of the Central Committeeof the Communist Party of Georgia. In both capacities, he wasin charge of &quot;anti-corruption campaigns,&quot; which, as studentsof Soviet politics know, were purges by another name.</LP><TEXT>   It is not easy to get details of Mr. Shevardnadze'sefforts in Georgia, but some &quot;samizdat&quot; publications of theperiod, as well as several books by Soviet and Georgiandissidents, contain considerable information. A particularlydetailed account consists of the signed confession of oneYuri Tsirekidze, convicted in April 1975 of &quot;extensive bodilyinjury leading to fatal consequences&quot; (that is, beating a manto death) and &quot;refusing help to a suffering person.&quot; Hecommitted these crimes in the Investigatory Detention Centerin Tbilisi, where Mr. Shevardnadze was in charge.   Mr. Tsirekidze's actions were part of a vast purge carriedout under the supervision of Mr. Shevardnadze: In the twoyears preceding Mr. Tsirekidze's trial, some 25,000 personswere arrested in Georgia, of whom 9,500 were party membersand another 7,000 of whom came from the Komsomol, the partyyouth organization. Here are some excerpts of the confession:   &quot;On orders of the procurator Lezhava and his brother . . .and on assignment from E. Shevardnadze, I was told, theobject Roman Enukidze was sent to me. He was in a group . . .of the Bureau of Land for Gardening . . . Lezhava,Svimonishvili and others promised me that if I handled thiscase they would free me, since Shevardnadze himself had givenhis word.   &quot;I processed the Object Enukidze. I put all my energy intoit. He had been under observation before. I put him in touchwith his home and convinced him of everything. I made himconfess . . . to the Minister of Internal Affairs of theGeorgian SSR.&quot;   The methods used to extract confessions from theseunfortunate &quot;objects&quot; were the same as usual in Georgia:   &quot;In room 45 Agdgomelashvili (an agent) beat Mikhelashvili(a Jew) on assignment from Panfilov (chief of operations), inroom 44 agents . . . beat and cut with a razor the objectDatusani, in room 37 agent Usupyan on assignment fromPanfilov and Svimonishvili beat the object ValeriKukhianidze, whose internal organs got so beat up he spitblood, after which he died in the Central Prison Hospital andwas `written off.'&quot;   &quot;. . . In a word, beating went on in all the rooms, andthe groaning and howling of the objects was heard all overthe building . . . . {I}t was a slaughterhouse.&quot;   The author of these damning statements -- the unfortunateMr. Tsirekidzewas the fall guy for the KGB and Interiorministry officials who ordered him to carry out his acts ofbrutality. And one of those officials, the one who had &quot;givenhis word&quot; that Mr. Tsirekidze would go free if he werevicious enough in interrogation, eventually made it all theway up the ladder to become foreign minister of the SovietUnion.   Similar stories, documenting both the generalShevardnadze-led repression and the extensive use of tortureunder his leadership can be found in Zviad Gamsakhurdia'sRussian-language book on &quot;Torture in Georgia&quot; (1976), in N.Gougouchvili's &quot;La Georgie&quot; (1983) and in Ludmila Alexeeva's&quot;History of Dissent in the U.S.S.R.,&quot; published in Russian bythe Khronika Press in Vermont in 1984.   Mr. Shevardndze's actions in those years should come as nogreat surprise, given the nature of Soviet politics, and itis even possible that, having reached the heights, and havingseen the wretched state into which the Soviet Union hadfallen, Mr. Shevardnadze underwent a fundamental conversionto the values of peace, democracy and the rule of law. But itbehooves us to tell the full story of this powerful andambitious man, who has certainly made a contribuion to worldpeace, but who also bears responsibility for dreadful acts ofbrutality on a vast scale.   ---   Mr. Ledeen is resident scholar at the American EnterpriseInstitute.</TEXT></DOC>
