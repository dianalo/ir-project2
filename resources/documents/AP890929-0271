On other commodity markets, corn and soybean futures retreated,livestock and meat futures were mixed, energy futures were mostlyhigher and precious metals declined.   Wheat futures settled 2\ cents to 7} cents higher with thecontract for delivery in December at $4.07\ a bushel, the highestsettlement for a near-month wheat contract since June 30.   Corn was 1\ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with December at$2.33 a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2 cents lower with Decemberat $1.44 a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 4 cents lower withNovember at $5.68 a bushel.   In a report released after the close of trading Thursday, theUSDA projected wheat stocks for June 1, 1990 at 1.91 billionbushels compared to trade estimates averaging 1.99 billion.   Corn stocks as of Sept. 1 were estimated at 1.93 billion bushelscompared to trade estimates averaging 1.89 billion, and the USDAestimated soybean stocks as of Sept. 1 at 182 million bushels,compared to trade estimates averaging 159 million.   The USDA report provided the main support for the wheat marketbut traders said a surge in in export sales of U.S. grains duringthe week also helped boost wheat futures and limited losses in thecorn and soybean markets.   ``All things considered, I think the market acted real good,''said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.   The USDA announced after the close that it had accepted bidsfrom exporters to cover the sale of 270,000 metric tons of wheat toChina at subsidized prices, and market analysts said Egypt wasseeking to buy 500,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat.   The USDA also announced that 150,000 metric tons of corn hadbeen sold to unknown destinations, which is often interpreted as asale to the Soviet Union.   Rumors that the Soviets were seeking to buy U.S. corn had givencorn futures a lift on Thursday.   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange ahead of the USDA's quarterly hogs-and-pigsreport, which estimated the U.S. swine herd as of Sept. 1 at 58.4million head, about the same as last year and very close to marketexpectations.   But analysts said near-term hog futures may open lower Monday inreaction to another section of the report that showed porkproducers had kept slightly more hogs for marketing than tradershad expected.   The hog report was perceived as slightly bullish for thedeferred contracts, though, because it indicated pork producers hadbacked off a bit on their fall breeding intentions, which wouldimply a smaller supply of hogs next spring and summer.   ``For the short term, the report was a little tinge negative,for the long term, bullish,'' said Chuck Levitt, senior livestockanalyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.   Live cattle settled .45 cent lower to .03 cent higher with thecontract for delivery in October at 71.92 cents a pound; feedercattle were .40 cent lower to .15 cent higher with October at 82.95cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent lower to .38 cent higher withOctober at 43.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .28 centto .68 cent lower with February at 48.22 cents a pound.   Most energy futures prices rose on the New York MercantileExchange as traders were encouraged by OPEC's ability to reach anagreement to limit production.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 15 cents lower to 27cents higher with November at $20.13 a barrel; heating oil was .43cent to .77 cent higher with October at 59.44 cents a gallon;unleaded gasoline was .53 cent lower to .65 cent higher withOctober at 60.40 cents a gallon.   Gold and silver futures fell moderately on New York's CommodityExchange, despite a drop in the dollar, amid pre-weekendprofit-taking.   Gold futures ended 30 cents to 90 cents lower with October at$367.20 a troy ounce; silver was 3.7 cents to 4 cents lower withOctober at $5.226 a troy ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
