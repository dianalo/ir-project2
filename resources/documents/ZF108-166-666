(guide to CD-ROM publications) (buyers guide)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Onosko, Timothy.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>A guide to CD-ROM products available for the Apple Macintosh ispresented.andP;  Many of the discs offer clip art and large typefacelibraries.andP;  Some, such as Wayzata Technologies' Seals in theGovernment Printing Office collection of scanned US governmentimages, are highly specialized.andP;  Prices range from $99 to $999.andO;Several user groups offer collections of public-domain andshareware programs archived on CD-ROM.andP;  CD-ROM reference booksrange from The Electronic Whole Earth Catalog to Webster's NinthNew Collegiate DIctionary.andP;  Entertainment software on CD-ROM isalso discussed.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     CD-ROMSoftware SelectionDirectoriesClip ArtComputer GamesIntegrated SoftwareData bases.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Graphically SpeakingandM;Because graphics require so much memory, using CD-ROM discs is an excellentway to package them.andP;  Many of the following titles including typefaces, clipart, and photographs - are examples of the way CD-ROM is being used in thepublishing business.andM;Art Room is a compilation of Image Club's entire library of PostScriptdisplay typefaces and a huge collection of EPSF clip art (more than 2,800images).andP;  Well organized, it includes 50 templates for page-layout programs,Font Juggler DA (instead of the Font/DA Mover), and the Art Room Retriever DAfor searching through the disc by keyword as well as for previewing art.andM;Image Club's fonts include some clever new designs - about 100 faces andvariations in all - and several folders of color graphics, all of which arecompatible with major page-layout programs.andP;  Pros: One of the most attractiveand versatile graphic-arts Cds.andP;  More than 1,500 pages of art make itsufficient for many desktop-publishing jobs.andP;  Some of hte best typefaces areavailable as Adobe Illustrator files, so characters can be colored,stretched, etc.andM;Cons: Search and Preview feature is fairly slow and clumsy to workwith.andP;  Someclip-art pieces are pretty large and require a 2-megabyte machine in order todo any manipulation beyond simple placement in a la out.andM;Image Club's Darkroom offers 375 digitized gray-scale photographs that can bemanipulated and pasted into desktop publications via any standard page-layoutprogram that accepts TIFF files.andP;  If you want to do any serious retouching ormanipulating, however, you'll need a program such as Image Studio.andM;The collection, from Toronto's Focus Stock, includes photos of people,business activities scientific and medical images scenic settings, and more.andO;Images are generic - smiling families, silhouettes at sunset, and the like.andO;Pros: Provides variety of professionally done images for newsletters andother layouts.andP;  Ph be used for any purpose, with proper credit.andP;  Color slidesand a color catalog are available.andM;Cons: Files, digitized with a Barneyscan 35mm slide scanner, appear lessdistinct and have lower contrast than photos in the Comstock collection (seefollowing review).andP;  Most shots are too large to be opened in Image Studio ona 1-megabyte machine.andM;Comstock's Desktop Photography contains 464 digitized gray-scale photographssuitable for use in desktop publications.andP;  Pagemaker (or any other programthat accepts TIFF) is fine for cropping, sizing, and setting halftone scales,but you need a more powerful application for serious manipulations.andP;  Thephotos are comparable to Darkroom's in both quality and subject matter.andM;Pros: Varied collection useful for many purposes.andP;  Images sharper thanDarkroom images.andP;  includes color catalog; color slides available for anadditional fee.andP;  Comstock grants use rights for in-house publications such ascompany newsletters and comps.andP;  Con: Advertising use requires a separatelicense.andM;Exotica ROM is a collection of 107 female pin-ups by Olivia De Berardinis,who seunusual nudes have a cult following.andP;  Each illustration is furnished infour different formats: scanned gray scale, color, black-and-white TIFF, andMacPaint-compatible.andP;  There are a few public domain graphics applicationshere too.andM;Pros: Hypercard stack makes browsing easy; &quot;slideshow&quot; application runs on aMacintosh II with color monitor.andM;Cons: Few desktop publications could use this art; use rights are unclear.andM;Letterpress offers fonts through Image Club's The Desktop Vending Machine.andO;It works like this: Image Club furnishes a disc with several typefaces,chiefly of its own design, that are unlocked.andP;  Other typefaces and clip-artfiles on the disc are locked.andP;  You unlock the files by calling the companyfor the password - at $99 per volume of clip art and $25 per weight forfamilies of fonts.andM;Pro: This method of selling software is a terrific way for adesktoppublishing company or a typesetting service bureau to get goingquickly, with relatively little expense.andP;  Con: Typefaces in the reviewedversion were Type 3 Postscript faces, which do not reproduce at small sizesas well as Adobe's encrypted Type 1 faces do.andM;Image ClubandM;1802 11th St., Suite 5andM;S.E.andP;  Calgary, Aberta TSG 3G2andM;CanadaandM;(403) 262-8008andM;Completely unlocked versions, $4,999; &quot;limited-occess version,  $199andM;NEC Desktop Publishing SystemandM;As a set, these four discs are a complete desktop-publishing resource for acorporate publishing center or an independent studio.andM;NEC, Inc.andM;1255 Michael DriveandM;Woodale, IL 60191andM;(312) 860-9500andM;Clip Art 3-6andM;NEC takes clip art to a new dimension with Clip Art 3-D.andP;  The solid modeldigital images can be sized, rotated, edited, and relit at will.andM;The models -airplanes, architectural models, everyday objects, and 3-D fonts- can be saved in PICT, TIFF, and EPSF.andP;  Most come in full color.andM;Pro: A good library of objects.andM;Cons: Models can't be considered realistic, as no smoothing technique areapplied.andP;  Complexity of models slows operations d machine.andP;  $389andM;Image Gallery is a thoughtfully assembled clip-art library from MetroImageBase.andP;  The Gallery is a mixture of black-and-white EPSF files of lineart and 300-dpi TIFF files.andP;  The art, divided into 20 categories, representsstyles of many eras and artists.andP;  Some of the images, however, are downrightordinary - the kind you find in every suburban shopper's guide.andM;Pro: With almost 3,000 images, should fit almost all graphics needs.andM;Con: Some art is mundane and typical of conventional clip-art sources.andM;399andM;Photo Gallery is a collection of 1,501 gray-scale shots supplied as TIFFfiles from Uniphoto, a commercial supplier of stock photos.andP;  Photographs canbe used without charge in newsletters, in-house company reports, mock-ups,and composites.andP;  Pros: The selection is more complete and diverse than usual.andO;Photos are not overly light or dark, so laser printers can be used with goodresults.andP;  Cons: High license fee for magazine or newspaper use.andP;  Shots comein uniform size, a problem if large, full- page sizes are required.andM;At the heart of the NEC system is type Gallery PS, which is practically theentire Adobe Postscript type library.andP;  Only one face (Kaufmann Script) seemsto be missing.andP;  Type Gallery uses a pay-per-file unlocking scheme similar tothat of Letterpress.andP;  The cost of unlocking these files ranges from $49 to$259, depending on the number of type styles with in the type family.andP;  Youcan get the disc with all 470-plus typefaces unlocked, but that is a costlyproposition.andP;  Pros: Faces in Type Gallery PS are complete Adobe Type 1(encrypted) fonts.andP;  Look spectacularly good in any printed size.andP;  Truly aprecious resource.andP;  Con: With the future of Postscript somewhat uncertain, asizable investment in the entire type library is wise only for thosecommitted to the Postscript standard.andM;ProArt Trilogy 1 has over 350 Adobe illustrator files (EPSF) of business,holiday, and sports art.andP;  Pro: The Postscript art prints well.andP;  Con:Collection is limited to very few topics.andM;Multi-Ad Services, Inc. 1720 W. Detweiller Drive Peoria, IL 61615 (309)682-1530 $375andM;The &quot;big daddy&quot; of the pack is Wayzata Technology's Quickart, which islicensed f rom Wheeler Art, a vendor of traditional newspaper and ad clipart.andP;  The material ranges from toys and religious images to music, food, andcartoons.andM;Pros: Only Image Club's artroom has more files than Quickart.andP;  Disc can beconveniently browsed via a Hypercard stack.andP;  Lets you view Tiff images beforeimporting them into a DTP program.andP;  Con: Similar in quality to the clip artfrom any other publisher.andM;Wayzata Technology, Inc. P.O. Box 225 Farmington, MN 55024 (800) 735-7321(612) 460-8438 $249andM;This unique clip-art disc contains more than 600 scanned images of officialU.S.andP;  government seals, provided as 300-dpi TIFF files.andP;  The disc haseverything from the Department of Agriculture's meat-grading stamp designs tothe Postal Service's Mr. Zip.andP;  There's a Hypercard stack for browsing and aRetouch function for manipulating and even altering official symbols.andM;Pros: Comes with same TIFF viewing software as Quick Art.andP;  Nifty collectionthat provides an endless resource for practical jokers.andM;Con: Most people would have no use for such a specialized discandM;Wayzata Technology, Inc.andM;P.O.andP;  Box 225andM;Farmington, MN 55024andM;(800) 735-7321andM;(612) 460-MandM;$69.95andM;Public DomainandM;CD-ROM offers a way to conveniently archive public-domain programs frombulletin-board systems and user groups.andM;The title of the Boston Computer Society's public-domain disc may be short,but the disc is long on excellence.andP;  The PD Navigator Hypercard stack, forinstance, contains minireviews of the 1,700-plus programs in the BCS'Spublic-domain library.andM;The disc contains such offerings as software written for and by health-careprofessionals; a Technical Library folder of tech information andprogrammers' aids; and Bonus, a grab bag of programs not otherwisedistributed by the BCS.andM;Pro: Well-assembled disc contains more than the usual batch of public domainprograms.andM;Cons: Difficult to search and needs a more complete directory.andM;Boston Computer SocietyandM;Macintosh Users GroupandM;48 Grove St.andM;Somervile, MA 02144andM;(617) 625-7080andM;$125andM;This electronic  magazine,&quot; the only one available by subscription, isprobably the best organized of the public-domain CDs, as it is arranged likea BBS.andP;  It has excellent searching and browsing features via HyperCard, andclear instructions on creating floppy disk sets.andM;The disc has articles, classified ads, and an extensive list of U.S.andP;  andinternational Mac user groups, as well as a huge number of programs,including 596 DAs, 145 desktop-publishing files and templates, 818 HyperCardstacks, 1,470 graphics files, 385 game and leisure applications, and 731music files.andM;Pro: Large, well-organized inventory of data and programs.andM;Con: Some of the large directories open slowly and tax the limits of theFinder.andM;Quantum Access, Inc.andM;1700 West Loop S., Suite 1480andM;Houston,  TX 77027andM;(713) 622-3211andM;Single issue, $199; one-year subscription, $350andM;MegaROM 2.0andM;MegaROM, an early public-domain collection, contains enough files to makeeven the most cursory look an exhausting one.andP;  Pro: Superb source of largefiles too costly to download from an on-line system.andP;  Con: The disc's onlydirectory is a giant (240K) Microsoft Word file, making location of desireditems difficult.andM;Quantum Leap Technologies, Inc.andM;314 Romno Ave.andM;Coral Gables, FL 33134andM;(800) 762-2877 (orders only)andM;(305) 448-2477andM;$49andM;PD-ROM 1.1andM;BMUG (the Berkeley, California, Mac user group), which is one of the oldestuser groups in the nation, offers a widely varied collection of material thatis a genuine group effort.andP;  You sense the organization behind this product,from the comments in the Hypercard &quot;navigation&quot; stack to the contributions tothe group's widely read newsletter.andM;PD-ROM has games, Hypercard stacks, graphics, DAs, fonts, sounds, utilities,a complete set of BMUG newsletters, and more than 17 megabytes of messagesfrom on-line services such as Delphi.andM;Version 2.0, containing 15,000 files (more than double the size of 1.1),should be out in January 1990.andP;  It will have a better user interface, will beindexed, and will take advantage of Discovery's search engine.andP;  Pro: A goodvalue, with logically organized material.andP;  Cons: Some folders, mainlygraphics and pictures, cannot open from the desktop except through Hypercard.andO;MacWrite doesn't always work reliably from the CD.andM;Discovery SystemsandM;7001 Discovery Blvd.andM;Dublin, OH 43017andM;(814) 761-2000andM;$100; 2.0 upgrade,  $50andM;The Right StuffedandM;Quantum's The Right Stuffed crams extra data onto a CD-ROM disc because thefiles are  stuffed,&quot; or compressed, before mastering.andP;  The disc contains morethan 80 megabytes of art files, 78 megs of sounds, 61 megs of demos, 44 megsof games, and more.andP;  Files are decompressed with Stufflt shareware, includedon the disc.andP;  Pros: Contains an impressive 600-plus megabytes of data,including entire collection of Adobe screen fonts and entire 90-disk libraryfrom the National Apple User Group Conference of 1989.andP;  Files are publicdomain except for the Adobe fonts and some demos.andP;  File format is compatiblewith bulletin-board systems' software programs.andM;Con: Disc lacks a convenient directory system, and &quot;unstuffing&quot; process ofthe files makes browsing more time-consuming.andM;Quantum Leap Technologies, Inc.andM;314 Romano Ave.andM;Coral Gables, FL 33134andM;(800) 792-2877 (orders only)andM;(305) 448-2477andM;$99andM;ReferentialandM;TreatmentandM;Reference books contain an enormous amount of material, but they also take upa lot of space.andP;  CD-ROM discs are ideal for mass storage of encyclopedias,telephone directories, fact books, and even catalogs.andM;This one's a clunker.andP;  Its title is most promising a virtual cartographicdepartment on a desktop.andP;  But promise and delivery are two different things.andM;The purpose of the disc is to create maps from a database of nearly everymetropolitan area in the U.S.andP;  If you live in a town of any appreciable size,chances are your street is on this disc.andM;Pro: Hefty, admirable job of data entry.andM;Cons: No labels on any maps.andP;  Can find street names by clicking on a road orhighway, but process takes too long.andP;  Street labels don't tell anything else,such as the name of the next street over.andP;  Until these problems arerectified, stick with the paper variety.andM;Highlighted Data, Inc.andM;P.D.andP;  Box 17220andM;Washington dulles International AirportandM;Washington, DC 20041andM;(703) 241-1180andM;$199.95andM;Of all the currently available CD-ROM discs, The Electronic Whole EarthCatalog comes closest to demonstrating a real vision of what the medium hasgoing for it.andP;  This massive HyperCard stack (more than 9,000 cards) includesa broad range of subjects community, household, media, health, music, andmore.andP;  The catalog makes good use of Hypercard's ability to link cards byrelated ideas for easier and more fruitful browsing.andM;For those who are unfamiliar with creator Stewart Brand's concept, the WholeEarth Catalog is a catchall for practical information about tools,technology, and toys, as well as some trendy Northern California fluff.andP;  Itremains to be seen if it stays current through frequent revisions or whetherthis is just a great demo disc.andM;Pros: Thorough, well organized, and well executed.andP;  Extremely browsable,unlike most big-data CDs.andM;Con: Slower than most because of multiple stacks and digitized audio.andM;Broderbund SoftwareandM;17 Paul DriveandM;San Rafael, CA 94903-2101andM;(415) 482-8200andM;$149.95andM;Facts on File ews DigestandM;Facts on File News Digest contains much more useful information than theElectronic Whole Earth Catalog, but it isn't nearly as creative in itsapproach.andP;  The information - Facts on File's newspaper- and magazine-articleabstracts from the 1980s - is organized in three levels: You can search bykeyword, browse through a person-and-topic list, or view maps.andM;Pro: Information is extremely valuable, although it covers only 1980 through1988.andM;Cons: No hypertext feature, and index is hard to browse.andP;  The applicationused to access data on the disc, which resides on a hard disk or the suppliedfloppy, is skittish about running under Multifander.andP;  Conventional Finder ona Mac IIcx with lots of memory and System 6.03 ran fine; keyword searchbombed a lot.andP;  Application didn't like a large video display and couldn't beresized.andP;  Information can be printed but not copied and pasted to otherdocuments.andM;Facts on FileandM;480 Park Ave. S.andM;New York, NY 10016andM;(212) 888-2244andM;$770andM;Here's one of those technological dreams: A massive phone book on yourpersonal computer.andP;  The National Directory is a kind of U.S.andP;  Yellow Pages of115,000 organizations, including toll free and fax numbers, and addresses.andO;You can do a search of the directory based on any element of a company's nameor address and then create customized mailing lists and fax-modem directoriesbased on your search criteria.andP;  By the way, area/national directory would begreat.andP;  Theoretically, a CD-ROM disc could contain tens of millions of names,addresses, and phone numbers.andM;Pros: Obvious value of a national phone book; automated search capabilitygives the CD-ROM disc a great advantage over a printed book.andP;  Fax directoryis especially appealing.andM;Cons: Still faster to look up numbers in a book.andP;  Tedious to move f rom cardto card within the database; no cross-referencing (except via searches bycategory, name, town, and so on).andP;  Lets you create mailing lists but notenter additional data.andM;XiphiasandM;8758 Venice Blvd.andM;Los Angeles, CA 00084andM;(213) 841-2790andM;$195andM;The New Electronic EncyclopediaandM;This disc is not an ambitious project.andP;  It includes only the text and none ofthe illustrations of its paper counterpart, the Academic AmericanEncyclopedia.andP;  Though the print version has a poor reputation, the discversion is useful for research that doesn't require in-depth analysis.andP;  Pros:Useful, competitively priced product.andP;  Any word in encyclopedia can besearched.andP;  Searches are lightning-fast, since only index and not entirevolume is searched.andP;  Runs under Multifinder, so it's unnecessary to quit froman application to do research.andM;Cons: Only first 50 articles (listed in order of number of mentions) can beaccessed.andP;  Hypertext feature moves to a reference in another article.andO;Illustrations would add to its usefulness.andM;Groiler Electronic Publishing, Inc.andM;Old Sherman TurnpikeandM;Danbury, CT  06816andM;(208) M-3500andM;$399andM;Timetable of History: Science and InnovationandM;The developers of the Timetable of History have undertaken a huge task:cataloging and organizing the history of science and technology.andO;Unfortunately, this disc promises more than it delivers.andM;The Timetable is a Hypercard system.andP;  Beginning 46 million years ago with thebig bang, it extends all the way to 1988 and covers significant events inthought, religion, science and technology, government, the arts, and everydaylife.andP;  All this information is conveyed in a 25-wordsor-less shorthand text,which leaves quite a few gaps.andP;  For instance, a search for the word fork tofind when that implement appeared as an eating tool yielded just tworeferences to tuning forks.andP;  Pros: An ambitious, encyclopedic disc.andP;  Thegraphic time-lines illustrate mostimportant events through 1988.andP;  Events arelinked to maps showing where they took place.andM;Cons: Confusing layout.andP;  Many buttons, some nonfunctional, few labeled.andO;Powerful search function allows Boolean (and/or) searches, but meagerdocumentation doesn't explain its use.andP;  in review version (the first CDROMrelease), the Go To feature for directly accessing cards didn't work, leadingto an endless loop requiring restarting.andP;  Both this disc and The NationalDirectory (also from Xiphias) appear to have been rushed to market beforebeing adequately tested.andM;XiphiasandM;8758 Venice Blvd.andM;Los Angeles, CA 90034andM;(213) 841-2700andM;$185andM;This is a potentially great idea that's not quite there yet: Webster's Ninthon a CD-ROM disc.andP;  Unlike word processors' spelling checkers, this disccontains everything the printed volume does, including pronunciations(digitally recorded), primary definitions and alternatives, illustrations,geographic place names, and a proper-name index.andP;  A large-type optionincreases the screen font to about 24 points.andM;What this product really needs is hypertext like features such as those ofMicrolytics' Wordfinder Thesaurus DA.andP;  it would be better it it could runinside other word processors, replacing their limited dictionaries andspelling checkers.andP;  Pros: Most complete dictionary for the Mac, and only onewith pronunciation feature.andP;  Definitions and illustrations can be copied andpasted into other documents.andP;  Documentation slim but good.andP;  Shows enormouspromise.andM;Cons: Version submitted for review required much more than the 770Krecommended for use with Multifinder; application used to access data on discsometimes quit unexpectedly.andP;  Searches were somewhat slow; word-lists windowhad a notepad like &quot;turned corner&quot; instead of scroll bar.andP;  illustrationscould not be copied and pasted into other documents.andM;Highlighted Data, Inc.andM;P.O.andP;

 Quick Search function is a meagersolution to the problem of browsing through data.andP;  Viewable entries arelimited to 50.andP;  Quick Search needs many, many more features.andP;  Informationcannot be copied and pasted into other documents.andM;Wayzata Technology Inc.andM;P.O.andP;

 Two megabytes of memory are recommended, butyou can get it to work by stripping a Macintosh Plus of memory-hogging INITS,DAs, and the like.andP;  Pro: Easy access to an enormous quantity of sounds thatwould be almost unmanageable on floppy disk.andP;  Cons: Browsing the stack can befrustrating; can be searched only by title, keyword, or category (thedocumentation does list all the major category headings and classifications).andO;Commercial, public domain, and shareware use rights unclear.andM;Optical Media InternationalandM;485 Alberto WayandM;Los Gatos, CA 95032andM;(408) 395-4332andM;$120andM;MacroMind CD-ROMandM;This is less a product than a great way to survey some of the best animationcreated with MacroMind's Videoworks 2, a simplified 2-D MacPaint-likeanimation program.andM;Included on the disc are MacPaint files of clip art and examples of &quot;guidedtours&quot;
