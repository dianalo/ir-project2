The expert system application was computerdiagnostics performed within a multinational computer manufacturer. Aframework for a systematic research program for evaluating the effectivenessof intelligent interfaces was developed. The framework identified theinteraction between user expertise (expert vs. novice), level of problemuncertainty, knowledge presentation format (procedural vs. declarative),question type (requiring abstract vs. concrete information organization),and decision-making process as they impact decision-making performancewhile using an expert system. A significant difference in performancewas found between high- and low-skill users. High-skill users performedfaster, more accurate, and had self-reported confidence ratings thatwere higher than low-skill users. Also, for both problem tasks, problemsolution time decreased a greater amount for low skill users than forhigh skill users when using the expert system. Finally, a negative correlationwas found between user confidence ratings and problem-solving performance.</TEXT></DOC>
