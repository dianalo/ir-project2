It is a wasted opportunity.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Bushnell thinks the way to both educate and entertainchildren is to be found in the blending of the &quot;fun&quot; aspectsof television and the computer's capacity to store vastamounts of data and &quot;interactively&quot; manipulate it in waystailored to an individual. &quot;We have the ability to put somuch content in games now that they can be educational,&quot; hesaid.   Last year, Mr. Bushnell joined Commodore InternationalLtd., a troubled Chester, Pa., computer maker, with the ideaof doing just that. At the show, Commodore displayed thefirst fruits of this effort: a novel &quot;CDTV&quot; player, priced at$999, which in some ways represents the boldest attempt yetby any computer maker to create a new category in the elusivefield of consumer electronics.   Other companies, including Apple Computer Inc., TandyCorp. and International Business Machines Co., also aretrying to blend the best aspects of television and computingin &quot;multimedia&quot; machines. However, Commodore's offering issmaller (only the size of a standard CD player), much lessexpensive and seemingly easier to use than rival products.CDTV also is squarely aimed at the home. It contains both anAmiga computer and a device that can play compact audio disksor display on a TV screen the images and data stored on a CD.The unit is controlled, not by a keyboard, but by a remote,hand-held device that works like a TV channel changer.   Though he concedes that Commodore has failed to exploitinnovations in the past, Mr. Bushnell is optimistic aboutCDTV, suggesting that this new type of player may win assecure a place in the household as the videocasette recorder.The key variable could well be software, he said. Initially,Commodore has lined up some 30 software titles for themachine, ranging in price from $30 to $100. These includeversions of popular reference works such as The Guiness Bookof Records as well as educational games from the softwarearms of Disney and LucasFilm.   In other news at the Consumer Electronics Show:   -- Nintendo of America Inc. said it scratched its majorrestriction on third-party developers creating software forits video-game players. In the past, Nintendo, which is aunit of Nintendo Co. of Japan, held exclusive rights to anygame software written for its players for at least two years.The rule effectively prevented companies from offeringversions of Nintendo's most popular games for game machinesmade by Nintendo's rivals.   The policy rankled many software developers and drew thescrutiny of the Federal Trade Commission, which last yearmounted an investigation of Nintendo's restrictive businesspractices. &quot;It was very frustrating,&quot; said Sam Tramiel, chiefexecutive officer of Atari Computer Corp., Sunnyvale, Calif.,which sells a hand-held game unit called Lynx that competeswith a Nintendo product called Game Boy. &quot;We tried to get thegood titles, but couldn't {because of the restriction}. Wejust kept banging our head against the wall and got nowhere.&quot;   The new policy opens the way for developers of popularNintendo games to create modified versions for players madeby Atari, Sega of America Inc. and others. However, observersdon't expect a rush in this direction. Nintendo's softwaredevelopers still must obtain permission from Nintendo everytime they release a game, and some say it isn't likely theywill spread their best titles around. &quot;Just because Nintendosays its OK doesn't mean they're going to be happy if we puta title on Sega,&quot; said one Nintendo software developer.   Nintendo said it made the change because its game machinesare now so popular, both here and in Japan, that the companyno longer needs such a restriction to protect its softwarebase. The company denied that it dropped the restriction tosatsify federal investigators. &quot;We didn't make this changebecause {anyone} asked us to do anything,&quot; said Howard C.Lincoln, senior vice president of Nintendo's U.S. arm.   -- Philips N.V. and Tandy gave a mouthwateringdemonstration of their digital-compact-casette (DCC)technology, which promises to give to tape the sound qualitydelivered by compact disk. Observers say the demonstrationmarks the start of a standards battle between DCC and a rivalapproach called digital-audio-tape (DAT) sponsored by SonyCorp. Proponents of DCC note that it alone allows consumersto use both their old analog and new digital tapes on asingle player-recorder. Yet DAT machines already are on themarket. John Roach, Tandy's chief executive, said DCCmachines won't be on the market before 1992.</TEXT></DOC>
