Stationary andmobile sources emit nitrogen oxides, which react in the atmosphere to formnitrogen dioxide. Nitrogen dioxide is the pollutant for which nationalambient air quality standards (NAAQS) have been established. The proposedregulations would establish air quality increments to restrict the maximumallowable increase in annual average ambient concentrations of nitrogendioxide over a baseline level in designated attainment and unclassifiableareas. The proposed regulations would also adopt a three-tiered area classificationscheme for the purpose of applying different increment requirements. To implement the proposed increment regulations for nitrogen dioxide, EPAis proposing revisions to 40 CFR Parts 51 and 52. Part 51 establishes requirementsfor the preparation, adoption, and submittal of State implementation plans(SIP's); Part 52 sets forth the Administrator's approval and promulgationof implementation plans, and establishes the regulation that is in effectin the absence of an approved SIP or until the responsibility for the programis delegated to the State.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments on the proposed regulations must be received onor before April 8, 1988; a public hearing will be held on March 23, 1988,beginning at 9:00 a.m.; requests to present oral testimony must be receivedon or before March 16, 1988.

PSD ProgramThe PSD program enacted by Congress in the 1977 Amendments to the Act containsmeasures to prevent significant deterioration in air quality, includingrequirements that major sources of air pollution employ the best availablecontrol technology (BACT) and prevent adverse impacts on Class I Federalareas. The PSD program is also implemented in part through the use of ``increments''and area classifications for the pollutants sulfur dioxide and particulatematter. An increment is the maximum increase (above a baseline concentration)in the ambient concentration of a pollutant that would be allowed in anarea. The area classification scheme establishes three classes of geographicareas and applies more stringent increments to those areas recognized ashaving higher air quality values (e.g., certain national parks and otherClass I areas).In the 1977 Amendments, Congress specified increments and area classificationprovisions applicable to particulate matter and sulfur dioxide under section163 of the Act. Congress also directed the Administrator, in section 166of the Act, to conduct a study and then to promulgate regulations to preventsignificant deterioration resulting from emissions of hydrocarbons, carbonmonoxide, photochemical oxidants, and nitrogen oxides, as well as pollutantsfor which NAAQS would be established after the passage of the 1977 Amendments.Following the enactment of section 166, EPA began to analyze the technological,economic, and policy issues involved in establishing a PSD regulation fornitrogen oxides and these other pollutants. In 1980, EPA published an advancenotice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) that described 10 regulatory alternativesthe Agency was considering incorporating into the PSD program for thesepollutants and requested public comment on these alternatives. Numerouscomments were received in response to the ANPR asserting that the optionslisted in the ANPR were too costly or would greatly restrict growth. Afterconsidering these comments, the development of these PSD regulations wascanceled by EPA in 1981.In 1986, the Sierra Club and others filed a citizens suit in the U.S. DistrictCourt for the Northern District of California against the Administrator(<T3>Sierra Club, et al.,</T3> v.<T3> Thomas,</T3> No. C-86-0971WWS). The plaintiffs sought to compel EPAto promulgate regulations under section 166 for nitrogen oxides. In April1987, the Court directed the Administrator to conduct a regulatory developmentprogram for nitrogen oxides under a specified schedule. The Court calledfor publication of the proposed regulations for nitrogen oxides no laterthan February 9, 1988, and promulgation of final regulations no later thanOctober 9, 1988. This proposed rulemaking is being undertaken in responseto the mandate of section 166 and follows the schedule set forth by theDistrict Court for completing these regulations. The rulemaking will complementthe BACT, Class I area protection, and other measures to which major sourcesof nitrogen oxides are already subject by establishing ambient incrementsand a corresponding area classification scheme for nitrogen dioxide. Thus,the rulemaking will complete EPA's PSD obligations as to this pollutant.The increments proposed today would apply directly only to major stationarysources of nitrogen oxides. However, because aggregate mobile source emissionsof nitrogen oxides are significant, EPA is proposing that such emissionsbe considered in assessing the increment available to stationary sources.B. Statutory ContextThe PSD program mandated by Congrress is required to balance three primarygoals, as specified by section 160 of the Act. The first of these goalsis to protect public health and welfare. This goal includes the preventionof significant deterioration of air quality in all areas where the ambientpollutant concentrations required by the NAAQS are currently being achieved.The second goal emphasizes the protection of air quality in national parks,wilderness areas, and similar areas of special concern where air qualityis considered particularly important. The third goal is to ensure thateconomic growth in clean areas occurs only after careful deliberation byState and local communities.The particular requirements for the PSD regulations under section 166 ofthe Act are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Such regulations shall provide specific numerical measures againstwhich permit applications may be evaluated, a framework for stimulatingimproved control technology, protection of air quality values, and fulfillthe goals and purposes set forth in section 101 and section 160.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) The regulations * * * shall provide specific measures at leastas effective as the increments established in section 163 to fulfill suchgoals and purposes, and may contain air quality increments, emission densityrequirements, or other measures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Numerical Measures  </ITAG>The first step in developing regulations for nitrogen oxides under section166 is to define deterioration using specific numerical measures. Theseproposed regulations for nitrogen dioxides follow the particulate matterand sulfur dioxide regulations under section 163 by establishing maximumincreases (increments) in ambient air concentrations (expressed in microgramsper cubic meter, or andCx.18;g/m\3\) allowed over a baseline concentration.These increments represent the maximum deterioration in air quality thatwould be allowed in a PSD area from both stationary and mobile sourcesand are implemented through a series of permit review procedures applicableto major new or modified stationary sources. The impacts on ambient pollutionlevels of the construction and operation of a new or modified source subjectto PSD review are calculated using mathematical models, and a determinationis made as to whether the particular project under consideration, in conjunctionwith other applicable increases and decreases, would result in the incrementsbeing exceeded.  The increment provisions established by Congress for particulate matterand sulfur dioxide also include a three-tiered area classification schemewhich recognizes that the need for prevention of significant deteriorationin air quality may be greater in some geographic areas than others (seeClean Air Act, sections 162-164). Congress established Class I areas asareas of special national concern where the need to prevent significantdeterioration in air quality is greatest. Class I areas include certainnational parks and wilderness areas. Class II areas are, initially, allPSD areas that are not designated in the Act as Class I areas. The finalclassification established by Congress, Class III, permits more deteriorationover baseline concentrations. This classification is available for specificareas designated by the States for higher levels of industrial developmentand other emissions growth. There are as yet no Class III areas.   Section 166 of the Act specifies that EPA is not required to adopt thearea classification scheme for other pollutants. With respect to nitrogenoxides, however, EPA believes that this approach will contribute to theaccomplishment of the goals of the PSD regulatory program and notes thatit has been successfully implemented in the PSD regulatory program forparticulate matter and sulfur dioxide. In addition, a substantial bodyof experience with administration of the area classification system hasdeveloped within EPA and other agencies charged with implementation ofthe PSD program, and a network of institutional arrangements exists toimplement this scheme effectively. Consequently, EPA has determined thatthe three-tiered classification scheme is reasonable and appropriate forthe section 166 regulations for nitrogen oxides.  The 1980 ANPR discussed a number of possible alternative forms for a section166 regulation for nitrogen oxides. Most of these alternatives, however,can more properly be classified as alternative methods for implementinga regulation under section 166. Since most of these alternatives wouldnot specify the amount of deterioration considered significant under section166, it would be difficult to compare their effectiveness. The implementationmethod used in the particulate matter and sulfur dioxide PSD regulatoryprogram and proposed in this regulation today relies on direct enforcementof the increment on a case-by-case basis through evaluation of preconstructionpermit applications and air quality monitoring and modeling. At this time,none of the alternatives discussed in the 1980 ANPR appear to provide anygreater protection than direct enforcement of the increment. However, EPAmay provide in the promulgated rule an opportunity for States to proposean equivalent alternative implementation method in the SIP each submits.These alternative implementation measures are discussed in more detailin section III.D. of this preamble, ``Alternative Implementation Methods.''<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Stimulating Improved Control Technology  </ITAG>Stimulating improved air pollution control technology through an incrementregulation is primarily a function of the stringency of the increment.A number of factors may affect the selection of the control technologyfor an individual facility. These include the growth in emissions fromsources located in close proximity to each other, the amount of incrementremaining in an area when a permit application is received, and the stringencyof the BACT requirement that would have applied in the absence of constraintsimposed by the increments. However, as discussed below, the only one ofthese factors which can be directly varied in this rulemaking is the stringencyof the increments.Because geographic areas can be expected to experience economic growthand development at different rates, the rate of consumption of PSD incrementswill differ between regions. Over time, as a given PSD increment levelis approached, the level of control required to avoid causing exceedanceof the increment becomes more stringent. Consequently, new or modifiedsources in such localities may have to install control technologies moreeffective than those normally considered representative of BACT in orderto comply with the increment, or to preserve some portion of the incrementfor future economic growth. In States where air quality problems (suchas possible increment exceedances) result in stringent control requirementsfor nitrogen oxides, the technologies applied to new sources will generallybe more stringent than those currently required elsewhere. Because BACTdeterminations include an examination of the most stringent control technologiesavailable, it is reasonable to expect that over time the control technologiesutilized in these problem areas will become the basis of BACT determinationselsewhere. As technologies become more common, their costs tend to fall.This, in turn, tends to increase the frequency of their application. Theeffectiveness of different increment levels in stimulating improved controltechnologies is discussed in section II, ``Selection of Increments.''<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Protection of Class I and Other Special Areas</ITAG>In section 160(2) of the Act, Congress set forth the purposes of Part C.The second of these is a general PSD goal of protecting air quality inall national parks, wilderness areas, monuments, seashores, and other areasof ``special national or regional natural, recreational, scenic or historicvalue.'' A more specific concern is evidenced in the area classificationand increment scheme in sections 161 through 164 of the Act, applicableto sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. That scheme designates a mandatorysubset of these special areas as mandatory Class I areas and allows onlya small incremental increase in ambient pollution levels. Similarly, Congresscreated another subset of mandatory Class II areas.In addition to the statutory increment provisions addressing air qualitydirectly, Congress charged Federal land managers (FLM's) in section 165(d)(2)(B),with an affirmative responsibility to protect the ``air quality relatedvalues (including visibility)'' (AQRV's) of Class I areas, and to considerwhether a proposed major new or modified source would have an adverse impacton AQRV's. In general, protection of AQRV's in the PSD program refers tothe preservation of the environmental, social, aesthetic, and economicbenefits that accrue to Class I areas by virtue of their air quality. Thus,AQRV's are directly dependent on low ambient concentrations of pollutants.Section 165(d)(2)(C) provides a mechanism for denial of a PSD permit insome circumstances where the proposed source would adversely affect AQRV'seven if the Class I increment would not be exceeded.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. ``At Least As Effective As''</ITAG>The requirement of section 166(d) that the PSD regulations for nitrogenoxides be ``at least as effective as'' the PSD increments for sulfur dioxideand particulate matter requires an analysis of the projected impacts ofincorporating an increment into the nitrogen oxides regulation. In developingthese proposed regulations, a range of alternative increments was examinedto determine how they compare in terms of technology requirements, costs,product price impacts, cost effectiveness, and impacts on ambient air qualityin selected areas. The comparison of these alternatives and the impactsof each are discussed in section II, ``Selection of Increments.''<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Selection of Increments</ITAG>A. Selection of Increment Stringency OptionsTo determine the level of stringency that would accomplish the two goalsof stimulating the development of technology and being ``at least as effectiveas'' the existing PSD increments, a set of alternative increment levelswas developed. These alternative levels were evaluated to determine whichones are ``at least as effective as'' the increment-based regulations forsulfur dioxide and particulate matter in achieving the goals and purposesof the PSD program. These evaluations focused initially on the selectionof an increment for Class II areas because these areas are expected toshow the greatest impacts of the regulation. A discussion of Class I andClass III area increments follow the description of the national impactsof the alternative increments on Class II areas.The first alternative increment level, 100 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (annual average),was chosen as the ``base case'' in this analysis. This level of ambientnitrogen dioxide concentration is the same as the NAAQS for nitrogen dioxide,and represents the constraint on ambient concentrations that is alreadyin effect through direct application of the NAAQS. The next alternativeincrement level chosen was 25 andCx.18;g/m\3\, which represents an incrementlevel that is equivalent to the level established for sulfur dioxide andparticulate matter in terms of a proportion of the annual NAAQS. Two additionalalternative increments were selected at 45 and 35 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in orderto evaluate less stringent increment levels. Similarly, an alternativeincrement was selected at 15 andCx.18;g/m\3\ so that the impacts of an incrementmore stringent than those for particulate matter and sulfur dioxide couldbe examined.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Relationship to NAAQS</ITAG>In establishing the PSD regulations for sulfur dioxide and particulatematter, Congress used the NAAQS for those pollutants as the benchmark fordetermining what constitutes ``significant deterioration,'' setting increments(with certain exceptions) as a percentage of the NAAQS level for each pollutant,and using the same averaging time and units of measurement as the NAAQS(andCx.18;g/m\3\). Because of this precedent, and because the NAAQS constitutethe basic measure of air quality under the Act, the EPA has reached thepreliminary conclusion that the regulations for nitrogen oxides under section166 should also be established by reference to the NAAQS.The NAAQS for control of nitrogen oxides is based on annual average ambientconcentrations of nitrogen dioxide. Nitrogen dioxide is the most commonof the nitrogen oxides and has been documented to have adverse effectson human health and welfare (see <T3>Air Quality Criteria for Oxides of Nitrogen, </T3>EPA 600/8-82-026).In basing the PSD increment on the NAAQS, it follows that the incrementshould be based on annual average ambient concentrations of nitrogen dioxide.On June 19, 1985, the EPA published a final rule that retained the annualaverage NAAQS for nitrogen dioxide and concluded that a short-term nitrogendioxide NAAQS was not justified. In making this decision, the EPA concludedthat:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * there is insufficient scientific evidence to support decisionson a short-term standard level, averaging time, and number of allowableexceedances which would be required to propose a separate short-term standard.At the same time, the possibility of adverse health effects cannot be ruledout. [50 FR 25536]</ITAG>Consequently, EPA proposes that the increment be stated as an increasein the annual average ambient concentration of nitrogen dioxide. The EPAis currently conducting a research program to reduce the scientific uncertaintiesconcerning short-term nitrogen dioxide exposures. Should a short-term NAAQSfor nitrogen dioxide be established, EPA will review and reconsider theneed for a short-term PSD increment for nitrogen dioxide.The annual sulfur dioxide and particulate matter increments for Class IIareas were established by Congress at 25 percent of the annual NAAQS foreach pollutant. This can be interpreted as a Congressional determinationof what level of increase in ambient concentration of an air pollutantis considered ``significant.'' By this measure, the nitrogen dioxide incrementshould be at least as stringent in terms of ambient air quality impactsin order to provide the same level of effectiveness in preventing significantdeterioration of air quality. An increment set above this level might theoreticallyachieve the same level of protection relative to the NAAQS as is achievedby the sulfur dioxide and particulate matter increments if, for example,the same degree of emission reduction ended up being required in all cases.However, the analyses conducted in conjunction with this rulemaking indicatethat this does not occur, but rather that a higher increment level wouldallow additional emissions beyond those permitted by an increment of 25percent of the NAAQS. A discussion of increment impacts is presented insection II.C.Based on this consideration, the nitrogen dioxide increment, to be equivalent,should be set at a level of 25 andCx.18;g/m3. The alternative increment levelsof 35 and 45 andCx.18;g/m3 would not be considered ``at least as effectiveas'' the sulfur dioxide and particulate matter increments in preventingthe significant deterioration of air quality, while the alternative incrementof 25 andCx.18;g/m3 would be as effective and the 15 andCx.18;g/m3 incrementwould be more effective than the sulfur dioxide increment.As indicated above, EPA has relied primarily on the relationship betweenthe congressionally-established increments for sulfur dioxide and particulatematter and the NAAQS for those pollutants in determining what nitrogendioxide increments under section 166 would be ``at least as effective as''the statutory increments in section 163 in preventing significant deteriorationof air quality. Thus, EPA has interpreted section 166 as a Congressionaldetermination that limiting increases in ambient air concentrations ofnitrogen oxides to roughly the same percentage of the NAAQS that Congressallowed under section 163 would be ``at least as effective as'' the section163 increments in fulfilling the goals and purposes of the PSD program.However, by focusing on the ambient concentrations as a proxy for all thePSD purposes set forth in the statute, EPA chose not to consider directlyand in depth the relative actual effectiveness of given sulfur dioxide,particulate matter, and nitrogen dioxide increments in fulfilling the purposesof the PSD program, most notably the purpose listed in section 160(1) toprotect against actual or potential adverse effects on public health andwelfare.EPA's Criteria Documents and Regulatory Impact Analyses examining effortsto control particulate matter, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides suggestthat particulate matter, sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides present differinghealth and welfare concerns. For example, soiling is much more sensitiveto emissions of particulate matter than to nitrogen oxides. Thus, it ispossible that nitrogen dioxide concentrations at levels below the NAAQSpresent greater or lesser potential adverse effects than do sulfur dioxideor particulate matter concentrations at corresponding levels below theNAAQS for those pollutants. This is of particular concern because reductionsin the nitrogen oxides emissions baseline in future years (e.g. 1995 and2000) could increase ozone in some nonattainment areas. In fact, EPA'spost-1987 ozone and carbon monoxide strategy suggests that changes in nitrogenoxides emissions can adversely affect ozone levels in ozone nonattainmentareas. The nitrogen oxides role in ozone formation varies across regions,both positively and negatively. Given this concern, it may be appropriateto consider the risks associated with increased ozone in nonattainmentareas when determining a nitrogen oxides PSD increment that is ``at leastas effective'' as the sulfur dioxide and particulate matter PSD increments.If these parameters were to be considered by EPA, the Agency might concludethat nitrogen dioxide increments that represent different percentages ofthe NAAQS from those used in section 163 are ``at least as effective as''the section increments in fulfilling this statutory purpose. This alternativeapproach merits serious consideration during the public comment period.In light of the above, EPA solicits comment on these two issues associatedwith this alternative approach to section 166 rules. First, is it reasonableto interpret the statute as allowing a comparative assessment of severityof effects from various criteria pollutants in establishing numerical incrementsunder section 166? Second, what data and analyses are available for documentingand assessing the comparative effects of different criteria pollutantswith respect to fulfilling the PSD goals of the Clean Air Act?<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Control Technology Requirements</ITAG>In addition to the relationship to the NAAQS, the level of technology requiredto meet the proposed increment is another measure that could be used todetermine if an increment fulfills the requirements of section 166. Theuse of this measure rests on Congress' determination that the levels chosenfor the sulfur dioxide and particulate matter increments provided for theproper level of technological control without placing an unreasonable economicburden on the affected facilities and industries. In order to evaluateeconomic effect, an analysis was conducted to determine the nitrogen oxidesemission control technologies that would be required to achieve compliancewith each of the alternative increment levels. The technology requirementsassociated with each alternative increment were then compared with thebaseline control technologies required under the existing PSD regulations,which require BACT emission controls for nitrogen oxides.Because BACT determinations are made on a case-by-case basis by the individualStates, these determinations vary in the specific nitrogen oxides emissioncontrol technologies required. As discussed earlier, in section I, someStates have imposed more stringent technology requirements than others.For this reason, identifying a level of technology to represent the basecase is a complex task. Although different emission control technologyrequirements could be used as the BACT base case to portray the impactsof the alternative nitrogen dioxide increments, one base case technologylevel was used in this analysis. This base case represents the least stringentof the technologies required by BACT determinations made under provisionsof the existing PSD regulations. The EPA expects that more stringent BACTdeterminations will be typical of the PSD program in the future and notesthat more stringent technological controls are required by some Statesat the present time. The single base case was used in these analyses, however,because it reflects the most severe potential economic impacts of the alternativeincrement requirements. If the economic impacts of an increment are consideredreasonable when compared with this relatively lenient base case, raisingthe stringency of the BACT requirements would only reduce those economicimpacts.B. Class II Increment AnalysesThree analyses were conducted on the economic impacts of the technologyrequirements of the alternative increments. The first analysis examinedthe impacts of those alternative increments on model facilities which arerepresentatives of the individual existing facilities in each of the industrialcategories expected to be affected most severely by the nitrogen dioxideincrement regulations. This analysis is described in detail in the docketfor this rulemaking in a document entitled ``Model Plant Emission Reductionand Control Cost Impacts.'' In this model facilities analysis, the focuswas on the cost to the individual source or firm of installing and operatingthe control technologies required to comply with the increment and on theresulting increases in prices projected for the products manufactured atthe facility.The second set of analyses evaluates the impacts of the alternative incrementson an areawide basis. These area analyses evaluate the impact of the consumptionof increment by all of the potential sources located in two types of geographicareas on the construction of new or modified sources. One area is a highgrowth urban area with significant nitrogen oxides emissions from mobilesources. The focus of this urban area analysis is on the potential constraintsposed by mobile source emissions. The other area is a rural area with ahigh rate of growth in stationary sources, rather than in mobile sources.The focus of the rural area analysis is on the impacts of concentratedstationary source siting. Additionally, as a preparatory step toward theperformance of the third part of the analysis_the national impacts analysis_thearea impacts were examined to determine whether costs and impacts associatedwith the consumption of increment by sources other than the PSD permitapplicant should be included in the national costs. The urban and ruralarea analyses are described in detail in the docket in two documents entitled``Urban Area Air Quality Impact Analysis'' and ``Alaska Ambient NitrogenDioxide Impact Analysis.''The national impacts analysis itself focused on the annualized costs, emissionsreductions, cost effectiveness, and administrative costs associated withthe alternative increment levels. A detailed description of the methodologyand results of this analysis are contained in the docket in two documentsentitled ``National Cost Estimates for Proposed NO<T2>x</T2> Increment Regulation'' and ``NO<T2>2</T2> Increment Administrative Costs.''<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Model Facilities Analysis </ITAG>The source types analyzed in the model facilities analysis are those industrialcategories and specific types of emission sources that are most likelyto be affected by PSD regulations for nitrogen oxides. Based on a reviewof PSD permits issued to new and modified sources between 1977 and 1984(comprising the ``new source review'' or ``NSR'' data base), the sourcetypes expected to be most affected by the increment regulation and, consequently,selected for analysis were: chemical processing plants, natural gas andcrude oil pumping stations, steam electric generating plants (includingcogeneration facilities), petroleum refineries, kraft pulp mills, and naturalgas processing plants. Municipal solid waste incineration facilities werealso selected for analysis because they are expected to be an active sourcecategory in the future, even though they are not a frequent source typein the NSR data base. For each of the source types selected for evaluation,the NSR data base was used to determine representative plant configurationsthat would represent the plants with the potential for the highest ambientnitrogen dioxide concentrations.The control technologies required to comply with the alternative incrementlevels were examined to determine if there are technologies available oranticipated which will enable the model facilities to comply with the alternativeincrements. If compliance with an alternative increment is technologicallyinfeasible in many locations, that increment could be significantly morestringent than either the particulate matter or sulfur dioxide increments.Further, although the increment selected should be feasible, incrementsshould also stimulate technological development in nitrogen oxides control.Based on the analysis of the control technologies required to comply withthe alternative increments, the EPA has determined that, as anticipated,the technology-forcing aspects of the alternative increments become moresignificant as the increments become more stringent. Further, the EPA hasdetermined that, with one exception, each of the alternative incrementscan be achieved by model facilities using available or anticipated nitrogenoxides emission control technologies. The only exception to this conclusionis a limited one. In the unlikely event that a major chemical process plantis proposed for an urban area, there are no technologies available to meetan increment of 25 andCx.18;g/m\3\ under adverse meteorological conditions.The 15 andCx.18;g/m\3\ increment cannot be achieved in urban areas underany of the meteorological conditions modeled. It should be noted that thisanalysis is based on impacts projected using nonreactive air quality screeningmodels. These models assume that all nitrogen oxides emitted are convertedinto nitrogen dioxide as soon as they enter the atmosphere. Since not allthe nitrogen oxides emissions are immediately converted into nitrogen dioxide,this assumption results in an overstatement of the impacts of the chemicalprocess plant emissions. The calculated air quality impacts would be expectedto be lower if more sophisticated reactive models, which require site-specificdata, were used in connection with specific PSD permit applications.The costs of the alternative increments were also examined for the modelfacilities to determine the economic impacts of these technology requirements.In addition to showing that the control requirements become more expensiveto install and operate as the increment becomes more stringent, the costimpact analysis shows that the increase in costs is significantly greaterfor some model facilities when going from the 25 andCx.18;g/m\3\ to the 15andCx.18;g/m\3\ increments than for any other increase in the stringencyof the increment levels.The costs of the control technologies required under the alternative incrementswere used to calculate the effects of the increments on the price of productsproduced by the industries represented by the model facilities. In thisscreening analysis, it was assumed that a product price increase resultingfrom the imposition of an increment would be significant if it exceeds5 percent. The conclusion of the product price analysis is that there areno product price impacts, or only insignificant impacts, resulting fromthe imposition of a 45, 35, or 25 andCx.18;g/m\3\ increment for nitrogendioxide. For these alternative increments, the product price increasesrange from 0 to 3.3 percent. At an increment level of 15 andCx.18;g/m\3\,however, product price increases of over 5 percent are possible. Consequently,the economic impacts of a 15 andCx.18;g/m\3\ increment could potentiallybe significant for some source types. For those sources, more refined analyseswould be needed to determine whether increases of over 5 percent wouldactually occur.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Area Analysis</ITAG>The focus of the area analysis is to determine what the impact of a nitrogenoxides regulation would be on typical high growth urban and rural areassubject to the PSD program.a. <T3>Urban Area Impact Analysis. </T3>The goal of the urban area impactanalysis is to determine how increases in nitrogen oxides emissions bymobile sources influence the availability of nitrogen dioxide incrementsfor new or modified stationary sources in high growth urban areas. Nitrogenoxides emissions from mobile sources consume increment after the minorsource baseline date has been triggered, posing a potential problem forthe siting of new PSD sources. The urban area impact analysis focuses ona single urban area in order to determine what growth in nitrogen oxidesemissions is anticipated and whether the consumption of increment by mobilesources places a serious limitation on the location of industrial facilitiesin high growth urban areas.The results of the urban area impact analysis indicate that the consumptionof increment by mobile sources should not be a constraining factor in thelocation of new stationary sources or on the modification of stationarysources in high growth urban areas in the near term (through 1994). Althoughthe number of vehicle miles traveled in high growth urban areas is anticipatedto increase steadily throughout the study period, the overall quantityof nitrogen oxides emitted is projected to decrease through 1994. Thisis the result of a decrease in the emissions per vehicle mile traveleddue to emission control requirements established pursuant to the FederalMotor Vehicle Control program administered by EPA.As a result of this decrease in annual emissions, it is projected thatnitrogen oxides emissions from mobile sources will not result in significantconstraints on the location of new or modified industrial sources in PSDareas subject to a nitrogen dioxide increment. Instead, the reduction inmobile source emissions resulting from the implementation of emission controlson motor vehicles would result in an expansion of the increment through1994. The expansion provides emission reductions which offset new industrialemissions. Starting in 1995, emissions of nitrogen oxides may begin toincrease as motor vehicle miles traveled increase without compensatingimprovements in emission controls for motor vehicles.The urban area impact analysis indicates that the imposition of any ofthe alternative increments would have little impact on the location ofnew or modified sources in a high growth urban area. Improvements in mobilesource emissions controls will, in effect, expand the increment availableuntil 1995. On a localized level, there may be sites within an urban areawhere vehicle traffic is low and increment expansion is less significant.At these sites, a more stringent increment might pose constraints on anew or modified source. Overall, however, the expansion of industrial andmobile sources in a high growth urban area should not be constrained byany of the alternative increment levels examined.b. <T3>Rural Growth Impact Analysis</T3>. The rural growth impact analysiswas conducted to determine the impacts of nitrogen dioxides increment onrural areas that are projected to experience significant increases in nitrogenoxides emissions from industrial growth. In contrast to the urban areagrowth analysis, the rural analysis concentrated on nitrogen oxides emissionsand ambient nitrogen dioxide concentrations resulting from stationary pointsources located in close proximity to each other, rather than emissionsfrom mobile sources.For this analysis, a rural area was selected which has experienced andis expected to continue to experience substantial stationary source growth.The Prudhoe Bay area of Alaska was selected for this analysis to representan extreme case of emissions growth in a rural area. Prudhoe Bay is a ruralarea that is the site of a major industrial complex associated with theproduction and transportation of petroleum and natural gas. Analysis ofthe impact of industrial growth at Prudhoe Bay during the period 1980 through1987 on nitrogen oxides emissions shows that actual annual emissions haveincreased by approximately 35,080 tons. Permits have been approved foran additional 10,240 tons of emissions for plants which are not yet inservice.The analysis shows that, as a result of this emissions growth, only the45 andCx.18;g/m\3\ increment alternative would not have been exceeded inPrudhoe Bay, taking into account growth since 1980. All other incrementlevels would have been exceeded at current levels of emissions. Actualair quality impacts, however, are probably much less. This type of analysisprovides a very conservative estimate of increment consumption, since itis based on ``allowable'' emissions rather than ``actual'' emissions. Allowableemissions estimates assume continuous operation at full load so, for anannual average, tend to show higher air quality impacts than would be thecase if actual emissions were used. If a contemporaneous baseline dateis selected, the contraint on the future development of the Prudhoe Bayarea would be in direct proportion to the stringency of the increment andthe rate of increase in actual nitrogen oxides emissions.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. National Cost Impacts Analysis </ITAG>The annualized costs of the alternative increments were calculated forthe fifth year after the effective date of the regulations. For the 45andCx.18;g/m \3\ increment, the national annualized costs of the regulationexceed $7.5 million (in 1987 dollars). The national annualized costs ofthe 35 andCx.18;g/m \3\ incement in the fifth year increase to $25.2 million.For the 25 andCx.18;g/m \3\ increment, the costs increase to $63.7 millionand at the most stringent increment level, 15 andCx.18;g/m 3, costs quadrupleto $236 million. The national average cost effectiveness of nitrogen oxides control at eachincrement level was determined compared to base case, as was the incrementalcost effectiveness of each increment relative to the next less stringentalternative increment. At an increment of 45 andCx.18;g/m 3, the averageand incremental cost effectiveness of nitrogen oxides control over thebase case control level is $875 per ton of nitrogen oxides emission reduction.At an increment of 35 andCx.18;g/m 3, the average cost effectiveness is $1,051per ton and the incremental cost effectiveness is $1.150 per ton. The 25andCx.18;g/m 3 has an average cost effectiveness of $1.106 per ton, and anincremental cost effectiveness of $1,128 per ton. The national costs of the increments also include the administrative costsof the PSD program. Among other costs, these administrative burdens includethe cost to the PSD permit applicant for the preparation of the permitapplication and for the collection and analysis of ambient air qualitydata. For the agency reviewing the application, the administrative costsinclude a determination of the applicability of the regulations to a specificproposed project, as well as the review of the application itself. Basedon estimates of the time required to perform these functions in the typicalcase, it is anticipated that the total annual administrative cost of thePSD regulations for nitrogen oxides to applicants will be approximately$400,000. For the reviewing agencies, the total overall administrativecost impact is expected to be $150,000 per year. It is not anticipatedthat these costs will vary significantly with the level of stringency ofthe increment selected. C. Selection of Class II Increment Four factors were examined to determine the nitrogen dioxide incrementlevel for Class II areas that is ``at least as effective as'' the particulatematter and sulfur dioxide increments in achieving the goals of the PSDprogram. First, the relationship between the NAAQS for particulate matterand sulfur dioxide and the PSD increments for those pollutants was examined.On this basis, it was determined that a nitrogen dioxide increment of 25andCx.18;g/m 3 in Class II areas achieved a level of protection relativeto the NAAQS for nitrogen dioxide that is ``at least as effective as''the increments for particulate matter and sulfur dioxide. It was also determinedthat a nitrogen dioxide increment of 15 andCx.18;g/m 3  could be considered``more effective'' than the particulate matter and sulfur dioxide incrementswhen compared to the NAAQS levels. Second, the product price increases resulting from the alternative incrementlevels were examined. In this analysis, no direct comparison was made betweenthe economic impacts of the nitrogen dioxide increment and the economicimpacts of the particulate matter and sulfur dioxide increments. Instead,the impacts imposed by the nitrogen dioxide increment were examined todetermine whether they are unreasonable for the affected industries. Becausethe industries and source types affected by the different increment requirementsvary (to a greater degree between nitrogen dioxide and particulate matterand to a lesser degree between nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide), directcost comparisons for model facilities are not informative. Congress determinedthat the economic impacts of the particulate matter and sulfur dioxideincrements are reasonable for the most severely affected industries andsource types. Therefore, a nitrogen dioxide increment which does not causesignificant product price increases is ``at least as effective as'' theparticulate matter and sulfur dioxide increments in avoiding unreasonableeconomic impacts on affected industries and facilities. Based on the modelfacilities analysis, the 25 andCx.18;g/m 3 increment alternative is not consideredto impose unreasonable product price impacts on individual facilities andindustries. A 15 andCx.18;g/m 3 increment, however, would impose unreasonableimpacts on individual facilities under some circumstances. Third, the impacts of the alternative increment levels on representativeareas were evaluated in order to determine whether the nitrogen dioxideincrement levels would pose unreasonable constraints on growing urban andrural areas. In many high growth urban areas, it is expected that improvementsin mobile source emission controls over the next 5 to 10 years will resultin an overall improvement in ambient nitrogen dioxide concentrations. Therefore,no significant adverse impacts are expected in high growth urban areasfrom any of the alternative increments over the period of time analyzed.For rural areas where mobile sources are less important sources of nitrogenoxides emissions, the impacts of the increments may be more constrainingwhere industrial growth is high, such as Prudhoe Bay, especially at 25and 15 andCx.18;g/m 3. This result is consistent with the effects that theparticulate matter and sulfur dioxide increments have had on balancingeconomic activity and air quality in PSD areas. Finally, the national impacts of the alternative nitrogen dioxide incrementswere calculated to determine the fifth-year costs of regulations basedon these alternatives. For the 45, 35, and 25 andCx.18;g/m 3 increment levels,the national fifth-year costs remain well below $100 million, and consequentlyare not expected to have severe economic effects on these industries. Forthe 15 andCx.18;g/m 3 increment, however, the fifth-year costs quadrupleover the costs of the 25 andCx.18;g/m 3 increment to $236 million and couldhave a significant impact on the affected industries. Based on these separate analyses of the legal and economic aspects of incrementselection, the 25 andCx.18;g/m 3 increment is proposed as the increment forClass II areas. This increment level appears to fulfill the statutory requirementof being ``at least as effective as'' the current annual increments forparticulate matter and sulfur dioxide; is expected to provide a more stringentlevel of technological control of nitrogen oxides emissions from the sourcecategories most affected by the standard than either the 35 or 45 andCx.18;g/m3 alternatives; and finally, unlike the 15 andCx.18;g/m 3 increment, doesnot result in the imposition of unreasonable product price impacts on theaffected facilities or industries. D. Class I Analysis The annual average sulfur dioxide and particulate matter increments forClass I areas are based on smaller percentages of their respective NAAQSthan are the increments for Class II areas. This relationship between ClassI and Class II areas represents Congress' determination to allow less deteriorationof air quality in national parks, wilderness areas, and similar areas.For particulate matter, the annual Class I increment of 5 andCx.18;g/m \3\is 6.7 percent of the NAAQS for particulate matter. For sulfur dioxide,the annual Class I increment of 2 andCx.18;g/m \3\ is 2.5 percent of theNAAQS for sulfur dioxide. In terms of types of sources that generate nitrogen oxides, there is agreater similarity between nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide than particulatematter. Both nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide are generated primarilyby stationary combustion sources, including boilers and process heaters.The exception to this generalization is that nitrogen oxides are also emittedin substantial amounts by mobile sources, as discussed above in the areaanalysis. Nitrogen oxides and nitrogen dioxide also react and are transportedin the atmosphere in ways which are more closely linked to sulfur dioxidethan to particulate matter. Because of these similarities, it was decidedto set the Class I increment for nitrogen dioxides at 2.5 percent of theNAAQS for nitrogen dioxide, following the pattern set for sulfur dioxiderather than particulate matter. Therefore, the proposed Class I incrementfor nitrogen dioxide is 2.5 andCx.18;g/m \3\. It should be noted that section 165(d)(2)(C)(iii) and (iv) of the Act containsprovisions whereby an FLM may certify to the permitting agency that a particularfacility will have no adverse impact on air quality-related values in theClass I area, even though the increment may be exceeded. Pursuant to thiscertification, the permitting agency may issue a permit for the facility.Even if such a waiver is recognized and the permit issued, the ambientconcentrations are constrained from increasing by more than an amount which,for the sulfur dioxide and particulate matter regulations, is equal tothe Class II increment. This same provision will also be made applicableto the proposed nitrogen dioxide increment, with a proposed cap on thedeterioration of ambient air quality set at 25 andCx.18;g/m \3\. Althoughuse of these waiver provisions is expected to be uncommon in practice,it does provide a mechanism whereby the stringency of a Class I incrementcan be modified under appropriate circumstances. One aspect of Class I areas that is important to this rulemaking is theimpact of the construction of new or modified stationary sources in ClassII areas on the air quality in nearby Class I areas, and, conversely, theconstraints imposed by the presence of a Class I area on such constructionin Class II areas. To evaluate these impacts, an analysis was performedof selected past PSD permit applications reviewed by the National ParkService and the Fish and Wildlife Service of the U.S. Department of theInterior between 1979 and 1986 that had potential Class I implications.This analysis is described in the docket in a document entitled ``BaselineDate Issue Paper'' and summarized briefly in the following paragraphs.For these applications, the distance between the nitrogen oxides sourceand the impacted Class I area ranged between 17 and 90 kilometers, andannual emissions were stated as ranging from 44 to over 44,000 tons ofnitrogen oxides. The impact of these facilities on ambient concentrationsof nitrogen dioxide in Class I areas was estimated based on informationcontained in the applications. This analysis indicated that the expectedimpacts of these facilities on nitrogen dioxide concentrations in the affectedClass I areas would, in all likelihood, be less than 1.0 andCx.18;g/m \3\in all cases. Further, it was concluded that past patterns of stationarysources sitting would not be constrained by the 2.5 andCx.18;g/m \3\ ClassI increment. To evaluate the impacts of a 2.5 andCx.18;g/m \3\ Class I increment, thecontribution of mobile sources to ambient nitrogen oxides concentrationswas also evaluated for two of the most frequently visited national parks_AcadiaNational Park and Great Smoky Mountains National Park. As with the urbanarea analysis described above, improved emissions controls on newer automobilesare projected to result in an overall reduction in ambient nitrogen dioxidelevels in these parks, even though the vehicle miles traveled are expectedto increase. Consequently, mobile source emissions should not contributeto increment violations of the 2.5 andCx.18;g/m \3\ nitrogen dioxide incrementand, hence, the increment should not constrain vehicle traffic in ClassI areas in the near-term. E. Class III Analysis Increments were established for Class III areas in the Act for sulfur dioxideand particulate matter. This designation is permitted in order to giveStates a mechanism for accommodating economic growth and air quality inareas where the Class II increment is too stringent to allow the sitingof new or modified sources. Procedures specified by the Act in order fora State to redesignate an area as Class III require the commitment of theState government to creation of such an area, extensive public review,participation in the SIP area redesignation process, and a finding thatthe redesignation will not result in the increment being exceeded in anyother Class I or II area. To date, no area of the country has been redesignatedas Class III for sulfur dioxide or particulate matter. For the sulfur dioxide and particulate matter PSD regulations, the ClassIII increment is set at 50 percent of the NAAQS, approximately twice thelevel of the Class II increment. Following this pattern, a nitrogen dioxideincrement for Class III areas of 50 andCx.18;g/m \3\ is being proposed. Theanalysis conducted in this rulemaking indicate that the Class II incrementshould not pose a serious constraint on economic activity in most areasof the country. Consequently, it is not anticipated that the Class IIIdesignation will be used in the foreseeable future. <ITAG tagnum="84">III Implementation </ITAG>A. Baseline Date In an increment system, the ``baseline date'' marks the date after whichincreases in a pollutant in an area consume increment. Hence, it is animportant factor in determining the overall stringency of the increment.For sulfur dioxide and particulate matter, as defined in section 169(4)of the Act and 40 CFR 51.166(b)(13), the ambient concentration on the baselinedate is the baseline concentration against which increment consumptionis measured. All ambient concentrations resulting from: (1) Actual emissionsfrom existing sources, and (2) allowable emissions for certain sourcespermitted, but not yet in operation on that date, are part of the baselineconcentration for those pollutants. The EPA regulations established two baseline dates for particulate matterand sulfur dioxide: the ``major source baseline date'' and the ``minorsource baseline date.'' The major source baseline date is the date afterwhich major stationary sources consume increment, and is a single dateapplied nationwide. The minor source baseline date is the date on whichthe first complete PSD application is submitted in an area, after whichminor source emissions in the baseline area affect increment. The minor source baseline date was, in turn, related to a ``trigger date''(August 7, 1977). The first complete PSD application submitted in an areafor a major source after the trigger date established the minor sourcebaseline date for that area. Applications submitted prior to the triggerdate did not affect the setting of the minor source baseline date. Thissystem has resulted in a wide variety of minor source baseline dates. Someareas still do not have a particulate matter or sulfur dioxide minor sourcebaseline date. Because this approach has proven effective in the implementation of theincrements for particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, the Administratoris proposing a similar approach to the selection of the baseline datesfor the nitrogen dioxide increments. Three options have been studied forthe major source baseline date and for the trigger date for minor sourcebaseline dates. These options are: Option 1_August 7, 1980, for both dates;Option 2_February 8, 1988, for both dates; and Option 3_August 7, 1980,for the major source baseline date, and February 8, 1988, for the triggerdate. Option 1 is based on the date on which a nitrogen dioxide increment wouldhave become effective had EPA met the schedule for development of the PSDregulations for nitrogen oxides set out in section 166 of the Act. Usingthis date would prevent any deterioration which has occurred between 1980and the present from being ``grandfathered,'' but it also constitutes aretroactive application of an effective date, something which EPA has avoidedin new source review programs, including PSD. Option 2 selects the date of proposal of these regulations, February 8,1988, as the uniform baseline date. The use of the date of proposal avoidsretroactive application of the regulation by making owners or operatorsaware of the fact that they will be affected by the nitrogen dioxide incrementsbefore construction begins. It also requires both States and prospectivenew sources to determine ambient concentration levels as of that date forpurposes of future permitting actions. Moreover, selecting the proposaldate as the baseline date would prevent a rush of PSD applications betweenthe proposal date and either the promulgation date (approximately October9, 1988) or the effective date (approximately October 9, 1989). The rushcould occur because nitrogen oxides emissions from major sources with permitsissued prior to the major source baseline date would be a part of the baselineconcentration, would not consume increment, and would not establish theminor source baseline date in that baseline area. The selection of a prospective trigger date, as in Option 2, presents anunusual situation since it could result in the setting of a more stringentbaseline date than would a retrospective trigger date. This is due to thesteadily decreasing contribution of mobile source emissions to ambientair nitrogen dioxide concentrations through 1994. In general, urban area``minor'' source emissions have decreased since 1980 due to improvementsin mobile source emission controls, while rural area ``minor'' source emissionshave increased modestly due to emissions from nonmajor stationary sources,or have remained about the same. Although not specifically analyzed, ruralareas which become urbanized would have experienced moderate emissionsgrowth due to the increased number of mobile sources. A 1980 trigger date,therefore, tends to ``free up'' (expand) the available nitrogen dioxideincrement in urban areas but, in rural areas, the trigger date selectedappears to have little, if any, effect. In rural areas, it is the majorsource baseline date that largely determines the stringency of the incrementbaseline. In effect, a 1980 trigger date would set a baseline concentrationthat is less stringent than a 1988 trigger date (assuming in both casesthat the minor source baseline date is established soon after the triggerdate). For major PSD sources, a 1988 major source baseline date under Option 2``grandfathers'' emissions increases in both urban and rural areas. Inurban areas, the increase in major stationary source emissions may be completelyovershadowed by the mobile source emission decreases since 1980. In ruralareas, mobile source emission decreases since 1980 are usually not sufficientto offset major source emission increases. Thus, in some rural areas, thechoice of a 1980 major source baseline date would significantly diminishthe amount of available growth margin for nitrogen oxides emissions, ascompared to the increment which would be available using a 1988 baselinedate and, in extensive cases, would even require a rollback of existingemissions. For example, several Class I areas now have ambient nitrogendioxide concentrations up to 1.0 andCx.18;g/m\3\ higher than 1980 levels.This is a small absolute increase, but one which represents 40 percentof the proposed Class I increment. In addition, certain Class II areassuch as Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, have ambient concentrations as much as 40andCx.18;g/m\3\ higher than in 1980. This exceeds the proposed 25 andCx.18;g/m\3\Class II increment. Under Option 3, which uses two different baseline dates, the mobile sourceemission decreases over the last 8 years create the unusual effect of makingOption 3 more stringent in urban areas than would have been the case ifthe rule had been put into effect by EPA in 1980, or would now be the caseif EPA chooses Option 1. This is because a 1980 trigger date would havelet the mobile source decreases offset increases from other sources, butOption 3 allows minor sources to affect increment only after February 8,1988. After consideration of the environmental, legal, administrative, and implementationaspects of each option, the Administrator is proposing a prospective baselinedate of February 8, 1988 (Option 2). The proposed regulation thereforereflects only this option. However, compelling data or arguments have notbeen developed for selecting between the three baseline date options. Therefore,although the analyses in this notice and the referenced documents concentrateon an Option 2 scenario, information is included on the other options toprovide data on the effects of alternate baseline dates. The EPA solicitscomments on these options and on the selection of the major source baselinedate and the trigger date for the nitrogen dioxide increment. Also, althoughno information is provided on any other baseline date or trigger date options,it is recognized that there may be valid reasons for selecting differentdates (e.g., the effective date of this regulation). Comments are thereforesolicited on other possible baseline and trigger dates. B. State Implementation Issues There are two main issues regarding implementation of the nitrogen dioxideincrements. The first is timing; the second is the type of analysis required.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Timing </ITAG>There are two distinct timing issues. The first is the timing of the implementationof the nitrogen dioxide increments requirement. The second is a determinationof when permit applications will be required to include a nitrogen dioxideincrement analysis. a. <T3>Program Implementation.</T3> Complete applications for PSD permitsfor sources with significant nitrogen oxides emissions submitted afterthe date on which the nitrogen dioxide increments are implemented mustcontain a demonstration of compliance with nitrogen dioxide incrementsas well as all other PSD requirements. As with other PSD requirements,these increments cannot be implemented with respect to a particular Stateuntil they become part of an applicable implementation plan for that State.Section 166(b) explicitly states that the section 166 regulations becomeeffective one year after promulgation, that SIP revisions accommodatingthe regulations must be submitted within 21 months of the date of promulgation,and that the Administrator must approve or disapprove the SIP revisionswithin 25 months of promulgation, ``in the same manner as required undersection 110.'' Thus, if States fail to submit appropriate SIP revisionswithin these time frames, Congress apparently also contemplated that EPAwould then promulgate the necessary plan revisions directly under the provisionsof section 110(c) of the Act. Implementation dates for the nitrogen dioxideincrements would depend on when the SIP was approved [or when EPA finallypromulgated the revision under section 110(c)]. Some States may submitapprovable SIP's earlier, or could even begin implementation of a Statenitrogen dioxide increment program earlier, but no program would be approvableby EPA earlier than 12 months after promulgation. After incorporation ofthe plan revisions, through action under section 110(c) if necessary, PSDapplicants would be required to adhere to the new nitrogen dioxide increments.Given the explicit language of section 166(b), there seems little doubtthat Congress intended this approach to be followed for at least thoseStates with PSD programs that have been approved as meeting the requirementsof 40 CFR 51.166, and EPA intends to do so for those ``approved'' States.However, only about half of the States have approved PSD programs. Theremaining States still have not submitted approvable programs. In 1978,EPA incorporated the new PSD requirements of the 1977 Amendments in theform of federal regulations at 40 CFR 52.21 into the SIP's of those Stateswithout approved PSD SIP's, pursuant to section 110(c). EPA has since delegatedauthority to issue PSD permits to most of this group of States under 40CFR 52.21(u). As to the balance, EPA still issues PSD permits directly.The continued absence of an approved PSD program in many States raisesa significant question regarding whether EPA should afford these Statesa further period of time after the effective date of the section 166 regulationsto submit an entire approvable PSD program, including the new incrementprovisions, before proceeding to directly promulgate the necessary revisionsto andSection; 52.21. Accordingly, while EPA today proposes to afford allStates a 21 month period to submit their SIP revisions, it will considercomments on whether it should instead put revisions to andSection; 52.21into effect in States without approved programs at the same time as thesection 166 regulations take effect (i.e., 12 months after promulgation).\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Inasmuch as it has already been 10 years_during whichthose States without approved PSD SIP programs have failed to produce theirown programs_it appears unlikely that they will prepare an approvable PSDSIP within 21 months of promulgation of the nitrogen dioxide increments.One position EPA is considering is to amend andSection; 52.21 as of the effectivedate of the nitrogen dioxide increments unless, before that date, the Stateinforms EPA, in writing through an authorized representative, that it intendsto submit a PSD SIP for approval within 21 months of promulgation of theincrements. In all States, EPA has always retained authority to issue permits underandSection; 52.21 directly to sources locating on Indian lands, because Stateslack authority to issue PSD permits on Indian lands. Because sources onIndian lands are not subject to PSD permitting by the States, it is a foregoneconclusion that States could not submit approvable SIP revisions implementingthe increments on Indian lands within their borders. Thus, there is anespecially strong reason for EPA to put the necessary revisions to andSection;52.21 into effect in Indian lands at the same time that the section 166regulations take effect. On the other hand, this action could make areasin and around Indian reservations less attractive places for developmentfor a time when compared to many other areas, and it is questionable whetherCongress ever intended to authorize EPA to create such an uneven patternof development potential. In light of all this, EPA proposes to insertthe necessary revisions to andSection; 52.21 into the SIP's of all Stateswith Indian lands within their borders on the date of promulgation of thesection 166 regulations, and to provide that the revisions will be effectivein those States one year later. Through this mechanism, the regulationswill be implemented without delay. EPA, however, solicits comment on thisand any other implementation issues. b. <T3>Inclusion of Nitrogen Dioxide Increment Analysis in Applications.</T3>The second timing issue involves the date after which PSD permit applicantsmust submit a nitrogen dioxide increment analysis. The increment analysisis used by the reviewing agency to determine whether the applicant wouldcause or contribute to exceedances of the increment. Construction of proposedsources which would do so is prohibited. These analyses rely in part ona determination of emissions changes which have occurred since the baselinedate(s) for an area. The longer the time between a baseline date and thefirst increment analysis, the more difficult it is to locate and reviewold records and complete an inventory of emissions as of that baselinedate. This is one of the difficulties that would result from a baselinedate established in the past (e.g., 1980). Likewise, even if a contemporaneous baseline date (e.g., date of proposalor promulgation, effective date, etc.) is promulgated, applicants and Stateswill find it more difficult to recreate a 1988 emissions inventory in 1990than in 1988. Thus, there is some risk in ``starting the clock'' on incrementconsumption and then allowing new sources to construct without determiningthe effect of these sources on the newly established increment. A Statecould discover in 1990 that it had unknowingly allowed increment exceedancesto occur in an area and would then be faced with developing a retrofitcontrol program to correct the exceedances. States have three main options:(1) Require all PSD permit applications to contain the nitrogen dioxideincrement analysis after the major source baseline date.(2) Require the increment analysis in permits submitted after the effectivedate of the regulation (12 months after promulgation).(3) Require the analysis only for PSD permits submitted after the nitrogendioxide program has been approved or is being implemented.The EPA would require States to adopt the third option as a minimum. Thiswould require the analysis only where the program is being implementedbecause, until that time, it is not mandatory that the analysis be utilizedby the reviewing agency under section 166. However, since all major sourceconstruction after the major source baseline date consumes increment, EPAwould strongly encourage States to require the analysis for informationalpurposes for applications submitted after the major source baseline date.In addition, sources and applicants should recognize the importance ofdetermining and retaining emissions and other data essential for calculatingincrement consumption. Also, it should be noted that applications for sourceswhich significantly impact areas where the nitrogen dioxide increment programis being implemented must include the increment analysis, even if the Statein which the source locates has not yet implemented the program.2. <T3>Increment Analysis. </T3>The basic components of a nitrogen dioxideincrement analysis are identical to the increment analyses for particulatematter and sulfur dioxide that are required under existing PSD regulations.This demonstration is based on dispersion modeling of incremental emissionsof nitrogen oxides in accordance with EPA's ``Guideline on Air QualityModels (Revised),'' July 1986. The nitrogen dioxide increment demonstrationdiffers from particulate matter and sulfur dioxide increment demonstrationsin the development of the emission inventory because of the importanceof mobile sources, and in the treatment of atmospheric transformationsof the pollutant in dispersion modeling.a. <T3>Emission Inventories. </T3>There are three main differences betweenthe emissions inventories for the particulate matter and sulfur dioxideincrements and the inventories that will be required for nitrogen oxides.First, regulatory agencies have generally not required PSD applicants toconsider mobile source emissions in increment analyses for particulatematter and sulfur dioxide in the past. However, unlike particulate matterand sulfur dioxide, and as discussed previously in the urban area analysis,mobile sources can greatly influence the amount of nitrogen dioxide incrementavailable in an area and must be considered. A large portion of nitrogenoxides emissions are from mobile and area sources that are not subjectto permit requirements and do not have ``allowable'' levels. The developmentof an emission inventory based only on permitted allowable emissions wouldnot reflect all of the emissions that must be accounted for in the implementationof the nitrogen dioxide increment. Further, many SIP's only specify allowablenitrogen oxides emission rates for certain source types.Second, the emission inventory requirements for the nitrogen dioxide incrementanalyses are different from those needed for particulate matter and sulfurdioxide. Inventories of actual emissions are essential for proper determinationof available nitrogen dioxide increment over time. The reason for thisdifference is that the proposed nitrogen dioxide increment is an annualaverage while the particulate matter and sulfur dioxide increments alsoinclude short-term averages. Short-term averages can often be modeled usingallowable emission rates, which are not appropriate for annual averagesbecause, under the guideline, annual averages assume continuous full loadoperation.If a retroactive baseline date is chosen, such as 1980, the determinationof the baseline inventory of actual nitrogen dioxide concentrations wouldbe further complicated because the inventory would have to be based onhistorical data (e.g., actual emissions for a prior year, such as 1980or 1983) which may not be readily available, rather than on contemporarydata (1988 and beyond). This problem would be aggravated if minor and areasources are included in the inventory. In addition, if a prior date (e.g.,1980) is chosen and actual emissions from minor and area sources are includedin the inventory, a few areas of the country could be in violation of theincrement when the nitrogen oxides PSD regulation takes effect (e.g., PrudhoeBay, Alaska). This violation would not necessarily be revealed througha case-by-case review of PSD permit applications alone and EPA anticipatesthat it would require States to examine areas which have experienced highgrowth since 1980 for possible increment exceedances. Exceedances of thenitrogen dioxide increment would, in turn, require revision of the SIPto remedy the existing exceedances and to prevent future exceedances.Third, the emissions inventories are typically in terms of total nitrogenoxides, while the proposed increment is in terms of nitrogen dioxide. Thisdistinction also relates to the dispersion modeling issues discussed below,since assumptions may have to be made about the ratio of nitrogen dioxideto total nitrogen oxides and the rate of conversion of nitrogen oxidesto nitrogen dioxide. Some sources may account for nitrogen dioxide emissionsexplicitly.b. <T3>Dispersion Modeling. </T3>Under the proposed rules, PSD applicantswill be required to calculate the increment consumed due to the constructionof major new or modified stationary sources, in conjunction with all otherapplicable emission increases and decreases. Increases caused by the proposednew source, as well as increases and decreases at other stationary sources,will generally be based on mathematical dispersion models. The EPA's ``Guidelineon Air Quality Models (Revised),'' July 1986, lists the recommended airquality modeling techniques for estimating air quality impacts of PSD sourcesand is incorporated by reference in 40 CFR 51.166 and 52.21.Due to the reactive nature of nitrogen oxides, assumptions regarding theconversion of nitrogen oxides to nitrogen dioxide are required when modeling,unless suitable photochemical models are used. Because of this limitation,the recommended modeling approach in the guideline for determining annualaverage concentrations of nitrogen dioxide is a three-tiered screeningprocedure. The initial screen is based on the use of an appropriate Gaussianmodel (from Appendix A of the guideline) and assumes total conversion ofnitrogen oxides to nitrogen dioxide. If the concentration determined bythis initial screen exceeds the increment, then the ozone limiting method(OLM) may be applied to account for a more realistic conversion rate ofnitrogen oxides to nitrogen dioxide. Application of the OLM using annualaverage ozone concentrations to ``limit'' the conversion of nitrogen oxidesto nitrogen dioxide constitutes the second-level screen, while use of theOLM on an hourly basis with hourly ozone data and hourly background nitrogendioxide is the third-level screen. More refined techniques may be consideredon a case-by-case basis, but should consider individual quantities of nitrogenoxides and nitrogen dioxide emissions, atmospheric transport and dispersion,and site-specific atmospheric transformation of nitrogen oxides to nitrogendioxide.The PSD applications submitted for major new sources and major modificationsafter the minor source baseline data has been triggered need to considerconsumption of the nitrogen dioxide increment by mobile sources. For modelingthe impact of mobile sources, a necessary first step is preparation ofthe emission inventory. Preliminary emission estimates should be made withthe MOBILE 4 model, soon to be released by EPA's Office of Mobile Sources.This model uses vehicle miles traveled and speed data (with default valuesassumed for other model inputs) for each major highway link. After theminor source baseline date has been triggered, future PSD applicants shoulddetermine emissions based on the average tons per year for the 2 yearsprior to the permit application. If these 2-year averaged emissions areless than the baseline concentration year emissions, then mobile sourceswill not consume nitrogen dioxide increment, but rather will expand theincrement available. In this case, mobile sources can conservatively beignored when calculating increment consumption.If mobile source emissions increase, however, the following approach issuggested to determine nitrogen dioxide increment expansion. For most urbanarea analyses, localized areas of high ambient nitrogen dioxide concentrationsneed not be considered, given the annual average basis of the increment(which tends to smooth concentration gradients). Consequently, mobile sourcescan be modeled as area sources, with grid squares on the order of 1 kilometeron a side. Uniform emissions should be assumed over the entire highwaylink. Mobile source emissions should be allocated to each area source gridsquare based on the portion of each highway link within each grid square.The area sources should be modeled consistent with the procedures recommendedin the guideline.If local areas of high ambient nitrogen dioxide concentrations are expected,then the modeling approach should be modified in the vicinity of theselocalized areas. The mobile source emissions in these areas should be modeledas line sources. Since the guideline does not contain a preferred long-termline source model (CALINE 3 applies only for short-term averages), oneof the available long-term guideline models should be used, such as theIndustrial Source Complex Long Term (ISCLT) model. A series of volume sourcesshould be used in ISCLT to approximate a line source for each highway segment.A greater spatial resolution in emissions is needed to ensure a more accurateconcentration estimate for such localized areas. The line source results(based on the inventory in the localized area of high ambient nitrogendioxide concentrations) should then be added to the area source results(based on the inventory for the remainder of the study area) at the samereceptor(s) for the same year(s) of meteorology. Since experience withthe ozone limiting method to account for nitrogen oxides to nitrogen dioxideconversion in the atmosphere has been limited, EPA will consider the needfor additional guidance on dispersion modeling for the nitrogen dioxideincrement prior to the efective date of the proposed regulation.c. <T3>Increment Violations and Enforcement. </T3>The adequacy of SIP regulationsand procedures for enforcement of the increment also becomes particularlyacute for a nitrogen dioxide increment. Currently, violations of PSD incrementsare addressed through revisions to the SIP. States are required by 40 CFR51.166(a)(4) to review the adequacy of SIP requirements periodically, orwithin 60 days of learning that an applicable increment is being violated.If the State or EPA determines that an applicable increment is being violated,the applicable SIP must be revised within 60 days (or later as prescribedby EPA) to correct the violation pursuant to the requirements of 40 CFR51.166(a)(3).A large portion of nitrogen oxides emissions are not regulated by Stateor local rules. Some of these unregulated emissions are from area sourcessuch as mobile sources and residential and commercial heating units. Othersare larger industrial sources for which no SIP regulations for nitrogenoxides emission rates have been developed. This means that, in contrastto particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, the existing SIP regulationshave little direct control over much of the nitrogen oxides emissions inan area.             To overcome this limitation, the procedures for compiling an inventoryof increment-consuming emissions based on actual emissions would need tobe included in revisions to SIP's presented to EPA for review. Similarly,procedures for detecting and addressing increment violations, particularlywith reference to minor and area sources, need to be developed in the SIPrevision process. The responsibility for developing these procedures restswith the State regulatory agencies. In the past, States have experienceddifficulty in incorporating actual emissions into their inventories. TheEPA is considering the need for guidance on the development of emissionsinventories for use by the State agencies in the PSD program.The EPA is specifically requesting comments on the impact of the selectionof a major source baseline date and a trigger date on the development ofinventories of actual emissions of nitrogen oxides. The EPA further requestscomment on the issues involved in addressing both future and retroactiveviolations of SIP requirements. This is particularly important relativeto options that are open to States to address violations of the incrementthat occur on the effective date of these regulations if a past baselinedate is promulgated.C. Alternative Implementation MethodsOn May 7, 1980, the EPA published an ANPR which gave notice of the Agency'sintent to develop PSD regulations for the remaining criteria pollutants,including nitrogen oxides (45 FR 30088). In the ANPR, 10 ``regulatory alternatives''were identified which EPA was then considering for incorporation into thePSD regulations for one or more of these pollutants. These alternativeswere: (1) The use of emission controls only, (2) the use of ambient airquality increments, (3) emission density zoning, (4) inventory management,(5) statewide emission limitations, (6) avoidance of co-located hydrocarbonand nitrogen oxides sources, (7) emission fees, (8) marketable permits,(9) de minimis levels, and (10) development of BACT for transportationsources. No further action was taken following the publication of thisnotice to develop these alternatives or to determine their potential formeeting the goals and purposes of the PSD program.With the initiation of this rulemaking, EPA determined that the appropriateformat for the nitrogen oxides PSD regulations is the development and useof ambient air quality increments. This format is similar to the systemalready in effect for particulate matter and sulfur dioxide. In developingthe increments for nitrogen dioxide, the EPA has tentatively concludedthat no other alternative protects air quality as effectively as a limiton ambient air concentration increases.In this respect, then, the EPA believes that 9 of the 10 ``regulatory alternatives''are, perhaps, more appropriately considered as potential methods, or surrogates,for implementing an ambient air quality increment, than as alternativeforms of a section 166 regulation itself.However, these other measures might be preferred by the States in formulatingplans for implementing its PSD program. Under Section 166, States may adoptstrategies other than increments for nitrogen oxides under Section 166if those strategies, taken as a whole, accomplish the purposes of thisprovision. In developing such programs, the State would be required todemonstrate that the implementation of such an alternative system wouldyield a program at least as effective as the program established by EPAthrough this rulemaking. Further, periodic review of the effectivenessof the alternative program would be required for the State to maintainthe program. The EPA is inclined to consider such alternatives as beingmore complicated than the basic approach of case-by-case modeling alreadyin use. However, it is possible that some combination (e.g., no modelingbelow a certain emission density, but modeling after that density is reached)may prove worthwhile, compared to case-by-case modeling for every source.Or, that a marketable permit approach might replace some of the cumbersomeadministrative process that are likely to accompany a ``first-come, first-served''approach and provide a more powerful financial incentive for the developmentof superior technologies. Therefore, EPA solicits comments on these implementationmeasures, on how their equivalence to the increment approach might be established,and on their potential role in State PSD programs.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Administrative Requirements</ITAG>A. Public HearingA public hearing will be held to discuss the proposed regulations in accordancewith section 307(d)(5) of the Act. Persons wishing to make oral presentationsshould contact EPA at the address given in the <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> section of this preamble. Oral presentations will belimited to 15 minutes each. Any member of the public may file a writtenstatement with EPA before, during, or within 30 days after the hearing.Written statements should be addressed to the Central Docket Section addressgiven in the <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>section of this preamble.A verbatim transcript of the hearing and written statements will be availablefor public inspection and copying during normal working hours at EPA'sCentral Docket Section in Washington, DC (see <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> section of this preamble).B. DocketThe docket for this regulatory action is A-87-16. The docket is an organizedand complete file of all the information submitted to or otherwise consideredby EPA in the development of this proposed rulemaking. The principal purposesof the docket are: (1) To allow interested parties to identify and locatedocuments so that they can effectively participate in the rulemaking process,and (2) to serve as the record in case of judicial review (except for interagencyreview materials [section 307(d)(7)(A)]). The docket is available for publicinspection at EPA's Central Docket Section, which is listed under the <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> section of this notice.C. Reference DocumentsAll the documents referenced in this preamble fall into one of two categories.They are either reference materials which are considered to be generallyavailable to the general public, or they are memoranda and reports preparedspecifically for this rulemaking. Both types of documents can be foundin docket number A-87-16.Documents which are classified as reference material are as follows:1. Air Quality Criteria for oxides of Nitrogen (EPA 600/8-82-026).2. Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised) (July 1986) and SupplementA (1987) (EPA 450/2-78-027R).3. Retention of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for NitrogenDioxide (50 FR 25536), June 19, 1985  4. Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: Prevention of Significant Deterioriationfor Hydrocarbons, Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Oxides, Ozone, and Lead (PSDSet II) (45 FR 30038), May 7, 1980  5. Memorandum of Opinion and Order, United States District Court, NorthernDistrict of California, No. C-86-0971-WWS, April 8, 1987  6. Industrial Source Complex (ISC) Dispersion Model Users Guide_2nd Edition(EPA 450/4-86-005)  The memoranda and reports that were prepared specifically for this rulemakingare contained in a 2-part document entitled ``Technical Support for NO<T2>x</T2> PSD Rule'' and placed in the docket. The following referencedreports are contained in Volume 1:  1. Model Plant Emission Reduction and Control Costs Impacts  2. Economic Impact Assessment of the Proposed NO<T2>2</T2> Increment Regulation  3. Urban Area Air Quality Impact Analysis  D. Office of Management and Budget Review  Under Executive Order 12291 (hereafer referred to as the Order), EPA mustjudge whether a regulation is ``major'' and, therefore, subject to therequirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. This proposed regulation isnot major because it would result in none of the adverse economic effectsset forth in Section 1 of the Order as grounds for finding a regulationto be major. The annualized costs in the fifth year after the proposedregulations would go into effect would be $63.7 million, less than the$100 milion established as the first criterion for a major regulation inthe Order. Estimated price increases of 0 to 3.7 percent associated withthe proposed regulations would not be considered a ``major increase incosts or prices'' specified as the second criterion in the Order. The economicanalysis of the proposed regulations' effect on the industry did not indicateany significant adverse effects on competition, investment, productivity,employment, innovation, or the ability of U.S. firms to compete with foreignfirms (the third criterion in the Order).  This regulation was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for review as required by Executive Order 12291. Any written comments fromOMB to EPA and any EPA responses to those comments will be included inDocket A-87-16.  The information collection requirements in this proposed regulation havebeen submitted for approval to OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of1980, 44 USC 3501 <T3>et. seq. </T3>Comments on these requirements should be submitted tothe Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, marked ``Attention,Desk Office for EPA,'' as well as to EPA. The final rule will respond toany OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements. E. Federalism Implications  Under Executive Order (Order) 12612, EPA must determine if a rule has federalismimplications. Federalism implications refers to substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. For those rules which have federalismimplications, a Federalism Assessment is to be made.  The Order also requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrainfrom limiting State policy options, consult with States prior to takingany actions that would restrict State policy options, and take such actionsonly when there is clear constitutional authority and the presence of aproblem of national scope. The Order provides for preemption of State lawhowever if there is a clear Congressional intent for the agency to do so.Any such preemption, however, is to be limited to the extent possible. The development of section 166 regulations for nitrogen dioxide is a statutory,non-discretionary duty. However, States may adopt strategies other thanincrements for NO<T2>x</T2> under section 166 if the strategies, taken as a whole, accomplishthe statutory purposes. In addition, the regulations that EPA is proposingwill allow States a full opportunity to develop their own approvable methodsof implementing the proposed increments. Finally, the EPA will implementits own increments regulations only for those States that do not developtheir own approvable regulations. Congressional intent for preemption ofState law is clear in such cases.  Unfortunately, because of the limited time allowed under the Court's orderfor the development of these increments, it was not possible to consultwith States prior to this proposal. However, State comments on the proposalwill be fully considered prior to promulgation of final rules. For thesereasons a Federalism Assessment has not been prepared.  F. Economic Impact Assessment  Section 317 of the Act requires the Administrator to prepare an economicimpact assessment for any regulations under Part C of Title I (relatingto PSD of air quality). An economic impact assessment was prepared forthe proposed PSD increments for nitrogen dioxide and for other alternativeincrements. The requirements of this section were considered in the formulationof the proposed increments to ensure that they would represent the bestsystem for the PSD of air quality, considering costs. The economic impactassessment is included in the docket.  G. Regulatory Flexibility Act Compliance  Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that thisrule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small business entities (see 46 FR 8709).  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects  </ITAG>40 CFR Part 51  Air pollution control, intergovernmental relations, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Nitrogen dioxide, State implementation plans.  40 CFR Part 52  Air pollution control, Nitrogen dioxide.  <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 2, 1988.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">A.
