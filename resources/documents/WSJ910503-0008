Is the city reliving the anguish of that 1963 tragedy?Debating once again whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone?Hardly. The question gripping Dallasites is something farless cerebral:</LP><TEXT>   Have you seen Kevin?   The Kevin in question is recent Oscar-winner KevinCostner, who is playing a New Orleans investigator in thefilm. And the arrival of this hottest of Hollywood starsseems to have sent this usually conservative city into a massswoon.   Breathless newspaper stories are reporting Kevinsightings. TV and radio stations join the search, even usingtraffic reporters. The Dallas Morning News Saturday societycolumn featured the startling news that the &quot;Dances withWolves&quot; director and actor was seen carrying a sleepingdaughter after dinner. In a feature story, a fan who met Mr.Costner gushed that &quot;he shook my hand in both of his.&quot;   The same edition also ran the third installment of &quot;KevinWatch,&quot; a column created for fans to report glimpses of thecelebrity. Among the calls to the Kevin hotline: A salesclerk's dizzying account of ringing up Mr. Costner's purchase(&quot;And I was like, oh, I'm touching his card&quot;), a sighting ofthe actor in a red Ferrari and a report that Mr. Costner wasseen &quot;attempting to strangle the person responsible for thecolumn.&quot;   An earlier column placed the actor at the Waffle House at9:30 one morning, at the Black-Eyed Pea restaurant at 10 andat a pizza eatery at 11:30. If that's true, he was probablyin a hospital by noon.   Victoria Loe, the News's life-styles editor, said thepaper has received hundreds of responses on the hot line,including quite a few in jest. &quot;This was a quick way to tapinto the talk on the street,&quot; she says.   And on the street, Carol Luker, a bank vice president, andthree friends were among about 80 stargazers who spent partof their lunch hour staring at a beige trailer where theactor reportedly was dressing. Earlier, they had beenwatching the filming from their 66th-floor office where &quot;weall have our binoculars,&quot; Ms. Luker says. &quot;I'd say the wholebuilding is leaning over to one side.&quot;   The vigil paid off. Just before noon, Mr. Costner emergedfrom the trailer, smiled and hopped into a waiting van.</TEXT></DOC>
