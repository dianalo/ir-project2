A spate of conditional acquisition proposals in the past year has confounded Wall Street arbitragers, who have lost money betting on &quot;bids&quot; proposed -- but never formally made -- for such companies as USX Corp., Lucky Stores Inc. and Borg-Warner Corp.    Here is an example of what happens:    Last Nov. 25, Borg-Warner directors received a letter from Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs, who together with Minstar Inc. controlled 7.7% of the plastics, car parts and chemicals concern and proposed to buy the rest for $43 to $48 a share.    Although the figures he used were quite specific, Mr. Jacobs said he wanted to see the books before negotiating a friendly acquisition. Even though his letter didn't constitute a formal offer, it was referred to in news stories as a &quot;bid&quot; or an &quot;offer,&quot; and the stock rose $1.375, to $39, in response.    But the gulf between the stock price and the figures cited by Mr. Jacobs reflected skepticism that such a bid would really arrive. The letter was viewed as a move to hasten a restructuring, or to spark a bid by another Borg holder, GAF Corp.    Since then the company largely has ignored Mr. Jacobs, who threatened a hostile tender offer Feb. 19, and the stock has lagged behind the market.    Such tactics are &quot;in vogue,&quot; because they are &quot;a cost efficient way of stirring up the stew,&quot; said Arthur Fleischer, a merger lawyer at Fried Frank Harris Shriver andamp; Jacobson.    &quot;What is a postage stamp, 22 cents?&quot; he said. &quot;You can cause a lot of consequences to a company by simply sending a letter. Basically, you may -- but not necessarily -- put the company in play,&quot; he said.    Lawrence Schloss, a mergers executive at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette, said of those who make the proposals: &quot;Some are your basic greenmail artists. Some are bona fide buyers who see value but really don't have the appropriate information to make an offer. And some are a combination of the two.&quot;    In an interview, Mr. Jacobs said he didn't write the letter merely to stir the stew or put Borg-Warner in play, and said the company has agreed to talk to him. &quot;Don't assume nothing is happening. Don't assume we're just sitting here waiting for the phone to ring,&quot; he added.    But he acknowledged that disclosure of a proposal may put pressure on a company to deal with a suitor. &quot;I think people who are running certain companies pay more attention to what Wall Street says sometimes. And if no one knows anything, then there's no pressure (for the company) to say anything.&quot;    In a typical pattern, an investor will buy a 5% stake, try to get arbitragers to buy shares, and then make a bid &quot;proposal&quot; to focus attention on the potential values. Mr. Schloss said that target companies must usually hire investment bankers to evaluate the proposal. &quot;They have a fiduciary obligation to see if it's real and then respond.&quot;    Once in play, the target company may negotiate with the &quot;bidder,&quot; seek a rescuing suitor, or execute a restructuring to boost the stock price. Plenty of takeover attempts turn into mergers or leveraged buyouts through just such a process.    &quot;Maybe it's a way of starting talks with management. It works if you can find weak management that perceives itself as weak,&quot; said Juliusz Sas, a special situations analyst at the brokerage house Balis Zorn Gerard Inc. who has followed the Borg-Warner siege. &quot;It's like pointing at them with an unloaded gun.&quot;    But for the corporate raider forced to pull the trigger in such a circumstance, the results can be an embarrassing &quot;click.&quot; That's what happened at the denouement of Asher Edelman's pursuit of Lucky Stores, a California grocery chain.    Mr. Edelman's pursuit of Lucky had all the twists and turns of a Gothic novel. After accumulating a reported 3% stake, he proposed a $35-a-share friendly purchase in a letter disclosed Sept. 24. He demanded that any restructuring be &quot;prompt and efficient. Lip service will not satisfy me.&quot;    After company officials refused to meet Mr. Edelman, Lucky stock peaked at $37.875 in early October on reports that the investor was ready to launch a hostile tender offer. But he didn't follow through on that threat after Lucky formally rejected the proposal Oct. 6 and began a defensive restructuring and stock buyback.    The investor then raised his proposed bid to $37 a share. Lucky rejected it again. Mr. Edelman dropped his proposal, then renewed it again Nov. 19 after buying more shares. But after holders approved the restructuring in late December, the stock fell to $26.    (Mr. Edelman was more determined in his pursuit of Ponderosa Inc. He disclosed a 19% stake in late November, and without further preliminaries, launched a tender offer Dec. 2 that, after some sweetening, snared the company.)    Two weeks ago, Mr. Edelman reached a three-year standstill agreement limiting his Lucky stake to 5% and barring him from attempting to gain control. Lucky paid him just $2.8 million to cover expenses.    Although Lucky shares have rebounded to $31.875, they have lagged behind the market since the takeover attempt, and some arbitragers are bitter. &quot;As far as I'm concerned, he sold his credibility for $2.8 million,&quot; said one.    Mr. Edelman was out of the country this week and couldn't be reached for comment. His lawyer, Burton Lehman of Schulte Roth andamp; Zabel, said that while Mr. Edelman's proposals &quot;weren't bids in the nature of a tender offer, they were serious bids seeking to work out a basis to purchase the company. But the company rejected each of them and went ahead and did its restructuring.&quot;    Perhaps the most prominent &quot;non-bid&quot; bid was Carl Icahn's run on USX. Mr. Icahn and several other corporate raiders had taken positions in the depressed stock. On Oct. 6, he proposed a &quot;friendly&quot; $31-a-share acquisition, subject to a look at the books, but threatened a hostile tender if the company didn't accept or undertake a &quot;radical&quot; restructuring.    One prominent merger lawyer said arbitragers erroneously &quot;treated Icahn's conditional approach to U.S. Steel as an unconditional bid. It wasn't a bid. He said he would make a bid 'if-if-if.' But the Street treated them as a company that was in play.&quot;    Mr. Icahn and USX management soon became embroiled in a lengthy effort to agree on conditions under which the investor could look at the books. Then the insider-trading scandals that broke in mid-November tainted his investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert, putting in doubt some raiders' ability to get financing and leaving Mr. Icahn stuck in USX. The stock fell to 20 before rebounding on higher oil prices. In January, he abandoned the effort, but still owns the stock.    This month, Mr. Icahn and his Trans World Airlines made a proposal for a bid that got set aside before it was ever made. TWA bought 15% of USAir Group stock and suggested it might bid $52 a share for the whole company after USAir made a bid to acquire Piedmont Aviation.    The Icahn move was widely interpreted as an effort to foil a combination that stood to rob him of two choice candidates to merge with -- or, preferably, buy -- TWA. But USAir rejected the bid as &quot;highly conditional,&quot; among other things. After a federal judge blocked further purchases and Piedmont agreed to merge with USAir, Mr. Icahn said he wouldn't seek control for the moment.    Many bona fide tender offers are contingent on the target company dropping anti-takeover provisions, including a bid this week by AFG Industries and Wagner andamp; Brown for GenCorp. Takeover experts said it is also legitimate for would-be acquirers to want to see a company's books.    But last summer, Wagner andamp; Brown made a proposal for a bid that never went through. Wagner andamp; Brown suggested paying $50 a share for Panhandle Eastern Corp. last June 30, and the stock initially surged near that price.    But Panhandle soon rejected the bid and took a $460 million charge to settle a dispute with Algeria. Terms included what amounted to an anti-takeover provision giving the Algerians the right to sell Panhandle stock back to the company at an above-market price. The stock sank to $40 following those moves, as investors began to fear Wagner andamp; Brown wouldn't really make a bid.    Possibly fearing another takeover move, Panhandle then spun off its most attractive asset, Anadarko Petroleum Corp., and the two stocks combined eventually rose well above the $50 figure.    A proposed bid in the oil patch that never actually materialized came from Canada's Belzberg family for Ashland Oil Inc. a year ago. The Belzbergs said they were prepared to pay $60 a share, but later accepted $51 a share from the company for their 9.2% stake.    Skeptics are already wondering about a proposal Feb. 23 from Columbia Ventures, a Miami-based partnership that said it might pay $19 a share for Harnischfeger Industries Inc. The stock, which initially ran up to $18.25 on the news, has since retreated to $17.625.    Of course, how a company treats a proposal varies according to the proposer's identity. Mr. Schloss of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette said if it's, say, Texaco Inc., directors have to consider it seriously. But, as Borg-Warner observed last month: &quot;We do not consider letters from Mr. Jacobs as formal offers or legally binding.&quot;    In deciding how to value a target company's stock, arbitragers go through a similar thought process. Even though they have all taken greenmail in the past, Messrs. Icahn and Jacobs and Canada's Belzbergs have gained credibility by actually buying companies on occasion.    However, one takeover speculator focuses on the target company instead of on the proposer. &quot;It doesn't matter whether the bidder is serious,&quot; says this arbitrager. &quot;You look to see whether the target is going to care. Just look at the board of directors. People who are from the Boy Scouts of America&quot; aren't likely to put up as much resistance as &quot;someone whose name is on the company.&quot;    ---           How Some Highly Conditional 'Bids' Fared                   Stock's       'Bid'*      Initial       Date**      Reaction***       Outcome    Bidder (Target Company)    TWA/Carl Icahn (USAir Group)       $52         +5 3/8 to 49 1/8  Bid, seen a ploy to get       3/4/87                        USAir to buy TWA, is                                     shelved Monday with                                     USAir at 45 1/4; closed                                     Wed. at 44 1/2    Columbia Ventures (Harnischfeger)       $19         +1/2 to 18 1/4    Harnischfeger rejects       2/23/87                       bid Feb. 26 with stock                                     at 18 3/8; closed Wed.                                     at 17 5/8    Irwin Jacobs (Borg-Warner)       $43-$48     +1/38 to 39       Borg-Warner ignores       11/25/86                      Jacobs; stock lags                                     market, closed Wed. at                                     41 1/4    Carl Icahn (USX)       $31         +1 1/8 to 27 5/8  'Bid' expires Oct. 22       10/6/86                       and stock later falls                                     to 20; closed Wed. at                                     27 7/8    Asher Edelman (Lucky Stores)       $35         +1 3/4 to 36      Lucky rejects bid and       9/24/86                       restructures; stock                                     slumps to 26;                                     standstill pact reached                                     March 6; closed Wed.                                     at 31 1/2    Belzberg family (Ashland Oil)       $60         +2 5/8 to 54 5/8  Bid 'deadline' passes,       3/26/86                       Ashland buys back                                     Belzberg stake at 51;                                     stock slips below 47,                                     rebounds to 63 1/8 Wed.    *Per share    **Announced or disclosed    ***On first trading day bid was known</TEXT></DOC>
