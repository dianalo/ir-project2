Based on a computer software program known as APACHE III,the system enables doctors to compare one patient's conditionagainst the experience of thousands of others and calculatethe odds of the patient's leaving the hospital alive.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The majority of doctors tell you that statistics don'tapply to individual patients,&quot; says William A. Knaus,director of the ICU Research Unit, George WashingtonUniversity Medical Center, in Washington. &quot;That's what we'redirectly challenging here.&quot; Dr. Knaus is the principal authorof a paper describing the system and its implications,published today in the journal Science.   Such a system, if accepted, could have a broad impact ondecisions regarding treatment of the desperately ill,particularly the use of expensive procedures that often dolittle more than eke out an extra week or month of life. Theability to calculate a patient's chances of dying could leadto attempts to discourage use of treatments with littlebenefit and redirect resources toward those treatments withmore promise or toward financing care for the poor oruninsured.   &quot;Modern life-sustaining therapy often succeeds inpostponing death, but may be ineffective at restoringhealth,&quot; say Dr. Knaus and his colleagues Douglas P. Wagnerand Joanne Lynn. About 28% of outlays for the U.S. Medicareprogram for the elderly go to provide care during the lastsix months of life, the researchers say.   Physicians generally use a combination of medicalindicators and past experience to make a subjective judgmentof a patient's prospects for survival. While these judgmentsare quite accurate in predicting those at very high risk orlow risk of dying, Dr. Knaus found that the APACHE-basedsystem &quot;is more accurate overall&quot; in predicting mortalitythan the most experienced physicians. The system is marketedby Apache Medical System Inc., a closely held company inWashington.   For instance, the researchers compared the subjectiveestimates doctors made among a group of 850 patients within24 hours of their admission to intensive care units. Thedoctors predicted 25.5% would die in the hospital, whereasthe computer system predicted 19.7% would die. The computerprediction was within a fraction of the 20.7% that actuallydid die, the report said.   The physicians identified 46 patients as having a 90% riskof dying, but only 62% died; of the 16 patients the systemrated as having a 90% chance of dying in the hospital, alldied.   Dr. Knaus said the best results would be obtained when thesystem is used in conjunction with a doctor's judgment. &quot;Thisisn't to be used alone,&quot; he said.   The system decribed in the Science article relates just tointensive care patients, and predicts only whether they willsurvive the hospital stay. Eventually, such systems should beable to predict longer-term survival as well as whetherpatients are likely to live not only longer, but better,lives, Dr. Knaus said.   The research was supported by the U.S. Agency for HealthCare Policy and Research.</TEXT></DOC>
