(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The elderly owner of a 17th-centuryplantation said to be the site of the first Thanksgiving is tryingto save it from being sold off in parts because of onerousinheritance taxes.   ``I feel like we're caretakers of the place for the public,''said Malcolm Jamieson, who has spent much of his life restoringBerkeley Plantation's bare grounds and its manor to their originalsplendor.   The plantation, which sits along the James River betweenRichmond and Williamsburg, has a rich history.   The first Thanksgiving in the Colonies was celebrated atBerkeley on Dec. 4, 1619, more than a year before the Pilgrims hadtheir better-known Thanksgiving dinner in what is now Plymouth,Mass., according to ``The Great Plantation'' by Virginia historianClifford Dowdey.   The mansion was built in 1726. William Henry Harrison, the ninthpresident of the United States, was born there. George Washingtonand the nine presidents who followed him dined at Berkeley.   The first bourbon was distilled at the plantation, ``Taps'' wascomposed there, and President Lincoln reviewed troops there duringthe Civil War, according to ``The Great Plantation.''   ``The tourists are saving it,'' Jamieson said. ``If it weren'tfor the tourists, we couldn't keep these places on (our) outsideincome.''   Jamieson estimated that 50,000 people visit Berkeley annually.Adults pay a $7 admission fee and children pay $3.50.   Jamieson said the money from tourists may not be enough when hedies. He estimated inheritance taxes on the house and a little morethan 1,000 acres at nearly $1 million.   Jamieson, who gives his age as over 80, said that after years ofresearch he has not found a way around the tax problem.   He already has prepared building sites in the woods should hisson need to sell part of the land. He said he has been offered$100,000 for four acres along the James River.   ``There's too much American history here to cut it up,'' saidJamieson, who feels that inheritance taxes should be deferred forproperties like Berkeley that are open to the public and are on theNational Register of Historic Landmarks.   The idea is an old one but a good one, said Carl Nelson,spokesman for the National Trust for Historic Preservation inWashington.   ``It's an idea that really needs to be looked at closely,'' hesaid.   The six-month property tax bill, about $600 in 1926 whenJamieson inherited part of the plantation and bought the rest fromhis relatives, has grown to about $16,000, Jamieson said.   Jamieson's father, John, bought the house and surrounding acresin 1905. The Jamiesons opened the house to the public in 1938.   Admissions money is used to maintain the house and grounds. TheJamiesons live from revenue from the farm and nursery on theproperty. Jamieson, his son, Jamie, and six others run the farm andact as guides.   Jamieson has planted trees and shrubbery, and restored theoriginal five terraces leading down to the river. He and his songrow boxwoods, which they sell Busch Gardens amusement park, priceydevelopments on the James River near Williamsburg and others.   The hard work has pushed up the value of his property, whichtoday has an estimated worth of $2 million to $3 million, accordingto Jamieson.   Jamieson said he has asked U.S. Rep Herbert Bateman, R-Va., forhelp with his proposal for deferred estate taxes.   Bateman said he is drafting legislation to address Jamieson'sconcerns.   ``I think he has a very legitimate concern,'' Bateman said. ``Iam sympathetic. ... The tradeoff is better assurance that historicproperties at the death of the owner remain open and available tothe public as historic properties they can see and touch andexperience.''</TEXT></DOC>
