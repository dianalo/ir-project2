Brizendine, president of Lockheed's Aeronautical SystemsCo., said in an editorial in the company's employee newsletterpublished Thursday.   Seventy-five employees at the company's Burbank plant have filedsuit against Lockheed and firms making and supplying variouschemicals believed to used in making the fighter.   About 150 employees have filed worker's compensation claimscharging they suffer from illnesses caused by dangerous chemicals.   Lockheed workers claim composite materials used in the Stealthfighter, designed not to reflect radar, and chemicals used to millor clean them are causing rashes, nausea, dizziness, memory lossand lack of concentration, according to Rep. Howard Berman,D-Calif., whose district includes Burbank.   Inspectors from the federal Occupational Health and SafetyAdministration and the Pentagon announced last week they wereinspecting Lockheed's facilities, but they have declined to commenton what they have found.   The employees have said security provisions forbidding them fromdiscussing their work with outsiders have hampered them fromseeking treatment from private physicians.   However, Brizendine said employees could seek help from privatedoctors and show doctors company lists of chemicals they use.</TEXT></DOC>
