The rock avalanche originated on the flankof a historically active volcano. The initial basal sliding surface (whoseslope was 25{sup 0}) was in weathered rhyolitic tuff. The soil flowshad volumes as great as 5 x 10{sup 5} m{sup 3} and occurred in unconsolidatedto weakly cemented colluvium and alluvium, weathered rhyolitic tuff,and ash. Liquefaction of saturated, unconsolidated ash deposits thatare hydraulically confined by impermeable, weathered rhyolitic tuff mayhave triggered two of the soil flows. One of the flows was reported byan eyewitness to have attained speeds of 20 to 60 kph; another destroyedhouses and killed 13 people. The extreme runnout distance of the rockavalanche and the fact that all of the deaths in the earthquake werefrom landslides point of the hazards posed by these types of destructivelandslides. The presence of volcanic layers subparallel to surface slopesand interbedded with highly altered layers indicates that the geologicconditions under which the rock avalanche and soil flows occurred aresimilar to conditions which produced similar landslides in other historicalearthquakes. The occurrence of these landslides emphasizes the fact thatsimilar hazards may exist in volcanic and seismically active areas inthe western US (such as the Cascade Range), even without the presenceof active volcanism.</TEXT></DOC>
