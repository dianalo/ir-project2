Waters, both atM.I.T.andP;  Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, describes how an automatedsoftware-development tool can increase a programmer's productivity.andP;  Thebook, a selection in the ACM Press Books Frontier Series, describes the&quot;Programmer's Apprentice,&quot; an M.I.T.-based tool known as an &quot;intelligentassistant for programmers&quot; which shows the reader how to use knowledge-basedtechniques to develop computer aids for software engineering (CASE).andP;  Thebook is 250 pages and is available to members at $31.95.andP;  All others: $35.50.andO;Order number: 704906.andM;A VITAL NEW TECHNIQUE FOR YOUR CS TOOLBOXandM;In Performance Instrumentation and Visualization, eminent designers andresearchers exchange ideas on visualization, a powerful new techniqueenabling the reader to observe their simulations and measurements.andP;  The bookclarifies features of performance instrumentation, determines whichtechniques apply to measurement, and forecasts the role of visualization inevaluating tomorrow's supercomputers.andP;  Edited by Rebecca Koskela and MargaretSimmons, both at Los Alamos National Laboratory.andP;  The book is 300 pages andavailable to members at $38.95.andP;  All others: $43.25.andP;  Order number: 704908.andM;Members can save postage and handling charges by paying for ACM Press Booksby check.andM;NEW ACM PRESS PROCEEDINGSandM;This month there are six recently published proceedings to announce:andM;* 17th Annual ACM Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages SanFrancisco, CA, January 17-19, 1990andM;Sponsored by ACM SIGACT andamp; ACM SIGPLANandM;Pages: 408 Members: $22.00 All others: $30.00.andP;  Order number: 549900andM;Not include in any SIG newsletter subscription.andP;  Must be ordered separately.andM;* International Workshop on Software Configuration Management Princeton, NJ,October 24, 1989 Sponsored by SIGSOFT, IEEE-CS, and Gesellschart furInformatikandM;Pages: 428 Members: $13.00 All others: $17.00 Order number: 594891andM;Simultaneously published as Software Engineering Notes, Vol.andP;  17/7.andM;* Supercomputing '89 Reno, NV, November 13-17, 1989 Sponsored by SIGARCH andamp;IEEE-CSandM;Pages: 844 Members: $43.00 All others: $57.00 Order number: 415892andM;Not included in any SIG newsletter subscription.andP;  Must be ordered separately.andM;* ACM SIGSOFT '89: Third Symposium on Software Testing, Analysis, andVerfication (TAV3) Key West, FL, December 13-15, 1989 Sponsored by SIGSOFTandM;Pages: 230 Members: $15.00 All others: $20.00 Order number: 594892andM;Simultaneously published as Software Engineering Notes, Vol 14/8.andM;* WSC '89: 1989 Winter Simulation Conference Washington, DC, December 4-6,1989 Sponsored by AMS, SIGSIM, IEEE-CS, IEEE Systems, Man, CyberneticsSociety, IEE, NIST, ORSA, and IMS/ACSandM;Pages: 1139 Members: $60.00 All others: 95.00 Order number: 578890andM;Not included in any SIG newsletter subscription.andP;  Must be ordered separately.andM;* 10th International Conference on Information Systems Boston, MA, December4-6, 1989 Sponsored by SIMCIS, IMS in cooperation with SIGBDP and TechnicalCommittee #8, and IFIPandM;Pages: 428 Members: $45.00 All others: $51.00 Order number: 406890andM;Not included in any SIG newsletter subscription.andP;  Must be ordered separately.andM;ACM members can order all the publications and products described above bycalling toll-free: 1-800-342-6626 (outside USA and in Alaska and Maryland,call 1-301-528-4261).andM;Please use the chart below to figure the cost of postage and handling.andP;  Ifpurchasing an ACM Press Book (collaborative venture with Addison-Wesley),members can save the postage and handling costs by paying by check.andP;  However,postage and handling for all other proceedings and electronic products mustbe included.andM;Shipping and handling on orders totalling:andM;$1.00 to $20.00 ($3.00)/$20.01 to $30.00 ($4.00)/$30.01 to $40.00($5.00)/$40.01 to $60.00 ($6.00)/$60.01 to $100.00 ($7.00)/$100.01 to $500.00($8.00)/$500.01 to $1,000.00 ($10.00)/$1,000.01 and over ($15.00).andM;Remember, you save postage and handling if you prepay, by check, your ordersfor ACM Press Books--only those books collaboratively published withAddison-Wesley.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
