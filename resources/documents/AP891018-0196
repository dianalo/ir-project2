The Federal Railroad Administration has previously had noauthority to remove private railroad employees. It gained theauthority to assess civil penalties in July 1988.   The new rule, to take effect in 30 days, follows the Rail SafetyImprovement Act of 1988.   Employees who face suspension or permanent disqualification bythe agency will be notified and may face a hearing, the agencysaid. Any disqualification order would be disseminated throughoutthe rail industry.   FRA Administrator Gil Carmichael said the new regulation shouldlead to ``a new level of respect for the rail safety rules andregulations.''   ``Our only goal is to improve safety,'' he said, ``and ifenforcement action against individuals is the best way to deal witha serious safety situation, we will act fairly, but firmly.''   The orders apply to supervisors as well as employees who operatetrains, issue orders to trains, conduct training or inspect orrepair locomotives, cars, tracks or signals.</TEXT></DOC>
