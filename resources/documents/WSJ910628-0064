It gotneither.   In the term that ended yesterday, the justices ruled, 6-3,that employers can't adopt fetal-protection policies thatkeep women of childbearing age out of jobs that may behazardous to their fetuses. The justices also ruled, 7-1,that the Constitution doesn't require a single set of uniformstandards to limit the size of punitive damages awards byjuries.</LP><TEXT>   Both decisions served to remind the business communitythat a conservative Supreme Court isn't synonymous with apro-business court.   &quot;My consistent feeling about this court is that it isn't apro-business court,&quot; says Geoffrey Miller, a professor at theUniversity of Chicago Law School. &quot;This is a court thatattempts to implement what it perceives as the intent oflegislators, federal or state, and it's quite willing to doso even if that leads to an anti-business decision,&quot; hecontends. &quot;That's a conservative position; it's not apro-business position.&quot;   Business groups were especially unhappy with the ruling onfetal-protection policies because it left employers uncertainabout how to protect pregnant women on jobs that could exposethem to high lead levels or that could pose other hazards.Women's rights groups said the answer is to make theworkplace safer for everyone, but business groups say thatcan be prohibitively expensive.   Business groups were unhappy that the court didn't takeseriously a potential for lawsuits by children who sufferedinjuries from workplace exposure while in their mothers'wombs. The Supreme Court &quot;summarily dismissed thoseconcerns,&quot; contends Mona Zeiberg, a lawyer with the U.S.Chamber of Commerce National Litigation Center.   The punitive damages ruling also was a blow, although itwon't deter corporate defense lawyers from continuing toargue that some jury awards are unconstitutional, eitherbecause they were made without standards to guide the jury orbecause the amount of punitive damages was out of proportionto the harm done.   Punitive damages are awarded in civil cases as punishmentor to deter a defendant's conduct; they are distinct fromcompensatory damages, which are meant to reimburse aplaintiff's loss or injury.   The ruling was the culmination of an unsuccessful campaignby a handful of lawyers and companies to limit what theyclaim is the growing number and size of punitive damageawards by juries. Consumer groups argue such awards arenecessary to induce companies to make safer products.   The most significant development of the court's term, notlimited to business interests, was the emergence of aconservative voting bloc of Chief Justice William Rehnquistand Justices Byron White, Sandra O'Connor, Antonin Scalia,Anthony Kennedy and David Souter. This coalition is lessfragile and less susceptible to defections than if it was amajority of five. And Justice Thurgood Marshall'sannouncement of his retirement yesterday will solidify theconservative voting bloc even more and may make the courtdominated by a 7-2 bloc.   Until this term, the court's liberal wing gained some 5-4decisions. Even this term there were a few, but they arebecoming harder to get.   &quot;With the retirement of Justice Brennan, the strugglebetween liberals and conservatives on the Supreme Court isover,&quot; says Louis Michael Seidman, a Georgetown UniversityLaw School professor.   Another notable factor about the term was that it producedthe fewest decisions -- 112 -- since 1970. That figure isdown from a high of 151 in both 1982 and 1983, and it is 17less than last year. The justices haven't discussed thisdecline publicly, but privately they insist there isn't aconcerted effort to cut their workload.   The 112 decisions were selected from more than 5,400appeals filed in the high court. As in the past few years,the number of cases filed by prisoners and others whocouldn't afford to pay the $300 filing fee increased from2,885 last term to more than 3,450 this term. The number ofcases filed with the fee paid, including almost all businesscases, hovered around 2,000, down from 2,032 last term.   What follows is a summary of the major rulings of the1990-91 term. The case names and votes are included inparentheses. The court will release a final list today ofcases that the justices agreed to hear or refused to reviewwhen their new term begins Oct. 7.
