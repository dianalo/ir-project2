Reagan's announcement Friday that he would disregard theconditions drew an angry response from Senate Majority LeaderRobert C. Byrd and Sen. Sam Nunn. The two lawmakers said thepresident accepted the language when he and Soviet leader MikhailS. Gorbachev exchanged the instruments of ratification at theMoscow summit.   But Reagan said his objections should not have any practicaleffect on carrying out the treaty, and that any questions aboutinterpretation should be able to be resolved ``in a spirit ofmutual accommodation and respect.''   Reagan said he was stating his objections to protect theconstitutional powers and responsibilities of the president.   The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty provides for theelimination within three years of all nuclear missiles with a rangeof 300 miles to 3,400 miles.   At issue is an amendment attached by the Senate to theresolution of ratification that bars future administrations fromchanging the U.S. interpretation of the treaty without prior Senateapproval. The Senate ratified the treaty May 27.   The Democratic-sponsored measure arose from a fight with Reaganover his interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.The administration had claimed that the longstanding interpretationof the ABM agreement was too narrow, and should be broadened toallow realistic tests of components of the administration's StarWars antimissile system.   Reagan spelled out his concern in a written statement issued atthe White House after he departed for a weekend at Camp David. Hesaid the Senate-passed provision ``apparently seeks to alter thelaw of treaty interpretation.''   He said the measure would give primary weight to executivebranch statements to the Senate, above other sources whichinternational forums and U.S. courts would consider in interpretingtreaties.   ``It subordinates fundamental and essential treatyinterpretative sources such as the treaty parties' intent, thetreaty negotiating record and the parties' subsequent practices,''Reagan said.   He said the administration ``does not take the position that theexecutive branch can disregard authoritative executive statementsto the Senate, and we have no intention of changing theinterpretation of the INF treaty which was presented to the Senate....   ``Nonetheless, the principles of treaty interpretationrecognized and repeatedly invoked by the courts may not be limitedor changed by the Senate alone, and those principles will governany future disputes over interpretation of the treaty,'' Reagansaid.   Byrd, D-W.Va., countered: ``The issue is whether any presidentmay subsequently reinterpret treaty provisions in ways contrary tothe shared understanding between the executive and the Senate atthe time the Senate gave its consent.   ``The president accepted the condition when he exchanged theinstruments of ratification,'' Byrd said.   Nunn, a Georgia Democrat who was involved in crafting therestrictions, also objected to the president's statement, saying,``The treaty, including this conition, is now the supreme law ofthe land, and the president can no more change it with a letterthan he can change any other law with a letter.''   The INF treaty, approved on a vote of 93-5, will require thatthe Soviets destroy 1,752 missiles while the United Stateseliminates 867, including both deployed and non-deployed weapons.   In addition, the treaty includes the most intrusive andstringent verification procedures in arms control history. The keyverification feature provides on-site inspection, both on a regularbasis and through challenges by each side.</TEXT></DOC>
