An estimated 4,000 students boycotted classes and many foughtrunning battles with baton-wielding riot squads, a studentspokesman said.   Stones were thrown at police, and the windows of a limousineused by the Zimbabwe University vice chancellor, Professor WalterKamba, were smashed by rioters, said the spokesman who requestedanonymity.   Sporadic clashes continued throughout the day, and thesemi-official Zimbabwe Inter African News Agency said more than 50protesters were arrested.   It was not clear whether students were injured.   Deputy Police Commissioner Douglas Chingoka was quoted as sayingthat the unrest was ``very well under control.''   The news agency said university officials were scheduled to meetwith President Robert Mugabe to discuss the student protests.   In a leaflet distributed before the start of classes today,student leaders called for a meeting on campus to discuss thearrests today of student council members Arthur Mutambara and EnockChikweche.   The leaflet said police surrounded and stormed a campusresidence and Mutambara was ``profusely bleeding'' after jumpingfrom a second-floor window in an effort to escape from police whobroke down the door of his bedroom.   ``The notorious riot police have struck,'' said the leaflet. Itdescribed student action in response as ``a matter of life anddeath.''   Student leaders said they believed Mutambara's arrest wasprompted by a statement he issued Oct. 2 criticizing the governmentand university authorities.   That statement said police banned a student meeting scheduledfor Sept. 29 to mark the first anniversary of a studentdemonstration organized in 1988 to protest official corruption.   In the past year, college students have staged severaldemonstrations in which they accused the government of stiflingfree expression and curbing academic freedoms.   Education minister Fay Chung labeled students ``hooligans anddrunkards'' and said they were being manipulated by politicalopponents to attack the government.</TEXT></DOC>
