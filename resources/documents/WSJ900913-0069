The little-known talks came to light when MikhailGorbachev was asked by Soviet television what else he andPresident Bush discussed, besides the Persian Gulf, at theHelsinki summit last Sunday. The Soviet president mentionedthe airplane venture.</LP><TEXT>   The planned project involves two Soviet aircraft designbureaus, Ilyushin and Tupolev, Israel Aircraft IndustriesLtd., and the Pratt andamp; Whitney unit of United TechnologiesCorp. The point man for this unlikely team is none other thanthe original Russia hand, Armand Hammer, the 92-year-oldchairman and chief executive of Occidental Petroleum Corp.   The plan is to take four-engined Ilyushin Il-96s andtwin-engined Tupolev Tu204s to Tel Aviv, where the Israeliaerospace concern would outfit them with Pratt andamp; Whitneyengines, U.S. avionic systems and comfortable cabininteriors. The planes then would be offered for saleworld-wide as cheaper alternatives to Airbus Industrie andBoeing Co. aircraft.   In a telephone interview yesterday, Dr. Hammer said hewould travel to Moscow next month and hopes to get a firmcontract from President Gorbachev so that a new company hechairs, Aviation Venture International, can buy the Sovietairplanes for refitting in Israel and export to the West. &quot;Ihave written Mr. Gorbachev about it and I have hadencouraging replies,&quot; he said.   Dr. Hammer also said he met with President Bush threeweeks ago and discussed the plan. The president's reactionwas &quot;very favorable,&quot; he said.   These refitted-for-export jetliners, which are intended tocompete with the best that Airbus can build, would offerairlines an alternative to the three big Westernmanufacturers -- Airbus, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas Corp.-- which are nearly sold out for the next several years, Dr.Hammer said. They could be flying by 1995 and would cost lessthan competing Western models because of lower Soviet andIsraeli labor costs, he said.   However, big problems could lie ahead. Aeroflot, theSoviet Union's mammoth airline, itself needs nearly all ofthe early production of both new models. Westerntechnology-transfer authorities may balk at letting sensitiveavionic systems go into Soviet-built airplanes. Aviationspecialists say the refitted planes would have to wincertification from exacting U.S. and European air-worthinessauthorities, a potentially large stumbling block. Finally,they ask, who would supply after-sales support to airlinesthat bought the planes?   Israel Aircraft Industries is keeping mum on the subject.A spokesman in Tel Aviv said the state-owned defense andaerospace company won't be commenting until &quot;there is alogical opportunity with a strong profit potential.&quot; Israeland the Soviet Union have no diplomatic relations. But Dr.Hammer said the company has made five trips to the Sovietaircraft factories this year and that, under orders from Mr.Gorbachev, the Israelis were &quot;shown everything.&quot;   Aero-engine builder Pratt andamp; Whitney confirmed that it hasbeen in technical talks for the past several months with theIlyushin and Tupolev bureaus about fastening its PW2037engine on their newest models. &quot;We're pursuing it as a veryserious venture,&quot; says a spokesman. The PW2037 currentlyflies on Boeing's twin-engined 757.   Dr. Hammer said Aviation Venture International has raised$2.5 million in startup money for the project from the likesof British publisher Robert Maxwell, Canadian developerAlbert Reichmann and Israeli businessmen Shaul Eisenberg andAl Schwimmer. He added that these investors hope to raise $50million from banks or a public offering next April so thatAviation Venture International can start buying planes,engines and avionic systems. With firm orders from airlines,the venture would then be able to raise more capital from thepublic.   Aerospace specialists are enthusiastic about the design ofthe long-range Il-96 and the short- to medium-range Tu-204,both of which are now undergoing flight tests and Sovietcertification. Both have the new &quot;fly-by-wire&quot; cockpittechnology pioneered for civil airliners by Airbus. But theproblem with the existing models, especially for exportprospects, is the engines, a technology in which the Sovietstrail.   Pratt andamp; Whitney says there would be no problems fittingits PW2037 on the two Soviet jetliners. The company hasgotten U.S. government clearance to talk to the Soviets aboutthe project, the spokesman said, but it hasn't yet receivedexport licenses for the engines.   As for prospective buyers apart from Aeroflot, GPA GroupLtd., the Irish airplane lessor, has said it likes the Tu-204model and even has talked about buying some with Sovietengines. No doubt with Western engines and cockpit equipment,GPA would be even more interested. One GPA manager calls theproject &quot;feasible.&quot;   The concept of a joint airplane venture isn't entirelynew. Earlier this year, Ilyushin reportedly had talks withConstrucciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain and other Westernaerospace companies about joint development of an exportmodel of Ilyushin's new, 60-seat Il-114 turboprop commuteraircraft.   And there is a precedent of sorts. Gulfstream AerospaceCorp., a unit of Chrysler Corp., and the Sukhoi Design Bureauhave teamed up on plans for a supersonic business jet. Thetwo showed a model at the big Farnborough Air Show in Britainearlier this month.   The first international aerospace exhibition in the SovietUnion is scheduled to open Sept. 21 in Moscow and interestfrom the West is high. More than 200 exhibitors from 15countries have signed up and 90 Soviet companies will berepresented. The U.S.-Soviet-Israeli project is expected tobe a hot topic at the show.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          GULFSTREAM AEROSPACE Corp. has been sold by Chrysler Corp.and is no longer a unit of the auto maker.
