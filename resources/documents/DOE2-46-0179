<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-46-0179 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Syracuse University Medium Energy Physics Group, which consists ofa faculty member, two graduate students, and a research associate, isactively engaged in the program of research described in this document.During the past year we have obtained the first high-quality data onour experiment to measure the electroweak interference effect in thescattering of polarized electrons from carbon nuclei. Our first preliminaryresult, based on about 15 hours of beam on target, is a raw asymmetryof A = 0.6 {plus_minus} 0.7 ppM. This result is consistent with the predictionof the Standard Model of the electroweak interactions and has a statisticalerror of about the size of the expected effect. The experiment has beendone at the MIT-Bates Linear Accelerator Center in collaboration withCCNY, Harvard, MIT, and Yale. We are also a member of a collaborationincluding MIT, Alberta, SACLAY, and WPI, which is measuring the tensorpolarization of deuterons scattered by electrons. The bulk of the datawas taken during this past year. Presently the analysis is in progress.Finally, we have completed the analysis of an experiment studying thecharge states of muons leaving foils at low energies (0--20 keV). A detailedpaper on this work has been prepared for publication. This complementsan earlier paper devoted to the negative muonium ion. 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
