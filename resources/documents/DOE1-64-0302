The authors termed this unique anatomic variant &quot;retrorenalspleen.&quot; Recently the authors reviewed the CT studies of 85 patients16-85 years of age scanned in both the supine and prone positions. Therelationship of the left kidney and spleen was evaluated. The overallfrequency of retrorenal spleen was 12.7% for the supine and 17.9% forthe prone studies. Careful correlation was made between the supine andprone studies with respect to the changing anatomic relationship of thekidney and spleen. In addition, the position of the suprarenal spleenwas also evaluated in an effort to determine the safety of the subcostalapproach.</TEXT></DOC>
