<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-95-0810 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) is a transuranic radioactive wasterepository located in a bedded salt deposit in southeastern New Mexico,USA. Important issues in storing the waste are the time to saturate therepository following closure and the total cumulative fluid volume. Thesaturation time and fluid volume are related to the coupled mechanismsof salt creep, brine fluid flow, waste/backfill consolidation, and fluidrepressurization. A finite difference computer code was developed tosolve the brine flow, salt creep, and waste/backfill consolidation equationssimultaneously, assuming Darcy's Law and secondary creep of salt. Aniterative scheme was used to establish compatibility between the coupledequations. This analysis tested the qualitative relationship of thesemechanisms by employing a parametric study using, as a base case, saltproperty data available from the WIPP site. It was found that the cumulativefluid volume was strongly dependent on fluid source pressure and saltpermeability, while the saturation time depended on the mechanical propertiesof the waste/backfill material and the salt creep parameters. However,both saturation time and total fluid volume were insensitive to the initialfluid pressure distribution and small changes in salt porosity and brinecompressibility.</TEXT></DOC>
