The announcement didn't make clear whether the bid is really an attempt by Denver-based Tele-Communications, the nation's largest cable concern, to take over Des Moines, Iowa-based Heritage, the 10th largest. The companies haven't disclosed details, but John Tinker, an analyst with Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., said he understands that Heritage managers, who hold about 10% of the company, would double their stake after the acquisition and that Tele-Communications would get 80%. Tele-Communications said the companies haven't determined how the stakes will be divided.    It wasn't immediately clear whether $34 a share would be enough to win Heritage and fend off other potential bidders. Heritage said a special board panel is reviewing the latest proposal. Michael Kupinski, an analyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc., St. Louis, said the revised proposal might prevent competing bids. &quot;People aren't anticipating much of another offer, if one at all,&quot; he said.    The group had been widely expected to raise its bid. James M. Hoak Jr., Heritage president and chief executive officer, wouldn't say why it was raised, but many analysts believe the initial proposal of $32 a share, or about $835 million, was too low. Heritage shares have closed at least as high as $32 on all but one day since Jan. 31, when the initial bid was announced. And last week, a Heritage investor filed suit, charging that the $835 million total was too low.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Heritage closed at $32.75 a share, up 87.5 cents.    Heritage's stock price also has been buoyed recently by rumors that a higher bid may come from another cable company, possibly Time Inc.'s American Television andamp; Communications Corp. unit, or from Texas financier Robert M. Bass, who leads an investor group that bought a 5.8% stake in Heritage late last year.    In Denver, American Television executives said the company made an offer for Heritage before the investor group made its bid. But an American Television spokesman said he knows of no plan by the company to raise its bid, which he wouldn't disclose. A spokeswoman for Mr. Bass declined to comment. In December, when the Bass group notified the Securities and Exchange Commission of its 5.8% stake in Heritage, it said it didn't have any plans to seek control of the company.    Nonetheless, analysts are convinced that Mr. Bass had Heritage running scared. &quot;The company had talks with Bass, and they came away nervous that they might not be able to maintain control,&quot; said Adam Levy, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., New York.    Heritage is particularly vulnerable because it is one of the few publicly held cable concerns with only a single issue of stock and no dominant shareholder. Mr. Tinker of Bear Stearns said, &quot;They're kind of sitting naked.&quot;    The company is considered a plum. Heritage has grown aggressively through acquisitions in recent years, forging into attractive metropolitan markets such as Philadelphia, Dallas and San Jose, Calif. And industry analysts consider Heritage management top-notch.    Nonetheless, any hostile attempt to take over Heritage could be difficult because cable franchise changes often require approval by city councils, said Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer andamp; Co., New York. Analysts also said Tele-Communications is such a formidable competitor that other cable companies probably are leery of making a competing bid for Heritage.    Under the investor group's revised $34-a-share proposal, Heritage holders would receive as much as $8 a share in Tele-Communications Class A common stock and the balance in cash. The group also would assume about $635 million in debt. The initial bid was for $26 a share in cash plus $6 a share in Tele-Communications Class A stock.    At Tele-Communications' option, the $34-a-share proposal could be paid fully in cash, Heritage's Mr. Hoak said.    Tele-Communications has nearly 5.2 million cable subscribers. Heritage, which also has interests in advertising and TV and radio properties, has about 950,000 subscribers.    For the first nine months of 1986, Heritage had a loss of $3.3 million, on revenue of $122.9 million. In the same period, Tele-Communications earned $54.7 million, or 55 cents a share, including a $22.5 million charge from settlement of litigation, on revenue of $475.3 million. </TEXT></DOC>
