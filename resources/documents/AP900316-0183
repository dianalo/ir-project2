President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's government is trying tosell hundreds of inefficient businesses and industries, manynationalized more than 40 years ago, that have beome a cripplingdrain on the budget.   Motivations for taking over the companies were many: to free thecountry from foreign exploitation, improve the lot of workers, savejobs, avoid social unrest and bail out owners who had labor orprofit problems.   After nationalization, the companies became sinkholes ofcorruption and havens for political hacks from the rulingInstitutional Revolutionary Party.   Two generations later, privatization has become part of astrategy to reduce government subsidies, improve efficiency andobtain new foreign investment and credit as Mexico tries to emergefrom seven years of economic crisis.   ``What we have to do and what we are doing in Mexico is tocreate attractive conditions for doing business in Mexico,'' saidAngel Gurria, assistant treasury secretary in charge of foreigndebt negotiations. He mentioned the sale of state-owned companiesas one of those conditions.   A disadvantage is the loss of thousands of jobs through layoffs,either by the government before the sale or the new ownersafterward.   Heberto Castillo, a leader of the leftist opposition DemocraticRevolutionary Party, estimated 200,000 jobs were lost toprivatization and modernization in the past year.   Mexico under Salinas has become, in the eyes of its creditors, amodel for debtor nations. It has opened the economy to foreigninvestment and imports, brought down inflation and trimmed thebureaucracy and budget.   ``A state that is too busy administering its enterprises isneither just nor revolutionary,'' Salinas said Nov. 1 in his firststate of the nation address.   In January, he told residents of a poor suburb that some of themoney from sales of state companies would be used to bring themservices and that new owners of the companies would have to investin creating jobs.   Not everything is being sold.   Under the constitution, the government must own and control theoil monopoly, Petroleos Mexicanos, which includes the oiloperations expropriated from foreign companies in 1938, basicpetrochemical production, electric power, nuclear energy andradioactive minerals, satellite communications, railroads and mailservice.   It has skirted the law by shifting many petrochemicals frombasic to secondary categories, thus permitting private and foreigninvestment.   Even historic mines and steel companies, some started by thegovernment, are included on the for-sale list. The Real del Monte yPachuca silver and gold mines, which the Aztecs worked before theSpanish conquest, have been sold.   Of the 1,155 companies the government owned seven years ago, 194have been sold, 322 closed and 75 merged with others, according tothe Treasury Department.   Among items awaiting buyers are 11 fish processing plants, sevensugar refineries, two gas distributorships, the national telephonecompany, a coconut plant and the former convent.   The 1990 federal budget includes $14 billion in payments tostate-owned enterprises. That is up from $11.7 billion in 1989, butit includes social security payments and airport funds.   Luis Pazos, an economist who runs a private research center onfree enterprise, said figures on how many companies and governmentoperations have been sold or closed are unrealistic because ``manyonly existed on paper.''   He also questioned the government's commitment. If it reallywants to divest itself, the commercial banks, nationalized in 1982,should be returned to private hands, and peasants who workstate-owned farms should be given title to the land, Pazos said.   ``It's going very slowly, probably for political reasons,'' hesaid. ``There is still fear of the left.''   Some operations, including steel plants, are being held backwhile generous union contracts are renegotiated and the facilitiesare modernized.   ``We have found that, without making certain changes, thereisn't anyone to buy them,'' said Alfredo Genel, director ofindustries at the Commerce and Industrial Development Department.   ``Over the years, not only union contracts, but relations withsuppliers, then with clients, became distorted,'' he said. ``Theyaren't as rigorous in demanding the lowest price from suppliers.They gave low prices or special terms to the clients. They don'thave a group of stockholders to answer to.''   European countries found the steel industry could not be soldunless it was modernized, he said.   A privatization success story is the airline Aeromexico, whichwas famous for delays and cancellations until it was sold late in1988 to a private consortium and the pilots' union.   Now it is known for on-time performance and better service.Financial figures were not available.   The government no longer is in the soft drink, textile, cementand dish manufacturing businesses, among others.   As for the convent of Santa Catarina in Oaxaca, southern Mexico,it later was a jail and now is the Hotel Presidente.   Several hotels are on the list of government offerings, but onlythe operation of the Hotel Presidente will be sold because thebuilding is a national monument.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 25</NOTE></DOC>
