The agency said Robert Rossi, who settled the chargeswithout admitting or denying guilt, purchased stock andoptions in Rorer while in possession of material nonpublicinformation that the Fort Washington, Pa., drug company wasto be the target of a bid by the state-owned French drug andchemical concern. Mr. Rossi is an import and export traderwho lives in Africa, according to his attorney.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Rossi's lawyer, Daniel A. Pollack, said his client waswrongly charged by the SEC but settled the charges to avoidprotracted litigation in the U.S. Mr. Rossi's &quot;trading waspurely of his own analysis,&quot; Mr. Pollack said. &quot;He knows noone at Rorer, he knows no one at Rhone-Poulenc, he knows noone in the French government.&quot;   Mr. Rossi's settlement -- one of the SEC's largest againsta foreign investor -- contrasts with recent SEC efforts toimpose tough fines on alleged insider traders. Mr. Rossi's$1.4 million payout consists totally of disgorgement ofalleged profit and a small amount of interest. SEC attorneyswouldn't say why there was no fine in the case.   The SEC said Mr. Rossi acknowledged that he bought Rorersecurities for his own account through Discount Bank Ltd. andCambio Valorenbank AG, two Swiss banks that were cited in theagency's original complaint. Neither bank has been chargedwith wrongdoing.   The settlement is the first in the Rorer case. In January,even before Rhone-Poulenc was revealed to be the bidder, theSEC charged Mr. Rossi and four foreign companies with insidertrading that allegedly netted a total of nearly $6 million.Rorer subsequently was acquired by Rhone-Poulenc for about$3.23 billion.   Another defendant, Holding Protection Ltd., of Greece, isto go on trial later this month, according to SEC lawyers.Two other defendants, Unifund SAL, of Lebanon, and TamanacoSaudi andamp; Gulf Investment Group, of Panama, are appealingpreliminary injunctions granted by a federal court in NewYork. Charges have been dismissed against a fourth defendant,Fondation Hai, of Monaco, the SEC lawyers said.   The case is the second major insider-trading flap inrecent years to emerge from a French deal. The SEC last yearasked French legal authorities to investigate whetherinvestors friendly to President Francois Mitterrand andFrance's Socialist Party conducted questionable trades whilePechiney SA was negotiating to acquire American National CanCo.</TEXT></DOC>
