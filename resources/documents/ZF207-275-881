(semiconductor productionequipment)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Lapedus, Mark.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>A report published by Dataquest states that the increasingrequirements for dynamic random-access memories,application-specific integrated circuits and other devices willcause sales of semiconductor production equipment to rise by 11percent in 1989.andP;  This growth will be followed by a decline of11.6 percent in 1990.andP;  The report also states that sales offront-end equipment, such as X-ray lithography equipment, willremain stable in 1990.andP;  Specific predictions include that thelithography market will increase to $251 million in 1989, from$232 million in 1988; and that both 5:1 and 1:1 wafer steppers andelectron-beam lithographic tools used in photomask applicationswill be some of the fastest growing segments in the market.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Dataquest Inc.
