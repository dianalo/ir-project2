The House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee was toldTuesday that the nation faces a health emergency, with 150 millionAmericans now living in areas with unsafe levels of ozone and carbonmonoxide.   Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, representing the American Academy ofPediatrics and the American Public Health Association, said childrenare especially vulnerable to air pollution because their airways aremore narrow than those of adults, and because of their increasedfrequency of respiratory infections.   He said studies of children in summer camps show those exposed toozone at concentrations even below current allowable levelsdeveloped temporary respiratory problems.   ``Children's often high levels of activity put them at risk foracute respiratory effects due to ozone exposure,'' Landrigan said.   Dr. Thomas Godar, representing the American Lung Association,said Americans mistakenly ``accept dirty air as one of the facts oflife.''   ``Ozone can cause immediate, short-term changes in lung functionand increased respiratory symptoms in healthy adults and childrenwho exercise moderately or heavily during periods of elevated ozoneconcentrations,'' he said.   ``Significant decreases in lung function and symptoms such ascoughing and pain ... are experienced by exercising individualsexposed to ozone for one to two hours at levels comparable to thosefrequently found'' in unsafe air quality areas, he said.   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who will sponsor the Senate's clean airbill this year, announced that sections of the legislation will beintroduced at these time intervals: toxic air pollutants, April 3;new air quality standards, including controls on auto emissions, May1, and acid rain control, June 1.   He said a complete bill should be written before Congress' July 4recess.   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, sponsor ofclean air legislation that died last year, told senators,``Americans are suffering from a manmade phenomenon that can becontrolled. We have developed the technologies of control. We havethe resources to apply those technologies. Until now, we have lackedthe political will to do so. We must now develop that will.''   Clean air legislation has been stalled for a decade, assupporters of industry and environmental groups _ and differentregions of the country _ have fought to a standstill.   Only one witness at the House hearing, representing GeneralMotors, said that there was no conclusive evidence that current airquality levels caused lasting health problems.   The chief of General Motors Research Laboratories, Dr.Christopher C. Green, said the potential health effects fromexposure to current levels of ozone and carbon monoxide ``have beenthe subject of considerable overstatement.''   The Environmental Protection Agency said 62 areas have failed tomeet air quality standards for ozone and 59 for carbon monoxide, alist based on readings from 1985 to 1987. The list does not yetinclude 28 cities that exceeded the safe ozone levels last summer,according to EPA data.</TEXT></DOC>
