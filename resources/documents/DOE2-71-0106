The reason for this is supposed due to the unsatisfactorydependence on the low energy using in the measuring instruments. Theeffect of energy on measurements and the dose equivalent at a 1 cm depthwere discussed. 2) The back scatter radiation to the film badge is slightlyeffected by the X-ray energy. It is constant when the distance betweenthe phantom and film badge is under 3 cm and reduced over 3 cm. By adoptingICRP Pub. 26 in the near future, the dose equivalent at a 1 cm depthshould be measured inorder to provide radiation protection. It is consideredthat the calbilation will be made using a phantom. If the caliblationis made at 3 cm distance between the phantom and film badge, the doseequivalent at 1 cm depth will be underestimated when the film badge isput at a distance of over 3 cm from the body. 3) The availability ofsilicon photodiode as a sensor was considered by the method in whichan X-ray is directly exposured to one. The energy spectrum can be detectedover the 15 - 200 keV range. It has been concluded that the usage ofthis sensor can calculate the dose equivalent at a 1 cm depth for lowerenergy radiation as using clinical examination.</TEXT></DOC>
