Chairman Lee A.Iacocca received 10.8% more in total compensation in 1989than in 1988, largely because he took in more from exercisingstock options.   Mr. Iacocca's total compensation last year was $3,976,359,with $2,413,600, or about 61% of the total, coming from stockoptions, according to the No. 3 U.S. auto maker's proxystatement. His salary rose 2.7% to $889,151, while the bonusapplied to 1988 earnings fell 12.5% to $525,000.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Iacocca also received 6,174 shares of Chrysler stockvalued at $148,608 under the auto maker's long-term incentiveplan. In the preceding year, his long-term incentivecompensation was 7,056 shares with a value of $159,254.   Chrysler has said it isn't paying any bonuses on 1989earnings because it didn't make enough money to payprofit-sharing to hourly employees. Chrysler traditionallypays bonuses in the spring for the preceding year.   Gerald Greenwald, Chrysler vice chairman, was thecompany's second highest-paid executive, with totalcompensation of $1,133,637, roughly flat with a year earlier.His salary, like Mr. Iacocca's, rose 2.7% to $650,972, whilehis bonus from 1988 earnings fell 16.7% to $375,000.   Mr. Greenwald didn't exercise any stock options in 1989,but did receive 4,473 shares of Chrysler stock valued at$107,665 under the long-term incentive plan, down 6.7% from1988.   The proxy statement shows Chrysler suspended corporatecontributions to its salaried employee savings plan on Oct.1. The plan was suspended as &quot;a money-saving operation,&quot; acompany spokesman said. The savings will be counted towardthe $1.5 billion Chrysler has pledged to cut by year end fromcosts.   Chrysler previously suspended payments during 1987,reinstating them in July 1988. &quot;That, historically, is one ofthe things that has gone in and out depending on the healthof the company,&quot; the spokesman said. Chrysler reported a netloss of $664 million for the fourth quarter, after a $577million charge for, among other things, closing plants anddiscontinuing certain car lines. Analysts expect Chrysler didlittle better than break even in the quarter that ended March30.   The proxy statement also says Chrysler gave Allen E.Paulson 146,520 shares of Chrysler stock prior to Chrysler'sMarch sale of its Gulfstream Aerospace unit to a groupcontrolled by Mr. Paulson and Forstmann Little andamp; Co. Thestock was to settle an employment contract with Mr. Paulson,the chairman of Gulfstream, that could have awarded him asmany as 1,406,250 Chrysler shares for meeting certainperformance goals.   The proxy statement also discloses Chrysler has begunpaying $5,000 of its annual $20,000 directors' fee in companystock instead of paying the entire fee in cash. The move isconsistent with Mr. Iacocca's efforts to get companyexecutives to own more Chrysler shares. And according to thestatement, Chrysler bought materials, supplies and servicesfrom more than 16,000 U.S. and Canadian companies in 1989.That's 11.1% fewer than in 1988; the amount paid to allsuppliers world-wide dropped only fractionally, however, to$21.9 billion from $22.1 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
