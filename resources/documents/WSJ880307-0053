A few OPEC nations have begun restraining production, which rose in February. Some others are urging a meeting of the group's pricing committee, which could lead to a special conference of all 13 nations' oil ministers on the matter.    There is considerable skepticism in the industry that OPEC will be able to do much to firm the weak oil markets. A few crude oil traders, in fact, now say that prices, after falling $1 to $2 a barrel in the past two weeks, could fall a further $1 to $2 this month. But they also predict that will turn out to be the year's low point for oil prices.    Prices on spot and futures markets rallied briefly Friday on reports that OPEC's Vienna headquarters would begin polling members today on whether the five-minister pricing committee should call a quick meeting.    In the U.S. futures market, the benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude closed at $15.60 a barrel, up only 10 cents. Open-market prices of the North Sea's Brent crude ended flat to slightly lower at $14.05 a barrel for March delivery and $14.45 a barrel for April.    With OPEC's average prices having dropped to near $15 a barrel, compared with the official benchmark of $18, Venezuela's oil minister, a member of the pricing committee, reportedly is calling for the meeting. But an OPEC spokesman said no request to poll other members on such a meeting had been received in Vienna by the weekend.    The committee, which also includes Saudi Arabia's oil minister, monitors world oil prices and is authorized to call a conference of all OPEC members if it believes the pricing situation warrants one. But in recent interviews, Saudi sources have indicated that they oppose calling any meetings before the scheduled midyear session because they expect little would be accomplished.    Industry sources said, however, that Mana Said Otaiba and Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, the oil ministers of the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, respectively, have been traveling frequently to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to meet with Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister.    Although a Kuwait source said the visits were routine, all three countries have been holding production at or below their OPEC quotas in recent weeks. OPEC output rose slightly last month after dropping to 17 million barrels a day in January.    According to International Energy Agency estimates to be released in Paris today, OPEC production averaged 17.4 million barrels a day in February. But not all the production is moving directly to the market, the agency says. &quot;Part of February output has gone into stocks (above-ground storage) for the account of producing countries,&quot; the agency's monthly oil market report says.    Among others, Nigeria increased its production last month through new price incentives to refiners. Iraq, despite its war with Iran, also has been producing at close to its capacity of three million barrels a day, Abdul-Amir Al-Anbari, the Iraqi ambassador to the U.S., said at a meeting Friday of the Houston World Trade Association.    Despite the rise in average output last month, OPEC production has been slowing in recent days. At one point in February, for example, production was as high as 18 million barrels a day, according to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, which also tracks OPEC output. That authoritative industry publication puts February's average OPEC production at 17.5 million barrels a day, slightly higher than the IEA estimate.    &quot;But we see March production running below that,&quot; a Petroleum Intelligence Weekly editor says. </TEXT></DOC>
