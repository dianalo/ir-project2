<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-78-0538 </DOCNO><TEXT>An application was made before the Alberta Energy Resources ConservationBoard for a license to drill a natural gas well in a sub-alpine basin.This land is classified according to an integrated resource plan suchthat if the land is used for petroleum development, it would be subjectto special conditions and controls to ensure that its recreation intentis preserved and wildland character protected. A hearing was held toconsider the views of the applicant and others, including a number ofpublic interest groups concerned with environment and wildlife. The Boardconsidered the following issues at the hearing: the Board's jurisdictionin considering the application; technical matters regarding the needfor the well and appropriate well location; gas resource values; wildland/recreationalvalues; ecological concerns regarding biosphere, wildlife, fisheries,vegetation and reclamation; and the need for an ongoing consultativeprocess. Findings of the Board include the following. The well wouldnot pose a serious hazard to the public, and the only technically suitableand safe surface location is that chosen by the applicant. The potentialeconomic benefits of the well would be very large. Near-term economiccosts through alteration of wildland recreation values may be significant,but should eventually become imperceptible following land reclamationand revegetation. A program of carefully timed and managed access forconstruction, drilling, testing, and completion must be put into effectto ensure reliable watershed protection and preserve wildlands; a continuingevaluation and montoring program is also necessary. Accordingly, theapplication was approved. 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
