All the measurements were performed by means of INAAafter the hair samples were carefully washed according to standard procedures.The results for all elements investigated do not differ significantlyfrom reported values for other regions of the world. The levels of As,Hg, and Sb are significantly different for the various groups and arestrongly linked to local environmental factors.</TEXT></DOC>
