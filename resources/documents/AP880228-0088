Alitalia, Italy's state-run airline, canceled hundreds offlights to and from Rome's airports because of a 24-hour strike byground personnel. It was the latest in a series of walkouts toprotest lack of progress in contract renewal negotiations.   Alitalia's intercontinental flights and its connections toItaly's islands operated normally, as did flights by otherairlines. Passengers, however, often had to wait for more than hourfor their baggage.   New contract talks are set to begin Monday.   Long-distance train service from Rome's main station suffereddisruptions from a 24-hour strike by railway employees that startedat 9 p.m.   Italy's major daily newspapers did not publish Sunday as aresult of a 48-hour nationwide walkout by journalists protestingstalemated contract talks. Only a few regional papers exempt fromthe strike came out Sunday.   Television and radio ran limited news broadcasts Sunday withoutfilm reports. On Monday, television and radio stations are tocancel all newscasts.   The journalists' strike prevented most Italians from readingabout the exploits of Tomba, who won his second Olympic gold medalSaturday in alpine skiing.   Paese Sera, one of the dailies exempt from the strike, ran afront-page headline saying ``Alberto Tomba Is Already a Legend.''</TEXT></DOC>
