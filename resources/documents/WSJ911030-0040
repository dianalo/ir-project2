For several months, selling at technology companies haseclipsed selling in all other industries, even thehealth-care field, the frequent leader in insider sellingbecause of the number of start-up firms that compensateexecutives heavily with stock options.   What's particularly striking, according to Invest/Net, isthat the selling is across the board in all three technologysectors: hardware, software and semiconductor companies.   Industries leading in insider buying are interest-ratesensitive sectors such as banking and electric utilities,according to Invest/Net.</TEXT></DOC>
