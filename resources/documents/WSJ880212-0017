<DOC><DOCNO> WSJ880212-0017 </DOCNO><HL> Business Brief: Apache Corp. </HL><SO> </SO><CO> APA </CO><TEXT>   Apache Corp., Denver, said its 1987 results will include an after-tax charge of about $75 million as a result of recent agreements with gas pipelines to settle so-called take-or-pay claims.    For 1986, Apache had a loss of $10.9 million and revenue of $171.7 million, including a $15.3 million write-down of oil and gas properties.    Under previous agreements, the oil and gas firm's natural gas was contractually committed to pipeline companies that refused to take or to pay for the gas because it was priced above competitive rates. Apache said the settlements release the pipelines from further purchases under the old contracts and provide Apache with sizable cash payments, improved transportation for its gas, and the opportunity to sell larger volumes at competitive prices.    Apache said the actual amount of the write-down will be reported when it releases its annual results Feb. 18.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Apache closed at $8.75, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
