(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge ruled against a woman who sued anewspaper in an effort to prohibit it from printing news of herdivorce.   ``The state of Rhode Island ... has expressly made thatinformation a matter of public record,'' Superior Court JudgeRichard J. Israel wrote in the decision.   The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a woman using the name JaneDoe. She was delaying her final divorce decree in hopes it wouldnot be printed in The Newport Daily News. The newspaper reportedthe judge's decision Tuesday.   A second woman, calling herself Allison Roe, was allowed to jointhe suit earlier this month. The woman claimed that she receivedobscene phone calls the day her divorce notice appeared in thepaper.   Thomas W. Kelly, the attorney for the two women, argued thatprinting divorce records of private persons violated the statePrivacy Act.   But Joseph V. Cavanagh Jr., the paper's lawyer, argued thatdivorces are considered public information. He said the U.S.Supreme Court had ruled in favor of newspapers that printed courtinformation.   Cavanagh also argued any ban would violate the First Amendmentto the Constitution.   Israel did not rule on the constitutional issue but rejectedKelly's privacy argument.   ``It was a mistake for Jane Doe or any other person to seek acourt order telling The Daily News not to publish the news aboutdivorces or other matters in court,'' said David B. Offer, editorof the paper.</TEXT></DOC>
