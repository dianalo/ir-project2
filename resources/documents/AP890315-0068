No casualties were reported Monday and Tuesday in what the dailynewspaper Sydney Morning Herald today said was believed to be one ofthe heaviest rainfalls since Australia was settled by Europeans in1788.   Australian weather records, however, have only been kept since1924.   The Meteorogical Agency said parts of the parched continent hadexperienced the first rain in years.   In the state of South Australia, nearly 11 inches of rain fell in24 hours. The normally dry Wilpena Creek became a 12-mile-wide riverwhile the opal mining town of Andamooka in Western Australia statewas knee-deep in water.   Residents at Broken Hill, in far western New South Wales, saidreservoirs were almost overflowing after a year's supply of rainfell in just two days. They said it was the worst flooding since1932.   Broken Hill Water Board spokesman Noel Wood said residents hadbeen forced to cope with severe water restrictions last week. Now,he said, the town's reservoirs are at their highest level since 1974.   The rains deluged three of the continent's six states, fromWestern and central Australia to the eastern seaboard, causingmillions of dollars in damage and loss of livestock to isolatedrural farms.   In Canberra, the federal capital, police warned children to stayaway from swirling stormwater drains throughout the city, whereflooding closed several roads.   Many Outback farms were flooded out, and news reports headlinedthe downpour as the ``The Big Wet.''</TEXT></DOC>
