(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Investigators trying to decide if a mancharged with a New Mexico murder is linked to slayings in threeother states waited Tuesday for the results of ballistics tests ona gun found in the man's car.   A second man, arrested in Oklahoma, already has been charged intwo of those killings of store operators and clerks last week.Police have said no link has been found between the two men.   The ballistics tests are expected Wednesday, said Don Bullis, aspokesman for the New Mexico Department of Public Safety in SantaFe.   Greg Francis Braun, 28, of Garden City, Kan., was arraigned hereMonday on an open charge of murder in the death of a woman who wasshot twice in the head at a mini-mart in Springer. Braun, arrestedat a roadblock near Cimarron, was being held in lieu of $1 millionbond.   Springer Police Chief Lewie Baker said the handgun found Mondayon the seat of Braun's car was a .25-caliber.   Paul Renfrow, an Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigationspokesman in Oklahoma City, has said that ballistics tests linkedone weapon to slayings in Ardmore, Okla., Garden City, Kan., andPampa, Texas. Authorities have said the victims were shot with a.25-caliber weapon.   Investigators from Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas arrived Monday totry to talk to Braun about those slayings.   But Ray Floersheim, Braun's public defender, said Tuesday hewould not allow anyone to talk to his client. A preliminary hearingis tentatively set for Aug. 2, Floersheim said.   Another man, Michael Frank Greene, 37, of Inola, Okla., has beencharged in the Oklahoma and Texas cases. He was being held withoutbond in Oklahoma where he was arrested. A preliminary hearing onthe Oklahoma charge is set for Sept. 28.   Police did not find a gun on Greene.   Garden City police Capt. Stan Wojdylak said no link has beenfound between Braun and Greene.   Carter County District Attorney Fred Collins of Ardmore, whofiled a first-degree murder charge against Greene, said Monday hedidn't want to discuss that charge until he had studied findingsfrom New Mexico.   ``This is the most ridiculous headache. It is not simple,''Collins said.   Assistant District Attorney Gary Henry said prosecutors stillbelieve the evidence against Greene in the Ardmore case is good.   ``Either he (Greene) is our guy or he's the unluckiest humanbeing that ever lived,'' Henry said.   Ardmore Assistant Police Chief David Willingham said one of thesurvivors of the shootings there identified Greene from photographsas the man who shot them.   Pampa police have charged Greene with capital murder in theshooting of a photo processing business owner.</TEXT></DOC>
