A New York State judge said that granting the requestwould have had &quot;a chilling effect on a client's revealingconfidences to the attorney.&quot; The bills in this case showedthe attorneys' diary entries and descriptions of the workdone.</LP><TEXT>   Time Warner Sports, a unit of New York-based Time WarnerInc., had sought the legal bills in a contract dispute. Thecompany sued the players' association last year after theplayers ended their licensing agreement with the company.Under such agreements, the company pays royalties to theplayers and the teams for any commercial use of names orinsignia.   The association broke the contract because it alleged thatTime Warner Sports had a conflict of interest insimultaneously representing the players and NHL team ownersin licensing contracts.   The association, which has filed counterclaims against thecompany, maintains that in some instances Time Warner Sportsfavored the owners at the expense of the players and failedto obtain revenues that were available to players, said JohnR. McCambridge, an attorney for the players with the Chicagolaw firm of Grippo andamp; Elden.   Time Warner Sports argued that the legal bills would showthat the players' association had been plotting to come upwith a reason to break the agreement so that it could cut thecompany out of a licensing deal involving trading cards. Italso maintained that the bills from Grippo andamp; Elden andGoodman andamp; Goodman in Toronto would show that the associationhad made false statements in the case.   But Justice Herman Cahn, after reviewing the legal bills,rejected the request. The judge said that while retainer andfee agreements may be subject to pretrial fact-findingrequests, &quot;the actual bills detailing the work done by theattorneys are clearly privileged material.&quot; Allowing accessto the bills, he said, would disclose trial strategy and makethe attorneys themselves potential witnesses in the case.   Justice Cahn said disclosing the bills, which includeattorneys' time sheets and descriptions of the workperformed, &quot;would reveal certain privileged communicationsmade between {the association} and its attorneys.&quot;   Requests for detailed legal bills are unusual and arerarely granted, said Stephen Gillers, professor of legalethics at New York University School of Law. But if the legalbills would show an alleged fraud, that could be an exceptionto the attorney-client privilege that otherwise protects thebills from being turned over, he said.   Attorneys for Time Warner Sports declined to comment.(Time Warner Sports vs. National Hockey League Players Assn.,State Supreme Court, Manhattan, No. 9413/91)   ---   EMPLOYMENT BIAS case at Harvard Law to be heard by state'shigh court.   A decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Courtallows the Harvard Law Coalition for Civil Rights, a studentgroup, to bypass an intermediate court and argue that it hasa right to bring a discrimination suit against Harvard LawSchool.   In November 1990, the coalition sued the school, alleginga pattern of discriminatory faculty hiring over 20 years.There are five women, all of them white, and five members ofminority groups on the law school's 66-member faculty.   Last year, a Superior Court judge dismissed the suit,ruling that only employees, former employees or candidatesfor employment can bring employment-discrimination suits. Thestudents, the judge said, did not allege that the law schooldiscriminated against students.   Allan Ryan Jr., a Harvard University lawyer defending theuniversity, noted that it takes just two out of seven votesfor the state Supreme Judicial Court to bypass a lower appealcourt. Even if the students are granted the right to sueHarvard, he added, a lower court will have to determine themerits of the case.   Ozell Hudson Jr., executive director of the Lawyers'Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law, which representsthe students, said the court's decision to hear the appealshows that the court realizes that the issue of the students'right to sue is an important matter for other schools andinstitutions as well as for Harvard.   ---   ACCOUNTANCY BOARD sues to deny license to foreign-trainedapplicant.   Hugo J. Ruiz last May became the first Cuban-bornFloridian in about 10 years to pass the state's certificationtest for foreign-trained accountants. But the stateAccountancy Board is contesting his right to a license,claiming that the test -- rewritten by the state in 1986 toremove alleged cultural bias -- doesn't adequately gaugebasic skills.   So far, only 10 people -- all Cuban exiles -- have takenthe modified test. Two of these people have since died.   The argument that various standardized tests areculturally biased has generated controversy nationwide. Inthe accountancy case, the claim was that some sections of thetest used words and concepts that foreign-trained accountantsweren't likely to understand. &quot;When I first heard a professortalk about `business law,' I said, `This is not the English Ilearned in Cuba.' I did not know what he meant,&quot; said EugenioSanson, a Miami accountant who helped rewrite the test.   So far the Accountancy Board, a subagency of stategovernment, has won a court order blocking the state fromlicensing any of the eight Cuban exiles who took the modifiedexam, including Mr. Ruiz, the only one to pass all parts ofit. The state's appeal is pending.   (Fla. Dept. of Professional Regulation and Hugo J. Ruiz etal. vs. Fla.
