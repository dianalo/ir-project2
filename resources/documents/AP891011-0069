The confrontation between the cadets and a threatening moboccurred Tuesday night in Stepanakert in the southern Soviet Union,said Yuri M. Arshenevsky of the ministry's press office in Moscow.   He said eight civilians were in critical condition.   Arshenevsky said the cadets were riding in 19 vehicles andcrossing a bridge into Stepanakert when a mob materialized andbegan throwing stones and firing on the passing column. He said thefirefighters were forced to shoot in self-defense.   But representatives of a pro-Armenian group _ Nagorno Karabakhis a predominantly Armenian enclave in the republic of Azerbaijanand the focus of a bloody ethnic dispute _ said the crowd wasnon-violent.   Ashot Manucharyan, an Armenian legislator from the region, saidin a telephone interview from the headquarters of the KarabakhCommittee in Yerevan, the capital of neighboring Armenia, that thecivilians were attracted to the bridge by warning shots fired intothe air by the cadets.   He claimed one civilian was killed in addition to the eightwounded.   The Karabakh Committee has led the campaign for the annexationof Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenian jurisdiction. Azerbaijanis arepredominantly Moslem and most Armenians are Christians.   It was not clear if the firefighters also were soldiers, buttroops have been stationed in Nagorno-Karabakh to try to keep thepeace for the past year.   On Tuesday, leaders of a grass-roots Azerbaijani movementsuspended a rail strike that choked off supplies of fuel, food andhousing supplies to Armenia, a member said.   ``We decided in a directive to open the railroad to Armenia asof (10 p.m.),'' Ingilap Aslanov, a member of the People's Front andof the group's strike committee, said by telephone from theAzerbaijani capital Baku.   He said the strike was suspended until Oct. 23 to give Sovietlegislators in Moscow a chance to respond to Azerbaijan's demandsto remove special Kremlin administration of Nagorno-Karabakh.   Soviet troops moved into the neighboring republics last week tobreak the blockade that has been strangling Armenia andNagorno-Karabakh. About 400 trains with 60,000 cars were reportedidled.   Most supply routes must pass through Azerbaijan to reach Armenia.   Official news media said Tuesday that in the previous 24 hoursauthorities managed to push 1,748 carloads of supplies through toArmenia.   But Deputy Premier Lev Voronin told the Supreme Sovietlegislature that did not include oil products. A fuel shortage hasstranded ambulances and halted harvesting in Armenia's fields.   Reports said freight arriving in Armenia under military guardwas damaged.   Aslanov said the Azerbaijan People's Front wanted the issue ofNagorno-Karabakh taken up by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet,the country's highest-ranking executive body, but settled fordemanding that the Supreme Soviet legislature review the question.   If it does not do so by Oct. 23, the People's Front will call ageneral strike that once again will include the railroads, he said.   The People's Front says the rail strike started Sept. 4, butArmenian officials say the flow of goods by rail through Azerbaijandried up almost three months ago.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, opening the fall session of theSupreme Soviet on Sept. 25, called for firm steps to break thetransportation deadlock.   After hearing Tuesday from Voronin, the Supreme Soviet onceagain called on Armenia and Azerbaijan to end their dispute.</TEXT></DOC>
