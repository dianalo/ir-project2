In Damascus, Syria, Iran's foreign minister said Israel mustunconditionally release the cleric, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, andindicated Iran will not use its influence to free hostages inLebanon until Obeid is free.   Israel's military censor, meanwhile, asked police to open aninvestigation into a report in the Sunday Times of London and theWashington Post that two of three Israeli soldiers missing inLebanon are dead, said Eitan Haber, spokesman for Defense MinisterYitzhak Rabin.   The Jerusalem Post reported today that an extensive investigationwas underway to pinpoint the source of the report. Cabinet ministerswill be investigated as well, it said.   An army spokesman said Obeid, the Lebanese cleric kidnapped byIsraeli commandos on July 28, is being held for six months under anadministrative detention order signed by Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. DanShomron. He did not say where Obeid was.   Israel accuses Obeid of coordinating attacks by the Moslemfundamentalist Hezbollah on Israeli troops in south Lebanon.   Administrative detainees, generally Palestinians, are usuallyallowed to have a lawyer and appeal their detention. But the armyspokesman, who is not identified under military regulations, wouldnot say if Obeid had such rights.   Obeid's abduction July 28 worldwide attention after a radicalShiite group in Lebanon claimed to have killed an American hostage,Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, in retaliation.   Israel has demanded the release of three Israelis missing inLebanon as well as 16 foreign hostages in exchange for Obeid andother Shiite Moslem prisoners. The hostage held longest is Terry A.Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, today dampened hopeshis country might use its influence with kidnap groups to free thehostages.   ``We hope that Sheik Obeid will be released,'' he said afterarriving in Syria for talks on the Lebanese war. ``This releaseshould take place without any prior conditions _ no talks, nodiscussions before Sheik Obeid is released.''   On Sunday, the front pages of Israeli papers carried headlinesquoting the Sunday Times story that two of the three missingIsraelis were in fact dead.   The story said intelligence officers questioning Obeid haveconcluded that the two infantrymen died of wounds soon after theircar was ambushed in south Lebanon in February 1986.   Israel's chief army spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ephraim Lapid, did notconfirm or deny the report but said the government considers itssoldiers to be alive unless it is given documentary proof to thecontrary.   In another report on the hostage affair, The Independent ofLondon said Monday that Obeid's abduction had sabotaged sensitiveovertures by Israel to Iran and the Hezbollah to free the prisoners.   The paper said the inner Cabinet appointed a three-man team tonegotiate with the Hezbollah that consists of Uri Lubrani, chiefcoordinator of Israeli policy in Lebanon; Gen. Ran Goren, head ofthe army's manpower branch; and Ori Slonim, a Tel Aviv lawyer andconfidante of Rabin.   The team had ``opened new channels with Iran and the Hezbollahvia two Palestinan Shiites who have close links with Teheran,'' thepaper said. Frustrated by the slow progress of negotiations, Israelkidnapped Obeid, it said.   It said Rabin expected the kidnapping to hasten the negotiations,but instead Hezbollah broke off the contacts in anger.   Rabin's spokesman, Haber, refused to comment on the Independentreport. Other officials also declined to comment, saying the issuewas sensitive.   One security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said thereport was ``nonsense.''</TEXT></DOC>
