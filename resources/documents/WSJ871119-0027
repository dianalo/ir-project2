That would be good news on the inflation front, likely benefiting the bond market and much of the stock market. The last time oil prices collapsed, in early 1986, bonds staged their greatest rally in 50 years. It would also help cut costs for U.S. oil consumers.    Mr. Jacoboski downgraded several oil stocks to a &quot;hold&quot; rating yesterday, including Atlantic Richfield, Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., and Sun Co. He also lowered his earnings estimates for them to reflect an average 1988 oil price of $18 a barrel instead of $20.    For example, Mr. Jacoboski dropped his 1988 estimate for Arco, one of the most sensitive to oil-price changes, to $6.95 a share from $8.55. Arco stock responded by falling 2 3/4 at midday yesterday before recovering, as oil prices rebounded, to close at 72 3/8, down 5/8.    The PaineWebber analyst doesn't think the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries could put through a price increase at its next meeting Dec. 9 in Vienna even if all 13 members agreed they wanted to because &quot;overproduction since July has put a price increase out of reach.&quot;    Because oil inventories are 100 million barrels higher than a year ago, he says, &quot;I think it will be a struggle for OPEC to sustain an average price of $18 into 1988.&quot; To support a higher price, he says, would require a production ceiling lower than this year's 16.6 million barrels a day, and that &quot;isn't achievable politically.&quot;    Mr. Jacoboski says OPEC will have a tough time bringing Iraq, which has been exceeding its implied quota of 1.5 million barrels a day by 1 million barrels or more, back into the fold. And the group runs the risk that other members, such as Venezuela, Ecuador and Gabon, may bolt.    Even though spot-market oil prices hit a three-month low Tuesday, Mr. Jacoboski's view is still in the minority. In fact, in a day of wild price swings yesterday, crude oil fell 35 cents a barrel to $18.05 before rebounding to finish up 24 cents at $18.64. One factor behind the turnaround: confirmation that the Kuwait Investment Office has bought 10% of British Petroleum, suggesting that Kuwait is bullish on the oil outlook.    William Randol of First Boston has been recommending Chevron, Mobil, Texaco Inc. and BP since the crash because &quot;we have felt the group was a good defensive place to park money in an extremely uncertain stock market environment.&quot; Some of their dividend yields, he adds, approach 6.5%. (Fat as the dividends are now, Mr. Jacoboski warns, they were even higher relative to Treasury bond yields during the price collapse of 1986.)    But Mr. Randol counters that changing investment opinions &quot;based on what may or may not happen at an OPEC meeting is a high-risk strategy and has been a formula for disaster recently.&quot; He noted the outcomes of the past few OPEC get-togethers have been more favorable than the market expected.    The First Boston analyst acknowledges there have been &quot;signs of strain&quot; in oil prices, but says, &quot;we are not panicking yet.&quot;    A few months ago, analysts projected rising consumption and declining OPEC supplies. Tensions were rising in the Persian Gulf, and supply disruptions were threatened. Now, Mr. Randol says, output from non-OPEC nations is increasing, while a weaker economy may weaken demand. In the past two weeks, he says, chances that OPEC will raise prices next month have been cut in half.    In the unlikely event that the cartel dissolved, output was unleashed, and prices were set solely by the market, Mr. Randol says, oil would sell below $10 a barrel. Prices briefly sank to $9 in mid-1986. Mr. Randol thinks cartel members &quot;learned their lesson&quot; and will avoid a rerun of the 1986 collapse.    However, Mr. Randol said Nov. 6 that he thought the chances were 50% that OPEC could put through a $1 or $2 price increase next month. Now, he believes the probability is less than 50%. In that period, the spot-market price has fallen from more than $20.    Paul Mlotok of Salomon Brothers also doubts OPEC will raise prices in December, but likes oil stocks because of their &quot;incredible financial strength.&quot; He believes their high yields can be sustained because their projected five-year earnings growth ranges from 8% for Exxon and Shell to 12% for Mobil and Chevron.    In addition, Mr. Mlotok says, earnings represent only 40% of oil companies' cash flow because of depreciation and other charges, which means &quot;you could put a heavy hit on earnings and still have phenomenal cash flow to carry your dividends.&quot;    The Salomon analyst is recommending Chevron and Mobil, which both yield around 6%, and which he believes will both be raising their dividends.    Mr. Mlotok says Chevron's per-share cash flow next year will be $11.50, well above his earnings estimate of $3.40 and the $2.40 dividend. &quot;They could have zero earnings and still have $8 in cash flow,&quot; he adds. Mobil has $9.30 a share in cash flow to cover a $2.20 dividend.    Dan McKinley, who runs the $80 million Fidelity Select Energy fund, agrees that oil stocks are now &quot;reasonably attractive&quot; based on their dividend-growth prospects. He too believes &quot;the '86 debacle was an expensive lesson that was well-learned&quot; for OPEC.    However, another money manager, who asked not to be identified, said, &quot;All in all, if a test of prices is coming, it's better to buy the stocks during the test than before. Times have been good for OPEC, and maybe they need another lesson for everybody to come back into the fold. If we're lucky, maybe we'll get a good chance to buy these stocks more cheaply.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
