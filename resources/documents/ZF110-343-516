in this case, was defined as &quot;product not in thenormal range -- not spread sheets or word processors, but products that dopieces of many different things.&quot;andM;The panel consisted of four users who were reporting on their experience withthis type of software.andM;1.andP;  Maureen Dalia Connolly, Texaco, Inc.andM;Her area of the company, which tracks their activities in the Middle and FarEast, had a problem: they had too much paper and microfiche, their local andremote storage was overburdened, they had multiple copies stored in differentplaces, any data gathering was a time consuming chore.andM;They wanted to improve their support capability, increase productivity, gaina competitive edge, and save money.andP;  (Would anyone care to argue with thatlist?andP;  Or doubt that they wanted those things?)andP;  Her area alone accumulates50,000 papers each year.andP;  They needed a system that would (a) make use of theequipment they had on hand, and (b) provide them with &quot;easy access.&quot;andM;They investigated &quot;text processing&quot; systems --those systems did notaccommodate 60% of the documentation (because of graphics, signatures,non-text data).andP;  Then the investigated imaging systems.andP;  Hallelujah]  Fastaccess, improved control, multiple search paths, and reduced paper quantityand handling]andM;Their next decision was make-or-buy?andP;  They decided it was easier and cheaperto buy.andM;The wanted a system that is industry standard, provides flexibleimplementation, has modular components, and is &quot;software oriented&quot; (would usetheir existing hardware).andM;Their choice: &quot;Vision Star.&quot;andP;  &quot;It provides excellent work flow, a friendlyinterface, supports our existing topology,&quot; and Texaco could check referencesthat were using comparable systems.andM;&quot;Six weeks after the contract was signed, we had an installed pilot system.&quot;andO;The user acceptance was phenomenal]&quot;  They are in the process of installingthe system all over Texaco.andM;2.andP;  George John, Price WaterhouseandM;The product they are happy with is Lotus Notes.andP;  They are so deliriouslyhappy they are buying 10,000 copies.andP;  (That makes Lotus kinda happy too.)andM;Price waterhouse wanted to &quot;collect, manage, and access [company] cumulativeexpertise.&quot;andM;After seeing a demo of Lotus Notes, &quot;even the [anti-tech] people wereconvinced it really could help them.andP;  They immediately had ideas of how theycould use the product.&quot;andM;The product is being used to:andM;1.andP;  keep the professionals currentandM;2.andP;  disseminate corporate knowledgeandM;3.andP;  manage their corporate communicationsandM;4.andP;  act as their &quot;information distribution system&quot; -- it interfaces withexternal information systems and a variety of online systems.andM;TThe heart of the system is E-Mall and a document broadcasting capability.&quot;andM;&quot;Users are demanding the product.&quot;andM;He reminded the audience that &quot;global changes in the way you do business[require] rethinking -- and you need technology to support [the changes] youdecide upon.&quot;andM;3.andP;  Dave Holyoak, Grant Thornton (accounting firm)andM;Their problem concerned the mountains of regulation and reference books thataccountants are buried under.andP;  &quot;folio Views&quot; came to their aid.andP;  &quot;It handlesall types of free form textandgt; it is an electronic bookshelf.&quot;andP;  It does:andM;* full-text searching and retrieval -- using Boolean statementsandM;* hypertext linkage -- to get between documentsandM;* searches multiple information bases simultaneouslyandM;* provides a browsing capability in full text modeandM;He praised the product highly and redommends it for &quot;significant research andreference problems.&quot;andM;4.andP;  Gary Whipple, Union Carbide CorporationandM;They had a four-pronged problem:andM;1.andP;  They needed to ber aware of the status of everchanging government lawsand regulations and company procedures.andM;2.andP;  They needed full-text documents for searches.andM;3.andP;  They wanted an on-line action-planner that would provide ticklers forschedules.andM;4.andP;  They needed a &quot;usable communications system.&quot;andM;Mr.andP;  Whipple claims their solution is not &quot;exotic&quot; because the pieces are&quot;available off-the-shelf.&quot;andP;  After carefully examinating alternatives, theydecided upon a set of desktop computer tools (they wanted to mainframedependency).andM;They have an action planner, an E-Mall system, and an on-line search anddestroy -- No] -- search and retrieve system.andP;  The products they have workingin close cooperation are:andM;* &quot;SYZYGY&quot; for their action plannerandM;* &quot;Folio View&quot; for search and retrievalandM;* &quot;Da Vinci&quot; with a message handling service (MHS) for E-Mail.andM;They are pleased with the results.andM;CAN COMMENT: Our readers know we are opposed to vendor commercials disguisedas technical presentations.andP;  These testimonials were different.andP;  Here areusers who are so impressed and so pleased by the products they are using,they are willing to stand before an audience and praise them.andP;  No vendorcould ask for a better endorsement]</TEXT></DOC>
