David I. Shapiro, a court-appointed examiner reviewing Eastern'sChapter 11 bankruptcy filing protection, requested the FAA report,the Times reported in Saturday's editions.   The FAA also gave a passing grade to the replacement pilotsEastern hired and praised the airline's improved trainingprocedures, the Times reported.   ``We've really been raked over the coals by the unions. ... It'sgratifying that the FAA says it's satisfied,'' said Edward F. Upton,Eastern vice president for maintenance and engineering. Eastern isowned by Texas Air Corp., which is headed by Frank Lorenzo.   Officials at the unions, which went on strike March 4, dismissedthe FAA report and questioned the integrity of the investigators.   The FAA investigators ``see no evil, hear no evil and speak noevil of Lorenzo and the Texas Air management,'' said Donald L.Miller, shop committee chairman in Miami for the InternationalAssociation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.</TEXT></DOC>
