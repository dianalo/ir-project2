A decade ago, the action of the energy and power subcommittee ofthe House Energy and Commerce Committee would have followed battlesbetween consuming and producing states.   Memories of those battles led Congress and its committees toignore the Reagan administration's almost annual requests forremoval of controls.   Thursday, it took only 12{ minutes for the subcommittee toapprove, by voice vote and without dissent, the bill sponsored by22 of its 23 members.   A previous decontrol episode in 1985 saw prices collapse,confounding predictions of a pocketbook-bashing ``fly-up'' ofprices. Many analysts now believe gas prices are determined by oilprices because many industrial users can switch between the two.   Most believe decontrol will have little immediate effect ifdemand does not increase as ceiling prices frequently are wellabove spot prices.   The last major gas pricing battle in Congress came in 1978, whenharsh winters, diversion of gas into unregulated intrastate marketsand soaring oil prices all combined to curtail gas deliveries tothe Midwest and Northeast.   To encourage new production, Congress enacted several differentprices for gas according to source, such as tight sands or verydeep wells, and permitted those prices to rise with inflation. Italso provided that much of that gas would be decontrolled in 1985,as it was.   But gas from existing wells was to remain under price controls.That gas is a smaller percentage of the supply every year and todayis 25 percent to 30 percent of gas flowing through pipelines,according to the Natural Gas Supply Association.   Since 1985, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hasdeclared that the ceiling price of certain gas could rise to theprice of the most expensive category.   That ceiling price, which rises with inflation, is now $2.79 perthousand cubic feet. The March average spot price in majorproducing states, according to the newsletter Natural GasIntelligence, was $1.44. Some old gas is sold for 30 cents.   The bill does not abrogate contracts. Some contracts provide formarket pricing under decontrol but others do not.</TEXT></DOC>
