One is offans; many of the events are being held in relative private.I've been at five different venues -- men's Alpine downhillat Val d'Isere, speed skating at Albertville, biathlon at LesSaisies, luge at La Plagne and hockey here -- and aside fromyesterday's U.S.-Finland hockey game saw nothing approachinga full house, or hill.   Bonnie Blair, for instance, won her speed-skating goldmedal before, maybe, 3,000 people seated in bleachers thathold twice that many. If you didn't count press, officialsand members of national teams there to cheer on their mates,the number would have been closer to 2,000.</LP><TEXT>   Part of the blame traces to the Games' spread-out nature;many of the venues are in remote mountain villages served bytwo-lane roads from which private-vehicle traffic has beenbarred on event days. Another part must fall on the Games'organizers, who discouraged potential visitors by booking orcausing to be booked huge blocks of hotel rooms far inadvance, then failing to fill them all. This has happened atevery Olympics I've attended.   And the French public hasn't responded, something thatcomes as no surprise to the French journalists with whom I'vespoken. &quot;We are not -- how do you say it? -- particularlysports-minded,&quot; said one. That's how you say it.   Shortage No. 2 is of decent souvenirs; the stands I'veseen are peddling generic-looking stuff I'd blush to bringhome, so I won't. You'd expect more from a nation thatincludes the world's fashion capital.   A third shortage pertains to the schedule of events, andis no fault of the French. The calendar here includes 13sports, two of which (speed skiing and curling) are classedas demonstrations, meaning their medals don't count. Thatcontrasts with the 30-odd sports of the Summer Games. Andbecause -- to maximize TV bucks -- both seasons' Games arespread over a 16-day calendar (you get three weekends thatway), the daily winter fare often is scanty.   This doesn't reflect any lack of trying by Olympichonchos; the Winter Games are dotted with combination events(slalom and downhill skiing, cross-country skiing andski-jumping, cross-country skiing and riflery), andout-and-out weird things like speed skiing, that seem to havebeen designed with schedule-padding in mind. But alas, theproblem remains.   So I am coming to the rescue with some new sports thatwill not only flesh out the calendar, but will broaden thescope of the Games with events to which many more people canrelate than presently. Why should the Hans-and-Fritz typesget all the glory?                                                                                                          50-meter Sidewalk Shovel -- Lined up eight abreast,contestants would clean identical walks covered with 18inches of wet, heavy snow, using shovels that cost no morethan $9.95 at True Value Hardware. The first one finishedwins, after suitable penalties for missed patches.                                                                                                          Moto Curse -- Contestants would clean the same walks asabove using snowblowers no less than five years old, and withat least 80% of their original parts.                                                                                                          25-meter Newspaper Pickup and Return -- Dressed only inslippers, pajamas and bathrobes without sashes or otherfasteners, contestants would retrieve a newspaper from themiddle of a snow-covered lawn and return &quot;home&quot; through adoor with no fewer than three front steps. Athletes would bepermitted to run directly through the snow, or take a lessdirect but maybe faster path via an icy walk. Again, besttime wins, with penalties for snow in slippers at finish.                                                                                                          Uphill Slalom -- Wearing leather-soled shoes, and carryinga large paper bag full of groceries, contestants would weavethrough a series of pylons staggered along an icy sidewalkthat measures 220 meters (about 1/8 mile, or the length of atypical city block) and that angles uphill at a grade of noless than 25 degrees. This event was inspired by myadventures reaching my hotel in the little town ofBrides-les-Bains, except the driveway there is punctuated bypotholes instead of pylons, and I usually carry a computerbag instead of groceries.                                                                                                          Dressage II -- Competitors would dress a two-year-oldchild from the skin out for a cold-day walk. Garments wouldinclude socks, underwear, shirt, pants or skirt, shoes,overshoes, leggings, coat, cap and scarf wrapped securelyacross the face. To ensure fairness, the two-year-olds wouldbe assigned by random draw. Judges' ratings would supplementclockings, with a rapid dressing of a docile child countingless than a somewhat-slower performance with a balky one. Achild's refusal to go out once he or she had been dressedwould result in the competitor's disqualification.                                                                                                          Alpine Combo -- Contestants would negotiate amedium-difficult ski run shared with recreational skiers,repair to a lodge for two stiff hot toddies, and make abathroom stop. Then they'd stand in a lift line and make therun again. Scoring would be weighted, with times of thesecond run counting for more than those of the first. There'dbe penalties for knocking over or verbally abusingrecreational skiers.                                                                                                          Commuter Marathon -- Utilizing the major city nearest tothe main Olympic venue, competitors would begin 26 miles and385 yards from a downtown-officebuilding destination. They'dnegotiate rush-hour traffic on a morning with at least threeinches of new snow, find a legal parking place (it'd be OK touse a lot) and walk or run the remaining distance. First onethrough the revolving doors wins.   I will take the earliest opportunity to address thiscolumn to Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of theInternational Olympic Committee. I'm sure that many of mysuggestions will be adopted by the next Winter Games, atLillehammer, Norway, two years hence. If you pick yourspecialty now, you'll have plenty of time to train.</TEXT></DOC>
