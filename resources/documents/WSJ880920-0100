With his televised announcement that he will &quot;resign according to the results of the referendum,&quot; Prime Minister Turgut Ozal has transformed a referendum on holding local elections four months early -- a minor issue -- into a referendum on his leadership. By putting the continuation of his five-year reign on the line, Mr. Ozal apparently hopes to change enough minds before Sunday's referendum.    A resignation by Mr. Ozal would threaten stability not only in Turkey but the region. Turkey, whose neighbors include Iran, Iraq, Syria and the Soviet Union, is the West's closest ally in the Eastern Mediterranean and second only to the U.S. in its supply of troops to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Under Mr. Ozal, elected to his second term last year, the country has moved steadily to align itself with Europe and the U.S. Mr. Ozal generally is applauded in the West for his democratic political and economic free-market reforms.    Mr. Ozal's threat, apparently made after consultations only with his family, took Turkey and even his Motherland Party by surprise. Party officials described the speech as a &quot;shock,&quot; and said their executive members will hold an emergency meeting tomorrow. In a statement yesterday, the president of Turkey's leading business organization said the country &quot;will gain renewed political instability and the economy will be thrown into chaos&quot; if Mr. Ozal resigns.    But Western diplomats noted that the prime minister was unspecific about exactly what &quot;referendum results&quot; would lead to a resignation, leaving himself some maneuvering room if the referendum loss isn't a big one. &quot;Whatever happens on Sunday, {Mr. Ozal's} Motherland Party will still have a two-thirds majority in Parliament on Monday morning,&quot; said one. &quot;There is no legal reason he won't continue in office.&quot;    The referendum ostensibly is over a relatively minor issue: Whether the constitution will be changed to allow Parliament to advance the date of local elections to November from next March. But the increasingly strained economy is the real issue, making it possible for opponents successfully to cast the referendum as a vote of confidence in the Ozal government.    With inflation in Turkey at 78%, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development last week said reducing it &quot;has to be the overriding priority for policy&quot; in Turkey. Foreign debt exceeds $40 billion. The government already imposed several price increases this year, and the Turkish lira declined 57% against the dollar since Jan. 1.    Mr. Ozal, who has called the referendum a &quot;test for democracy&quot; and says constitutional changes should be made by the people, argues that the country's economy can't afford to be in an &quot;election atmosphere&quot; into 1989. It's &quot;inevitable,&quot; he said last week in a newspaper interview, that the local elections, whenever they're held, will have &quot;negative effects on inflation.&quot; Turkey held elections in 1986 and 1987, with substantial government spending preceding each.    Out-of-control inflation also could trigger another military intervention into government. The army has intervened in Turkish politics three times in the past three decades, each time citing inflation and economic decline as the reason.    Now, to regain control of inflation, Mr. Ozal sharply must curtail growth and take measures that markedly will increase hardships for Turks over the next several months. Though the local elections won't include parliamentary deputies, the increasing economic squeeze nevertheless is certain to bring some backlash against the government when voters across Turkey choose their mayors and provincial representatives.    A big loss in the local elections could result in shifting party alliances, perhaps threatening the Motherland Party's twothirds majority in Parliament. Economic conditions are likely to get worse before they get better, thus Mr. Ozal's preference for early elections.    The magic number for next weekend's referendum appears to be 36%, the level of popular vote Mr. Ozal won in last year's general election. For weeks, it has been clear that the government would lose the referendum, leading Mr. Ozal to indicate he would consider the loss acceptable if he matches his previous 36%.    But even that has looked increasingly difficult. A poll published by Milliyet newspaper Saturday showed 60.7% of the voters will vote against the government, with 25.3% voting for it and 13.9% undecided but leaning toward a &quot;no&quot; vote. After Mr. Ozal threatened to resign, Erdal Inonu, leader of the biggest opposition party, called Mr. Ozal's resignation threat an &quot;election ploy&quot; to swing the undecided into his camp, and many newspapers agreed.    ---   Metin Demirsar in Istanbul, Turkey, contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
