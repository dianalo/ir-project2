White   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>02/14/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1</SO><CO>   GM JCI</CO><IN>AUTOMOBILES (AUT)AUTO PARTS AND EQUIPMENT INCLUDING TIRES (AUP)</IN><LP>   DETROIT -- Less than five months into its launch, GeneralMotors Corp.'s Saturn subsidiary is recalling almost 30% ofthe cars it has sold to fix front seats that could lurch backunexpectedly.   Saturn says the defect doesn't pose a safety hazard andhasn't caused any accidents. Nonetheless, the recall isanother setback for GM's $3.5 billion effort to luresmall-car buyers away from Japanese vehicles. The recallaffects 1,210 of the 4,049 cars Saturn has sold since Oct.25, and another 270 cars on dealer lots.</LP><TEXT>   Even before the recall, consumer response to Saturn waslukewarm. As of Feb. 10, Saturn had sold 4,049 of the 10,000cars it has built since last summer at its Spring Hill,Tenn., factory.   Saturn officials say they're building 250 cars a day. Butin the past 40 days, Saturns have sold at an average rate ofjust 58 cars a day. As of Jan. 31, Saturn had built up an81-day supply of cars. Ideally, auto makers want no more thana 60-to-65-day supply on hand.   Saturn officials have been attributing their slow sales tothe auto industry's overall slump and to their own &quot;modelmix&quot; problem. Specifically, they say dealers have too manytop-of-the-line Saturn SL-2 sedans, which sell for up to$14,000, and not enough Saturn SL-1 sedans with automatictransmissions that sell for about $10,000.   There have been too few SL-1 automatics partly because theearly production models tended to shake too much when idlingat a stop, Donald Hudler, head of Saturn's sales andmarketing operations, acknowledges. That problem has beenfixed, and production of SL-1 automatics is now increasing,he adds.   What impact the recall will have on Saturn's efforts isn'tclear. Saturn officials have said time and again that anyblemish on the quality image of their plastic-bodied carswould seriously undermine their efforts to persuadeimport-oriented consumers that this new GM product is a safebuy. &quot;We're going to take the time it takes to do it right,&quot;Saturn President Richard G. &quot;Skip&quot; LeFauve told an audienceat the Chicago Auto Show last week when asked why productionat Spring Hill has accelerated so slowly.   Recalls don't necessarily do long-term damage toconsumers' perceptions of quality, however. In late 1989,Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus luxury division recalled all 8,000of the highly touted LS 400 sedans sold at the time to fixthree problems, including sticky cruise control mechanismsthat stayed on after drivers turned them off and defectivecenter-rear brake lights. Both of those defects posed safetyhazards.   But Toyota moved swiftly to fix the problems -- evensending mechanics to LS 400 owners' homes. The car went on tosell strongly throughout 1990 and win rave reviews for itsquality and performance. (Lexus LS 400 sales have stumbledsince Jan. 1, reflecting the overall industry slump.)   &quot;We decided a year and a half ago that we wanted to takethe Lexus approach&quot; to handling a recall, Mr. Hudler says.The hope, he adds, is that Saturn's aggressive tactics willgenerate &quot;a lot of good word of mouth, just like Lexus did.&quot;   As part of its damage control effort, Saturn sent lettersthis week by Federal Express not only to owners of cars thatcould have defective seats but also to owners whose carsaren't affected but might hear about the recall. On Tuesday,Saturn officials briefed dealers by closed circuittelevision, Mr. Hudler said.   In its letters to Saturn owners whose cars are beingrecalled, the division says the seats &quot;might slip a notch ortwo.&quot; If the problem isn't fixed, the letter continues, &quot;itcould gradually slip back even a few more notches . . . so,of course, you'll want to get this repaired right away.&quot;   A Saturn spokesman says the division found out about theseat problem in November and has been working since then totrack down defective cars and get repair parts to dealers. Hesays Saturn knows of 19 customers who have experiencedtrouble.   In a departure from auto industry custom, Saturn named themanufacturer of the defective seats, Hyperion Corp., a jointventure of Johnson Controls Inc. and Tachi-S, a Japanesecompany. A Hyperion spokeswoman says the defective parts willtake about an hour to repair.   Saturn will make repairs free of charge to owners.</TEXT></DOC>
