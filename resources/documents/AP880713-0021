The Iranian gunboats were firing at the 81,282-ton UniversalMonarch, which signaled at about 11:30 a.m. EDT Tuesday that it``was being attacked and was on fire,'' said Defense Departmentspokesman Dan Howard.   A Lamps Mk III surveillance helicopter from the guided-missilefrigate USS Nicholas plus two attack helicopters responded to theMayday call, said Lt. Col. David Titus, a spokesman for U.S.Central Command in Tampa, headquarters for American forces in thegulf.   ``As the armed helicopters approached the Universal Monarch, twosmall boats were seen departing the area,'' said Titus. ``The boatsfired at the helicopters at approximately 12 noon EDT and thehelicopters returned their fire with rockets and machine gun fire.   ``It is believed one of the boats was damaged. There was nodamage to the helicopters and no U.S. casualties. The UniversalMonarch suffered some hull, engine and and fire damage. Nocasualties were reported and the ship required no furtherassistance, acording to its master.''   Pentagon spokesmen declined to identify the attack helicopters,but it was believed they were Army AH-6's, flown by SpecialOperations Forces attached to the U.S. fleet in the gulf andoperated from specially outfitted barges.   The incident happened in the northern Persian Gulf, 23 nauticalmiles west northwest of Farsi Island, which has been used by Iran'sRevolutionary Guards to launch attacks by small boats againstneutral shipping in the gulf.   The London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit said theUniversal Monarch is owned by a Hong Kong company and managed bythe Japanese company Tokudo Shasen K.K., of Tokyo.   The vessel, flying a Panamanian flag, was sailing empty to pickup cargo from the Khafji fields, owned jointly by Kuwait and SaudiArabia, according to shipping executives in the gulf who spoke oncondition they not be identified by name.   Howard said that, ``to my knowledge, this is the first suchexchange since the incident of (July) the third,'' when the USSVincennes mistakenly shot down an Iran Air jetliner, killing all290 people aboard.   Since the Vincennes incident, Iran has attacked two commercialvessels _ the Norwegian-owned tanker Berge Strand and theRomanian-owned freighter Plataresti.   In the ``tanker war'' that is an offshoot of the 8-year-oldIran-Iraq war, Iran attacks neutral shipping in the gulf inretaliation for Iraqi raids on its oil tankers.   Last Thursday, Iraqi warplanes raided two supertankers in thevicinity of Iran's Kharg Island oil terminal at the northeasternend of the gulf. The Greek-owned 264,108-ton Fellowship L and theCypriot 215,780-ton Star Ray were set afire, but no casualties werereported.   The Iranian ship attacks have continued despite a broadened rolefor U.S. Navy warships in the gulf, enabling them to protectcommercial vessels even if they do not fly the Stars and Stripes.   In another development, the Pentagon announced the completion ofthe 46th U.S. convoy through the gulf, as the USS Robert G. Bradleyfinished escorting the reflagged Kuwaiti tanker Townsend tointernational waters off Kuwait at about 7:40 a.m. EDT Tuesday.   The Bradley and the Nicholas are Oliver Hazard Perry-classguided missile frigates.</TEXT></DOC>
