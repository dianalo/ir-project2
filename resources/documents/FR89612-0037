Based on this assessment and following consultationwith the Department of Defense, the Department of Commerce has found foreignavailability for machine-vision systems operating at the following parameters:(a) Image analysis rate of 3.3 images per second; (b) Pixel resolutionof 65,536 (256andmultiply;256); and (c) Two hundred and fifty-six shadesof gray.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Maurice Cook, Office of ForeignAvailability, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, Telephone:(202) 377-8074.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Availability Determination</ITAG>The Office of Foreign Availability has completed an assessment on the foreignavailability of low-level machine-vision systems that are controlled ascomputer ``related equipment'' in paragraph (h) of ECCN 1565A, operatingat the following parameters: (a) Image analysis rate of 3.3 images persecond; (b) Pixel resolution of 65,536 (256andmultiply;256); and (c) Twohundred and fifty-six shades of gray.The purpose of the assessment was to determine whether national securityexport controls should be continued. The Office of Foreign Availabilityhas completed an assessment of the availability from foreign sources ofthe above mentioned equipment and has recommended a finding of foreignavailability as defined by law. Based on such assessment and recommendation,I hereby determine that foreign availability of such equipment exists withinthe meaning of section 5(f) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, asamended.Based on this determination, the Bureau of Export Administration is publishingregulations in the Rules section of this <T4>Federal Register</T4> to amend the national security export controlson these low-level machine-vision systems that are controlled under ECCN1565A(h) by removing the individual validated license requirement to destinationsin Country Groups T and V, except the People's Republic of China and Afghanistan.The Bureau of Export Administration also will begin the process wherebythe United States Government will work with Coordinating Committee (COCOM)member governments to reach agreement on an orderly change in the multilateralcontrols maintained on such low-level machine-vision systems when exportedto controlled countries.If the Office of Foreign Availability receives substantive new evidenceaffecting this foreign availability determination, the assessment willbe reevaluated. Inquiries concerning the scope of this assessment may bedirected to the Office of Foreign Availability at the above address.This assessment also considered the foreign availability of low-level machine-visionsystems that were then controlled under ECCN 1391(a)(1). The positive findingrecommended by the assessment made a very significant contribution to thedecontrol of ``robot sensors'' under that ECCN, which was agreed to byCOCOM. Regulations implementing the decontrol were published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 15, 1988 (53 FR 35799).<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 7, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James M.
