The private study, released Wednesday by the CongressionalEconomic Leadership Institute, said direct foreign investment inthe United States has jumped by more than 215 percent since 1980,while American investment abroad increased by only one-fifth thatrate.   And the study said the pace of foreign investment is expected toaccelerate, with foreign buyouts in 1988 expected to make up asmuch as 20 percent of all U.S. acquisitions, up from 5 percent in1987.   However, the report said that in absolute terms, foreigninvestments still account for only 5 percent to 6 percent of totalU.S. assets.   The study said seven nations account for nearly 85 percent ofthe foreign investment in the United States. They are Britain, with$75 billion in cumulative investments by 1987; the Netherlands, $47billion; Japan, $33 billion; Canada, $22 billion; West Germany, $20billion; Switzerland, $14 billion; and France, $10 billion.   Other findings include:   _Foreign investors now own 10 percent of the U.S. manufacturingbase, with majority interest in the concrete and consumerelectronics industries and significant portions of machine tools,chemicals and auto parts.   _Most foreign outlays in the United States are to acquireexisting businesses rather than to establish new ones.   _Jobs of nearly 3 million Americans are dependent on foreigninvestment, up from just 1.1 million 10 years ago. Foreignaffiliates account for 7 percent of U.S. manufacturing jobs.   _More than 25 percent of all commercial and industrial loans inthe United States are owed to foreign banks.   _More than 12.5 million acres of farm land in 49 states areowned by foreigners, about 1 percent of the U.S. total.   The study was compiled with data from the U.S. CommerceDepartment and other sources. The institute is a privateorganization founded in 1987 to act as a forum on economic policyfor lawmakers and business, labor and educational leaders.</TEXT></DOC>
