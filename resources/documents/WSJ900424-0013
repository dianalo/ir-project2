Indeed, New York has no statute expresslyfor the recovery of stolen art, only an idiosyncratic muddleof case law. Clarity, however, may be just around the corner.The state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, now has anopportunity to define the law, in a ruling expected afterLabor Day.   Just last year, a New York Supreme Court judge (thestate's lowest judicial level) rebuffed the Solomon R.Guggenheim Museum, saying it could not sue to recover aChagall gouache from Mrs. Jules Lubell because, since thework's disappearance in the mid-1960s, the museum had takenno action to report or recover it. But the Guggenheim isback, having taken its case to the Appellate Division, whosefive judges decided unanimously in late January that themuseum's inaction should not prohibit it from bringing suit.The Appellate Division's opinion said such cases should bedetermined neither by statutes of limitations nor by tests ofdue diligence, but rather by a court deciding whether bothparties had behaved reasonably at the time. Mrs. Lubell thenasked to have the Court of Appeals rule on the question, andon March 29, despite the unanimity of the intermediate court,it was decided that the highest court would do so.</LP><TEXT>   Litigation to recover stolen art is not rare. Right now inNew York, the Republic of Turkey is waiting to hear if itssuit against the Metropolitan Museum of Art, claimingownership of the Lydian Hoard, more than 200 works of ancientsilver, will be heard. The Netherlands is suing New Yorkdeveloper and art collector Ian Woodner to get a Hans BaldungGrien drawing it contends was in a collection stolen by theNazis.   Earlier this year, Lebanon and Yugoslavia each asked a NewYork court to freeze Sotheby's proposed sale of the SevsoTreasure, a magnificent group of late Roman silver reportedlypurchased by the Marquess of Northampton in Switzerland inthe 1970s. The treasure is said to have an export licensefrom Lebanon, but Yugoslavia's papers assert that thetreasure was excavated in the early '70s near Pula in theYugoslavian province of Istria, where the Sevso family wasprominent, that its export was illegal, and that Yugoslaviantitle to the silver is superior to any other.   The New York Court of Appeals ruling will affect not onlythe suits currently under consideration, but the behavior ofpeople in the art market. Every day, situations crop up inwhich people require legal counsel, as they contemplateacquiring works without provenance or decide whether or notto return works of art requested by original owners.   A Connecticut man came in to IFAR to inquire whether a17th-century English clock he'd bought at an antique shop inValhalla, N.Y., had been stolen; we informed him that aManhattan dealer had reported the theft of one that appearedto be identical in 1977. The clock now is worth upward of$200,000, and attorneys for the two parties are negotiating.   A private art dealer recently called IFAR's Art TheftArchive to see if the beautiful Chagall oil painting he wasbeing offered was hot. He didn't know the sellers, and theprice was too low, he believed; &quot;I'm not that lucky,&quot; he toldus. He wasn't. The painting had been stolen in Baltimore in1970. Its current value is more than $1 million. Lawyers havearranged the return.   Civil suits are much more common than criminal actions incases of art theft. But April 30 is the trial date forMadison Avenue art dealer Michael Weisbrod, who is accused ofbuying two Chinese porcelains and an 18th-century pink coralcarving knowing they were stolen.   The thieves had robbed museums in Detroit, Columbus, Ohio,Albany, N.Y., Syracuse, N.Y., Boston and Baltimore ofdecorative-arts items including a silver Tiffany pitcher; aceramic masterpiece of 1910, Adelaide Alsop Robineau's&quot;Scarab Vase&quot;; the Chinese porcelains; and a group of Englishantique pocket watches. They were caught after an attempt tosell the watches. Mr. Weisbrod's attorney, Richard Berne,told IFAR that he and his client are &quot;confident that he willbe exonerated.&quot;   ---   Ms. Lowenthal is executive director of the InternationalFoundation for Art Research (IFAR).</TEXT></DOC>
