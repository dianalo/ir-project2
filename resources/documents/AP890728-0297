U.S. District Judge Harold Greene said enough competition existsin the transmission and provision of so-called electronicpublishing services to allow ATandamp;T to enter the fields on Aug. 24.   ATandamp;T in April had asked Greene to revoke the ban, which was inthe form of a consent decree imposed when ATandamp;T divested itself ofits local phone companies in 1984.   The 1984 judgment stipulated that the electronic publishing banwould be lifted in seven years unless shown it should continue. Theban was established Aug. 24, 1982, and Greene, who oversaw the ATandamp;Tbreakup, said he intended to lift it after seven years.   Greene said the ban was appropriate in 1982 because theelectronic publishing industry was in its infancy and ATandamp;T had defacto control of the long-distance network.   But he said the ban should operate only ``for the periodnecessary to establish conditions conducive to free and faircompetition.''   After seven years had passed, Greene said, the burden of proofwould be on any opponents of removal to show that competitiveconditions clearly required maintaining a ban.   ATandamp;T in April argued that the electronic publishing industry washealthy and had significant competition in long-distance from MCICommunications Corp., US Sprint Communications Co. and others. ATandamp;Tcontrols about 68 percent of the nation's long-distance business.   ATandamp;T said major electronic publishing companies includedKnight-Ridder Inc. for online database services; Citicorp, DowJones and Reuters for securities quotations and financialinformation; Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp. and TRW Inc. for credit data;and General Electric Co., International Business Machines Corp. andSears andamp; Roebuck Inc. for videotex services.   ``No one has contradicted the thrust of these contentions, andno one is contending that current competitive conditions warrantretention of the electronic publishing restriction in itsentirety,'' Greene said in his ruling.   He noted the Justice Department had decided that ATandamp;T could notexert ``bottleneck'' control over long-distance services because ofits competitors. The Federal Communications Commission concludedthe same thing, Greene said.   ATandamp;T said the decision reflected Greene's ``thoroughunderstanding of forces at work in today's highly competitive andcomplex telecommunications marketplace.''   ATandamp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the company would not comment onwhat electronic business business options it was considering.   ATandamp;T said in April it had no plans to enter the electronicyellow pages and television businesses _ two areas of specialconcern to the seven regional Bell telephone companies spun offfrom ATandamp;T in 1984 and to the broadcast and cable TV industries.   Some observers, noting some major failures by companiesattempting to develop a U.S. videotex market, have said ATandamp;T maynot rush into the electronic publishing business immediately.   But electronic yellow pages may be an area of interest to ATandamp;Tsince the regional Bell companies are barred from that business.   In 1987, Greene gave the regional Bell companies permission totransmit but not originate information services, which includeelectronic publishing and data processing and related computerservices.   Replying to ATandamp;T's April filing, several companies requestedthat ATandamp;T be prohibited from providing audiotex and data processingservices because it could dominate this infant industry.   But Greene said sufficient competition exists in thetransmission of audiotex services and he had no antitrust authorityto assist relatively small or weak audiotex providers.   Greene also said he was not deterred by assertions by theAmerican Newspaper Publishers Association, Consumer Federation ofAmerica and an audiotex provider, Omnicall, that independentproviders are hampered because they can't switch long-distancecarriers and keep their 800 or 900 numbers.</TEXT></DOC>
