U.S. warplanes provided air cover for loyal forces and appearedFriday to have turned the tide against mutinous soldiers who hadseemed close to toppling the nearly 4-year-old administration ofPresident Aquino.   In attempts to overthrow the government in January 1987 andagain the following August, mutineers tried to seize Villamor AirBase and the naval air station at Sangley Point. They failed. Thistime, they succeeded.   Seizing those two installations gave the mutineers access toaircraft, enabling them to rocket and strafe the presidentialpalace and two major military targets and to knock out the onlygovernment television station that was broadcasting Friday.   With an airfield, the rebels could also fly their ownreinforcements quickly from areas of southeastern Luzon andMindanao, where opposition to the government is strong.   By noon, the rebels had blasted Malacanang Palace twice and CampCrame, headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary, and CampAguinaldo, headquarters of the armed forces, a total of six times.   The psychological impact was great. Presidential staff memberscontacted by telephone panicked. The attacks cut Mrs. Aquino offfrom her people. One attack knocked off the air the only operatingTV station, depriving her of her conduit to the people.   Rebel sources, contacted at the height of the attacks, said theywere convinced of victory and were simply waiting for Mrs. Aquinoto resign. All that changed with U.S. intervention.   Mrs. Aquino said the government decided to ask for U.S. militarysupport by noon, when her situation appeared desperate. Thepresence of U.S. Air Force F-4 fighter-bombers put an end to rebelair raids.   During the lull, Philippine F-5 jets raided Sangley Point anddestroyed the planes that had attacked the palace.   The halt in air operations also gave the government time to rushin reinforcements from nearby regions of central and southern LuzonIsland, where commanders were loyal to Mrs. Aquino.   When the coup attempt was launched early Friday, it appearedthat the government could count on relatively few troops based inthe capital.   Reporters saw few pro-government checkpoints or patrols on thestreets during the crucial, early hours of the coup attempt, whenthe rebels were rushing units into the capital.   At Fort Bonifacio, headquarters of the Philippine army, militaryChief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said the situation was a``standoff,'' with pro- and anti-government units equally matched.   Philippine marines, on the other hand, spearheaded the rebeltakeover of Villamor. Ironically, the marine detachment wasreinforced after the August 1987 coup attempt because the commanddoubted the loyalty of the army. It brought additional marine unitsfrom the southern Philippines because of their supposed discipline.   But the appearance of U.S. warplanes in the skies upset themutineers' timetable. Rebel units heading for the capital stoppedfor hours, apparently confused over the implications ofWashington's action.   By the time they resumed heading for Manila, the government hadreinforced its garrison with loyal troops.   Late Friday, a rebel spokesman condemned the American move as``an act of aggression against the sovereign Filipino people.''</TEXT></DOC>
