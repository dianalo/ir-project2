In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Hawley said debt incurred from the $52-a-share acquisition would be repaid from funds generated internally by ADT or from &quot;other sources,&quot; which may include proceeds of the sale of debt or equity securities, or the sale of assets.    Both ADT and London-based Hawley are electronic security systems concerns.    William Halpin, ADT vice president, administration, and secretary, said he knew of no specific planned sale of assets. &quot;I think this is boilerplate language&quot; designed to cover any possible contingency, he said. &quot;We are very happy with the (acquisition) agreement,&quot; he added.    Hawley expects to begin its tender offer for ADT this week. </TEXT></DOC>
