Barry Blechman, an arms-control expert at the Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute, says that's just flat wrong. The largest conceivable cuts in nuclear, conventional and naval forces over the next 10 years, he calculates, would yield, at best, $60 billion -- and more likely a small fraction of that. The Pentagon, he says, would adopt expensive alternatives that would eat up the savings from arms control.    Remember the &quot;missile gap&quot; of the 1960s? Welcome to the analysis gap of the 1990s. While Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev appears to have a plan, experts in the West are in the midst of a free-for-all over the tricky, seldom-explored questions of the social, economic and political costs of gearing down for peace.    &quot;There is no place in NATO {the North Atlantic Treaty Organization} that thinks about the post-arms-control environment,&quot; despairs Uwe Nerlich, director of research for West Germany's Foundation for Science and Politics. &quot;We have left it to the left wing and the Russians to do that.&quot;    The West's side of the puzzle, according to Mr. Nerlich, is more difficult because businessmen and politicians are running way ahead of events. It is months, if not years, before the first conventional-arms deal, yet the U.S. defense industry is already in the midst of rapid shrinkage, and defense budgets in the U.S. and Europe are under siege.    Most analysts do agree on one point: The economic impact of the defense-industry shakeout will be severe. A study by Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies says 80,000 U.S. companies, most of them small or middle-sized, have dropped out of the defense business over a five-year period.    A follow-up survey of 41 top defense contractors by the center shows that almost half are planning to switch more of their production effort into civilian goods. Ninety percent of the companies blamed the declining defense budget.    The Bush administration's efforts to accelerate the pace of the conventional-arms talks in Vienna mean that answers must soon be found for a number of knotty &quot;peace&quot; questions currently under dispute among the experts. Here are some other examples:    Question: How should the government manage the decline of the defense industry?    &quot;There is going to be a lot of political maneuvering,&quot; says Robert Costello, former undersecretary of defense for acquisition, &quot;because you're going to wind up with somebody in DOD {the Department of Defense} to decide which company goes out of business.&quot;    The politics will pit one region against another. For example, Mr. Shulman and William Kaufmann, an analyst for Washington's Brookings Institution, agree that there could be regional depressions in places like Southern California, Massachusetts, Texas, northern Virginia and other places where the defense industry is clustered.    Mr. Shulman asserts that the impending fallout of skilled technicians and scientists from the defense industry will be a boon to companies in other areas, such as in Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois. The influx of talent, he says, will lead to better civilian goods that can sell abroad. Mr. Kaufmann, though, says that &quot;is probably a myth.&quot;    &quot;You don't convert a guy from a defense job automatically into being a marvelous designer of refrigerators,&quot; he says. &quot;I know of no thought being given to how you would make use of these allegedly multitalented people from defense industries.&quot;    The Defense Department, Mr. Kaufmann says, must intervene to protect key parts of the defense industry from being dismantled, especially its high-technology and research-and-development components. &quot;This can't be left entirely up to the market.&quot;    John Lehman, former Navy secretary, says that &quot;is baloney,&quot; adding, &quot;I don't buy the argument that the Pentagon's role is to preserve the industrial base.&quot; Mr. Lehman predicts that &quot;you're going to see a lot of companies close, merge or peel off divisions.&quot;    Mr. Lehman has seen the problem from peculiar vantage points. He led the Reagan-era defense buildup by promoting the 600-ship Navy. Now he is managing director for corporate financing at PaineWebber, where he hopes to be in the middle of many defense-industry mergers.    Question: What is the best way to handle the costs of bringing troops home?    Mr. Lehman says the best way is to convert as much as one-third of active forces into reserve forces, a move that many politicians in Washington see as inevitable. The cost of withdrawing U.S. troops stationed in Europe -- where they often live in subsidized facilities -- and building new bases for them here will run into the billions; hence the lure of cycling units into the reserves.    Such a restructuring would mean, over time, that any succeeding war would be much different from Vietnam. It would mean that to fight, a post-arms-control Army would have to mobilize the butcher, the baker and, perhaps, even the girl next door.    This thought makes some experts queasy. &quot;The problem with the guard and reserve is that if you say anything bad about them you are accused of being unpatriotic,&quot; says Lawrence Korb, a former assistant secretary of defense for manpower and reserve affairs. &quot;The fact is that their level of aptitude across the board is not as good as it should be. The modern Army has some fairly sophisticated things to work with. This is no longer a job for Willie and Joe and the Doughboys.&quot;    &quot;What you would get is lower capability and lower readiness for less cost,&quot; asserts Robert Pirie, an analyst for Rand Corp., who also formerly dealt with reserve matters in the Pentagon.    Question: What will a U.S. soldier fight with in the new era of the 1990s?    Gen. Edward Meyer, a former Army chief of staff, believes that instead of buying more aircraft and tanks that will be increasingly costly, the services should use this period of uncertainty to invest in robot tanks, high-technology unmanned aircraft and more-sophisticated electronics. The result would be lighter, cheaper, more-capable weapons, says Gen. Meyer.    &quot;All of these areas are going to have a tremendous impact on what the {nation's military} force will look like in the year 2000,&quot; he says. &quot;So there is a big business out there for industry.&quot;    John O'Brien, chairman of Grumman Corp., says Gen. Meyer's vision is improbable. &quot;I don't think we'll get there in my lifetime.&quot; In a future war, Mr. O'Brien believes, the Navy will rely heavily on F-14D fighters that will be made by Grumman.    The saga of the F-14D is a signal that Congress may not be ready for any new era. Under heavy pressure from lobbyists, the House ignored the Bush administration's effort to kill the program. Unlike weapons of an earlier era, which were often made in one or two plants, the $45 million to $75 million fighter (depending on how many are purchased) is a flying national public-works project. Pieces of it, according to Grumman, are made in 49 of the 50 states.    Norman Augustine, chairman of Martin Marietta Corp. and a former Pentagon official, worries about what will happen if this process continues. If the price of new fighter planes continues to increase by a factor of four each decade, he says the Pentagon will have to further shrink the size of its air units. Mr. Augustine says one way to stop the phenomenon from unilaterally disarming the Pentagon will be to upgrade older airplanes, which may have to fly 30 years or longer. Martin Marietta manufactures electronics and other systems that can be fitted on older aircraft.    Question: Which military service will get the biggest budget in a post-arms-control world?    Geoffrey Bentley, head of the defense-market forecasting committee for the Electronic Industries Association, says it has to be the Navy, which will need more ships to carry military equipment back to Europe in the event of a crisis. &quot;If you want to buy a stock for widows and orphans, it's the Navy,&quot; he asserts.    It's the Army, says Phillip Karber, senior vice president for BDM Corp. The &quot;enforcer&quot; of any agreement that withdraws troops and weapons from Europe will be the U.S. Army, he argues. The Army must be able to reinforce Europe quickly in time of a crisis.    Fast ships crossing the Atlantic might be safer if they went individually, rather than in protected World War II convoys, he reasons, especially if the Soviet Union decides to scrap much of its navy. Since the U.S. Navy has traditionally focused its budget on warships and not on ships to carry men and equipment, Mr. Karber suggests that the Pentagon could set up a new agency to lease such transports.    Meanwhile, he says, the Navy's budgets would be eaten up by expensive maintenance bills for the idle warships.    ---@ Shrinkage of U.S. Defense Industry @ Number of weapon suppliers @ 1982 1986 @ Ground Vehicles 3,497 1,280 @ Ships 2,602 488 @ Aerospace 17,907 3,550 @ Ordnance 5,601 2,663 @ Source: Center for Strategic andamp; International Studies. </TEXT></DOC>
