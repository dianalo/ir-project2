In the latest disturbance, three nights of violence followed theJan. 16 shooting of black motorcyclist Clement Lloyd by Miami policeOfficer William Lozano. Lloyd's passenger, Allan Blanchard, died ofinjuries from the ensuing crash.   In the riots that followed, one man was killed, 13 buildings wereburned and many businesses were looted.   A week after the shooting, the Colombian-born Lozano was arrestedand charged with two counts of manslaughter.   The speed with which he was charged was astonishing compared withprevious cases _ so much so that Lozano's attorney, along with aColombian business group and the local police union president,accused prosecutors of acting with unseemly haste to quiet the blackcommunity.   ``We did not look at any kind of pacification, satisfaction,''said Miami Police Chief Perry Anderson, who is black. ``We looked atwhat we had to do as professional law enforcement investigators.''   To many blacks, however, the relatively mild charges and the low$10,000 bail for Lozano seem like the familiar beginning of arecurring tragedy.   Metro-Dade officers were acquitted in May 1980 of the beatingdeath the previous December of black insurance agent ArthurMcDuffie, sparking an uprising in which 18 people died. In March1984, a Hispanic Miami policeman was acquitted of killing NevellJohnson in a video arcade in December 1982. His death also causeddisturbances, although police moved quickly to stem protests afterthe verdict.   ``I just want to know why policemen have so many protectionshields around them,'' said the Rev. Richard Barry, who heads aspecial review board empaneled by the city to investigate the latestcase. ``They have the Fraternal Order of Police, the policeman'sbill of rights _ and if they have that much protection, how do youget to them?''   Barry's committee, set up with much fanfare just as the riotssubsided, discovered at its first meeting that although the CityCommission gave it subpoena power, state law and competing criminalinvestigations prevented key witnesses from testifying.   Most investigations of police misconduct proceed at a glacialpace.   Two cases that didn't involve black victims show the moreleisurely pace of police abuse investigations.   One month before Lloyd was shot in Miami's black Overtownsection, six members of Miami's elite street narcotics squad wererelieved of duty after allegedly beating an unarmed man to death inhis home. That investigation continues, and no one has been charged.   A month before that, a Miami officer's gun went off during atraffic stop, killing the motorist. No resolution has been reachedin that case, either.   While the police internal security division handles routinecomplaints, State Attorney Janet Reno's office has responsibilityfor cases that may involve criminal charges.   Her policy, intended to de-politicize sensitive cases, tends todrag out the process, many blacks say. It requires that chargesagainst an officer be filed only after presentation of evidence in aspecial hearing before a judge.   ``If there is a question mark, we take it to an inquest,'' shesaid.   Critics say there always seem to be question marks when policeare involved.   ``The police get together and corroborate each other's storiesand grill independent witnesses, looking for the smallestinconsistency. It's a whitewash,'' said Fakir.   He said some cases have stalled in the state attorney's officefor up to two years. In those cases where charges are brought, theresults have been less than satisfactory to blacks.   Under a law popularly called the policeman's bill of rights,officers in conservative, pro-police Florida can have representationat all levels of disciplinary hearings, and complaints against themmust be held confidential for 60 days.   Miami police say they investigate every complaint, as well asgenerating their own investigations. Twenty-nine policeman have beendismissed in the past four years, said Maj. Calvin Ross, newlyappointed head of the internal security office.   Twenty-five officers are on leave with pay, routine procedure forofficers who use their firearms or are accused of seriousinfractions. Most outstanding cases involve accusations of excessiveforce or extreme acts of abuse, Ross said.   In 1988, the department received 503 official complaints, each ofwhich can include more than one officer. Forty percent were deemedunfounded, 24 percent substantiated and 36 percent ``inconclusive,''which Ross admits is a frustrating category.   ``If there's a one-on-one situation ... it's very difficult todetermine if the allegation occurred as the complainant said,'' Rosssaid. ``That doesn't always sit just right with the complainant.''</TEXT></DOC>
