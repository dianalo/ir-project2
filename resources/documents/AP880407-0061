Paul Simon puts his campaign on hold. Michael Dukakisand Albert Gore, meanwhile, zeroed in on Mideast issues, seen as alikely sore spot for Jesse Jackson in the upcoming New York primary.   Simon, who has lost everywhere except in his home state ofIllinois, scheduled a Capitol Hill news conference to talk abouthis campaign future. Aides said he was suspending the campaign, butstopping short of dropping out.   The three remaining active Democrats were all campaigning todayin New York, which holds its primary April 19. At stake are 255delegates, in what will be the biggest state contest to date.   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, in an interview published today, saidhe is unlikely to make an endorsement before the primary. And hewarned the Democrats _ singling out Gore _ that negativecampaigning is ``terribly dangerous.''   On the Republican side, there was plenty of parley: VicePresident George Bush, the nominee in all but name, met Wednesdaywith former rival Sen. Bob Dole, who pledged to work to get Bushelected. And Dole talked with Pat Robertson, who remains in theRepublican race although he concedes he has little chance of beingnominated.   Simon's decision to suspend campaigning ``reflects the realityof having lost a great many primaries and caucuses,'' saidspokesman Terry Michael, adding that by remaining in the race hewould give his supporters a voice at the convention.   Simon's mother, Ruth, said her son would remain an officialcandidate, if not an active one. ``He's going to hang in there tillthe end,'' she said.   Simon made his last stand in Wisconsin, where he finished a weakfourth in Tuesday's primary. The Illinois senator ran second in theleadoff Iowa caucuses on Feb. 8, in what was to be his best showingof the campaign outside of his home state.   After finishing third in New Hampshire a week later, he did nothave enough money to campaign actively for the round of contests onSuper Tuesday, March 8, and was consequently clobbered.   Many expected him to drop out after that, but Simon, underpressure from Illinois supporters, stayed in for his home-stateprimary, then said his victory there was enough reason to remain inthe race.   For the other Democrats, the battle of New York began in earneston Wednesday. Dukakis was at work courting voters in New York'slarge Jewish community, stressing the need for a Mideast peace planthat would allow Israel to ``live in peace and harmony.''   Gore reiterated his strong support for Israel as he campaignedWednesday in New York City. He said as president, he would create aCabinet-level position to focus full-time on Mideast negotiations.Gore also blasted Dukakis and Jackson for a lack of experience ininternational affairs.   Cuomo decried such infighting, saying his admonition wasdirected mainly at Gore.   ``It does not work, and it's terribly dangerous andcounterproductive in a primary where one of you will be thenominee,'' he said in an interview with The Washington Post.   Cuomo, seen by some Democrats as a potential draftee in theevent of a deadlocked convention, said he preferred to wait untilafter the primary season to make an endorsement.   ``That's the time for leadership in this process,'' the governorsaid.   Jackson was campaigning in New York today, after spending a dayin Arizona, which holds Democratic caucuses on April 16, andIndiana, where primary day is May 3. In Indianapolis, Jackson wasasked how he expected to do among New York's Jewish voters.   ``You'll never get all of any one group,'' he said. ``All youcan do is reach out. I've reached out and I'm glad to see peopleare responding.''   Many Jews were offended by Jackson's 1984 reference to New Yorkas ``Hymietown'' _ for which he apologized _ and his associationwith Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan, who called Judaism a ``gutterreligion.'' Jackson no longer has ties to Farrakhan, his campaignsays.   Jackson has made numerous efforts to mend fences with the Jewishcommunity.   After three straight wins _ in Connecticut, Colorado andWisconsin _ Dukakis was leading in the national delegate race. Thelatest AP count put him at 740.55, Jackson at 704.55, uncommittedat 513.6, Gore at 394.8 and Simon at 170.5   Even if he is not actively campaigning, Simon could continue togain delegates, and keep those he has. That would leave him incontrol of a delegate bloc that could give him some clout at theDemocratic National Convention.   Whether he meant it to or not, Simon's decision to technicallyremain a candidate helps Dukakis remain the leader in the delegaterace.   Under party rules, Simon is entitled to 47 at-large delegatesfrom Illinois, Jackson to 13 and Dukakis none. A Simon withdrawalwould automatically shift his 47 delegates to Jackson's column, andthus put him ahead in national delegate count.   Meanwhile, Dukakis widened his margin of victory over Jackson inMonday's Colorado caucuses. Returns on Tuesday showed Dukakis hadnarrowly won. On Wednesday, with 85 percent of the precinctsreporting, Dukakis had widened his lead to 11 percentage points, 45to 34 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
