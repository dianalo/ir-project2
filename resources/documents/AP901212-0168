More than 6,000 local governments have filed challenges sayingthe census was inaccurate. They include all of the 51 largestcities.   ``Virtually everybody's count will go up,'' Bryant said.   New York Mayor David Dinkins and William Althaus, mayor of York,Pa., scheduled a meeting with Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacherto discuss correcting the count in major cities. The mayorsrepresent the U.S. Conference of Mayors.   Bryant and Michael Darby, under secretary of commerce foreconomic affairs, said the newly counted people were found throughfive programs designed to check the census' accuracy.   The Census Bureau compared its count against parole andprobation records; asked people to come forward if they weremissed; sent workers to recanvass some households that mailed informs to check the accuracy of the forms; sent canvassers to countpeople in households that had not mailed a form back and checkedvacant and uninhabitable housing to see if someone lived thereafter all.   Officials refused to say exactly how many people had been addedsince the April 1 count. They would say only how many people orhouseholds had been checked under the programs and what percentagehad produced additions to the census.   Bryant said the bureau checked 1.2 million parole and probationrecords and found 34 percent should be aded to the initial count.That's about 408,000 people.   Most parolees and probationers are men in their 20s and 30s, thebureau said.   The bureau's ``Were You Counted'' program asked people tocontact the bureau if they thought they hadn't been counted. Nearly166,000 responses produced additions to the census count, accordingto Bryant's figures. Some responses may have added more than oneperson.   Also:   -Workers found at least 125,000 missed households throughrecanvassing.   -Nearly 46,000 households thought to be vacant were found tohave residents.   -Workers found people living in nearly 9,000 houses that werethought to be uninhabitable.   The newly counted people will be added to the preliminary U.S.population count of 245.8 million.   Census numbers are used to determine how many representatives astate sends to Congress and how federal aid is divided among thestates.</TEXT></DOC>
