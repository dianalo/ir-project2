A. Barr submitted a petitionto NHTSA concerning the devices which connect tractors and trailers. Accordingto the petitioner, present designs of the kingpin on trailers and the lockof the fifth wheel of tractors make it possible for the driver to obtainwhat is called a ``high hitch,'' or false latch, when the tractor is connectedto a trailer. Mr. Barr stated that if a high hitch occurs, the trailermay separate from the tractor during highway driving. According to thepetitioner, the accidents which have occurred from high hitches are notfrequent, but usually are very serious when an automobile strikes an uncontrolledtrailer which has separated from a tractor.Mr. Barr characterized his petition as one requesting the agency to commencea proceeding to determine whether to issue an order concerning notificationand remedy of a defect in equipment that relates to motor vehicle safety.The petitioner requested that NHTSA ``require an SAE standard for the kingpinwhich will not permit a high hitch.'' The petitioner stated that this mayalso mean changes to the fifth wheel locks. Mr. Barr stated that one possibleapproach would be to make the bottom diameter of the kingpin larger thanthe diameter of the recess in the lock so that the hinge lock cannot beclosed if the bottom of the kingpin is placed in the recess during thehitching process. Since Mr. Barr requested a ``standard'' to prevent high hitches, NHTSAis treating the petition as one for rulemaking. The agency notes that itdoes not issue ``SAE standards,'' but instead issues Federal motor vehiclesafety standards, pursuant to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle SafetyAct. SAE standards are voluntary standards, published by the Society ofAutomotive Engineers (SAE).As part of its efforts to evaluate Mr. Barr's petition, NHTSA contactedseveral manufacturers of fifth wheels about high hitches. The agency wasadvised by some manufacturer representatives that it is possible to falselatch most of the designs on the market. It was generally contended, however,that it is the responsibility of the truck driver to conduct an inspectionto ensure a proper connection. NHTSA believes, based on discussions withheavy truck fleet managers, that a typical estimate for high hitches isabout two or three per year for a fleet of one thousand trucks, and thatmost separations occur before the truck reaches the public highway.NHTSA understands that at least one fifth wheel design, produced by FontaineTruck Equipment Company, was designed to prevent high hitches. The agencybelieves that the design does not cost more than other fifth wheel designs.NHTSA also analyzed available accident data. The agency recently completeda study in which six years of accident data collected by the Office ofMotor Carriers (OMC, formerly the Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety or BMCS)were screened for accidents related to coupling defects. The data showedcoupling defects involved in 353 out of 188,836 accidents. Forty-threeof the 353 fell in the categories of accidents which were preceded by semi-trailerseparation or of accidents which may have been preceded by semi-trailerseparation.Two studies published in 1985 and 1986 by the University of Michigan TransportationResearch Institute, based upon a combination of FARS and OMC data, showedtractor-trailer separation as a primary cause of the accident in 0.24 percentof the accidents studied. However, some of the accidents were not relatedto fifth wheels.After evaluating Mr. Barr's petition, NHTSA has concluded that there isa reasonable possibility that the order requested in the petition willbe issued at the conclusion of a rulemaking proceeding. The agency thereforegrants the petition. The accident data cited above indicate that high hitchesdo not result in a large number of accidents. However, the separation ofa trailer from a tractor during highway driving could result in seriousconsequences. NHTSA believes that this may be an area where safety benefitscould be obtained by low cost design changes.In order to obtain assistance in conducting further analysis of the safetyissues related to high hitches, this notice requests public comments. Thenotice is being issued jointly with FHWA, since some of the issues relateto the possible regulation of vehicles currently in use as well as newlymanufactured vehicles. (NHTSA's standards apply only to new vehicles, whileFHWA's standards apply to vehicles in use.) NHTSA and FHWA are particularlyinterested in comments on the following questions:1. What information is available about separation of tractors and trailersduring driving, both on-the-highway and before the combination reachesthe highway? What are the causes of such separations? What is the frequencyof high hitches?2. What information, including data and accident analyses, is availableconcerning accidents caused by separation of tractors and trailers duringdriving? How many of these separations are attributable to high hitches?3. How can kingpins and fifth wheels be designed to prevent high hitches?What current designs of kingpins and fifth wheels prevent high hitches?What changes would be needed to other designs to prevent high hitches?Do current patents present any limitations in making such changes? Whatwould be the costs of redesigns needed to prevent high hitches?4. Should NHTSA develop requirements to prevent high hitches? What typesof tests and performance requirements should be considered by the agencyif it develops such requirements? Should such requirements address bothkingpins and fifth wheels?5. Should a possible requirement for preventing high hitches be applicableto vehicles currently in use as well as to newly manufactured vehicles?How could current vehicles be retrofitted to prevent high hitches? Whatwould be the cost of retrofitting current vehicles to prevent high hitches?The granting of this petition does not mean that a rule will necessarilybe issued. The determination of whether to issue a rule is made in thecourse of the rulemaking proceeding, in accordance with statutory criteria.Interested persons are invited to submit comments.
