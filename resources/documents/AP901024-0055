(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A train derailed on tracks washed out byfloodwaters and knocked down a highway overpass, and twoautomobiles fell into the gap. One person died.   Stormy weather Tuesday also proved perilous to motorists inNorth Carolina. A road in Randolph County was washed out, leaving ahouse-size hole into which two vehicles drove. Both drivers wereseriously injured.   North Carolina had at least two tornadoes and record rain - 4.23inches in six hours - that swelled rivers to flood stage, theNational Weather Service said. No injuries were reported from thetwisters.   In Orangeburg, S.C., flooding washed out rail supports andcaused four coal-filled train cars to derail and hit a highwayoverpass above the tracks, Highway Department spokesman Sam McCuensaid.   The bridge collapsed, and two automobiles plunged into thechasm, killing one person and injuring two others, McCuen said.   Another highway bridge washed out about five miles away and onecar drove through, injuring two people.   In Asheboro, N.C., at least 6 inches of rain left a30-foot-long, 20-foot-deep hole in a road, and two vehicles fellin. One driver was hospitalized in critical condition, the other inserious condition.   ``It was scary, very scary,'' said Linda Hicks, co-owner of thewrecking service that towed one of the vehicles out of the pit.``This was a first for me, and I hope and pray this is the last. Itwas a bad scene.''</TEXT></DOC>
