Karr (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LABOR </CO><G> LBR </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Labor Department proposed rules designed to protect employees while they are repairing potentially dangerous equipment.    The rules have been under development for a decade. The delay was among those cited during a Senate Labor Committee hearing last month as evidence that the Reagan administration has held back several department plans for workplace health and safety requirements.    Under the proposed &quot;lockout/tagout&quot; standard, employers would have to take steps to ensure that powered machines cannot be turned on when maintenance or servicing work is being done. Switches must have warning tags attached or the main power must be turned off, for instance, and workers must be trained to prevent unintentional start-ups of the equipment.    The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the department unit issuing the proposal, said it would save an estimated 122 lives and prevent 60,000 injuries a year. OSHA said it would cost employers about $212 million the first year and $135 million annually thereafter.    Control of &quot;hazardous energy sources&quot; is already required as a part of several OSHA standards, the agency said, covering such equipment as powered industrial trucks, cranes, power presses, forging machines and sawmills. But the proposal, covering general industry, would create uniform procedures for applying the lockout/tagout rules, OSHA said.    OSHA chief John Pendergrass said 7% of workplace deaths are caused by failure to restrain or de-energize equipment during maintenance. Some 39 million workers would be protected, with three million at greatest risk from the hazards, OSHA said.    Employers would be given &quot;maximum flexibility&quot; in meeting the standard, Mr. Pendergrass said.    The proposed standard doesn't include oil- and gas-well drilling, electric utilities and work on electric conductors and equipment, for which specific lockout/tagout procedures are being developed, OSHA said. It also said future rule making will cover agriculture, maritime and construction employers. The public will be given until June 28 to submit comments and hearing requests.    During the recent hearings led by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), James Scully, who was an OSHA mechanical-safety specialist, testified that Reagan administration officials delayed and sought to limit the scope of the lockout/tagout standard, which he had worked on. In the meantime, he said, the lack of such a standard has caused 150 deaths a year.    He was one of 10 OSHA scientists and field inspectors who testified about such delays and other alleged agency failings. Mr. Scully, who had said he would retire when the lockout/tagout standard was issued, retired last Thursday, the day before the OSHA proposal was announced.    Eileen Paumier, an Ohio woman, said in dramatic testimony that her husband was killed while doing maintenance in an elevator shaft at an Akron foundry. She said that someone turned on the power, sending the elevator upward, crushing her husband against the top of the shaft. Mrs. Paumier blamed OSHA for the tragedy.    Franklin Mirer, health and safety director for the United Auto Workers, said that &quot;energy lockout&quot; is the union's leading safety issue. After the proposal was issued, Mr. Mirer said the flexibility that OSHA intends to allow could make the standard ineffective. Even &quot;taking this one-quarter step forward&quot; reflects pressure from the Kennedy hearing, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
