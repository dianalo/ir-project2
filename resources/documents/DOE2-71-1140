Calculations of spin-spin splittings and absolutevalues of masses were conducted for the large number of S-wave q/sup2/q/sup -2/-mesons in the framework of nonrelativistic potential modelsand bag model. The revealed disagreement in calculation results, relatedto different models, is explained by insufficient account of relativisticeffects in nonrelativistic approach or by inexact knowledge about qq(qq-bar)-forces.10 refs.; 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
