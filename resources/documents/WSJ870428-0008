The Bonn government and the central bank withheld official comment yesterday. But West German government sources have been widely cited in the local media as saying that the decision has been made.    Mr. Poehl's reappointment has been widely expected, although the chancellor was believed at one point to have considered naming a member of his own Christian Democratic Party to the top monetary post. Mr. Poehl belongs to the left-wing Social Democratic Party, or SPD. He was appointed to his first term as central bank president in 1980 by the SPD-led government of then-Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.    Under Mr. Poehl's leadership, the Bundesbank charted a monetary policy that led West Germany out of the 1981-82 recession and eliminated inflation by last year, albeit with the aid of plummeting world oil prices. Mr. Poehl has jousted with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, whose apparent tactic last year of talking the dollar down to improve the U.S. trade position was branded by Mr. Poehl as &quot;playing with fire.&quot;    Mr. Poehl also hasn't shied from putting public pressure on his own government. After the cut in West Germany's discount rate to 3% from 3.5% last January, the central bank chief openly declared that it was Bonn's turn to take fiscal steps that would stimulate the German economy. </TEXT></DOC>
