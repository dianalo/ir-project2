 Email tends to bemisunderstood, pigeonholed into a way to send and receive lunchdates and interoffice memos.andP;  True email has the ability totransfer a wide variety of information from one user to anotherand can be made quite secure.andP;  Unfortunately, standards are rareand different email packages do not tend to work well together.andO;As the industry moves towards a more standardized base, provisionsfor the integration of email systems will take place.andP;

 It sounds like asilly question.andP;  In fact, a lot of users don't consider the variousadditional productivity gains that networking can bring.andM;Whoever in the company decided to install a network will have chosen thesolution for one of three reasons.andP;  One, there's an application that everyoneuses which would benefit from a centralized data store.andP;  Two, there's afrequent need to share or move data from one user to another.andP;  Three, theythought a network was a good idea.andM;Whether your system is a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network(WAN), one of the features that many users don't fully exploit is electronicmail (email).andM;Email has the potential to provide a method of integrating all your internaland external communications, applications and data stores.andP;  More importantly,it could do it now.andM;Sticking for the moment with electronic mail within the confines of a LAN;how do you access it and what can it do that a phone call can't?andP;  To theformer, most LAN operating systems used to come bundled with a perfectlyusable email program.andP;  It was then discovered that a fairly high proportionof LANers didn't actually use this feature and those that did wereenthusiasts.andP;  Enthusiasts, in the eyes of the seller, mean an opportunity togenerate a little more income by selling email as an option.andM;An email message doesn't have to be just an invite to lunch or the latestcompany prospectus.andP;  Instead it can contain any type of information -- andit's possible to send it even when the recipient isn't there.andM;How about sending queries to a remote database or swapping images generatedby a VAX minicomputer with your spreadsheet files?andP;  All that's needed is astandard method for the electronic mail systems on each hardware platform totalk to each other: transferring such diverse file types across not only asimple LAN, but also across a WAN, perhaps made up of LANs based on differentoperating systems and machines.andM;The original emailandM;One of the burdens that email carries with it is an image of littleinter-office memos sent by an unfriendly mail program or, worse still, viaTelecom Gold.andP;  Once users have got rid of this image, then email will becomeas useful as it should be.andM;'Real' electronic mail is just a method of transferring information; the mailpostfix has had the effect of pigeon-holing this technology for the wronguse.andM;At the moment there are two main users of electronic mail: LAN-based users,sending messages about the network, and users of a public service.andP;  Thesepublic services vary both in power and user-friendliness.andP;  They range fromPrestel, which has an easy-to-use frontend, to CIX, which has gateways to theJANET (the Joint Academic Network that links all universities) and BritishTelecom's PSS service, to Telecom Gold which has a very off-puttinguser-interface but more in the way of PSS links.andP;  All these are'host-centric' mail services in that all the messages are dealt with by onehost, although they can, if pushed, send messages on.andP;  This type of serviceis good for remote salesmen, home-workers and the like -- though a remotelink to the LAN at headquarters would be more effective.andM;Of the many problems with electronic mail, the most pressing, to my mind, areusers' attitudes to its capabilities, the way it's used and security.andP;  Thecapabilities of a system are, to a large extent, governed by, and dependenton, the subscribers.andM;As in the case of the telephone system: now everyone has a telephone it's aconvenient and usually easy way to reach who you want.andP;  Once a highproportion of computer users can be contacted by an email address, then it'llsuddenly pick up.andP;  The problems of providing such a wide ranging service foreveryone from a PC to a mini user depends on getting a decent standard setup.andP;  There's one at the moment, MHS, and I'll describe it and itsimplications in more detail a little later.andM;As I've mentioned, attitudes to how email should be used must be addressed:it isn't at all uncommon for someone who's been away for a month or so to logon and try to download all their mail.andP;  Regrets begin when the 4Mb worththat's accumulated, along with reports and so on, has to be downloaded at1,200 baud.andM;Another common misunderstanding is that email will create the paperlessoffice.andP;  It won't.andP;  As an example, if you mail a note to a manager, it isn'tuncommon for their secretary to retrieve all email, print it out, hand it tothem -- since they're comfortable with paper and the dancing green lights ofa VDU are still relatively alien -- then enter a hand-written reply from theboss.andP;  This is a bit silly.andM;Another potential problem is enunciation.andP;  If you're talking, there isn'tusually too much problem understanding what's going on.andP;  When keying emailmessages, this inflection is often forgotten.andP;  Hence, a message from the bossto a salesman asking for a presentation might well have been intercepted byhis secretary -- who will have drafted a rapid acknowledgement that 'weresent the message'.andP;  That's re-sent, not resent.andP;  One is correct, the otherwill get you the sack.andM;The last point is that of security.andP;  This is a very sensitive area and userscan generally be grouped into the under-informed or the ill-informed.andP;  If youintend to send confidential messages around, using a message-host availableto the public, then there's a chance they'll get intercepted.andP;  I don't liketo say it, but the chances are normally provided by careless users.andP;  It caneasily happen if you use an unchanging password, a password that's three orfour characters long or one that's blatantly obvious.andP;  There are otherprecautions, for instance you could encrypt your text then send it as abinary file.andP;  Most services allow an attached file to be sent.andM;If the basic rules for the use of a mailbox are based on those of your letterbox at home your electronic mail will be pretty well secure.andP;  By this I meanyou don't make copies of your front-door keys and give them to friends.andM;These points are still using the premise that electronic mail is just anelectronic version of the basic postal service -- it's not.andP;  You can send adisk in an envelope, why not as a mail message?andP;  Standards for this serviceare rare -- indeed there's really just one that's caught on: Novell's MessageHandling Service.andM;Message Handling ServiceandM;Consider, for the moment, an example in which a user already has a local areanetwork up and running and wants to send a message from their workstation toanother user.andP;  To take the simplest case first, we'll assume that therecipient is a valid user within the LAN.andM;The order of events is quite straightforward; the sender calls the emailprogram, types in the text of the message, enters the name of the recipientand exits.andP;  The mail program has a number of ways of storing this message,and one would be to save the message text as a file in the recipient's uniquedirectory, write an entry confirming delivery in the sender's directory andfinally, set a 'mail-available' flag for the recipient.andM;To clear this up, say the sender is called JOE and the recipient MIKE.andP;  Atthe end of the process, a file containing the message would be in a directorycalled MAIL\MIKE and the entry saying that the message had been deliveredwould be in MAIL\JOE.andM;Once MIKE has been told that there's new mail (by the 'mail-available' flag)he could run the mail program, see a list of files within his directory andread the most recent.andP;  After he's read the message, the entry in MAIL\JOEwould be modified to say delivered and read.andM;Of course, there are various ways of doing all this, depending on the mailprogram.andP;  This is just a simple example that I've outlined and it can beeasily improved upon for both disk space consumed and speed.andM;The potential for problems is considerable.andP;  Perhaps the majority of users onthe network use one integrated package, like Framework III, which has emailcapabilities and stores the files within a particular format.andP;  What happensif someone uses another mail program?andP;  The answer is, not a lot.andM;Say, however, that MIKE is on a different network to JOE, but there's agateway between them.andP;  For added excitement, let's say that the two differentnetworks are using different operating systems.andP;  How can a mail program onone server be expected to talk intelligently to that on the other?andP;  Theanswer, of course, is a standard.andP;  The most popular, if unofficial one, iscalled MHS -- Message Handling Service.andM;MHS was developed a little while ago by Action Technologies and Novell (andis now owned lock, stock and code by Novell).andP;  It is, as a gentleman fromNovell put it, 'the only standard of its kind in the PC world'.andP;  This is astrong statement, but it's pretty accurate.andM;The Message Handling Service uses a technology known as store and forward.andO;This does as its name implies and stores messages until ready to send them onto their relevant destinations.andP;  Store and forward is a compromise solutionto a problem that won't, for the moment, go away.andP;  If you have a number ofremote sites then to link them permanently costs money -- lots of it.andP;  Toestablish a link between each site only when there's enough data to send in achunk is far less expensive.andP;  It does, though, mean that real-time, criticalinformation will be delayed.andM;MHS is a platform whose services can be called by any sort of application.andO;The application doesn't deal at all with the actual sending or storing ofmessages -- all that's left to the MHS host process (it's usually implementedas a value-added process within a network) -- instead it communicates withthe MHS process by means of a set software interface.andM;The Message Handling Service platform is itself split into two parts: theConnectivity Manager and the Transport Server.andP;  These have two distinct jobs.andO;The Connectivity Manager itself has two tasks -- it looks after the messagequeues waiting to be sent and it works out the route the message has to take.andM;Once a message in the queue has had its routing information sorted out, it'spassed on to the Transport Manager, which has but one job.andP;  That's toestablish the link according to the routing information and transmit themessage to the receiver's Transport Manager, which stores it in the relevantMHS directory, ready to be dealt with by the receiver's Connectivity Manager.andM;The routing information is set up on installation and, within the list,describes not only how to send a message from one workstation to anotherwithin the same network, but also how to call a remote location's MHS toprovide a gateway between networks.andM;Programming interfacesandM;The MHS system provides applications -- and their writers -- with two ways ofusing its services.andP;  These two Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) arethe Message Control Block (MCB) and the Standard Message Format (SMF).andM;Using the MCB interface is the simplest route to develop an application thatwill support MHS, but the SMF interface provides more features, such asmultiple recipients and access to different character encoding methods fordifferent computers (for example, how to send an ASCII file to an operatingsystem that uses EBCDIC).andM;Both APIs use the same basic format, and applications that create messagesbased using either API are interchangeable, though the extra information ofthe SMF API isn't available to a MCB-based application.andP;  I'll stick with theMCB interface for clarity's sake, since it's simpler.andM;Using the MCB API, all the relevant details are contained within an 18-linetext-based header file.andP;  The majority of these header entries are created bythe calling application.andP;  This 18-line header contains such details as thename of the originator and recipient, their relevant locations andworkgroups, and the name of any additional file being sent and the type offile being sent.andM;There are also guidelines set down for the type of file sent, be it formattedword processed text, graphics or an image.andP;  These guidelines are actuallybased on the most popular applications rather than 'ideals' and so areusable, unlike some other communication standards which I could mention.andM;To create such a text-based header is no effort for an application, hence theattraction of MHS to programmers.andP;  The file containing this semi-completedheader is then passed on to the MHS platform.andP;  In normal circumstances, thisis achieved by calling an ancillary program, SEAL.EXE, which packages theheader ready for the MHS and calls the Connectivity Manager.andM;The MHS then takes over, filling in the extra details in the MCB header --such as serial numbers and time stamping.andP;  This leaves the originalapplication free to continue with other tasks.andM;Meanwhile, the routing path will have been constructed by the ConnectivityManager and the whole header, the message and any additional files will havebeen passed on to the Transport Server.andP;  The actual connection is thenestablished between the Transport Servers of the sending and receiving MHSsand the queued messages transmitted.andM;The receiving Connectivity Manager moves the newly arrived message into thecorrect user's directory.andP;  The final step at the receiving end is foranother, complementary, program, UNSEAL.EXE, to be run.andP;  This is done everynow and then at the request of the receiver's application program anddelivers the message in correct MCB API format accordingly.andM;All this might appear to be a massive overhead to transmit a simple message.andO;It is, but that's the price for a system that works and is standard acrossdifferent machines and applications.andP;  Besides, since the main work is done bythe MHS platform which is implemented as a VAP -- and so works in thebackground -- it won't get in the way.andM;In point of fact, the MHS host program does not, strictly, have to beinstalled, especially if the communications are just over a single local areanetwork.andP;  This means more work for the applications generating the messages,but they will, normally, still use the same format and so can continue tocommunicate.andP;  This is hardly ideal, but it's a start if your LAN is small andthe traffic through it isn't heavy enough to warrant installing a value-addedprocess such as email.andM;In useandM;A fair number of applications currently use the MHS standard, includingFramework III (for the electronic mail facilities it integrates with itsother functions), cc:Mail, Higgins, and Coordinator 2 -- all mailapplications.andP;  Other email programs stick to the various in-house standardsset by manufacturers of hardware platforms, operating systems and, indeed,anyone else who believes that their system is the best.andM;The disadvantage of the current implementation of MHS is that a PC-basedserver is required to run the software, though this is due to be expanded onto other server platforms -- including the VAX minicomputer.andP;  (Otherplatforms can currently be used to store the messages, but not to actuallyrun the program from).andM;The advantages start when you consider electronic mail as a method of sendinginformation rather than just 'textual' mail.andP;  The message sent could be aquery to a remote database -- probably in SQL (structured query language) foradded compatibility -- the answer to which would then come back along thesame MHS route.andP;  This provides a suitable method of implementing adistributed processing system within otherwise incompatible hardware andsoftware.andM;If you've a large company that generates a lot of email, more than a smallPC-based server could handle and archive, then a VAX minicomputer could beused as the storage place for all the information -- as directed by thePC-based MHS host.andP;  Or, more realistically, a mini-based centralized datastore could be accessed from any LAN-bound PC using a suitable front-end togenerate the queries and send them through the MHS platform.andM;This standard, then, has the potential to create a situation in which anyconforming email application sends a query to a centralized database,receives the figures, sends them on to a mainframe number-crunching programwhich sends them back as a Lotus 1-2-3 file.andP;  This can then be usedimmediately, without conversion.andM;The provision for integration between applications is already in place --several dozen formats are currently defined, from Telex to WordStar to dBaseto PC Paintbrush.andP;  This means that even though the hardware used to transmita message might be incompatible -- until ISDN is fully implemented -- there'sa definite way for electronic mail programs to communicate meaningfully.andO;Perhaps electronic information transfer would be a better description and itwould help get over the bulletin-board image that email has acquired.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
