Automation, remote control androbotics have taken an added significance. Wireless communication, mine-wideequipment health and performance monitoring, and transmission of datafrom deeper levels to surface is moving towards becoming the norm. Thereis emphasis on developing and applying continuous mining systems, aswell as on modifying cyclical discontinuous methods to continuous systems.Multi-purpose equipment is also being developed. Technology transferis playing its role - equipment and systems from surface coal miningare being applied to underground mining and vice-versa. At the AmericanMining Congress Exhibition held in Chicago in April 1988, a variety ofequipment for underground mining was displayed including coal face equipmentsuch as shearer loaders, conveyors and powered supports, and equipmentfor room-and-pillar coal mining. The trend continues to be towards highpower machines equipped with a variety of electronics and sensors, safetydevices, and alarm systems. Ancillary equipment on display covered avariety of cutting drums, cutting tools, conveying equipment and so on.In room-and-pillar mining, the overall emphasis was on moving away fromthe cyclical nature of the work. Transportation by shuttle cars mustbe replaced by continuous transport systems such as conveyors. Experiencefrom Australia has shown that the application of continuous haulage andbreaker line supports has permitted a doubling of production from room-and-pillarsystems. Production levels of 3,000tpd have already been achieved, and4,000tpd is considered achievable.</TEXT></DOC>
