However, during the 1920s the world began switchingsteadily from coal to oil, especially for transport. During the nexthalf century, the dominant role in the energy market passed from Europeand North America to the Gulf. The path of inflation and of depressionor economic growth has been heavily influenced by the price of oil whichhas also dominated the development decline of other energies and is likelyto continue to do so during the next decade or two. The energy markethas some special characteristics. Firstly, the supply of the producton a vast scale is essential to modern life. Secondly, prices withinthe market are remarkably volatile, and thirdly, the crucial investmentsare large and long term. Because of these special characteristics andthe inevitable monopoly in the energy utlities, the privatisation philosophyis more difficult to apply to the energy sector than to other industries.The British government must place emphasis on security of supply, recognisingthat diversities of sources and national energy security apply to coaland to North Sea oil and gas as well as to the nuclear. It must alsorecognise the merit of long-term contracts and look after competitivenessand moderate prices without giving too much weight to the short-termor to spot prices. The coal industry is more vulnerable than most toprice volatility and the long term character of investments.</TEXT></DOC>
