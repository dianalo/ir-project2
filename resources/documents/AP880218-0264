Gary Lynch, SEC enforcement director and one of the architectsbehind an aggressive campaign against Wall Street corruption, wasquoted as saying in an interview that the prospect of imprisonment,civil fines and financial ruin is convincing some people ``it'sbetter to hunker down than cooperate.''   It was unclear from Lynch's remarks whether he was suggestingless stringent sanctions against insider trading, the illicit useof nonpublic information to profit in securities transactions.   Lynch spoke to ``The Wall Street Journal Report,'' a weeklytelevision program of business and financial news produced by DowJones andamp; Co., publisher of the Wall Street Journal.   The company released a partial transcript of his remarks, to bebroadcast this Sunday, one year since the Feb. 20, 1987 sentencingof Dennis B. Levine, a former investment banker whose arrest formassive insider trading infractions spawned a widespread federalinvestigation.   Levine, who cooperated with the government, was forced torelinquish $11.6 million in illicit profits. He received a criminalpunishment of two years imprisonment and a $362,000 fine.   ``We're getting less cooperation today,'' Lynch was quoted assaying in response to a question about what has changed in the pastyear that has made the investigation easier or more difficult.   ``More people are asserting their fifth amendment rights and notcooperating,'' he was quoted as saying. ``So we're not able to askbasic questions about contact, and that's certainly theirconstitutional right, but it does make it more difficult to puttogether information for an investigation.''   Asked for further explanation, Lynch was quoted as saying: ``Itwas one thing when people had to be concerned about a civil actionby the SEC and perhaps the disgorgement of money.   ``It's another thing, when you talk about putting them out ofbusiness completely and, not getting disgorgement of profits, but acivil penalty as well and then subjecting them to the possibilityof time in federal prison. So, add it all up and some lawyers areadvising their clients: It's better to hunker down than cooperate.''   Lynch was traveling abroad until Monday and unavailable tocomment about the interview, his office said.   SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue, who didn't attend the interview,said ``I've heard Gary say before that there is more hunkeringdown, so I would not dispute that, but I don't know if I would makethat the greatest news release that ever hit the pike.''   Levine's cooperation led investigators to Ivan F. Boesky, onceone of Wall Street's most powerful stock speculators. He paid arecord $100 million to settle civil charges of insider trading inNovember 1986 and was sentenced to a three-year criminal term lastDecember.   Although Boesky and Levine are said to have implicated a numberof other Wall Street professionals in illegal activity, there havebeen no significant arrests in the past year.</TEXT></DOC>
