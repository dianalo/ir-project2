Gorbachev said Tuesdaythat the superpowers should renounce military intervention in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean and make the region a zone of peace.   Addressing the Cuban National Assembly, he also emphasized thatSoviet-style reforms are not a universal remedy for other communistcountries, including Cuba.   ``We do not regard our approaches and solutions as someuniversal prescription for all,'' he said in what appeared anattempt to minimize the difference between Cuba's orthodoxcommunism and Gorbachev's new pragmatism.   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union opposes the ``export ofrevolution or counterrevolution,'' referring to both Cuban and U.S.policy in Latin America.   But he also reaffirmed that the Soviet Union will continuesupplying weaponry to Nicaragua's leftist government as long as theUnited States continues to arm other Central American countries.   The issue remains a major sore point in relations betweenWashington and Moscow.   In Washington, President Bush and Secretary of State James A.Baker III both said they had not had a chance to review Gorbachev'sspeech. But Baker said his comment on Nicaragua was ``the same oldline they've been pushing.''   There had been speculation that Gorbachev, in a gesture offriendship toward Cuba, might announce forgiveness of part or allof Cuba's debt to the Soviet Union.   But he barely mentioned the subject, merely restating hisposition that the industrialized nations of the world should try tohelp ease the burden of debtor nations in the developing world.   Cuban President Fidel Castro, in a 50-minute introduction thatwas only three minutes shorter than his guest's address, lambastedthe United States in a characteristic diatribe. He blamed hislongtime adversary for regional conflicts throughout the world andfor ``pulling the Third World's leg'' by proposing unworkablesolutions to the critical problem of Third World debt.   Waving his arms and jabbing his fingers, the 62-year-old Castrorejected suggestions of friction in Soviet-Cuban relations. He saidhe was in full agreement with Gorbachev's contention that eachcommunist country must solve the problems of developing socialismin its own way.   Gorbachev, who had been expected to outline Soviet policy towardLatin America, essentially reiterated his government's longstandingview that the United States holds the key to peace in CentralAmerica and must halt its intervention in order to encouragesettlement of regional strife.   ``We have a real possiblity of guaranteeing peace,'' he said,but all sides must halt military supplies to the region.   ``The Soviet Union does not seek for itself political, strategicor military advantage in the Western hemisphere,'' Gorbachev said.``We consider that this hemisphere and all others must not be anarena for East-West confrontation.''   In proposing establishment of a ``zone of peace,'' the Sovietpresident said his country ``does not have any intention of havingin Latin America naval, air or missile bases or to place therenuclear or other weapons of mass extermination.''   He called on the United States and other countries to adopt asimilar approach to continue the transformation of Latin Americainto a region of peace, security and stability.   The Soviet Union and Cuba are principal suppliers of theSandinista regime in Nicaragua and leftist guerrillas in ElSalvador. The United States provides nonmilitary aid to Nicaragua'sContra rebels and weaponry to the Salvadoran government, Hondurasand other nations.   Soviet sources predicted before Gorbachev left Moscow that theSoviet leader would try to persuade Castro to extract Cuba frominvolvement in leftist struggles around the world and concentrateon building the Cuban economy, which after three decades ofsocialism is still heavily reliant on Soviet aid.   ``We are resolutely opposed to any theories and doctrinesjustifying the export of revolution or counterrevolution, all formsof foreign interference in the affairs of sovereign states,''Gorbachev said in his speech.   He made similar statements after the speech at a newsconference, saying that ``power policies have totally disceditedthemselves.''   Earlier, in an interview with the Soviet news agency Tass,Gorbachev suggested that he and Castro are prepared to work forimproved East-West relations, indicating some softening in theCuban leader's rigid anti-Americanism.   Gorbachev told Tass a central topic of his talks with Castro onMonday was the ``new thinking'' in Soviet foreign policy _ anapproach that seeks to ease world tensions by reducing militarycommitments abroad and negotiating settlements of regional disputesthat threaten to bring the superpowers into conflict.   It is a tenet of Gorbachev's reform policies at home that theSoviet Union must demonstrate to the West it is eager to serve as acooperative partner in world economic development and dispel theKremlin's ``enemy image'' of the Cold War era.   Castro and Gorbachev signed a 25-year accord the Cuban newsagency Prensa Latina said dashes all speculation about a riftbetween Havana and Moscow and ratifies their ``traditionalrelations.''   But despite a show of friendship between he two communistallies, a series of arrests in Havana on Tuesday underscored thedifferences between the pragmatic liberalism espoused by Gorbachevand the tight control still exercised by Castro 30 years after heled a guerrilla army to victory over a right-wing dictatorship.   Police rounded up seven dissidents who were planning ademonstration Tuesday evening in support of Gorbachev's reforms.Among those detained was Samuel Martinez Lara, leader of thePro-Human Rights Party, according to government and dissidentspokesmen.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwilercondemned the arrests, saying they underscore ``the need forongoing monitoring of the human rights situation in Cuba.''</TEXT></DOC>
