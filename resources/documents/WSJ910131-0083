Lilly, which said it will acquire an equity stake in theParamus, N.J., company, purchased the exclusive world-widelicense to Neurogenetic's genetically engineered versions ofthe human neurotransmitter known as serotonin.</LP><TEXT>   Terms of the pact weren't disclosed. While the agreementwith Lilly marks the first commercial partnershipNeurogenetic has formed, the small company made it clear thatit will seek further links with other drug makers, and willpush forward with its own research.   Nerve cells are turned on and off by chemical messengers,known as neurotransmitters, that fit into receptors.Knowledge of how those receptors are activated, manyscientists think, may help in development of drugs to controlmigraine headaches, depression and anxiety.   Lilly's big-selling Prozac anti-depressant works byslowing brain cells' intake of serotonin, for example.Research into that family of neurotransmitters is beingpursued by a number of drug companies.   Neurogenetic makes genetically engineered receptors, whichcan speed such research by allowing scientists to directlyobserve how a potential drug will affect the desired receptorwithout time-consuming tests on animal tissue.   Lilly, Neurogenetic said, will fund research &quot;directed atintegrating these cloned receptors into ongoing serotoninresearch efforts at Lilly.&quot; Under the agreement, Neurogeneticwill receive royalties on sales of any Lilly products thatcome out of the collaboration.   Neurogenetic, which said &quot;several&quot; drug makers have askedit to consider cloning specific so-called peptide receptors,will &quot;choose one partner for a collaboration in this area&quot;later this year.</TEXT></DOC>
