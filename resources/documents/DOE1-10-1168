The method is based on recording kinetic changes in paramagneticresonance spectra of coal organic substances during reactions with liquid(ethylene diamine) and gaseous (atmospheric oxygen) reagents. Tests werecarried out on Kuzbass coal samples of less than 0.2 mm particle size.6 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
