The withdrawal was mentioned by Bruce Albert, a Lord Einstein executive, in response to a question during court testimony yesterday.    The testimony was given in connection with a lawsuit filed by WPP Group PLC against Lord Einstein and its principals. Lord Einstein was created in March after a walkout by the top executives of WPP's Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein unit.    The new agency already has hired a number of former Lord Geller employees and has accepted several accounts formerly held by that agency. Currently, the two agencies are battling in court over whether to continue preliminary injunctions barring Lord Einstein from accepting any more Lord Geller clients or employees.    People sympathetic to WPP said yesterday that Lord Einstein was forced to drop out of competition for the Fuji account by ad agency Young andamp; Rubicam Inc., which owns 49% of the start-up agency, because of a potential conflict with Young andamp; Rubicam client Eastman Kodak Co.    However, reached at home last night, Richard Lord, Lord Einstein's chairman, said the decision was made because Fuji needed a commitment to the competition by May 2, and Lord Einstein had just won the $30 million Saab-Scania account. He added that he never talked to Young andamp; Rubicam about Fuji. A board made up of Lord Einstein and Young andamp; Rubicam executives &quot;that was supposed to be constituted to decide conflict problems hasn't even been constituted yet,&quot; he said.    &quot;I want to show the world that we can live without Lord Geller business,&quot; Mr. Lord added. &quot;We don't have to build our agency by taking Lord Geller accounts.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
