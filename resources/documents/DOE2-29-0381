Microautoradiography revealedthat HM-PAO crossed the blood-brain barrier. Thin layer chromatographicstudies demonstrated the rapid disappearance of free HM-PAO in the braintissue. Back diffusion from brain to blood was found negligible. Fromthese observations, the familiar microsphere model was employed in themeasurements of blood flow with HM-PAO. This, however, resulted in muchlower flow values than simultaneously obtained values with the labeledmicrospheres. This underestimation was ascribed to the high affinityof HM-PAO to blood cells and serum protein. Taking the binding of HM-PAOto blood components into consideration, the following model equationwas designed for quantifying cerebral blood flow: Ce(t) = Ca(t) - kCa(t)* exp ( - kt), Cb(T) = F{integral} /sub 0//sup T/Ce(t)dt, where Ce andCa are the free HM-PAO concentration in the intravascular space and thearterial whole-blood concentration of HM-PAO, respectively, as a functionof time (t), Cb is the brain activity concentration, K is the rate constantfor the binding of HM-PAO to the blood components, F is the blood flowvalue, T is time of measurement, and * denotes the operation of convolution.In clinical studies, Cd(t) and Cb(T) are obtainable from a dynamic singlephoton emission computerized tomographic study of the brain and multiplearterial blood sampling, respectively. The values for F and k can beestimated using a non-linear least squares fitting method.</TEXT></DOC>
