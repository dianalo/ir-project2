Now he is in Italy, waiting to get to theUnited States.   Resnikov is a new arrival in this seaside, working-class townwhere about 5,000 other Soviet Jews wait to get U.S. visas. He isoptimistic.   ``It is my great luck that I have things that other people don'thave,'' he said.   He has American newspaper clippings that identify him as arefusenik and critic of the Kremlin _ proof, he hopes, that hemerits refugee status and a visa.   Still, Resnikov and the others know that there are too many ofthem and too few visas.   ``I struggled for nine years to get out. I struggled, fought andorganized many demonstrations,'' said Resnikov, an electro-chemistfrom Moscow.   ``We organized so many news conferences. My American friends toldus we were so brave. Now I have to prove my past.''   Once permission to go to the United States was almost automaticfor Soviet Jews. But Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who came to power in1985, opened the tap on what had been just a trickle of Jewishemigration from the Soviet Union.   Relief officials say the number of Soviet Jews passing throughItaly, the main processing point for Soviet refugees to America,rose from 600 in 1986 to 17,000 last year. Officials say 38,000 to50,000 will come this year.   The United States has agreed to accept 24,500 refugees from allof Eastern Europe, including the Soviet Union. However, others willbe accepted if they find sponsors in the United States.   ``The main idea is waiting and waiting, hoping something willchange, that the American government will change its mind,'' saidSam Nimeroski, 60, who arrived in late November and has beenrejected twice for an American visa.   Many of the 5,000 Soviet Jews currently in Ladispoli and about2,000 in other towns near Rome will get U.S. visas.   Meanwhile, most live only on the money they get from the AmericanJewish Joint Distribution Committee, a private Jewish relieforganization. But it is running out of money.   Nimeroski said he, his wife Ludmilla and their 3-year-old sonStanislav receive the equivalent in Italian lire of about $593 amonth. Of that, they pay $407 rent for a three-room apartment sharedwith two other families, 10 people in all.   Compared to other refugees the Soviet Jews in Ladispoli livepretty well, say officials of the Joint Distribution Committee. Theylive in apartments, rather than camps or cheap hotels. They have acommunity center and their own schools where classes are taught inRussian. An old movie house near the center of town has beenconverted into a synagogue.   Some food stores post signs in Russian, and a few merchants havelearned some Russian phrases.   But Deputy Mayor Enzo Paliotta says the refugees have overtaxedpublic services in this town of 16,500, about 25 miles from Rome.   Silvia Hassenfeld, president of the joint committee, said theorganization has temporarily stopped sending refugees here becauseof that.   While they wait, scores of Soviets gather each day near thefountain in the central Piazza Vittoria.   ``Among our people there is only one topic, leaving forAmerica,'' said Mrs. Nimeroski. ``It is very difficult to talk aboutthis all day because it is a very unpleasant topic.''   Relief officials say they have no other appeal if they are turneddown for a visa, and their only recourse is finding a sponsor inAmerica.   ``I have no relatives in the United States. Nobody will pay forme,'' said Nimeroski, who was an educational administrator inTashkent.   He said he was persecuted as a Jew in the Soviet Union butbelieves U.S. officials rejected him because he had been a CommunistParty member.   ``They told me, `You were never in Siberia. Nobody beat you. Youare not a refusenik, you are just a man.'   ``I couldn't live in the country as a Jew,'' said Nimeroski. ``Iescaped from this country. What is my blame?''   All the Jewish refugees could go easily to Israel under the Lawof Return, said Uri Benzion, the distribution committee's directorof educational and social life programs here.   But Benzion and others say many of the refugees know almostnothing about the Jewish faith and feel no special tie to Israel.   Italy has no limit on how long they can stay, but it accepts themon condition they will eventually move on. They are not allowed toget jobs while in teh country, however.   Some Soviet Jews who have failed to get U.S. visas apply to go toother countries. Some select Australia or Canada while others mightseek entry into another West European country.   Because the distribution committee is running out of money, it isconsidering options other than the arrangement in Ladispoli, such asrefugee camps, and is asking the refugees to seek financial helpfrom friends and relatives.   ``We are also suggesting to them that Israel is a very viableoption,'' said Ms. Hassenfeld.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs Feb. 27</NOTE></DOC>
