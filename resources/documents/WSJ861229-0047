Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev is making clear through a number of channels that he still wants to negotiate with the Reagan administration. His trade minister, Boris Aristov, passed this message to former President Richard Nixon, and Mr. Gorbachev himself relayed those intentions to Sen. Gary Hart (D., Colo.) during the senator's recent visit to Moscow.    Before the U.S. can negotiate successfully with Moscow, Frank Carlucci, who takes over as Mr. Reagan's national security adviser this week, must put the administration's arms-control house in order. The focus of his work thus far has been mopping up the Iran mess and replacing unwanted National Security Council staffers with his own people. To forge a coherent policy, he'll have to address the more difficult task of resolving differences between Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger over arms control.    &quot;One of our dearest hopes is that Frank can use his ties to Weinberger to get arms control on track,&quot; one administration official says. Mr. Carlucci served under Mr. Weinberger as deputy secretary of defense in the first Reagan term. The State Department sees a golden opportunity for a historic agreement with a more flexible Kremlin leadership, but the Defense Department doesn't want to sacrifice its space defense plans for arms-control treaties that it doesn't trust the Soviets to respect.    Moving ahead on arms control is important. It's the most promising area for a foreign-policy success before Mr. Reagan leaves office. Moreover, a lack of progress could increase European pressure for unilateral disarmament, particularly in Britain; create a policy vacuum that could shake the unity of the Western alliance, and weaken the political base of Europe's conservative leaders.    The Soviets appear willing to approach arms control in steps. They have suggested the possibility of reaching agreements on medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe or on nuclear testing that are separate from a more-sweeping strategic arms pact that would have to include restraints on President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.    &quot;They want to cut a deal with Reagan,&quot; says Dmitri Simes of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He says the Soviets take the long view that they would like to bring America's conservatives into an arms-control agreement with them so that Mr. Reagan and his allies don't impede possible agreements in future administrations. &quot;They want to prove that these people can't escape an arms-control agreement,&quot; Mr. Simes says.    A Kremlin official told Mr. Nixon that &quot;there is more flexibility to the Soviet position than meets the eye,&quot; according to someone the former president briefed about his meeting.    Sen. Richard Lugar (R., Ind.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, says, &quot;It does appear the Soviets have indicated that they hope we won't be preoccupied with Iran. There are bigger fish to fry . . . . .They just don't want things to be dropped at this point.&quot;    Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who will become the majority leader when the Democrats take control of the Senate next month, clearly plans to pressure the administration to act on arms control.    Many Democrats think the administration has dropped the ball on arms control and hope to show that they can succeed where the Republicans failed. &quot;Byrd sees a rallying point there,&quot; says Sen. Lugar.    At Sen. Byrd's urging, Sen. Claiborne Pell (D., R.I.), who will become chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in January, plans early hearings to mark up two unratified arms-control treaties for Senate approval. Some Democrats are pressing for even tougher action, such as blocking funds for the strategic nuclear weapons that have pushed the U.S. over the limits in the unratified SALT II treaty.    Time is running out for the administration. Aside from the immediate need to head off congressional action, one senior official says, the administration also must start negotiating seriously with the Soviets within six months to avoid allowing the issue to get entangled in the 1988 presidential campaign.    Mr. Carlucci's task is to figure a way for the administration to capitalize on Moscow's apparent willingness to move forward. He must, however, also construct the process so that a too-eager president doesn't fall into Soviet traps like those Mr. Gorbachev set at the Reykjavik summit. </TEXT></DOC>
