Quayle, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force Two just beforelanding in Caracas, said the idea being considered by some Latinleaders to develop a united front to deal with their common debtcrisis is ``counterproductive.''   ``We are absolutely opposed to the idea of a debtors' cartel,''Quayle said. ``Our strong position is that a debtors' cartel is anon-starter'' because each country has different circumstances thatshould be addressed on an individual basis.   Quayle made the comments as he flew here to attend theinauguration Thursday of Venezuela's new president, Carlos AndresPerez.   Upon his arrival, Quayle caused a horn-honking stir at a busyintersection when he stopped his motorcade for an impromptu shoppingtrip at a small corner fruit market.   Quayle ate a banana and sampled a guava and handed out pinsbearing the U.S. and Venezuelan flags.   With some two dozen heads of state expected at the inauguration,the Third World debt drisis is expected to be a major topic ofdiscussion among the leaders and when they meet with Quayle inbilateral talks.   Today, Quayle's packed schedule included meetings with Perez andwith the country's outgoing president, Jaime Lusinchi, and ColombianPresident Virgilio Barco.   Quayle indicated that he would be discouraging efforts by some ofthe leaders, including Perez, to coordinate their tactics anddemands for dealing with creditors.   The vice president said he phoned former President Richard Nixonfor advice the night before his departure.   Nixon, as vice president in 1958, made a trip to Venezuela wherehe faced violent anti-American crowds. Quayle said they chattedabout that.   Quayle will stop in El Salvador on his way home Friday. Duringmeetings with political, military and labor leaders there he willstress the need to curtail human rights violations in the CentralAmerican country, officials said.   He will meet with outgoing president Jose Napoleon Duarte of theChristian Democratic Party and with representatives of right-wingfactions, but not with anyone from the leftist party battling forpower in the March 19 election, U.S. officials said.   One official said it would be awkward for Quayle to meet withleftist presidential candidate Guillermo Ungo since he is a civilianally of rebels fighting to overthrow the U.S.-backed government.   The vice president will meet with representatives of the rightistNationalist Republican Alliance, or ARENA, whose candidate AlfredoCristiani has led Christian Democrat Fidel Chavez Mena in opinionpolls, with Ungo trailing.   No official list of Quayle's meetings has been released.   But a State Department official involved in planning the tripsaid he is scheduled to meet with the presidents of Spain, Portugal,Brazil, Colombia and Honduras. He will also meet with a group ofCaribbean leaders.   One of the topics for those meetings will be the status of theU.S.-backed Contra rebels battling the leftist government ofNicaragua.   In El Salvador, an administration official said, Quayle intendsto have ``very straightforward'' conversations emphasizing that theadministration is serious about adherence to human rights.   Officials have expressed concern that continued human rightsproblems will make it difficult for the administration to obtainfurther U.S. aid for El Salvador from Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
