(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Whenever you read a glowing report on the inevitability of the paperlessoffice, that's a perfect time to call your broker and buy another 100 sharesof Crane, Hammermill, International Paper, Nekoosa, Xerox, or any companythat makes paper, photocopies, printers, staplers, or yellow highlighters.andO;Paper will be with us for a long, long time.andP;  The 100-plus new products in PCMagazine's annual review of printers are one more piece of evidence.andM;Each of these printers is dedicated to producing more, faster, cheaper, andbetter-quality output than its predecessors.andP;  How much output?andP;  A lot.andP;  An8-page-per-minute laser printer left running 8 hours a day would produce 14acres of output over the course of a year (somewhat less if it is printingunder Microsoft Windows).andP;  Multiply that by the 2 million laser printers soldthis year plus another 6 million dot matrix and ink jet printers and you'vegot a respectable-size pile of paper.andM;But seriously.andM;There is little in the way of revolutionary new printer technology this year,and there is plenty of evolutionary improvement.andP;  Here are some of the keytrends worth noting:andM;Cheaper printers.andP;  Two years ago, the idea of a $1,000 (street price) laserprinter was astounding; within a year, the $500 laser printer may be upon us.andO;Scalable-font laser printers are available for $1,000 to $1,500.andP;  You canfind a handful of 24-pin dot matrix printers for less than $200 and 9-pinprinters for less than $150.andM;Decline of the dot matrix printer.andP;  The dot matrix printer market peaked in1989 and 1990 and will decline by half over the next five years.andP;  The hardesthit will be 9-pin dot matrix printers.andM;Scalable fonts are in, but whose?andP;  Adobe PostScript, HP Intellifont, andMicrosoft TrueType each have pros and cons.andP;  The majority of laser printershave scalable fonts built-in, or you can add them for a relativelyinexpensive price.andP;  Epson America breathed some life into the dot matrixmarket with a series of three scalable-font printers.andM;Hot speciality printers.andP;  Networth printers have arrived led byHewlett-Packard Co. (no surprise here).andP;  High-quality color printers aremoving down into the $5,000 to $10,000 range; the personal color printermarket will heat up with HP's new $1,095 DeskJet 500C.andP;  Laptop users haveeven more intriguing choices, including a near-HP-LaserJet-quality printerhardly larger than a portable cellular phone.andP;  (Yes, it's slow.andP;  You can'thave everything.)andM;Here is a bit more detail on the state of the printer market today and whereit is headed next year.andM;LASER PRINTERSandM;Last year, HP was the biggest seller in the laser printer market.andP;  This year,HP is the biggest seller in the laser printer market.andP;  Next year, HP ...andP;  youget the picture.andP;  By some estimates, HP will sell more than a million laserprinters this year.andP;  HP provides tough competition, since it's hard to beatany HP product on quality, durability, or reputation, and in the case oflaser printers, it is also tough to beat HP on price.andP;  Last year was the yearfor a new mainstream HP 8-ppm laser printer, the scalable-font HP LaserJetIII.andP;  This printer features Resolution Enhancement Technology (RET), whichsmooths jagged edges on fonts and graphics as if the printer operated at 400dpi or so.andP;  This year, it was the 4-ppm upgrade of HP's LaserJet IIP (as inPersonal), LaserJet IIIP, and networkable 17-ppm LaserJet IIISi--each withscalable fonts and RET, and each of them an Editors' Choice in its category.andO;And as we went to press, HP was readying a replacement for the LaserJet IIP.andO;At a list price of $1,249, the LaserJet IIP Plus will add a faster processorand subtract $50 from the list price of the discontinued LaserJet IIP.andM;Sound invincible?andP;  Almost, but not quite.andP;  HP has a few chinks in its armor.andO;For starters, while all current HP printers can be adapted to run AdobePostScript, all except the LaserJet IIISi do a lousy job of switching backand forth.andP;  You have to turn off the printer, insert the $695 PostScriptcartridge, turn the power back on, and wait 2 minutes while the printerperforms a laborious self-test.andP;  Most competitors' printers can switch with asoftware command, and a few--QMS, for instance--do it automatically on acase-by-case basis.andP;  And you will want to switch: While PostScript is morerobust, HP PCL is miles faster at what it can do.andM;Two other vendors--Dataproducts Corp. in the desktop laser printer categoryand Tektronix in the color PostScript printer category--have Adobe PostScriptLevel 2, which promises more functionality and more speed.andP;  An increasingnumber have RISC processors from AMD, Intel, or Weitek to speed theformatting of complex pages.andM;Who is the competition for HP?andP;  According to Infocorp (a Santa Clara,California, market research firm), it is IBM Corp./Lexmark, Apple ComputerCorp., Panasonic Communications andamp; Systems Co., Canon USA, Texas Instruments,QMS, NEC Technologies, Kyocera, and Epson America, roughly in that order.andO;Apple printers are capable of working with PCs as long as you don't plan touse a parallel printer connection.andP;  IBM has solid units, but none are fasterthan 10 ppm.andP;  Panasonic printers are nothing special to look at, but theyoften provide 50 percent more engine speed than the competition at a givenprice.andP;  We reviewed 35 desktop laser printers in this issue, including the$1,595 scalable-font HP LaserJet IIIP; the $1,999 Okidata OL830 PostScriptprinter; and the $,1895 IBM LaserPrinter 6 and $2,395 LaserPrinter 10, withPostScript options that produce 600 dpi.andM;SHARED PRINTERSandM;By next year, a third of all laser printers will be connected to a network,Infocorp estimates, and the network printer category will show sales growththree times as great as the printer market as a whole.andP;  With that in mind,this year we have created a separate review category for shared printers.andM;In the past, network printers have often been run-of-the-mill laserprinters--most typically 8-ppm HP LaserJet printers or compatibles--that wereattached to network nodes.andP;  True network printers have a network adapter cardbuilt-in and can be directly connected to the network's coaxial ortwisted-pair cabling.andP;  This allows for faster data transfer than a parallelprinter cable (and is far, far faster than using a serial cable).andP;  A networkconnection also offers the potential (potential more than reality for now)for the printer to pass back to your PC messages more sophisticated than thecurrent &quot;Error&quot; or &quot;Check Printer&quot; error messages.andP;  Typically, they have RISCprocessors for imaging pages in a hurry, fast engines (at least 10 ppm,typically 15-plus ppm) to spit out the pages once they are imaged, andseveral big paper bins.andP;  Some shared printers offset each print job by aninch so users don't mistakenly take the first several pages of someone else'sprintout.andP;  Some can print on both sides of the page; some print on 11- by17-inch pages.andM;In this issue, we review ten such printers, from Eastman Kodak Co., HP, IBM,Kyocera, LaserMaster Technologies Corp., NCR Corp., Printware, QMS, SharpElectronics Corp., and Texas Instruments.andP;  Each costs between $5,000 and$20,000.andM;The shared printer market doesn't stop there, though.andP;  Xerox, for instance,sells a $220,000 laser printer, called the DocuTech, that is somewhat morefeature-rich--to put it mildly--than the shared printers reviewed here.andO;(Kodak has a similar 92-ppm system called the LionHeart.)andP;  The DocuTech canbest be described as a printer (plus photocopier, scanner, keyboard, mouse,video display, and gobs of memory) where you feed a tree into one end and getcollated, bound, and stapled documents out the other end--at 600-dpiresolution, 135 ppm, and up to 11- by 17-inch paper.andP;  No one who's seenDocuTech in action hasn't walked away impressed.andP;  But more than a few peoplewho have seen it wish for something with DocuTech's features scaled back froma 500,000-page-per-month (minimum) enterprise solution to a device in linewith the needs of a single department--perhaps 50 ppm (plus collating andstapling) for $50,000.andP;  If IBM, Kodak, or Xerox doesn't built one first,Japan Inc. will oblige.andM;Sharing a printer among several PCs is much easier these days, and not justfor the network-oriented shared printers.andP;  Several laser printers allow youto connect them to PCs by both the parallel and serial interfaces; theprinter buffers one print job while it prints the other.andP;  A half-dozenvendors produce remote LAN connections: modem-size boxes that let you attacha printer directly to the network cabling without dedicating an old PC to thetask.andP;  Products include the Castelle LANpress, HP 33480 LAN Connection, IntelNetPort Print Server, and Microtest LANport II.andP;  PC Magazine reviewed five ofthese devices--also called special function servers, or Ethernet (orToken-Ring) peripheral-sharing devices--in the January 15, 1991, issue;another review is scheduled for early next year.andP;  And you can also usetried-and-true- printer-sharing boxes (smart switchers) from companies suchas Black Box Corp., Buffalo Products, Digital Products, Fifth GenerationSystems, and Rose Instruments, among others.andM;DOT MATRIXandM;Innovation is hard to come by in dot matrix printers these days.andP;  Much of theresearch and development efforts centers around squeezing a few moreconstruction-cost dollars out of each unit.andP;  While the very cheapest unitsfeel tinny, they work fine for routine single-user office printing, and whocan argue against 9-pin printers that cost less than $150 or 24-pin unitsunder $200?andP;  Low-cost printers haven't become commodity items, but there is acertain similarity to many of the units.andP;  And while low prices may be musicto the ears of printer buyers, to the makers of dot matrix printers, themusic signifies musical chairs.andP;  Two years from now, there may be fewerchairs to sit in.andP;  Don't be surprised to see one or more vendors pull out ofthe business.andM;Fortunes ebb and flow from year to year, but Epson, Okidata, and Panasonicappear to have some of the best product mixes for now.andP;  Epson and Okidatahave done a good job selling low-end 9-pin printers not only to PC users butto service environments where the PC may be disguised as a cash register orairbill printer.andP;  Panasonic has done well in the 24-pin market.andP;  Panasonic'sKX-P2624 represents a step forward in quiet dot matrix printing.andP;  This is ahigher-end ($500 street price) 24-pin wide-carriage printer that produces 10to 20 percent less noise than other dot matrix printers.andP;  The company alsohas a dirt-cheap 24-pin unit, the KX-P1123, with a price hovering around$200.andP;  With prices like that, it's clear why 9-pin printers are in trouble.andM;Dot matrix market leader Epson has retired its LQ-800/1000-series 24-pinprinters after half a decade of service.andP;  The replacement LQ-870 and LQ-1170,plus the personal LQ-570, include a scalablefont technology called ESC/P2that works like PCL 5 or PostScript, albeit on a far more modest scale; youcan scale fonts only from 8 to 32 points.andP;  Epson says each printer &quot;comeswith a free diskette containing drivers for Microsoft Word, Windows,WordPerfect, WordStar, and more,&quot; but PC Labs found the Windows part to be abit misleading.andP;  The printer works under Windows, but the scalable fontsdon't.andP;  If you want scalable fonts, you have to buy a software product suchas Adobe Type Manager, which does font scaling (to 127 points) with any dotmatrix printer.andM;In a market that is not expanding, there have to be losers along withwinners.andP;  Alps America, Citizen America Corp., IBM/Lexmark, and SeikoshaAmerica have seen retrenchment in at least some segments of their dot matrixprinter businesses.andP;  Alsp, for instance, didn't have any new printers forreview this year.andM;The dot matrix market isn't all gloom and doom.andP;  Dot matrix printers willalways produce output for less than laser printers, roughly a penny a pageversus 2 to 4 cents a page.andP;  And wide-carriage printers loaded with 14 7/8-by11-inch paper can swallow massive spreadsheets better than laser printerscan.andM;FORMS AND LINE PRINTERSandM;Businesses printing thousands of invoices a week need fast, durable printersthat can print multipart forms.andP;  If the output is crisp and the printer isquiet, so much the better.andP;  Line printers are grouped in with the other dotmatrix printers, but they are a breed apart, costing at least $2,000 andrunning at 200 to 500 characters per second.andP;  There are actually two groupshere: fast, very-heavy-duty dot matrix printers from Genicom Corp. and IBM,and even faster, pricier speciality units from CIE America, Mannesmann TallyCorp., and Printronix.andP;  (The latter category includes printers, that acceptthe same commands as line priters, as well as more-common printer codes, eventhough they are not technically line printers because they don't print theentire line at once.)andM;COLOR POSTSCRIPT PRINTERSandM;A dollar a page isn't too much to spend if you need half a dozen coloroverhead transparencies in the next half-hour, or if you need a color proofof you upcoming ad campaign.andP;  The nine color PostScript printers reviewedhere give you fairly fast access to relatively faithful color prints andtransparencies.andP;  If the color is not as good as an 8-by 10-inch glossy colorprint or a printer's Chromalin proof separation, it is still pretty darngood.andM;Tektronix this year has released a phase-change solid-ink printer, the PhaserIII PXi, rthat is especially well suited for printing on all kinds of paper.andO;Most other high-end color printers are thermal wax transfer devices that workbest with coated stock or clear acetate.andP;  The Phaser III PXi's technology, incrudest terms, involves melting colored wax sticks (they feel like crayonsand you can draw with them if you're so inclined), spraying the color on thesheet, and then flattening the wax onto the paper by using a heavy roller.andO;While this process sounds simple, making it work well has been no easy feat.andM;For those users who want simpler and cheaper color output, there are colorribbons for most dot matrix printers, color toner cartidges for laserprinters (brown or blue, one color per cartridge), and the venerable HPPaintJet.andP;  New this year are color ink jet printers from Mannesmann Tally(the MT92C, $2,995) and HP (the HP DeskJet 500C, $1,500).andP;  Neither wasavailable in time for review; however, looks at preproduction units suggestthey will split the difference in quality between low-end color devices andthe $5,000-plus thermal was transfer printers.andM;PORTABLE PRINTERSandM;If there's one area that is truly innovative this year, it is thebattery-powered portable printer.andP;  The Kodak Diconix pioneered the marketseveral years ago, although this printer is fading in the wake of bettertechnology.andP;  Canon's BubbleJet BJ-10e, an Editors' Choice winner last year,is the current leader in price, performance, and quality.andP;  Two new printersproduce sensational print quality.andP;  The $469 Citizen PN48 is not much biggerthan a portable cellular phone, yet it produces essentiallylaser-printer-quality output--at a leisurely 25 cps.andP;  As for speed, theMannesmann Tally MT735 produces 6-ppm output from a unit the size of a reamof paper.andM;If you are less constrained by space and don't need battery-powered printing,any of the smallish dot matrix printers do a passable job.andP;  And if you'rereally space-constrained, you can use your laptop computer's modem and any ofthe electronic mail services--ATandamp;T Mail, CompuServe, or MCI Mail--to send afax to your hotel.andM;EASE OF USE/BELLS AND WHISTLESandM;For many users, ease of use is as important as--no, more important than--anextra 10 cps of print speed.andP;  As in previous years, the industry is more talkthan action.andM;HP, for instance, includes scalable fonts with its current printers, butthese printers are unable to scale the type on a slightly oversize Windowsspreadsheet to fit onto a single page, or to create multiple PageMakerthumbnail pages on a single sheet--something all PostScript printers can do.andO;HP LaserJet printers are technically capable of doing it, but the currentWindows driver isn't.andP;  Maybe next year, HP says.andM;Panasonic, which trumpted its KX-P1124 printer's row-column offsetfront-panel buttons as the last word in ease of use, found that the word mostusers would use is unprintable and quietly junked it in favor of a moretraditional LCD arrangement on its successor, the KX-P1124i.andM;While it doesn't make life easier for users, IBM has a front-panel innovationthat makes life easier for printers sales-people, if not for users.andP;  MostIBM/Lexmark dot matrix printers have a button marked Demo, which does exactlywhat you would expect.andM;A small but increasing number of laser printer vendors are offering envelopefeeder attachments so you don't have to run off and find a Selectric when youneed to address an envelope.andP;  An even smaller number of word processors nowhave macros or routines that grab the address off the letter on-screen, thendraw an envelope through the manual feed slot; you don't have to figure outthe page offsets and margins for an envelope.andM;For those who want even fewer hassles, two companies have or will havespeciality printers that print only envelopes, labels, or both.andP;  CoStar Corp.andO;(203-661-9700) makes a $595 envelope printer (the Address Writer) and a pairof label printers (the $249.95 LabelWriter II and $399 LabelWriter II Plus)that print on 1 1/8- by 3.5-inch and 2.25- by 4-inch labels, respectively.andP;  Aversion of Avery Dennison's LabelPro software will be bundled with theprinters; the label printers will also be sold by Avery Dennison as thePersonal Label Printer.andP;  Tidemark (415-490-5583) plans to market an $1,195envelope printer, the Address Express.andP;  Tidemark contends that its higherprice is offset by faster, better-quality printing and a lower cost forconsumables.andP;  Demonstration labels and envelopes produced by CoStar printerswere legible but not letter-quality; print resolution is 138 dpi (for theLabelWriter printers) and 144 dpi (for the AddressWriter).andM;High-speed envelope printers already exist for companies that need to addressthousands of envelopes a week (see &quot;Name and Address for Less: EnvelopePrinters Cut Your Costs,&quot; PC Magazine, January 29, 1991).andP;  CoStar andTidemark products are for more-modest needs.andM;LOOKING AHEADandM;More progress and new technology will come over the next year.andP;  Some of itwas predicted for this year.andP;  Laser printers have been stuck at 300-dpiresolution since the original LaserJet arrived, back in 1984.andP;  A half-dozencompanies do have higher-resolution output, but they only account for a tinycorner of the market.andP;  IBM offers the most impressive high-resolutionsolution we've seen: For about $4,100, you can buy the IBM LaserPrinters 10loaded up with enough memory to turn the Adobe PostScript option into 600-dpimode for spectacular output.andM;The multifunction printer is another once and future product.andP;  Also called ahydra device or multifunction peripheral, this concept involves combining alaser printer, scanner, fax, modem, and photocopier into one box, or a boxplus a controller box.andP;  An intriguing idea for the home, home office, orsmall business, the multifunction printer also poses a multi-headed threat:When it breaks, you lose you laser printer, scanner, fax, modem, andphotocopier all at once.andP;  In the meantime, there have been partial solutions.andO;HP offers a pricey but high-quality fax attachment ($1,895) for its LaserJetprinters, which could double as a scanner, with an as-yet unannounced upgradeand software.andP;  Kodak includes a 6-ppm convenience copier in its 16-ppmEastman Kodak Ektaplus 7016 PS.andP;  (This is reviewed in the shared laserprinter section in this issue.)andM;ABOUT THIS ISSUEandM;For our eighth annual review of printers, we divided this issue into fivesections: desktop laser printers, shared laser printers, ink jet printers(black-and-white and color), color PostScript printers (the $5,000-plusdevices), and dot matrix printers.andP;  The high-end dot matrix(line-printer-style) printers are in the dot matrix section.andP;  Portableprinters are covered in several sections, depending on their enginetechnology.andM;Each section is arranged alphabetically by company name; if the company hasseveral printers, they're grouped together in a single review.andP;  To beincluded in our reviews, printers had to be available by early summer.andP;  Wereviewed only new printers, plus previously reviewed printers that weresubstantially enhanced.andP;  The introduction to each section lists printers thathave been announced but were not available to meet our deadlines.andM;With the 106 printers reviewed here, we've now tested a grand total of 819.andO;To help you compare previously reviewed printers that are still on themarket, an index details each one's name, engine technology, print speed, andcurrent price, and the issue and page of the previous review.andP;  It naturallyincludes the printers reviewed in this issue.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
