These analysts are forecasting that a variety of rates, frombanks' prime lending rate to home mortgage rates, will head higherin the months ahead with the only debate being over whether thecentral bank's anti-inflation campaign will wind up pushing thecountry into a recession.   Fed policy-makers were meeting today behind closed doors toreview monetary targets. The 12-member Federal Open MarketCommittee, composed of members of the Fed board and regional Fedbank presidents, meets eight times a year to set interest rate andmoney growth policies.   Today's session is an anniversary of sorts. It was at the Marchmeeting one year ago that the central bank decided to launch agradual effort to drive short-term interest rates higher in aneffort to keep the economy from overheating.   Since then, short-term rates have risen by more than 3percentage points, more than the increases that preceded six of thepast seven recessions, according to researchers at Merrill Lynch.   While such statistics have trigg fears of a new recession,the Fed is likely toshing rates higher because inflationarypressurfar shown no signs of abating, economists say.   Inflation ate wholesale level has been racing ahead at analarming annual rate of 12.6 percent in the first two months ofthis year and consumer prices have been climbing at a 6.1 percentannual rate, up sharply from the 4.4 percent e in consumerprices turned in during the past    The Fed moved aggressively in Februaryto tighten creditfurther, including hiking its discount rate, the in to make bank loans,to 7 percent. An increase in thediscount te is the most dramatic signal the central bank can sendof itsintentions to fight inflation with higher intereany private economistsare not looking for an immediate move attoday's meeting to tighter credit further, in p FederalReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and other Fed officials haveindicated in recent comments that they are prepared to take abreather to review the effects of their earlier actions.ecent weaknessin retail sales, factory orders and housingconstruction give some indication that the Fed's efforts areslowing growth. But with inflationary pressures still many economists believe the Fed will be forced to squeeze credittighter, even as evidence of a slowing economy mounts.   David Jones, an economist with Aubry G. Lanston andamp;ment securities dealer,predicted that interest rates willremarly stable from April through June but that the credit tightening inearly summer.   Those moves will push fid-rate mortgages, now at 11.22percent, up to 1l, Jones said, with otherrates, such as banks' prime lending rate rising as well.   Paul Getman, an economist with the WEFA Group, an economicconsulting firm, forecast an even more rapid rise in interestrates, saying he looked for the prime rate, rrently at 11.5percent, to climb to 12 percent by late April.   He said the Fed was also likely to boost itcount rate overthe next couple of months by one-half percentage point to 7.5percent.   President Bush hastedly said since taking office that theFed shoned about economic growth as well as inflationand 70 of 174 Re the House fired off a letter toGreenspan last week urging himest rates to avert arecession.   Among private economists, there is a split over whether the Fedcan achieve its goal of a``soft landing'' which would seeslow enough to cool down inflation but not topple the country intoa recession.   David Wyss, chief financ for Data Resources Inc., aLexorecasting firm, said he believes that the Fedwill be able to fight inflation d keep the six-year economicrelive.   ``We think the Fed's will work, but the risks of amistake are substantial,'' he said.   However,, saying, ``Throughout history, thesoft landing hasn't worked. It just isn't possible to fine-conomy.''   Jones said he was looking for a recession but notar, in part becausethe Fed willighten aggressively untilsummer because of political pressure e White House.   ``One of theush administration is to put offthis recession as long as posse. That is why they are subtly not to tighten,'' Jones said.</TEXT></DOC>
