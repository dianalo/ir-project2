According to the survey, 57 percent of home buyers in 1988 fitthe category of ``move-up'' buyers.   A National Association of Home Builders report says 66 percentof all home construction is geared to the ``move-up'' market.   These buyers are choosing ``neo-traditionalism'' in theirhousing, says Joan McCloskey, executive building editor of BetterHomes and Gardens magazine.   ``They want a traditional exterior, including a return to theporch, but a contemporary interior, with special attention aimed atthe entry,'' she says.   They also seek more space and bigger rooms, she says, which``can also mean more lighting within rooms and ceiling heightsrising to nine feet and higher.''   Among other elements: a kitchen with large pantries and openaccess to the family room and the outdoors; master suites withwalk-in closets, sitting areas and built-in electronics; a ``mediawall'' in the family room, and better location, closer to goodschools, work and public and health care facilities.</TEXT></DOC>
