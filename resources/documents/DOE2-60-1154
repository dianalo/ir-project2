Using this potential, the binding energy of a group of doubleclosed shell nuclei is calculated according to the shell model. Also,the binding energy of /sup 12/C and /sup 16/O is calculated assumingBrink's model and using the VG2 interaction together with the potentialdeduced by Arickx et al. Reasonable agreement with experimental datais obtained.</TEXT></DOC>
