Woolworth Co. reported fiscal first-quarter net income rose 45%, reflecting improved sales and profit margins and flat costs.    For the quarter ended May 2, net grew to $29 million, or 43 cents a share, from $20 million, or 30 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales increased 8.4% to $1.53 billion from $1.41 billion.    Operating profit before unallocated items advanced 22% to $72 million from $59 million a year earlier.    Specialty-store sales rose 14% and general merchandise sales rose 5.4%. Domestic sales rose 6.4% and foreign sales gained 12%. Foreign sales would have increased only 3.8%, the company said, had they been translated into U.S. dollars at year-earlier foreign exchange rates. </TEXT></DOC>
