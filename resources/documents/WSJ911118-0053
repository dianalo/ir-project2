Last week's gloomy news -- from the drop in retail salesto the jump in jobless-insurance claims to Friday'sstock-market plunge -- hardly inspires confidence that theeconomy is indeed recovering and will avoid a double-diprecession.</LP><TEXT>   Much will depend, of course, on what occurs in comingweeks in Washington. For now, no one knows if the economy'smodest third-quarter rise was merely an uptick in along-running slump or the start of a sustained recovery. Butthe evidence, on balance, still points to the lattereventuality.   Double-dip recessions are rare, but they do occur. Theeconomy rose briefly amid the year-long recession of 1969-70.And many analysts regard the six-month recession of 1980 andthe 16-month recession of 1981-82 as really a huge,double-dipping slump interrupted by a year of economicgrowth.                                                                                                          Even before last week's batch of bad news, much of thecommentary about the outlook assumed that the recession hadreturned or would soon do so.                                                                                                          On successive public-TV programs early this month, forexample, Robert MacNeil of the nightly news show spoke of&quot;this new downturn in the economy,&quot; Jack Nelson of the LosAngeles Times claimed &quot;most economists now say we're going todrop back into a recession&quot; and, in a Halloween mood, LouisRukeyser of Wall Street Week warned that things are &quot;prettyscary out there.&quot;   Since Friday, understandably, the pessimism has mounted. Apage-one story in yesterday's New York Times talksmatter-of-factly of an &quot;economy mired in recession.&quot;   Perhaps such pessimism will eventually prove justified.One should bear in mind, however, that recessionary gloomoften continues to enshroud discussions of the economy longafter a recession has ended.   Several weeks ago, Federal Reserve Board Chairman AlanGreenspan warned that the present recovery was having&quot;significant difficulty.&quot; This rekindled recessionary fears.But it's worth recalling that in August 1976, more than ayear after the recession of 1973-75, the same Mr. Greenspan,then serving as President Ford's chief economist, stirredrecessionary worries by warning that a &quot;pause&quot; had developedin the recovery -- which in fact went on to set a peacetimerecord for durability.                                                                                                          For all the uncomplimentary criticism their effortsperennially receive, forecasters are right about theeconomy's general direction more often than they are wrong.So it's encouraging that most economists, in fact, look forthe recovery to persist, though sluggishly.                                                                                                          For instance, this month's survey of 53 forecasters byBlue Chip Economic Indicators, a newsletter, finds that thegroup, on average, expects the economy to expanduninterruptedly through the rest of this year and next. Thegrowth rate, however, is expected to be far less than normalin a recovery -- only 1.9% annually this quarter and slightlyfaster in 1992. The survey was taken before the market'splunge. But Robert J. Eggert, who conducts it, says an&quot;informal&quot; post-plunge poll of several dozen analysts showslittle change in the consensus.   The economy grew at a 2.4% rate in the third quarter,after falling for three quarters. Other recent data point tofurther gains. Most interest rates and labor costs -- facetsof the economy that can restrict expansion when they rise toorapidly -- have been edging down. Productivity, aftersagging, has recently revived. Consumer-price inflationremains moderate.   To be sure, the Commerce Department's index of leadingeconomic indicators, after a long climb, recently slippedslightly. But that's not uncommon once a recession has ended.Moreover, an index that normally foreshadows the economy'sups and downs by longer lead-times than the Commerce indexrecently rose to a record.   This long-leading index, which extends back to 1948, iscompiled at Columbia University's Center for InternationalBusiness Research. Geoffrey H. Moore, the center's director,says the showing of the index and &quot;recent strength in othereconomic precursors&quot; suggest the recovery is continuing.&quot;Nothing has happened in the last week or so to change myview,&quot; he adds, &quot;and the stock market's day-to-day gyrationsfrankly aren't that significant.&quot;                                                                                                          Nonetheless, the possibility of a double-dip recessioncan't be dismissed. Many consumers and businesses remainstrapped, burdened by debt and bereft of savings. Themarket's plunge will surely erode confidence further. Whenstate and local taxes are taken into account, the tax load isat a record. So is the federal budget deficit, and the redink seems certain to keep rising. This, in turn, may welllimit any governmental moves to spur the economy throughcutting taxes and boosting spending.                                                                                                          For all the pain they produce, recessions tend to cleansethe economy of excesses that develop during expansions --torrid inflation, lofty interest rates, unsustainable debt.It's no coincidence that very long, very severe recessionsoften precede vigorous, enduring expansions. But the latestrecession -- if it indeed has ended -- can hardly be classedas very long or very severe. Most economists reckon it lastedless than a year, from July 1990 to May of this year, withunemployment holding below 7% of the labor force.   So the likelihood of a strong expansion in coming monthsappears remote. Nor can one rule out a resumption of therecession. But the likeliest prospect -- according to mostforecasters and much of the data they peruse -- is forcontinuing recovery, albeit lackluster, from a rather mildrecession.</TEXT></DOC>
