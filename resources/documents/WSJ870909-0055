The secretary told a National Press Club luncheon that the NEA isn't in concert with the views of the American public or the nation's teachers. Every presidential candidate, he said, should be asked: &quot;On which issues will you stand with the NEA, and on which will you stand with the American people?&quot;    &quot;For a candidate of the Democratic Party,&quot; he continued, &quot;defying the NEA on certain issues will be an act of political courage; but it will be far from an act of political suicide.&quot;    Mary Hatwood Futrell, NEA president, released a statement saying the secretary's real concern is self-promotion. Mr. Bennett is &quot;interested only in playing to the media and exploiting education to position himself for higher office -- the vice presidency or even higher,&quot; said Mrs. Futrell.    She said his real problem with the union is &quot;we have stood between him and his efforts to undermine the federal role in education.&quot; In each of Mr. Bennett's years in office, Mrs. Futrell said, the NEA has successfully fought Reagan administration attempts to slash federal education spending.    Terry Michael, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said that the Reagan administration has done &quot;a great disservice&quot; to American education and that Democrats wouldn't look to Mr. Bennett for advice on the subject.    Earlier this year, the secretary told White House budget officials that it was poor strategy continually to propose education budgets that are significantly less than what Congress and the president eventually approve. Mr. Bennett's budget request for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 1988, is expected to be 50% higher than the $14 billion he sought for the fiscal year that begins next month.    Mr. Bennett, who quit the Democratic Party to join the Republican Party after becoming secretary 2 1/2 years ago, also criticized Republicans because, he said, they &quot;sometimes speak as if nothing is more important than to save money.&quot;    He called on the GOP &quot;to set forth a distinctive, tough-minded and positive education agenda. And one part of that agenda should consist of improving the education of the disadvantaged.&quot;    Secretary Bennett's remarks were delivered three days before a presidential candidates' forum on education in Chapel Hill, N.C. Democratic and Republican hopefuls, at different sessions, will present their views on the subject.    Mr. Bennett said the candidates shouldn't simply &quot;market mawkishness,&quot; in which they say education is important because children are important, without offering serious policies and programs.    &quot;When an issue is arguably the No. 1 domestic concern of the American people, candidates have an obligation to become knowledgeable about it and to propose concrete and credible policies based on cogent analysis,&quot; he added. </TEXT></DOC>
