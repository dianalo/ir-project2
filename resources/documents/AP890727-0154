That is a very real problem.''   Wendt met with reporters on what he called a routine trip toconsult some partners in the 17-member Coordinating Committee forMultilateral Export Controls _ CoCom _ based in Paris.   Saying CoCom's purpose was not to impose political sanctions butto reduce the military threat to the West, Wendt said CoCompartners had no plans to change the preferred status given China,despite last month's crackdown on its pro-democracy movement. Buthe said there would be no more concessions to Beijing.   ``No one wishes to roll back what has already beenaccomplished,'' he said. ``For further liberalization, this is notthe time. The policy is not abandoned, but it is in suspense.''   Although he declined to discuss specific CoCom violations, Wendtacknowledged that U.S. authorities were concerned with sensitiveexports leaving West Germany for the Soviet bloc.   A U.S. Defense Department document obtained by The AssociatedPress earlier this year identified West Germany as a major sourceof technology leakage.   Wendt said officials in Bonn assured him they were tighteninglicense procedures, penalties and enforcement, and that the WestGermans were aware of possible leaks because of joint ventures withMoscow.   ``We believe their response has been very encouraging,'' saidWendt.   Although draft legislation to tighten exports is pending, WestGerman officials were limited to firmer application of existingrules until the new laws were passed, Wendt said.   Also, he said, exports were vital to the West German economy,creating political pressures.   West Germany, among other CoCom partners, has argued forcefullythat excessive U.S. caution stifles trade and ties down enforcingagents.   Wendt said that Washington tends to be a ``a bit more riskaverse,'' than its CoCom partners, but that no fundamentaldifferences divided the organization.   Last week, CoCom partners agreed to remove export controls onsome desktop computers, such as the AT, a widely used IBM model.Some other controls were relaxed. Wendt said the decisions wouldtake effect Aug. 15.   Earlier, Washington abandoned the ``no exceptions'' policyimposed on the Soviet Union after the Red Army moved intoAfghanistan in 1979 to prop up the pro-Moscow regime. The sanctionbanned all sensitive exports with no possibility of case-by-casereview. The last Soviet troops left Afghanistan in February.   Wendt said the Bush administration wanted to respond positivelyto Soviet reforms, and ``to integrate the Soviet Union into theinternational system and encourage it to use its power andpotential to solve international problems rather than exploitthem.''   At the same time, he said, ``We must not forget that even ifpolitical and economic relations improve, there is a continuingneed to deny them the goods and technologies to enhance theirmilitary capacity.''   CoCom members are Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark,France, Greece, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway,Portugal, Spain, Turkey, West Germany and the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
