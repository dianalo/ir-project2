They are faced with the hard choice of electing leaders tonegotiate with an Israeli government that has ruled out statehood,or using force and diplomacy to try to dislodge Israel from theWest Bank and Gaza.   President Bush's endorsement of Shamir's proposal for electionsin the territories was coupled during the visits with a reiterationof U.S. opposition to establishment of an independent Palestinianstate.   These moves cheered the Shamir government, which had been urgedby the administration to come up with ``new ideas'' for dealingwith the 1.4 million Palestinians who have been under Israelicontrol since 1967.   While the details are not clear, the goal set by the primeminister is a trial period of local self-rule, with negotiations ona permanent settlement to be conducted afterward by Israel,Palestinians, Egypt and Jordan.   However, Bush also said Israel should end its occupation of theterritories and had no sovereignty claim to the land lost by theArabs in the 1967 Six-Day war. Bush's endorsement of Shamir'selection proposal tended to overshadow the strong statement, but itregistered on the Israeli government because it is an unqualifieddemand.   Previous administrations left open the possibility that Israelmight retain some of the land as a security zone while tradingterritory for peace.   Shamir reiterated his position that retention of the West Bankis essential for Israel's security. His concern is not that a smallPalestinian state would overwhelm Israel militarily. Rather, aclose aide said, the Palestine Liberation Organization's statedstrategy is to gain a foothold on the West Bank and to trigger awar between Israel and the Arab countries.   The Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidthe Arabs enjoy a 10-1 advantage in weapons, while Shamir stressedin a speech Thursday that the most densely populated center ofIsrael, without the West Bank, is as wide as the distance betweenthe White House and suburban Chevy Chase.   ``The choice is not between Israel keeping the territories orrisking war,'' he said. ``The opposite is true. If we leave, therewill almost certainly be war.''   At the end of Shamir's visit the Israeli delegation seemedsatisfied with the results. Privately, the official said, they hadtold their American hosts at the start that the Bush administrationwas drifting toward support of PLO positions and that Israel wasprepared to make a public issue of its concern.   ``The critical thing to change is the signal the U.S. is sendingthe Arabs,'' the official said. ``Both sides decided to find amiddle ground, and we found it.''   Still, the Bush administration will keep talking to the PLO, tothe dismay of Israel, which accuses the group of unrelentingterrorism. And Bush's statements on the West Bank and Gaza appearto leave no room for compromise.   Mubarak's visit, meanwhile, produced U.S. assurances that Bushand Secretary of State James A. Baker III consider the situation inthe territories untenable. The Egyptian leader worked hard attrying to convince them that an international peace conferencewould instantly produce direct negotiations between Israel and theArabs.   Bush gave the idea lukewarm endorsement, saying a conferencemight help at the appropriate time and under the rightcircumstances. More important, from Mubarak's viewpoint, thepresident and Baker left no doubt the administration would notpermit the situation in the territories to stagnate.   Bush underscored a need for ``creativity'' and ``imaginativeways'' of rethinking the peace process.   His exploration of the possibilities will resume April 19 with avisit to Washington by King Hussein of Jordan. Over the long run,though, the Palestinians' response to Shamir's proposal could holdthe key.   Shamir said a majority of the Palestinians on the West Bank andin Gaza want a peaceful settlement in preference to their 15{-monthbloody uprising. He also predicted they are likely to participatein the election.   Their initial response was a cool one, while PLO chairman YasserArafat, on a visit to Congo, criticized the proposal asinappropriate and said the uprising would continue ``until theultimate victory.''   Hanna Sindora, editor of the pro-PLO daily Al Fajr newspaper,said, ``I think the intefadeh will continue until Shamir comes upwith a better proposal.''   But Bush, declaring that ``the climate is better than it's beenfor a while,'' said the election plan represents a welcome steptoward progress.   ``In the Middle East, a little step sometimes can ... prove tobe fruitful,'' he said Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
