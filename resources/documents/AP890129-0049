Much of thedreary weather was ahead of an upper level area of low pressure thatextended from the southern Rockies into the central Plains.   A large area of high pressure over the Great Basin of Nevada andwestern Utah generated the easterly wind known as the Santa Ana oversouthern California. Wind speeds of 25 to 35 mph were reportedacross the region during the morning. A wind advisory was postedthrough Monday for the southern California mountains, the lowerColorado River Valley and in the intermediate valleys near canyonsacross southern California.   The steep change in pressure between that high and a low overnorthern Manitoba channeled gusty westerly wind over the northernRockies in Montana.

A high wind warning was posted through Monday forthe eastern slopes of the Montana Rockies and the lower YellowstoneValley.
