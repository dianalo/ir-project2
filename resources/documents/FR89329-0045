This regulation, entitled ``Fuel Composition andUse_Volatile Motor Fuels,'' prohibits any person from selling or supplyingfrom a bulk plant or terminal, gasoline having a Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP)greater than 9.0 pounds per square inch (psi) from May 1 through September15 beginning in 1989 and continuing each year thereafter.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On November 12, 1987, the Commissioners of the Northeast States for CoordinatedAir Use Management (NESCAUM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding expressingtheir intention to reduce the RVP of gasoline to 10.0 psi starting in thesummer of 1988 and to 9.0 psi in the summer of 1989 and continuing everyozone season thereafter. Many states, including New York, experienced delaysin adopting necessary regulations and did not reduce RVP to 10.0 psi inthe summer of 1988. New York is, therefore, limiting RVP to 9.0 psi fromMay 1 to September 15 starting in 1989, and continuing each year thereafter.New York adopted its RVP regulation on December 5, 1988 and submitted itto EPA as a SIP revision on January 31, 1989.EPA published a notice of final rulemaking on March 22, 1989 (54 FR 11868)which also requires the control of RVP. The EPA rule calls for the controlof the volatility of gasoline nationally. The rule requires that in theNortheast, the standard will be 10.5 psi beginning in 1989. The Federalstandard will be enforced each year beginning June 1 (for retail usersand other end users of gasoline) or May 1 (for all other points in thedistribution system) except in 1989 when enforcement will begin 100 daysand 70 days (respectively) after the publication date of the final rule.Enforcement ends at all points in the system on September 16 of each year.The EPA regulation would normally preempt the state provision under section211(c)(4) of the Clean Air Act (the Act). However, section 211(c)(4)(C)of the Act provides for approval of state control of fuel or fuel additivesif the control is part of the SIP and is necessary to achieve the primaryor secondary national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for which theplan is in effect.<ITAG tagnum="84">Criteria for Approval</ITAG>Section 211(c)(4)(A) of the Act, in describing Federal preemption authority,states: ``Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (B) or (C), no State(or political subdivision thereof) may prescribe or attempt to enforce,for the purposes of motor vehicle emission control, any control or prohibitionrespecting use of a fuel or fuel additive in a motor vehicle or motor vehicleengine_(i) if the Administrator has found that no control or prohibitionunder paragraph (1) is necessary and has published his finding in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, or (ii) if the Administrator has prescribedunder paragraph (1) a control prohibition applicable to such fuel or fueladditive, unless [the] State prohibition or control is identical to theprohibition or control prescribed by the Administrator.''Thus in light of the new Federal volatility rule, the state control wouldnormally be preempted.However, even where preemption has occurred, EPA may still approve certainstate provisions for limits on RVP of fuel where a finding under section211(c)(4)(C) is made which would authorize EPA approval and, thus, eliminatethe preemption problem. As set forth below, section 211(c)(4)(C) authorizesEPA to approve into the SIP a state-adopted fuel control measure that hasotherwise been preempted by EPA action if EPA finds that the state control``is necessary to achieve'' the standard for which the SIP is in effect.Section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Act, in setting forth the circumstances underwhich an exception to Federal preemption of state regulation may occur,states: ``A State may prescribe and enforce, for purposes of motor vehicleemission control, a control or prohibition respecting the use of a fuelor fuel additive in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine if an applicableimplementation plan for such State under section 110 so provides. The Administratormay approve such provision in an implementation plan, or promulgate animplementation plan containing such a provision, only if he finds thatthe State control or prohibition is necessary to achieve the national primaryor secondary ambient air quality standard which the plan implements.''In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> discussion of EPA's approval of a state oxygenatedfuels program in the Maricopa County, Arizona SIP, EPA Interpreted thislanguage as requiring the Agency to find that a fuel control requirementwas essential to achieve timely attainment of the primary standard forcarbon monoxide. EPA said further that a fuel control measure may be ``necessary''for timely attainment if no other measures that would bring about timelyattainment exist, or if such other measures exist and are technically possibleto implement, but are unreasonable or impracticable. Otherwise, no fuelcontrol would ever be ``necessary,'' since for any area there is at leastone measure_namely, required shutdowns and prohibitions on driving_thatwould result in timely attainment of the NAAQS. It is doubtful that Congresswould have intended to bar EPA from approving State fuel controls intoa SIP based on the availability of such drastic alternatives.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T4>Federal Register</T4>, August 10, 1988, 53 FR 30220, 30228.<ITAG tagnum="85">Evaluation of How the New York Revision Satisfies the ``Necessary''Criterion</ITAG>New York City Metropolitan AreaIn its 1984 New York City metropolitan area (NYCMA) SIP, the State estimatedthat it would need to reduce volatile organic compound (VOC) emissionsby 59 percent over 1982 levels in order to meet the ozone standard by 1987.This translates to a 199,676 ton per year (tpy) reduction in VOC emissions.EPA has evaluated the State's progress in obtaining these reductions anddetermined that the State has only achieved a 38.1 percent reduction from1982 levels; a reduction of 70,938 tpy identified in the SIP as necessaryto attain the standard has yet to be achieved. The reasons for this shortfallare varied and include lack of (or inadequate) implementation of certainmeasures, less than anticipated effectiveness of certain measures, growthin vehicle miles traveled and the unanticipated growth in emissions dueto increases in gasoline RVP in recent years.As an example of the effect of one of these reasons for the shortfall,in its 1984 SIP for the NYCMA, the State committed to study the feasibilityof reducing VOC emissions from architectural coatings, consumer/commercialsolvent use and automobile refinishing. These three control measures wereidentified as extraordinary control measures that were beyond reasonablyavailable control technology (RACT) and, as such, were not reasonably available.In addition to the State's commitment to study these three source categories,the State originally estimated that these controls would reduce VOC emissionsby 29,800 tpy. The results of the State's current study suggest that theextraordinary controls would not be 100 percent effective because theseare area sources, and therefore would not yield the reductions originallyanticipated. The State estimates that the reductions attributable to thethree extraordinary measures would be as low as 4,300 tpy.To make up for the emission reduction shortfall, the State developed andadopted a regulation that would reduce the volatility of gasoline soldin the State during the ozone season. The New York submittal and relateddocuments contain the State's analysis of the emission reductions thatthe extraordinary measures would achieve and the remaining shortfall. Thatanalysis concludes that the New York RVP regulation would reduce VOC emissionsby an estimated 9,000 tpy in the NYCMA. This estimate may understate theactual reductions because it does not include the emissions reductionsthat would result from decreased running losses associated with lower volatilitygasoline. Running losses are emissions from the gasoline tank and fuelsystem that occur while a car is being driven and which overload the evaporativecontrol system or escape through the filler cap. New York has estimatedthat the RVP regulation would reduce emissions by 19,000 tpy if runninglosses are taken into account.Using information available in the New York SIP and Reasonable FurtherProgress Report for 1986, along with supplemental information submittedby the State, EPA determined that New York has only achieved a 38.1 percentreduction from 1982 levels in the NYCMA. This translates to at least a33.8 percent reduction from the 1987 inventory. It is also important torecognize that the 59 percent emission reduction that guided New York'sselection of control measures has proven to be too low. EPA's experiencewith Regional Oxidant Model runs for the Northeast indicated that a VOCemission reduction on the order of at least 75 percent from 1982 levelsis needed for attainment of the ozone standard. Under this scenario, theemission reductions needed for attainment of the zone standard translateto at least a 59.7 percent reduction from the 1987 inventory, or 54,149tpy in addition to the 199,676 tpy that has been identified in the SIP.The VOC strategies that are not yet implemented which have the greatestpotential for significant future VOC reductions are:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,10,10</C> <H1>Measure</H1><H1>Reductions (tpy)</H1><H1>Percent of 1987 inventory</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Reduce RVP from 11.5 to 9.0<D>9,004</D><D>4.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Architectural Coating Consumer/Commercial Auto Refinishing (combined)<D>4,300 </D><D>2.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">RACT for Small Sources <D>3,978 </D><D>1.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Perc Dry Cleaners <D>3,947 </D><D>1.9</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Total <D>21,229 </D><D>10.2</D></ITAG></ITAG>The potential combined reductions from other categories suggested by EPAfor examination by other NESCAUM states, if found practicable, may providean additional 1.5 percent emission reduction. This would yield a totalreduction of 11.7 percent if all were 100 percent effective. There wouldstill be at least a 22.1 percent VOC emission reduction shortfall. In orderto make up for this remaining shortfall, the State is considering additionalchanges to its motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program along withother measures as part of the Post-1987 Ozone SIP planning process. A reasonablelevel of I/M program changes would result in less than a 5,000 tpy reductionin emissions. Thus, even in such reasonable I/M enhancements are implemented,a shortfall will still exist necessitating the implementation of othermeasures to achieve attainment.By reducing RVP to 9.0 psi instead of 10.5 psi, New York would be ableto obtain additional reductions of approximately 3,800 tpy. Therefore,even with EPA's RVP regulation reguiring control to 10.5 psi in 1989, theState regulation will still have a significant impact. It will provide,approximately, an additional 1.8 percent reduction per year beyond theEPA reduction.Thus, New York's RVP program appears to meet the appropriate test of being``necessary'' to achieve attainment of the ozone standard. The fact thatthe State RVP regulation might not by itself fill the remaining shortfalland hence by itself achieve the standard does not mean the rule would notbe ``necessary'' to achieve the standard within the meaning of section211(c)(4)(C). EPA believes that if Congress had intended EPA to approvea state fuel-content rule only if it were necessary and sufficient to achievethe standard, then it would have used that language in section 211(c)(4)(C).EPA believes that the ``necessary to achieve'' standard must be interpretedto apply to measures which are needed to reduce ambient levels (thus bringingthe area closer to achieving the NAAQS) when no other reasonable measuresare available to achieve this reduction. A contrary application of ``necessaryto achieve'' in this situation would mean that measures which result insignificantly improved air quality are nonetheless unacceptable (even thoughno other reasonable measures are available) merely because they are insufficientin themselves to provide the reductions necessary to achieve attainmentof the NAAQS.It must be noted that the State's submittal indicated that the regulationwas intended ``as a replacement volatile organic compound control measurefor a portion of three existing SIP commitment to control VOC through measuresthat have been categorized as extraordinary, and as a package that improvesthe ground level ozone situation on its own merits.'' EPA is not at thistime determining that this measure replaces the three extraordinary measureswhich are part of the 1984 SIP for the NYCMA. EPA will evaluate the State'ssubmittal of regulations implementing these measures which was receivedon December 5, 1988 and take action in a separate <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. EPA is proposing action today with theknowledge that New York's overwhelming intention in seeking EPA approvalof this SIP revision, is to continue to make progress toward attainingthe ambient air quality standard for ozone through the implementation ofRVP controls.Finally, EPA notes that its 211 (c)(4)(C) covers not only the designatedNYCMA nonattainment area, but also Orange and Putnam Counties. In its June6, 1988 proposal concerning nonattainment designations pursuant to theMitchell-Conte Amendment (53 FR 20722), EPA proposed to include Orangeand Putnam Counties within the NYCMA nonattainment area because of theircontribution to ozone formation in that area. For the same reason, EPAalso indicated in letters dated May 26, 1988 to New York State that bothcounties must be included in Post-1987 SIP planning for the NYCMA. Seealso, 52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987). Therefore, EPA today concludes thatimplementation of the RVP rule in Orange and Putnam Counties is necessaryto achieve the ozone standard in the NYCMA.Upstate Nonattainment AreasDuring the summers of 1987 and 1988, air monitoring data revealed numerousexceedances of the ozone NAAQS indicating actual nonattainment of the standardin Jefferson, Erie, Niagara, Dutchess, Essex, Albany, Schenectedy, Rensselaer,Saratoga, and Washington Counties. New York has submitted information indicatingthat the RVP program is necessary to achieve attainment as expeditiouslyas practicable in these upstate areas. This information reveals that noother measures could be implemented rapidly enough to provide any significantemission reductions by the summer of 1989, and available measures whichwould produce emission reductions of similar magnitude to the RVP programcould not be in place for several years. The upstate areas already havein place reasonably available control technology (RACT) for stationarysources consistent with EPA's Group I and Group II Control Technique Guidelines(CTGs) as a result of previous nonattainment designations. New York couldimpose RACT on Group III CTG sources, institute a vehicle inspection andmaintenance program, require Stage II vapor controls, and other extraodinarycontrols such as regulating consumer solvents. However, New York has indicatedthat none of these measures could be in place before 1992 and most wouldtake significantly longer to produce emission reductions similar to thatof the RVP program.The State has estimated that reductions in upstate areas from the RVP programare expected to be in the range of 26,500 tpy. Although New York is notyet in a position to make a demonstration of attainment for these areas,pending the development of inventories and the use of computer modeling,New York currently believes that the RVP program alone may be sufficientto provide for attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the upstate nonattainmentareas. New York therefore concludes that implementation of the RVP programnow is necessary to achieve the standard as expeditiously as practicablein these areas.In light of the State's submitted analysis and the fact that New York doesnot currently have a nonattainment demonstration for the upstate nonattainmentcounties listed above, EPA cannot now conclude that the RVP program isnot necessary to achieve the standard as expeditiously as practicable inthose areas.\2\<NOTE/> Until EPA is in a position to conclude that the program isdefinitely not necessary, the Agency believes it is appropriate to makea finding under section 211(c)(4)(C) with respect to the RVP program inthe upstate nonattainment areas. EPA therefore proposes today to make sucha finding. Further, it appears that since the upstate nonattainment areasare located geographically all over the State, New York logistically hadto make the RVP rule apply on a statewide basis in order to ensure compliancein the nonattainment areas without producing supply and distribution problems.Given New York's need to apply the RVP program statewide, EPA finds thatapplication of the program throughout the State is necessary to achievethe ozone standard as expeditiously as practicable in all of the upstateand downstate nonattainment areas.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Although EPA indicated in its national RVP rulemakingthat control to 9.0 psi would not be practicable for implementation before1992 nationwide March 22, 1989 (54 FR 11868), EPA must conclude, basedupon the record underlying New York's actual adoption of a 9.0 psi RVPprogram in 1989, that such a program is currently practicable in New York.EPA acknowledges that the technical data to support its 211(c)(4)(C) findingfor the upstate areas are not extensive given the late date at which theupstate nonattainment problem became apparent. EPA therefore specificallyrequests comment on the propriety of its 211(c)(4)(C) finding for the upstatenonattainment areas.<ITAG tagnum="84">Enforceability </ITAG>In EPA's review of the enforceability of the New York revision, a problemwith the test methods section was revealed. The State requires that fuelsampling and testing shall be ``by methods acceptable to the Commissioner.''EPA has adopted a final volatility rule which contains the American Societyfor Testing and Materials (ASTM) method D-4057 for bottle sampling, themethod contained in the California Administrative Code Title 13, R.2261for nozzle sampling and ASTM ``dry'' method D-4814, Annex 2 (formerly knownas P-176) or the Herzog ``dry'' method as a test method. The State hascommitted to revise this section in order to resolve this issue. EPA isproposing to approve the State's RVP controls with the understanding thatthe State must revise the test methods section to include the EPA recognizedmethods. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve this revision to the New York State ImplementationPlan for ozone to control gasoline volatility with the understanding thatthe State will revise the test method section of the regulation. EPA isalso proposing to make a finding that this SIP revision meets the requirementsof section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Act for an exception to Federal preemption.EPA is soliciting public comments on its proposed action. Comments willbe considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participatein the Federal rulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to theaddress noted at the beginning of today's notice. This notice is issued as required by section 110 of the Clean Air Act,as amended. The Administrator's decision regarding the approval of thisplan revision is based on its meeting the requirements of section 110 ofthe Clean Air Act, and 40 CFR Part 51. Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709) The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 </ITAG>Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Ozone.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: February 24, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William J.
