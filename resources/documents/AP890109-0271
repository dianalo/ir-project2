Yet this sparsely populated land the size of Western Europeis 100 percent literate, and inching its way toward modernity. Nowit is taking a leaf from the Soviet Union to speed the process.</TEXT><TEXT/><NOTE>By JIM ABRAMS</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Like its huge and dominant neighborto the north, this ancient nation of herdsmen and miners, once ruledby Genghis Khan, is restructuring its Marxist society.   But what the Soviets call perestroika, the Mongolians call``shinechel'' or renewal. And they are greeting the liberation ofthe state-controlled economy and the infusion of democracy with anair of excitement.   The old ways brought shortages in a land of plenty and politicaltimidity to a people of great warrior tradition.   Shinechel is still too new to claim many accomplishments, butthere are great expectations.   ``Before, we said that capitalism and socialism can't existtogether,'' says Puntagdasyn Luvsandorj, director of the Instituteof Economics of the State Planning Committee. ``Now we say they mustcooperate.''   The main target of reform is the state monopoly on productionimposed in the 1960s on both industry and, more improbably, in ruralareas where people are scattered across a nation nearly the size ofWestern Europe, wandering the grasslands as semi-nomadic herdsmen.   One consequence is that livestock numbers have stagnated at about23 million head since the early 1970s even though the humanpopulation has doubled, to about 2 million.   Half of the meat produced must be exported to the Soviet Union topay for Soviet goods and financial aid, leaving city residents tostand in line, sometimes for hours, for scarce supplies of meat, thestaple of the Mongolian diet.   More than half the population has left the harsh life on thegrasslands for cities, putting further strains on food supplies.   ``The food situation is getting worse,'' said one foreigndiplomat, noting that grain and vegetable farms, all run by thestate, are plagued by ``bad planning, bad management and badprofits.''   The government is now trying to spur meat production byincreasing the private stocks herdsmen are allowed to keep. Those inthe Gobi desert region can now keep 100 head, while those in otherparts of the country can keep 75. Farmers may now work small privateplots.   Industry has fared better because of heavy investment andtechnical assistance from the Soviet Union and other socialistnations, helping Mongolia develop its rich mineral resources.   In December, Mongolia's parliament passed an industrial lawgiving factory directors greater authority over planning andinvestment. But it's three strikes and you're out. The governmentwill bail out money-losing enterprises only two times before theyare shut down.   ``Before, we didn't participate in selling our product, so wewere not interested in quality and meeting world competition,'' saidChimedeeren Erdenechimeg, general engineer at a carpet factory inUlan Bator. ``Now, according to the new law, if we produce a goodproduct and can find a market, the living conditions of the managersand workers will improve.''   Free markets, encouraged by the government, are still small butgrowing. Owners of private cars have gone into the taxi service, afew small restaurants have appeared and private clothesmakers areselling to retail cooperatives.   But the pace of economic change is likely to be slow, said oneforeign diplomat. ``It's such a vast country,'' he said, and ``thereis little pressure from below for privatization'' because people arerelatively prosperous and have known nothing but socialism since theMarxist state was founded in 1921, only four years after the Russianrevolution, making it the second oldest Marxist society in the world.   Faster change may come in the political sphere, where the rulingCommunist Party is debating an election law that for the first timewill allow direct multi-candidate elections.   The party is also trying to limit the role of party officials topolicy-making, and streamline the government. ``Marx and Lenin saidthe roles of the party, the government and mass organizations shouldbe separate,'' said Kinayat Zardihan, a leading ideologist in theparty's Institute of Social Sciences. ``But in our country thisdifference has disappeared.''   As in the Soviet Union, the official press is encouraged tocondemn what are now regarded as errors of the past. The press nowspeaks openly about repression and political purges in the 1930s.Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal, ruler for 40 years until his ouster in 1984,is knocked for forcing collectivization in the 1960s while hisRussian wife is criticized for wielding too much power.   Statues in Ulan Bator of Stalin, and other native oppressors,have recently been smeared with paint.   Zardihan said the party is now rewriting the nation's history toinclude the truth about events that have shaped the nation.   One government official noted that before now everything thathappened before 1921 was regarded as bad, including the 12th and13th century advance of Genghis Khan's horsemen that created aMongol Empire stretching from the Danube to the coast of China.   President and party leader Jambyn Batmonh, a 62-year-old formerrector of the state university, is also hoping to ease his remoteand landlocked nation away from its near total dependence on theSoviet Union and other Soviet bloc nations.   Relations with China, with which Mongolia shares a 2,900-mileborder, show signs of improvement as Moscow and Beijing patch up olddifferences. Mongolia, which sided with the Soviet Union when itstwo giant neighbors split in 1960, sent home one division of Soviettroops in 1987 and has now pledged to remove a ``considerablenumber'' of the remaining 50,000 Soviet troops guarding Mongoliafrom a potential Chinese attack.   In early 1987, Mongolia and the United States establisheddiplomatic relations and are now negotiating cultural and consularagreements.   Currently 97 percent of Mongolia's total annual trade of about$1.6 billion is with socialist countries, 80 percent with the SovietUnion. Those figures will be hard to change in the near future.Mongolia receives about a billion dollars in aid and two-thirds ofits capital investment funds from the Soviet Union every year, whichlocks it into shipping its ores, cashmere and meat to the socialistbloc.   Officially, at least, Mongolians are full of praise for theSoviet Union, which helped build its cities and industry.   Under Soviet-style socialism, Mongolia has become a nation ofalmost 100 percent literacy where 25 percent receive highereducations. Medical and other welfare facilities are inexpensive andworker incomes average nearly 200 dollars a month, one of the higherfigures in Asia.</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
