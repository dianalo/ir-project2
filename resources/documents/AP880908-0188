Policymakers risk worsening other pollution if they attack asingle pollutant, said James MacKenzie and Mohammed El-Ashry, theauthors of a report for the World Resources Institute.   For example, current strategies to reduce urban ozone could beincreasing ozone in rural areas, said MacKenzie.   The Environmental Protection Agency disagreed with thatconclusion.   The World Resources Institute study said crop losses could be aslarge as $5 billion a year from ozone, but they were unable toestimate monetary damages to forests.   Dying trees in the East, primarily some pines in the Southeastand red spruce in the Appalachian Mountains, probably are beingkilled by the interaction of ozone and the sulfuric and nitricacids in acid rain, they said.   Ozone in rural areas throughout the country appears to beroughly twice the normal background level, the study said. At highaltitudes in the East it sometimes reaches concentrations the EPAhas defined as unhealthy in cities.   The American Paper Institute said it was awaiting a responsefrom its experts before commenting on the report. In the past, theinstitute has said it has seen no evidence that trees its membercompanies rely on are being harmed by air pollution.   Like several other environmental groups, the World ResourcesInstitute argued for a 10-million ton reduction in annual emissionsof the raw material for sulfuric acid, sulfur dioxide, from powerplant and industrial boilers, and a 5-million ton reduction innitrogen dioxide emissions, the raw material for nitric acid, fromboilers and motor vehicles. The two acids are the major componentsof acid rain.   ``We should avoid taking action that corrects one problem at theexpense of others,'' said El-Ashry.   For example, he said utilities should not be forced to installexpensive ``scrubbers'' to remove sulfur dioxide from smokestacks,as the current Clean Air Act requires for new plants.   ``That actually works against the carbon dioxide problem and thegreenhouse effect (warming of the earth),'' he said. Therequirement works to lock in coal to the boilers in question``rather than allowing fuel switching,'' which would use fuels thatemit less carbon dioxide in burning and thus cause less warming ofthe earth.   Another example is EPA's focus on reducing emissions of oneurban precursor of ozone, reactive hydrocarbons like unburnedgasoline, and ignoring the other precursor, nitrogen oxides,MacKenzie said.   ``Those nitrogen oxides will generate ozone in the countrysideand that still comes down as nitric acid,'' he said in arguing thatboth should be reduced together.   The way the chemistry is believed to work, a reduction of urbannitrogen oxides or a simultaneous reduction of both nitrogen oxidesand hydrocarbons might increase ozone in some urban areas, saidJennifer Logan, an atmospheric chemist at Harvard University.   Informed of her view, MacKenzie said such an effect is possiblein some areas, and, ``You have to be careful'' to make reductionsin such ways to avoid it.   The report cited recent research showing that as little as 1part per billion of nitrogen oxides in forests can form largeamounts of ozone from the hydrocarbons emitted by trees, isopreneand the terpene family of compounds.   Ms. Logan said 35 percent of nitrogen oxides are believed tooriginate in small cities or rural areas.   Without new control measures, nitrogen oxides are projected toincrease in coming decades, and ``this means more ozone damage tothe forests,'' MacKenzie said.   Gerald Emisson, head of EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning andStandards at Research Triangle Park, N.C., said that with computermodels, ``When we have looked at the Northeastern United States ona very crude scale, we don't see big ozone contrations taking placeif you don't control nitrogen oxides ... Very tentative results donot lead us to say there's a big problem in the forests.''</TEXT></DOC>
