The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited Chrysler's Newark, Del., assembly plant for 811 alleged violations. The penalty was the largest in OSHA's history and the second major agency fine involving Chrysler in recent months.    The fine is part of an increased OSHA campaign in recent months to crack down on employer violations, reversing a deregulatory trend in which the Reagan administration had slowed enforcement efforts.    Chrysler agreed to pay the fine without admitting guilt as to the alleged violations. The company could have contested the citations before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, an independent agency, but said it decided not to.    In a statement, Chrysler Motors Corp.'s chairman, Gerald Greenwald, said the company has been cooperating with the OSHA investigation &quot;and has already acted on the majority of items.&quot; He added, &quot;We are working on others.&quot; Chrysler Motors is the company unit that oversees the auto makers' vehicle production and sales.    Mr. Greenwald said &quot;most of the items&quot; involved &quot;relatively minor electrical and mechanical safeguarding discrepancies and a majority have been addressed.&quot; He added that Chrysler &quot;retains the right to disagree with OSHA over specific allegations at Newark. These are issues that we will have to resolve with the agency as soon as possible.&quot;    The fine comes on the heels of another blotch on Chrysler's image -- the recent federal indictment charging its Chrysler Motors unit and two executives with selling as new more than 60,000 cars and trucks that company managers had driven with the odometers disconnected. Chrysler has acknowledged the odometer practice and extended warranties on the affected vehicles, but it denies violating any laws.    In announcing the OSHA penalty, the department highlighted 48 alleged willful violations of regulations requiring manufacturers to notify workers that they may be exposed to dangerous chemicals on the job, along with 225 alleged instances of willful violations of rules concerning overexposure to lead and arsenic. &quot;Willful&quot; violations involve a company's knowingly breaking the rules or being aware of a hazardous condition and making no reasonable effort to correct it.    The notification rules come under an OSHA &quot;hazard communication&quot; standard put into effect between November 1985 and May 1986, as congressional pressure began mounting for a stiffer law governing notification of workers exposed to high levels of chemicals or other possible causes of disease.    OSHA plans to expand the hazard-communication standard for manufacturers so that it covers all employers. A three-judge federal appeals court recently ordered the department to issue the expanded-coverage regulations quickly. The department has appealed the decision to the full appeals court, on the ground that it must contend with other court rulings.    The administration supports a GOP bill in the House that would bolster the hazard-communication standard and require its expansion to cover all work sites.    Meanwhile, the House Labor Committee has approved a bill that would go beyond the OSHA standard, requiring the government or employers to notify all current or former workers who have been exposed to a high-level risk from chemicals, radiation and other hazards. The standards would be based on measurements developed by a new board within the Health and Human Services Department. The Senate Labor Committee plans to take up a similar bill tomorrow.    The newest Chrysler fine takes OSHA beyond citing companies for record-keeping violations, which had been its main enforcement focus in recent months. The string of such charges included proposed fines of $1.3 million against Union Carbide Corp., Danbury, Conn.; $776,000 against Caterpillar Inc., Peoria, Ill.; and $910,000 against Chrysler.    Chrysler later settled that case, agreeing to pay $295,000 without admitting guilt as to charges of violations involving three plants. The company also agreed to correct record-keeping discrepancies at all of its more than 120 U.S. facilities. Union Carbide and Caterpillar are contesting the charges against them. </TEXT></DOC>
