Jamel</HL><DD> 04/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   Prisons are bursting at the seams. New York and other states are spending millions to expand existing facilities and build new ones. The number of men and women being put in cells each month far exceeds the number released. But need this be done in order to maintain public safety?    State prisons, for both moral and economic reasons, should house not marginal, nonviolent criminals, but only those felons who pose a genuine threat to the community. The evidence in New York, at least, is that a wider net is being cast.    Not all of these felons should have gone to prison, and many of them would be better off in community rehabilitative programs. Consider data from the New York state corrections agency indicating that about 24% of the state's prison population is serving terms for nonviolent offenses. (These are prisoners convicted of grand larceny, burglary without a weapon, sale or possession of drugs, forgery and possession of stolen property.) That study further shows that some 40% to 50% of these nonviolent criminals had never been arrested for a violent crime prior to their incarceration period.    Those two screening measures combined would indicate that about 10% to 12% of the inmates had never posed physical harm to another person.    Interestingly, an advisory board appointed by the state Legislature, the Correctional Association of New York, using different criteria found that 12% of people currently imprisoned could have been placed under intensive probation without compromising public safety.    The dollar benefits of community corrections as opposed to state prison confinement are obvious. Using the conservative 12% figure cited above, and based on a New York state prison population of about 39,000 and a building cost of $100,000 per inmate bed, the construction cost equivalent to building facilities for the 4,680 New York state prison inmates unnecessarily confined totals a staggering $468 million. Take the annual cost of confinement for each prisoner (a figure identified by both the New York studies as $26,000 a person) and multiply it by 4,680 and you come up with an additional $121.7 million a year.    (Some might argue that a home burglar, armed or not, is the sort of person society would want confined. Even removing all burglars from the total above and cutting the number of inmates to be released to 6%, however, would still permit a saving in New York state alone of $234 million in construction costs and $60.8 million a year in confinement costs.)    But there is a more important non-economic reason for committing fewer felons to state prison.    Though the need to control certain kinds of criminal activity requires the existence of prisons, some criminologists believe time in prison tends to increase the level of violence perpetrated by a repeat offender and increases his propensity to commit criminal acts. The number of inmates who undergo marked character improvement during imprisonment is low; this is borne out by recent studies of recidivism rates among released criminals.    Younger inmates often have committed such crimes as car theft and possession of stolen property. In some cases, being sent to prison serves to deter young criminals from committing new, more severe crimes upon release. However, in an alarming number of instances, prison is a graduate school, with older, more hardened criminals the instructors. What I saw in prison bore out this long-suspected and cited relationship.    Those who would have us believe that the best, if not only, response to crime is to &quot;get tough&quot; on all criminals ought to consider that according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, at least 20% of all inmates in New York state are released within three years, and more than 90% of all prisoners return to the communities in which they lived before incarceration, and often this means returning to the community in which they committed their original crimes.    One would hope that citizens would prefer to have nonviolent criminals -- who will come back to their communities and share their schools and work places -- punished in a manner that will reinforce respect for socially accepted norms and values, instead of having these people return to the greater society as little more than &quot;graduates&quot; of the prison system.    Such alternative sentences as periodic imprisonment in the local jail, home detention or work release would enable criminals to work and support their families, thereby reducing the tax-burden fostered by welfare. They could also open up additional avenues for restitution to the victims of crime. But the use of probation and other alternative sentencing practices nationwide has declined steadily during the past three years.    As a result of the increasing costs of incarceration, Gov. Mario Cuomo and other New York officials are now considering alternatives to prison sentences. For constructive changes to take place, the states must move away from some of the mandated imprisonments so popular with voters and legislators in recent years. It's time to be more discriminating.    ---   Mr. Jamel, who served more than 10 years at New York's Wallkill Correctional Facility for armed robbery, was an NAACP Prison Program branch president. He was recently released. </TEXT></DOC>
