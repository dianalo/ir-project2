(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Andrew OuldandM;Nearly five months have passed since Allan Loren resigned under pressure fromhis post as president of Apple USA, Apple's domestic marketing and sales arm.andO;The top slot remains vacant -- but not for lack of trying on Apple's part.andM;Apple has offered the job to William Campbell and Charles Boesenberg, bothformer high-level Apple executives, but both have turned Apple down, saysources close to the company and the men involved.andP;  William Coldrick, Apple'ssenior vice president for U.S.andP;  sales, has also turned down the job,according to recent published reports.andM;Boesenberg is now executive vice president of marketing at MIPS ComputerSystems Inc.andP;  Campbell is president of Claris Corp., Apple's softwaresubsidiary.andM;Reached by phone, Boesenberg said it would be inappropriate for him tocomment on the matter.andP;  Campbell and Coldrick did not return calls.andM;Since Jan.andP;  29, Michael Spindler, Apple's newly arrived chief operatingofficer and heir apparent to Apple CEO John Sculley, has been the acting headof Apple USA, based in Cupertino, Calif.andM;Sculley and Spindler were not available for comment, and an Apple spokesmansaid only that the company is &quot;actively recruiting people.&quot;andM;Why is Apple having trouble filling the post?andM;The key factor is Apple's eroding share of the PC market, according to SteveOssad, an analyst with Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco.andP;  &quot;Nobodywants to step in until the market erosion has bottomed out and there's someconviction that the new products will halt that slide,&quot; he said, referring tothe new low-cost Macintoshes expected from Apple later this year.andM;There also aren't a lot of qualified candidates, said Richard Shaffer, editorof the Technologic Computer Letter in New York.andP;  Apple needs someone &quot;whowill make jaws drop,&quot; and &quot;those people are rare,&quot; he said.andM;Most observers don't think the continued vacancy is hurting Apple.andP;  &quot;Thecritical issue for Apple is a low-end Mac,&quot; said Joan-Carol Brigham, ananalyst with International Data Corp., a market-research firm in Framingham,Mass.andP;  Apple's marketing plans are in place, and &quot;their people are outpreaching the gospel,&quot; she added.andM;Despite the widespread belief that Apple will hire someone outside thecompany, the right candidate may be in-house, said Fred Cohen, an analystwith Labe Simpson andamp; Co., an investment firm in New York.andM;Because the next president of Apple USA will have to work closely withSpindler, Cohen thinks Apple will turn to one of its successful managers,such as Ian Diery, who heads Apple Pacific.andP;  Diery, who once headed WangLaboratories Inc.'s U.S.andP;  operations, has received good marks for his joboverseeing Apple's efforts in Asia, Latin America and Canada.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
