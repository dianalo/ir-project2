Sherwin keeps a chess board in hisoffice at GAF Corp. with the white pieces arranged in a cautiousopening strategy known as the Samish Variation against the King'sIndian Defense.   Careful, analytical, a risk-taker only when odds are good,Sherwin's chess style doesn't square with the charges against him infederal court: that he broke federal law by trying to manipulate theprice of a company's stock.   Once the third-ranked U.S. chess player and still a prominentfigure in the chess world, the GAF vice chairman faces real-lifecheckmate as a key defendant in the first jury trial emanating fromthe Wall Street insider trading scandal. He has denied the chargesand vowed to vindicate himself in court. But if convicted on allcounts, Sherwin could get 50 years in prison and fines up to $2.5million.   ``You walk into an office and you see a chess set and you wonderif he beat himself,'' said Charles J. Rose, an analyst with theOppenheimer andamp; Co. investment firm, who knows Sherwin personally.   In a recent session of the trial in U.S. District Court in lowerManhattan, Sherwin sat intently at the defense table, scrutinizingdamning testimony by Boyd L. Jefferies, a disgraced stockbroker andadmitted felon who is the government's key witness in the GAF case.   Jefferies alleged Sherwin asked him by telephone in October 1986to buy Union Carbide Corp. stock in order to artificially inflatethe price, and that Sherwin agreed to compensate him for any losses.Under federal securities laws, the telephone calls alone would havebeen illegal.   The purpose of the alleged deal was to maximize GAF's gain fromthe sale of its holding in Carbide stock after a failed takeover ofthe much larger chemical company.   Friends, corporate analysts and chess colleagues were dumbfoundedwhen Sherwin was indicted along with GAF last July, saying thecharges belie his character.   ``He's as likely to do something dishonest as he is to flap hisarms and fly home across the Hudson River,'' said Allen Kaufman,executive director of the American Chess Foundation, who has knownSherwin for 40 years.   ``The funniest thing about this thing is I can't imagine JimSherwin doing what he has allegedly done,'' added chemical industryanalyst Mark Gulley of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``It just does notadd up.''   Sherwin, 55, declined through his lawyers to be interviewedduring the trial. But associates describe him as deeply analytical,articulate, self-effacing and cautious both in the office and behinda chess board.   At GAF, he was known as a effective administrator who played alesser role in major expenditures. Chess players extoll what theycall his integrity, honesty and intense calm.   Last year, when the Marshall Chess Club in Manhattan wasembroiled in a vote-fraud dispute during board elections, membersturned to Sherwin as an arbiter. Another time, colleagues recall,Sherwin gave free legal defense to a club member involved in afistfight over a chess game.   Sherwin grew up in the Bronx, playing chess from an early age. Heentered Columbia College at age 16 and went to law school there. Atage 21, Sherwin and Kaufman hitchhiked cross-country to play in atournament in California.   Golombek's Encyclopedia of Chess includes a listing on Sherwin,describing him as ``a leading American international master in the1950s and 1960s.''   Sherwin tied for fifth in the 1953 world junior championships andplaced 17th in a world championships preliminary five years later ina tournament that included playing companion Bobby Fischer, who wenton to become the world's best player. Fischer included a 1957 gameagainst Sherwin in his book, ``My 60 Memorable Games.''   In the late-1950s Sherwin placed third in the U.S. championshipstwo years running, but after that his results fluctuated, accordingto Golombek's, and he rarely played competitively after 1968,choosing business over chess.   ``He doubtlessly would have gone to the top had he chosen chessas a profession,'' Kaufman said.   ``His style is assertive, determined but sound,'' he said. ``Hewon't go off on the flights of fancy the way lesser players do. Heanalyzes very, very accurately and deeply and always gets into timepressure because of that.''   The description also applies to Sherwin's business style. In 1960he joined GAF, the Wayne, N.J.-based maker of specialty chemicalsand building materials that also owns WNCN-FM in New York. Hepatiently rose through the corporate ranks under the tutelage ofJesse Werner, GAF's prior chairman.   In the early-1980s, Sherwin led a failed fight to prevent atakeover of GAF by the current chairman, Samuel J. Heyman, accordingto analysts. He left the company in 1983 for a senior post atTriangle Industries Inc. just before Heyman triumphed, but returneda year later after assiduous courting by Heyman.   Analysts said Sherwin has played a principal role in law,accounting, tax and staff support matters that helped increaseprofits and raise the company's stature.   ``He showed Heyman how to make the company profitable,'' analystRose said.   Though he no longer plays chess competitively, Sherwin ispresident of the American Chess Foundation, offers chess analysis onpublic television for world championship matches and stops by theMarshall Chess Club to play, as recently as a few weeks ago.   ``He always wants to find out what the right move is. He wants tofind out the truth of the chess position,'' said Shelby Lyman, asyndicated chess columnist who has hosted championship broadcastswith Sherwin six times since 1978.   ``He's a guy who would do his own income tax and never cheat.He's been so successful all his life just playing by the rules,''Lyman said.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday, Feb. 19.</NOTE></DOC>
