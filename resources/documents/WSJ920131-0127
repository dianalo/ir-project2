Thesporting goods industry, holding its annual Super Show inAtlanta this weekend, is resigned to slower growth now andyears into the future.   The Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association projectssales will rise 5% this year to $33.14 billion. That isn'tmuch better than last year's estimated 4.4% increase, and iswell below the double-digit gains of the 1980s. Worse yet,sporting goods manufacturers and retailers expect annualgrowth to average just 2% to 3% over the next 10 to 20 years,a recent survey by consultants Kurt Salmon Associates found.   &quot;The market isn't growing,&quot; says Scott Reda, a distributorin Easton, Pa. &quot;We're just fighting for the same customers.&quot;   The industry depends increasingly on fashion whims.Booming sales of apparel with team logos and trendy soccerwear will prop up the industry's growth this year, says JohnHoran, editor of the trade newsletter Sporting GoodsIntelligence.   Other merchandise won't fare as well. The recession andworries about unemployment have hurt leisure spending. Newhightech products, such as a $125 superlight baseball bat,are often too costly to sell well in hard times. Sales ofsports equipment are flat, Mr. Horan says. And growth insales of athletic shoes has slowed to 4%, he says, from 20%in the '80s.   Tighter leisure budgets and increased emphasis on familymay shift some business toward less expensive sports, evenafter the recession lifts. Alvin Lubetkin, president andchief executive of Oshman's Sporting Goods, a chain based inHouston, expects sales of camping equipment and backyardgames such as badminton and volleyball to rise at least 10%annually. &quot;We'll see a rethinking of how people spend theirleisure time,&quot; he says.                                                                                                          For Olympics Tie-Ins,   Industry Looks to '96                                                                                                          THE BIGGEST sports event of 1992 -- the Olympics -- isn'tsparking the interest of sporting goods manufacturers.   Sales of equipment for sports that are rarely televisedoutside the Olympics, such as volleyball, may benefitslightly from the games, analysts say. But overall, theindustry isn't paying much attention. The Sporting GoodsManufacturers Association expects only a modest gain in salesaround the Olympics, says president John Riddle.   Given the right conditions, the Olympics can be a boon.Mr. Reda expects industry sales to rise 25% when Atlantaplays host to the 1996 Summer Games.   But this year's Winter and Summer games are both inEurope. And they come at a particularly tough time. As therecession hurts business, retailers are cutting backinventory and manufacturers slowing production. Orders forthis spring are down about 20%, Mr. Reda says.                                                                                                          Soccer Garb, Shoes   Gain a Foothold                                                                                                          SOCCER may still be a poor cousin to football and basketball, but the soccer look is holding its own off the field.   Soccer fashion &quot;is big business,&quot; says Oshman's Mr.Lubetkin. &quot;Maybe 10% of the customers go to the field. Mostwear it because it looks good.&quot;   There's a burgeoning market for baggy soccer shorts,soccer shoes and post-game sandals. Industry analysts say thesoccer apparel and shoe market totals $425 million to $620million and is growing 10% a year. It should get a big boostwhen the 1994 World Cup is held in the U.S.   Soccer is the nation's fastest-growing sport, according toa survey of retailers and manufacturers by Kurt SalmonAssociates. High school soccer participation has nearlydoubled in the past decade, as other team sports have seen adecline, says John Briggs Jr., executive director of theSoccer Industry Council of America.   Moreover, the demographics of soccer appeal to marketers.It has broader participant appeal than other big team sports:One-third of soccer players are female. Also, &quot;it's playedmore by the daughters and sons of professionals in thesuburbs,&quot; says Ian McLaren, president of Umbro USA, thenation's biggest maker of soccer equipment.   Umbro's sales more than doubled in 1991. People buy soccershorts for &quot;lounging in their house,&quot; swimming, weightliftingand sleeping, Mr. McLaren says.   Black leather soccer shoes (without cleats, made forartificial turf) are also doing well. People wear the shoes&quot;seven days a week,&quot; says Peter Moore, president of PatrickUSA, a manufacturer, whose overall sales grew 22% last year.Its sales of rubber soccer sandals -- more expensive versionsof flip-flops, with an Italian design and massaging conesthat soccer players covet to soothe their soles -- havedoubled in the past two years, he says.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          THE SUPER Show's 200 new products include a few zingers.The Flytrap Fielders Glove, priced at $80, comes with asticky palm, the better to snare screaming liners with.Newman Tackified Glove, in Hoboken, N.J., says it soaks thepalm in a &quot;petrochemical&quot; mixture. . . . One product mightwipe out the post-workout shower. Misty Mate, in Chandler,Ariz., makes a $39 portable air conditioner that straps tothe waist. The two-pound device runs only on pressurizedwater -- no batteries or electricity -- and sprays mist orcool air for up to two hours between fillings. It wasinvented to help construction workers stay on the job in hotweather.</TEXT></DOC>
