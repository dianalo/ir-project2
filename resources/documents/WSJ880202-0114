Ronald Biggs, often called Britain's most famous fugitive, still faces 28 years in Her Majesty's prisons for his part in the 1963 heist of a Glasgow-to-London mail train. The richest train robbery ever pulled off, it yielded 2.6 million pounds, equal to about $7 million then and, with inflation, about $36 million today. But for Mr. Biggs, prison bars seem far away as he gulps milky English tea in his airy apartment high above Rio's scenic coastline and discusses his career.    &quot;I became a crook because I needed the money,&quot; he says. Except for the train robbery, &quot;I could be freezing on some building site, busting my butt as a chippy,&quot; he adds, recalling his former lawful trade of carpentry.    Instead of that, Mr. Biggs has achieved a certain status here in Brazil. The tabloids write about him. He owns parts of two nightclubs. He has a young son who is a pop star. He doesn't work.    But 22 years on the lam is a long time. Over Mr. Biggs's kitchen sink hangs an old poster reading &quot;Tour London's Country by Green Coach.&quot; He still speaks in the singsong accent of his South London neighborhood, a kind of British Brooklynese. And he allows that he sometimes misses the &quot;pub atmosphere.&quot; Britain's most famous fugitive is, in fact, a little homesick.    Britain misses Mr. Biggs, too. &quot;He's an escaped prisoner, he's certainly wanted by the authorities here,&quot; says Malcolm Johnson, a spokesman for London's Metropolitan Police Force.    &quot;He's a cheap bloody rascal, a thief,&quot; adds Jack Slipper, recently retired as detective chief superintendent of the force, who spent much of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s tracking the robber.    Yet Mr. Slipper concedes that Mr. Biggs, on the run longer than anybody else Scotland Yard is seeking, &quot;isn't a real professional villain. He never used any violence.&quot; Prior to the train robbery, all he had on his record &quot;were bits and pieces for stealing motorcars and lead&quot; from old-fashioned roofs.    His one spectacular crime came in the wee hours of Aug. 8, 1963, his 34th birthday, when he and his pals grabbed 120 sacks of well-worn bank notes being sent to London for pulping. The engineer was hit over the head by another member of the gang and never worked again. Otherwise, no one was hurt.    The police caught most of the gang within weeks but recovered only about 343,000 pounds of the haul. Most of the other 14 robbers have long since been paroled after serving 10 years or so of their 30-year prison terms. Mr. Biggs was arrested and given a 30-year sentence too, which he began serving in London's Wandsworth prison.    But one afternoon about two years later, some friends drove up outside the prison wall in a converted furniture van. They opened a specially built door in its roof, scaled the wall and tossed a rope ladder over it. Mr. Biggs scampered up and was gone.    Liberty didn't come cheap. Mr. Biggs says he paid his friends with the van 15,000 pounds of his 137,000-pound share of the robbery money. And to elude the international hunt that followed, he shelled out an additional 40,000 pounds for plastic surgery in Paris, a new passport and a fresh start in Australia as a carpenter. &quot;In those days that was enough to buy several four-bedroom houses,&quot; he says.    Within a year his wife and two children traveled secretly to join him. But the British police traced him, and after further aliases failed to throw them off the scent, Mr. Biggs fled through Panama and Venezuela to Brazil. His wife, tired of running, stayed in Australia.    By then, Mr. Biggs says, his loot was gone, some spent and some given to friends. &quot;When you've 'ad a good tickle, you take care of your pals who aren't so lucky,&quot; he says with a smile. On arriving in Rio in 1970, &quot;I was poor as a church mouse. I 'ad about $195. I hawked my watch.&quot;    Charm and luck came to the rescue. &quot;If you want to get on in Brazil, you've got to learn to dance the samba,&quot; he says. Not long after arriving here, he was doing just that at a Rio nightclub when he met a local woman, Raimunda. They set up housekeeping.    Britain and Brazil had no extradition treaty, and local sympathy for Mr. Biggs and his pregnant girlfriend, combined with uncertainties over whether Britain would return Brazilian political dissidents living there, allowed him to remain outside Scotland Yard's net. For a few years Mr. Biggs earned a meager existence, doing carpentry work again. Then in 1977 things really took off.    Argentine and Japanese television crews interviewed him that year, and Mr. Biggs became a well-known figure in the expatriate community. He was invited to parties. The papers wrote about him. Before long, he had made a record with a British punk-rock group, the Sex Pistols, titled &quot;A Punk Prayer: No One Is Innocent.&quot;    But the British wouldn't let him alone. In 1979 a group of British former servicemen turned up in Rio and befriended him. He narrowly avoided their attempt to abduct him and drag him back to Britain.    Two years later the same group came again. This time they did kidnap him and took him by yacht to Barbados. But after he had spent two weeks in immigration and four more in prison there, a legal technicality blocked his extradition to Britain. He went back to Rio.    Since then, Mr. Biggs's position has become more secure. Though Brazil's relations with Britain have improved, the country agreed in 1981 to let Mr. Biggs stay to look after his and Raimunda's son, Michael. Raimunda has moved out but often stops by to visit.    The agreement forbids Mr. Biggs to work or own property, he says, so the Rio apartment belongs to Michael, now 13. The boy has been a big help in other ways, too. In 1981 he recorded a doe-eyed television appeal for his father that &quot;touched the hearts of the Brazilian public,&quot; Mr. Biggs says. It also caught the eye of a CBS executive, who offered the seven-year-old a recording contract. Now several gold and platinum disks hang on the wall.    His father is getting more famous, too. A Swiss-backed company has just finished a $2.5 million movie, &quot;Prisoner of Rio,&quot; about the attempts to kidnap him. The first countries where it will be released are Spain and Japan. He has also done joint interviews by satellite with Mr. Slipper for British, Australian and Japanese television. And he will be the co-author of a book of saucy humor, &quot;The Bedside Biggsy.&quot;    It's a very different fate from what befell his accomplices. Many of them have &quot;been in and out {of prison} like jack-in-the-boxes&quot; over the years, he says, adding with a chuckle, &quot;The only one who managed to get rehabilitated is old Biggsy.&quot;    Yet there are regrets. He says he is sorry about the engineer who got clobbered and also about recruiting an old man into the gang to drive the train. &quot;He'd never done anything wrong in his life,&quot; Mr. Biggs says. As it happened, the old man, lacking a criminal record, was the only one of the 15 who never got caught.    Mr. Biggs suspects he may see Britain again someday. Oh, he doesn't &quot;nurse hopes&quot; about it, he quickly adds.    But Jack Slipper expects him back. &quot;I've got a feeling that once the son gets of age, he will put himself in the hands of the British public,&quot; the old sleuth says. &quot;He likes fish and chips, jellied eels and all that sort of stuff, you know. He'd give anything to get back to London. To South London, in particular.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
