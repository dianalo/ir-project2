Researchers examining lung cancer tumors discovered a series ofabnormalities in the so-called p53 anti-cancer gene, according to areport Tuesday by Dr. John Minna of the National CancerInstitute-Navy Medical Oncology Branch in Bethesda, Md.   Defects in the gene also have been linked to colon cancer, to anuncommon bone cancer called osteogenic sarcoma and to chronicmyelogenous leukemia, Minna said.   ``Obviously, everybody is going to be looking for it ineverything else,'' Minna said.   Bert Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, whoidentified p53 abnormalities in colon cancer, said: ``From whatI've heard of Dr. Minna's work, it seems quite clear that the p53gene will play an important role in lung tumors.   ``Current evidence suggests that p53 is likely to play a role inmany common cancers,'' including breast cancer, ovarian cancer andbladder cancer, he said.   During the past few years, researchers have found indirectevidence that defects in at least six genes can contribute to lungcancer, which afflicts an estimated 150,000 Americans a year.   The new study has pinpointed chemical changes in one of thosegenes. That should be useful for identifying people at high risk ofgetting lung cancer, or for predicting how deadly a particular caseof lung cancer will be, Minna said.   ``One thing you could do would be to take people's tumors, seehow many (genetic) lesions they have, and determine how virulentthey are,'' Minna said Tuesday in a telephone interview fromToronto, where he presented his findings at the Bristol-MyersCancer Research Symposium.   Vogelstein has found that the more genetic abnormalities a coloncancer tumor has, the more virulent it is, Minna said.   Minna said he is beginning studies to determine if the samething is true in lung cancer.   Determination of a tumor's virulence could lead to betterdecisions on treatment, he said.   Minna also said screening for genetic abnormalities in peoplewho don't have lung cancer could reveal those who are about to getcancer _ that is, people who have some, but not all, of the geneticchanges needed to produce a tumor. Such people could be followedclosely for the appearance of tumors, he said.   The protein made by the p53 gene, located on chromosome 17,normally protects the body against cancer. If the protein isdefective, the protective effect is lost and one step has beentaken toward the formation of a tumor, Minna explained. The gene iscalled an anti-cancer gene because it normally protects againstcancer.   Minna said that although only six genetic abnormalities have sofar been linked to lung cancer, there may be as many as 10 or 20.   Most of the evidence for the six abnormalities already foundconsists of studies with genetic ``signposts'' called restrictionfragment length polymorphisms. These studies show the approximatelocation of the abnormalities on chromosomes, but do not revealprecisely what the abnormalities are.   The p53 gene is the second anti-cancer gene to be carefullystudied, Minna said. The first was a gene identified inretinoblastoma, a rare children's eye cancer. The retinoblastomagene also was shown recently to be important in lung cancer, Minnasaid.</TEXT></DOC>
