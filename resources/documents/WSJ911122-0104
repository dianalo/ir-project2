They're pushed around,stepped on and even shut out.   But Mark Weinberg never thought he would wind up in jail.Of course, Mr. Weinberg didn't quite know what to expect whenhe took on a real big leaguer: the Chicago Blackhawks hockeyempire.</LP><TEXT>   The former lawyer and his partner Mark Finch, both 29years old, publish the Blue Line, a brash, breezy -- andstrictly unofficial -- program for Blackhawk games. Hoping toexpand into programs for other sports, they figure that thetypical official program is a dull and expensive product, andthat a feisty competitor will find a ready market.   A typical issue carries newsy tidbits on the opposing teamand lists extensive, updated statistics about both teams,players' salaries and referees. Little of that appears inGoal, the National Hockey League's 72-page magazine. The BlueLine, published twice a week, also sports a regular scorecard of players' fights, with ratings of &quot;bloody nose,&quot;&quot;black eye,&quot; &quot;bruised ego,&quot; or &quot;just dancing.&quot;   Fans snap up nearly 900 copies of the Blue Line at mosthome games. Readers particularly relished the Halloweenissue, featuring a cut-out mask of controversial head coachMike Keenan that was captioned: &quot;Scare All Your Neighbors]&quot;   The hockey team's management isn't amused, however, andmakes life difficult for the maverick entrepreneurs. The paircan't get Blackhawk press credentials. They aren't allowed todistribute their six-page, magazine-sized pamphlet insideChicago Stadium, the team's arena. Yet the Blackhawksrecently permitted a rival, Chicago Hockey Weekly, to be soldinside the stadium along with the hockey league's own slickprogram.   Things can get even rougher outside the arena. Once lastseason, police confronted Mr. Weinberg as he hawked his $1programs on the sidewalk and then jailed him for obstructingpedestrian traffic. Released on $50 bond an hour later, Mr.Weinberg complained to a city official. The police haven'tbothered him since.   Now in their second season of publication, Messrs.Weinberg and Finch find that building a business with stayingpower depends on how cleverly they deal with such setbacks,seize opportunities and avoid costly legal tussles.   They have one thing in their favor: highly loyal Blackhawkfans. Many readers are upset with the team's management. Forinstance, as fans filed into the Blackhawks' Nov. 7 gameagainst the Quebec Nordiques, several expressed ire overticket-price increases of as much as 87% over the past threeyears.   The Blue Line reports such discontent. A recent issuefeatured a photographic layout, titled &quot;Dollar Bill RidesAgain,&quot; depicting Blackhawks owner Bill Wirtz's face on adollar bill. &quot;Exhibits&quot; displayed alongside the bill includeda box-seat ticket with its $50 price circled.   The Blue Line prints &quot;what the real fans think,&quot; saysMatthew Stanis, a 31-year-old accountant, sporting a teamjacket, sweatshirt and cap.   To produce the Blue Line, Messrs. Weinberg and Finchinvested $12,000 in desk-top publishing equipment in two tinyhome offices. Each issue costs about $600, includingprinting, graphics, distribution and other expenses. Theycollect about $1,140 per issue. Most of that -- an average ofabout $890 -- comes from program sales; the rest comes fromthree advertisers, including brewer Adolph Coors Co. Eachpartner pockets about $540 a week from their two issues,enough to cover the bachelors' living expenses and littleelse.   When the current season began, Mr. Weinberg's biggest fearwas the 20-page Chicago Hockey Weekly, a publication based inDenver. The Blackhawks permit arena sales of the magazine inexchange for a free full-page ad promoting the hockey team'ssportswear.   But Mr. Weinberg was able to take advantage of anunexpected development. The Blackhawks, concerned that the$2-a-copy Chicago Hockey Weekly might hurt sales of theleague's $3 Goal magazine, insisted that vendors sell themtogether for $5. Hawkers of the Blue Line can exploit the $4gap between that price and the price of the maverick program.   Out on the sidewalk, Mr. Finch seeks to attract fans byrepeatedly engaging in a hawking routine with a friendlypeanut vendor. &quot;Blue Line] One dollar]&quot; the entrepreneurhollers.   The vendor shouts back, &quot;How much does Wirtz get?&quot;   &quot;Not a penny]&quot; yells Mr. Finch.   The lack of Blackhawk press credentials does hurt,however. The Blue Line can't interview team players. It alsohas trouble obtaining statistic-laden media guides from otherNHL teams, which let the Blackhawks distribute them to theaccredited local press.   Jim DeMaria, the Blackhawks' spokesman, says the Blue Lineoffers useful information but doesn't merit the team'sendorsement. &quot;Personally,&quot; he adds, &quot;I think some of thethings they've done were in poor taste.&quot; He cites a recentissue depicting a photo of Mr. Keenan superimposed over atoilet.   The undaunted partners, friends since kindergarten, hopethat they'll eventually convince the Blackhawks to open up.Mr. Finch, a former marketer for a Wisconsin dog-racingtrack, attempts to build rapport with Mr. DeMaria by droppingoff copies of the latest issue at the team spokesman's officebefore each game. Mr. DeMaria says he won't change his mind.   The entrepreneurs aim to expand into other sports. &quot;It'snot a business with just one program,&quot; says Mr. Weinberg. Hehas his eye on local professional baseball games -- whichdraw crowds close to twice the size of those accommodated bythe Blackhawks' 17,317-seat arena.   Last summer, the partners experimented with a White Soxprogram. Worried that team security guards might hassle themwhile they hawked their programs, the businessmen soughtadvice from the Center for Individual Rights. The pro bonolaw firm in Washington, D.C., wrote and asked the White Soxto leave its clients alone.   Howard C. Pizer, the team's executive vice president,agreed. &quot;We believe it is in everyone's best interest,&quot; hisreply says, &quot;to avoid a dispute . . .&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
