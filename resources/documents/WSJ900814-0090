Citing &quot;corruption and nepotism in thefederal government,&quot; military-backed President Ghulam IshaqKhan dissolved Ms. Bhutto's government last week, appointedan interim prime minister and set new elections for October24.   Though the claims of &quot;corruption&quot; and &quot;nepotism&quot; on Ms.Bhutto's watch are certainly well-founded, the recentactivities undertaken by the Pakistani security forces havethemselves advanced beyond legitimacy, or so it would appear.The result is harassment of not only those associated withMs. Bhutto, but a crackdown on any dissent in the country.</LP><TEXT>   The police have started to round up many of Ms. Bhutto'skey associates and supporters. Ms. Bhutto's mother washarassed by security forces when she tried to leave thecountry on a plane to London. A newspaper executive and foursenior journalists were arrested last Saturday. By somelights, the country is in a virtual state of martial law.   Interim Prime Minister Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi has deniedthat the arrests are political. But one can't help feelingunease about the current weeding out of &quot;corruption&quot; and theimposition of &quot;order&quot; in Pakistan. The Pakistani military,despite its denials of involvement, seems to be the invisibleforce behind Ms. Bhutto's ouster and the subsequent crackdownon her supporters.   Under the rubric of ridding the government of corruption,the military had taken over Pakistan's government five timesbefore the dissolution of the Bhutto government. Ms. Bhuttosaid right after the announcement of this recent dissolution,&quot;They have done it again.&quot;   The military is miffed over Ms. Bhutto's meddling in its&quot;internal affairs,&quot; her handling of the ethnic strife inSind, and her search for a political solution in Afghanistan.But while there can be legitimate complaints about herpolicies and her management of government, Pakistan's votersare entitled to decide for themselves whether she continuesor, if not, who her replacement will be. It is going to behard for anyone to regard the coming election as a fair oneif the contenders continue to be subject to arrest andintimidation by the security forces. Indeed, the arrests andproposed trials of prominent Bhutto backers will themselvesbe suspect if they come to be regarded as political arrestsrather than actions based on genuine evidence of corruption.That will hardly serve either the cause of democracy orjustice.   This ouster seems to have been done &quot;by the book,&quot; orpursuant to the Pakistani constitution, though there might begrounds for challenging President Ghulam Ishaq Khan's actionsin court -- a course of action Ms. Bhutto reportedly willtake. The Pakistani courts and the political arena -- whennew elections are finally held -- are the forums in whichPakistan's problems should be worked out. The laws of theland and the voice of the Pakistani people -- not theimposition of the military's will -- are the only legitimatemeans to the ultimate end, which is the salvation ofPakistan's fragile democracy.   Pakistan's problems are many, to be sure, involving notonly bad government management but dangers of seriousconflicts pitting Islamic fundamentalists in rural areasagainst more sophisticated urban dwellers. But those problemscan only be solved through democratic processes, not bystrong-arm actions.</TEXT></DOC>
