George Benoit, chairman of Matthews andamp; Wright, acknowledged that the firm has been contacted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission and a U.S. attorney's office regarding the underwritings, which include a $335 million offering for Chester, Pa.    An investigator for the office of the Comptroller of the Currency asserted that the Chester bonds were placed with a &quot;non-existent bank&quot; that had &quot;no money.&quot;    Mr. Benoit, who contended that the issues in question &quot;are valid&quot; said the Chester transaction occurred Aug. 29, 1986, to beat a tax deadline and the bonds were sold in a private placement to the Commercial Bank of the Americas, based in Saipan, a part of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. trust territory in the Pacific.    The Bond Buyer, a trade newspaper, reported last Friday that the tax-exempt status of five other issues underwritten by Matthews andamp; Wright also were being scrutinized by federal authorities.    According to the publication, the issues are a $125 million offering for the Sac and Fox Tribes of Oklahoma; a $500 million underwriting for East Chicago Heights, Ill.; a $300 million issue for the Industrial Development Board of the Pacific nation of Palau, and two issues totaling $349 million for East St. Louis, Ill.    The underwriter's parent, Matthews andamp; Wright Group Inc., went public last August, selling 1.5 million shares at $11 each. Yesterday, the firm's stock had a delayed opening on the American Stock Exchange as word circulated about articles in the Philadelphia Inquirer and Barron's magazine concerning the federal investigations. The stock closed in composite trading at $4.625, down $2.125 on volume of 78,900 shares.    A class-action suit filed in a Philadelphia federal court June 19 alleges that the Chester bonds weren't validly offered and sold prior to an Aug. 30, 1986, deadline affecting the tax-exempt status of municipal bonds.    A remarketing of the Chester bonds to the public in October 1986 was &quot;a sham transaction,&quot; leaving the tax-exempt status of the bonds in doubt, the suit alleges.    Internal Revenue Service officials declined to comment on the underwritings under federal scrutiny. But a Treasury official in Washington said, &quot;these are famous deals,&quot; indicating they are well known to tax authorities. Congressional tax experts said the Chester bonds would be taxable if the circumstances of the transaction are as alleged in the class-action suit.    Mr. Benoit said Commercial Bank of the Americas was &quot;a valid corporation&quot; even though it wasn't licensed as a bank at the time of the transaction.    The comptroller's investigator said the bank &quot;never was a bank&quot; but merely &quot;a piece of paper on a registry in Saipan&quot; for a time.    He said that it registered in Saipan as an incorporated business on Jan. 27, 1984, received an offshore banking license on Feb. 13, 1984, and that the license became inoperative on Dec. 31, 1984.    U.S. securities laws and federal rules governing the tax status of municipal bonds apply in the Northern Marianas, where Saipan is located, federal officials said.    The comptroller's investigator said there was no evidence money actually changed hands in the Aug. 29, 1986, Chester transaction, but rather that it was &quot;an accounting exercise.&quot;    Municipal bonds issued after last Aug. 30 are subject to a 1986 Tax Reform Act rule requiring issuers to rebate trading profits to the Treasury, congressional tax experts said. Interest on bonds violating the rule is taxable.    So-called arbitraging by municipalities had been a source of controversy in the municipal securities industry long before it was halted by the 1986 tax act.    Municipalities that weren't ready to proceed with a project for which they had raised funds would reinvest the newly raised money in Treasury bonds for as long as two years. The municipality would then make a profit because it would be earning, for example, 8% on money that it borrowed at 6%. Critics inside and outside the industry came to feel the municipalities were taking unfair advantage of their tax-exempt status.    Although the Internal Revenue Service declined to comment on the Matthews andamp; Wright matter, the comptroller's investigator and others familiar with the inquiries said the IRS is investigating the Chester offering and certain other Matthews andamp; Wright underwritings. Mr. Benoit said his firm hasn't been contacted by the IRS.    The class-action suit was filed in Philadelphia by A.M. Zlotnick, who said he was a bond holder. It alleges that Commercial Bank of the Americas &quot;was controlled directly or indirectly&quot; by Arthur Abba Goldberg, executive vice president of Matthews andamp; Wright, and others. Mr. Goldberg was unavailable for comment, but Mr. Benoit termed this allegation &quot;absolutely untrue.&quot; He indicated his firm will move soon to have the suit dismissed.    A lawyer with the National Credit Union Administration, which regulates federal credit unions, said a credit union in Jersey City, N.J. -- New American Federal Credit Union -- served as the U.S. mailing address for the Saipan bank. He said Mr. Goldberg was a founder of the credit union and served for a time as its head.    Mr. Benoit said the credit union itself didn't serve as agent for the Saipan bank but that an employee of the credit union, Joel Schwartz, was its agent. Federal officials identified Mr. Schwartz as the general manager of the credit union. Mr. Schwartz was unavailable for comment.    Mr. Benoit said Matthews andamp; Wright had an account at the credit union because the firm does business with many financial institutions.    The Philadelphia Inquirer reported yesterday that Mr. Schwartz acknowleged in an interview that he had signed about 20 documents for Matthews andamp; Wright bond transactions using the title &quot;executive vice president&quot; of Commercial Bank of the Americas.    In 1986, the parent of Matthews andamp; Wright earned $11.1 million, or $2.02 a share, compared with earnings of $6.9 million, or $1.49 a share, on fewer shares outstanding in 1985. Revenue jumped to $47.2 million from $30.7 million. </TEXT></DOC>
