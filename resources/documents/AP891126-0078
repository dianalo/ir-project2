The business daily, quoting officials in the Vietnamese capitalof Hanoi, said Britain and Vietnam signed a confidential agreementabout the payments Wednesday.   ``The sum for further flights would have to be negotiatedseparately, officials in Hanoi said,'' the newspaper said.   There was no immediate from the Foreign Office in London.   The report said the first repatriations will be by air beforeChristmas, probably on a 120-seat Boeing 737 chartered by the HongKong government. The first Vietnamese to be returned probably willbe ``some of the 40,000 held in camps who may well not qualify asrefugees,'' the Financial Times said.   It said Hong Kong was considering chartering larger aircraft oreven ships to send thousands of Vietnamese boat people home.   The London newspaper said: ``Vietnamese officials added thatamong those people due to be returned were criminals `who would nowbe forced to suffer the penalty' and single women with childrenwhose prospects in Vietnam would be very limited.' They questionedwhether the act of returning such people could be consideredhumanitarian.''   There has been criticism in Britain from lawmakers, civil rightsorganizations and the news media of the government's intention torepatriate thousands of boat people on grounds they are notpolitical refugees but illegal immigrants to this crowded Britishcolony.   The United States also has been denounced for not responding toBritish appeals to take some of the refugees while criticizingBritain for the planned repatriations.   The exodus of Vietnamese began after the U.S.-backed SouthVietnamese government was defeated by communist forces from NorthVietnam in 1975, but thousands have continued to flee theirhomeland since then.</TEXT></DOC>
