But now, oddlyenough, this situation is shaping up as a potential solutionto the union's dearest goal: job security.</LP><TEXT>   UAW leaders gather today in Kansas City, Mo., to map outstrategy for this summer's national contract talks with theBig Three. And it is clear that getting more older workers toretire would help deliver the productivity gains that the BigThree auto makers seek.   It also would make it easier for the auto makers to givestronger job guarantees to the younger members who are vitalto the union's future, says Harley Shaiken, a labor expert atthe University of California at San Diego. &quot;You have an agingwork force, so the conditions of retirement are ever morecentral to the union's demands,&quot; he says.   Certainly, the union's previous attempts to guarantee jobsecurity haven't worked. The current agreement includes a banon plant closings. But it hasn't stopped General Motors Corp.and Chrysler Corp. from closing factories. The union'sefforts to develop cooperative programs with managementhaven't stopped layoffs, either. Even company officials arefrustrated.   &quot;I would hope we would find the answers&quot; to thejob-security issue in the forthcoming negotiations, says LeeA. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman. &quot;I don't have the answersyet. I hope we get some this summer.&quot;   Now, some are arguing it is time to let nature take itscourse. The demographic phenomenon overtaking the UAW isclear. The average age of UAW employees at Big Threecompanies is 45 years. More importantly, about 12% of theblue-collar labor force is over 55 years of age. Another 20%of GM's workers have 25 years of service and could leave by1995.   What is dividing the UAW's ranks is the issue of how toencourage some of its grandfathers (and grandmothers) to giveup their jobs so that younger members can hold on to theirs.   The current UAW contract requires the Big Three to hireone new worker for every two who retire. If that clause wereeliminated, GM could reduce its work force by 4% to 6% a yearwithout layoffs.   But that's not good enough for many older UAW members.About 7% of the 300,000 UAW members who work for GM have therequisite 30 years seniority to retire right now. But many ofthese workers don't want to go unless they can get biggerpensions. They form the core of a burgeoning movement amongUAW members pushing at this week's convention to makecost-of-living adjustments to pensions a top priority in theupcoming talks.   &quot;COLA on pensions is the only way you can get true jobsecurity for the younger workers,&quot; says James Hale, leader ofthe pension COLA movement. The 57-year-old Mr. Hale is anexample. He's been employed for 33 years at a GM parts plantin Flint and could retire with a full pension today -- but hewon't. &quot;I don't want to go out there on a fixed income,&quot; hesays.   Mr. Hale says he's confident he can win on a roll callvote at this week's convention. His cause gained a lot ofmomentum when GM revealed that it wants to double thepensions of 3,350 top executives, including soon-to-retireChairman Roger B. Smith.   But even if Mr. Hale scores a victory this week, the automakers will insist they can't afford fatter pensions, and theunion's top leadership agrees.   &quot;I'm not opposed to increasing pensions, but I am opposedto bankrupting the company that you've got to work for,&quot; saysGary Watson, chairman of the union's GM bargaining council.   UAW leaders argue that in the long run, they must help theBig Three compete with the growing Japanese-operatedfactories in the U.S., or risk seeing their union dwindleeven further.   Despite more than three years of layoffs and plantclosings, GM's assembly plants have nearly five workers forevery car built, 48% more than the 3.36 workers per car FordMotor Co. has, according to a recent report by consultantJames Harbour. Chrysler uses an average 4.21 workers per carper day at its assembly plants, 25% more than Ford. The U.S.operations of Japanese auto makers have a similar or greaterproductivity edge over GM and Chrysler.   Because its plants are already running at or above 100% ofnormal capacity, Ford could be in a better position to givethe UAW the kinds of job guarantees it wants than itscross-town rivals -- just as it was in 1987. Indeed, Fordexecutives are all but sending an engraved invitation to UAWleaders to select them as the target for setting the contractpattern this fall.   A hefty agreement for the UAW at Ford could be a problemfor GM. &quot;Ford could agree to some job security provisionsthat we can't. And when they would bring them to us, then wewould have a strike on our hands,&quot; one GM official worries.   But GM officials sounded similar warnings three years ago,only to discover that the job protections ratified at Fordweren't as tough as they looked.   No matter which of the Big Three the UAW ultimatelyselects to set the pattern, the union's demands for jobprotections will be countered with company proposals aimed atgetting less resistance and more work from union employees.   Top UAW leaders have backed away in recent months fromtheir once-enthusiastic line on labor-management cooperation,or &quot;jointness.&quot; This is partly a show of dismay that&quot;jointness&quot; hasn't stopped GM or Chrysler from closingfactories. But it is also aimed at blunting internalpolitical pressure from UAW dissidents who label &quot;jointness,&quot;a sellout.   In recent local elections, UAW leaders failed in theirefforts to dislodge some of their more vocal and visiblecritics in local union halls. Workers at GM's Buick Cityassembly plant in Flint, for example, recently re-elected alocal union president who pledges to go slow on cooperativeendeavors. The Flint plant is one of GM's most efficientfacilities, and the plant's flagship product, the BuickLeSabre, last year was named the highest-quality car built inAmerica by the influential consulting firm of J.D. Power andAssociates.   GM's rank and file also voted in favor of labor militantsat GM's assembly plant in Lake Orion Mich., where the companyproduces Cadillacs and Oldsmobiles, some of its mostprofitable models.   These local leaders could cause trouble for UAW presidentOwen Bieber this week and during the contract talks thisfall. But Mr. Bieber is clearly banking on support from themany local leaders who've concluded that, like it or not,they must cooperate with management to survive.   Consider what is happening at GM's Lordstown, Ohio, plant,which was so plagued by labor strife during the 1970s that itbecame a symbol of worker alienation.   After GM announced that it would stop building full-sizevans at Lordstown next year, and eliminate half the jobs atthe facility, Lordstown workers voted to let GM run the carassembly line continuously, except for a lunch break.Previously, GM had to stop the line twice a day for 23-minutemorning and afternoon breaks. The new arrangement, &quot;puts usin the forefront of consideration for any new productallocation in the future,&quot; says Lordstown union leader BillBowers.   Declares Buddy Stewart, a UAW leader from Texas: &quot;If youhad a choice, would you put a new product in a place wherethe union membership is not getting along with themanagement? Hell no] That's just good business sense.&quot;   ---                     An Aging Membership                                                                                                        Composition, by age, of the UAW's `Big Three' employees                                                                                                                     40-50                     52.6%              55 and over               11.9%                                                                                                        Source: United Auto Workers union</TEXT></DOC>
