The finalrules permitted the owner or operator of a petroleum underground storagetank to satisfy the requirements by obtaining liability insurance froma qualified insurer or risk retention group.Section 280.97 of the rules specified certain coverage terms that mustbe included in any new insurance policy or in any endorsement to an existinginsurance policy. Except for limited opportunities to supply informationregarding the parties to the contract, addresses, types of tanks, the scopeof coverage, and so forth, the insurer and insured are not allowed to varythe language of the policy or the endorsement. Language in the endorsementand certificate of insurance found in andSection; 280.97(b) require thatthe insurer attest to the fact that the language of the endorsement andcertificate of insurance is identical to the form specified in the regulations.The Agency believes that the requirement of uniform language would ensurethe availability of insurance to cover corrective action or third partydamage payments.Through meetings with insurers and segments of the regulated community,EPA has subsequently learned of the prevalence of certain interpretationsof the required language of the certificate of insurance and endorsementnot intended by EPA. EPA has received information indicating that insurersare reluctant to issue policies or to enter the underground storage tankinsurance market so long as these interpretations are not refuted by EPA.Thus EPA is today setting forth its intended interpretations of the requiredlanguage of the certificate of insurance and the endorsement as well asamending the certificate and endorsement to require that insurers use alternativelanguage that more explicitly reflects the intended meaning of these provisions.EPA is not changing the requirements that the language of all endorsementsand certificates of insurance be identical to that language found in theregulations. Instead, EPA is changing the exact nature of that mandatoryidentical language in accordance with the wishes of insurers and insureds.EPA is not soliciting comments prior to the effective date of today's rulemaking.Under section 3(b) of the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b),the Agency may for good cause or where the rule is interpretative, omitnotice and comment procedures. The Agency believes that it has good causeto omit notice and comment prior to the effective date of today's technicalamendments. First, with the exception of changes to andSection;andSection;280.97(b)(1)(d), 280.97(b)(2)(d) and 280.105(a)(2), the Agency believesthat notice and comment are unnecessary due to the non-substantive natureof the changes. These changes do not impose new substantive standards uponthe regulated community, but rather require only that insurers substitutein future endorsements and certificates of insurance language that morecarefully reflects the intended meaning of the currently required provisions.Second, the Agency believes that it is in the public interest to omit noticeand comment procedures with respect to all of the regulatory amendmentsmade today, including those to andSection;andSection; 280.97(b)(1)(d), 280.97(b)(2)(d)and 280.97(b)(2)(e), which govern termination due to non-payment of premium.The Agency has received information to the effect that these amendmentsmay increase the availability of insurance policies to owners and operatorsof 100-999 tanks required to comply with the financial responsibility ruleby October 26, 1989, as required by 40 CFR 280.91(b). At the same time,the Agency has received information that greater availability of insurancemay ease the burden of compliance with the financial responsibility requirementsamong those owners and operators subject to the October 26, 1989, deadline.Finally, the information referred to was received too late to prepare andpublish regulatory changes in response to this information before today.Thus the Agency has concluded that, due to the delays involved in suchprocedures, providing notice and comment on these amendments is contraryto the public interest. The delays consequent to soliciting and respondingto public comments are likely to prevent these amendments from becomingeffective in time for insurers entering the underground storage tank insurancemarket because of these amendments to prepare policies and for owners andoperators to obtain these new policies by the October 26, 1989, deadline.However, the Agency is soliciting comment on today's regulatory amendments.Comments may be submitted on or before December 11, 1989. Comments willbe considered by the Agency and, if necessary, the Agency will issue afinal rule changing today's amendments to respond to these comments.The amendments to 40 CFR part 280 contained in today's rulemaking and effectivetoday apply only to those insurance policies, endorsements and certificatesof insurance that are issued or renewed after today's date. Thus policies,endorsements and certificates of insurance that were issued prior to today'sdate and in compliance with 40 CFR part 280 as written prior to today'srule will continue to be valid until such time as they are cancelled orterminated, or must be renewed.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Authority</ITAG>These regulations are issued under the authority of sections 2002, 9001,9002, 9003, 9004, 9005, 9006, 9007, and 9009 of the Solid Waste DisposalAct, as amended. The principal amendments to this Act have been under theResource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, the Hazardous and SolidWaste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-616) and the Superfund Amendmentsand Reauthorization Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-499) (42 U.S.C. 6921, 6991,6991(a), 6991(b) 6991(c), 6991(d), 6991(e), 6991(f), and 6991(h)).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>A. Six-month Extended Reporting Requirement for Claims-Made PoliciesMandatory language in the endorsement and certificate of insurance requiresthat a claims-made insurance contract cover claims for any occurrence thatcommenced during the term of the policy and that is discovered and reportedto the insurer within six months of the effective date of the cancellationor other termination of the policy. The language of 40 CFR 280.97(b), Endorsementparagraph 2.e; andSection; 280.97(b), Certification paragraph 2.e. reads:``The insurance covers claims for any occurrence that commenced duringthe term of the policy that is discovered and reported to the [`Insurer'or `Group'] within six months of the effective date of the cancellationor termination of the policy.]'' This provision was meant to address concernsthat a claims-made policy might leave a gap in coverage, if, for example,a claim is reported after the expiration of a policy for a release thatbegan prior to the policy expiration date. Such claims might not be coveredby the usual claims-made policy that is issued in the insurance industry.This is discussed in the preamble to the October 26, 1988, final rule.53 FR 43350-51.Through discussions with representatives of the insurance industry, however,EPA has learned that the industry generally interprets EPA's extended reportingperiod provision to require that every claims-made policy issued, regardlessof what retroactive date is incorporated, contain an extended reportingperiod. Because charging a fee for the extended reporting period is a widespreadpractice within the industry, this interpretation has caused insurancecompanies to routinely request payment for the extended reporting periodat the start of the policy period. Due to a reluctance on the part of insuredsto pay for this coverage at the beginning of a policy period when theyexpect to renew their policy or otherwise purchase a new policy with thesame retroactive date as their prior policy, this interpretation is apparentlyimpinging upon the availability of UST insurance.As explained below, however, this prevalent interpretation of the extendedreporting period is not intended by the Agency, and is in fact unnecessaryto the protection of human health and the environment. EPA intends thatinsurers provide extended reporting period coverage only where the terminationor non-renewal of the policy results in the owner or operator having nocoverage for releases that occurred during the time period of the previouspolicy and which are reported within six months after the termination ornon-renewal of that policy. For discussion purposes, EPA has labelled thispredicament as a ``gap'' in coverage. Because a ``gap'' in coverage willnot always exist at the termination or other non-renewal of every insurancepolicy, interpreting the EPA regulation to require every insurance policyto have an extended reporting period results in the provision of unnecessarycoverage and, considering the industry's standard fee practice, an unnecessaryrestraint upon the availability of UST insurance. For instance, a ``gap''in coverage will not normally occur where an existing policy is renewed.According to standard insurance industry practice, a renewed policy incorporatesthe retroactive date of the previous policy. Thus should the insured whorenews his policy report a release that occurred during the time periodof the previous policy, the release would be covered by the renewed policy.It may also be true that no ``gap'' will exist even when the insured purchasesa new policy from a different insurance company. Many companies will incorporatethe retroactive date of the insured's previous policy (as well as the sametype of insurance coverage as provided by the previous policy) for releasesthat are reported during the time period of the new policy but which occurredduring the time of the previous policy. Here, as in the case of renewedpolicies, the requirement to obtain an extended reporting period at theend of the first policy period would not be of any benefit to human healthand the environment since the new policy provides the same coverage asthat provided by the extended reporting period.EPA believes that there are only two situations where the termination ofa policy results in a ``gap'' in coverage and thus only two situationswhere the insured whose policy is terminated must obtain extended reportingperiod coverage. The first situation occurs where the insured renews hisexisting policy or purchases a new policy and the renewed or new policycontains a retroactive date subsequent to the retroactive date of the insured'sprevious insurance policy. The second situation occurs where the policyis terminated or is otherwise not renewed and the insured elects a financialassurance mechanism other than insurance (such as a guarantee, surety bond,etc.) as a replacement. EPA is today promulgating revised language to clarifyEPA's intended interpretation of paragraph 2.e. of the Endorsement containedin andSection; 280.97(b)(1) and of paragraph 2.e. of the Certification containedin andSection; 280.97(b)(2).In addition, EPA is also revising the language of these two paragraphsto state explicitly what it had previously believed to be self-evident:that claims reported to the insurer during the six-month reporting periodare subject to all of the terms, limits and conditions that existed duringthe policy period that it modifies. Because the Agency has received questionson this matter since promulgating the October 26, 1988, rule, the Agencydecided to add clarifying language on this point in addition to the moreimportant changes to andSection; 280.97(b) described above.The language of paragraph 2.e. of the Endorsement and Certification inandSection; 280.97(b) now reads:<ITAG tagnum="21">The insurance covers claims otherwise covered by the policy that arereported to the [``Insurer'' or ``Group''] within six months of the effectivedate of cancellation or non-renewal of the policy except where the newor renewed policy has the same retroactive date or a retroactive date earlierthan that of the prior policy, and which arise out of any covered occurrencethat commenced after the policy retroactive date, if applicable, and priorto such policy renewal or termination date. Claims reported during suchextended reporting period are subject to the terms, conditions, limits,including limits of liability, and exclusions of the policy.</ITAG>Because EPA expects that these regulatory changes will result in ownersand operators purchasing extended reporting period coverage, where needed,at the end, rather than the beginning of their policy period, EPA wishesto clarify exactly when such coverage must be obtained for compliance purposes.Where extended reporting period coverage is necessary, such coverage mustbe obtained before the time and date of the expiration of the prior policy.A related issue raised by insurers concerns the possibility of double coveragethrough an expansive interpretation of what constitutes ``termination''of the claims-made policy under andSection; 280.97(b)(1) Endorsement paragraph(e), and andSection; 280.97(b)(2) Certification paragraph (e),_the act thattriggers the six-month extended reporting requirement discussed above.For example, under some state insurance laws, the mere addition or deletionof retail outlets from a company's insurance policy may constitute a ``termination''of the policy. Such a change would not constitute a ``termination'' underEPA's interpretation of that term. EPA interprets ``termination'' to encompassonly those changes that could result in a gap in coverage as where theinsured has not obtained substitute coverage or has obtained substitutecoverage with a different retroactive date than the retroactive date ofthe original policy.Finally, the Agency wishes to clarify its position with respect to thecurrent insurance industry practice of charging insureds for the six monthextended reporting period. EPA's regulations require that owners and operatorsobtain a six-month extended reporting period whenever a gap in their insurancecoverage may exist. EPA's regulations go to owners and operators and notto those providing the insurance required under the rules. Therefore, whetherinsurers choose to provide the extended reporting period to insureds onlyfor an additional cost is of no concern to the Agency with respect to compliancewith the financial responsibility requirements. Insurers are free to providethe extended reporting period only for an additional cost; however, insuredswho fail to obtain such coverage due to non-payment of this added costwill be out of compliance with EPA's financial responsibility requirements.B. Sixty Days Required Coverage Following Cancellation or Termination byInsurerMandatory language in the endorsement and certificate of insurance requiresthat cancellation or any other termination of the insurance by the insurerwill be effective only upon written notice and only after expiration of60 days after written notice is received by the insured. 40 CFR 280.97(b)(1)Endorsement paragraph d. and 280.97(b)(2) Certification paragraph d. Aseparate provision of the regulations restates this requirement for cancellationof insurance. 40 CFR 280.105(a)(2). Additionally, the insurer must providea six-month extended reporting period following cancellation. These provisionswere meant to ensure that an owner or operator whose insurance was cancelledor terminated would have sufficient time to obtain an alternative assurancemechanism, thereby avoiding any unacceptable gaps in coverage. These provisionsdid not distinguish between the effective date of cancellation where thecancellation was due to non-payment of premium or misrepresentation asopposed to cancellation for any other cause.Subsequent discussions with insurers and segments of the regulated communitythat are seeking insurance have persuaded the Agency that the provisionfor extended coverage for sixty days following cancellation of coveragefor non-payment of premium or misrepresentation is reducing the availabilityof insurance. The Agency has received indications that some insurers havedecided against entering the market because of concerns that they mightbe forced to pay claims without ever having received any premiums or wherethe insured has made a misrepresentation. The Agency has also been informedthat other insurers have increased premiums to protect against situationsin which the insurer would have to pay for losses for which it has nevercollected a premium.EPA is today amending the language of andSection; 280.97(b)(1) Endorsementparagraph d, andSection; 280.97(b)(2) Certification paragraph d and andSection;280.105(a)(2) to allow an insurer to terminate an insurance contract fornon-payment of premium or misrepresentation by the insured after a 10 daynotice period. EPA does not intend for this shortening of the coverageperiod from 60 to 10 days to apply to termination for any reason otherthan non-payment of premium or misrepresentation. The Agency is aware thatsome state insurance laws mandate a longer notice period following cancellation.In order to accommodate these state-specific situations, the amended languageof andSection; 280.97(b)(1) Endorsement paragraph d, andSection; 280.97(b)(2)Certification paragraph d and andSection; 280.105(a)(2) specifies that themandatory coverage period following termination for non-payment of premiumor misrepresentation shall be a ``minimum of 10 days.'' The insurer isstill bound to provide the owner or operator with written notice of cancellationwith the 10 day period beginning upon receipt of notice by the owner oroperator.When the final rule was promulgated, the Agency believed that a 60-daycancellation coverage period was necessary to allow the insured owner oroperator to obtain an alternative assurance mechanism, and thus avoid anyunacceptable gap in coverage. The Agency thought that this requirementwould not have a serious impact on insurance providers since insurers couldprotect themselves by establishing an appropriate schedule of premium payment.For example, insurers could require payment 90 days before the expirationdate of coverage for maintenance or renewal of the policy. The insurercould then terminate the policy with 60 days notice if an insured doesnot meet the schedule of payment within 30 days of the premium due date.Subsequently, the Agency has come to a better understanding of the economicimpact on insurers of not allowing more than a 10-day cancellation periodfor non-payment of premium or misrepresentation. Insurers currently coveringUSTs have found restructuring premium payment schedules to be costly andimpractical, primarily because the practice is a major departure from existingindustry practices. An important consequence of the 60-day cancellationrequirement for non-payment of premium or misrepresentation has been thedeterrence of new insurers from entering the UST market.Although the Agency continues to be concerned about the adequacy of the10-day cancellation in terms of finding alternative financial assuranceafter cancellation for non-payment, EPA does not want this requirementto have an impact on the availability and affordability of UST insurance.The Agency believes that today's amendment will bring the financial responsibilityrequirements into greater conformity with insurance industry practicesconcerning cancellation and thus avoid possible impacts upon the availabilityand affordability of such insurance. Generally, EPA believes that the insuranceindustry should be paid for bearing the risks of corrective action andthird-party liability costs. In the cases of non-payment, the industryis unfairly undertaking risks without rightful compensation. For thoseinsurers resisting entry into the market, the threat of insuring riskswithout ever receiving any premium is apparently a serious concern. Thus,today's change should remove a serious obstacle to the supply of insuranceto owners and operators of underground storage tanks.The Agency is not amending the requirement for a six-month extended reportingperiod following cancellation for non-payment of premium or misrepresentation.As noted in the previous section, the Agency believes that such a reportingperiod must be mandatory for all claims-made insurance contracts used todemonstrate financial assurance, regardless of the reason for termination.The six-month extended reporting period is essential to avoiding gaps incoverage that could threaten human health and environment, especially incases where the owner or operator may have as few as 10 days upon receiptof notice of cancellation to obtain substitute coverage. The distinctionbetween the two provisions, extended reporting period and the effectivedate of cancellation, is that even if a policy is cancelled for non-paymentof premium, the extended reporting period merely extends the time duringwhich an insured may report occurrences covered by the policy for whichhe or she has already paid. Thus the extended reporting provision doesnot provide the insured with a benefit for which he or she has not paid.In contrast, any delay in the effective date of a policy cancellation ortermination due to regulatory requirements provides insureds who failedto pay their premiums coverage for which they have not paid.C. Other Regulatory ChangesToday's action makes three other regulatory changes in the requirementsfor the language in the endorsement and certificate of insurance. As notedabove, EPA is not changing the requirement that the language of all endorsementsand certificates of insurance be identical to that language found in theregulations. Instead, EPA is changing the mandatory language itself tomeet the needs of insurers and insureds.While insurance policies issued in connection with the financial responsibilityrequirements must be amended by attaching the endorsement or evidencedby the certificate of insurance, the endorsement and certificate do notstand apart from the insurance policy. Some insurers were concerned thatthe existing mandatory language did not allow the parties to make the relationshipbetween the scope of the policy and the requirements of the certificateand endorsement clear. The first two technical amendments made today areintended to make that connection.First, the phrase ``in accordance with the subject to the limits of liability,exclusions, conditions, and other terms, of the policy'' is being addedto the first paragraph of both the endorsement and certification afterthe explanation of what the endorsement and certificate provide to clarifythat these instruments do not narrow or broaden the scope of coverage providedin the policy itself. This correction also brings the required regulatorylanguage into conformity with standard UST insurance industry practices.The amendment should reduce any confusion on the part of insureds concerningthe coverage they are purchasing and also minimize insurers' concerns aboutpotential conflicts with insureds over the scope of coverage. The secondphrase, ``which are subject to a separate limit under the policy,'' isinserted in the language of the certificate and endorsement to modify thephrase ``exclusive of legal defense costs'' in paragraph 1 of the endorsementand certification where the limits of liability found in the policy arediscussed. While the language of the endorsement and the certificationprevent the insurer from describing any existing limits upon legal defensecosts, EPA did not intend to indicate that such limitations are not allowableor that such limitations that may be present in the policy are not valid.The Agency does not want the mandatory language concerning legal defensecosts to inerfere with the parties' understanding of the policy itself.Third, the phrase ``after the policy retroactive date'' is being addedto specify the beginning of the period when occurrences are covered underthe policy. It is common for insurers to establish such a date in a policyand use that date to determine when to divide coverage between policieswhen a second policy is coming into effect. Each of the above phrases beingadded conform to standard UST insurance industry usage and are not intendedto change the requirements for the certificate and endorsement. These technicalchanges are effective immediately.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 280</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Environmental protection, Hazardousmaterials insurance, Surety bonds, Underground storage tanks.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan Z.
