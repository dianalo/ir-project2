After allowing accumulation of /sup 125/Idecay-induced damage to the DNA, application of DNA sequencing techniquesenables positions of strand breaks to be located relative to the siteof decay, at a resolution corresponding to the distance between adjacentnucleotides [0.34 nm]. Thus, DNA provides a molecular framework to analysethe extent of damage following [averaged] individual decay events. Resultscan be compared with energy deposition data generated by computer-simulationmethods developed by Charlton et al. The DNA sequencing technique alsoprovides information about the chemical nature of the termini of theDNA chains produced following Auger decay-induced damage. In additionto reviewing the application of this approach to the analysis of /sup125/I decay induced DNA damage, some more recent results obtained byusing /sup 67/Ga are also presented.</TEXT></DOC>
