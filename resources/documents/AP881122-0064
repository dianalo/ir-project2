Riot police firing tear gas and wielding batons halted the fight,started by southerners who are mainly Christians and animists.   Reporters watched as about 500 southerners started stoning 1,500members of the National Islamic Front marching through the center ofthe capital, Khartoum.   The procession was heading for the Sudanese armed forcesheadquarters to lodge a protest with Defense Minister Abdul-MeguidKhalil.   After the clash, heavily armed soldiers blocked the way to theheadquarters and the marchers diverted to the Cabinet building.There, Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, the front's deputy secretary-general,read out a protest that was to be presented to the government.   It described the agreement as an act of ``treason to the Sudanesepeople and to the armed forces.''   The Moslem fundamentalists have been protesting a tentative peaceagreement signed last Wednesday between John Garang, leader of thesouthern rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army and Mohamad Osmanal-Mirghani, head of the Democratic Unionist Party, a junior partnerin Sudan's coalition government.   They strongly object to a condition calling for the suspension ofharsh Islamic laws that in Sudan also are applied to the minorityChristians and animists who make up the majority of southerners.   ``No, no to the traitors, no to peace without Islam,'' chantedthe fundamentalists.   Southerners attacked them with stones, injuring two men on thehead among others who were hospitalized. It was not clear whetherany southerners were wounded.   The attackers live in shantytowns and slums in and aroundKhartoum and are among the 2 million southerners who have fled thecivil war for safer northern havens.   Southern rebels took up arms in 1983 against the Moslem-dominatedgovernment in the north, demanding economic and social reforms.</TEXT></DOC>
