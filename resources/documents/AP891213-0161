Aryeh Eliav, a member of Parliament from the center-left LaborParty, made the comment after returning from a meeting in Cairowith officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Theofficials included Nabil Shaat, a top political aide to PLO chiefYasser Arafat.   Eliav said the intensive efforts in Cairo are aimed atsubmitting Palestinian names for Israeli approval in Washingtonnext month as a step toward the first direct formal negotiationsbetween Israelis and Palestinians.   The Labor legislator is the first Israeli official to confirm areport by the daily Yediot Ahronot on Sunday sayingbehind-the-scenes peace contacts were under way, despite Israel'sinsistence that the PLO be excluded from the process. Israelconsiders the PLO a terrorist group and officially refuses to holdtalks with its members.   Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, hasdenied Sunday's newspaper report. He also said Israeli CabinetSecretary Eliakim Rubinstein would go to Washington this week toseek written U.S. guarantees that the PLO be excluded from peaceefforts.   However, Eliav said Egypt and the PLO were already at workdrawing up lists of names to present to the Israeli and Egyptianforeign ministers when they meet in January with U.S. Secretary ofState James A. Baker III.   The Washington meeting called by Baker, for which no definitedate has been set, is supposed to set the stage forIsraeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo about an Israeli proposal tohold elections in the occupied territories.   ``There are some very, very intensive efforts under way in Cairoinvolving Egypt, the Americans _ as advisers _ and the PLO, tocomprise a delegation that Israel can accept,'' Eliav said in atelephone interview.   Israel's denial of even indirect talks with the PLO is false,Eliav added. ``Whoever thinks they are not partners, that they arenot involved in the process, is living in a fool's paradise, likeAlice in Wonderland,'' he said.   Eliav said he met Shaat and the PLO ambassador in Cairo, SaidKamal, during a two-day symposium on the Israeli-Palestiniandispute sponsored by the Egyptian newspaper El Ahram.   The PLO was ready to ``be flexible'' about Israeli demands,Eliav said.   ``I have the impression they understand they cannot allowthemselves the luxury of selecting only the people they want, andthat they are putting together a list Israel will find difficult tooppose. People in the PLO know they must not miss this boat,''Eliav added.   He refused to provide names of prospective Palestiniannegotiators.   The Israeli peace plan, introduced in April, calls for the 1.7million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip toelect representatives to negotiate interim self-rule. The finalstatus of the territories would be negotiated later.   The PLO has balked at accepting the plan because it does notguarantee the Palestinians independent statehood.   Eliav declined to elaborate on his talks with PLO officials amidradio reports he could be questioned on suspicion of violating alaw that bars Israelis from meeting with PLO members. The lawmakersaid he had stayed within the bounds of the 1986 anti-terrorist lawbecause the meetings were held during a public conference.</TEXT></DOC>
