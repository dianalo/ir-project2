Cuomo played the role of emcee, meeting with Jackson andDukakis, speaking nicely of them as well as Gore, but not endorsinganyone.   Some divined a preference for Dukakis; when Cuomo urged partyleaders to express a preference for a candidate, many of themflocked to the Massachusetts governor's side.   But there was confusion aplenty when the governor and his aidesoffered multiple explanations of whether he would accept a draft atthe party nomination convention. Asked if he would utter a simpleyes or no answer to the question, he replied, ``Yes or no.''   Koch provided much of the fireworks, first saying that Jewswould have to be ``crazy'' to vote for Jackson, then saying thatthe former civil rights leader ``under stress is not capable oftelling the truth.''   Gore, who ardently sought Koch's backing in hopes of cuttinginto Dukakis' support among Jews and other residents of New YorkCity, declared by the end of the campaign that the mayor was``speaking for himself.''   Jackson's campaign manager, Gerald Austin, returned fire. Koch,he said, ``is a lunatic.''   Dukakis wanted none of that fight, but he had trials of his own.   He was upbraided at one campaign stop in Harlem for not doingmore to contest Jackson for black votes, and spent several hoursducking reporters one day who wanted to ask him about the Reaganadministration's decision to bomb Iranian oil platforms in thePersian Gulf.   He was thrown off-stride briefly when he refused to rule outcreation of a Palestinian state, and again when Gore pounced upon aremark concerning the possible use of nuclear weapons in the eventof a Soviet invasion of Europe.   Bush watched from a distance. He divided time between nextweek's primary state of Pennsylvania and Washington, where heattended official meetings on the Iranian military situation.   ``I can't wait for the debates with the Democratic nominee nomatter who it turns out to be,'' he said.   ``Even if they unleash Mario Cuomo, I can't wait.''</TEXT></DOC>
