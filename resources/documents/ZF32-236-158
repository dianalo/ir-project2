(tips for using the Microsoft Windows graphicalinterface)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Hall, William S.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>CREATE YOUR OWN ICONSandM;In the September 11, 1990, article &quot;Windows 3.0 Under the Spotlight,&quot; yousaid the Windows accessory Paintbrush can be used to &quot;design or modifyicons.&quot; Could you tell me how to make these custom modifications? I can'tfind any information in the Windows manual.andM;Lawrence C. WingerandM;Falmouth, Maine,andM;Unfortunately, this statement is not quite true: while you can use Paintbrushto create the images, you can't save them as icon files.andP;  However, Len Grayof Impact Software offers a solution with his shareware program, PBICON.andO;Simply create your image in Paintbrush and then paste it into PBICON, whereyou can save the result as an icon file.andM;The size of the image doesn't matter: Draw it to scale as a 32- by 32-pixelrectangle or design a larger image, which PBICON can then shrink to icon sizeduring the paste.andP;  You should note that 32 by 32 is a square set of pixels,but the icon may not appear square on your machine.andP;  The shape depends on theaspect ratio of your display.andP;  On a VGA (1:1) and EGA (4:3),32 by 32 doeslook like a square; but on a CGA or 8514/A, the natural icon size is 32 by 16and 64 by 64, respectively.andP;  So a 32-by-32 icon looks funny on thesedisplays.andP;  Moreover, the icons you can develop have 16 colors.andP;  Thus, againthey are most useful on EGA and VGA displays.andM;Once you've created an .ICO file, you can use it in the Program Manager torepresent a file.andP;  Pull up the group where you want to put the icon and makesure the icon to be replaced is highlighted.andP;  Select the Properties commandon the Program Manager's File menu to bring up the Program Item Propertiesdialog box.andP;  Click on Change Icon, and in the File Name box, type in the fullpath and filename of the new icon.andP;  Click OK, then click OK again, andWindows will display the new icon in the program group you selected.andM;Until the advent of Windows 3.0, only Windows programmers were interested increating icons.andP;  Things have changed--now everyone wants to get into theact--but most of the good tools are only parts of Windows development utilitypackages.andP;  The Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) offers SDKPaint, whichyou can use to create icons, cursors, and small bitmaps.andP;  EdenSoft (Berkeley,California, 415-548-3554) offers a package called Resource Workshop, whichalso contains a tool for creating icons.andM;If you want to make icons primarily for VGA and EGA displays, try ICONDRAW, ashareware program created by Philip B. Eskelin.andP;  ICONDRAW allows you tocreate 32 by 32 pixel icons in 16 colors.andP;  Unlike PBICON, this program doesnot need Paintbrush; simply draw the image and save it to a file.andP;  Installthe icon using the procedure described above.andM;If you don't want to draw icons yourself, download collections of them fromPC MagNet and CompuServe.andP;  There, you'll also find bitmaps that you can usefor wallpaper.andM;If you want to manage your icons by placing them in one or more libraries,try James M. Curran's ICONDLL, which is available on CompuServe.andP;  You'll needthe Microsoft Resource Compiler (which comes with the Windows SDK) to carryout part of the process.andP;  In the current directory, ICONDLL creates atemporary .RC file listing all icons found there.andP;  It then runs the RCcompiler to combine them into a single file that the Program Manager canread.andP;  In this way, you can use the View Next button when you are in the AddIcon dialog box to page through the selections.andP;  It's more convenient to haveall icons stored in one place, and you can save some disk space as well.andM;You can download PBICON and collections of icons and bitmaps from the PCMagNet UTILFORUM.andP;  ICONDRAW is available from UTILFORUM, LIB 10.andM;WHEREVER THE DATA ISandM;If a Windows program is in your path, you can run the program andautomatically make any directory current.andP;  You simply use the File Propertiesmenu to indicate that the program is located in the directory you want, evenwhen it isn't.andM;Suppose you want to run Word for Windows, and WINWORD.EXE resides inC:\WINDOWS\WINWORD (which is in your path).andP;  If you want to change thedirectory to D:\WFW\DATA when you click on WINWORD's icon, follow threesteps:andM;First, create a new program item: pull up one of your Program Groups, selectFile, New, and press Enter to accept the Program Item default.andP;  Then enterandM;D:\WFW\DATA\WINWORD.EXEandM;in the Command box and type in an appropriate description.andM;Next, replace your WINWORD icon with the new one: Click on Change Icon (orpress Alt-l), type WINWORD.EXE as the filename (it's on the path, so Windowswill find it when you run the program), and hit Enter.andP;  Note: if you skipthis step, you'll get a default icon, because WINWORD.EXE is not actually inD:\WFW\DATA.andM;After you hit Enter, Windows will generate the error message &quot;The specifiedpath is invalid.&quot; Ignore the message, click on OK (or press Tab/Enter), andthe group will immediately display your new icon.andP;  You get the uninformativemessage because the path you just entered cannot be found in your PATHenvironment variable.andP;  But if you execute WINWORD from this icon, you'll findyourself in D:\WFW\DATA.andM;What if you don't have (or don't want) Word for Windows in the path? You canstill trick the Program Manager into loading a specific file from a specificdirectory, no matter where WINWORD.EXE is located.andP;  In order to do this, youmust make sure that the program is associated with the specific kind of fileyou want.andP;  You can change or create extension associations by editing theandlsqb;extensions] section of WIN.INI or by using the Associate command in the Filemenu of the File Manager.andP;  (Just click on a data file of the type you want toassociate; pull down the file menu and select Associate; then fill in thefull pathname of the executable in the dialog box.)andM;Suppose the WINWORD file you want to edit is TODO.DOC.andM;First, you must associate the DOC extension with the full pathname ofWINWORD.EXE.andP;  If you decide to modify WIN.INI, insert the following statementandM;DOC=C: \WINDOWS\WINWORD\WINWORD.EXEandM;^.DOCandM;into the [extensions] section.andM;Next, create a new program item in the appropriate group.andP;  Bring up thegroup, pull down the Program Manager's File menu, select New, and Enter.andO;Type in a description (such as To Do List) and use D:\WFW\DATA\TODO.DOC asthe command.andM;Press Alt-I to change the icon.andP;  This time, type in the full path andfilename of WINWORD.EXE and hit Enter.andP;  Windows will display &quot;The specifiedpath is invalid.&quot; Just as before, ignore the message and click on OK (orpress Tab/Enter).andP;  When you run the newly created program item, Windows willchange the path to D:\WFW\DATA and &quot;run&quot; TODO.DOC.andP;  DOC is now associatedwith C:\WINDOWS\WINWORD\WINWORD.EXE, so WINWORD will execute and openTODO.DOC.andP;  This technique is especially useful for creating Program Groups ofrelated documents.andM;Guy J. GalloandM;New York, New YorkandM;The approach is indeed useful--especially if you have a file that you editfrequently.andP;  It also exploits Windows' ability (albeit limited) to associatedata with a program.andP;  It's too bad, however, that we have to work so hard toget the right icon.andM;There are two other situations where this is useful.andP;  If your path containsthe program and you enter only the program's name (such as WINWORD.EXE) inthe Command Line of the Program Properties Dialog Box, then the program willstart in your Windows directory.andP;  On the other hand, if you specify the fullpathname of the executable  C:\WINDOWS\WINWORD\WINWORD.EXE), thats where youwill start--in the path C:\WINDOWS\WINWORD.andP;  It does not matter whether theprogram is in the path or not.andM;MISSING PRINTSCREENandM;I have a PS/2 Model 60 with an IBM Proprinter II attached.andP;  Before Iinstalled Windows 3.0, I used to make use of Shift-PrintScreen.andP;  I would, forexample, use DIR /P and run the PrintScreen command each time a new pageappeared.andP;  This way I could print listings of subdirectories or diskettefiles.andP;  Unfortunately, since I installed the latest version of Windows,nothing seems to happen when I issue the PrintScreen command.andP;  Any ideas?andM;Vicki PowellandM;Columbus, OhioandM;I  assume you mean that you can't print the screen in your usual way from aDOS command shell that you've executed from Windows 3.0.andP;  If you are runningWindows in real or standard mode (as you must on the Model 60), thenPrintScreen or any of its variations (Shift-PrintScreen, Ctrl-PrintScreen,and so on) simply copies the contents of a text screen to the WindowsClipboard.andP;  You cannot use it as before to send the screen contents directlyto the printer.andP;  But, if you return to Windows after each page (usingAlt-Tab), you can save the screen you just captured to a file via theClipboard's file menu.andP;  Or, paste the information into a program like Notepador Write.andP;  From there, send it to the printer.andP;  Note that in real or standardmode, you can't transfer a graphics image to the Clipboard.andM;Unfortunately, it would be a rather tiresome process to make a long directorylisting using the DIR /P command.andP;  For each page displayed, you would have toprint the screen to the Clipboard, return to Windows, use Paste in, say,Notepad (so you can later append the information you've just captured), andthen return back to the DOS shell for the next part of the listing.andP;  It ismuch more efficient to simply type DIR andgt; PRN.andP;  In this way, you can bypassthe return to Windows and send the list directly to the printer.andM;By the way, I should mention that if you use this method with a page printersuch as an HP LaserJet, you will need to flush the output by sending aform-feed (Ctrl-L) to the printer.andP;  I have a short FLUSH.BAT batch fileandM;echo ^L andgt; prnandM;that will do it.andP;  To create the file, use a text editor to insert controlcharacters into the text.andP;  Or just use the tried-and-true methodandM;copy con flush.batandM;echo ^L andgt; prnandM;^zandM;If you add the print command to FLUSH.BAT, you can't print several directorylistings at once.andP;  You can also use FLUSH.BAT for other printing tasks.andM;In Windows 'enhanced mode, the situation is rather different.andP;  Now thePrintScreen key has its usual meanings, as long as you are running fullscreen.andP;  Shift-PrintScreen prints the screen and Ctrl-PrintScreen sendsoutput to both the screen and the printer until another CtrlPrintScreen ishit.andP;  In addition, PrtScr or Alt-PrintScreen will copy the contents of thescreen to the Clipboard; you can then paste the result to some otherapplication.andM;In enhanced mode, you can even use this technique to capture a graphicsimage.andP;  Suppose we run BASIC in a DOS shell.andP;  To get into graphics mode typeandM;SCREEN 2,0,0,0andM;then draw a circle with the commandandM;CIRCLE (200,100),100andM;Now type Alt-PrintScreen to capture the image, return to Windows withAlt-Tab, and run Paintbrush.andP;  Using the edit command, paste the image intothe window.andM;To discover how to avoid cropping the picture to the visible window area,read the next letter.andM;MORE ABOUT PRINTSCREENandM;In Windows you can use Alt-PrintScreen to capture a given window; withPrintScreen you can take a snapshot of the entire desktop.andP;  But if the imageis too large, Paintbrush crops it to the visible window.andP;  I have tried usingthe View command to eliminate the Tools and the Palette, and I have zoomedPaintbrush to its maximum size: both in vain--I still lose part of thepicture.andP;  Is there any solution?andM;Katherine ZvonekandM;Abilene, TexasandM;The following procedure can help you.andP;  First, copy the screen to theClipboard using PrintScreen.andP;  Next run Paintbrush from the Accessories Groupby double-clicking on the Paintbrush icon or using the File menu Run command(Alt-F, R).andP;  From the Paintbrush Options menu, choose Image Attributes,select Default and click on OK.andP;  From the file menu choose New.andP;  From theView menu select Zoom Out.andP;  Now using the Edit menu, select Paste.andP;  If theimage does not appear, perform this last step a second time.andP;  Finally, usingthe View menu, select Zoom In.andM;To ensure you made the proper capture, use the View menu to View Picture.andO;The image will now appear full-screen.andP;  A click of the mouse or a tap of theEsc key will bring you back to normal view.andM;OPENING WINDOWSandM;Share your experiences with the Windows environment.andP;  We'll pay $50 for anytips we print.andP;
