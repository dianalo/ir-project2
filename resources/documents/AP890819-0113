The two officers, who are accused of robbing a drug dealer, weresuspended Friday after reporters sought comment from Sheriff JamesO'Grady for an article on the alleged corruption published in earlySunday edition of the Chicago Tribune.   The report said sheriff's officers have concealed evidence,thwarted efforts to interview witnesses and hidden their ownrelationships with suspects and victims in murder investigationsdating back 15 years.   Telephone calls from The Associated Press to the sheriff'sdepartment for comment on the Tribune's report went unansweredSaturday.   On Friday, Sheriff's Police Lt. William H. Martin, 55, a 22-yearveteran of the department, was suspended for his allegedparticipation in the 1986 robbery of a suburban drug dealer.   Deputy Larry Geanes, 39, a six-year employee of the CourtServices department, also was suspended for alleged involvement inthe scheme.   O'Grady will press the county State's Attorney's office to filecriminal charges against the men and will go before a merit board toseek their dismissal, spokesman William Currie said Saturday.   A telephone call to a residence with the listing of L. Geanes insouth suburban Calumet City went unanswered Saturday. At the Martinresidence, a man who identified himself as William Martin's fathersaid the officer was not available for comment.   The sheriff's department, with headquarters in Chicago, runs thecounty jail and has a 500-member police force to cover the 177square miles of unicorporated Cook County and forest preserve land.   According to the Tribune, no one has been convicted of anorganized crime murder in Cook County in more than two decades. Thesheriff's department has run the investigations of most of theestimated 70 organized crime murders in the Chicago area in the last25 years.   The case in which the two men have been suspended began tounravel Feb. 2, 1987, after Dwayne Henderson, a street-level drugdealer and police informant, was shot twice in the head. His bodywas dumped in an isolated area.   For 1{ years, high-ranking sheriff's officials preventedinvestigators from aggressively pursuing the case, the paper said,quoting unidentified sources. The allegations include accusationsthat Henderson, along with sheriff's officers and jail guards, setup a robbery and extortion ring that preyed on suburban drugdealers, the newspaper said.   Rather than expose allegations that fellow officers and jailguards were suspects in the case, high-ranking sheriff's officershid evidence and sanitized files, the Tribune said, citinginterviews and department records.   O'Grady, elected sheriff in 1986, said he first heard of thecover-up allegations in the middle of 1988. By O'Grady's account,some high-ranking officers gave investigators the impression theyshould ``tread slowly'' in efforts to solve the murder.   ``I was so concerned about the investigation that I let the FBIknow about it,'' O'Grady said. ``I wasn't happy about the case then,and I'm still not happy about the case's status.''   The newspaper quoted an unidentified drug dealer as saying thatfour or five men who identified themselves as sheriff's policeswarmed around him one night and took his money and drugs.   Many of the cover-ups alleged in the article took place duringthe administration of Richard Elrod, county sheriff from 1970through 1986. Elrod, who had little to do with day-to-dayoperations, told the newspaper he knew nothing of the corruptionalleged in the article.   ``I had no inkling,'' said Elrod, now a Cook County Circuit Courtjudge.</TEXT></DOC>
