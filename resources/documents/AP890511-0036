And the panel's chairman, Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., gave astrong vote of confidence to special outside counsel RichardPhelan, the Chicago lawyer who conducted the long probe that so farhas produced 69 charges that Wright violated House rules.   Attacks on Phelan's professionalism by Wright's lawyers are``totally inaccurate, totally wrong and an exercise in badjudgment,'' Dixon said, adding that he has ``total confidence inhim.''   At the same time, the Justice Department expressed renewedinterest in the Wright matter and in particular his connection withallegedly illegal campaign contributions made in 1985 for a specialTexas House election.   The ethics panel met for 2{ hours on Wednesday and voted to makeavailable to Wright's lawyers some witnesses and documents thathave figured in its 11-month investigation of the Texas Democrat.   But the panel denied Wright's motion to bar Phelan from havingany private contact with the ethics committee, a decision in linewith its belief that he is acting more as a staff member of thepanel than as a prosecutor.   It also directed Phelan to investigate further the Sabine Lakegas drilling venture which boosted Wright's worth substantiallylast year.   The investment involves a gas well near the Texas-Louisianaline, which Wright and Mallick bought into for $9,120 last January.They sold their interest less than five months later for a $340,000profit, even though the well's production had dwindled.   The committee wants to know whether the deal amounted to anothergift to Wright by investors seeking to curry favor with a powerfullegislator. The panel last week interviewed five Texans involved inthe well deal and decided other witnesses still need to be heardfrom, Dixon said.   Wright's defense team, beefed up this week to include eightlawyers, filed a new motion on Wednesday asking that the two mostserious charges be dismissed because they are based on faultyinterpretation of House rules.   The attorneys asked that the ethics panel drop charges thatWright evaded House rules limiting outside earned income throughbulk sales of a book he wrote, and that the speaker improperlyaccepted $145,000 in gifts from Fort Worth developer GeorgeMallick, who was deemed to have had a direct interest inlegislation before Congress.   The charges amount to ``a house of cards delicately balanced ona series of unprecedented reinterpretations of House rules,''according to the motion.   One member of the defense team, Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,said it is clear that House rules have grown outmoded and need tobe revised. ``They are dated, time has passed, circumstances havechanged and ethical standards have appropriately risen,'' he said.   But he said the ethics committee is seeking to apply thosehigher standards to Wright retroactively, which is unfair to thespeaker.   Also on Wednesday, chief Justice Department spokesman DavidRunkel said the department plans an independent review of Wright'sbusiness and political dealings once the House ethics process runsits course.   ``I expect the department will take an independent look'' shouldthe House exonerate Wright, Runkel said. The department has beencollecting publicly available information on the Wright case forseveral months, and plans to have its public integrity sectionreview the evidence for possible criminal violations.   Runkel said such a review would cover matters brought up by theethics committee and ``other matters that have been raised,'' suchas Wright's involvement in a 1985 political fund-raising effort inTexas.   In testimony last week at a federal fraud trial in Dallas,Wright was linked to a political action committee that collectedallegedly illegal contributions from officials of Commodore Savingsand Loan, an insolvent Texas thrift. A witness said Wright was saidto have promised to block legislation seen as unfavorable by theSandamp;L industry in return for $250,000 in donations to the PAC, butWright has denied the charge.   On Wednesday, three former Commodore employees testified theygave money to the PAC, known as East Texas First, and later werereimbursed by their company, either through pay increases or checksfor fictional travel.   Former Commodore president E. Morten Hopkins, his brother Robertand John W. Harrell, former Commodore CEO and vice chairman of theboard, are being tried on charges they misused Commodore funds tomake illegal PAC contributions.   East Texas First raised and spent about $100,000 to help Rep.Jim Chapman, D-Texas, win the 1985 special election.</TEXT></DOC>
