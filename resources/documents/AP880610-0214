Kirk Jr.appealed to Democratic platform writers Friday to draft a documentthat addresses concerns of working families, not a Yellow Pages ofads ``for every organized group.''   As a 16-member drafting committee began work, however,representatives of apparent nominee Michael Dukakis and rival JesseJackson said the ``discussion paper'' they started out with _ a2,000-word document penned by one-time John F. Kennedy speechwriterTheodore Sorensen _ was too general.   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's emissary, said the Sorensenpaper ``contains almost no specifics.''   Michael Barnes, representating Dukakis, said the platform willhave to give voters more details on how the Democrats will grapplewith the spread of AIDS and help the homeless.   ``We need to indicate where we're going and how we're going toget there,'' he said.   Kirk, in a brief appearance before leaving this island nearMichigan's Upper Peninsula, exhorted the Democrats to write with``the so-called swing voters,'' not special interests, in mind.   ``You never get a second chance to make a first impression,''said Kirk, who wants a short, visionary platform.   The Sorensen paper, in the form of a declaration by ``we thepeople of the Democratic Party,'' denounces ``voodoo economics,''condemns ``South Africa's hateful apartheid, government-sponsoredterrorism,'' and mentions in passing a need ``to find more homesand food for those who are homeless and hungry ... and to find moreaid for those who have AIDS.''   Kirk said the party needs ``a pragmatic, principled and positivestatement that American people can read and reflect upon and say,`That's the kind of country I want my kids to grow up in.'''   He told reporters the party does not need to spell out dollarfigures or precise program goals in its platform.   ``I don't think we'll end up with the Yellow Pages, an ad forevery organized group,'' he said.   Rep. William Gray III, the Philadelphia congressman and Jacksonsupporter who is chairing the drafting sessions, assured the panelmembers, ``You are going to write the platform.''   He said his goal was not to produce a document this weekend, butto build a consensus in preparation for next month's convention inAtlanta.   The drafting committee adjourned after a 90-minute afternoonsession in which the members agreed they need strong stands oncivil rights, drugs, housing, health and education.   Gray then met privately with Barnes, Norton and others to try toforge common language on those issues. He put off until the weekenddiscussion of the economy and foreign affairs.   Norton expressed discomfort with the pace, telling reporters,``It is going too slowly. You don't know what differences you haveuntil you get down to cold language.''   James B. Booe, secretary-treasurer of the Communications Workersof America and one of the drafters, said the Democrats need ``aplatform that any Democrat can run with instead of from,'' not onethat would ``get us tangled up with too many specifics.''   Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin said the platform should be adocument school children can read.   But Leslie McLemore, a political science professor at JacksonState University in Mississippi, said, ``There are some schoolchildren in my state who cannot read and that's why (on) educationand other issues we have to be specific.''   McLemore, a Jackson delegate, said, ``Winning is important, butwinning and losing the very heart and soul of this party, andmisleading the American people is not an enterprise that I wish tobe a part of.''   Gray said there will be a draft ready for the full 186-memberPlatform Committee to consider when it meets in Denver June 25-26.   He said no one expected Sorensen's paper to be the final word.   ``As we go through the discussion of issues _ drugs, education,civil rights, health care ... hopefully they'll realize that theirdifferences are not that great and begin to come to a consensus ontheir own,'' Gray said.   Norton said, ``Our concern would only have been if the twocandidates did not have a free hand to draft the kind of platformthat they and they alone deserve to draft, because they attractedthe largest number of votes.''   She said Sorensen's language on South Africa was ``one of thebetter parts of this document'' but still needed to be stronger.   ``The motherhood issue of this campaign has been drugs. Thereprobably is more the American people would like to have us sayabout drugs,'' she added.   Sorensen, who will sit on the full Platform Committee, toldreporters he stood ready to help the drafters, but if he was notneeded ``I brought my tennis racket.'</TEXT></DOC>
