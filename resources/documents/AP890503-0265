On a 49-2 vote just before midnight Tuesday, the committeeapproved Bush's $90 billion savings and loan plan _ the largestfinancial bailout in the nation's history _ after spending fourdays toughening capital standards on the industry and adding a pairof housing components.   Only Reps. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., and Jim Leach, R-Iowa, votedno. Kennedy said the bill did not have enough housing support forthe poor and complained about the panel's rejection of hisprovisions attacking lending discrimination. Leach said he wantedstill tougher capital standards.   As it now stands, the House bill would require the nation's3,000 thrifts to put up at least $20 billion in new capital overthe next five years _ twice as much as a version approved by theSenate two weeks ago _ to fulfill Bush's promise of ``Never again.''   It also would divorce what critics had called a too-cozyrelationship between Sandamp;L regulators and the industry and devote $75million a year to investigating and prosecuting fraud that isblamed for a major portion of the crisis.   On a party-line vote, committee Democrats overrodeadministration objections to set aside some of the property thegovernment is inheriting from failed Sandamp;Ls for low-income housing.They also voted to require the industry to subsidize below-marketmortgage rates for low-income families.   Still, the overall package won praise from the administration.   ``This committee exceeded everyone's expectations,'' AssistantTreasury Secretary David Mullins said. ``They've achieved somethingvery close to what we asked for.''   The biggest victory for the administration is a requirement thatSandamp;L owners over the next five years reach a level of having atleast $3 of their own money in ``tangible'' capital at risk forevery $100 they lend.   ``We've moved legislation that will deal with a significant partof the problem ... and passed tough capital standards _ better thanthe Senate bill and, I would argue, better than the Bush bill aswell,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.   The bill still has to go through three other committees _including one where the erection of a formidable roadblock isanticipated later this month _ before a final vote by the fullHouse.   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, the banking committee'schairman who spearheaded the administration's drive for the toughercapital requirements, said industry lobbying efforts to weaken themalready have shifted there.   And after that, new fights over the housing subsidies that wererejected in the Senate as ``social engineering'' are expected toerupt in a conference of leading lawmakers from both houses beforea final version is sent to Bush this summer for his approval orveto.   As proposed by Bush and now approved by both the House BankingCommittee and the Senate, the plan will pump $50 billion over thenext three years into a federal insurance fund to pay offdepositors whose money was lost through speculative and oftenfraudulent lending by some 300 to 500 Sandamp;Ls.   Another $40 billion to cover the losses of institutions closedin the past two years plus anticipated failures over the nextdecade _ and also shore up the insurance fund _ will come largelyfrom new or increased fees on the industry.   Altogether, the bailout costs _ including interest _ areexpected to total $157 billion by the year 2000 and $275 billion bythe year 2020.   The government share will be raised through a complex financingplan that keeps the problem off the federal budget and avoids a taxincrease, but at an interest cost to taxpayers of $150 billion to$200 billion over the next 30 years.   That arrangement is likely to be questioned at least one moretime by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, one ofthree panels yet to review the package.   However, the next big showdown will not occur until the billreaches the House Rules Committee, which controls what issues canbe revisited on the House floor.   The rules panel's chairman, Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., said ina letter last week he strongly opposes parts of the new capitalrequirements.   Industry and government records indicate that 14 Sandamp;Ls in Floridawould have to raise a total of $700 million to $800 million in newcapital over the next five years or shrink in size.   Rep. Steve Bartlett, R-Texas, said he expects the housingprovisions in the bill to be attacked on the House floor, alongwith what he called one ``crystalizing amendment'' to stretch outthe implementation of the tougher capital standards.   But he predicted the fights there will be few and short.   ``Everybody in the country and the Congress realizes we need toget this enacted and behind us,'' Bartlett said. ``The bill shouldbe signed by the president by the Fourth of July.''</TEXT></DOC>
