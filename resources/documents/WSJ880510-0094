He spent his early career, after graduation from Harvard, on the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee under Sen. J. William Fulbright. As it happens, that was excellent preparation for his current job. There is nothing more useful for running a bioengineering company today than a solid grounding in politics.    &quot;If I hadn't had a background in Congress we would have been hung up on some tree a long time ago,&quot; says Mr. Henry. &quot;We view Washington as a business discipline, just like manufacturing, research, marketing or sales. In our business it is absolute. If you don't do it right and you don't get government approvals and you don't win public acceptance, this technology is not going to go.&quot;    Legal and political obstacles to genetic experimentation are formidable. Objections seldom are soundly based in science but that does not make them any less troublesome to companies trying to alter organisms and apply them to useful purposes, such as the creation of new therapeutic drugs or new ways to control crop infestations. The truly remarkable thing is that one man named Jeremy Rifkin, neither a scientist nor representative of any established environmental movement, often has been able to stop such projects in their tracks. He has proved to be skillful in manipulating the press, the courts and politicians by exploiting those age-old enemies of science, ignorance and fear.    Mr. Henry, a political pragmatist, simply accepts this irrational reality and tries to deal with it. He acknowledges that Mr. Rifkin, insignificant as he might at first seem to a vast, technology-based economy, has been able to set the agenda for biotechnology. &quot;If he wants predictive ecology, our routine is predictive ecology,&quot; says the Crop Genetics chairman.    Crop Genetics has a discovery that could be of great benefit to agriculture if it proves out in field tests. The company was co-founded in 1981 by Mr. Henry, by then a Wall Street lawyer, and Peter Carlson, a plant geneticist of some renown.    Mr. Carlson was a Michigan State professor and pharmaceutical-industry consultant when the two teamed up. They decided that the most effective and environmentally desirable way of protecting plants against insects would be to build the insecticide into the plant. This wasn't an entirely new idea but the approach Prof. Carlson had in mind -- to, in effect, &quot;vaccinate&quot; seeds and then let the plant itself produce the insecticide as it developed -- was indeed novel.    The two decided to focus their efforts on the European corn borer, which causes about $400 million in damage to the American corn crop each year. Crop Genetics &quot;gene jockeys&quot; set about extracting the active gene from a commonly used bacteriological insecticide known as Bt, which has been used for years to spray national forests for gypsy moths. Bt is harmless to birds and mammals since it is toxic only to animals with alkaline digestive tracts, that is to say members of the caterpillar family. The gene was spliced into another microorganism called an endophyte, which exists only in the vascular system of plants. Using either a vacuum or pressure technique the seed corn could be impregnated with the altered endophyte.    The company thus produced an altered microorganism that could not live outside the host plant, would die with the plant and therefore could not spread through nature. The same technique is theoretically applicable to other plants, such as wheat, cotton, rice and sorghum. If it passes the all-important field tests, it could have great potential. It conceivably could replace the huge amounts of chemical insecticides applied to cornfields each year, a practice that for years has raised concerns among environmentalists. Only a tiny part of a chemical application actually reaches the target pests. The Crop Genetics method theoretically will kill far more insects with far less material.    But despite these beauties, Mr. Henry knew he would have problems. He was able to float $23 million in common stock with the aid of Drexel Burnham but gave equal importance to his political campaign. &quot;We sought the advice of people who knew Washington, the Environmental Protection Agency and environmental law. Elliott Richardson {former attorney general and recurrent cabinet secretary} is on our board. Also Sol Linowitz {former Xerox chairman and Carter administration diplomatic trouble-shooter}.&quot; Reagan arms controller Paul Nitze invested $500,000 in the company. Former EPA head William D. Ruckelshaus was made head of a special advisory committee.    The company developed a four-part strategy. First, it went to the regulators and asked them what the safety issues were. The potential for spread of the microorganism was of course one. The result was a protocol for &quot;the most expensive agricultural field tests in the history of the world&quot; at some $3 million or more for several one-acre tests. &quot;We spent $50,000 just to prove that the Bt that has been on the market was the same as we put in this.&quot; But Mr. Henry feels it is worth it.    The second strategy involved what he calls the goldfish bowl. Companies traditionally have tried to keep research secret until they were sure of what they had. Crop Genetics went public from the start. Its headquarters and test site are in Hanover, Md., &quot;so we went to over 40 politicians in the state of Maryland from the governor to Sens. Sarbanes and Mikulski on down to the local level&quot; to tell them what was going on.    The third strategy was to emphasize the public interest. &quot;Here we have this right arm of government, this Paul Bunyan bicep in its Popeye form that regulates and we have this deformed left arm in a sling when it comes to promoting positives. So we decided that rather than sit back and wait for ourselves to be regulated we would be more activist in terms of getting the imprimatur of the government to work with us.&quot; The company had deliberately set up shop on a site just down the road from the Agriculture Department's big Beltsville research center. So it asked Beltsville to join in the tests. &quot;Now Rifkin has screamed conflict of interest, but it was putting ourselves in a goldfish bowl because the government scientists are going to write papers on our product,&quot; says Mr. Henry. To hedge its bets, Crop Genetics also set up an experiment in France in cooperation with the French government researchers, taking advantage of the fact that &quot;the French are goo-goo on biotech and they love agriculture.&quot;    And finally, Mr. Henry made approaches to the environmental movement. &quot;We discovered that there was a foundation in Chicago, the Joyce Foundation, which contributes to the Environmental Defense Fund, the Audubon Society and the National Wildlife Federation. We sent three experts and gave them a 450-page document and we got support for this test. All three groups are on record as not opposing a limited test.&quot; Crop Genetics of course cited the environmental dangers of chemicals.    What is the result of all this so far? Jeremy Rifkin still threatens to sue. The USDA and EPA haven't given field-test permits, although that could happen soon. Crop Genetics will plant some corn and inoculate the plants later if need be. Stay tuned. </TEXT></DOC>
