Total cost of the mill and associated research facilities was estimated at 65 million dollars. Repap, Montreal, is a pulp and paper concern, and operates a large paper mill here.    The government called the outlay a &quot;contribution.&quot; A Repap official said it amounted to &quot;a grant with conditions.&quot;    The mill will use the &quot;Alcell&quot; process developed by a Repap unit, which substitutes ethanol for traditional alkaline and acid-based cooking materials in the pulping process.    Construction is slated to begin immediately with completion expected in about 10 months, the Repap official said. The mill will have annual capacity of about 11,000 metric tons of pulp and will employ 50 people. </TEXT></DOC>
