The survey of executive pay at European manufacturingcompanies found that, on average, managing directors ofmedium-sized Swiss concerns earn the equivalent of $230,475before taxes and $144,000 after taxes. That's 28% more thanEurope's next best-paid managers, the West Germans; 31% morethan the Italians; and 42% more than the French. And itdwarfs the lowly British pay rates of 68,500 ($115,970)pretax and 44,627 net. Other executive pay scales showsimilar national trends.   The gaps stem partly from national differences in taxrates and business climate. But as 1992 approaches, thedifferentials are expected to diminish, according to thestudy by nine European consulting companies.   Tying executive pay to performance is another trend theconsultants see slowly spreading. In France, West Germany andSwitzerland, 80% to 90% of managing directors get somecompensation in the form of performance bonuses. The Britishopt for share options, with 70% of top executives in largecompanies participating in such plans.                                                                                                          PINK SLIPS IN EAST GERMANY                                                                                                          More than 100 general directors of East Germanstate-controlled companies have been relieved of theirduties, the East Berlin Economics Ministry said. The moveimplemented a cabinet decision made on May 9. East Germany'sstate-controlled conglomerates are being turned intocommon-stock companies that will eventually be privatized aspart of the nation's efforts to convert its economy tofree-market principles.                                                                                                          TAIWAN PROTECTS WILDLIFE                                                                                                          Taiwan officials burned more than a ton of confiscatedivory and 11 lion skins, altogether valued at an estimated$3.7 million. &quot;The government is determined to implement itspolicy to protect wildlife and reverse the nation'sunfavorable image,&quot; an official of the Agriculture Councilsaid. In June, Taiwan passed a law imposing a maximumthree-year prison term for the import or sale of ivory andwild animals.                                                                                                          YUGOSLAVIAN SHUTDOWN                                                                                                          Yugoslavia's only nuclear-power plant, at Krsko inSlovenia, will be shut down by 1995, the Slovenian dailyDelor reported. The plant accounts for 20% of the powergeneration in Slovenia and about 3% of Yugoslavia'spower-generating potential. The plan to close the plant,which has been plagued by malfunctioning incidents, waslikely to be cheered by Slovenia's environmentalists, whohave been campaigning for a shutdown, and by neighboringAustria, whose government repeatedly expressed concern aboutthe plant's safety.                                                                                                          COCOM EASES RESTRICTIONS                                                                                                          East and West German officials said the 17 member nationsof the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral ExportControls, or COCOM, agreed in principle to ease theirrestrictions on most technology exports to East Germany.However, a spokesman for the East German government saidmembers of COCOM, which was formed to restrict exports ofstrategic items to communist-bloc nations, would still wantto maintain controls on weapons and other defense items.                                                                                                          SWITZERLAND TO JOIN AID BANK                                                                                                          The Swiss Federal Council decided Switzerland will jointhe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The newinstitution, which is to have 42 members, will provide fundsto aid the emerging market economies of Eastern Europe.Switzerland's share of the bank's total capital of 10 billionEuropean Currency Units ($12.26 billion) will be 2.28%.                                                                                                          TOO RISQUE FOR THE FRENCH                                                                                                          A poster campaign to persuade the French to use morecondoms has been dropped after it was deemed too shocking forbillboards.   A government agency fighting AIDS said the $1.4 millioncampaign, to be launched next week, would now appear only inmagazines and newspapers and on television. The primeminister's office decided the French were not yet ready forposter-size versions depicting a huge condom accompanied bymessages such as &quot;72% of French people claim to be in love.How many prove it?&quot;   Condoms &quot;are still a tricky subject in France compared toother countries,&quot; said Dominique Charvet of thegovernment-backed French Agency to Fight AIDS.   Ms. Charvet concluded: &quot;There's a big difference betweenmagazines and television screens, which are in the privacy ofpeople's homes, and big posters splashed around town.&quot;                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .
