The guerrillas blamed the loss of the Samarkhiel garrisonThursday on a shortage of weapons and manpower.   Abdul Kabir, a rebel spokesman, said Afghan government troopsplowed through guerrilla-held positions before being halted aboutseven miles east of Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan.   ``We couldn't hold on,'' said Azim Nasser-Zia, whose guerrillashad held Samarkhiel. ``The mujahedeen didn't even have enoughweapons for their own defence.''   Kabir agreed.   ``We have a problem with this. We have only small weapons or onesthat are not in good working condition.''   Nasser-Zia said the loss of Samarkhiel, which had been capturedby the U.S.-backed guerrillas early in March, was a crushing blow.   ``The only victory since the Russian withdrawal, and we loseit,'' he said.   The Soviet army pulled the last of its troops from Afghanistan inFebruary, ending a nine-year military involvement in the civil war.The guerrillas have been fighting 11 years to oust Afghanistan'sMarxist government.   The insurgents, who call themselves mujahedeen, or Islamic holywarriors, launched an attack on Jalalabad in early March. After amonth of some of the bloodiest fighting in 10 years of war, theoffensive ended in a stalemate.   The battle for Jalalabad destroyed predictions that the Kabulgovernment would collapse soon after the Soviet troop withdrawal.   Nasser-Zia also blamed the defeat on the interim guerrillagovernment, saying it has drained many of the will to fight.   The government was formed with the idea it would replace theAfghanistan government, but it only has representatives from theguerrilla parties based in Pakistan.   It does not include representation for guerrillas based in Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
