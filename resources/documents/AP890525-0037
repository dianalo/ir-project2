(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Engineers analyzed radio data andinspected a failed engine valve today to learn why the launch of ahigh-tech navigation satellite was aborted at the last second.   Wednesday night's postponement was the fourth in five days forthe launch of the Delta 2.   After the engine ignition command was given, a computer sensed astuck fuel valve and stopped the Delta 2 rocket's main engine fromfiring.   ``We have a main engine cutoff,'' reported Lt. Col. Ron Rand,the Air Force launch commentator.   The 12-story-tall rocket remained locked firmly on the launchpad. Rand said the launch team used remote controls to stabilizepressures and make the vehicle safe.   ``At no time were we in a hazardous condition,'' said the launchtest director, Air Force Lt. Col. Bob Tayloe.   The Delta 2 was to have boosted into orbit a $65 million Navstarsatellite that will enable U.S. and allied military units such asships, planes, submarines and tanks to determine their locationwithin 50 feet anywhere on the globe.   Tayloe said no new launch date would be set until experts learnwhat went wrong and the problem is fixed. He said the delay wouldbe at least a few days.   He said a valve in the main liquid oxygen propellant line failedto open. The engine ignition command had been given, he said, ``butwith no oxygen, the engine sequence shut down.''   The valve failure meant the engine did not get enough fuel. Theoxygen mixes with a kerosene-like propellant to power thespacecraft.   Small steering rockets at the base of the Delta 2 flashed tolife when the ignition command was given.   But the main engine start is delayed 2.3 seconds to allowpropellant to flow into the ignition chamber and to give thecomputer a chance to determine if anything is wrong.   If the propellant flows properly, the main engine ignites andpressures build up, a signal for nine solid fuel booster rocketssurrounding the engine to fire and start the rocket on its way.   ``Without the proper pressure reading, the signal did not go tothe solids,'' Tayloe said.   The cutoff, at 7:48 p.m., occurred in the final seconds of anine-minute launch opportunity, dictated by the requirement tolaunch the satellite into the proper orbit. The first part of thelaunch ``window'' was eaten up while a weather plane inspectedclouds suspected of containing potentially dangerous lightning.   When none was detected, the all-clear was given.</TEXT></DOC>
