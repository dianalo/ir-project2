The work represents the latest advance in research on&quot;transgenic&quot; animals, which contain artificially insertedforeign genes. During the past few years, many transgenicanimals have been developed using a technique in whichscientists add or randomly knock out genes. Now, however, anew technique is emerging that enables researchers to knockout or replace specific genes. The development of the newmouse strain represents one of the first applications of thismore powerful way to make &quot;designer&quot; animals.</LP><TEXT>   Scientists are racing to use this new technique to mimichuman genetic diseases in mice and to investigate functionsof specific genes. Among other things, the work promises toshed light on how certain genes predispose people to cancerand how inherited diseases might be treated or prevented. Italso throws into sharper relief the issues raised byscientists' growing power to manipulate genes in animals.   &quot;We're bringing things into the orbit of manipulation thatpreviously weren't at our disposal,&quot; said Stuart Newman, anembryologist at New York Medical College who has writtenabout ethical issues in transgenic animal research. &quot;We haveto be aware of possible pain, distress and physicalderangement in transgenic animals and balance that againstthe benefits&quot; of research on them.   The new strain of mutant mice were developed by scientistsat Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the WhiteheadInstitute, a biomedical research establishment affiliatedwith MIT. They deactivated a gene indirectly responsible forproduction of a crucial immune-system protein, called MHC-1.The mice look normal, but they lack both MHC-1 and killer Tcells, said Rudolf Jaenisch, who led the research with MIT'sDavid Raulet.   Many researchers believe one function of the T cells is tokill cells that turn cancerous. Scientists now caninvestigate that theory by studying whether the mutant miceare prone to cancer.   The work, reported in today's issue of the journal Nature,also promises to advance organ-transplant technology. MHC-1occurs in each cell of normal animals, serving as a flag tothe immune system that the cell belongs to &quot;self&quot; andshouldn't be attacked as a foreign invader. Cells fromdifferent animals have different MHC-1 molecules. Thus, whencells are transplanted from one animal to another, therecipient's immune system senses and attacks them as aliens,causing transplant rejection.   Tissues from the mice without MHC-1 may not be detectableas foreign by the immune system, hence may not be subject torejection when transplanted. If so, scientists someday may beable to develop similar tissues without MHC-1 to use astransplants that wouldn't be rejected, Mr. Jaenisch said.   The new technique springs from research in the early 1980sled by British scientist Martin Evans, who showed thatforeign genes could be placed in mouse embryos at an earlystate of development. Later, other researchers developed waysto alter specific genes in the embryonic cells. Recently,scientists have begun producing strains of mice that can passsuch altered genes to their offspring.   The new technique &quot;eventually will supplantmicro-injection,&quot; the less-powerful method now usually usedto make transgenic animals, said Oliver Smithies, aUniversity of North Carolina researcher who helped developthe new method. Micro-injection involves placing foreigngenetic material with microscopic instruments into newlyfertilized embryos. It has been used by a number of companiestrying to develop transgenic animals that grow faster, resistdisease or produce human drugs in their milk.</TEXT></DOC>
