He said that in an era of ``extraordinary change'' in the SovietUnion, ``We have an obligation to temper optimism _ and I amoptimistic _ with prudence.'' His comments came in remarks atBoston University, where he shared commencement speaking duty withFrench President Francois Mitterrand. Bush returned to Washingtonon Sunday night.   Pointing to Moscow's threat to retain some nuclear missilesbanned by a 1987 treaty if NATO upgrades its short-range arsenal,Bush said, ``It is clear that Soviet `new thinking' has not yettotally overcome the old.''   Later, in a two-language joint news conference, Bush andMitterrand both expressed optimism that a rift within NATO overshort-range European missiles could be bridged before next week'sNATO summit.   A spokesman for the West German government, Hans Klein, saidBonn also is confident that a resolution can be reached before themeeting. He said one proposal forms a basis for a solution but noagreement has yet been reached.   Bush said: ``I think we could well have this resolved before thesummit.''   He said American officials have been in close touch with BritishPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher on the missile issue, adding thathe agrees with her that ``we can get together on this vexingquestion ...''   ``My role has been behind the scenes, to be helpful in workingthis problem ... to iron out those differences,'' Bush said.   Mitterrand said NATO periodically faces internal controversiessuch as the current one, adding he was hopeful this latestdifficulty would be resolved before the summit opens. ``I'd behappy if the views can be reconciled,'' the French leader said.   Mitterrand fielded one news conference question by dismissing acomment from White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater that SovietLeader Mikhail Gorbachev was a ``drugstore cowboy'' whose armscontrol proposals lack substance.   ``Mr. Gorbachev is worth very much more than that,'' Mitterrandsaid, dismissing ``caricatures.''   As the words were translated, Bush laughed and said, ``So muchfor Marlin.'' He added, ``I could defend Marlin'' _ but he neitherdid that nor disavowed the spokesman's earlier remark.   Mitterrand devoted his commencement address remarks largely tothe environment and said, ``The earth is our planet, so let us saveit.''   The two leaders flew here together after a day of talks Saturdayat Bush's vacation estate overlooking the Atlantic Ocean on a rockypoint in Kennebunkport, Maine.   They spoke before a commencement audience estimated at 31,000people attending the ceremony at Nickerson Field football stadium.In the hometown of Gov. Michael Dukakis, his defeated rival for theWhite House, Bush got a standing ovation. But the cheers forDukakis, also on the stage, were louder.   Bush's speech was designed to set the stage for the NATO summitopening in Brussels on May 29. The 16-nation meeting has beenthreatened by discord over short-range nuclear missiles in centralEurope.   Over opposition from the United States and Britain, West Germanyhas been leading a call for East-West negotiations to reduce theweapons, and has been resisting plans to upgrade the missiles.   The dispute has been aggravated by a series of disarmamentoffers from Moscow that have put pressure on the West to takesimilar steps.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell criticized Bush lastweek, saying he was responding too timidly to arms proposals fromthe Soviet Union.   Praising French and British programs to upgrade their nuclearweapons, Bush said, ``We do have a major concern. There's a growingcomplacency throughout the West.''   Underscoring his remark, he said there was ``a great irony'' inthat ``while an ideological earthquake is shaking asunder the verycommunist foundation, the West is being tested by complacency.''   ``We must never forget that twice in this century, Americanblood has been shed over conflicts that began in Europe,'' Bushsaid.   Calling the Atlantic Alliance central to U.S. foreign policy,Bush said, ``We must never forget that to keep the peace in Europeis to keep the peace for America.''   Without referring directly to the missile dispute, Bush saidnuclear weapons are an essential ingredient for the defense ofEurope.   ``Our short-range deterrent forces based in Europe, and kept upto date, demonstrate that America's vital interests are boundinextricably to Western Europe and that an attacker can nevergamble on a test of strength with just our conventional forces,''the president said.   ``Though hope is now running high for a more peaceful continent,the history of this century teaches Americans and Europeans toremain prepared,'' Bush said.   He said he was grateful for steps taken by Gorbachev, saying``If the Soviets advance solid and constructive plans for peace,then we should give credit where credit is due.   ``We are seeing sweeping changes in the Soviet Union that showpromise of enduring, of becoming ingrained,'' Bush said.   ``At the same time, in an era of extraordinary change, we havean obligation to temper optimism _ and I am optimistic _ withprudence.''   Bush said, ``I believe in a step-by-step approach to East-Westrelations because recurring signs show that while change in theSoviet Union is dramatic, it is not yet complete.''   He said the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact retains nearly a 12-to-1advantage over the Atlantic Alliance in short-range missile androcket launchers and more than a 2-to-1 edge in battle tanks.   On an economic front, Bush spoke warmly yet cautiously aboutWestern Europe's plans for a single common market free of internaltrade barriers by 1992.   He said that despite apprehensions in some quarters about what aunited Europe will bring, ``this administration is of one mind. Webelieve a strong, united Europe means a strong America.''   ``...it is important to distinguish adversaries from allies andallies from adversaries,'' Bush said. ``What a tragedy _ what anabsurdity _ it would be if future historians attribute the demiseof the Western Alliance to disputes over beef hormones and warsover pasta.'' That was a reference to two trade areas that haveseparated the United States and Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
