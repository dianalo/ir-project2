On average, the money managers had portfolio losses of 2.7% for the year ended June 30, according to CDA Investment Technologies Inc., a Bethesda, Md., research company. That's a bit better than the 6.9% drop in the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index. Still, it shows that last October's market crash is casting a long shadow over money managers' records.    A top performer in the CDA survey was Moran Asset Management Inc. of Greenwich, Conn., which was up 25.4% for the year. Fred Moran, president of the company, said a lot of the gain reflected an emphasis on cellular telephone and cable television stocks. With cellular phones in particular, Mr. Moran said, &quot;I don't think the investment community grasps the magnitude of the growth in that industry.&quot;    A little luck also helped Moran Asset last year. The company's cash reserves ballooned before the crash, in part because it was having trouble investing new clients' funds. Those funds ended up being protected from the market plunge, and could be invested afterward when stocks were much cheaper.    Moran Asset is fully invested currently, though Mr. Moran said he is a bit worried about rising interest rates and inflation. Even so, he maintains: &quot;Our stocks are so attractive we're compelled to overlook the macroeconomic picture.&quot;    Also achieving big gains was Capital Technology, a Charlotte, N.C., company that manages $180 million and invests in small-company stocks. Its equity portfolios gained 23.1% for the year ended June 30. Capital's president, Robb Rowe, said he is emphasizing data-processing and electronics stocks, as well as dabbling in some cyclical stocks such as rubber and chemical producers.    Some other equity managers took quite a pounding, though. At the bottom of the pack was Kenneth J. Gerbino andamp; Co., down 22.2%. Several other companies also had losses of more than 20%. The CDA rankings are based on data supplied by the investment advisers themselves. These include both cash positions and intra-quarter trades, which weren't part of CDA's earlier surveys.    As for bond managers, those surveyed by CDA had an average gain of 7.9% for the year ended June 30, slightly behind the 8.1% rise in the Salomon Brothers Broad Investment Grade bond index. Leading performers included several companies that use foreign bonds; they were generally aided by the dollar's slump last year.    The top bond performer, Lotsoff Capital Management of Chicago, had a 14.0% gain. It generally held short-maturity bonds, which fare relatively well in times of rising rates. It also benefited from Treasury bond options it owned last October, which soared in value as interest rates fell after the stock-market crash. One of the company's managing directors, Seymour M. Lotsoff, said he is sticking to short-maturity bonds because &quot;I'm not optimistic about interest rates.&quot;    The following table shows the top 10 equity investment advisers in CDA's survey for the year ended June 30.
