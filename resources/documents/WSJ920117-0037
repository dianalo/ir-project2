The new computer-data storage system will hold more than100 times as much information as the current industrystandard. In October, Storage Technology, based inLouisville, Colo., announced its plans to develop such aproduct, along with other tape-library products, but didn'tdisclose the source of the helical-scan technology. Robotictape libraries store and retrieve data in much the same way ajukebox plays records.</LP><TEXT>   The new product is a bit slower than other tape-librarysystems, but because of its massive storage capacity, StorageTechnology thinks it will be popular with supercomputerusers. Joseph Beal, a Storage Technology vice president,wouldn't estimate the size of the market for the new product,but said it would be a major part of the company's productline. Storage Technology has more than 90% of the market forautomated tape libraries.f</TEXT></DOC>
