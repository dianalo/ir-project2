Most of his rivals,campaigning in the tobacco belt in advance of Super Tuesday,support the government's tobacco price support program.   In response to a survey by The Associated Press, nearly all thecandidates said they would maintain or intensify efforts todiscourage people from smoking. Seven of 10 said they back thegovernment's price support program.   But Robertson wants to snuff out the tobacco industry entirelyover 10 years and stiffen taxes on cigarettes to help pay forlong-term health care for the elderly.   The AP surveyed the candidates about tobacco and smoking as theygird for the March 8 round of primaries across the South, wheretobacco may no longer be king but remains the top cash crop.   Tobacco provides wages and benefits of more than $14 billion ayear for 710,000 people across the region.   With the exception of Robertson and Democrats Gary Hart and PaulSimon, the candidates favor continuing the price support programfor tobacco, which guarantees growers a minimum price and regulateshow much they can produce.   Vice President George Bush said, ``I support the law requiringthe tobacco program to be run at no net cost to the federalgovernment.''   Bush did not reply to a separate question about whether he wouldexpand government anti-smoking efforts.   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee raised eyebrows at aDemocrats' debate in Iowa in January when he brought up the deathtoll caused by smoking and said that despite the 100,000 tobaccofarmers in Tennessee, ``I don't think there should be any publicsubsidy of tobacco at all.''   But in subsequent campaign appearances in the South and again inresponse to the AP survey, Gore made clear that he is no critic ofthe tobacco price support program, which he said ``does not rely atall on taxpayers' dollars ... (and) helps many small tobaccofarmers stay in business.''   Gore added, ``I believe the government should do everything inits power to educate the public about the hazards associated withsmoking.'' He said he supports stronger warning labels on cigarettepackages.   Gore, himself, quit growing tobacco on a family farm after hissister Nancy died of lung cancer in 1984.   Democrat Jesse Jackson strongly defended the price supportprogram, although he favors shifting more of its benefits to small,family farms.   But Jackson added: ``We have to recognize that 350,000 deathsper year are related to smoking. The government must beef-upeducational efforts to inform the public of this hazard.'' He saidthe government should consider using revenues from the 16-centexcise tax on cigarettes to assist tobacco farmers who want toswitch to other crops.   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis said he supports tobaccoprice supports, as well as ``a vigorous public health campaign toencourage smokers to quit and to discourage young people fromtaking up the habit.''   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said he supports the currentfederal tobacco program, as well as a ban on smoking on shortcommercial flights and ``an active public education campaign''against smoking.   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who is not campaigning in the SuperTuesday states, favors doubling the excise tax on cigarettes.   Of price supports, Simon said: ``The tobacco industry is veryclear about getting the message across that the current tobaccoprogram does not cost the taxpayers. While that may be true ... thefact is that smoking costs all of us greatly. I believe we mustexpand government efforts to discourage people from smoking.''   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said it is unlikelythat the United States would ever outlaw smoking. If it eliminateddomestic tobacco production, American smokers would just be forcedto use ``lower quality, imported'' tobacco with ``no real gains inpublic health,'' he said.   Robertson said smoking-related deaths cost the nation at least$65 billion a year. He called for earmarking revenues from a users'fee on tobacco ``exclusively for meeting the long-term health careneeds of our older citizens.''   Robertson has called for a government buyout of farmers' tobaccoallotments over 10 years and tax breaks to allow tobacco companiesto phase out their investments.   The Associated Press asked all the presidential candidates onFeb. 11:   ``Do you support the current federal price support program fortobacco? Would you expand government efforts to discourage peoplefrom smoking?''   All replied in writing except Hart, whose positions wereoutlined by a campaign aide.   Here are the Republicans' replies:</TEXT><HEAD>GEORGE BUSH</HEAD><TEXT>   ``I support the law requiring the tobacco program to be run atno net cost to the federal government.''</TEXT><HEAD>ROBERT DOLE</HEAD><TEXT>   ``One of the most misunderstood aspects of tobacco is thegovernment price support program, sometimes called `the tobaccosubsidy.' ... The Commodity Credit Corporation, which administerscommodity stabilization programs for USDA, has in the past incurredminor expenses in the tobacco program _ only $58 million over aperiod of 50 years prior to 1984. Meanwhile, federal, state, andlocal excise taxes collected from the sale of tobacco products haveexceeded $150 billion.   ``I have supported efforts to increase public awareness of thepotential dangers of smoking. It seems unlikely that smoking willbe outlawed in the U.S. and tobacco imports will undoubtedlycontinue, regardless of U.S. production. In other words, if theU.S. eliminated tobacco production, those U.S. citizens choosing tosmoke would do so using lower quality, imported foreign tobaccoinstead of U.S. produced tobacco.''</TEXT><HEAD>JACK KEMP</HEAD><TEXT>   ``I have not proposed any major reforms in the federal `no netcost' tobacco program; I do support government (and private)efforts to discourage smoking.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
