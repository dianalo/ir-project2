The ruling stems from disputes over how the 1989 Sandamp;Lbailout law tightened Sandamp;L accounting rules. Previously, thegovernment permitted many Sandamp;Ls to use particularly lax rulesas an inducement to acquire failing institutions. Thoserules, written into many of the purchase contracts, werebanned under the bailout law. That ban was upheld in threeseparate federal appeals court decisions.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. Court of Claims ruling last week concedes thatthe government may repudiate the contract terms. However, itadds that Sandamp;Ls should be compensated for the loss from theaccounting change.   &quot;Abrogation of this right by the government . . . is abreach of contract entitling the plaintiffs to damages orrestitution,&quot; U.S. Claims Court Chief Judge Loren Smith saidin a preliminary order issued Friday.   The government's argument that it is exempt from thesesuits doesn't apply, he added. &quot;The sovereign acts doctrinedoes not bar plaintiffs' claims in this or analogous cases,&quot;he said. A more elaborate opinion is to be issued in thecoming month, he said.   &quot;I don't see how he could have worded it any moreclearly,&quot; said Charles Cooper, attorney for Winstar Corp.,the thrift-holding company that filed the claim.   A spokesman for the Justice Department said it will waitfor the judge's detailed opinion next month before decidingwhether to appeal.   Dozens of similar cases are pending, including some of theindustry's biggest Sandamp;Ls. Glenfed Inc., the $20 billion thriftin Glendale, Calif., for example, has a similar case pendingbefore Judge Smith, involving $750 million in net worth thatwas wiped out under the 1989 law.   &quot;We were not surprised by the decision,&quot; said JerryStouck, an attorney representing Glenfed. &quot;We've alwaysviewed it as a clear-cut breach-of-contract case.&quot;   Most of the dispute revolves around an accounting entrycalled good will. In the 1980s, thrift regulators permittedbuyers of the sick thrifts to count the negative net worth ofthe failing Sandamp;L as good will. To induce buyers to take on theailing institutions, the buyers were permitted to include thegood will as part of their net worth.   The change in good will accounting made the difference inwhether a thrift was seized by the government in dozens ofcases. Some attorneys theorized that their shareholders maybe entitled to compensation.   Some Sandamp;Ls, which pursued restitution in federal court andlost, are expected to try again in the Court of Claims. &quot;Thiswill encourage refilings of those claims,&quot; said DouglasFaucette, a Washington attorney who represented many of thosecompanies.   Even companies that haven't filed suit, he said, &quot;may feela fiduciary obligation to their stockholders,&quot; to pursuedamages if they are awarded to other thrifts.</TEXT></DOC>
