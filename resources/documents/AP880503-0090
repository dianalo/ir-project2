ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The chairman of the House space committeeproposed today that Congress and industry explore setting up atrust fund to finance future American ventures in space.   Such a fund, said Rep. Robert A. Roe, D-N.J., chairman of theHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee, would work like thehighway trust fund that financed the interstate highway system.   Roe also said that the NASA budget authorization bill, which asubcommittee will take up Wednesday, will for the first timeinclude a multiyear authorization.   ``It stands to reason that any good and reasonable plan musthave a duration of longer than a year,'' Roe told the AmericanInstitute of Aeronautics and Astronautics at its annual meeting innearby Alexandria, Va. ``We insisted on the absurdity of fundingour plans in one-year cycles.''   He said that had worked against rational planning because ``youcannot devise a long-term research and development program, hold atactical team together, and keep your facilities and equipment upto date if your primary concern is what next year's budget is goingto be.''   Roe said the subcommittee will authorize spending for theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration for fiscal 1989through fiscal 1991.   He said there was a great need for innovative space financingmethods.   ``How about developing a national space trust fund?'' he asked.``We have built and maintained our country's highway system ...through the highway trust fund.''   He said that NASA, which will probably get $10.5 billion to $11billion for the next fiscal year, needs at least $3 billion more.He said a national space development bond program could raise themoney.   ``Would the people of America buy bonds for their spaceprogram?'' he asked. ``I'm sure they will if somebody asks them.''   Roe said he may hold hearings to explore public and industryreaction to his suggestion.</TEXT></DOC>
