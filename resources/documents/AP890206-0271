Bush called for an increase in the insurance premium banks andsavings and loans pay on deposits and more money for the Departmentof Justice to pursue fraud in the thrift industry. The plan does notinclude a fee on depositors, but the increased cost of insurance fordeposits likely will be passed on to consumers in the form of lowerinterest rates on savings accounts.   ``We like the fact that it's not hitting the consumer directly,''said Sam Hart, a spokesman for First Gibraltar Bank FSB, the giantthrift recently formed through the consolidation of five Texassavings and loans.   Hart said First Gibraltar viewed Bush's plan as a move in a``positive direction,'' but added the company's officers were stilllooking it over.   First Gibraltar was formed in one of the largest consolidationsof the Southwest Plan, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's program tocleanse the thrift industry of its most troubled institutionsthrough a series of consolidations and recapitalizations.   At the FHLBB's Dallas office, a focal point for administration ofmuch of the Southwest Plan, spokesman David Colgren said, ``I reallycan't comment on the president's plan until we've had a chance tolook at it.''   San Antonio Savings' Cobler praised Bush's assurance thatdeposits in the nation's thrifts are safe.   ``We are pleased that he, very strongly at the beginning and endof the press conference, spoke of the full faith and credit ofgovernment behind thrifts,'' Cobler said.   Cobler said employees of his thrift in recent weeks have noted``a lot of confusion by the consumer.''   ``They don't necessarily know the full story about what'shappening to savings and loans,'' he said. ``They're concerned abouttaxes, they see headlines about failed institutions _ what we hearfrom our customer is that there's a lot of confusion out there.''</TEXT></DOC>
