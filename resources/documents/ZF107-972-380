 That may soon change, though, as Apple addshigher-performance models to its line and third parties like Radius bring outadd-ons that address some of the Mac's deficiencies (see related story atright).andM;&quot;CAD users want leading-edge performance,&quot; said Bruce Jenkins, vice presidentof Daratech Inc., a CAD/CAM/CAE market research firm in Cambridge, Mass.andO;&quot;These are people for whom Apple's strengths, like an easy-to-use interface,are not important draws.&quot;andM;&quot;Everyone agrees that the Mac needs better performance,&quot; said Kathey Hale,CAD market analyst at Dataquest, a market research firm in San Jose, Calif.andO;&quot;CAD will use up a 32-bit microprocessor.&quot;andM;Apple is quick to cite numbers from Dataquest to prove that it has alreadygained ground in the technical and scientific markets.andP;  According to themarket research company, Apple was second in units shipped in the 1988personal CAD hardware market, supplying about 35,000 of the more than 241,000units sold worldwide.andP;  Compaq ranked first with 48,000 units.andM;But other estimates paint a different picture.andP;  Studies from InternationalData Corp. of Framingham, Mass., show Mac software with a mere 5.7 percentshare of the microcomputer CAD market.andM;In terms of revenue share, Data-quest said, Apple's $132 million accountedfor 10.8 percent of the worldwide $1.22 billion personal CAD hardware market,placing it third behind Compaq and IBM.andM;The difference between Apple's high ranking in unit sales and its revenueshare can be attributed largely to the fact that most of the Mac CAD softwareon the market in 1988 addressed the low end by CAD standards and did notrequire the high-priced hardware many CAD professionals demand.andM;&quot;Our goal is not to target the 10 percent of heads-down CAD users who onlycare about speed and for whom ease of use and training aren't issues,&quot; saidDave Kulbarsh, marketing manager for Apple's Design and Drafting Group.andO;&quot;We're going after the 60 percent of technical users who use computers fordesign.andP;  Engineers don't do CAD; CAD is drafting.andP;  They want to do sketchingand drawing, not dimensioning.&quot;andM;Many people seem to agree with Apple's market positioning.andP;  &quot;There are twotypes of users,&quot; said Tomas Hernandez Jr., director of computer services atKohn Pedersen Fox Associates, a 210-person architecture firm in New York.andO;&quot;One does production work all day.andP;  Then there's the casual user like themanager, executive or job captain.andP;  And you can't put a $30,000 system in thehands of a casual user.andM;&quot;Besides,&quot; Hernandez said, &quot;the majority of the people who have CAD packageswon't get to the point in their lives where they use all the features of[Autodesk's] AutoCAD or MicroStation [from Intergraph].&quot;andM;But not all observers and players in the CAD market are convinced thatApple's strategy makes sense.andP;  Traditionally, they point out, it is preciselythe sophisticated users doing &quot;heads-down CAD&quot; who are the biggest spendersin the field.andM;According to industry observers, the question of whether the Mac will becomea larger force in CAD hinges on one issue: speed.andM;So far, the Mac has fallen short in this area.andP;  With the new 68030-basedMacs, however, overall system performance is &quot;more than adequate&quot; forcomputation tasks, according to Joel Orr, chairman of Orr Associates, part ofthe CAD/CAM Institute in Great Falls, Va.andP;  But raw power alone has not solvedthe problem.andM;&quot;The true technical obstacle for the Mac is its comparatively slow on-screenrepaint time when used with complex models that have floating-pointcoordinates,&quot; Orr said.andP;  &quot;That's the price Apple has paid for totaluniformity [with QuickDraw].&quot;andM;In Orr's view, Radius' new QuickCAD board, which addresses that issue byoffering display-list processing as a hardware adjunct, &quot;should help sellhigher-end Macs.andP;  It also will help attract vendors from other platforms thathave been put off by the Mac's redraw performance.&quot;andM;&quot;QuickCAD is already giving the Mac legitimacy as a serious CAD contender,&quot;said Bob Coan, president of U.S.andP;  CAD, one of the largest CAD value-addedresellers in Southern California.andP;  &quot;It makes the Mac perform as a Mac, and itgives AutoCAD a fighting chance.&quot; nandM;When Radius Inc. introduced its QuickCAD display-list accelerator, it set outto address an obstacle facing both vendors considering bringing their CADsoftware to the Mac and CAD users weighing a move to the Apple platform: theMac's slow screen redraw performance with vector-based CAD applications.andM;Sausalito, Calif.-based Auto-desk's AutoCAD, for example, is 30 times sloweron the Mac than on DOS platforms with display-list graphics processors.andM;The reason for the Mac's slowness is QuickDraw, the Apple imaging routinesthat control the Mac screen.andP;  QuickDraw contains no vector routinestraditionally used by vendors on other platforms to achieve the precisionneeded for CAD.andP;  And writing an application that provides precision yet takesadvantage of QuickDraw for fast redrawing is a difficult process.andO;MicroStation Mac from Hunts-ville, Ala.-based Intergraph and Claris CAD fromClaris Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif., are among the few CAD applications totake full advantage of QuickDraw.andM;Ironically, that fact prevents those products from deriving any benefit fromQuickCAD.andP;  But users of vector-based applications ported to the Mac, such asAutoCAD and VersaCAD from Versacad Corp. of Huntington Beach, Calif., mayfind that the Radius board easily justifies its $1,495 price tag.andM;&quot;Speed is crucial, and if it takes me five minutes for a redraw I'm out ofbusiness,&quot; said Michael Steele, vice president of CAD Solutions Inc., avalue-added reseller in San Jose, Calif.andP;  &quot;QuickCAD gives nearlyinstantaneous pan and zooms, and it will save literally hours a day of worktime.andP;  I am hoping QuickCAD will give the Mac a more equal footing [with DOSplatforms].&quot;andM;Some observers said better performance with AutoCAD could be a boon to Apple.andO;&quot;AutoCAD is the most popular CAD application, and an acceptably fast Macversion could truly help sell Macs,&quot; said Joel Orr, chairman of CADconsulting firm Orr Associates in Great Falls, Va.andP;  &quot;AutoCAD software hasacquired a degree of acceptability similar to that of IBM hardware.andP;  Peoplecan buy it without much argument.&quot;andM;QuickCAD is causing vendors to give the Mac a second look, according to MikeHara, product marketing manager for CAD products at Radius of San Jose,Calif.andP;  &quot;We heard from a lot of vendors that they would not port to the Macbecause of its lack of vector-based performance.andP;  But now vendors thatpreviously evaluated the Macintosh as limiting their products' performanceview QuickCAD as something that eliminates a barrier.andP;
