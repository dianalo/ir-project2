The Report and Accounts of British Coalfor 1985-86 noted that '27 collieries ceased production during the yearrepresenting an annual capacity of around 9 million tonnes'. It alsorecorded that productivity was 21.5 per cent above the(pre-strike) 1983-84level. This paper uses the operating results of the collieries to analysethe impact of this closure programme and other post-strike developmentson the pattern of productivity, costs and profits. Attention is confinedto 1985-86 in order to isolate as sharply as possible the immediate impactof the outcome of the dispute, which is generally recognized as one ofthe most important in recent times. Important changes have continuedwithin the industry and so a final balance sheet on the results of thestrike cannot yet be drawn up. 6 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
