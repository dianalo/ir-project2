Mrs. Sutherland has not courted publicity or criticized U.S.government officials to draw attention to the plight of herScots-born husband, Thomas Sutherland. Few recognized her at aprayer ceremony Wednesday to mark Terry Anderson's third year incaptivity.   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, is the longest-held American hostage. He and Sutherland havebeen held in the same room for some of the time, according toformer hostages.   Sutherland, dean of agriculture at the American University ofBeirut, was kidnapped June 9, 1985, arriving in Beirut after avisit to the United States. His wife was in Fort Collins, Colo., tofinish her Ph.D. thesis in English.   A soft-spoken but direct woman, Mrs. Sutherland returnedpermanently to Beirut in October 1985. Except for periodic visitsto see her three daughters, all in their 20s, she has remained inLebanon.   The State Department granted the wives of the American hostagesspecial permission to stay in Lebanon, which is off-limits to U.S.citizens. Mrs. Sutherland is one of the few Americans remaining inthe country.   Life in Beirut has settled into a routine for Mrs. Sutherland,who teaches English at the American University and lives on thecampus in West Beirut. Most of her time is spent working _ usuallyfrom 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.   Chaos in the country has forced many teachers to flee, leavingthe school short-staffed, Mrs. Sutherland said. Although herschedule is demanding, work gives meaning to her life and makes itbearable, she said.   ``Being at the university is so rewarding; there is so much todo,'' she said. She also created two funds to raise money for theuniversity and Lebanese children orphaned and handicapped by thewar.   ``She's really a saint,'' said Barbara Henry, a spokeswoman forthe university in New York.   While often too busy to leave the campus, Mrs. Sutherland saidshe travels around the city occasionally to shop and visit friends,especially the wives of the other hostages.   Security has improved since the Syrians stationed troops in WestBeirut about a year ago to quell the warring militias. ``In a sensethe lifestyle has changed quite remarkably and we have a sense ofliving quite normally.''   Murders, muggings and robberies are common _ as in any big city_ but indiscriminate shelling has virtually ceased, she said.   The challenge for Lebanon these days is the economy, which hastaken a beating as a result of the civil war. The electricity andthe water often shut off, and imported goods are sometimes in shortsupply, she said.   While so near to her husband, Mrs. Sutherland has had few cluesabout him or his captors. The hostages are thought to be held inthe southern suburbs of Beirut by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems closeto Iran.   Of the nine American hostages, six have wives living in Lebanon.Two _ Mrs. Sutherland and Virginia Steen _ were born in the UnitedStates; the others are from the Middle East.   The network of wives ``is a very strong support group,'' Mrs.Sutherland said, although she gets together on a frequent basisonly with Ilham Ghandour, Joseph Cicippio's wife. Cicippio was thecomptroller at the university.   The two live on the AUB campus, while three other women livenear the Beirut University College where their husbands taught.They are Mrs. Steen and the wives of Robert Polhill and JesseTurner. Also living in Lebanon is the wife of Frank H. Reed.   The wives pass along rumors and tips about the hostages, andcontact people they think might be helpful. But it is ``sort ofhard over so much time'' to stay in touch, she said.   One of Mrs. Sutherland's major concerns for her husband is thefrustration that he must feel by being unable to work or use histime constructively.   ``Tom was always a worker and not being able to do somethingmust be driving him crazy,'' she said.   Former hostages have said boredom was one of the worst parts ofcaptivity.   To amuse themselves, Sutherland and Anderson planned animaginary farm while in captivity, according to the Rev. LawrenceMartin Jenco, a former hostage who spent time with them.   Mrs. Sutherland lives in the present, refusing to look too farinto the future. Asked how long she expects her husband to remain ahostage, she replied: ``We don't know how many years it is going tobe.''   And when he is released, she will be there, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
