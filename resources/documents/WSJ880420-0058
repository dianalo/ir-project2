Food and medicine are fed through a catheter implanted permanently in your chest. Maybe your mother helps bathe and feed you, but often care comes from a team of surrogates -- doctors, nurses and social workers.    At age one, you walked, fed yourself and spoke a few words. But the passing months wobble your gait, steal your coordination, and garble and finally silence your words.    Infections, fevers and wasting assail your frame until death comes, perhaps as early as age two. The final blow may be something as simple and sudden as chicken pox. Or death's agent may be the encroaching dementia that turns toddlerhood back into infancy. Maybe death comes after a long, arduous battle with pneumonia.    Consider the cases of four children who suffer from the virus:   &quot;A&quot; (full names have been omitted to protect the children's privacy) doesn't see the Mylar balloon and the plush toy dog at the foot of his bed in the Jack Weiler Hospital unit of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. At age four, the sturdy, light-brown youngster has been reduced to a vegetative state by AIDS dementia. Oblivious to the television set that chatters above his head, his wide eyes stare at the wall, flicking now and then from side to side with involuntary jerks that the doctors say are a sign of neurological damage. He hasn't spoken in months.    &quot;They're sending him home soon,&quot; says Maadhava Ellaurie, an immunologist. &quot;There's not much we can do for him. The outlook is poor.&quot;    In nearby Newark, N.J., two-year-old &quot;D&quot; naps serenely in the pediatric ward of the Children's Hospital, a unit of the United Hospitals Medical Center. Her green gingham dress is immaculate, her room cheery and crammed with toys. Hospital Administrator Linda Antillon explains that this child is the ward's pet; the nurses buy her clothes and take them home to wash. Her mother makes rare appearances. &quot;I've personally seen her only once in nine months,&quot; Mrs. Antillon says.    When the child wakes, &quot;she scoots around in a walker, sings, finger paints. She's hysterical,&quot; Mrs. Antillon adds, eyes brimming. The girl says a few words, but her development is suspended at the level of a 10-month-old baby. She suffers malabsorption -- an inability to take in nutrients from food -- and must take supplemental feedings intravenously through the Broviac catheter imbedded in her chest. Nevertheless, a bedside menu lists macaroni and other foods. &quot;She needs to try to eat, to exercise her facial muscles, to help with speech,&quot; says Mrs. Antillon optimistically. As she sleeps, the little girl puckers her lips like a baby dreaming of the bottle.    In New York, on the 17th floor of Harlem Hospital, lies four-year-old &quot;C,&quot; awake but slumped dejectedly on her pillow, face to the wall. Elaine Abrams tiptoes up to the bedside and whispers, &quot;Hi, sweetie, want to talk?&quot; The girl shakes her head sadly and refuses to look her doctor in the eye.    &quot;Come closer,&quot; Dr. Abrams beckons a reporter. &quot;I want you to see how thin she is.&quot; She lifts the blanket, briefly exposing the girl's twiglike flanks, wrapped in Pampers. &quot;C&quot; weighs 22 pounds, as much as an average one year old. She has suffered from runaway herpes infections, fevers and wasting and can't tolerate food. Her mother is hospitalized three floors below with AIDS pneumonia. At home are four siblings in the care of an aged aunt. Still, says Dr. Abrams, the girl is &quot;depressed and wants to go home.&quot;    Harlem Hospital's longest child resident is &quot;J,&quot; a mute but animated three year old who has spent two years in residence. Another patient who contracted AIDS at or around birth, he suffers cardiac complications, clubbed fingers and a special kind of pneumonia that afflicts AIDS children. Called LIP (for lymphoid interstitial pneumonia), it is different from the adult variety, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which is caused by protozoa.    A bright-eyed mimic who quickly engages a visitor in a game of knocking down dominoes, &quot;J&quot; uses gestures to cue the hospital staff to his needs. Far from helpless, he can hook up his own nasogastric feeding tube and is &quot;quite bright&quot; in Dr. Abrams's view. But AIDS-related neurological damage has robbed him of speech and mobility. He can sit up but no longer walks.    Looking snappy in red suspenders and a &quot;Jesse Jackson for President&quot; button, &quot;J&quot; holds court in the playroom of the pediatric ward. One wall is decorated with his egg-crate &quot;spaceship&quot; and his first wobbly paintbrush strokes, dated and displayed by doting nurses. Asked about &quot;J's&quot; family, Dr. Abrams shrugs and says, &quot;He has a mother on every shift.&quot;    Persuading infected parents of infected children to come in for the testing and treatment they need is hard. Fear and suspicion, poverty, drug use and denial are formidable obstacles.    In Harlem Hospital's &quot;Pink Room&quot; -- named for the pink cards that identify child AIDS patients -- Dr. Abrams comes to check a baby girl playing in a walker. &quot;This little girl's parents admit they use crack but deny using needles and told me they are negative for the virus,&quot; Dr. Abrams says. &quot;I'm calling them in to be retested.&quot; Turning to the pink-pajama-clad baby, she singsongs sadly, &quot;I don't believe your daddy.&quot; The baby smiles. </TEXT></DOC>
