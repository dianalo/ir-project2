However, most of the decision trees candiagnose only a single disease. Often multiple diseases simultaneouslyexist in the patient with the same presenting symptom. For instance,a patient with cough as the presenting symptom can have pulmonary edemaand pneumococcal lobar pneumonia simultaneously or can have pulmonarytuberculosis and bronchogenic carcinoma. Moreover, these decision treesrequire reliable and one hundred percent accurate information. Sincethe patient's perception of the symptoms is often subjective, the decisiontrees could lead to ineffective and unreliable results. The authors aredeveloping computer aided diagnosis systems which check for matches betweenpatient's features (clues e.g. symptoms, signs, investigations) and featurevalues from the knowledge base for all the possible diseases that couldexist with the presenting symptom (e.g. cough).</TEXT></DOC>
