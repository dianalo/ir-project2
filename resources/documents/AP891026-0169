The convicts' crimes ranged from embezzlement to murder, and theofficial press has not confirmed in all cases that the executionshave been carried out. However, death sentences are rarelyoverturned on appeal.   A count of cases publicized in national newspapers found 74since Aug. 15, when the government began a new anti-corruptioncampaign. Many more cases are reported only in local newspapers andsome are never reported, so the actual total may be much higher.   The official Xinhua News Agency said the factory worker, JianJianguo, 30, was sentenced and immediately executed in Beijing. Itsaid he evaded customs tariffs of more than $251,480 by forgingdocuments and official seals together with customs officers.   He also made $148,090 in illegal profit by selling goods hebought illegally in duty-free shops, Xinhua said.   A second man who was convicted of embezzling $106,355 wassentenced to death but then given a two-year reprieve, with thechance for commutation to life in jail, because he confessed.   The two cases clearly were publicized to encourage more peopleto turn themselves in for economic crimes in the last five days ofa 10-week leniency period.   The government said Aug. 15 that anyone turning himself inbefore Oct. 31 for embezzlement, bribery and other economic crimeswould be treated less severely, while those _ like Jian _ who didnot would be sentenced harshly.   By mid-October, more than 13,600 people nationwide had taken upthe offer. Many cities, including Beijing, have held publicmeetings to parade the offenders.   Not all of the 74 death sentences publicized since Aug. 15 werefor economic crimes.   Five men were sentenced for holding up train passengers atknife-point; two men for trafficking in the skins of rare giantpandas; two men for abducting and selling mentally retarded womenas wives; and several for murder or theft.   Chinese law gives judges wide discretion in sentencing, and thedeath sentence can be given for almost any crime if thecircumstances are judged serious. The Supreme Court occasionallyhands down instructions to judges nationwide to treat certainclasses of criminals harshly, as in the Aug. 15 ultimatum and in aJune notice calling for severity in sentencing participants in thespring democracy movement.   There have been no new announcements of executions ofprotesters. Twelve such cases were announced in the first weeksafter the army crushed the protests in June.   Executions in China occur with a bullet to the back of the head.</TEXT></DOC>
