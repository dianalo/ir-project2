The unions, seeking to overturn a controversial labor law, alsotold their 1.5 million members to refuse to work overtime for thenext four weeks.   Union leaders said the action could cut industrial production by20 percent or force white employers to hire thousands of additionalblack workers.   A coalition of anti-apartheid women's groups said they wouldproceed with a major march Saturday on government headquarters inPretoria despite a ban.   The government, for the first time in decades, has allowedseveral protest marches this month, but the women's march was bannedbecause its leaders refused to seek permission.   Laura Pollecutt, one of the march organizers, said her colleagueshad notified authorities of the planned route but did not feel theirright to protest was subject to government approval.   In Durban, South Africa's largest port and third-largest city, anestimated 15,000 people of all races, including members of the whitecity council, joined a peaceful anti-government march to City Hallthis afternoon.   About 10,000 protesters led by the Rev. Allan Boesak, presidentof the World Alliance, staged a similar march in Oudtshoorn, a townof 40,000 people in southern Cape Province. It was by far thelargest protest ever in Oudtshoorn, center of the ostrich-farmingindustry and the scene of frequent confrontations between police andactivists.   After a 5.5-mile march, the protesters presented police with alist of demands, including a halt to alleged harassment of activistsand the arrest of vandals who desecrated tombs of three youthskilled by police during unrest in 1985.   Durban and Oudtshoorn police kept a low profile, in accordancewith the government's 10-day-old policy of permitting some politicalprotests. But Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee filed court paperstoday seeking to ban the women's march.   The union protests were intended to pressure employers intorenouncing a new labor law which unions say undermines their abilityto strike. Union leaders urged all blacks to join the consumerboycott, which they said was part of a broad-based national defiancecampaign that began in early August.   There was no immediate word from retail organizations about theextent of the consumer boycott, which is intended to continuethrough Oct. 6. But department stores in the eastern Cape Provincecities of East London and King William's Town, where the boycottbegan early, were reported virtually deserted on Thursday.   The defiance campaign has included protests of segregation laws,as well as mass marches in cities across the country, the first suchdemonstrations allowed by the government for decades.   All the recent marches had been peaceful until Thursday, whensome black youths smashed windows of shops and vehicles as marchersdispersed in Pietermaritzburg, capital of Natal Province. No arrestsor injuries were reported, but pro-government media gave headlinetreatment to the incident.   Magistrates in several cities issued warnings today thatorganizers of protest marches must request permission at least sevendays in advance. Leaders of most of the recent marches have refusedto apply for a permit.   Several prominent activists have been detained during thedefiance campaign, including white Cape Town lawyer Willie Hofmeyr.His father said today that Hofmeyr has ended a 28-day hunger strikeand indicated that Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok wasconsidering releasing the activist.   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, the largest blacklabor federation, said no violence or coercion should be used toenforce the consumer boycott. The 1-million-member congress saidblack shopkeepers should avoid raising their prices during theboycott.   The boycott also is endorsed by the National Congress of TradeUnions, which claims 500,000 members.   The target of the union protests is the Labor Relations AmendmentAct, enacted by the government last year despite strenuousobjections from black unions. Some of its original, hard-lineprovisions were modified, but unions still object to sections whichprohibit sympathy strikes, restrict the frequency of strikes againstany particular company, and make it easier for unions to be heldliable for strike-related losses.</TEXT></DOC>
