In the past week, prices of thousands of little OTC stocks jumped, rumors swirled, and buyers scooped up issues with an enthusiasm that traders said they haven't seen since early 1985. Securities analysts, whose reports on OTC issues the past few years have been almost ignored, found investors hungry for information and recommendations.    Prices of Nasdaq's industrial issues climbed nearly 4% last week, compared with less than a 2% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow Jones industrials had one good day last week, but the OTC market had five. While the Big Board was slipping again Friday, the Nasdaq industrial index climbed 1.95 to 382.82. Of the 141.2 million shares that traded on Nasdaq Friday, 62.3 million rose in price, and less than half that many, 29.1 million, fell.    Many of the week's biggest gainers weren't takeover candidates and didn't announce breathtaking earnings increases. In fact, many made no announcements at all. It was a market driven by investor demand.    Typical of the new climate was last week's biggest Nasdaq gainer, Howtek, which jumped $7 a share on the week, or 57%, to $19.25.    Howtek, a Hudson, N.H.-based developer of a jet printer and scanner that attach to a computer, isn't even traded on Nasdaq's National Market System; it's quoted on a Nasdaq additional list.    A week ago, Howtek was selling at its year-end 1987 price of $12.25 a share. Then the rumors started.    Some portfolio managers said they heard the company was planning to unveil, at a conference in Denver this Thursday, a computer-connected four-color printer with photograph-like reproduction. Others heard that Dean Witter Reynolds had put out a major favorable report on the company. By Wednesday, the stock was rising on 10 times its usual 7,000-share-a-day volume.    Robert Howard, Howtek's chairman, said Friday that he has no plans to unveil anything in Denver this week. He said the only new development currently in sight is an eventual, and still undetermined, combination of the company's existing scanner and the four-color printer it began to deliver in the past few months.    &quot;Sales should reach $2 million in the current quarter as a result of sales of the new printer,&quot; he said. &quot;But we've disclosed that before.&quot;    Meanwhile, Friday morning, Dean Witter did send out a buy recommendation on its internal wire for the stock. Willard Brown, Dean Witter's special situations analyst, said he has prepared a report on Howtek. But he said it won't be back from the printers and distributed until Wednesday.    Mr. Brown said Friday that because of the rise in Howtek's stock Wednesday and Thursday, &quot;We decided we had to put something out on the wire this morning; we didn't know if there was a leak.&quot; Howtek rose 4 3/4 Friday, more than doubling its gain for the first four days of the week.    Howtek wasn't unique last week. By Thursday, Cambridge Bioscience, a Worcester, Mass.-based concern that is working on an inexpensive test for the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus, had climbed 7/8 to 9 3/4. On Friday, Teena Lerner, a Shearson Lehman Hutton biotechnology analyst, said she had upgraded her recommendation on the stock.    Earlier in the week, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report, she attended a meeting sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration at which favorable data on the AIDS virus test were reviewed. On Friday, Cambridge jumped 2 7/8 to 12 3/4 on 1.2 million shares, giving it a 36% gain for the week.    Small OTC issues that climbed last week without benefit of any news or announcements included dozens of technology stocks. Gateway Communications rose 1 1/4 to 3 7/8, Valid Logic Systems gained 1 to 4 3/8, Crop Genetic International leaped 2 3/4 to 9 3/4, Life Technologies advanced 3 3/4 to 16 1/2, and Pyramid Technology was up 2 to 10 1/2.    Gateway makes networking and communications peripherals for IBM-compatible computers, and the tiny company's earnings have been falling even as its revenue rose. Valid Logic makes computer-aided work stations for electronic design engineers, and it recently turned profitable.    Crop Genetic uses biotechnology to develop crop-improving products. Its sales of disease-free sugar cane seed are rising. Life Technologies makes products used by other companies to carry out genetic research. It has rising sales and earnings. Pyramid Technology makes minicomputers that are linked in networks to mainframes. Its earnings are rising because of growing sales to regional Bell telephone companies. </TEXT></DOC>
