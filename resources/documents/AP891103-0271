The surprising economic strength to begin the fourth quarter _which came despite the seventh consecutive monthly decline inmanufacturing _ was largely attributed to continued localgovernment hiring for the school year.   Automobile manufacturing led the overall decline in theindustrial sector.   Analysts interpreted the data as proof no recession would comethis year although some said the economy would flirt with one earlynext year if the manufacturing slump spills over into relatedservices industries.   And they said the unexpected job growth and fresh evidence ofpersistent wage inflation would keep the Federal Reserveimmediately from easing its hold on credit, which in turn wouldhave triggered lower interest rates for consumers.   The Labor Department said average hourly earnings rose 0.7percent in October. Most analysts had anticipated job-growth ofabout 150,000 and a 0.4 percent boost in hourly earnings.   ``The Fed will be in a no-change stance at least until the nextunemployment report,'' said Allen Sinai of Boston Co. EconomicAdvisers. Others said it might relax its hold on credit when itspolicy-makers meet next week, when the government will have issuednew inflation data.   ``The economy is clearly slowing down but once again there's norecession in these numbers,'' said Micheal Evans, head of aWashington forecasting firm. ``There is, however, continued sign ofaccelerating wages and the Fed is worried about that, so theycouldn't possibly ease as a result of this report.''   Initial reaction in financial markets to thestronger-than-expected report was muted; both the stock and bondmarkets were little changed.   The civilian unemployment rate remained at 5.3 percent as thecivilian labor force grew by 65,000 Americans last month to 124million and the number of them who had jobs rose to 117.5 million.   Virtually all of the growth came in services.   Local governments added 96,000 jobs, most of which the LaborDepartment said were school-related, and state governments added10,000 more.   The booming health-services sector grew by 33,000 jobs lastmonth, while employment in business services, finance and realestate was up slightly or flat.   Retail trade added 24,000 jobs, transportation and publicutilities 27,000 and wholesale trade 6,000.   The goods-producing sector reported an overall drop of 3,000jobs, a decline that would have been worse had not modest gains inmining and construction offset the 13,000 drop in manufacturingemployment. That followed a revised drop of 88,000 factory jobs inSeptember.   The durable-goods sector of manufacturing has lost more than150,000 jobs in the last five months.   Layoffs in automobile manufacturing, which lost 14,000 jobs lastmonth and 29,000 in September, are fueling the decline. Thatsector's slump appears likely to continue; Chrysler announced majorlayoffs Friday.   Underscoring manufacturing's weakness, the department said theaverage factory workweek fell from 41.1 hours to 40.8 hours andovertime was virtually non-existent after averaging just under fourhours a week for several months.   The department said some of that decline was because of theMachinists strike against Boeing Corp.   ``We have a two-headed economy,'' said Sinai. ``Manufacturing isin a recession but the service side is OK so the overall economycan keep growing, so long as the service strength holds up.''   The department said unemployment rates among major demographicgroups were:   _Adult white men, 4.5 percent, down from 4.8 percent inSeptember.   _Adult white women, 4.7 percent, up from 4.5 percent.   _Black adult men, 10.3 percent, up from 10 percent.   _Black adult women, 10 percent, up from 9.6 percent.   _Hispanics, 7.9 percent, down from 8.3 percent.   _All teen-agers, 14.9 percent, down from 15.1 percent.   _Black teens, 34.2 percent, down from 37.3 percent.   A separate calculation of unemployment that includes members ofthe armed services stationed in the United States was alsounchanged, at 5.2 percent.   The Labor Department uses a monthly survey of businesses todetermine the payroll numbers while the unemployment rate is takenfrom a separate household survey. The two surveys often giveconflicting data on employment growth and Friday the departmentsaid it had confirmed its suspicion that the discrepancy occursbecause more Americans are holding two or more jobs.   ``Most dual jobholders appear on two or more payrolls in thebusiness survey but are counted only once in the householdsurvey,'' Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet Norwood toldCongress. ``With demand for labor strengthening in recent years,increasing numbers of workers have taken on second jobs.''</TEXT></DOC>
