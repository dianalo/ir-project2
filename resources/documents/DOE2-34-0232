Nominal startingcompositions with cation ratios of 1:1:1:2 and 2:2:1:2 show considerablydifferent superconducting behavior. In both cases multiphase materialsare formed. The predominant superconducting phase occurs as thin plateletswith an orthorhombic, modulated structure. These particles often haveedges aligned along [110], [100], and [010] directions and contain subgrainboundaries. Electron diffraction patterns and high-resolution micrographstaken along several zone axes are consistent with an incommensurate centeredmodulation along the b axis with a magnitude of 4.7 +- 0.1 times b. Unexpectedly,two distinct chemical compositions were found in platelets with the sameapparent structure: Bi{sub 4}Sr{sub 3}Ca{sub 3}Cu{sub 4}O/sub 16//sub+- //sub {delta}/ for the lower T/sub c/ phase in the 1:1:1:2 material,and Bi{sub 2}Sr{sub 2}CaCu{sub 2}O{sub 8}/sub +- //sub {delta}/ for theisomorphic higher T/sub c/ phase present in the 2:2:1:2 samples.</TEXT></DOC>
