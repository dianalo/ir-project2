Read on...andM;Fortunately, Diane, I survived my encounter in the hotel last issue thanks tosome real intelligence and a builet-proof vest.andP;  Since our last conversationI've unearthed a whole new series of expert-system applications in some veryunusual business areas.andM;&quot;The first is a system for saving the part of the Dutch mushroom crop that islost annually to a disease called bacterial blotch.andP;  About 5%-15% of thecountry's $100 million mushroom crop is destroyed by this disease, whichresults from climate-control variations or cultivation errors.andP;  Because nocure for the disease exists, an experimental station in Holland beganinvestigating ways to improve monitoring of the mushroom-production equipmentand conduct cultivation and climate-control procedures more accurately.andM;&quot;The mushroom group chose Software Aandamp;E's Knowledge Engineering System (KES)running on a 386-based PC as a development environment.andP;  It runs under OS/2and contains three knowledge bases that address critical functions of theequipment used for mushroom growing.andP;  The system attempts to identify anyvariances in equipment functions that might result in exposure to the dreadedbacterial blotch, which shows up on the mushrooms as dark spots around thecap.andM;&quot;This Software Aandamp;E outfit keeps showing up in AI applications, but itoperates outside of the mainstream of other AI companies.andP;  I found another oftheir applications over in Holland-remind me to mention this little Europeanexcursion on my next expense report - used by a retail firm known as HEMAb.v.andP;  HEMA has approximately 200 department stores that sell variousproducts, but in this case, the focus is paint.andP;  Yes Diane, paint.andM;&quot;The company created a PC-based system in KES called Paint Advisor that givescustomers a point-of-purchase opportunity to get help with their paint needs.andO;The system performs three basic functions: it gives essential advice on howto do a proper paint job, with recommendations for tools, products, andestimating costs; it performs an evaluation of products the user selects fora specific job; and it displays all the relevant information about theproducts discussed during the session.andP;  The customer then gets a completeprintout of the recommendations.andP;  The entire system runs under XENIX onspecial in-store terminals that have only 12 keys for a user interface.andP;  Theentire Paint Advisor application contains 280 rules and cost approximately$150,000-$200,000 to complete.andP;  The store hopes to get a return on itsinvestment through increased paint and tool sales.andM;&quot;KES is also used by the Trustee Savings Bank Group of England to trainemployees on products offered by the bank, such as debit cards.andP;  TSB used tolose a day for each employee when they took time off from work to learn thedetails of new products.andP;  But using KES under UNIX on Hewlett-Packardworkstations, the company can train an employee in two hours at a cost of twoor three dollars.andP;  The training system uses knowledge culled from marketingand training experts and is now used each time the bank offers a newfinancial product to clients.andP;  TSB expects to train all 25,000 of itspersonnel in 1,250 branches within a month.andM;&quot;The bank has also created a program called the Expatriate Advisor, whichadvised expatriated British citizens on foreign and domestic tax laws.andP;  Usingthe system, TSB claims to have been able to increase expatriate accounts 20%.andM;&quot;Software Aandamp;E's prime customer base seems to be the federal government,Diane, which is perhaps the most patriotic endeavor any company can aspireto.andP;  The company is working with the U.S.andP;  Army Engineer TopographicLaboratories to encode the knowledge of terrain analysts.andP;  These people lookat aerial photographs and identify the landforms for classification.andP;  Theclassification is then used by military analysts and strategists to determinemilitary movements and procedures.andP;  The KES system, running on differentworkstations, is used basically for two purposes: to capture domain-specificknowledge for relating identifiable features on the photographs to specificlandforms and to provide the military with a decision-making tool.andM;&quot;For instance, looking at a set of hills or alluvial fans (that's geologicaljargon, Diane) in an aerial photograph, an analyst can make some basicassumptions as to where troop movements should be conducted.andP;  Two closely sethills create a bottleneck, impeding the movement of tanks and foot troops.andO;Alluvial fans can conceal tanks in their gullies, but not if they run againstthe desired direction of the tanks.andP;  Certain kinds of landforms create uniquesituations in adverse weather conditions; some become dusty and impedehelicopter movement, others become muddy and marsh-like and restrictground-based operations.andP;  These factors are entered into the KES system,which is finishing its prototype phase.andM;&quot;Back on business turf in New York City, Dun andamp; Bradstreet, the informationconglomerate that manages a lot of America's data, has created a creditanalysis expert system for the apparel industry.andP;  Dandamp;B's Credit Clearing House(CCH) provides information to apparel manufacturers, wholesales, anddistributors about the creditworthiness of apparel retailers.andP;  The company isusing the Los Angeles-based Inference Corp.'s ARTIM to advise customers aboutthe type of credit that should be extended to their retailers.andM;&quot;The credit expert was created on PCs and then ported to two DEC microVAXes,which in turn act as external coprocessors to an IBM 3090.andP;  The IBM mainframecontains essential credit data used for analysis by the expert system.andP;  Whena credit request is entered into the system after a query from a CCH client,information is accessed from within the mainframe, then processed anddelivered back to the operator within 10 seconds.andP;  This process once requiredthree days of data sorting to make a decision and now requires only moments.andM;&quot;The C-based expert system contains more than 800 rules and allegedly makesthe decision on creditworthiness in less than half a second.andP;  Boy, Diane, ifthey could only get someone to be able to make good coffee that fast.andM;&quot;Diane, I didn't have enough time to do in-depth research on a couple ofunique applications being developed by Georgia Tech, so a cursory explanationwill have to do.andP;  The first is Julia, a kind of superior Wine Advisor thatrecommends dinner menus and combinations from a database.andP;  Over time, thesystem learns the idiosyncracies, likes, and dislikes of the user, (`Neverserve after dinner mints with Mexican food,' for example) gleaned fromfeedback after each meal.andP;  The system is somewhat self-modifying in thatrespect.andP;  Georgia Tech is also developing SuperMom, an activity planner thatschedules the events of a working mother's day-from meetings and appointmentsto laundry, cleaning, and addressing the kids' needs.andM;&quot;Well, Diane, I'm finished with this case.andP;  I can already see the TV spinoffas a continuing prime time soap opera covering the bizarre workings of AItechnology.andP;  Instead of the Pacific Northwest, we can have the setting inCambridge, Mass.andP;  Or maybe Stanford, Calif.andP;  We'll get all the actors fromthe old  Mod Squad' series to investigate new applications.andP;  Thepossibilities are endless, because AI is finally getting some decentcommercial acceptance.andP;  See you on prime time, Diane.&quot;andM;Harvey P. Newquist III is CEO of The Relayer Group, which publishes the AITRENDS newsletter.andP;  He lives in Scottsdale, Ariz.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
