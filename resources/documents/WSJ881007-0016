Bond trading has been exceptionally light all week because of nervousness about the Labor Department's employment report for September. As of late yesterday, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bonds were yielding 8.95%, which is exactly where it was late Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.    &quot;Everyone is waiting for the {labor} numbers,&quot; said Scott E. Pardee, vice chairman of Yamaichi International (America) Inc. &quot;People spent most of the day squaring their positions because they don't want to bet on what the number will be.&quot;    &quot;There was more interest and discussion in the Quayle-Bentsen face-off Wednesday night than there was in today's bond market,&quot; said Marshall B. Front, executive vice president at Stein Roe andamp; Farnham Inc., a large Chicago-based investment counseling firm. &quot;The stock market had a similar reaction. It went nowhere. Things are on hold in all the financial markets.&quot;    The September employment data will be studied intently for signs of whether the economy's apparent slowdown in August represented a trend or just a one-month fluke. If signs of slower growth do emerge, that would reduce inflation fears and lead to sharply lower interest rates, investment managers say.    But that's not what most analysts expect the report to show.    In several recent surveys, analysts said the figures probably will show the civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.5% from 5.6% in August. They also expect strong employment gains. For example, the average estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report calls for an increase of 291,000 in the number of workers on non-farm payrolls last month. That would compare with a 219,000 increase in August.    &quot;I think the numbers will indicate a fairly robust economy&quot; and lead to slightly higher interest rates in the next few weeks, said Mr. Front of Stein Roe. However, he expects rates to decline after that. Mr. Front said an increase in business payrolls of 300,000 or more would be viewed as economic strength that would arouse speculation that the Federal Reserve Board will tighten credit further.    Bonds held steady even though most short-term interest rates climbed. For example, the rate on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.31% bid from 7.22% Wednesday.    Traders ignored the Fed's latest money-supply report late yesterday, showing large declines in two money measures. Some dealers say sluggish money growth recently could be a sign that economic growth is slowing and that the Fed won't tighten credit further. But they quickly add that they are unwilling to bet on it ahead of the employment report.    The report is especially influential because the figures are highly volatile from month to month and exceptionally tough to forecast. &quot;If it could be well-predicted, it wouldn't have the impact that it does,&quot; said Robert Dederick, executive vice president at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.    Treasury Securities   The government's benchmark 30-year bonds were quoted late yesterday at a price of 101 26/32, the same as late Wednesday.    The latest 10-year Treasury notes rose 1/32 of a point to 102 19/32, reversing their slight decline Wednesday. The yield remained unchanged at about 8.85%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 0.89 point to 1250.22. It ranged between 1246.18 and 1250.56.    The Treasury's new two-year notes yielded 8.40%, unchanged from Wednesday. Its four-year notes yielded 8.55%, down slightly from 8.56%. And the seven-year notes to be issued Wednesday were quoted in when-issued trading at 8.75%, unchanged.    Among short-term rates, the rate on new six-month Treasury bills rose slightly to 7.53% bid from 7.49% Wednesday.    Municipals   Municipal bonds were little changed again.    With the tax-exempt market having seen robust price gains in recent sessions, some traders say the market is vulnerable to a slump if investors conclude from the employment data that the economy is accelerating. Even if the report shows moderate growth, some traders say municipal bond prices may not advance much further.    The bonds of the Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Co. were little changed after the power supply agency's board voted Wednesday to petition the Vermont Supreme Court to reconsider a recent decision.    The high court last month invalidated power sales agreements between Massachusetts Municipal and certain Vermont municipalities that together have a less than 1% share in the Seabrook nuclear project.    &quot;There was no reaction&quot; in the market to the Massachusetts Municipal decision, according to one trader, noting that the move &quot;was anticipated.&quot;    Massachusetts Municipal's 8 3/4% issue of 2018, one of the more closely followed of the issuer's bonds, were at 97 bid late yesterday, unchanged.    As a result of the recent Vermont court ruling, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. lowered its evaluation of Massachusetts Municipal's bonds, shifting its rating for $1.47 billion of senior debt to on CreditWatch with negative implications from on CreditWatch with developing implications.    The rating agency said at that time that the court decision raised the question of &quot;whether the release of the Vermont participants may have an effect on the remaining power sales agreements&quot; that form security for Massachusetts Municipal bonds.    Separately, Northern Trust Co. will close the New York arm of its municipal bond operations Oct. 15, according to an official of the Chicago-based bank. The move is the result of &quot;a sharp decline in the volume of general obligation municipal bond underwriting opportunities,&quot; said Perry Pero, Northern Trust's chief financial officer and executive vice president, capital markets.    Four professionals and one secretary will be affected by the action. The bank is &quot;currently reviewing their options,&quot; Mr. Pero said of the personnel.    Interest Rate Futures   Expectations are widespread that short-term interest rates will surge temporarily around year end, as they frequently have in the past.    Those expectations are continuing to emerge in the short-term interest rate futures market, traders said.    The rate on federal funds, or reserves banks lend each other overnight, usually soars at the end of December as banks scramble for funds to spruce up their balance sheets for presentation to shareholders. For example, this phenomenon, known as &quot;window-dressing,&quot; drove up the funds rate to 38% at one point on the final day of 1986. The rate on funds has averaged between about 8% and 8 1/4% recently.    &quot;In the last few years, you have had a very tight federal funds market with year-end pressures,&quot; said Norman Frey, financial futures analyst at Northern Futures Corp. &quot;What is happening right now is that the {futures} market is reflecting that.&quot;    December Eurodollar futures settled yesterday at 91.21, while March Eurodollar futures settled at 91.31. Typically, front-month futures contracts trade at a premium to deferred-month contracts.    If the funds rate rises as expected in late December, other short-term interest rates typically would be pulled higher, analysts say.    Thus, expectations of a higher federal funds rate at year end &quot;will also be reflected in a longer three-month rate that includes that time period, such as December Eurodollar futures,&quot; said Lawrence Morgan, a vice president in the futures and options division in Chicago of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Expectations of higher short-term rates mean lower prices for futures based on those instruments.    Mr. Frey said the current differential between the December and March contracts reflects expectations that the funds rate will trade at about 13% for the last four to five days of the year. The spread of the March contract above December delivery might widen further if market participants begin to expect an even higher year-end funds rate, Mr. Frey added.    Last year, the funds rate didn't rise as sharply at the end of the year as traders had expected. That was partly because many banks didn't wait until the last moment to purchase federal funds.    Corporate Issues   Corporate bond prices finished little changed in light trading.    Underwriters gave their first indication as to the levels they hope to sell Federated Department Stores Inc.'s $1.15 billion of junk bonds.    Price talk for the $300 million of noncallable senior subordinated notes due 1994 is for a yield in the area of 13 1/2% to 13 3/4%. The $300 million of senior subordinated extendible reset notes are expected to be priced between 13% and 13 1/4%, and the $550 million of senior subordinated debentures due 2000 are expected to be priced with a yield of about 14 1/2%.    The debt is expected to be priced in about 10 days to two weeks, officials said.    The portion of the price talk that raised some eyebrows on Wall Street is the 14 1/2% talk on the 12-year senior subordinated debentures.    Some dealers argue that such a yield doesn't fully compensate investors. For comparison, traders look at the paper of Allied Stores Corp., a sister company of Federated. Both are units of Campeau Corp.    The Allied 11 1/2% issue of 1997 was quoted late yesterday at 15.50%, a yield that is 100 basis points greater than the price talk on the Federated 12-year issue.    The senior subordinated debentures of Allied and Federated are rated single-B-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc.    Some officials connected with the Federated offering argue that the Allied issue is oversold and has in fact rallied this week from a yield of about 15.80% late last week.    This Allied debt issue sank last month after the company disclosed that it had a loss of $107 million for the second quarter ended July 30.    Dealers also said there has been some weakness in the Allied issue, which totals $700 million in size, caused by the pending flood of Federated paper.    &quot;Some people are looking to get out of the Allied paper and into Federated. That creates downward price pressure on the Allied paper,&quot; another dealer argued.    Mortgage-Backed Securities   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage issues were mostly unchanged in light trading.    Ginnie Mae 9% securities for October delivery were quoted at 95 2/32 bid, unchanged; 10% securities were at 100 18/32 bid, unchanged; and Freddie Mac 10% securities were at 100 bid, also flat.    The Ginnie Mae 10% issue was yielding 10.04% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the 10-year Treasury note narrowed one basis point to 119.    Foreign Bonds   British government bonds rose again, helped by speculation that the pound will strengthen further.    In Tokyo, Japanese government bond prices drifted slightly lower in light activity. And in West Germany, bond trading also was quiet, with West German government issues winding up little changed from late Wednesday.    In London, British government bonds, known as gilts, advanced about half a point. Dealers cited large purchases by U.S. and European investors. Mark Odescalchi, a director of James Capel Gilts, said there has been considerable buying by North American investors over the last few days. &quot;Americans are keen on the pound,&quot; he said.    Other market sources also reported buying by European as well as by Far East investors. &quot;Some of it was a little bit panicky,&quot; said John Mullet, a director of Shearson Lehman Gilts. &quot;People are wary and nervous of going against the current {trend}.&quot;    Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007 ended 15/32 of a point higher at 116 18/32 to yield 9.59%. Shorter-term bonds posted smaller gains. The government's 11 3/4% issue due 1991 climbed 3/32 to 103 to yield 10.19%, while the 12% issue due 1995 was up 8/32 to 108 15/32 to yield 10.13% late Wednesday.    Japanese government bonds hovered in a narrow range most of the day. The government's benchmark No. 105 5% issue due 1997 closed at a price of 100.09, down 0.16 yen per 100 yen face value. The yield rose to 4.985% from 4.96%. The range on the session was 4.95% to 4.985%.    Some Japanese analysts remain bullish on bonds amid speculation that the Bank of Japan won't tighten credit further and may even ease its grip. The central bank's policy stance &quot;is definitely not toward tightening. Rather, it's leaning slightly toward the easing side,&quot; said Johsen Takahashi, research director of Mitsubishi Research Institute.    Nevertheless, traders spent much of yesterday squaring their positions. Many remain on the sidelines ahead of the U.S. employment figures and as the nation awaits further word on Emperor Hirohito's health. The Emperor's health apparently is worsening, and his death could result in the financial markets being closed for an undetermined period. The U.S. employment figures will be released after the close of Tokyo trading today, followed by a three-day weekend in Japan, where markets will be closed Monday for a national holiday.    In West Germany, the West German government's benchmark 6 3/4% issue due 1998 traded late in the day at 101.35 to yield 6.556%, unchanged from late Wednesday. </TEXT></DOC>
