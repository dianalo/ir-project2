Two-dimensional grammartechniques serve the purpose of exploiting the structure or underlyingrelationships in a picture. This approach attempts to describe a complexpicture in terms of their components and their relative positions. Thisresembles the way a sentence is described in terms of its words and phrases,and the terms structural picture recognition, linguistic picture recognition,or syntactic picture recognition are often used. By using this approach,the problem of picture recognition becomes similar to that of phraserecognition in a language. However, describing pictures using a stringgrammar (one-dimensional grammar), the only relation between sub-picturesand/or primitives is the concatenation; that is each picture or primitivecan be connected only at the left or right. This one-dimensional relationhas not been very effective in describing two-dimensional pictures. Anatural generalization is to use two-dimensional grammars. In this paper,two-dimensional grammars and their applications to artificial intelligenceare presented.</TEXT></DOC>
