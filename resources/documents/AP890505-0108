It's just thathe didn't keep it,'' Gerald Lefcourt said Thursday.   Hoffman, 52, who committed suicide April 12 in his apartmentnear New Hope, named Johanna Lawrenson as sole beneficiary in hiswill, which was filed Wednesday in Bucks County.   Ms. Lawrenson and Hoffman had lived together for several years.   The 1983 will was accompanied by a death certificate listing hisfull name as Abbott Howard Hoffman and his self-describedoccupation as ``Jewish Road Warrior.''   He left instructions in the will for Ms. Lawrenson to choose afinal resting place for his ashes and said disposal ``shall be asinexpensive as possible.''   Hoffman had several hundred dollars in the bank, a smallretirement account and personal effects of an undetermined value,Lefcourt said. A $10,000 bank loan was covered by an insurancepolicy.   The $2,000 figure ``is just an approximate value of hisestate,'' Lefcourt said. ``I'm not sure if it's realistic.''   Hoffman gave away ``hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybemillions'' he had earned through his books, magazine articles andspeaking engagements, Lefcourt said.   In 1970, Hoffman received a check for about $40,000 afternegotiating a movie contract for his book, ``Revolution for theHell of it,'' and immediately signed the check over to the BlackPanther bail fund, Lefcourt said. ``It didn't even go through hisaccount.''</TEXT></DOC>
