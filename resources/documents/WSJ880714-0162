The news agency said the failure apparently was caused by malfunction of the rocket's first-stage motor.    Press Trust of India reported an abnormality shortly after the rocket, the &quot;Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle,&quot; blasted off from Sriharikota Island, about 1,100 miles southeast of New Delhi.    The United News of India said the control center for the launch first lost contact with the five-stage vehicle about three minutes after lift-off. The report said a signal from the satellite, scheduled for 12 minutes after takeoff, wasn't received.    M.C. Kapila, an official with Indian Space Research Organization in New Delhi, said scientists hadn't located the rocket, which was believed to have crashed into the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean.    The chairman of the research organization, U.R. Rao, was quoted as saying the cause of the launch failure hadn't been determined.    The rocket carried a 330-pound satellite designed to photograph Earth and conduct experiments. The satellite was to enter an orbit about 240 miles above Earth, scientists said.    This was the second launch failure for India in 15 months. Another rocket from the same series plunged into the Bay of Bengal in March 1987, when its first-stage motor also failed to ignite, minutes after launching.    India last successfully launched a satellite on April 17, 1983.    Since 1980, it has launched two other satellites, while three other attempts failed. Six Indian-made satellites have been sent into orbit by space agencies in the Soviet Union, U.S. and Europe.    On Tuesday, the Soviet Union su ccessfully launched the second of a pair of space probes on an 111 million-mile odyssey to explore Mars and help prepare for a manned flight to the red planet. </TEXT></DOC>
