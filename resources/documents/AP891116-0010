HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Salt, long believed a cause of high bloodpressure, may have the opposite effect on some people on strictlow-salt diets, a study says. But other doctors insist it's stillbetter to keep your hands off the shaker.   Dr. Brent Egan, director of the hypertension unit at the MedicalCollege of Wisconsin, said his study suggests that strictlylimiting salt intake could be bad for people with normal bloodpressure.   He said he believes that the American Heart Association'ssuggestion of limiting daily salt consumption to 7 grams, or about1{ teaspoons, is safe. But he said further study is necessarybefore more stringent rules are adopted for the general population.   ``I think there are some people who are harmed by severe tomoderate salt restriction, at least in the short term,'' said Egan,who based his findings on a diet experiment.   But, he cautioned, ``I am not suggesting that the populationshould run out and shake salt on their food.''   Egan presented his findings Wednesday at the heart association'sannual meeting, where his conclusions were immediately questionedby other high blood pressure experts.   ``I would challenge the notion that blood pressures went upbecause they went on low-salt diets,'' said Dr. Richard Grimm ofthe University of Minnesota. ``It may just be the normal variationin blood pressure. We haven't seen anything like that in ourstudies.''   An estimated 60 million Americans have high blood pressure. Itis a major underlying cause of heart attacks and strokes.   Large population studies have clearly linked salt with bloodpressure. They show that, in general, people's blood pressures riseas their salt intake increases.   Other factors associated with high blood pressure are obesity,low potassium consumption and heavy use of alcohol.   Public health experts have recommended that all Americans watchtheir salt intake, even though many people are not sensitive to thebad effects of salt. Some said they feared Egan's findings mightmake people think widely accepted dietary rules are potentiallyharmful.   ``It would be a big mistake for us to say that the modestreduction of salt that the American Heart Association recommendswould be detrimental to anyone's health,'' said Dr. TheodoreKotchen of West Virginia University.   In Egan's study, 27 men in their 30s went on alternatinghigh-and low-salt diets. During the low-salt phase, half of themen's blood pressures went down, and half rose.   Among those whose pressures went up, the researchers noticedthat their levels of low-density lipoprotein, the so-called badcholesterol, also increased, as did their levels of insulin anduric acid.   Egan said that when physicians put patients on low-salt diets,they should monitor these people to make sure that the regimens domore good than harm.   Among other studies presented Wednesday:   _Researchers from several institutions presented findings onminiature ultrasound devices that can be passed through the bloodvessels to give a ``fantastic voyage'' view of arteries and theheart. They said this unique view of the body should help themdiagnose problems and select and guide the instruments to correctthem.   _Doctors from the University of Oslo in Norway found that peoplewith large numbers of blood-clotting cells called platelets are atunusually high risk of death from heart disease. They followed2,014 middle-aged men for 13 years and found that the 25 percentwith the highest platelet counts had about double the death rate ofthe other men.   _Doctors from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston said anexperimental test appears to spot the earliest stages ofcholesterol's damage to the blood vessels. They found that whenexposed to the nerve chemical acetylcholine, healthy blood vesselsexpand, but if they are damaged, they contract. They hope to usethe test to spot early signs of trouble in heart transplantrecipients, who are at high risk for artery disease.</TEXT></DOC>
