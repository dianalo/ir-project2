However, the U.S. currency later managed to bounce back up aboveits worst levels of the day.   Gold prices also fell, but not as dramatically.   The August deficit of $12.18 billion compared with a revisedshortfall of $9.47 billion in July, was near the top end of marketexpectations, and prompted a bout of heavy selling that pushed thedollar to a session low of around 1.8110 West German marks.   ``The figure was as bad as expected, or maybe a bit worse,'' onedealer at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt said. ``The dollar is nowbattered.''   Dealers said technical support at the 1.8100-mark level andrumors that the U.S. Federal Reserve was checking dollar-yen rateshelped to push the dollar back to its closing levels.   But market players added that sentiment remained bearish, andmost said they expected the dollar to continue its downward move.   Any decline, however, would be limited by fear of central bankeffort to prop the dollar up.   The Frankfurt dealer said: ``The central banks will make surethat the dollar moves down only gradually. They don't want to riska crash, and just one year after the crash, this psychology isstrong in the market.''   Some analysts say the October 1987 stock market crash wastriggered partly by worse-than-expected trade figures, which hadsent the dollar into a tailspin.   is no way the central banks will let the dollar fall too farahead of the (U.S. presidential) elections in November,'' a Londondealer said.   In London, the dollar sank against the British pound. It cost$1.7470 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.7305 Wednesday.   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with lateWednesday's rates, included: 1.8193 West German marks, down from1.8340; 1.5390 Swiss francs, down from 1.5587; 6.1995 Frenchfrancs, down from 6.2770; 2.0475 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0760;1,354.00 Italian lire, down from 1,379.00; and 1.2084 Canadiandollars, down from 1.2118.   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,the dollar closed at 127.98 yen, down 1.67 yen. Later, in London,it was quoted at 127.95 yen.   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $406.70 a troy ounce,compared with $409.25 bid late Wednesday.   In Zurich, gold was lower, closing at a bid $406.50 comparedwith $408.10 bid late Wednesday.   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.69 to close at a bid $411.22.
