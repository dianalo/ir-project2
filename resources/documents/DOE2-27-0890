<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-27-0890 </DOCNO><TEXT>A mass-spectrometer type of leak detector is described for detecting gaseousatoms of a predetermined mass comprising: a rigid housing; an ion-detectingtarget means having an active detecting area; ionization means for ionizingthe atoms to produce ions; accelerating means for accelerating the ionsin a first direction; path defining means comprising a series of spacedapart baffles fixed to the housing and disposed along the path to definethe boundary of the path, and to deflect ions which cross the boundaryof the path; deflecting means comprising a magnet with generally opposedspaced apart pole pieces for generating a magnetic field having a firstportion with generally parallel lines of force between the pole piecesand a fringe area portion with generally non-parallel lines of forceoutside the pole pieces; and means for positioning the deflecting meanswith respect to the rigid housing, accelerating means and ion-detectiontarget means such that a magnetic field generated by such deflectionmeans orthogonally intersects the ion path for deflecting the ions awayfrom the first direction so as to form a concave path of ions extendingfrom the accelerating means through the baffles and to the active collectingarea of the ion-detecting target means with substantially the entireconcave ion path being in the magnetic field.</TEXT></DOC>
