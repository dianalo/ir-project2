(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Cannot import, export addressesandM;By Steve MichelandM;Rendezvous-Plus from PMC Telesystems Inc. is a program for managingappointments, individual schedules and to-do lists.andP;  It can manage a list ofnames, addresses and telephone numbers and comes with a Startup document(INIT) that can remind you of appointments, even while you are runninganother application.andP;  (For a comparison of several similar programs, seeMacWEEK, Dec.andP;  18, 1990.)andM;When you launch Rendezvous-Plus, you are presented with a calendar showingthe year, with the current day blinking.andP;  To use a calendar, you must firstopen a Diary file, a process called &quot;attaching&quot; in the documentation.andO;Thereafter, you can enter appointments and reminders in a couple of ways.andM;First, you can double-click on the name of the month to open a calendar forthat month.andP;  This lets you type or view general reminders about any day ofthe month.andP;  It does not give access to timed appointments.andP;  From the yearlycalendar, you also can double-click on any date to get a view of appointmentsfor that date.andP;  We were disappointed, however, to find that there was no wayto go to the daily Diary from the monthly calendar.andP;  To get to the Diary, youmust switch back to the yearly mode and double-click on the date again.andM;Priorities.andP;  Rendezvous-Plus has a couple of nice features for enteringappointments and reminders.andP;  First, you can assign keys to set priorities fora day's tasks by typing such keys as A, B or C before them.andP;  The programsorts tasks automatically, based on the letter codes you assign.andP;  While welike this capability, we would rather directly manipulate the priority ofitems with the mouse by dragging them up or down in the list.andP;  Still, it's ahandy feature.andM;You also can use codes to tell the reminder portion of the program how muchnotice to give you of an upcoming appointment.andP;  For example, if you want tobe reminded 10 minutes before an appointment, you can put a &quot;+10&quot; before theappointment.andM;One of Rendezvous-Plus' nicest features is task forwarding: Any tasks you didnot finish on one day can be carried over to the next.andP;  Another well-designedfeature is Rendezvous-Plus' handling of repeating tasks.andP;  It's not toodifficult to have the program remind you of simple things that do not varyfrom week to week, but it's also easy to set up more-complicated reminders,such as a reminder to do something on the last business day of each month.andM;Address-book shortcomings.andP;  When entering an appointment, you can hold downthe Option key and double-click on any name to open the Phone/Address window;the program will attempt to find that name in the directory.andP;  However, wewere disappointed with the address directory, for several reasons.andP;  First,there is no way to import or export records between Rendezvous-Plus and otherprograms.andP;  That means that even if you already have a set of names andaddresses in another program, you will need to retype them.andP;  It also meansyou will need to retype them if you later want to use them elsewhere (forexample, to perform a mail merge in your word processor).andP;  For those with alot of names and addresses already entered into other programs (and a lot oftime invested in entering those names and addresses), this is a seriousimpediment.andP;  PMC Telesystems said import and export would be added to afuture version.andM;Secondly, although the company claims that the program uses an &quot;advanceddatabase technology&quot; to store the names and addresses, this technology isunable to sort the name and address book.andP;  To enter the name &quot;Robbie Naish&quot;into the address book, for example, you'll need to select the N tab along theleft side of the address book.andP;  If you have other addresses beginning with N,you'll need to find the one that comes after Naish alphabetically and use theInsert Record command to create a new blank record (it should be noted thataddresses do not necessarily need to be in alphabetical order, but theprogram's Fast Find option will not work unless they are).andM;Finally, we were disappointed with the near-total lack of reportingcapabilities in the program.andP;  It prints nice calendars (yearly, monthly anddaily) and the address book fairly well.andP;  But there is no way to print a listof appointments (whether in the future or past) with a particular person.andO;The program's Find function, which defaults to searching backward, is usefulbut does not help you when creating reports for common needs, such as billingclients.andM;Conclusions.andP;  Given the narrow breadth of its feature set and its awkwardmethods for performing certain actions, we think Rendezvous-Plus isunderpowered.andP;  It tries to offer both appointment scheduling and addressmanagement, but it does neither very well.andM;The scheduling aspects of Rendezvous-Plus are adequate for most uses.andP;  It hasa few well-intentioned entry aids that make repetitive scheduling a breeze,and the appointment-notification procedure works as advertised.andM;The address database, on the other hand, is substandard, even archaic.andP;  Weshould not have to worry about manually alphabetizing our names, and therehas to be some mechanism for import and export of addresses.andP;  The inabilityto sort names is especially frustrating, given that you can sort taskpriorities.andM;PMC Telesystems is at P.O. Box 5127, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6B4A9.andP;  Phone (604) 255-9949; fax (604) 266-4257.andM;Rendezvous-PlusandM;PMC Telesystems Inc.andM;As an appointment scheduler and diary, PMC Telesystems' Rendezvous-Plus has afew good features, including easy scheduling of repeat tasks, but itsinability to exchange address information with other programs, its weakreporting functions and its sometimes-awkward interface detract significantlyfrom its usefulness.andP;  As an address book it fails, and what little it does asa scheduler it performs satisfactorily at best.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
