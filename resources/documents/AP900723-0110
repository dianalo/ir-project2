James W. Glosser, head of the department's Animal and PlantHealth Inspection Service, said the bees have not yet entered theUnited States but are expected to do so between late summer andnext spring.   Glosser said four interconnected trap lines have been completedin South Texas to capture and track swarms as they move north outof Mexico.   The bees are hybrid offspring of African bees brought to Brazilin 1956. Some escaped and mated with native bees.   Africanized bees can be aggressive when threatened and swarmquickly against an intruder. This characteristic has contributed totheir notoriety as ``killer bees,'' which USDA officials blame onhorror movies and exaggerated news reports.   ``In reality, the chances of being injured by an Africanized orany honeybee are far less than the chances of being hit bylightning,'' says a recent background paper on the bees.   Glosser said the four trap lines are located north ofBrownsville, Texas, near the Gulf coast. The northernmost line hasmore than 40 traps and runs about 50 miles from Sarita toRaymondville.   An intersecting line has about 60 traps and extends 80 milesfrom La Gloria to Port Mansfield on the coast. Another with about30 traps extends about 30 miles south of La Gloria to Rio GrandeCity. The fourth, with about 60 traps, runs parallel to the coastfor about 60 miles from San Perlita to Port Isabel.</TEXT></DOC>
