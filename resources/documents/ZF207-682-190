(products).andO;Product:   Minds (Computer program ).andO;Topic:     EvaluationHypertext.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A NEW APPROACH TO HYPERTEXT: MINDSandM;MINDS is called The Intelligent Book and that is close to the mark.andP;  This isa text-based, knowledge-representation tool set designed for development ofhypertext-like systems with rapid retrieval of original text andnatural-language queries using efficient search-and-match strategies.andP;  Theset is much easier to use than most hypertext editors because complexhierarchical structures and marking of predetermined keywords are notrequired; nor is the tedious prepping of existing text files by seriousindexing systems.andP;  Users are not asked to transverse menus, hypertext windowsor phrase and rephrase their queries--they simply type.andP;  Queries to a givenapplication can be made smarter through vocabulary utilities.andM;The most notable feature in MINDS is its speed.andP;  The world of text indexingand retrieval software is slow-moving and memory-hungry, but the C- andassembler-based MINDS is fast enough to be acceptable for large-scale text ona standard IBM PC-AT-class system, or even an XT, although it runs lowly onan XT.andP;  For this review, an 80386-20 Tandy 4000LX with a 25-ms hard drive and80-ns, 32-bit RAM was used, an environment in whcih it was useful with largetext applications.andP;  MINDS indexed 30 individual files (a total of 260K) andstructured 1,186 individual document references within the set in 19 minutes.andO;Most of the time was spent reading in the files.andP;  One 259K file with onedocument was indexed in four minutes.andP;  Terus Corp. estimates indexing a 320Kfile will require 20 minutes on a standard PC-AT.andP;  Queries to the 30-file setaveraged less than five seconds to find all hits, often more than one peroriginal file.andM;The MINDS system is modular: one module prepares text files and threeoptional retrieval modules retrieve them.andP;  The basic MINDS Authoring System(MAS) is used to define the structure of indices and then index text files tocreate a context set, the actual application.andP;  Fine-tuning of the indexedtext, structure maintenance, and later addition of text files to a contextset are also done here.andP;  The text retrievers are the MINDS Data Retriever(MDR), MINDS Resident Data Retriever (MRDR), and MINDS Dialup Data Retriever(MDDR).andP;  Once a context set is created, it can be used among them withoutchange.andP;  The modules can be customized for virtually any environment, and MASand MDR support shelling to DOS.andM;Information is found by asking a plain-language question within theretriever.andP;  Searches are performed on all text in the target set so norestriction by predetermined linkage occurs.andP;  Results are displayed in twoways.andP;  In &quot;full text&quot; mode, a hit is highlighted in the context of theoriginal document.andP;  The user can scroll above or below indefinitely.andP;  In&quot;extract mode,&quot; only the hit is displayed.andP;  Both can be toggled.andP;  Searchesare narrowed or expanded by entering simple phrases or entirely new queries.andO;Changing modes from review to query is unnecessary; to enter another query,one just begins typing.andM;THE AUTHORING SYSTEMandM;The MINDS Authoring System allows the developer to context sets from ASCIIfiles.andP;  Walking through the development of a simple set shows how usefulMINDS is in preparing and delivering applciations using stable text--the toolset is already used commercially for software documentation, reference ofFederal Aviation Administration regulations, technical support documentation,and distribution of medical data.andP;  The first exercise in the manual isindexing the MINDS documentation, supplied in both a slim, spiral-bound bookand a text file on the MAS disk.andP;  This gets the user started quickly and alsocompensates somewhat for the package's greatest weakness, the printeddocumentation, which is disorganized, hard to read, and incomplete.andP;  One canat least find things by querying the documentation set.andM;After a short time with the system, I was able to make a useful context setof three book chapters and their bibliographies.andP;  Obviously, this context setwill not be a lasting document, but it was so easy to assemble that redoingit later on the final text would not be burdensome.andP;  The MINDS query facilitylet me track, quickly and smoothly, where chunks of information were in thechapters and view their relationship.andP;  Another easily created set comprised2.5 years of monthly reports and their related text items.andP;  MAS quicklybecomes an indispensable everyday application.andM;MAS and the retrievers are menu driven.andP;  While MINDS does not provide for amouse, a Logitech mouse menu was easy to create.andP;  The authoring module comesup prepared to index.andP;  This menu contains all control options, includingsetting values the developer must specify to index a file properly and add itto a new or existing set.andM;The context option specifies the set.andP;  It took MINDS 2.72 seconds to createan empty context set, basically a three-file database structure.andP;  MINDS usesa data-file manager called the Item File System (IFS).andP;  Every set has threefiles, each an IFS file.andP;  Any number of records is allowed and each may holdany number of characters.andP;  The .VOC file contains all words in the text.andP;  A.KU file record has a title (any identifying sequence for a reference) andline numbers.andP;  An .IU file record is the original text.andP;  Several externalutilities can examine and manipulate these files and MAS has considerablecontrol from within for most applications.andP;  After text is added, amaintenance utility within MAS should be used to resize the data files tooptomize storage and retrieval.andP;  maintain usually takes no more than five to10 minutes on large sets.andP;  On the 80386-20, restructure is quite fast--4.5minutes on the 30-file set.andP;  For manual optimization of retrievals only, anexternal file-sizing utility is provided.andM;Creation of a context set means manipulating three different types ofinformation: documents, references and their titles, and vocabulary.andP;  Adocument is a single document from the source-text file.andP;  Usually, a sourceis retained as one document but can be turned into many different documents.andO;For example, an address file might be used with each entry as a singledocument; thus the query &quot;Get me Acme Repair&quot; would produce just that entry.andO;I created a context set for an annotated bibliography and specified eachentry as a document.andP;  In the context set reports, for example, each filecontained one to three paragraph chunks on a topic and each chunk was made adocument.andP;  A reference is a single connected piece of text within a document.andO;A title is the line at the top of the screen when the retriever displays ahit.andP;  Any developer-specified text entered or the first line of the documentis used as a default.andP;  Vocabulary is set by the index process, andcharacteristics of documents and their references are determined by a patternfile within MAS.andM;The developer returns to the main menu after each step with the next stephighlighted; it is virtually impossible to go wrong.andP;  After building the set,pattern designation is made.andP;  Patterns are independent and can be reused orcreated at this point to suit the particular text, including specializedformats of source code, multilevel outlines, and legal documents.andP;  The userselects pattern elements such as white space, blank lines, flush leftnumbers, and so forth that determine the beginning and ending of documents,references, or sections to be skipped entirely.andP;  Defining simple patterns isfairly easy: the &quot;andless;andless;&quot; is used to search for the beginning of a line, &quot;$&quot;indicates the end of a line,&quot;:--&quot; matches any space or tab.andP;  To define apattern for text where each paragraph is indented and all remaining lines areflush left, the sequence would be &quot;andless;andless;&quot;:--.&quot;andP;  The manual supplies eightexamples, including a pattern to define references for function names in Csource code and one to index legal depositions.andP;  MINDS patterns can becomequite powerful and complex and require experimentation and study.andM;Pattern flexibility is one of the aspects of MINDS that stands out most.andP;  Inmany text indexing programs, elaborate preparation of the original text fileis required: for example, embedding reference marks for pages or paragraphsbefore indexing.andP;  Most hypertext editors require mark and link work.andP;  MINDSneeds nothing more than reasonably neat ASCII files and the single-patternfile.andP;  I created my second context set in MINDS by pulling out backupfloppies and copying the 30 individual files into a single directory beforeusing MAS.andP;  No editing of the originals was required.andP;  In about 25 minutes,including indexing and sizing, disorganized recollection yielded to fast,effective retrieval.andP;  Spending about 45 minutes with the MAS vocabularyeditor let me refine the word files for intelligent response to queries bydefining synonyms for common acronyms, abbreviations, and proper names.andM;This is all that is required to prepare for automatic indexing.andP;  The systembegins by reading two-word files, either default or user-specific.andP;  Thesefiles control which words the retrievers will ignore in a search--the noiseor bad words that contribute nothing to search--and which words are synonyms.andO;Additional words can be marked later with the vocabulary editor.andP;  When thefile has been fully scanned, the indices and text are saved.andP;  If more thanone file is specified, the system repeats the process until no more matchesare found.andM;At this point, the three context-set files have data and a query can beconducted.andP;  MAS returns to a trial retrieve.andP;  If the file is small, this is agood way to be sure nothing has gone wrong in the indexing and that a patternis correctly specified.andP;  A verify option makes a test run to ensure that allfiles are found and that reference and document breaks occur where intended.andO;The verify procedure writes a log file that contains a copy of the sourcetext with extra information showing the various document, reference and pagebreaks, titles, and so on.andP;  With larger files, neither the trial-retrieve northe index-verify utilities work very well within MAS if they work at all,because memory is insufficient.andP;  The set can be queried by exiting MAS andusing one of the retrievers.andP;  A quick tour usually reveals if something hasgone wrong.andP;  It is recommended to return to MAS under any circumstance anduse maintain to optimize the IFS files and the built-in vocabulary editor tofine-tune the word lists, maintain had no problems with file size.andM;It is possible to use MAS at any time to add and manipulate files for anexisting context set.andP;  More than 32,000 files may be added to a single set.andO;The system can use more than 255 sets--potential capacity on a PC is morethan 8 million documents.andP;  The new document is appended, but there is nomethod for updating, deleting or editing text once it has been indexed; to doso would destroy the index structure.andM;WORD LISTSandM;The vocabulary editor is supplemented with report utilities to help thedeveloper optimize a set and streamline work.andP;  The New Words report aids whentext is added by letting the author review only words new to the vocabulary.andO;This facilitates addition of more than one new file followed by a single passwith the editor.andP;  The Bad Words report, generated during indexing, litsnoise-word matches in the source along with a count.andP;  If a word to be ignoredis not found in the text, it will not appear in the report, a valuabletime-saver.andM;The Synonym Words Report is a list of synonyms in the text.andP;  Each entry showsthe count, the word itself, and the word's root.andP;  These synonyms areuser-defined, not necessarily proper, synonyms.andP;  The synonym-control file isan ASCII file in the form: root=word 1,word2,....wordn.andM;Teh synonym-control file is especially useful for alternative spellings orforms for translation of foreign terms to be sure that a reference is notmissed such as: center=centre Macintosh=Mac,SE,AppleDeutschland=Germany,German.andM;The Keywords Report shows each word found in the text that is neither a badword or synonym.andP;  Each report line lists the key word and what referenceshave it.andM;These files can be edited quickly with the vocabulary editor since quick keysand look-up-and-store functions are designed for speed and automatically moveentries.andP;  A dynamic word-selection list is loaded at the start of the sessionto speed the process even more.andP;  This is a useful tool, but some sort of undoor escape capability would be helpful.andP;  It is too easy to mark two more wordsin sequence than you intended.andM;THE MINDS DATA RETRIEVERSandM;The MDR can be run from DOS, DesqView, or TopView windowing environments.andP;  Aset can be called directly on the MDR command line, leaving the user nothingmore complicated than entering the initial query, which can also be includedon the command line.andP;  MDR constructs the longest phrase possible from keywords in the question.andP;  If more than one phrase uses the same number of keywords, a window listing each phrase and the number of references isdisplayed.andP;  Select the phrase which best answers the query by entering thenumber to its left or by using the cursor keys to highlight it.andP;  Further, theprevious query can be made more specific by beginning a new query with acomma.andP;  Key words can be removed from the search by beginning with &quot;--.&quot;andP;  Toadd more references begin with &quot;+,&quot; and so on.andP;  It is also possible to queryby page number of the original text by typing the page number.andP;  The currentline of query can also be reviewed in a pop-up window.andP;  Pop-up help isavailable.andM;The MRDR is a memory-resident version of MDR.andP;  From the query point of view,it functions the same way.andP;  MRDR uses 94K of system memory, can be left as amemory-resident version, or unloaded with CTRL-F10.andP;  It can operate in apass-through mode by attaching it to a specific program.andP;  I experienced nomemory conflicts when using MRDR on a system with various common programs anda Logitech mouse driver and pop-up mouse menu, but unloading it presented aproblem.andP;  Terus technical support was excellent in sprining me from thatturned out to be a mouse trap.andP;  Load orders for other possible conflicts withpopular TSRs are documented, but the Logitech mouse pop-up problem wassomething Terus simply had not anticipated.andM;The MDDR is designed for online use.andP;  The MDDR package comes with a varietyof configuration options, including ANSI and TTY terminal support.andP;  MDDR usessix command-line parameters for screen configuration, asynchronous port andspeed settings, and transaction logs.andP;  The query process is the same as withMDR, and it works--I logged onto an online MDDR and made queries with thesame ease as in MDR and got fairly fast responses.andP;  It looks like an onlinehypertext concept just might be workable using MDDR.andM;Optimization and other functions can be run using the external utilityprograms supplied.andP;  Item File Status Display (ISTAT) verifies the integrityof an IFS file and optionally reports a list of item-identification codesthat can be used with several other MINDS utilities.andP;  Item Type (ITYPE),provides an easy method of extracting some or all of the original documenttext.andP;  ISIZE is used to optimize files manually.andP;  Other utilities includedata deletion and hex dump for advanced use.andM;DEVELOPMENT andamp; DOCUMENTATIONandM;MINDS is an efficient, effective text-indexing and retrieval package thatstrives for a straight interpretation of the hypertext concept and a view ofthe computer as a knowledge-processing device.andP;  It allows the user to movethrough electronic documents with minimal barriers between the inquiring mindand the text, and it is user friendly where many similar text-indexing andretrieval products are user hostile, inflexible, and counter-intuitive.andO;MINDS does this without sacrificing speed or refined retrieval performance.andO;The 2.3 package makes it clear, however, that the developers have put theirenergy into software development rather than documentation.andP;  The users manualis in sore need of reorganization, more examples, a troubleshooting sectionfor indexing problems, a better index, and a concise error-message appendix.andO;It is technically sound, but difficult for a new MINDS user or thoseunfamiliar with the principles of text indexing.andP;  Terus Corp. is aware of theproblems and plans a revision to be released soon.andM;Susan Shepard is a writer specializing in the microcomputer field.andP;  Inaddition to doing private consulting, she is a program consultant for theAcademy for Educational Development, an international consulting firm.andP;
