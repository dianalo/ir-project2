On Thursday, after the state's highest court ruled that a partnerin a long-term homosexual relationship can take over their apartmentwhen the leaseholder dies, Braverman said:   ``It means I won. A major burden is off my shoulders now.''   The case considered by the Court of Appeals involved another manin the same situation, and the ruling may affect thousands ofhomosexual men and women and their lovers _ their ``life partners''or ``spousal equivalents,'' in the legal lingo that has developed.   ``I think it's an historic event,'' said Arthur S. Leonard, aprofessor at New York Law School and chairman of the city barassociation's committee on law and sex. ``It's the first time I'maware of that the New York Court of Appeals has recognized that agay male couple may constitute a family, and obviously a lesbiancouple as well.   ``That's pretty exciting, pretty revolutionary.''   Lawyers are uncertain, but the ruling may also affect unmarriedheterosexual partners, older people who live together to save money,and poor families who can't afford legal fees to adopt children orobtain a divorce.   The most immediate effect of the ruling was on New York City'shomosexual community, which is being ravaged by AIDS.   ``It's courageous, I think,'' said Everett Quinton, 37, whoshared an apartment with playwright Charles Ludlam for 12 yearsbefore Ludlam's death in 1986. ``There was a bit of sympathy, ofhumanity. But then it was, `Sorry to hear about it, but you've gottaget out now.'   ``It's been happening all over. I'm glad this ruling came down.People can bury their dead and not immediately have to worry aboutwhere they'll stay.''   Quinton's apartment, however, was rent-stabilized, notrent-controlled, and Monday's ruling, while encouraging, doesn'textend to his situation.   Rent-control and rent-stabilization laws limit the rent increaseslandlords can charge for some apartments. The rent-control lawsapply to longterm tenants in apartments built before 1947.   The court expanded the definition of a family as it applies toNew York's rent-control laws, which say only ``family members'' maytake over rent-controlled apartments when the tenant of record dies.   The court said a long-term emotional and financial commitmentmakes a couple ``married'' in the law's eyes.   Protection against eviction doesn't rest on legal documents orblood relation, Judge Vito Titone wrote, ``but instead should findits foundation in the reality of family life.''   ``It is the totality of the relationship as evidenced by thededication, caring and self-sacrifice of the parties which should,in the final analysis, control,'' Titone said.   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Richard Simons said the court wastoo broadly interpreting the state Legislature's intent in draftingNew York's rent control law. The court's 4-2 decision, he said,``produces an unworkable test that is subject to abuse.''   For 54-year-old Braverman, who has AIDS, the ruling appears toremove the specter of eviction. More court hearings will decide that.   ``I thought dealing with AIDS was enough of a battle for anyone,but this extra thing _ taking away my home, my support system, myroots in the community _ that was an awful thing hanging over myhead,'' said Braverman.   ``Now that this has come down, the lower courts will move, Ihope, more aggressively to protect people in these circumstances,''said David Hansell, director of legal services for the Gay Men'sHealth Crisis.   Also on Thursday a law was scheduled to take effect in SanFrancisco permitting unmarried couples to register as ``domesticpartners,'' giving them certain rights such as the right tobereavement leave from a city job if the partner dies.   But its implementation was suspended pending certification ofsignatures on a petition seeking to put the measure on the Novemberballot and repeal it.</TEXT></DOC>
