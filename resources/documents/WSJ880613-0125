However, never have we seen the Journal's answers to two key questions that trouble many of the opponents of free immigration:   The first is the issue of labor wages. Does the Journal agree that free movement of labor would strongly promote the leveling of real wages internationally, just as the free movement of goods results in the leveling of goods prices and capital returns? If so, then does this not mean that real wages of those in the U.S. and other high-wage countries would tend to fall, especially in the low-skill categories, as large inflows of labor seek employment?    No doubt the availability of low-wage labor would in turn tend to boost investment, which would, as the capital stock increased, offset to some extent the reduction in wages. However, the increase in the capital stock would occur only with a lag and only in response to the decline in real wages. (The fact that one's left arm may become stronger as a result of a broken right arm is not a good argument for breaking the right arm.) Declines in real wages and increasing profit shares would be opposed by many on the basis of equity arguments. But even if we lay this issue aside, there is also the point that greater inequality in the distribution of income can lead to damaging social and political friction and instability.    The second question is a cultural one and more directly relates to points made by Mr. Le Pen: whether a nation should be indifferent to its cultural and ethnic makeup. There is no question that the Arab and Turkish immigrants into Western Europe have not in fact assimilated well. And there can be little question that massive new inflows would make it even more unlikely that these immigrants would be absorbed into the cultural framework of traditional France and West Germany.    Should France then be indifferent as to whether it should gradually become a predominantly Moslem country? Does the Journal also prescribe free immigration into Israel from all surrounding Arab countries? In most of the countries of the world, broadly maintaining the traditional culture and society of a nation is a matter of legitimate national concern. And recent experience very strongly indicates that this would be very difficult under conditions of unlimited immigration.    Michael Cayton   Butler, Pa.</TEXT></DOC>
