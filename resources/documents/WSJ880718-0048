White (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GM GME GOVMT </CO><IN> INS </IN><TEXT>   The war between Electronic Data Systems Corp. and its estranged founder, H. Ross Perot, is heating up in their home state.    The Dallas billionaire has quietly launched an effort to process Texas's Medicaid claims -- a lucrative contract that EDS has held for years and was on the verge of renewing just weeks ago.    Mr. Perot told Texas officials last month that his new company would bid against EDS to process about $800 million a year in Medicaid claims. Thus, Mr. Perot put into play a contract that EDS has held exclusively since 1977. The contract expires next year.    The pact could produce nearly $7 million in profit this year for EDS, a Dallas-based subsidiary of General Motors Corp., according to Texas officials. That amount is equivalent to about 2% of EDS's overall earnings last year.    The commissioner of the Texas Department of Human Services, Marlin Johnston, said Friday in a telephone interview that his department will seek bids on the Medicaid contract this fall, for the first time in six years. Until last month, Mr. Johnston said, the department was negotiating to renew EDS's contract for one or two more years because it didn't look like any other credible competitor wanted the job.    But after Mr. Perot in late June told members of the agency's three-member oversight board that his new company, Perot Systems Corp., would bid against EDS for the business, the agency decided to seek bids after all, Mr. Johnston said.    The Texas Medicaid contract is the newest battle in Mr. Perot's bitter two-year-old feud with GM, which he left as a board member in December 1986 as part of a controversial $750 million buy-out pact. Last month, the Texas entrepreneur formed Perot Systems and hired away about two dozen EDS employees.    But many other EDS employees, including some of Mr. Perot's earliest and closest associates, rejected his job offers. In their view, Mr. Perot is trying to harm the organization that he created and to which they have devoted their careers. EDS's president, Lester M. Alberthal, has said he told Mr. Perot he was &quot;disappointed that (Mr. Perot) would take action that had the potential of harming&quot; EDS.    An EDS spokesman said the company hadn't any comment on Mr. Perot's effort to win the Texas Medicaid contract. &quot;It doesn't do us any good to comment on what caused the state to put this out to bid,&quot; he said. &quot;When it goes up for renewal, we'll be a bidder.&quot;    Mr. Perot said Friday that he had no intention of bidding against EDS when he formed Perot Systems last month. But he said he changed his mind after EDS launched an attack last month on Perot Systems' proposed 10-year, no-bid contract to cut costs at the U.S. Postal Service.    That contract, announced June 2, is now in jeopardy, largely because of an administrative protest by EDS and other potential competitors as well as some opposition in Congress.    &quot;Once EDS and GM launched a massive legal and lobbying effort to crush the new company (Perot Systems), we were forced to go bid in the commercial sector,&quot; Mr. Perot said. When Texas puts the Medicaid contract out to bid, he added, &quot;we'll be there with bells on.&quot;    Mr. Perot has yet to win the Texas contract, but his moves threaten what had been one of EDS's oldest and most stable contracts. Although EDS gets about 62% of its $4.44 billion annual revenue from the computer and telecommunications services it performs for GM, it is eager to expand its business for other customers.    The buy-out agreement that Mr. Perot and GM signed in 1986 forbids Mr. Perot from competing with EDS on a for-profit basis until December 1989. Mr. Perot, however, says the provision isn't a handicap, because by forgoing profits for several months, he can underbid EDS.    In its talks with Texas officials about extending the Medicaid contract, EDS was pressing hard for more money, state officials said. Texas had capped EDS's profits this year on both claims payments and administrative expenses and was looking to reduce the amounts allowed for administrative costs, those officials added.    &quot;We had never come to a meeting of the minds relative to the compensation on an extension,&quot; J. Livingston Kosberg, chairman of the board that oversees the Texas Human Services department, said in an interview. &quot;I was prepared personally to sit down and try to narrow the difference, but we never quite got there.&quot;    He added, in an apparent reference to Mr. Perot's overtures: &quot;The longer the negotiations went on, the more the options developed for us.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
