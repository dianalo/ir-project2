Toavoid a RICO criminal trial, Mr. Milken agreed to settle withrestitution and fines of $600 million. Last week, Judge KimbaWood announced that her best estimate of total investorlosses from Mr. Milken's crimes was just over 300 thousanddollars -- $318,082 to be exact.   Compare this with, say, the $80 million Ivan Boesky stolewith insider trading and suddenly the case against Mr. Milkenis in perspective. Judge Wood's estimate of the harm causedby the six crimes of Mr. Milken's plea bargain also entitleshim to serve much less than her original harsh sentence of 10years. Parole guidelines say that people who cause less than$1 million in losses are often released after 24 months injail. Judge Wood, who expressed some surprise at her own lowestimate of the harm, said she expects Mr. Milken will serveabout three years in jail.</LP><TEXT>   Prosecutors argued that Mr. Milken's six crimes caused$4.7 million in market losses, but despite &quot;securities fraud&quot;in several transactions, Mr. Milken's disclosure violationsand other technical offenses were essentially harmless. Theexception was the commission Drexel Burnham Lambert collectedfrom the Finsbury mutual fund. Judge Wood didn't say so, buteven this $318,082 might not represent a loss. It would havebeen legal if it had been disclosed to pay a commission outof the bid-ask range for bonds. Also, this fraction of apercent commission was below what investors might haveexpected to pay.   Judge Wood's analysis was bad news for the legions oflawyers who sued Mr. Milken for billions in losses toinvestors. Her conclusions will not directly bind the judgeshearing the lawsuits against Mr. Milken, especially becausecivil suits have lower requirements of proof than a criminalsentencing. But Judge Wood's insistence on real evidence ofsome damage -- beyond what she called &quot;speculative testimonygiven by economists with warring `but for' scenarios&quot; --could give courage to other judges to dismiss these lawsuits.   Indeed, Judge Wood noted that prosecutors asked her not toquantify the losses because it might &quot;estop other governmentlitigants&quot; who sued Mr. Milken. The Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., for example, is still trying to pass the buck to himfor the savings-and-loan crisis. Federal agencies recentlyagreed to settle their vindictive $16 billion claims againstbankrupted Drexel for part of a $2.1 billion fund.   Judge Wood also began to put Mr. Milken into broadercontext. She said that three years in jail would &quot;fit thecrime and the offender, based on the evidence before thecourt, and was in proportion to the sentence given&quot; to IvanBoesky. By &quot;in proportion,&quot; Judge Wood said, she meant&quot;taking into account the relative harm to confidence in theintegrity of the securities markets caused by each man'scrimes, his involvement of others in the schemes, efforts tocover up . . . and, finally, each man's character, asrevealed, for example, in service to the community.&quot;   Under this measure, Judge Wood noted that Mr. Boesky&quot;would likely have actually served somewhere between five andseven years&quot; (her italics) if it weren't for his cooperationwith prosecutors. She concluded that Mr. Milken should serveabout half as long as Mr. Boesky would have served if hehadn't cooperated.   This must be a bittersweet triumph for Mr. Milken. Atleast Judge Wood finally made clear what has long beenobvious: Prosecutors traded down when they gave Mr. Boesky asweetheart sentence in exchange for evidence against Mr.Milken.   On the other hand, Mr. Milken's punishment remains out ofproportion. Of the hundreds of billions of dollars in Mr.Milken's transactions during the 1980s, the government provedthat (at most) a few hundred thousand were criminal.   In contrast with Mr. Boesky's insider trading, recall thekinds of offenses that Mr. Milken admitted -- such as aidingand abetting in someone else's false securities filing. Untilprosecutor Rudolph Giuliani, these were typically handled asadministrative or civil matters, not as crimes, certainly notas &quot;racketeering.&quot; Prosecutors did not prove Mr. Milkencommitted insider trading or any other reasonablyrecognizable crime. Junk bonds, whose market unraveled afterprosecutors removed Mr. Milken, are not illegal -- yet.   Also compare Mr. Milken's three years in jail, scheduledto be followed by three additional years of full-timecommunity service, with the time served by Wall Street'sinside traders. Mr. Boesky served just over two years. Hisaccomplice Dennis Levine served less than two years andMartin Siegel, another Boesky pal, served just six weeks.Judge Wood noted that these three each caused more than $1million harm in the market.   Mr. Boesky got a light sentence because prosecutorsclaimed he was &quot;the most useful cooperator in the history ofthe securities laws.&quot; Yet the same prosecutors refused tocall their star witness to testify at Mr. Milken'spre-sentencing hearing. One explanation is that Mr. Boeskyperjured himself when he claimed Mr. Milken was the big-timecriminal described in the original RICO indictment. Mr.Siegel was also rewarded, despite being the only &quot;witness&quot;against Richard Wigton and Timothy Tabor, who were arrestedonly to have all the charges dropped two years later for wantof evidence. Much of the blame could rest on credulousprosecutors only too happy to believe their unreliablesources.   There was an amusing episode in last week's court session.Judge Wood said that the Justice Department had looked intoseveral leaks to the press over the years about the Milkencase. The most notorious leak involved a Securities andExchange Commission memo about its decision to pursue Mr.Milken; the leak gained damaging headlines, but the allegedcrimes were never proved. The SEC memo apparently was closelyheld among a few government officials and its release wouldbe a crime, yet Justice could not find the leaker.   Justice did find an &quot;only instance where the source of aleak is known.&quot; This rare leak favorable to Mr. Milkendescribed the views of his probation officer. It was reportedin the Journal, including in this column on Sept. 26, 1990(&quot;These findings are confidential,&quot; I wrote, but theprobation officer &quot;concludes Mr. Milken's contributionsoutweigh his crimes&quot;). Without confirming or denying thegovernment's conclusion, it's worth noting that Justice says&quot;a non-government source&quot; leaked this information, butsomehow it can't find any government sources for any leaks.   Claims that Mr. Milken somehow defrauded investors are adisappearing act worthy of a three-ring circus. Thedisproportionality of $318,082 is the hardest evidence yetthat U.S. v. Milken had more to do with a political andselective prosecution of the &quot;junk-bond, takeover king&quot; thanany alleged crime the symbol committed. The case against theprosecution is far from closed, but meanwhile Mr. Milkenbegins his jail sentence on Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
