(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scholarly pursuits gave way to a sodataste test, dismantling a car and other bizarre pursuits asCalifornia Institute of Technology underclassmen tried to breakinto seniors' cleverly defended rooms.   In an annual ritual known as Ditch Day on Thursday, the studentssolved puzzles or met elaborate requirements to gain entry to therooms of seniors, who remained on campus at the risk of being tiedto a tree.   ``We had a report that a senior came back and was tied to atree,'' said Marty O'Brien, 19, of Houston, who fielded questionsat ``Ditch Day Central.''   For obscure reasons the challenges left by the seniors are knownas ``stacks.''   O'Brien said one stack he came across involved disassembling acar and making the pieces fit in four 55-gallon drums.   Students working on other stacks found they had to climbbuildings. ``There's been reports of clues being placed on thesides of buildings 25, 30 feet in the air,'' O'Brien said.   The sophomore said he worked on a stack created by a senior wholeft a computer terminal outside his door. The computer askedquestions and, when given the right answer, delivered part of thecombination to the lock.   The stack's rules required students to don ``lab coats and nerdysafety glasses so we could look as scientific as possible'' and setup a soda taste test on a campus walkway, O'Brien said.   ``It looks like RC (Cola) slimly over Coke, and Pepsi was waydown at the end,'' said the chemical engineering major.   O'Brien and his cohorts eventually got into the room.   ``I thought we had moments of inspiration which were quitehelpful,'' he said.   Freshman Mark Dinan, 18, of Washington, D.C., was part of a crewwhose stack required them to collect $5 for Amnesty International,water 10 plants around campus, erect anti-Ronald Reagan andanti-George Bush signs, and write and sing a song to find codewords spread around the school.   ``We ran into some trouble one time because somebody stole theclue,'' Dinan said, adding that the puzzle was solved within 4{hours.</TEXT></DOC>
