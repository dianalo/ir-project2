<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-09-0944 </DOCNO><TEXT>The potential value of space-based radio observatories and VLBI networksfor studies of cosmology, AGN and starburst galaxies, the ISM and theintergalactic medium, and molecular clouds and star formation is discussed.Topics examined include distance estimates for masers in external galaxies,high-resolution 21-cm observations of distant-galaxy kinematics and morphology,searches for LF emission from the neutral ISM at redshifts higher thanthe QSO turnon, detection of changes in the distribution of dark mattersurrounding galaxies at redshifts near 1, and observations of GalacticSNRs and filamentary structures near the Galactic center. Considerationis given to comparative studies of the ISM in the Galaxy, the MagellanicClouds, and M 31; estimates of the molecular content of external galaxies;emssion-line studies of H{sub 2}O masers; and kinematic investigationsof bipolar flows and molecular disks. 19 references.</TEXT></DOC>
