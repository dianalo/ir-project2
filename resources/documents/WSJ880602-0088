A disappointed Mikhail Gorbachev condemned the U.S. for blocking progress in arms control and other issues, saying, &quot;We could have achieved more in this meeting.&quot; Nonetheless, the Soviet leader told a post-summit news conference: &quot;We moved one rung, two rungs up the ladder, and this itself is a momentous fact.&quot;    A senior U.S. official said the greatest success of President Reagan's first trip to the Soviet Union was in &quot;psychological disarmament.&quot; The two leaders broke down some of the relationship's hostility before a world audience by publicly disagreeing over human rights and other issues but still strolling amiably together through Moscow's Red Square.    Mr. Gorbachev's news conference, his first in the Soviet Union, was a mixture of hard-line attacks on U.S. intransigence, to satisfy Communist Party conservatives, and praise of the limited progress made, to justify his policy toward the U.S. He dismissed Mr. Reagan's charges of continuing human-rights violations in the Soviet Union, which overshadowed the meetings, as &quot;a propaganda gambit, a spectacle.&quot;    Mr. Reagan, tired but clearly satisfied, was more conciliatory toward Mr. Gorbachev. Trying to cool controversies fueled by his visit with dissidents and with Jews denied the opportunity to leave the Soviet Union, he suggested in his news conference that emigration restrictions were largely bureaucratic obstacles that he and the Soviet leader could jointly overcome.    Mr. Reagan renounced his previous condemnation of the Soviet Union as an &quot;evil empire,&quot; made early in his presidency, and said, &quot;I think there's quite a difference today in the leadership and the relationship between our two countries.&quot;    Despite such kind words toward Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Reagan didn't give any ground in negotiations on the most troublesome obstacles to a strategic-arms reduction treaty -- sea-launched cruise missiles and space defense systems. Soviet officials were clearly unhappy that the U.S. balked at signing a separate statement that would have recorded their progress toward finalizing a strategic-arms treaty. The arms agreements the two sides signed -- on jointly conducted nuclear testing experiments and on pre-notification of ballistic missile launches -- were comparatively minor.    However, one U.S. official said negotiators here accomplished in two days what negotiators in Geneva couldn't have achieved in two months regarding strategic arms. He said they have made significant progress toward verifying mobile-missile cuts and came considerably closer to agreement on how to count and verify reductions of air-launched cruise missiles.    The U.S. official doubted this would be sufficient to conclude a strategic-arms treaty before the end of the Reagan administration. Both Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev, however, said they still want to finish the treaty.    Mr. Gorbachev's frustration was evident. He complained about the U.S. response to his new conventional-arms proposal calling for reductions of a half million troops on each side, to Soviet strategic-arms positions and to a statement pledging peaceful coexistence that Mr. Gorbachev foresaw as the centerpiece to the summit's closing statement.    U.S. officials said they rejected the statement, despite Mr. Reagan's initial interest, because its vague nature left it open to conflicting interpretations.    The Soviet leader gave vent to his criticism of Washington's policies in general toward Moscow, which he described as filled with contradictions. He attacked Mr. Reagan's constant talk of negotiating from a position of strength, and accused the U.S. of &quot;intimidation&quot; in its trade policies.    Senior U.S. officials said the two sides had their frankest discussion yet on regional issues, finding some common ground on questions regarding southern Africa, the Middle East and Cambodia. However, the progress wasn't enough to bring solutions much closer.    On the Middle East, Mr. Gorbachev said the two sides agreed on the need for an international conference, but there were still differences over its mandate. He also said the Soviet Union may re-establish diplomatic relations with Israel if such a conference could be convened.    But regarding Afghanistan, Mr. Gorbachev hinted that there may be more tensions ahead. Soviet officials have said they hope the Afghan settlement, which involves the U.S. and the Soviet Union acting as guarantors, could be a model for the solution of other regional conflicts. But Mr. Gorbachev complained to Mr. Reagan that Pakistan was violating the accords, and about new &quot;provocations.&quot;    Mr. Gorbachev said Soviet troops in Qandahar and the Soviet Embassy in Kabul had been fired upon, adding: &quot;There are attempts being made to frustrate this agreement. That would have serious negative consequences, and we stated that outright to the president and the entire American delegation.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
