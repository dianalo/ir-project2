(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jeanne Sharp, whose ancestors lived andfarmed in this rural New York community before the AmericanRevolution, is learning a hard lesson about rebellion: Governmentsoften fight back.   Sharp and more than 300 other residents who filed a lawsuittrying to block construction of a garbage incinerator are in turnbeing sued, by lawmakers.   ``I've been thinking a lot about Ethan Allen,'' said Sharp. ``Ihave some idea of what my ancestors went through to get here.   ``If they can put up with it, so can I.''   Residents sued Washington County and adjoining Warren Countylast year over the proposed incinerator, which is to be built inHudson Falls, about 40 miles north of Albany, to burn garbage forboth counties. They contend that local officials approved the planwithout a proper public hearing.   The counties and their industrial development agencycountersued, seeking $1.5 million from 320 plaintiffs, most of themWashington County residents. Washington County later dropped out,but Warren County and the IDA remain.   The residents, recognizable around the area by the bright orange``PLAINTIFF'' bumper stickers affixed to their cars, say thecountersuit was filed to harass them into dropping their lawsuit.   Environmentalists say it could have national implications forother citizen action groups that turn to the courts to challengecontroversial projects. The environmental movement even has a namefor it _ a SLAPP suit, or Strategic Lawsuit Against PublicParticipation.   ``It's a strategy to hush people up and stop them from speakingout,'' said Lois Gibbs, who led the fight over the Love Canal toxicdump in Niagara Falls and now runs the Virginia-based CitizensClearinghouse for Hazardous Waste.   ``This case stands out as the only one of its kind that I knowof where government chooses to sue its own people,'' said WillCollette, Citizens Clearinghouse's SLAPP suit expert.   Other SLAPP suits, which Collete calls ``legal terrorism,'' havebeen brought across the country by private companies involved inprojects. ``The idea is to squash the opposition.''   People who bring SLAPP suits don't expect to win them, he said.``They all get dropped. They never go to trial. Warren County hasno expectation of winning its case.''   In Washington County, some supervisors told people they mightlose their homes or cars as a result of the countersuit, theplaintiffs claim.   ``They're trying to harass us and intimidate us down to ahandful of manageable troublemakers,'' said Melody Brown, whoadmits to being one of the more vocal incinerator opponents beingsued.   The countersuit contends the citizens' lawsuit was frivolous andthat actions by the incinerator opponents, during the sale of bondsfor the project, cost the counties $1.5 million.   ``At the original closing date for the bond sale, there werecommitted purchasers. As the result of the activities of thecitizens, those contracts were abrogated, it was necessary to enterinto new contracts, and passage of time and a change in the marketbrought a $1.5 million loss,'' said Benjamin Pratt, a Glens Fallslawyer for the counties and IDA. That loss increased the cost ofthe project and with it the cost of burning garbage.   Now the incinerator opponents want to add more litigation to thefray _ a federal civil rights lawsuit in response to the lawsuitagainst them. They've hired Atlanta-based civil rights lawyerRobert Remar.   ``The First Amendment to the Constitution gives all of us theright to freedom of speech, freedom of association and the right topetition government for redress of grievances,'' said Remar. ``Whena government seeks to basically punish the citizens for havingexercised those rights, that's a violation of the Constitution.''   Pratt said the counterclaim doesn't violate anyone's civilrights.   ``They have the right to speak with respect to the proceedingsand actions being taken by the government. They have a right to suetheir government if they feel that something is done improperly.But they don't have the right to ... perform in such a fashion thatthey interfere with the contractual rights that the government haswith third parties and cause a $1.5 million loss.''   Hammond Robertson, chairman of the Warren County Board ofSupervisors, said he supports the counterclaim, as has a majorityof that board every time someone moves to drop it.   ``I have to recognize that people have some strong feelings onthis issue,'' said Robertson. ``But there are 110,000 people inthese two counties. We have some obligation to the other 100,000people.''   While the lawsuits go on over the $80 million incinerator _resolution isn't expected until some time next year _ excavation isnearing completion at the plant site next to the Hudson River.   Meanwhile, the incinerator has hit a legal snag in yet anotherlawsuit. A state judge ruled that the state should have requiredmore environmental assessments of the project before renewing itslatest permits. That suit was brought by the village of HudsonFalls. Construction has stopped while the state considers whetherto appeal.   The main point of the original lawsuit, whether there was apublic hearing on the project, is still in dispute. While Robertsonsaid a hearing wasn't required, Pratt said the two-county IDA heldone.   Stephanie Wenk, another active incinerator opponent, said theIDA hearing lasted just 45 minutes and that everyone wasn't allowedto speak.   ``The public hearing was a sham,'' said Wenk, who has been knownto tie a gag over her mouth at supervisors' meetings. ``They let 11people speak out of 49 ... Then they just banged the gavel and thatwas it.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Nov. 22</NOTE></DOC>
