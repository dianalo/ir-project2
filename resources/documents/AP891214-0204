Jean Pierson, chief executive officer of Europe's AirbusIndustrie, raised the idea for the first time Wednesday in a speechto an airline industry group. Airbus, based in Toulouse, France, isa consortium of four aircraft companies _ from France, Britain,West Germany and Spain _ that competes with Boeing Co. andMcDonnell Douglas Corp. of the United States.   Boeing, the largest commercial aircraft maker, was caught bysurprise by Pierson's remarks.   ``Boeing and other companies have been studying the viability ofhigh-speed transport but it's too early to tell what kind ofairplane may emerge from those studies or how it might beproduced,'' said Richard Schleh, a Boeing spokesman in Seattle.``Certainly, international cooperation is one option that meritscontinued study.''   Officials of McDonnell Douglas weren't immediately available forcomment.   ``That there will be a son of Concorde is beyond doubt,''Pierson said, referring to the supersonic passenger jets jointlybuilt by France and Britain. ``When and how is another question.''   Because of the enormous investment required by such a projectand the relatively small market for the aircraft, the jets shouldbe produced in one worldwide program, Pierson told the Wings Club.   ``The most brilliant engineers, the super-minds from the USA,Europe and Japan working together as a team to produce a worldplane, a plane that will shrink our planet further, is not autopian dream,'' he said.   He proposed an international consortium, based in the UnitedStates, that would bring together U.S., European and Far Easterncompanies to produce and market new high-speed jets.   However, he warned, such a consortium only would succeed as atrue partnership of equals, as in Airbus.   ``If instead, one of the participants were to seek supremacyover others or were to attempt to divide the others to rule, thenthere is no doubt that Europe, through Airbus Industrie, would haveno recourse but to go its own way.   ``There would inevitably, then, be two supersonic transportprograms competing fiercely for a limited market.''   In response to a question, Pierson said he hasn't yet discussedthe SST consortium idea with potential partners. However, he added,``I intend to be active on the subject.''   Airbus, which has had increasing success in selling jets to bigairlines around the world, now holds an estimated 30 percent of themarket for commercial aircraft.   The partners in Airbus are Aerospatiale of France, BritishAerospace PLC, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm Gmbh of West Germany andCasa of Spain.</TEXT></DOC>
