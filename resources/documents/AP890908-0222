Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann had long indicated he wouldconditionally approve Daimler's 1.7-billion-mark bid to take overaerospace and armaments giant Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm.   At a news conference today, Haussmann said he chose to override aFederal Cartel Office ruling that the takeover could give unfaircompetitive advantages to the combined corporations because of the``considerable economic advantages'' of the takeover.   Opponents of the merger had claimed it would create the largestdefense contractor in the nation, making it hard for smaller WestGerman firms to compete for federal contracts.   Daimler, already the largest industrial firm in West Germany,still must approve the conditions outlined by Haussmann.   The Stuttgart-based automaker issued a statement saying theEconomics Ministry conditions would be reviewed carefully by companypresident Edzard Reuter, who would disclose his decision at a pressconference on Monday.   The merger would create the third largest industrial concern inEurope with sales of 80 billion marks, or $40 billion, annually.   Among the economic advantages of the merger, Haussmann said, wasthat Daimler would eventually be assuming the government's 37percent share of the European Airbus Industrie consortium, whichcurrently needs large subsidies from the Bonn treasury to competewith other major aerospace manufacturers like Boeing and McDonnellDouglas.   One of the stipulations attached to the takeover plan byHaussmann was that the combined enterprises assume the Airbus risksthree years earlier than offered under the original proposal.   That would mean that MBB will take over the government's 20percent stake in Deutsche Airbus AG by Dec. 31, 1996.   Haussmann said the privatization of West Germany's share inAirbus would save the government $2.5 billion by the year 2000,which would be passed on to taxpayers or added to pension funds.   ``This would also put us on the road to resolving one of theissues raised by the United States'' in discussion of WestGerman-U.S. trade relations, Haussmann told reporters.   American aerospace giants like Boeing have contended thatgovernment subsidies for Airbus gave the consortium unfaircompetitive advantages, Haussmann noted.</TEXT></DOC>
