The compound will be tested on human transplant patients whenthat is approved the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said Dr.Randall Morris, director of Stanford University's laboratory fortransplant immunology.   ``It's a promising new addition to the drugs we already have andis an example of how we are engineering drugs based on ourknowledge of DNA synthesis,'' Morris said.   The drug mycophenolic acid, produced by a fungus, inhibits theformation of DNA, the genetic material that also is critical in thegrowth of skin lesions common to psoriasis.   Researchers altered mycophenolic acid to make it more easilyabsorbed by the body. In its altered form, mycophenolic acidmorpholinoethylester, or RS 61443, it blocks the DNA processrequired for white blood cells to attack transplanted organs,according to Morris.   ``It's not shutting down DNA all over the body. It's shuttingdown DNA synthesis in these (white blood cells), which is exactlywhere we want to shut it off,'' Morris said from Atlanta, where hepresented his findings Monday to members of the American College ofSurgeons.   Morris said it is too early to predict the role RS 61443 mightplay in relation to cyclosporine, the popular anti-rejection drugwhose use was pioneered by Dr. Thomas Starzl of the University ofPittsburgh.   The two drugs are extremely effective when used together, Morrissaid.   ``It allows you to lower the dose of both drugs, therebyminimizing the toxic effect,'' he said.   Cyclosporine, approved for general use by the FDA in 1983,suppresses the body's entire immune system and therefore enhancesthe risk of infection. Side effects include kidney failure.   High doses of RS 61443 have produced anemia, Morris said.   Rejection is responsible for most failed transplants, expertssay. There were 12,798 organ transplants in the United States in1988, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing.   ``Anything that comes along that would lower rejection rateswould be great,'' said Dr. William Vaughn, the network's directorof research.   Morris and other Stanford researchers have used RS 61443 in morethan 150 heart transplants involving rats, mice and, most recently,monkeys.   The drug is manufactured by Syntex Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif.   Oral doses of RS 61443 were administered daily for 50 days,Morris said. The transplanted hearts of rats receiving high dosesfunctioned properly for more than 200 days. Animals' transplantedhearts failed within a week when no medication was given.   The new drug effectively halted and sometimes even reversedrejection of the rats' transplanted hearts when administered forthe first time five days after surgery, he said.   Morris said RS 61443 stands out from other experimentalanti-rejection drugs in that its action on the body is fullyunderstood.   ``This drug represents a more rational way of affecting orcontrolling the immune system because we're actually going to theheart of biochemistry that we understand,'' he said. ``We're usingour knowledge to develop drugs that control the immune system in avery predictable way.''</TEXT></DOC>
