David Blundy was the Washington correspondent for theLondon-based Sunday Correspondent newspaper and had recently cometo this capital to cover the renewed fighting for the paper. He was44.   A sniper's bullet struck Blundy in the Mejicanos district of SanSalvador as he and several other journalists were stopped bysoldiers from getting too close to the battleground, said editorPeter Cole.   ``A single shot came from a building opposite,'' Cole said.``Everyone fell to the ground, there was a burst of gunfire andafter that, when the shooting stopped, the others got up but Davidwas still down.''   Cole said Blundy's colleagues took him to Rosales Hospital wheredoctors removed the bullet that had entered his shoulder andpierced a lung. Cole said the journalist survived the operation butdied several hours later.   The editor said Blundy had asked to be sent to El Salvador lastweek to cover the heaviest guerrilla offensive in the decade-oldcivil war.   ``He was used to danger and a highly experienced reporter,''Cole said.   Blundy was New York correspondent for the Sunday Times from1978-82, then chief foreign correspondent, mainly responsible forthe Middle East and Africa. He joined the Sunday Telegraph in July1986 but left this year to join the 2-month-old Correspondent asits Washington-based writer.   ``He went into some very hot spots, like Beirut and NorthernIreland,'' Sunday Telegraph editor Trevor Grove said.   Don Berry, the assistant editor at the Daily Telegraph,described Blundy as highly professional and very brave. He saidBlundy was interested in covering Central America and had beenstudying Spanish.   ``He was a lovely 6-foot, 5-inch, big man with not an enemy inthe world,'' Cole said. ``He was laconic, self-deprecating andalways good to be with, at the same time an extraordinary,brilliant journalist.''   Cole added Blundy had been preparing to go to the U.S.-Sovietsummit on ships off Malta in two weeks.   Cole said Blundy, who was divorced, had two daughters, aged 18and 2.</TEXT></DOC>
