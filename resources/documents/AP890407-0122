In a half-hour speech in London's Guildhall, the Sovietpresident called his unilateral action ``another major step towardthe complete cessation of production of fissionable materials foruse in weapons.''   Arms experts said today that while uranium and plutonium areboth used in Soviet nuclear weapons, plutonium is used more oftenand that Moscow has enough on hand to produce more weapons.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told reporters the Soviet move``will have no effect in practice'' because ``they probably havequite a sufficient stockpile of uranium.''   In Washington, President Bush declined to comment on Gorbachev'sannouncement, saying he had not had time to review it.   A Pentagon official said the steps outlined by Gorbachev wouldnot have a major impact on the Soviet capability to wage war.   Gorbachev reiterated promises he made at the United Nations inDecember that the Soviet Union would soon begin paring 500,000 menfrom its standing army and withdrawing troops and tanks from Europeand the Chinese frontier.   Gorbachev made a strong appeal for world disarmament, but hewarned the process could falter if the West did not reciprocate.   After the address, broadcast live throughout Britain and theUnited States, Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, called on QueenElizabeth II at Windsor Castle, then left for Moscow at the end ofa six-day trip to Ireland, Cuba and Britain.   Gorbachev invited the queen to visit the Soviet Union. She saidshe would like to accept but that her foreign travel is alwaysfixed years in advance.   Queen Elizabeth II would be the first monarch to go to Russiasince her grandfather's cousin, Czar Nicholas II, and his familywere killed after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.   Speaking at Guildhall, the city's seat of government for 1,000years, Gorbachev said the world has reached a crossroad in which ithas to choose between peaceful interdependency and ``a policy offorce rooted in the past.   ``If NATO goes ahead with its program of modernizing tacticalnuclear weapons,'' he said, ``this is bound also to devalue much ofwhat has been achieved under the INF treaty'' on medium-rangenuclear weapons that he signed with President Ronald Reagan in 1987.   Gorbachev said, ``In addition to the industrial reactor for theproduction of weapons-grade plutonium shut down in 1987, we plan toshut down two other such reactors this year and next year withoutcommissioning new units to replace them.''   ``We have completed the construction of a facility for thedestruction of chemical weapons and indeed to invite soon yourrepresentatives to visit it,'' Gorbachev said.   British experts on nuclear arsenals said it was difficult toassess the impact of the Soviet cutbacks in production offissionable materials because the number of such productionfacilities is secret.   A nuclear physicist in England, who also requested anonymity,said that uranium and plutonium are both still used in nuclearweapons production but that plutonium is in wider use in the SovietUnion and the United States.   Francois Heisbourg, director of the London-based Institute ofStrategic Studies, said Gorbachev's announcement that the Sovietswould close two plutonium-producing reactors was new.   But he said it was ``not as significant as it may sound becausethere is already plenty of plutonium around which the Soviets canuse to make bombs.''   The Pentagon official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidthe Soviets ``have stockpiles of weapons-grade materials'' andcould restart production in several years when supplies run low.   Reiterating earlier promises, Gorbachev also said armed manpowerwould be cut by 12 percent, the military budget by 14 percent andweapons production by nearly 20 percent. Military factories arebeing switched to production of consumer goods, and militarytransport planes would be redeployed to carry civilian cargoes, hesaid.   He said the new Supreme Soviet, a legislative body to beselected by the recently elected parliament, will publish thenation's defense budget, most of which is now concealed.   The speech got a standing ovation from the civic and politicalleaders at Guildhall and a ringing endorsement by Mrs. Thatcher.   ``We want you to succeed in your task,'' she said after thespeech. ``We're ready to help in practical ways.''</TEXT></DOC>
