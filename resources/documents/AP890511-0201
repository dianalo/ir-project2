QUINN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A fire that gutted a breeding centerhousing about 500,000 laboratory mice will cause a worldwidedisruption of laboratories researching AIDS, cancer and otherdiseases, officials said Thursday.   Kenneth Paigen, the incoming director of Jackson Laboratory,pledged ``to get back up as fast as we possibly can'' as salvageteams searched for living mice within the research center'sstill-smoldering animal production facility.   The laboratory, which distributes about 2 million mice annuallyto researchers, is the world's leading non-profit supplier anddeveloper of mutant mice bred in hundreds of genetically identicalstrains.   About a half-million mice would be in the facility on any givenday, officials said, but there was no estimate of how many or whattypes might have survived.   Paigen said the center had saved its ``foundation stocks'' ofspecially bred mice but warned that supply disruptions would hamperresearchers who need the mice to investigate cancer, AIDS and otherhuman diseases.   ``Thousands of labs, literally all over the world, depend on usfor supplies of mice, genetically defined animals,'' Paigen said.   ``I think it's safe to say we have some of everything, but howmuch we have of anything is not clear right now,'' said PhilipStandel, director of animal production. The laboratory, located twomiles outside the picturesque resort village of Bar Harbor, housedabout 1,000 strains of mice, many of them rare.   ``The impact is going to be terrific, really detrimental,'' saidSalome Waelsch, a professor of molecular genetics at the AlbertEinstein College of Medicine in New York.   ``There is no way of restoring this facility by just importingmice from elsewhere,'' said Waelsch, a member of the NationalAcademy of Science.   Dr. Richard Sidman, a professor of neuropathology at the HarvardMedical School and a senior research scientist at Children'sHospital in Boston, predicted the fire would ``modify the pace ofresearch'' for up to a year.   Philip Leder, chairman of the Genetics Department at the HarvardMedical School, described Wednesday's fire at the Bar Harborcomplex as ``a tragedy.''   While the lost mice can be replenished eventually, Leder said,``it's just going to take a tremendous amount of energy, investmentand time.''   State Fire Marshal Donald M. Bisset said the fire was accidentaland was apparently linked to ``a product that gave off flammablevapors'' that was being used by renovation workers in the building.   One worker suffered extensive burns in the fire and was listedin satisfactory condition Thursday at Maine Medical Center inPortland, said hospital spokeswoman Sharon Sturgeon.   Two other construction workers injured in the fire remained inthe Mount Desert Island Hospital in Bar Harbor, where they werelisted in stable condition.   Inside the laboratory's research center, which was not involvedin the fire, supervisory staff handled a steady stream of phonecalls from Jackson Laboratory customers, explaining that damageassessments had only just begun.   ``It's universities, it's hospitals, it's government agencies,pharmaceuticals,'' said John Pomroy, an assistant manager.   Paigen, who assumes the director's post full-time this summer,vowed that the center would recover fully from the fire.   ``The major decision we made, in fact we never considered analternative, is that we're rebuilding,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
