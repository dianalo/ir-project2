DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A congressional report shows that politicalappointees are taking over mid-level federal jobs traditionallyheld by career civil servants, a House subcommittee chairman saidWednesday.   Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., chairman of the human resourcessubcommittee of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service,released a General Accounting Office report showing that 64political appointees in 18 agencies had recently been converted tocareer status.   ``The increasing number of conversions of political appointeesinto career positions is troubling, especially where ... (they)infiltrate mid-level management positions traditionally held bylong-time civil servants,'' Sikorski said.   Sikorski called upon the Bush administration to implement someof the recommendations of the privately financed NationalCommission on the Public Service, which has recommended among otherthings a decrease in the ratio of political to career employees.   The commission, in recommendations submitted to the presidentlast month, called for reducing the number of political apointeesfrom 3,000 to 2,000.   The GAO said that in its survey, which covered the last quarterof 1988, 42 agencies reported that they had not named any politicalappointees to career positions.   Eighteen agencies reported 64 such appointments, 29 of which hadactually been made earlier but not reported, said the GAO, aninvestigative arm of Congress.   Fifty-three of the appointments were made competitively and 11were noncompetitive, according to the GAO report.   A task force of the National Commission on the Public Service,in a report submitted to members of Congress on Tuesday, said,``The more of these (mid-level management) positions that areconverted to political appointments, the more civil servants areforced to recognize that they are in dead-end career tracks.''   In the report it submitted to the president, the commission saidfederal civilian employment ``has held remarkably steady over thepast three decades, even as the number of presidential appointeeshas doubled, then doubled again.''   ``There is growing evidence ... that excessive numbers ofpresidential appointees may actually undermine effectivepresidential control of the executive branch,'' the commission said.</TEXT></DOC>
