But it doesn't helpthe forests much, speakers at an international conference on geologysaid Wednesday.   Thomas Paces, a scientist with the geological survey agency inCzechoslovakia, said in his country miles of dying spruce foreststhat receive acid rain are being treated with tons of calciumcitrate, a type of lime, dumped from helicopters.   ``We are spreading tons of calcium citrate per hectare,'' saidPaces, a delegate to the 28th International Geological Congress.``But recovery (of the forests) has been very poor.''   Paces said the major problem in his country and in Poland andHungary is sulfur oxides in the atmosphere from the burning of coal.The oxides combine with water, falling as rain or snow and addingacidity to the soil.   Paces said thousands of acres of spruce forests are dying.   ``You can see spruce forests on mountains turning yellow,'' hesaid. ``Large areas of spruce are deforested today due to acidrain.''   More than a century of emissions from coal-burning plants inEurope, said Paces, has slowly caused the soil to turn acidic and isnow taking its toll on plants.   ``The damage goes unseen for many, many years,'' he said. ``Bythe time you can see it in trees, it's very difficult (to correct).The problems go on for many, many years.''   Using lime to battle the acid problems is not a good solution,said Paces, noting: ``It is very, very expensive and it has to berepeated every four years.''   Though some theories have been put forward to account fo acidicdamage, most U.S. forest scientists are not convinced that acidityitself harms trees directly, though other forms of common airpollution do. Sulfur oxides themselves are highly toxic, and killtrees on direct impact in high concentrations.   Owen P. Bricker of the U.S. Geological Survey said that liminghas been tried to a limited degree in this country, but he warnedthat treating acid rain problems with neutralizing chemicals ``isaddictive. Once you've started, you've got to keep doing up.''   Most U.S. liming has been aimed at reducing the acidity of lakesreceiving acid rain.   Bricker said Sweden is now spending $10 million a year to addlime to some 5,000 lakes.   Paces, Bricker and others attending the conference said the onlytrue solution to acid rain is to reduce or eliminate the emissionsthat cause it.   In central Europe, said Paces, acid rain should be reducedsharply in 30 years when the supply of coal runs out.   Bricker said that the test stations established on streams in theU.S. Northeast have shown that the natural aquatic systems recoverquickly when sulfuric acid falling on them is reduced.   Bricker said there remains in the U.S. a need to understand morethoroughly how geology affects the acid rain problem.   Some rock formations, such as limestone, will neutralize theacidic rainfal naturally, while other rock types, such as quartz andgranite, react very little. As a result, said Bricker, water passingthrough quartz and granite formations would tend to create more acidlakes and streams.   ``Local geology is complex and can have great effect'' on theamount of environmental damage caused by acid rain, said Bricker,and this is not now being taken into account by federal governmentstudies of the nation's acid rain problems.</TEXT></DOC>
