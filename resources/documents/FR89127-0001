The Final Regulatory Impact Analysisdescribing the options considered in developing this rule amendment isavailable on request from the above named individual.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> This rule is issued in conformity withExecutive Order 12291, Federal Regulation. This action will not (1) havean annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) result ina major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) result in significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investmentor productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Therefore, this rule has been determined to be ``not major.''This action does not fall within the scope of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct. REA has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not representa major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C.4321 <T3>et seq.</T3> (1976)) and, therefore, does not require an environmentalimpact statement or an environmental assessment.This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance underNo. 10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees, and 10.852, RuralTelephone Bank Loans. For the reasons set forth in the final rule relatedNotice to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V (50 FR 47034, November 14, 1985),this program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 whichrequires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.The reporting and record keeping provisions of the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507 <T3>et seq.</T3>) contained in this rule have been approved by the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB) under clearance number 0572-0064.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average .9 of an hour per response, including the time for reviewinginstructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintainingthe data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Department of Agriculture, Clearance Officer, OIRM, Room 404-W, Washington,DC 20250; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, ATTN:Desk Officer for REA, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The following existing REA Bulletins contain the present policies, requirements,and procedures for providing architectural and engineering services forREA telephone borrowers:<ITAG tagnum="16">340-1 Final Payments to Contractors, Engineers, and Architects-TelephoneProgram</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">341-1 Final Statement of Engineering Fee and Certificate of Engineer,Telephone Engineering Service Contract</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">341-3 Engineering Services for Telephone Borrowers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">342-1 Architectural Services for Telephone Borrowers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">380-3 Weekly Progress Report of Telphone Construction and EngineeringServices</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">387-3 Final Documents Required to Close Out Construction of Buildings_TelephoneProgram.</ITAG>These Bulletins contain certain policies, requirements, and proceduresthat are incorporated into this 7 CFR Part 1763 and other CFR Parts. Whenthese CFR Parts are published as final rules, the above Bulletins willbe rescinded.On July 29, 1988, REA published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> Proposed Rule 7 CFR Part 1763, Architecturaland Engineering Services_Telephone Program, containing the provisions regardingarchitectural and engineering services performed by or for REA telephoneborrowers. In the proposed rule REA invited interested parties to filecomments on or before August 29, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>Comments and recommendations were received from the Association of CommunicationEngineers (ACE), representing 36 engineering firms actively engaged inproviding engineering services to REA telephone borrowers; Reed Veach,Wurdeman and Associates (RVW), a consulting engineering firm providingengineering services to several REA telephone borrowers; ATandamp;T NetworkSystems; National Telephone Cooperative Association (NTCA); and filingas a group, the United States Telephone Association (USTA), the NationalRural Telcom Association (NRTA), and the Organization for the Protectionand Advancement of Small Telephone Companies (OPASTCO). The comments andrecommendations are summarized as follows:Section 1763.1 General.USTA, NRTA and OPASTCO stated that (1) the Proposed Rule would restrictfunding for a purpose permitted by the Rural Electrification Act; (2) manyrequirements are placed inappropriately on engineers and architects wherethey should be placed on borrowers; (3) the rule perpetuates nonregulatorylanguage directly from REA Bulletins; and (4) in order for the public tohave an opportunity to thoroughly review and comment on REA's regulations,a 60-day comment period should be granted.<T3>Response.</T3> The language of this regulation merely reflects theprovisions of 7 CFR Part 1745 with respect to the criteria for loan purposesor amounts of funds to be included in a loan and does not independentlyrestrict these purposes. This regulation addresses only the provisionsof architectural and engineering services for the purposes provided forin approved loans.Regarding the second comment, the wording in several sections has beenchanged to place the requirements on the borrowers and not on the architectsand engineers. As to the third point, appropriate explantatory and advisorylanguage has been retained in the Final Rule. REA believes such informationis helpful to borrowers, improves communications, and enhances programadministration. Regarding the fourth point, a 30-day comment period wasused because of the deadline imposed by the Omnibus Budget ReconciliationAct of 1987. REA continued to accept comments after the 30-day period.1763.1(b)_RVW recommended that engineers performing services for REA borrowers,whether by contract or by force account, meet applicable State registrationand licensing requirements.<T3>Response:</T3> For many years telephone borrowers with qualified employeeshave been permitted to provide engineering services by the force accountmethod for facilities financed with REA loan funds. The results have beensatisfactory. The Final Rule sets forth experience requirements for borrowers'employees that will ensure continued satisfactory engineering servicesby the force account method.  Regarding architects and engineers hired under contract by borrowers, USTA,NRTA, and OPASTCO commented that the Proposed Rule imposes registrationand licensing requirements on these architects and engineers, whereas itshould require borrowers that employ architects and engineers under contractto employ only those who meet the specified requirements.  <T3>Response:</T3> REA agrees, and andSection; 1763.1 (c) and (d) have beenworded to place the requirement upon the borrower.   Section 1763.1(c)_USTA, NRTA, and OPASTCO stated that the requirement foran architect on all building projects financed with loan funds places unnecessaryburdens on borrowers and that REA should list the types of building projectsthat are exempt from this requirement.  <T3>Response:</T3> REA agrees, and has added a new paragraph andSection;1763.1(d) listing the types of building construction that will requireprofessional architectual or engineering services.Section 1763.2 Definitions.   USTA, NRTA, and OPASTCO commented that the definition of ``Project'' isnot clear and the term ``rural telephone system'' is not defined in theRural Electrification Act (the Act).  <T3>Response:</T3> The definition of ``Project'' has been clarified inthe Final Rule and the term ``rural telephone system'' has been deleted.Section 1763.4 List of engineers.   USTA, NRTA, and OPASTCO commented that informing the public that REA keepsa list of participating engineers could suggest that borrowers limit theirchoices to those on the list.  <T3>Comment:</T3> REA is discontinuing the list.Section 1763.5 Insurance requirements.   USTA, NRTA, and OPASTCO proposed certain changes in the language requiringarchitects and engineers performing work for borrowers to meet certaininsurance requirements.  <T3>Response:</T3> 7 CFR Part 1788, which has been in effect since July17, 1986, sets forth the insurance coverages which borrowers must requirebe maintained by contractors performing work on REA-financed construction.REA has added paragraph andSection; 1763.4 to the Final Rule to require borrowersto employ only those architects and engineers who have and maintain suchinsurance coverages. Section 1763.21 Architectual services contract.   RVW commented that there is a conflict between andSection; 1763.2(a) of theProposed Rule and the existing REA policy in Bulletins 341-3 and 342-1,which permits using either Form 165 or Form 217 for architectual servicesfor unattended central office buildings. <T3>Response:</T3> The Final Rule has been revised to permit the use ofeither Form 165 or Form 217 for architectural services for unattended centraloffice buildings.   USTA, NRTA, and OPASTCO objected to all ``advisory'' sections of the CFR,suggesting that advice should not be contained in a regulation. Specificallymentioned were REA's suggestion that borrowers obtain legal counsel toensure modified contracts are properly prepared and executed and that borrowersreach written agreements with architects for preliminary services requiredprior to REA approval of the Form 165 contract.  <T3>Response:</T3> REA is committed to the elimination of unnecessary requirementsand advice to borrowers. REA believes, however, that it is appropriateto include advice in regulations when it will improve communications, preventproblems, or otherwise further effective program administration. The advicefor legal counsel is retained in the Final Rule, but the advice on a writtenagreement with the architect for preliminary services has been deleted.  USTA, NRTA, and OPASTCO commented that if it is REA's intent for formsto contain requirements under the regulation, the forms should be publishedwith the relevant rule or incorporated by reference to permit public noticeand opportunity for comment. The comment specifically concerned the Form165 Contract.  <T3>Response:</T3> REA believes it more appropriate to publish all of itsforms under one CFR, rather than have them scattered throughout many sections.Therefore, REA contract forms have been published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> under 7 CFR Part 1762. Specifications and drawingsto be made a part of the contract are incorporated by reference in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> under 7 CFR Part 1772.   In andSection; 1763.21(b) of the Final Rule, the term ``required'' has beenchanged to ``set forth'' to reflect REA's intent that any modificationto Form 165 not affect the contractual obligations of the architect asset forth in the form.Section 1763.22 Closeout of architectual services contract.   USTA, NRTA, and OPASTCO commented that the Proposed Rule places the requirementfor obtaining REA Form 284, Final Statement of Architectual Fees, on thearchitect, rather than on the borrower.  <T3>Response:</T3> The Final Rule places the requirement on the borrowerto obtain the completed Form 284 from the architect.   RVW commented there is a conflict between andSection;andSection; 1763.21(c)and 1763.42(a) concerning the submission of contracts to REA.  <T3>Response:</T3> The review by the GFR is essential for the approvalof contracts. Section 1763.21(c) in the Final Rule has been revised torequire submission of the REA Form 165 contracts to REA through the GFR.Section 1763.40 Preloan engineering.   Paragraph (a)_USTA, NRTA, and OPASTCO objected to advising borrowers todiscuss their proposed method of obtaining preloan engineering serviceswith the GFR before proceeding.<T3>Response:</T3> REA believes that discussion with the GFR will oftenminimize the burden on borrowers and has retained the advisory languagein the Final Rule.   Paragraph (b)_USTA, NRTA, and OPASTCO objected to REA suggesting that Form835 be used for contracting preloan engineering services.<T3>Response:</T3> In many cases, following this advice will minimize problemsfor borrowers. The advisory language is retained in the Final Rule.Section 1763.41 Preloan engineering procedures.   USTA, NRTA, and OPASTCO commented that andSection; 1763.41(a), referringto the borrower's selection of a preloan engineer, and andSection; 1763.41(c),referring to requesting an advance to cover the cost of preloan engineeringservices, impose no requirements and should be stricken from the regulation.<T3>Response:</T3> These items have been deleted in the Final Rule.NTCA commented that the acronym FRS needs to be defined.The Final Rule contains a definition for FRS in andSection; 1763.2.Section 1763.42 Postloan engineering by contract.Paragraph (a)_RVW commented that the requirement to submit the REA Form217, Postloan Engineering Service Contract, through the GFR adds one totwo weeks or more to the time to process the contracts.<T3>Response: </T3>Since the GFR has firsthand knowledge of the project,his review is essential for approval of the contracts. The requirementhas been retained.ATandamp;T Network Systems commented that the requirement for postloan engineeringservices by contract to be on REA Form 217, Postloan Engineering ServiceContract, subject to REA approval, and where REA may withhold approvalif the form is modified, is not conducive to flexibility and freedom tostructure business arrangements.<T3>Response: </T3>There are many reasons for using standard forms of contract.Standard forms comply with the rules and regulations of the various Governmententities administering the use of Government-provided funds. They provideessential security for the REA loans. All parties are familiar with them.They are readily accepted in all States and territories where REA telephoneborrowers are located, and by the contractors. Their use has promoted efficientand economical facilities to the benefit of the rural subscribers. Theuse of nonstandard contracts could lessen these benefits and increase thecomplexity and cost of program administration, resulting in delays.Paragraph (b)_RVW commented that the requirement that a letter be sentto REA giving the name of the firm and the name and license number of theindividual who will sign the work order certification is unnecessary.<T3>Response: </T3>REA agrees. The Final Rule does not contain the requirementfor this letter.Section 1763.43 Postloan engineering by force account.Paragraph (a)_ACE recommended that REA require professional registrationfor new applicants seeking approval to perform force account engineering,but that REA allow all borrowers' employees whom REA has previously approvedto direct force account engineering activities to continue in this capacity.RVW commented that procedures would be streamlined and made administrativelymanageable by requiring that borrowers' engineers receive State registrationbefore they may perform force account engineering.<T3>Response: </T3>REA believes that an alternative to requiring Stateregistration should be retained for those directing force account engineering.REA's experience with nonregistered engineers in this capacity has beensatisfactory. The alternative qualifications have been retained in theFinal Rule.Section 1763.44 Loan funds for engineering services.RVW commented that andSection; 1763.1(g) states that REA approval of Form245, Engineering Service Contract, Special Services_Telephone, is not required,but that andSection; 1763.44(e) implies that approval is required in orderfor the borrower to obtain loan funds.<T3>Response: </T3>REA approval of the Form 245 contract is not required.REA funds, if provided in the loan for this purpose, will be advanced uponthe submission of the final invoice from the engineer. Section 1763.44(e)has been deleted.USTA, NRTA, and OPASTCO commented that andSection; 1763.44(a) is an attemptto codify REA behavior which could be arbitrary and capricious.<T3>Response: </T3>REA will make loan funds available up to the amountsprovided in the loan for these purposes, if all of the conditions for advancehave been met as discussed in 7 CFR Part 1754. Section 1763.43 has beenclarified and portions that duplicated 7 CFR Part 1754 have been deleted.Section 1763.45 Engineering progress reports.RVW agreed with the concept of progress and status reports but felt therequirements for the engineer should be in the REA Form 217 Postloan EngineeringServices Contract, not in the Part 1763 regulation.<T3>Response: </T3>REA states its requirements for borrowers in these regulations.The contract forms contain the borrower's requirements of contractors.It is REA's intent to require the borrower to obtain progress reports,so that requirement must be in this regulation.USTA, NRTA, and OPASTCO commented that the borrower should be requiredto obtain the reports, rather than requiring the engineer to provide them.They also questioned whether the progress reports should cover only outsideplant construction.<T3>Response: </T3>The Final Rule contains revised language in andSection;1763.44 (a) and (b), which clarifies that progress reports are requiredfor all telephone facilities.Section 1763.45 Closeout of the postloan engineering contract.RVW commented that upon REA approval of Form 506, Final Statement of EngineeringFee, one copy should be sent to the borrower and one copy to the engineer.USTA, NRTA, and OPASTCO commented that this provision should be rewordedto place on the borrower the requirement for obtaining Form 506.<T3>Response: </T3>REA agrees with both comments. Final Rule andSection;1763.45(a) requires the borrower to obtain the REA Form 506 from the engineer.Section 1763.45(c) requires REA to send one copy of Form 506 to the borrowerand one copy to the engineer after approval by REA.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1763</ITAG>Loan programs_communications, Telecommunications, Telephone.Therefore, REA adds new Part 1763 to 7 CFR Chapter XVII as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 1763_ARCHITECTURAL AND ENGINEERING SERVICES_TELEPHONE PROGRAM</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1763.1 General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1763.2 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1763.3 Availability of REA forms.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1763.4 Insurance requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1763.5 Payments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1763.6 1763.19 [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Architectural Services</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1763.20 Selection of architects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1763.21 Architectural services contract.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1763.22 Closeout of architectural services contract.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1763.23 1763.39 [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Engineering Services</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1763.40 Preloan engineering.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1763.41 Postloan engineering by contract.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1763.42 Postloan engineering by force account.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1763.43 Loan funds for engineering services.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1763.44 Engineer's progress reports.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1763.45 Closeout of the postloan engineering service contract.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1763.46 1763.99 [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>7 U.S.C. 901 <T3>et seq.</T3>, 7 U.S.C. 1921 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="56">Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1763.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General.</ITAG>(a) The standard REA Loan Documents (<T3>See</T3> 7 CFR Part 1758) contain provisions regarding engineeringand architectural services performed by or for REA telephone borrowers.This part implements certain of the provisions by setting forth the requirementsand procedures to be followed by borrowers in selecting architects andengineers and obtaining architectural and engineering services by contractor by force account.(b) Preloan architectural and engineering services may be provided by qualifiedpersonnel on the borrower's staff or by consultants. Neither the selectionof a preloan architect or engineer by a borrower, nor the contractual arrangementswith them, requires REA approval.(c) Postloan architectural and engineering services shall be obtained byborrowers from registered architects and engineers licensed in the Statein which the facilities will be located, except where REA has approvedthe borrower to provide these services by the force account method. Whenthe extent of the proposed major or minor construction is such that thepostloan engineering involved is within the capabilities of employees onthe borrower's staff, the borrower may request REA approval to providesuch services. This method of providing engineering services is referredto as force account engineering. Refer to andSection; 1763.42.(d) To be considered for REA financing, the following contract requirementsmust be met for postloan architectural and engineering services:(1) For major construction, services provided by architects and engineersnot on the borrower's staff must be provided under Form 165, ArchitecturalServices Contract_Telephone, or Form 217, Postloan Engineering ServiceContract_Telephone. These contracts require REA approval.(2) For minor construction, borrowers may use the contracts in andSection;1763.1(d)(1) for postloan architectural or engineering services or anyother form of contract, such as Form 245, Engineering Service Contract,Special Services_Telephone.
