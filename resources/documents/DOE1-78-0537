The depth of the band's centre isjust below the original amorphous/crystalline interface. The ion bombardmentsimulation computer program TRIM.CASCADE has been used in conjunctionwith ion channelling measurements to predict the areal density of atomsavailable for the formation of this band of disorder. The variation inthe amounts of disorder expected due to changing the implantation parameters:ion dose, ion energy and implantation temperature are reported. The predictionsare compared with the published transmission electron microscopy resultsand electrical measurements of other workers. The implications of thiswork for the technique of pre-amorphisation are also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
