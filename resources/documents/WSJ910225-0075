Many canes are so ugly that people who need them won't usethem. Or canes are too long or short, or have uncomfortablehandles. &quot;A cane's like a shoe,&quot; says Margaret Wylde, vicepresident of the Institute for Technology Development inOxford, Miss. &quot;It's necessary, but you still want it to lookand fit great.&quot;   Jerry Phillips of Plantation, Fla., had an elderly friendwho was afraid to go out at night because she couldn't seesteps or curbs. Mr. Phillips, retired from the restaurantbusiness, has designed an adjustable aluminum cane with afluorescent light near the tip. His Light-A-Cane is poweredby four AA batteries, has a handle sculpted to fit the handand comes in blue or black.   Canes have a way of being in the way when not in use.Innovatex Research andamp; Development of Laval, Quebec, hasinvented a telescoping cane that can be collapsed to 22inches or extended to 40. A series of holes along the back ofthe cane can be blocked or left open to allow an automaticreturn to the correct length. The Klick cane comes in sixcolors.   Canes can serve more than one purpose. The Helper is acane and a reaching device. Conceived by Anderson DesignAssociates in Farmington, Conn., it can grasp things normallybeyond reach, including items on the floor. When the Helperis gripped at the trigger point, the curved, padded handlebraces the cane against the forearm, allowing the user tolift heavy objects.   The better-looking the cane, the more likely its use, saysHouse of Canes andamp; Walkingsticks, Wilderville, Ore. Owner MarkFontaine makes canes out of fine hardwoods, with filigreebrass bands and handles that include water buffalo horn,carved in the shape of animals.                                                                                                          Hold On While We   Download Our Guidebook                                                                                                          FLOPHOUSES on floppies? Guidebooks are turning up incomputers.   Two British companies, Triangle Interactive Publicationsand TimeOut Publications, have produced a guide to London ona computer disk for International Business Machines personalcomputers and their clones. A disk-based guide to New York isdue out late this month, to be followed this spring by Paris,Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Las Vegas.   The London guide has information on hotels, activities forchildren, eating and drinking, entertainment, gay and lesbianlife, health, museums and galleries, night life, services,shopping, sightseeing, sports and fitness, students andtransportation.   Triangle managing director Peter Mackeonis, who operatesfrom Rio del Mar, Calif., says the computerized guides willbe especially useful to businessmen who carry laptopcomputers when they travel. &quot;The disks won't replaceguidebooks per se,&quot; says Mr. Mackeonis. &quot;But they can giveyou swifter information.&quot;   The London disk contains the equivalent of about 30 pagesof printed information. If people like the initial guides,&quot;far more heavyweight&quot; versions -- with maps, photos anddisplay advertising -- will start appearing in the fall, Mr.Mackeonis promises.                                                                                                          Highway Noise Buffers   Take On New Looks                                                                                                          SOME HIGHWAY sound barriers get a face lift.   More than 700 miles of walls have been built in the U.S.,at a cost exceeding $500 million, to protect communities fromtraffic noise. States hope to spend almost $1 billion more on&quot;noise walls&quot; in the next five years.   The first noise walls were starkly functional: plainmetal, masonry, cement or wood. But highway engineers andlandscape architects now think more about form. &quot;The countryis moving on to more sophisticated designs and improvedaesthetics,&quot; says Domenick Billera, chairman of the noisecommittee of the Transportation Research Board, part of theNational Academy of Sciences.   To screen Philadelphia's Chinatown from the new VineStreet Expressway, landscape architects at Synterra designeda colonial-style red brick wall, capped with limestone anddecorated with Chinese medallions and calligraphy.Pennsylvania installed 800 feet of Evergreen Wall -- precastconcrete forms holding earth and plants -- along a stretch ofInterstate 476 near its junction with I-95, south ofPhiladelphia. The state is building more of the walls, whichwere pioneered in Switzerland, farther north on I-476.   Tried-and-true concrete gets dressier. New Jersey plans atree pattern on the back of a noise wall between a school andRoute 9 in Sayreville. Arizona paints Indian symbols onconcrete-block noise barriers in Phoenix.   Mr. Billera, a New Jersey state environmental engineer,sees &quot;a lot of blank canvases out there&quot; and proposes adesign competition to fill them.</TEXT></DOC>
