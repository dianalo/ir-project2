Stalin to hide millionsof deaths caused by his policies.   Demographer Mark Tolts said the census showed a population of162 million, the official Tass news agency said.   The weekly magazine Ogonyok, in a story about the censuspublished in December, said Stalin claimed a population in 1937 of170 million even though statistics could not confirm it.   Tolts did not say where the census results were found, and saidit was too early to use its figures to estimate how many peopledied in the purges, collectivization of agriculture and forcedindustrialization Stalin imposed in the 1930s.   Current Soviet reference books put the population at 163 millionfor 1917, the year of the revolution that brought the Bolsheviks topower. The current population is 284 million.   Ogonyok blamed many of the deaths on a famine forced upon ruralresidents by government grain requisitions, but Tolts said Stalin'srepressive policies also apparently were to blame.   He said the population of the Saratov region on the Volga Riversoutheast of Moscow declined by 20 percent between 1927 and 1937,and the population of the Kursk region south of Moscow declined by14 percent in the same period.   Stalin told a Communist Party congress in 1934 that the Sovietpopulation the previous year was 168 million, although censusofficials put the figure at 165.7 million and one scientist put itas low as 158 million.</TEXT></DOC>
