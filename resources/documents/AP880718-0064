I'll just tryto communicate and deliver a message,'' she said after a Sundaytraining session at the Omni convention hall.   Today, in an interview on NBC-TV, she said, ``The keynote, Ithink, is the person who just sort of opens the door and says,`Come on in,' and that's what I hope I can do tonight: Talk aboutwho I am, where I came from, where I think the country has been andinvite the public to join us.''   Ms. Richards said she felt she was picked as the keynote speakerbecause she is from Texas, is a woman and ``I hope because I canmake a good speech.''   Her nationally televised speech will key on families, she said.   ``It's not a party issue,'' the divorced mother of four said,adding, however, that ``the past eight years of Republicanadministration has made it harder on family life.''   Ms. Richards, who as state treasurer handles more than $150billion worth of transactions a year, said, ``Managing a house isprobably the greatest managememt training in the world. You'rejuggling lives. You've got to do it on time. You've got to bringpeople to a consensus. You have to allow everyone to save face. Allthe decisions have to be decisions that make everyone happy. Ithink I bring that to my job.''   But she said her training and long history of public speakinghave not kept the butterflies away.   ``I'm terribly nervous. I'm sure I'll just be a jittering foolby the time I'm supposed to go on,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
