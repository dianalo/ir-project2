These diagnostics consist of several types,namely: K{alpha} x-ray pinhole cameras, a multiframe dE/dx ion pinholecamera, a p-i-n array ion pinhole camera, Thomson parabola spectrographs,a Rutherford magnetic spectrograph, plasma visible spectroscopy, andseveral nuclear activation diagnostics. These components, when takentogether, enable a rather thorough description of the 5-MV, 10-TW ionbeams presently being produced. A unique feature of these diagnosticsis that they are capable of operating in hard (several MeV) x-ray bremsstrahlungbackgrounds of some 10{sup 9}--10{sup 10} rad/s. Details of each diagnostic,its integration, data reduction procedures, and recent PBFA-II data willbe discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
