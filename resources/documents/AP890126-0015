Israeli security forces Tuesday arrested dozens of peoplesuspected of belonging to the alleged army.   Some Palestinians say the ``popular army'' is an attempt tocoordinate groups of activists who enforce general strikes, patrolneighborhoods and punish collaborators in the 13-month uprisingagainst Israeli rule of the occupied territories.   Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab said Tuesday that Israel wasblowing the significance of the issue out of proportion for itspublicity value.   ``It's a game of semantics,'' he said of the term ``populararmy.''   Kuttab, who has wide contacts in the Palestine LiberationOrganization, called existing groups of activists ``strike forces''that use stones, not guns, in their clashes with Israeli soldiers.   In announcing Tuesday's arrests, Israeli military officials saidthe ``popular army'' was led by Fatah, Arafat's arm of the PLO.   Israel claims Arafat lied when, as part of a diplomaticinitiative, he said last month that the PLO renounced terrorism andrecognized the Jewish state.   The key suspect in the arrests, Abdel Fatah Hassan, receivedweapons and money from Fatah and trained dozens of youths forattacks against Israeli troops and civilians, Israel radio said.   The squads were based in the town of Tulkarem in theIsraeli-occupied West Bank and were to train ``hundreds of others''in the territory, according to the radio.   An Israeli army spokesman said he did not know what kind ofweapons were involved.   An army official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said thePLO continually tries to smuggle money and arms into the West Bankand occupied Gaza Strip.   The official said he did not know the size and scope of activityof the ``popular army,'' but that the Israeli army did not see it asa sign that the Palestinian uprising was becoming an armed struggle.   A recent PLO statement said the ``popular army'' was being formedunder the auspices of Fatah's Force-17 and had thousands of membersin the occupied lands.   A leaflet circulated last week announced the formation of the``Palestinian Popular Army'' and urged attacks on Israeli soldiersand Jewish settlers.   Still, there have been no indications of an armed military forcein the occupied lands since the rebellion began in December 1987.   In recent months, Palestinian youths, often wearing identicaljackets or black, plastic garbage bags done up as ponchos havestaged ``military marches'' in towns and villages. Some were armedwith clubs, slingshots and hatchets.   One such march took place Jan. 1 in the village of Abu Falah onthe West Bank. Residents said 300 to 400 youths took part, and drew2,500 spectators in the local schoolyard.   A video of the parade viewed by The Associated Press showedyouths carrying outlawed Palestinian flags. Marchers wore keffiyehs,the checkered Arab headdress considered a symbol of Palestiniannationalism, but the youths were not dressed uniformly. Some werepre-teens who appeared to be playing soldier games.   Three TV crews reportedly filmed the parade, and residentssprayed slogans in English and Hebrew on walls near the schoolyard,apparently for the benefit of the journalists. A Hebrew slogan read:``Long live Abu Amar,'' Arafat's code name.   Kuttab and other Palestinians said such military posturing didnot mean a real Palestinian army existed. ``This is more of asymbolic gesture'' to keep up morale among residents, he said.   Some Palestinians suggested, however, that improved coordinationamong strike forces could serve as the seed for a broad-basedguerrilla force if the uprising drags on.   Some PLO factions in the underground Unified National Leadershipof the Uprising reportedly oppose the notion of a ``popular army,''arguing it would only serve as propaganda fodder for the Israelisand possibly provoke Israeli reprisals.   If there was feuding over the issue, the opponents appear to havewon.   Kuttab noted that no mention of the ``popular army'' was made inthe Unified Leadership's latest leaflet, which was circulated Mondayin the occupied lands.</TEXT></DOC>
