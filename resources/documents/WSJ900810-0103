Some even assert the racist argument that perhapsGuatemalans simply aren't capable of handling democracy.   What these analysts are ignoring is that the policies thatthey themselves have advocated (and very often imposed) inthe name of &quot;democracy&quot; have been neither democratic norenriching for any except the few local proxies who mouth whatoutsiders want to hear. Now that these proxies have beenexposed as inept in all matters save corruption, the peoplewant to throw them out and turn to the so-called hard-liners-- not in a military coup, mind you, but in an open election.And the &quot;civilized&quot; world is aghast.</LP><TEXT>   When Latin American independence was declared, most of ourterritories remained under the influence of the motherlandfor several decades. This situation would have been justifiedfor a short period of time until the right concept of arepublic was found and established in each particularterritory. But it so happened that domination lasted for manydecades with disastrous results.   In these times, foreign hegemony comes from anunchallenged determination of the First World countries toimpose on Third World nations their own vision of ademocratic system. If we fail to make the passing grade --that is, if those approved of by the foreign &quot;experts&quot; arenot elected or reelected -- the penalty is applied: mediacondemnation followed by isolation.   Local Christian Democrats and Socialists share a statistvision of governing and are usually the only candidates foroffice acceptable to the outsiders. They are financed byforeign funds sent by political organizations abroad. Thistype of financing -- massive by local standards -- has oftenoverwhelmed other candidates and determined the final resultof elections. The definition of democracy then boils down tothe single act of electing a leader propped up with foreignfunding. Democracy does not become a process by which mengovern, but a license to do whatever the elected want oncethey're in office. And in these circumstances, the road topower is opened to some of the worst elements in oursocieties.   Illegal activities -- even including drug trafficking andrelated activities -- carried out by those in power havebecome an everyday problem here. Unfortunately, most of ourlegal institutions do not provide a procedure by which anelected president can be separated from power through a legalaction, except in the event of mental illness. Officials canmismanage public funds, act irresponsibly or promote achaotic situation for the whole nation, but the citizens areunable to make them accountable. A &quot;Watergate&quot; is notpossible in a country like Guatemala, though much worseevents have taken place during the administration ofChristian Democrat Vinicio Cerezo.   And all these abuses have taken place at the expense ofthe poorest people, in whose interests the &quot;acceptable&quot;democrats claim to govern. A litany of just some of theirabuses and the consequent results follows:   -- They stress the importance of paying taxes but evadetheir own contribution through an additional stipend called&quot;confidenciales&quot; (confidential expenditures); money that isgranted without having to justify how it was spent. PresidentCerezo received last year the amount of 180 million quetzalesfrom such an account; in 1988 the amount came to 150 million,though he recently insisted on local television that arealistic figure was closer to &quot;just&quot; 100 million quetzales(equal to about $25 million).   -- The foreign minister, aside from his salary,representation expenses and confidenciales, received $1,000per diem no matter where he spent his working days.   -- Donations and loans coming from the U.S. governmentthrough the Agency for International Development have beengrossly mishandled. More than $2 million are unacounted forin funds given by AID, which would have benefited childrenseverely affected by malnutrition and illnesses.   -- The quetzal has reached a point of devaluation almostas low as it was before this government took over. It is nowevident that an artificial stabilization had been achievedthrough the assistance provided by the U.S. and some Europeangovernments that support the Christian Democrats in CentralAmerica. Even then, all the external aid and financing havenot been enough to cover up this government's excessivespending habits. One dollar was worth 3.78 quetzales lastOctober. Now the value has gone down to 4.35 and is still onits way down, even though the amount of dollars incirculation is at its peak this time of the year when paymentof our most important export goods takes place.   -- The fiscal deficit increased three times from 1985 to1988, and by 1990 it became the highest in the history of thecountry. Per-capita income has dropped in real terms to its1969 level. According to statistics supplied by Asazgua, theprivate association of sugar planters, the price of basicproducts consumed by Guatemalans -- black beans, corn andrice -- has increased more than 500% from 1985 to 1990. Thatmeans most of the population is far poorer that it wasthroughout all the years when the government was controlledby the authoritarian groups that took power by force.   -- State hospitals, roads and public schools are in ruinsdue to the fact that no money has been spent on theirmaintenance. Paper is used instead of bandages to wipe awayblood during surgery. People die because they lack thenecessary funds to pay for high-priced medicines, which areno longer supplied by the government.   Of course we do have a new class of millionaires -- thosepart-time socialists and part-time capitalists who arepampered by foreign countries no matter what they do and nomatter how destructive they are so long as they talk prettyand uphold the principle of democracy -- that is, anelection.   Meanwhile, the voters with their simple rationale thinkthat the solution will come from an authoritarian president,who this time might be elected through a democratic process.They hope that this new president will be given the chance towork things out with as much international support as thepopulist demagogues who have governed the country the pastfour and a half years. Can anyone except the mostreality-blind ideologue really blame them?   ---   Ms. Altolaguirre is an attorney, columnist and a professorat the Francisco Marroquin University in Guatemala City.</TEXT></DOC>
