<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-56-0732 </DOCNO><TEXT>Imaging methods used in hepatology are briefly classified and their valuescharacterized. Radioisotope scanning is emphasized as an advantageousscreening method for its ease and high sensitivity. /sup 99/Tc, /sup131/I, /sup 198/Au, /sup 67/Ga are the most frequently used isotope tracers.However, the method has a limited value in focal processes and in hepatocellularprocesses and is disadvantageous for a high proportion of false positiveresults. Computerized tomography is an expensive diagnostic method; however,it is highly accurate - in 90% of cases, it can be used where invasiveexaminations are contraindicated and with the exception of chronic liverdiseases, it can identify processes and anatomical structures in moredetail than any other method. Of other methods used, non-isotope methodsare listed, such as ultrasound scanning, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography,endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
