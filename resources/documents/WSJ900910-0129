The price increases, which are expected before the end ofthe month, are likely to feed inflation and risk triggeringtransport and labor strikes that military rebels couldexploit as a reason for another coup attempt.</LP><TEXT>   Apparently in an effort to damp anticipated protests andshore up eroding support from the non-communist left, Mrs.Aquino has offered to begin talks with the communist-ledNational Democratic Front. The front has yet to reply to Mrs.Aquino's proposal, but NDF officials have been quoted assaying they are interested because of the likely propagandaboost the talks would give to the group's strugglinginsurgency.   Diplomats and analysts, however, worry that Mrs. Aquino'sstrategy could backfire by intensifying right-wing impatiencewith her government at a time when it already is vulnerableto military insurrection.   Fears of another coup attempt have been heightened by the21 bombings that have rocked Manila in the past three weeks,the latest occurring Wednesday night about 500 meters fromthe president's residence. Officials blame the bombings onrebel soldiers, including Gregorio &quot;Gringo&quot; Honasan, leaderof three previous coup attempts, including one last December.   Talk of a coup dominates local media: Columnists writethat they are more concerned with &quot;coup-wait&quot; than Kuwait.And though few people openly call for a military uprising,many say they are deeply disappointed by Mrs. Aquino'sfailure to make full use of the tremendous prestige shegarnered when she was swept to power in a February 1986popular revolt that ended 21 years of corrupt rule byFerdinand Marcos.   &quot;In the Marcos years, there was no hope. She (Mrs. Aquino)offered hope in the beginning, but now the mood is turningblack,&quot; says Luis Virata, managing director of ExchangeCapital Corp., an investment-advisory affiliate of JardineFleming Holdings Ltd. &quot;There is a crisis of confidence.&quot;   Mr. Virata says he is worried less about the bombs --which have caused heavy damage but relatively few injuries --than about the government's failure to ensure such basicservices as garbage collection, electricity and floodcontrol. &quot;Government is not doing its job,&quot; he says.   Last month, monsoon rains twice flooded Manila, paralyzingthe city and killing about 25 people. The floods wereworsened by uncollected garbage that clogged the city's stormdrains. Thousands of slum dwellers were left homeless.   Disappointment with Mrs. Aquino's government cuts acrossclass lines. Ronnie Graga, a 25-year-old security guard, sayshe has seen &quot;no improvement&quot; since Mrs. Aquino came to power.&quot;We were not fortunate in Marcos's time, and we are notfortunate in Cory's time,&quot; he says. &quot;With oil prices goingup, I can only imagine that life will get worse.&quot;   Supporters of Mrs. Aquino say she has survived challengesthat could have toppled a more experienced leader. Since theDecember coup attempt, the sixth during Mrs. Aquino'spresidency, the Philippines has been battered by drought anda devastating earthquake, as well as the floods.   Meanwhile, the army is fighting a rebellion on thesouthern island of Mindanao, where Alexander Noble, a formerpresidential security chief, is leading animist tribesagainst the government. According to local press reports,more than 8,000 people have been displaced since the campaignbegan in mid-August.   Last week, Sen. John Osmena, a former supporter of Mrs.Aquino, urged the president to dismiss her cabinet and passexecutive power to an ad hoc committee that would managestate affairs until a new president is elected in 1992. Asexpected, Mrs. Aquino scorned the suggestion, asserting thather government will withstand both military threats and a&quot;constitutional coup&quot; such as that proposed by Sen. Osmena.Few took the senator's suggestion seriously, but the exchangehighlighted the extent to which support for Mrs. Aquino hascrumbled.   In such an environment, the president now must pushthrough a fuel price increase opposed by organized labor andmany of the grass-roots groups that helped bring her topower.   The left-leaning Kilusang Mayo Uno, one of the country'stwo biggest labor federations, has staged rallies against afuel price increase and called for a general strike if fuelprices rise. The comparatively moderate Trade Union Congressof the Philippines also opposes a fuel price adjustment. &quot;Ifoil prices are increased it will cause a chain reaction,&quot;says Avelino Valerio, vice president of the TUCP. &quot;We willhave to demand wage increases.&quot;   There are no official figures on the likely impact ofhigher fuel prices on inflation, which now is running at anannual rate of about 13% and is projected by some seniorgovernment officials to reach 18% by the end of the year.   Inflation aside, a rise in gasoline prices alone risksinflaming one of Manila's most powerful labor groups: driversof the brightly colored jeepneys, the principal means oftransport for most of the capital's residents.   &quot;Our drivers can hardly provide their families with threemeals per day,&quot; says Oscar Lazaro, president of one of thecity's many jeepney drivers associations. &quot;If they (thegovernment) increase the price of oil and gasoline, faresmust go up.&quot; Mr. Lazaro adds that drivers' earnings alreadyhave been trimmed by mounting congestion, which daily bringsManila traffic to a near standstill, reducing the number ofruns per jeepney.   Labor leaders suggest that the government should cushionthe blow of higher oil prices by reducing fuel taxes, whichnow average about 32%, or by suspending payments on thecountry's foreign debt, a course Mrs. Aquino has rejected.   The Philippines depends on petroleum for 65% of its energyneeds and imports nearly all of the 240,000 barrels of crudeit uses each day. Domestic fuel prices are based on acrude-oil price of $16.53 a barrel and an exchange rate of21.9 pesos to the dollar. Since the start of the latestMideast crisis on Aug. 2, crude-oil prices have risen toabout $30 a barrel, while the Philippine currency has fallento nearly 25 pesos to the dollar. During the same period,local fuel prices have remained constant.   The government uses an Oil Price Stabilization Fund tocompensate the three oil companies operating in the countryfor losses by providing a forward cover on exchange rates andsubsidizing the difference between crude-oil prices anddomestic fuel prices. (The oil companies have beenpetitioning the government for fuel price increases.)   The fund was intended as a buffer, to be built up duringtimes of low world oil prices by maintaining relativelyhigher domestic prices. However, Mrs. Aquino and thelegislature authorized a cut in domestic prices last year,after crude prices declined. When crude prices climbed again,the fund quickly fell into deficit.   This year, the government allocated five billion pesos($207 million) to subsidize the fund. The allocation wasquickly exhausted and industry sources estimate that the fundnow owes the oil companies an additional 6.5 billion pesosfor oil already delivered.   Without a price adjustment, the Philippines would owe theoil companies as much as 12 billion pesos by the end of theyear, depending on world crude prices, industry sources says.   Matthijs V.P. Venker, vice president of Pilipinas ShellPetroleum Corp., says officials and the Philippine businesscommunity understand the need for a fuel price increase. &quot;Itis up to them to bite the bullet on this, and the earlierthey bite it the better,&quot; he says, adding that an increaselikely will be announced before the end of the month.   Those who want to see Mrs. Aquino weather her currenttroubles hope that her offer to open talks with thecommunists and other recent efforts to mend fences withgrass-roots groups will ease the way for a price increase.&quot;Labor will be a serious problem if it is not premanaged,&quot;says Melinda Quintos de Jesus, a columnist active in themovement that helped bring Mrs. Aquino to power. Strongleadership could make the difference, she says, but adds thatthere is a growing sense that &quot;the government is beingovertaken by these many crises.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
