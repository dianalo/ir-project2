After the restructuring, the banking concern said it will have between 84.9 million and 109.3 million shares outstanding. It currently has about 9.5 million shares outstanding.    The company said the restructuring will give it primary capital of as much as 12% of assets, compared to 7.71% currently. Like many Southwestern banks, the holding company has been hit hard by the energy and real estate slump, posting a loss of $6.9 million for the first quarter.    Terms of the recapitalization plan call for Banks of Mid-America to swap $41.7 million in 10 3/4% notes for either $28 cash or 26 common shares for each $40 face amount of notes, or a combination of cash and stock.    The company is offering to exchange 4.74 common shares for each share of $2.50 cumulative convertible preferred, 9.47 common shares for each share of adjustable rate cumulative preferred and 18.95 common shares for each share of $9 cumulative convertible preferred.    Banks of Mid-America also said it will offer 60.7 million new common shares to current holders and other investors for $1.24 each. It said some directors and other insiders have agreed to purchase up to $26.4 million of the new shares if necessary to complete the restructuring.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Banks of Mid-America's shares closed at $1, down 12.5 cents.    The recapitalization is contingent on 90% of the debt being swapped and on holders of half the $2.50 preferred and two-thirds of the other two issues approving the exchange. Common shareholders also must approve the plan at a special meeting, tentatively scheduled for late September. </TEXT></DOC>
