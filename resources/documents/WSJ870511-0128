The Coloradan turned to Mr. Babbitt and said, &quot;Bruce, ask him if you can be his second choice.&quot;    With Mr. Hart's withdrawal from the race for the Democratic presidential nomination in the wake of accusations he was a &quot;womanizer,&quot; the scramble is on to win the staff, organizers, contributors and support that the front-runner amassed in two presidential campaigns. &quot;We're going to plow back through everyone who said they were favorable to us but committed to Hart,&quot; says William Carrick, campaign manager for Rep. Richard Gephardt, &quot;and try to get them to go with us.&quot;    At the same time, there is renewed focus on the possibility that political heavyweights outside the race might join the seven current contenders. Both Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York and Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey took themselves out of contention earlier and are repeating their disavowals of interest. Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Armed Services Committee and an important member of the Iran-Contra inquiry, has put off any decision on a presidential drive until later.    The earthquake that toppled the Hart campaign cleared the Democratic landscape, with the result that, as party Chairman Paul Kirk put it, &quot;the new front-runner may not emerge until after the Iowa caucus.&quot; Today the field consists of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Gov. Michael Dukakis, who each won the support of 9% of likely Democratic voters in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll taken last week, and other contenders who together garnered the support of a little more than 10% of the voters polled. No candidate has support registering in double digits.    &quot;This race has had the equivalent of a false start,&quot; says Robert Squier, a Democratic political consultant. &quot;Now we're going to start again.&quot;    As the seven contenders try to capture the 41% of the Democratic support that Mr. Hart claimed last month, the chances grow that the nomination won't be decided for weeks, maybe months, after the &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; round of primaries early next March. Generally, the more protracted the race, the more bitter it becomes, increasing the likelihood that the party will be hurt.    The Democrats, nevertheless, still approach the election year with clear advantages. The Republicans are hurt by the Iran-Contra scandal. Mr. Hart's withdrawal opens the race to a new generation of Democratic leadership at a time when the electorate, after years of impatience with Democrats, looks to them with fresh receptiveness.    As the dust settles from last week's tumult, candidates are struggling to claim the assets of the Hart campaign. Political insiders looked on the Hart staff with envy, and nearly every campaign plans to try to hire some of the experienced political hands who suddenly are in the marketplace.    Paul Tully and Joe Trippi, talented organizers, and Paul Maslin and Harrison Hickman, political pollsters with informal relationships to the Hart camp, are available. One of the most sought-after operatives is Teresa Velmain, Mr. Hart's campaign manager in Iowa, site of the first caucuses. &quot;She's the biggest prize available,&quot; says Bonnie Campbell, chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party.    At the same time, the remaining contenders are hoping to attract the interest of many of the Hart fund-raisers, along with the 100,000 active direct-mail donors in the Hart campaign computers.    Here is how the field is positioned as the struggle for the Hart support gets under way:    --Former Gov. Babbitt of Arizona. The withdrawal of Mr. Hart leaves Mr. Babbitt as the only Westerner in the field. Mr. Babbitt has deployed powerful organizations in Iowa and New Hampshire and will try to attract some of the Hart supporters who feel deeply about issues involving the environment, women and the welfare of children. This week, Mr. Babitt turns up the heat on a statewide advertising campaign that began in Iowa April 30.    --Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware. Like Mr. Hart, the 44-year-old Mr. Biden had been making an appeal to a new generation of Democrats, and now is positioned to win much of the support that was attracted to the Coloradan on the basis of that appeal. Mr. Biden has built up a formidable $2 million war chest, though his fund-raising effort is ahead of his organizational effort. He plans this week to begin an offensive to counteract the notion that his campaign is long on themes and short on specific policies, and in the next two months expects to set out his views on subjects such as the economy and foreign policy.    --Gov. Dukakis of Massachusetts. Mr. Dukakis is the clear beneficiary of Mr. Hart's withdrawal in New Hampshire, where they were virtually tied for the lead in the first presidential primary, with the rest of the field far behind. &quot;There is an unparalleled advantage now to Dukakis here,&quot; says Richard Winters, a Dartmouth College political scientist. Mr. Dukakis is closely identified with Mr. Hart's views on economic growth and free trade and thus may be able to attract some of his support.    --Rep. Gephardt. The St. Louis lawmaker, with a campaign stressing trade issues, was the first second-tier candidate to emerge as a potential challenger to Mr. Hart in the early primary states. Like Mr. Babbitt, Mr. Gephardt has built a strong organization, particularly in Iowa. Now he is talking more intensely to financial backers and appealing to potential donors who were holding back. &quot;The key,&quot; says spokesman Donald Foley, &quot;is that we have been making the contacts and we're ready to reap the financial rewards.&quot; Mr. Gephardt also has as good a chance as anyone to win the allegiance of the AFL-CIO, which is to decide this fall whether to endorse a Democratic candidate.    --Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee. At 39 the youngest -- and least-tested -- Democrat in the field, Mr. Gore is in a position to make an appeal to two important voting groups: young people and Southerners. Unless Mr. Nunn or Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton enter the race, Mr. Gore hopes he could be in a strong position for the &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; round of primaries, which are mainly in the South and will decide about 32% of the delegates for the presidential nomination.    --Mr. Jackson. The only contender with experience in a previous presidential campaign, Mr. Jackson retains a strong base. In recent months, Mr. Jackson, whose support in 1984 was almost totally among black voters, has reached out to whites, stressing economic issues that have special appeal in Iowa. The withdrawal of the front-runner makes it even more difficult for black politicians to stay away from his campaign.    --Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois. Mr. Simon, a long shot, moved into the Washington campaign headquarters vacated by Mr. Hart last week. Though he has little organizational support, Mr. Simon's liberal voting record may help him win converts from the Hart camp.    &quot;Hart and Simon were talking about the same kinds of things in similar ways,&quot; says former Rep. Bob Edgar of Pennsylvania, the deputy campaign manager.    Mr. Hart's withdrawal is likely to entice some to run as favorite-son candidates in their states. Already, such politicians as Oklahoma Sen. David Boren and Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste are considering favorite-son candidacies.    It's still not certain whether any of the nationally known non-candidates will enter the race. The most likely new entrants remain Sen. Nunn and Gov. Clinton, two Southerners with advisers who take the view that they could join the campaign late and make their stand in the southern primaries -- though very few others think that's possible.    The presence of Mr. Hart in the field wasn't a factor in Gov. Cuomo's and Sen. Bradley's decisions to stay out. Many Democratic politicians thought, despite Mr. Hart's huge lead in the polls, that the Colorado Democrat wasn't likely to win the nomination, and his withdrawal probably won't prompt Messrs. Cuomo and Bradley to reconsider.    ---   Do you think it would be better for the country to have a Democrat or Republican as the next president?     Democrat                 37%    Republican               31%    Makes no difference      20%    Not sure                 12% The Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll   ---   A Miami Herald photographer who helped stake out Gary Hart's townhouse bolstered one part of the former Colorado senator's version of events.    The Herald reported yesterday that photographer Brian Smith saw a car fitting the description of one owned by William Broadhurst double-parked outside the townhouse on the Saturday afternoon that the paper said no one entered or left.    The Herald's initial stories said its reporters didn't see any comings or goings from late Friday night, when Mr. Hart and part-time actress Donna Rice were seen entering, to Saturday at 8:40 p.m. But Mr. Hart, his friend Mr. Broadhurst and Ms. Rice have said Ms. Rice and her friend Lynn Armandt spent Friday night at Mr. Broadhurst's and then joined Mr. Hart for a Saturday afternoon drive.    The Herald yesterday said Mr. Smith saw people outside the house Saturday afternoon but concluded it was a &quot;false alarm&quot; because he didn't spot a woman with blond hair. Ms. Rice has blond hair.    The paper said that Mr. Smith saw a maroon car double-park at the house between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., and that he followed it to a nearby church, where a man and a woman he didn't recognize got out. But when he developed his film, Mr. Smith noticed for the first time that there were two maroon cars involved and realized he had followed the wrong one.    The paper said, however, that none of its five staffers involved in the surveillance saw Mr. Hart and Ms. Rice return, &quot;which they would have had to have done Saturday afternoon or evening.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
