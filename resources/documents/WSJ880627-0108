The department reversed its initial decision to refuse entry to a bicycle messenger who was wearing a shirt emblazoned with the words &quot;Meese Is a Pig.&quot; To the ACLU, the messenger's right to insult was apparently a grand constitutional issue. It threatened to file a lawsuit on behalf of &quot;Meese Is a Pig.&quot; ACLU attorney Arthur B. Spitzer said, &quot;If they had a rule that said no T-shirts, that might be an acceptable rule. But apparently they have a rule that says no T-shirts that insult Ed Meese.&quot; Thus, he reasoned, the department &quot;obviously doesn't understand what the First Amendment is all about.&quot; We almost regret that this burning issue didn't get the opportunity to elicit opinions from a series of federal judges. First Amendment issues notwithstanding, others might simply see this as another sign of the debasement of political discourse in our nation's capital. </TEXT></DOC>
