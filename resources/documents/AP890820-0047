While the president went out boating later in the day, a groupcalled the American Lebanese Community of greater Massachusettsdemonstrated in front of his seaside home on Walker's Point, callingfor the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanon.   At St. Ann's Episcopal Church, Bush and his wife, Barbara, sat inthe front pew as the Rev. Dr. Laman Bruner Jr. offered a prayer forthe freedom of American and other foreign hostages being held bykidnappers in the Middle East, naming each one.   He also prayed for those who have been killed, including Lt. Col.William Higgins, the Marine whose hanging body was shown in avideotape released last month by a pro-Iranian Moslem extremistgroup.   Meanwhile, a pro-Iranian extremist group believed to be holdingAmericans Joseph Cicippio and Edward Austin Tracy said Sunday itwould consider killing the two men if the French navy intervenes inLebanon's civil war. France said the ships were sent to be ready toevacuate 7,000 French nationals in Lebanon if necessary.   ``America, which is spurring France, should realize that anyfoolhardiness by the French fleet will expose the life of itshostages to danger,'' the statement by the group calling itself theRevolutionary Justice Organization said. ``Therefore, this factorshould be taken into consideration.''   The White House declined to comment Sunday night on the newthreats.   The president went boating immediately after church, and was outin his speedboat again in the late afternoon as a storm wasgathering. At the same time, about 200 peaceful protesters totingplacards made their way along the seafront road to his home.   The signs read: ``Lebanon needs Bush,'' ``Mr. Bush react'' and``Save democracy in Lebanon.''   Secret Service and local police kept a watchful eye on the group,whose leaders said they had a permit for a two-hour demonstrationnear Walker's Point. They said they wanted Bush to urge worldleaders to press for removal of all foreign troops from Lebanon,especially those of Syria, and to call for an economic embargoagainst Syria.   The group sees the ``silence of America as an O.K. to commit thecrime of the century in Lebanon,'' said Charles Bourouphael, theorganization's chairman.   Robert Gates, deputy national security adviser, met briefly withthe group's leaders, expressed his sympathy and said he would relaytheir concerns to Bush, said an administration source who declinedto be further identified.   A pelting rainstorm hit as the protest was about to break up.   The storm also caught the president and some of his children whotook his speedboat out on the ocean.   The president began his day with a two-mile jog despite a morningdownpour that let up just before he started off with daughterDorothy, three reporters and two White House staff members.   It was his first jog since he arrived for the seaside vacationWednesday. He plans to return to Washington on Sept. 4.   The president and Mrs. Bush have been surrounded thus far attheir Walker's Point home by their five children and 11grandchildren for sunny days filled with tennis, swimming andboating.   They were accompanied to the church service by several of theclan and Bush's mother, Dorothy Walker Bush. The 88-year-old Mrs.Bush was helped from the presidential limousine and into the churchby the president and his wife.   As they left, the president, dressed in an emerald green jacketand cadet blue slacks, called out, ``Off to fishing.''   When the motorcade arrived back at his house just a few momentsaway, Secret Service agents had his speed boat Fidelity ready to goand were waiting in protection boats that accompany the presidentialfishing excursions.   Bush headed off to sea as he has done every day of his vacation.   Outside the church he spotted a friend and engaged him in a quickexchange about fishing gear, asked if he was going out, then toldhim to ``call me.''   He stood in his limousine door and waved to a small crowd ofonlookers that gathered to see him come out.</TEXT></DOC>
