Under the contract, Lockheed Engineering, a subsidiary of Calabasas, Calif.-based Lockheed Corp., will perform engineering work for the space shuttle and space station projects at Johnson Space Center in Houston. Among the areas to be covered are propulsion, aerodynamics, avionics and flight performance.    That work currently is provided under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's contracts with Lockheed; McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co., a unit of St. Louis-based McDonnell-Douglas Corp.; and Northrop Services Inc., a unit of Los Angeles-based Northrop Corp.    The contract will be awarded on a cost-plus basis. Lockheed has estimated that the portion of the contract that applies to the cost of the work will total $655 million. The space agency also will pay an additional fee based on Lockheed's performance.    Lockheed shares rose $1.25, to $52.375, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
