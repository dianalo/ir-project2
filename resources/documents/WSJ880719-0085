Didn't we do a good job? It's probably the only platform in the history of America that just says, &quot;Good morning, America, we love ya.&quot;    --Rep. Louise Slaughter (D., N.Y.).    The Democratic Party, Americans will be relieved to know, believes in a U.S. foreign policy that is &quot;neither gun-shy nor trigger-happy.&quot; It also believes, thank heavens, &quot;that we can neither police the world nor retreat from it.&quot;    Those are merely two of the lapidary phrases contained in the remarkable document entitled &quot;The Restoration of Competence and the Revival of Hope,&quot; also known as the Democratic Party's 1988 platform. If you're wondering what either phrase really means, that seems to be the point -- to make voters wonder.    Historically, platforms have laid out the themes and issues for the fall campaign, even if the candidate fudged on specifics. But this Democratic platform is notable mainly for what it doesn't say. To borrow a metaphor much-loved by Democrats, think of it as the Teflon platform. Ideas may strike it but they just bounce off.    There's a method to this ambiguity. Tired of losing elections, Party Chairman Paul Kirk and the Democratic leaders have sought to craft a short, general document that in effect pledges liberal principles without describing liberal programs. It promises (as Jesse Jackson might say) the gain without the pain. While the 1984 platform contained about 40,000 words, this one has only 4,000; and while most of those are devoted to deploring the ravages of the past seven years, the platform doesn't once mention the words &quot;Ronald Reagan,&quot; much less dare to criticize him.    &quot;Our party should develop a winning Democratic platform . . . we should avoid a long list of legislative proposals and a litany of social, cultural or ideological buzzwords,&quot; Mr. Kirk told the platform drafting committee in June. &quot;We have not only to speak to ourselves, we have to remember those so-called 'swing voters'&quot; -- those moderate Democrats and independents who abandoned the increasingly liberal party to vote for Ronald Reagan. Presumably, Michael Dukakis also doesn't object to running on this vague statement of principles, because his aides are doing their best this week to assist Mr. Kirk.    And Mr. Kirk has come close to succeeding -- except for the nettlesome Rev. Jackson. Unlike the party leadership, Mr. Jackson doesn't mind saying out loud, so that voters might hear, what he thinks the Democrats really should stand for. As he put it Sunday, &quot;Our minority planks are majority positions.&quot; The Rev. Jackson has the courage of his party's convictions. This evening, when his campaign presents for debate one or more of his 13 minority platform planks for higher taxes and more federal spending, he'll simply be demonstrating what the party itself would have said if it still believed liberalism was a majority point of view.    The main platform, on the other hand, aims for the same goals as Mr. Jackson but just won't say how it plans to reach them. It promises better health care and housing, for example, but it tiptoes around the issue of more government programs to provide them.    It neatly relies on the conditional: &quot;We believe that homelessness . . . should be ended in America; that the supply of affordable housing should be expanded . . . that the inventory of public and subsidized housing should be renovated.&quot; Who should do all this? By implication it's the government, but the platform doesn't say so.    Even when the platform does call for government action, it avoids many specifics that might be a target for George Bush. It endorses &quot;the principle of pay equity for working women,&quot; but says nothing about that feminist favorite, &quot;comparable worth.&quot; Health insurance for everyone gets a boost, but not Sen. Ted Kennedy's national-health-care plan. Child care should be made &quot;more available and affordable,&quot; but there's no mention of the multibillion-dollar child-care entitlement pushed by Sen. Christopher Dodd and the special-interest Children's Defense Fund.    Indeed, there isn't a dollar sign in the document. &quot;It is time for America . . . to reassert progressive values and reinvest in its people,&quot; it says, but only &quot;within a strong commitment to fiscal responsibility.&quot; The Democrats do take a rhetorical bow to the Rev. Jackson's stump-speech line about &quot;economic violence against poor and working people,&quot; but they reject his proposals to raise taxes on &quot;the very richest Americans&quot; or to freeze defense spending. Apparently, progressive values are terrific until you have to tell voters what they cost.    On defense and foreign policy, the platform illustrates what might be called the neither-nor Democratic Party. Democrats are neither against this nor for that, as in &quot;neither gun-shy nor trigger-happy.&quot; They're not doves, but they're not hawks either. They &quot;believe in a stronger America ready to make the tough choices of leadership in an ever-dangerous world,&quot; but the conviction breaks down when it comes to hard cases.    The platform urges that space weapons be banned &quot;in their entirety,&quot; but it doesn't have the nerve to say it opposes SDI. It vows to maintain a &quot;stable nuclear deterrent&quot; -- a locution that avoids explaining why Gov. Dukakis supports neither the MX nor Midgetman missiles, and would defer deploying the Trident submarine D-5 missile and Stealth bomber. It says Democrats will make &quot;clear our readiness to use force when force is required&quot; -- which has the advantage of not mentioning U.S. actions in Grenada or Libya that most national Democrats initially opposed and Mr. Dukakis still opposes.    As for Nicaragua, the platform naturally endorses the Arias Peace Plan, as well as &quot;human rights, democracy, and security.&quot; But it doesn't mention funding the Contras, much less the periodic Sandinista actions to shutter La Prensa or the Catholic radio station. The Rev. Jackson, by contrast, wants Democrats to &quot;end all efforts to maintain the Contras as a military force&quot; -- which is no more than what the Democrats in Congress have already voted to do.    If all of this platform finesse is obvious as election strategy, that doesn't mean there still aren't Democrats out there with ideas. Indeed, several groups are already working to come up with specific proposals that will become more or less the fine print of this year's platform. They may be quiet now, but their proposals would undoubtedly influence a Dukakis administration.    The Democracy Project, a liberal think-tank, is compiling &quot;Blueprints for America: Transition '89,&quot; a policy document with detailed recommendations for nearly every federal agency and department. It's timed for release after the election. Its contributors will include such Carter-era luminaries as consumerists Ralph Nader and Joan Claybrook, human-rights activist Aryeh Neier, arms-controller Paul Warnke, dovish Sovietologist Stephen Cohen, and industrial-policy promoter (and Gov. Dukakis adviser) Robert Reich.    &quot;The platform is a set of ideals,&quot; says James Ledbetter, the research director for the Democracy Project. &quot;We intend to offer a blueprint.&quot;    As usual, Mr. Jackson's &quot;progressive wing&quot; of the party is already ahead in this game. Its main think-tank, the Institute for Policy Studies, released its policy opus this week. Entitled &quot;Winning America,&quot; the IPS blueprint includes such proposals as making housing a government entitlement &quot;above property rights.&quot; On the other hand, the centrist Democratic Leadership Council of Sen. Sam Nunn and Gov. Charles Robb is also spinning out proposals to flush out its vision of &quot;democratic capitalism.&quot; To have any Democrat endorse capitalism is at least a sign of progress.    The important question, of course, is whether the Democratic Party remains in its heart a liberal-left party, even if this year it prefers not to advertise this to the voters. On this point, it's instructive to contrast the 1988 platform not with Walter Mondale's in 1984 but with the platform from the race Gov. Dukakis likes to compare his own contest to, John F. Kennedy's in 1960.    The party's liberals were more confident then. The 20,000-word platform asserted, without apology, dozens of detailed proposals for government action. The hard experience of the 1970s and Ronald Reagan hadn't yet combined to show the prudent limits of the welfare state.    But the party's liberalism was also different then, too, especially on foreign policy. The 1960 platform actually spoke of supporting &quot;freedom fighters&quot; (in Hungary), of modernizing America's nuclear deterrent, and of reaffirming &quot;our historic policy of opposition to the establishment anywhere in the Americas of governments dominated by foreign powers&quot; (the Monroe Doctrine, not the Rio Treaty). It also spoke about reducing -- yes, reducing -- taxes, and resisting &quot;the temptation to accept remedies that deny American producers and consumers access to world markets.&quot;    The Democratic Party has come a long way since then -- which may be the most important reason it prefers a platform this year that just says it's good morning in America.    ---   Mr. Gigot is a member of the Journal's editorial board. </TEXT></DOC>
