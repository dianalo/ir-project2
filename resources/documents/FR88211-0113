The Plan was issuedon April 20, and was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of April 30, 1987 (52 FR 15875), as AppendixC to Subpart E, 40 CFR Part 763.To conduct asbestos-related work in schools, persons must receive accreditationin order to inspect school buildings for asbestos, develop management plans,and design or conduct response actions. Such persons can be accreditedby States, which are required to adopt contractor accreditation plans atleast as stringent as the EPA Model Plan, or by completing an EPA-approvedtraining course and passing an examination for such course. The EPA ModelContractor Accreditation Plan establishes those areas of knowledge of asbestosinspection, management plan development, and response action technologythat persons seeking accreditation must demonstrate and States must includein their accreditation programs.In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of October 30, 1987 (52 FR 210), EPA promulgateda final ``Asbestos-Containing Materials in Schools'' rule (40 CFR Part736, Subpart E) which required all local education agencies (LEAs) to identifyasbestos-containing materials (ACM) in their school buildings and takeappropriate actions to control the release of asbestos fibers. The LEAsare also required to describe their activities in management plans, whichmust be made available to the public and submitted to State Governors.Under Title II, LEAs are required to use specially trained persons to conductinspections for asbestos, develop the management plans, and design or conductmajor actions to control asbestos. The new rule took effect on December14, 1987.The length of initial training courses for accreditation under the ModelPlan varies by discipline. Briefly, inspectors must take a 3-day trainingcourse; management planners must take the inspection course plus an additional2 days devoted to management planning; and abatement project designersare required to have at least 3 days of training. In addition, asbestosabatement contractors and supervisors must take a 4-day training courseand asbestos abatement workers are required to take a 3-day training course.For all disciplines, persons seeking accreditation must also pass an examinationand participate in annual re-training courses. A complete description ofaccreditation requirements can be found in the Model Accreditation Planat 40 CFR Part 763, Subpart E, Appendix C.I.1.A. through E.In section 206(c)(3) of Title II, the Administrator, in consultation withaffected organizations, was directed to publish (and revise as necessary)a list of asbestos courses and tests in effect before the date of enactmentof this title which qualified for equivalency treatment for interim accreditationpurposes, and a list of asbestos courses and tests which the Administratordetermined were consistent with the Model Plan and which qualify a contractorfor accreditation. The <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice of October 30, 1987, included the initiallist of course approvals. In addition, the list included State accreditationprograms that EPA has approved as meeting the requirements of the ModelPlan.Three types of EPA approvals are included in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices. Unit I discusses EPA approval of Stateaccreditation programs. Unit II covers EPA approval of training courses.Unit III discusses EPA approval of training courses for interim accreditation.Lastly, Unit IV provides the list of State accreditation programs and trainingcourses approved by EPA as of January 1988. Subsequent <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices will add other State programs and trainingcourses to this second cumulative list.     <ITAG tagnum="84">I. EPA Approval of State Accreditation Programs</ITAG>As discussed in the Model Plan, EPA is able to approve State Accreditationprograms that the Agency determines are at least as stringent as the ModelPlan. In addition, the Agency is able to approve individual disciplineswithin a State's accreditation program. For example, a State that currentlyonly has an accreditation requirement for inspectors can receive EPA approvalfor that discipline immediately rather than waiting to develop accreditationrequirements for all disciplines in the Model Plan before seeking EPA approval.EPA can also approve State training programs that do not fully meet theModel Plan's requirements but do meet the requirements for interim accreditation.As listed in Unit IV, New Jersey has received EPA approval for two accreditationdisciplines that are at least as stringent as the Model Plan. Any trainingcourses in those two disciplines approved by New Jersey are EPA-approvedcourses for purposes of accreditation. These training courses are EPA-approvedcourses for purposes of TSCA Title II in New Jersey and in all States withoutan EPA-approved accreditation program for that discipline. A current listof training courses approved by New Jersey is listed under Unit IV. AsNew Jersey requires participants of these courses to take the State exam,those New Jersey-approved course sponsors who are contemplating presentingthe training in another State must develop their own examination. Theymust also submit a detailed statement about the development of the courseexamination to the Regional Asbestos Coordinator in their region for EPAapproval. EPA has also approved a number of State programs for purposes of providinginterim accreditation for persons who have met the training and exam requirementsof these State programs. The Alaska, Arkansas, Kansas, and Washington Stateprograms for asbestos abatement workers and contractors and supervisorsare approved for purposes of interim accreditation. In addition, Illinois'and Michigan's training programs for asbestos abatement workers are approvedfor purposes of interim accreditation. All of these State programs arelisted in Unit IV. As stated above, the Alaska and Washington programs clearly meet EPA'sinterim accreditation requirements. Currently, EPA is conducting a reviewto determine whether one or both State programs are at least as stringentas the Model Plan. One or both programs may receive full approval afterEPA's review is complete. All State programs nationwide that do not fullymeet the Model Plan's requirements must be upgraded within the time periodspecified in TSCA Title II to be at least as stringent as the Model Plan.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. EPA Approval of Training Courses</ITAG>A cumulative list of training courses approved by EPA are listed underUnit IV. The examinations for these approved courses under Unit IV havealso been approved by EPA. EPA has three categories of course approval:full, contingent, and approved for interim accreditation. Courses approvedfor interim accreditation will be discussed in Unit III. Full approval means EPA has reviewed and found acceptable the course'swritten submission seeking EPA approval and has conducted an on-site auditand determined that the training course meets or exceeds the Model Plan'straining requirements for the relevant discipline. Contingent approval means the Agency has reviewed the course's writtensubmission seeking EPA approval and found the materials to be acceptable(i.e., the written course materials meet the Model Plan's training courserequirements). However, EPA has not yet conducted an on-site audit. Successful completion of either a fully approved course or a contingentlyapproved course provides full accreditation for course attendees. If EPAsubsequently audits a contingently approved course and withdraws approvaldue to deficiencies discovered during the audit, future course offeringswould no longer have EPA approval. However, withdrawal of EPA approvalwould not effect the accreditation of persons who took previously offeredtraining courses, including the course audited by EPA. EPA-approved training courses listed under Unit IV are approved on a nationalbasis. EPA has organized Unit IV by EPA Region to assist the public inlocating those training courses that are offered nearby. Training coursesare listed in the Region where the training course is headquartered, althoughseveral sponsors offer their courses in various locations in the UnitedStates. EPA-approved State accreditation programs have the authority to have morestringent accreditation requirements than the Model Plan. As a result,some EPA-approved training courses listed under Unit IV may not meet therequirements of a particular State's accreditation program. Sponsors oftraining courses and persons who have received accreditation or are seekingaccreditation should contact individual States to check on accreditationrequirements. A number of training courses offered by several universities before EPAissued the Model Plan equaled or exceeded the subsequently issued ModelPlan's training course requirements. These courses are listed under UnitIV as being fully approved. It should be noted that persons who have successfullycompleted these courses are fully accredited; they are not limited onlyto being accredited on an interim basis. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. EPA Approval of Training Courses for Interim Accreditation </ITAG>TSCA Title II enables EPA to permit persons to be accredited on an interimbasis if they have attended previous EPA-approved asbestos training andhave passed (or pass) an asbestos exam. As a result, the Agency has approvedtraining courses offered previously for purposes of accrediting personson an interim basis. Only those persons who have taken training coursessince January 1, 1985, will be considered under these interim accreditationprovisions. In addition, EPA will not grant interim accreditation to anyperson who takes an equivalent training course after the date on whichthe asbestos-in-schools rule took effect (i.e., December 14, 1987). Thisaccreditation is interim since the person shall be considered accreditedfor only 1 year after the date on which the State where the person is employedestablishes an accreditation program at least as stringent as the EPA ModelPlan. If the State does not adopt an accreditation program within the timeperiod required by Title II, persons with interim accreditation must becomefully accredited within 1 year after the date the State was required tohave established a program. For purposes of the Model Plan, an equivalent training course is one thatis essentially similar in length and content to the curriculum found inthe Model Plan. In addition, an equivalent examination must be essentiallysimilar to the examination requirements found in the Model Plan.  Persons who have taken equivalent courses in their discipline for purposesof interim accreditation, and can produce evidence that they have successfullycompleted the course by passing an examination, are accredited on an interimbasis under TSCA Title II. Evidence of successful completion of a coursewould include a certificate or photo identification card that showed theperson completed the training course on a certain date and passed the examination. For persons who took one of the EPA-approved courses for interim accreditationlisted under Unit IV, but did not take the course's examination, thesepersons may become accredited on an interim basis by passing an examinationat an EPA-funded training center. These EPA-funded training centers arelisted under Unit IV. Before taking the exam, persons must provide evidenceto the EPA-funded center that they previously had taken one of the trainingcourses listed under Unit IV that is approved by EPA for interim accreditation. The New York City Department of Environmental Protection, Bureau of AirResources has a training program for asbestos abatement workers and contractors/supervisorsthat does meet the requirements for EPA approval of training courses forinterim accreditation (See Unit IV, Region II). As a result, persons whohave met the training and exam requirements of the New York City AbatementWorker (i.e., ``handler'') or Contractor/Supervisor progam are accreditedas listed under Unit IV on an interim basis.  Courses approved by EPA as of January 1988 for interim accreditation arelisted under Unit IV. Examinations offered by these courses also are approvedfor purposes of interim accreditation. EPA expects to approve additionalcourses for interim accreditation purposes, and will list these coursesin subsequent <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices. Training course vendors that believetheir courses offered since January 1, 1985, are suitable sources for interimaccreditation should contact their EPA Regional asbestos coordinator. <ITAG tagnum="85">IV. List of EPA-Approved State Accreditation Programs and TrainingCourses  </ITAG>Below is the second cumulative listing of EPA-approved State accreditationprograms and training courses. As discussed above, periodic notificationsof EPA approval of State accreditations programs and EPA approval of trainingcourses will be published in subsequent <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices. The closing date for the acceptanceof submissions to EPA for inclusion in this second notice was early January.Omission from this list does not imply disapproval by EPA, nor does theorder of the courses reflect priority or quality. The format of the notificationlists first the State accreditation programs approved by EPA, followedby EPA-approved training courses listed by Region. The name, address, phonenumber, and contact person is provided for each training provider followedby the courses and type of course approval (i.e., full, contingent, orfor interim purposes). Unless otherwise specified by an alternative date,interim approvals are issued from January 1, 1985.  All five of the EPA-funded asbestos information centers and the three EPA-fundedsatellite training centers are using or will incorporate the EPA modelinspector and management planner course recently developed with EPA funds.All of the EPA-funded training facilities have received approvals for inspectionand management planning courses offered beginning in October 1987. Currently,almost all EPA-funded centers and all satellite centers have inspectionand management planning courses that EPA has fully approved. The Universityof Kansas has received contingent approval of its inspector and managementplanner courses. The five centers are: The Georgia Institute of Technologyin Atlanta, Georgia; the University of Kansas in Overland Park, Kansas;Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts; the University of Illinoisat Chicago, and the University of California in Berkeley, California. Thethree satellite centers are: The University of Texas at Arlington; theRobert Wood Johnson Medical School in Piscataway, New Jersey; and TempleUniversity in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As of December 1987, over 1,400inspectors and management planners had received accreditation from oneof the above EPA-funded centers.  The recently developed EPA-funded model course for inspectors and managementplanners, and an earlier course developed with EPA funding for asbestosabatement contractors and surpervisors are available in draft form forinterested parties that plan to offer training courses. Interested partiesshould contact the following firm to receive copies of the training courses:ATLIS, Suite 600, 6011 Executive Blvd., Rockville, MD 20852, Phone number:(301) 468-1916.  A fee for each course will be charged to cover the reproduction costs forthe written and visual aid materials. As soon as the model inspector/managementplanner course curriculum is final, all those who paid for the draft studentmanual will automatically receive the instructor manual and the accompanyingslides.
