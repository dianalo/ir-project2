Fitzgerald, chairman and chief executive officer.    In an interview, he declined to make a specific forecast. Northern, a telecommunications-equipment manufacturer, had 1987 net of $347.2 million, or $1.39 a share, on revenue of $4.85 billion, and its gross profit margin increased to 40.3% from 37.7%. However, net fell slightly in the 1988 first quarter to $57.6 million from $60.1 million a year earlier, although per-share earnings held steady at 23 cents, because of a higher preferred-share dividend requirement in the 1987 quarter.    The decline in first-quarter profit reflected a shift in Northern's Canadian production to less profitable wire and cable products during a four-week strike in March at its main Canadian plant in Bramalea, Ontario, where telephone switches are produced.    Central-office switches, which accounted for 53% of Northern's revenue last year, are used by telephone companies to route voice and data communications over telephone lines.    Mr. Fitzgerald said he expects that sales of switches, as measured by new telephone lines, &quot;are going to flatten out&quot; during the next few years, and that increased competition in North America will continue to drive down prices. But Northern can continue to boost sales and profits from its switching division by developing enhancements, such as its new central processing unit for its family of DMS SuperNode digital switches, he said.    &quot;In spite of the fact that we continue to sell at lower and lower prices, I still see our switching revenue gaining,&quot; Mr. Fitzgerald said.    Over the longer term, he said central-office sales should account for a smaller share of revenue, as sales from transmission and integrated business systems increase. Transmission products link voice and data communication systems through optical fibers, microwave systems and satellites, and Northern has about 12% of the North American market.    One product the company is counting on to boost its switching division sales is a new central processing unit of its SuperNode switch, called SuperCore. It doubles the processing power of Northern's DMS switches and lets telephone companies design their own software programs for additional phone services.    Northern installed its first SuperCore unit last year and expects to install 300 units this year. It is promoting the DMS SuperNode switch as a replacement for stored program analog switches, which currently account for 50% of all switches in the U.S.    Most telephone companies don't plan to replace the older analog switches until the late 1990s. But Mr. Fitzgerald said Northern aims to &quot;pull forward the replacement cycle, because we can prove to the telephone companies that they can improve their operating costs and add to their operating revenue by tearing out the stored program analog and replacing it with digital.&quot;    Northern's agreement to form a joint marketing and product development group with Hewlett-Packard Co. is still in a testing stage. &quot;Let's offer the market some new capability and see where it takes us,&quot; Mr. Fitzgerald said. The joint group employs a total of about 40 staffers from the two companies. </TEXT></DOC>
