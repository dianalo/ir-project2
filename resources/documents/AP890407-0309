On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 22cents to close at $20.02 a barrel. Other contract months alsogained.   Refined products traded on the exchange also rose. Unleadedgasoline for May delivery closed .40 cent higher at 64.95 cents agallon and May heating oil settled up .38 cent at 51.60 cents.Other contract months mostly were higher.   Energy brokers attributed Friday's gains mostly to technicalfactors, but said the market got a lift from news that Exxon Corp.and British Petroleum Inc. would not curtail crude shipments to theWest Coast because of the oil spill off the Alaskan coast.   In addition, British Petroleum announced the shutdown of an oilplatform in the North Sea for repairs.   ``That takes production out of the market and impacts prices,''said Richard Kane, energy broker with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.   Crude prices also continue to gain strength from investorconfidence that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesis serious about reducing production.   The International Energy Agency in its monthly oil market reporton Friday estimated OPEC production for March at 19.6 millionbarrels a day, 200,000 barrels less than in February. The cartelhas cut its production by about 3 million barrels since lastDecember in an effort to strengthen world oil prices.</TEXT></DOC>
