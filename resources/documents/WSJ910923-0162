At the center of concerns about the bid announced by theNational Organization of Life and Health Insurance GuarantyAssociations is whether the organization -- a voluntary groupwith no direct powers over its 47 member guaranty funds --can marshal the roughly $1 billion needed over time to makeits plan work.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I'm sure the group has the best interests ofpolicyholders at heart, but there is a real question whetherthe money is there,&quot; said Robert Lusardi, a managing directorand insurance specialist at Lehman Brothers.   Separately, the guaranty funds proposal pushed aside aprivate investor group's plans to announce a bid forExecutive Life. A formal bid by a French investment group,however, remains in place.   The guaranty funds organization said Thursday that it willsubmit a bid to acquire Executive Life in a step that couldsweeten terms for policyholders and save the nation'sinsurers hundreds of millions of dollars by narrowing thefinancial &quot;gap&quot; that must be filled by industry-fundedguaranty funds.   Unlike other proposals for Executive Life, the guarantyfunds plan wouldn't require a profit to outside investors butwould simply reduce this key industry liability, estimated at$1 billion. In theory, that would return more money topolicyholders, about $400 million by one estimate.   But there are major practical and legal problems with theplan, analysts said. Never before has the guaranty fundsorganization -- an office with eight employees in Herndon,Va., that assembles statistics and coordinates guaranty fundactions in insolvencies -- proposed the acquisition of aninsurer, let alone of one the size of Executive Life.   Moreover, the national organization must now convince its47 member state insurance guaranty associations, whose lawsand exposure to the Executive Life failure vary widely, to goalong with the proposal. State guaranty funds usually assessinsurers for money to make good on failed policies as theycome due and may not have the legal power to assess membersfor money or commitments to fund a continuing insuranceoperation, even if it is declared insolvent, analysts said.   Eden Sarfaty, president of the guaranty fundsorganization, turned aside such doubts. He said theorganization has the available management resources of theentire life insurance industry. He said a core of majorstates, which he declined to name, have already endorsed thenational organization's plan, suggesting that it wouldreceive approval and financing.   The guaranty associations must file a bid by Oct. 11 in acourt-monitored auction for Executive Life, which was seizedin April by California insurance regulators. Executive Lifeis the nation's second-largest insurance failure after MutualBenefit Life Insurance Co., Newark, N.J., which was takenover by regulators in July.   The sole bid filed to date is by a French investor groupthat includes Altus Finance, a 60%-owned unit of the Frenchbank Credit Lyonnais. The French proposal would sell most ofExecutive Life's junk-bond portfolio to Altus Finance for$2.7 billion, or a little more than half its book value. Theformer Executive Life would be renamed and continue as aninsurance company without junk bonds and with $300 million inadditional cash provided by seven investors headed by aFrench insurer.   By contrast, the guaranty fund organizations plan to keepExecutive Life's junk bonds and to administer both theinvestment portfolio and the company's life insurancepolicies to maturity.   Under both the French and guaranty fund plans,policyholders within the state guaranty fund limits(generally $100,000 of annuity or face value of a policy or$300,000 in death benefits) would eventually receive 100cents on the dollar. Amounts greater than the guaranty fundlimits would get about 81 cents on the dollar under theFrench group plan and about 85 cents under the guaranty fundsproposal. However, holders of about $1.9 billion in municipalbonds backed by Executive Life would receive little ornothing under either plan.   Mr. Sarfaty said in an interview that the continuingoperations of Executive Life would be formed as a stockcompany owned by the state guaranty associations. He said newcapital would be provided to the company in the form ofsecurities, representing a commitment from the guarantyassociations. About $1 billion in securities would beprovided, sufficient to leave the new Executive Life withabout $300 million in capital surplus.   Rival bids in the California &quot;auction&quot; for Executive Lifeare likely to be judged on anticipated payments topolicyholders and the strength of the capital base theypropose for the continuing company. Securities normally wouldbe seen as less attractive than cash.   As insurance insiders scrambled late last week to analyzethe guaranty association's proposal, one group waiting in thewings told California regulators that its pending proposalfor Executive Life was &quot;off the table.&quot;   The group, which included San Francisco investment bankersHellman andamp; Friedman and Chicago investor Samuel Zell, was tohave announced a bid similar to the guaranty associationproposal on Thursday.   Like the national guaranty funds proposal, the Hellman andamp;Friedman bid would have kept Executive Life's junk bonds. Thegroup proposed to inject $500 million in cash into the failedcompany with another $500 million in standby commitments ifneeded.   People close to the bidding said the Hellman andamp; Friedmangroup unintentionally disclosed their plan to guaranty fundsofficials during a private presentation to top insuranceindustry officials, where representatives from the nationalguaranty association were in the audience. Mr. Sarfaty saidthe information hadn't influenced his organization's plans.   When the guaranty funds' bid was announced, peopleconnected with the Hellman andamp; Friedman plan angrily toldCalifornia Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi that theirbid was &quot;off the table.&quot; A spokesman for Mr. Garamendiwouldn't comment directly but said there are three potentialbidders, all of whom were expected to continue even with theguaranty associations' bid.   For its part, the Hellman andamp; Friedman group maintained thatthe guaranty association's bid knocked it out of the box. &quot;Ifthe bid is affirmed by {Mr. Garamendi} as meeting hisstandards, then there is no room for us,&quot; said John Byrne,chairman of the Fund American Cos. and a prominent insuranceexecutive who is a member of the group.   Los Angeles-based Executive Life is former principal unitof First Executive Corp., which is now is Chapter 11bankruptcy proceedings. A small First Executive unit,Executive Life Insurance Co. of New York, is in the hands ofregulators in that state and isn't directly affected bynegotiations over the California company.</TEXT></DOC>
