Actual data transmitted takesthe form of electrical impulses. These can be thought of as either``on'' or ``off' or 1 and 0. The pulses are bits.   BYTE: A unit of storage usually the size of one character ofinformation.   COMPATIBLE: A computer system that can also handle data andprograms devised for other systems. (Most common areIBM-compatible, meaning the computers run software developed forIBM machines.)   CD: Compact disc.   CDV: Compact disc video.   DAT: Digital audio tape.   DATA BASE: The collection of all data used and produced by acomputer program. (Also called data bank.)   DISK: A revolving plate on which data and programs are stored.Hard disks are rigid magnetic disks in a sealed container; a fast,auxiliary storage device that makes large numbers of programs andinformation available for instant access. Floppy disks, ordiskettes, are flexible disks that provide low-cost storage and areused widely with minicomputers and microcomputers. They come in8-inch, 5\-inch and 3{-inch diameters.   The disk drive is the part of the computer that reads or writesinformation on a magnetic disk and moves data and programs betweenthe disk and the computer's memory.   DOS: An acronym for disk operating system. It is composed of oneor more diskettes on which data can be stored and one or more diskdrives to read the information stored on the disks.   K: Abbreviation for kilobyte. It means 1,024 bytes. Similarly,64K means 64 times 1,024 bytes or 65,536 bytes, not 64,000.   LCD-TV: Liquid crystal display television.   MEMORY: The part of the computer that stores data and from whichinformation can be retrieved. A kilobyte is the measure of thememory capacity.   MICROCOMPUTER: A very small computer which has a processor, asmall number of terminals and a storage system. Primarily used as apersonal computer or for a small office system. Storage generallyis less than that of a minicomputer.   A microprocessor is the processor of a microcomputer, the chipthat contains the ``brains.'' Its processing capacity is measuredin bits.   MODEM: Literally: modulate, demodulate. A device that allowscomputers to communicate with a central data base via a phone line.   MOUSE: The small, hand-held control device that can be moved ona desktop to make the cursor move across the computer screen.   RAM@ROM: RAM is an acronym for random access memory, an area ofcomputer memory that can be manipulated by the user. ROM is anacronym for read only memory, an area of computer memory whereoperating instructions and other programs reside permanently.Programs in this area of the computer can be activated, but notaltered by the user.   SPREADSHEET: A computerized ledger sheet.   SOFTWARE: Computer programs that tell the computer to do aspecific task.   SUPER-VHS: A high-performance, high-resolution version of theVHS videocassette recorder.   VCR: Videocassette recorder. (Formats include VHS, Beta, 8mm.)   WORD PROCESSING: Writing and editing with an electronic keyboardand computer.</TEXT></DOC>
