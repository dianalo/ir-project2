McMillen, D-Md., wants to close the existing loopholes by widening thedefinition of computer crime and abuse: Any malicious and deliberate act thatis aimed at making a computer system inoperable would carry a prison term ofup to 15 years, and victims of computer crime would be able to sue for civilcompensation.andM;H.R.andP;  287 is under review by the House Judiciary Committee, and thelegislation stands a good chance of passage if it receives industry backing.andM;Viruses.andP;  When a &quot;virus&quot; hit the office computers of Rep.andP;  Wally Herger,R-Calif., last year, Herger got mad enough to introduce H.R.andP;  55.andP;  Thislegislation would make it a crime to infect private government computersystems with a virus.andM;The &quot;anti-viral bill,&quot; as congressional staffers have dubbed it, would mean afine and possibly a prison term for anyone who inserts information orcommands into a computer program with the aim of causing harm or financialloss to the program's owners or users.andP;  H.R.andP;  55 would also allow victims ofvirus attacks to file a civil suit in federal court.andM;Although the legislation has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee,a similar bill (H.R.andP;  5061) never made it out of that committee in the 100thsession of Congress, which ended Dec. 31.andM;Trade secret protection.andP;  As I said in my last couple of columns, dishonestor disgruntled insiders are often the source of trade secret leaks.andP;  Datathievery is a growing concern for many U.S.andP;  businesses.andM;Prosecuting the data thefts isn't always easy, however, because existing lawsare so full of loopholes and ambiguities.andM;Rep.andP;  Matthew J. Rinaldo, R-NJ., has introduced H.R.andP;  1478, a bill that wouldmake it a federal offense for an insider to disclose sensitive data tounauthorized third parties.andM;The legislation has been referred to the House Subcommittee on CriminalJustice, but it doesn't look as if much will happen with it in the nearfuture.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
