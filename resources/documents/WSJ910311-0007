Mr. Wissman said the Europeans erred by allowing theUnited Kingdom to join the EC, and he argued, &quot;We shouldn'tdo the same mistake again&quot; by rushing to grant fullmembership to countries such as Poland, which aren't on thesame economic plane as Germany.</LP><TEXT>   At a luncheon here sponsored by the Konrad AdenauerStiftung, Mr. Wissman spoke of &quot;a kind of two- or three-speedEuropean community of which Poland can be a part withoutbeing fully integrated in the political and monetary union.&quot;   Mr. Wissman also said that the Germans are &quot;really willingto influence other parties, mainly France, to get substantialprogress&quot; on European agricultural policies in order to getthe so-called Uruguay round of international trade talks backon track.   He said that he doesn't anticipate any further increasesin German interest rates in the coming months.   The German politician pleaded for understanding fromAmericans impatient with Germany's slow response to the U.S.request for financial aid for the war against Iraq,attributing it to the rapidity with which Germany ischanging. &quot;Give us some time,&quot; he said. &quot;We have a chance toredefine our role in the world.&quot;   &quot;We have learned something in recent weeks,&quot; Mr. Wissmansaid. &quot;We cannot limit our role to Europe. We have far biggerresponsibilities. That is the message I {will} bring home.&quot;   But Mr. Wissman also asked for U.S. aid -- both financialand technical -- in modernizing and building free markets ineastern Europe and in the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
