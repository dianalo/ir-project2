ALS is a space launch system proposed jointly by the AirForce and NASA to fill the expected need for less expensive, expendablelaunch vehicles (rockets) in the late 1990s through 2025. It is proposedthat ALS would attain a launch rate of 6 to 10 per year at one launch sitein 1998. This would increase to a maximum of up to 25 launches per yearper launch site by 2010. Two launch sites are expected to be required tofulfill the proposed future launch requirements. Two existing and potentiallaunch sites are being evaluated to determine their ability to supportALS: Cape Canaveral Air Force Station/Kennedy Space Center, Florida andVandenberg Air Force Base, California.ALS is proposed to be the primary means of placing large satellites (60,000to 190,000 pounds) into equatorial and polar orbits in the future. Theexpected launch requirements for ALS include the capacity to lift from100,000 to 150,000 pounds to equatorial orbit and approximately 80,000pounds to near polar orbit. Future modification of the launch vehicle configurationunder evaluation could provide a payload lift capacity of approximately220,000 pounds to low earth orbit.The Programmatic EIS will analyze the environmental consequences of developmentof the ALS, including those of proceeding with the proposed preliminarydemonstration and evaluation of the system. The decision as to whetheror not to proceed with ALS into a demonstration/validation phase is currentlyscheduled to occur in April 1990. The focus of the Programmatic EIS willbe to evaluate the relevant environmental issues associated with all governmentplans and actions regarding development of ALS. This phase of the ALS programis proposed to occur at three separate test sites; NASA Stennis Space FlightCenter in Mississippi, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, andEdwards Air Force Base in California. It is proposed that the use and/orupgrading of existing facilities there would be required. Analysis of thesite-specific impacts of ALS testing at these locations will be includedin the Programmatic EIS. The deployment of the ALS in a test mode wouldrequire the construction or renovation of approximately four launch pads,industrial facilities, and additional infrastructure. This EIS will evaluatecumulative effects of demonstration/validation, full-scale developmentand deployment of ALS insofar as the effects can be identified at thistime. The Programmatic EIS will be prepared in accordance with the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA), the President's Council on EnvironmentalQuality (CEQ) Regulations, and Air Force Regulation (AFR) 19-2.NASA is a cooperating agency on this Programmatic EIS. Site-specific environmentalanalysis associated with full-scale development and deployment of ALS wouldbe addressed by separate environmental documentation under NEPA and theforegoing regulations.The Air Force will hold a public scoping meeting to solicit inputs on significantenvironmental issues associated with the development of ALS concepts. Becauseof the national scope of this program, the meeting will be conducted inWashington, D.C. Time, date and exact location of this meeting will beannounced in the local media at a later date. In addition to the scopingmeeting, written inputs to the scoping process are solicited. Commentsin response to this NOI or as part of the scoping process are requestedin writing within 30 calendar days from publication of this notice in the<T4>Federal Register.</T4>Questions concerning the proposed action or the NEPA process for the action,comments on this NOI, or written inputs to the scoping meeting or scopingprocess should be mailed to: Captain Hector Malave, Department of the AirForce, HQ Space Systems Division/DEV, P.O. Box 92960, Los Angeles, CA 90009-2960.Telephone inquiries should be directed to Captain Malave at (213) 643-0935.<ITAG tagnum="6">Patsy J.
