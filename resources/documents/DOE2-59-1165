An example of such aninterface was created for use at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.Design issues and decisions preceding software development are discussed,followed by details of software operation. Lessons learned during developmentthat would be applicable to a similar effort are given. 9 refs., 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
