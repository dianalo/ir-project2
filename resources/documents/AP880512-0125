Bert Bolin, 62, director of Stockholm's InternationalMeteorological Institute, will receive the money and a goldmedallion Friday night in Los Angeles, the prize committeeannounced Thursday.   Committee spokesman Howard Stone said Bolin helped lay thegroundwork in the 1940s and 1950s for modern computerized weatherforecasting. But he was awarded the 1988 Tyler Prize for researchdone since the mid-1950s on the chemistry of Earth's atmosphere andthe effects of pollutants, especially carbon dioxide produced bythe burning of fossil fuels, Stone said.   Carbon dioxide, methane and certain other gases trap heat inEarth's atmosphere, much like glass traps heat in a greenhouse.Scientists say this ``greenhouse effect'' will warm Earth'satmosphere significantly during the next century, possibly causingsea levels to rise and triggering droughts, crop failures and otherenvironmental damage.   Research by Bolin, who also is a meteorology professor at theUniversity of Stockholm and science adviser to Sweden's primeminister, ``is of fundamental scientific importance,'' the prizecommittee said.   ``He has been instrumental in determining how man's activities... have drastically increased concentrations of carbon dioxide inthe atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution.''   In a statement released by the committee, Bolin urgedreassessment of energy policies, asking, ``How much coal, oil andgas can we continue to burn in light of the mounting evidence ofnegative atmospheric effects?''   The annual Tyler Prize, administered by the University ofSouthern California, was established in 1973 by outdoor enthusiastsAlice C. Tyler and her husband, the late John C. Tyler, founder ofFarmers Insurance Group.   Tyler Prizes worth nearly $2 million have been awarded to 23scientists. On several occasions, the committee named more than oneannual winner.</TEXT></DOC>
