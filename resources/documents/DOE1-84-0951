The considerablesuccess in operative correction of even the most complex anomalies inrecent years compels ever increasing precision in preoperative demonstrationof these anomalies. Early experience with magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) at several institutions indicated that this modality is an effectivenoninvasive technique for evaluation of CHD. Indeed, MRI seems to havesome advantage over other techniques, including angiography, for definitivediagnosis of congenital anomalies of the heart and great arteries andveins. The absence of ionizing radiation and contrast medium in MRI isan additional advantage; the former is particularly important for children,who, up to this time, have frequently been subjected to enormous radiationburdens from multiple cineangiograms during initial diagnosis and follow-up.This chapter describes the MRI appearance of cardiovascular anatomy imthe segmental fashion proposed for analysis of complex CHD. Likewise,MRI demonstration of congenital cardiovascular lesions is organized intoabnormalities situated at the four segmental cardiovascular levels: greatvessels, atria, ventricles, and visceroatrial relationship. The roleof MRI in evaluation of complex ventricular anomalies such as singleventricle and thoracic aortic abnormalities is specifically described.</TEXT></DOC>
