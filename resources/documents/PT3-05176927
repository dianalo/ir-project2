The invention improves the      properties of the doug (for example, dough transferability) and decreases      the amount of water which needs to be added to the dough to achieve an      acceptable final product. The decrease in water needed has profound      effects on the efficiency and capacity of the baking process. The      invention permits a wider choice of flour and results in a final product      with improved crispness and other properties. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  One of the most popular forms of baked goods are so-called &quot;dry cereal      products&quot;; namely, baked products which have low water concentrations and      are, therefore, crispier than soft products such as bread or cake. As used      herein, the term &quot;dry cereal products&quot; refers to baked products made from      grain, such as crispbread, biscuits, rusk, breadcrumbs, sour crispbread,      crackers, baked snacks, waffles, cookies, pretzels, ice cream cones and      dark bread. </PAR><PAR>  Dry cereal products have a longer shelf life and can be distributed over      wide geographic areas in contrast to soft products which are highly      perishable and are typically distributed on a more local basis. Dry      product processes tend to be larger and more intricate--and often more      automated--as a result. </PAR><PAR>  A bottleneck in the production process of dry cereal products, such as      crispbread, biscuits, sour crispbread, and dark bread, etc. is often the      limited production capacity of ovens used, but increasing oven size      requires high capital investment. Attempts have also been made to improve      the process efficiency by using flour with a low water-binding capacity      and by other apparatus improvements. Such expedients, however, have      generally been inadequate. </PAR><PAR>  In an industrial production process of dry cereal products, such as      crispbread and biscuits, the ingredients (flour, liquid, requisite      additives, such as salt, sugar, dough raising agents and possible spices)      are mixed into a dough. A thin dough cake is baked rapidly at a high,      accurately programmed temperature, and dried. The moisture content of the      final product is extremely important and will vary depending on the      product involved. In many instances, the crispness and preservation      properties are maximized at a moisture content of between about 7% and      about 9% by weight. On an average, the crispness of biscuits is at best at      a moisture content of less than 4% by weight. In addition to water      content, the crispness and preservation properties of biscuits and other      products are affected by other factors, such as fat content. For example,      the protein content of flour used in baking semi-sweet biscuits is of      great importance for the crispness of the final product. </PAR><PAR>  The quality of flour to be used in a dry bread product depends on the      product to be prepared. In crispbread production, whole rye flour is used      in most cases; however, the popularity of wheat crispbread is on the      increase. Most biscuits are made of wheat, while the demand and      consumption of oatmeal biscuits and especially of rye biscuits are      insignificant. </PAR><PAR>  The most important flour properties are those affecting the crumb      structure, crispness and volume. With doughs raised with yeast, the      &quot;falling&quot; number required for rye flour ranges from 120 to 200. (The      &quot;falling&quot; number is measured by procedures well known and defined in the      prior art.) The falling number of rye flour to be used in a dough raised      by whipping gas into the dough (so called &quot;ice bread&quot;) should also be      relatively high. Sour, thick crispbread can be made from rye flour having      a lower falling number, because the acidity prevents the inherent enzymes      of flour from decomposing starch too far. The falling number of flour used      in the production of biscuits should be high (more than 300) due to, e.g.,      their long production process and the rather high temperature of dough      water in the production of semi-sweet biscuits, for instance. </PAR><PAR>  Flour used in the production of crispbread usually has a relatively low      protein content, generally varying between 8 and 12% by weight. The      water-binding capacity of such flour is not as high as that of flour rich      in protein, so less energy is required for drying during baking. In      biscuit baking, protein content is of vital importance to the quality of      flour and that of the product. The protein content of the flour should      range from 7.5% to 10.5% by weight on dry substance. Flour having a      protein content less than 10% by weight is best suited for baking      semi-sweet biscuits. </PAR><PAR>  Yeast or a chemical raising agent can be used for proofing. Proofing can      also be effected by mixing gaseous substances into the dough. </PAR><PAR>  In the production of both crispbread and biscuits, water or milk is used as      dough liquid. In the production of crispbread, the amount of liquid needed      is nearly equal to that of flour, that is, the dough is considerably      softer than in the production of normal soft bread. In biscuit production,      less liquid is usually needed than in the production of crispbread. The      use of large amounts of liquid requires long baking times and large      amounts of energy at the baking stage to reduce the water concentration of      the final product to an acceptable level. </PAR><PAR>  In a dry cereal product production process, the amount of dough liquid is      in most cases determined by the technical qualities of the process and the      apparatus. For example, the softness of a dough suitable for use in a      crispbread production process and, as a consequence, the amount of liquid      needed is determined on one hand by the mechanical strength of the blades      of the dough mixer and on the other hand the operation of the pricking      device. In addition, the webforming ability sets certain requirements on      the softness of dough. Dough softness is described by a consistency value.      (Consistency is measured by a penetrometer by allowing the measuring cone      of the penetrometer to fall into the dough for 10 seconds, whereby the      penetration of the cone in millimeters gives the consistency of the dough;      the greater the value, the softer the dough. A penetrometer is a standard      piece of equipment well known in the baking art.) </PAR><PAR>  The crispness, taste, and machinability of crispbreads and biscuits can be      increased by the use of fat and sugar. </PAR><PAR>  In crispbread production, the dough is formed into a weblike mat after      suitable proofing. The mat can be baked as such, or it can be cut or      chopped into separate cakes, or the mat is formed into separate cakes by      means of moulds, rolls, and the like. The cakes can be patterned before      baking, e.g., by pricking. Pricking provides the product with a pattern      typical of it, and binds the surface layers of the cake together. If      necessary, the final proofing of the products is carried out after the      patterning, whereafter the products are baked. So called &quot;ice bread&quot; is      not proofed at this stage; it is baked immediately after the pricking. </PAR><PAR>  Biscuits, such as semi-sweet biscuits, are often made by so-called &quot;all-in&quot;      (or &quot;straight&quot;) dough making process, in which the dough is prepared by      mixing all the dry ingredients simultaneously with the dough liquid and      other liquid ingredients. The way in which the dough is prepared is of      great importance in the production of semi-sweet biscuits. As semi-sweet      biscuits should possess an extensible gluten network, relatively high      dough temperatures, about andplus;40.degree. C., are desirable in the dough      preparation phase. An example of a mixer suitable for the production of      biscuits is a horizontal two-blade mixer standard in the baking industry.      After preparation, the dough should be allowed to stand so that the dough      liquid is absorbed in the dry ingredients (floor time). After the floor      time the dough is moulded, e.g., by means of a four-roll feeder and then      folded by passing it through a pair of rolls. After folding the dough is      passed through sheeting rolls. Sheeted dough is pricked and cut with a      roll cutter (drum cutter). </PAR><PAR>  The products lose moisture concentration during baking. The moisture      content of a conventional finished crispbread product is about 7% to about      12% by weight. The moisture content of product raised with gas may be as      low as about 2% by weight. On an average, the moisture content of biscuits      does not exceed about 4% by weight. </PAR><PAR>  To achieve the desired final moisture consent, the baked product usually      has to be dried further. The drying can be effected by using a convection      oven, basket conveyors transported above the oven in the waste heat,      &quot;after-baking&quot;, that is, drying in a tunnel oven, or dielectric drying. If      necessary, the baked product can be chopped, e.g., by sawing. </PAR><PAR>  It is known that cellulolytic/hemicellulolytic enzymes cleave non-starch      polysaccharides present in flour. Addition of cellulolytic and/or      hemicellulolytic enzymes has been used to improve the properties of the      baking process and the finished baking product. </PAR><PAR>  Japanese Patent Application No. 5701/1968 describes a method of improving      the quality of white sour bread by adding to the dough an enzyme      composition having cellulolytic and/or hemicellulolytic activity. It is      emphasized in the patent application that the addition of the enzyme      composition causes decomposition of fibrous components present in flour,      such as cellulose and pentosans, the presence of which as such would      considerably deteriorate the quality of bread by rendering the dough      inhomogeneous and by preventing the formation of gluten. It is recited      that the addition of cellulolytic/hemicellulolytic enzymes provides soft      bread with increased volume, more uniform grain structure and slower      ageing than bread prepared with prior art methods. </PAR><PAR>  Finnish Patent Application No. 881905 (U.S. application Ser. No. 341,389      filed Apr. 21, 1989, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,990,343 describes the use of      cellulolytic/hemicellulolytic enzymes in combination with glucose oxidase      or glucose oxidase and sulphydryl oxidase in baking soft bread from wheat      and rye flour. These enzymes are used for optimizing the baking process.      Moreover, it has been found that the enzyme combinations improve the      rheological properties, gluten, processability, and tolerance of a flour      dough. It has also been found to improve the volume, grain structure and      anti-staling properties of a bakery product. </PAR><PAR>  However, because of the significant differences in the process for baking      dry cereal products (such as crispbread, etc.) and the increased moisture      content of dough used to bake these products, enzyme treatment of dough      for dry cereal products has heretofore not been utilized. It has now been      found according to the present invention that an addition of cellulolytic      and/or hemicellulolytic enzymes increases the process capacity in the      production of dry cereal products. Unexpectedly and surprisingly, the      enzyme addition of the invention makes the dough softer, so less dough      liquid is required as compared with conventional techniques. The reduced      concentration of water requires less energy than prior art methods for      baking the product and the need for after-drying is decreased or      eliminated. In large scale baking processes, this improved efficiency will      result in substantial cost savings. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, the final product obtained by the method of the invention has      a lower shrinkage and increased crispness. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  One of the objects of the invention is to improve the baking process of dry      cereal products by decreasing the necessary moisture concentration. The      present invention contemplates a method for improving the production      process of dry cereal products and the quality of the baked product      produced therefrom which comprises combining flour, yeast and water with      an amount of an enzyme preparation comprising hemicellulose and/or      cellulose degrading enzymes effective to reduce the amount of moisture      necessary to form a suitable baking dough. The resulting dough requires      shorter baking time and the need for post-baking drying in order to reduce      the moisture content of the final product to an acceptable level is      decreased or eliminated. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, the enzyme preparation contains between about 0 to about 50,000      Units of hemicellulose degrading enzymes and about 0 to about 20,000 Units      of cellulose degrading enzymes per kilogram of flour. An enzyme      preparation which contains about 10 to about 20,000 Units of hemicellulose      degrading enzymes and about 10 to about 10,000 Units of cellulose      degrading enzymes per kilogram of flour is particularly preferred. </PAR><PAR>  The method of the present invention can be used to produce dry cereal      products such as crispbread, made of rye or wheat flour, as well as other      dry cereal products such as biscuits, pretzels, ice cream cones, dark      bread and the like. </PAR><PAR>  When the final product is a rye crispbread, the method of the present      invention wherein the enzyme preparation comprises about 1,000 to about      3,000 Units of hemicellulose degrading enzymes and/or about 400 to about      1,200 Units of cellulose degrading enzymes per kilogram of flour is      preferred. When the final baked product is a wheat crispbread, an enzyme      preparation which contains about 500 Units to about 2,000 Units of      hemicellulose degrading enzymes and/or about 200 Units to about 800 Units      of cellulose degrading enzymes per kilogram of flour is preferred. When      the final baked product is a semi-sweet biscuit, an enzyme preparation      which contains about 2,500 Units to about 10,000 Units of a hemicellulose      degrading enzyme per kilogram of flour is preferred. </PAR><PAR>  The instant invention contemplates a method which reduces the necessary      moisture concentration of the baking dough up to approximately 15% by      weight. </PAR></BSUM><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAC>  A. General </PAC><PAR>  The method of the invention is characterized by adding an enzyme      preparation containing hemicellulose and/or cellulose degrading enzymes to      the dough. </PAR><PAR>  The method of the invention provides a baking process with a greater      capacity than prior art methods. The baking process of the invention has a      lower energy consumption than prior art methods. The proof time is shorter      and the baking shrinkage is lesser when the method of the invention is      applied. The choice of flour is easier. The obtained product has      advantageous properties over products prepared with prior art methods,      such as increased crispness. </PAR><PAR>  The enzyme preparation of the invention contains enzymes degrading      hemicellulose (xylan, mannan, galactomannan, araban) and its cleavage      products or esther-bonds contained therein and/or enzymes degrading      cellulose. </PAR><PAR>  For example, an enzyme preparation (BAKEZYME 1201, manufacturer Finnsugar      Ltd.) having the following hemicellulolytic and cellulolytic activity is      suitable for use in the present invention: </PAR><TBL>  ______________________________________                                         Xylanase               25,000 Units/g                                          Carboxymethyl cellulase (CMC)                                                                          9,300 Units/g                                          Filter paper activity (FP)                                                                              380 Units/g                                           ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAR>  Xylanase activity represents hemicellulolytic activity while carboxymethyl      cellulase activity and filter paper activity represent cellulolytic      activity. </PAR><PAR>  A suitable enzyme dosage level is, e.g., about 0 to about 50,000 Units,      preferably about 10 to about 20,000 Units of hemicellulase (xylanase) and      about 0 to about 20,000 Units, preferably about 10 to about 10,000 Units      of cellulase (calculated as carboxymethyl cellulase activity), or      correspondingly about 0 to about 1,000 Units, preferably about 0.5 to      about 500 Units of cellulase (calculated as filter paper activity) per kg      flour. </PAR><PAR>  The definitions of the different enzyme activities and the methods of      determining the enzyme activities are set forth below: </PAR><PAR>  Xylanase activity (Khan A.

C. 1 ml of xylan substrate (1% xylan,      0.05M NaAc, pH 5.3) is added. The sample is incubated for 30 min at      50.degree. C. The reaction is stopped by adding 3 ml of DNS reagent      (3,5-dinitrosalicylate), and the color is developed by boiling the same      mixture for 5 min. The absorbance is measured at 540 nm.

The ratios and quality of the dough ingredients      were the same as those used in Example 2. Enzyme preparation (BAKEZYME      1210) in the amount of 90 mg/kg flour was added: (enzyme activity: 2,250      Units of hemicellulase (xylanase) and 840 Units of cellulase (CMC) per kg      flour); the amounts of dough water were reduced to about 85% of the      &quot;normal&quot; percentage, as in Example 2. Since the mass flow contained more      dry substance than usual, the weight of an unbaked cake was dropped 6.25%      from the normal value. </PAR><PAR>  The width of the unbaked cake could also be reduced by about 1.0% since the      dough prepared with the enzyme addition had a better rise than a product      prepared without enzyme addition. </PAR><PAR>  The oven time utilized was conventional, whereby a 7.7% increase in      capacity was obtained with the enzyme addition (decrease in energy      demand). </PAR><PAR>  With the addition of the enzyme preparation, the dough rose more rapidly      than normal and the properties of the finished product were good. The      crispness of the product was observed to be slightly greater than that of      a control product prepared without enzyme addition. </PAR><PAR>  A similar test was carried out by keeping the amount of energy at a      conventional value and shortening the oven time by 7.7%, corresponding to      the decrease in energy demand. The properties of this product were good      and similar to the properties noted above, suggesting that less energy is      required (when the present invention is utilized) to bake the final      product than normally required. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 4 </PAC><PAC>  Wheat Crispbread Baking Trials </PAC><PAR>  Wheat crispbread was baked using the invention on a pilotscale test basis. </PAR><PAR>  Flour with the following properties was used in the wheat crispbread baking      tests: </PAR><TBL>  ______________________________________                                         Moisture content (%)      13.4                                                 Ash content (% d.s.)       0.6                                                 Amount of moist gluten (%)                                                                               26.0                                                 Water binding ability (farinograph                                                                       58.1%                                                method).sup.1                                                                  Maximum temperature (amylograph                                                                          74.degree.

The softness      and stickiness of corresponding doughs containing more water, for the      reasons of the measuring technique used, were also measured with a      farinograph (Brabender) by introducing 300 g of dough into the trough of      the farinograph and by kneading it at constant temperature andplus;30.degree. C.      at farinograph speed 2 for 10 minutes. The softness value was obtained      after 5 minute kneading as farinogram height (Brabender unit, BU),      stickiness was measured from the corresponding graph point as farinogram      width (BU). </PAR><PAR>  After 10 minutes of floor time the doughs were first rolled manually into      3.times.3 mm thick sheets and then on a grease-proof paper into a 1 mm      thick sheet which was cut manually with a round mould (diameter 61 mm).      The whole cut dough sheet was transferred to a baking sheet covered with a      1 mm hole network. On the baking sheet the dough sheet was pricked      manually by means of a pricking wheel and the dough remaining outside the      cut portions was removed. </PAR><PAR>  The biscuits were baked in a convection oven for 7 minutes at      180.degree.-200.degree.
