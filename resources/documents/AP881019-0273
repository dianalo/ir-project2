Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Young said the investigatorshave been asked to report to him ``as quickly as possible''concerning possible insider trading and concert-party shareownership of the company's stock. This occurs when one companysecretly agrees to buy stock for another firm.   The investigation, announced shortly after the close of theLondon stock market, is being conducted at the request of thecompany, Young said.   Consolidated Gold Fields has alleged that insider dealing andshare building by parties related to Minorco occurred in the weeksahead of the Sept. 21 launch of the bid, which it is fighting.   It said the activity was ``fully consistent with insider dealershaving knowledge of both the time and value of the bid.''   The company claims that the activity affected its chances offending off the takeover attempt.   The investigation comes less than a week ahead of the Oct. 25close of the Minorco bid. Minorco is offering 19 pounds ($33) cashand one new Minorco share for every two Gold Fields shares.   A spokesman for the Department of Trade and Industry said theMinorco bid would not necessarily be stopped if the investigationturns up evidence of insider trading or concert-party purchases.Minorco has also called for an investigation of share dealingsahead of the bid.   The Department of Trade's Office of Fair Trading is alsoexpected to make a recommendation shortly on whether the bid shouldbe investigated for its impact on competition.   Consolidated Gold Fields' shares closed Wednesday at 12.20pounds ($21.35), off 35 pence (61 cents) from Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
