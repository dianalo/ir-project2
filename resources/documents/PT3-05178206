The thermal charge is reduced by 50% if the zone      sensor reads a temperature greater than 4.degree. F. above the set point.      The charge is 100% of the maximum charge if the temperature falls below      40.degree. F. The charge is 100% of the maximum charge if the temperature      falls 4.degree. F. or more below the set point temperature. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The invention relates to a heating system, and more specifically, to a      method for storing a thermal charge for use in such a system. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Related Art </PAR><PAR>  Storage heaters are available commercially which allow for an energy charge      and then for later radiation of heat. In order to maximize the potential      for energy savings using these storage heaters, a system is necessary      which can anticipate the amount of heat which will be needed during      on-peak utility hours and control charging of the heaters during off-peak      utility hours when the energy is less expensive. </PAR><PAR>  Conventional heating control systems, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos.      4,332,013 to Chelcum et al. and 4,217,646 to Caltagirone et al., control      temperature in response to sensor inputs, but do not anticipate energy      needs and charge heater storage units during off-peak hours in      anticipation of those needs. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention overcomes the problems and disadvantages of the prior      art by providing a system and method for controlling heater/storage units.      An object of the invention is allow charging during off-peak utility hours      and heating during on-peak utility hours. </PAR><PAR>  Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in      part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from      the description or may be learned by practice of the invention. The      objects and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by      means of the elements, steps and combinations particularly pointed out in      the appended claims. </PAR><PAR>  To achieve the objects and in accordance with the purpose of the invention,      as embodied and broadly described herein, the invention comprises a method      for thermal storage comprising the steps of estimating tomorrow's on-peak      heating requirements, and charging a thermal storage system during      off-peak utility hours in response to the estimated on-peak heating      requirements. </PAR><PAR>  As preferably embodied herein, the step of estimating comprises the steps      of estimating the difference between the on-peak outside temperature for      tomorrow and the on-peak indoor temperature for tomorrow, and      extrapolating tomorrow's on-peak heating requirements by multiplying      yesterday's actual on-peak thermal output by a ratio of tomorrow's      estimated on-peak difference to today's actual on-peak difference. </PAR><PAR>  It is to be understood that both the forgoing general description and the      following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are      not restrictive of the invention as claimed. </PAR><PAR>  The accompanying drawings which are incorporated in and constitute part of      the specification, illustrate one embodiment of the invention and together      with the description serve to explain the principles of the invention. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a diagram of a system employing the invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a representation of an LED Status Display as used in a system      according to the invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of logical control steps according to the      invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  Reference will now be made in detail to the presently preferred embodiment      of the invention, an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying      drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used      throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. </PAR><PAR>  A storage heater control system employing the invention is shown in FIG. 1.      The logical control of the method is microprocessor based Power supply 34      is used to provide regulated power to all elements of the system. </PAR><PAR>  Contactors 12 control the zone heater/storage units and the domestic hot      water (DHW), and are driven by contactor driver circuits 14. Contactors 12      are opened and closed in response to inputs from the utility meter 16, an      outdoor sensor 18, and one or more zone sensors 20, as explained in more      detail below. A zone as defined in this specification may be a room, a      part of a room or a group of rooms. </PAR><PAR>  The microprocessor operates according to commands stored in permanent      program memory 22, and a read/write memory provides storage for program      variables and for a history of system operation over the past few days.      The read/write memory is preferably made nonvolatile by backup battery      circuit having a replaceable lithium battery, which lasts approximately 1      year. </PAR><PAR>  Clock circuit 28 provides microprocessor 10 with basic timing signals. The      microprocessor can derive real time (i.e., hours and minutes) from the      clock circuit signals. </PAR><PAR>  Select circuit 30 is used by microprocessor 10 to select one sensor circuit      at a time. </PAR><PAR>  The state of utility switch 16 is determined by microprocessor 10 through      utility switch detection circuit 32. That circuit indicates whether      on-peak or off-peak rates are in effect. </PAR><PAR>  Finally, LED (Light Emitting Diode) Status Display 36 preferably has four      LEDs to indicate the clock operation, peak/off-peak time,      measurement-in-progress, and emergency heat. </PAR><PAR>  LED Status Display 36 is shown in FIG. 2. LEDs (38, 40, 42 and 44) indicate      the system status. Preferably, in operation, LED 38 indicates that the      system is functioning, LED 40 indicates the system is in an off-peak      period, LED 42 indicates zone sensors are being monitored, and LED 44      indicates that the system is providing emergency heat. </PAR><PAR>  Conventional and commercially available storage heaters may be used which      combine both heat energy storage and radiation functions. As an example,      commercial units are available from Unidare Engineering Limited. </PAR><PAR>  The program logic of this invention is designed to control, during off-peak      hours, the charge period allowed for storing heat energy. It is based on      inputs from outdoor sensor 18 and at least one indoor sensor 20. Detailed      steps of the control logic are incorporated into EPROM program memory 22      which is programmed to accommodate different utility schedules. </PAR><PAR>  As embodied herein and with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, the system      incorporates a self-test program which utilizes LED Status Display 36 to      insure all components of the system are functional and properly installed.      When the self-test begins, the system is powered up with a 120 volts      alternating current and top right LED 38 begins to flash indicating that      there is proper power to the circuit board. As the test proceeds, top      right LED 38 will go out and bottom two LEDs 42 and 44 will begin      alternatively flashing 10 times. During this period, all data is erased      from the microprocessor. Once all the data is erased, bottom LEDs 42 and      44 will go out and top right LED 38 will again begin to flash. In order to      test the circuitry from the meter input to the contactors, the signal from      the meter can be simulated by using a jumper across the contacts of the      meter closure terminal on the system master panel. Upon closing (or      opening depending on the specific utility system) the terminal contacts,      the drive contactors will begin to cycle on for about 2 seconds at about 1      second intervals. Assuming all the contactors on the master panel cycle      properly, circuitry from the meter closure, through the microprocessor,      and to the drive contactors is working properly. </PAR><PAR>  The next step is to test the inputs to the system. First, outdoor sensor 18      is tested by plugging in the sensor to its input terminal. Once plugged      in, top right LED 38 will go out. During this process, the system checks      that it is reading a temperature. If a valid temperature reading is taken,      top left LED 40 will verify the outside temperature sensing circuit is      functional. The outdoor sensor 18 is then unplugged from the master panel.      Top left LED 40 should go out and top right LED 38 will again begin to      flash. Next, each zone sensor 20 circuit is tested. The zone 1 sensor is      plugged into any zone input terminal on the master panel, and again top      right LED will go out and the system will check that it is reading a valid      temperature. If so, top left LED 40 will go on. Also, neither bottom left      LED 42 or bottom right LED 44 will go on. By turning the temperature      adjust knob on the sensor all the way to the right the system checks its      ability to read temperature above the midpoint of the range (approximately      67.degree. F.) and will turn on bottom right LED 44. When the knob is      turned to the left of the midpoint, the system checks its ability to read      temperatures below the midpoint of the range and will turn on bottom left      LED 42. The system also allows the installer to calibrate the midpoint of      the temperature adjust knob because both bottom LEDs will be on at the      midpoint of the range. At this point, the temperature indicator knob      should be set at 67.degree.. Once the zone 1 test is complete the sensor      is unplugged from the master panel. All the LEDs will go out and top right      LED 38 should begin to flash. This procedure is repeated for every zone to      insure that the circuitry of each zone is functional. </PAR><PAR>  After every zone has been tested, the system is brought out of the self      test mode to begin operation. During this process the system clears any      data that it has accumulated from the self test. The system is initialized      to start the first day operations by taking initial temperature readings      of each zone and the outdoor temperature. During this time, bottom left      LED 42 will be on, thereby signaling that temperature readings are being      taken. Once the system has completed its temperature readings, bottom left      LED 42 will go out and top left LED 40 will continue to flash, indicating      that the system is initialized for first day operation. </PAR><PAR>  Upon initial start-up, the system is programmed to charge the maximum      number of off-peak hours allowed by the utility. This is done to assure      heat in the space, as no history has been established, and to completely      burn off any impurities and dust left in the heaters as quickly as      possible. As a safety, the actual initial charge must be taken for at      least half the allowable hours. If not, the next charge period will again      be set for the maximum number of hours. </PAR><PAR>  The method of normal operation is discussed below with reference to FIG. 3. </PAR><PAR>  In operation, in step 102, during the on-peak (daytime) period the system      reads information once every hour from all the sensors connected to it,      and writes this information to eight individual arrays in read/write      memory 24. Upon the signal from the meter in step 100 that the off-peak      period is beginning, the system calculates the average on-peak temperature      for each zone including outdoors in step 104. This average on-peak      temperature is stored for that day in read/write memory 24. </PAR><PAR>  During the off-peak (nighttime) period in step 106, the system reads      information once every hour from all the sensors connected to it, and      writes this information to eight individual arrays. This hourly off-peak      temperature reading from the outdoor sensor is retained in the read/write      memory until the next day's reading replaces it. The indoor zone readings      are not retained. </PAR><PAR>  Upon the signal of &quot;off-peak&quot; from the meter in step 100, the system      calculates the charge time for each off-peak hour by first estimating      tomorrow's average on-peak outdoor temperature in step 108 by taking      today's average on-peak outdoor temperature plus the current outdoor      temperature minus the outdoor temperature at the same hour yesterday. The      assumption is that tomorrow's temperature will follow today's trend. </PAR><PAR>  In step 110, the system estimates the on-peak temperature difference      between the outdoor temperature and the indoor temperature for each zone      for tomorrow. This temperature difference is calculated by subtracting      tomorrow's estimated average on-peak outdoor temperature from the average      set point (thermostat setting) temperature in the zone for the day that      just ended. </PAR><PAR>  The total charge required by each zone is calculated in step 112 by      multiplying yesterday's actual charge by the estimated on-peak temperature      difference for tomorrow divided by the actual on-peak temperature      difference for yesterday. This total required charge is carried in minutes      and cannot exceed the maximum time allowed by the utility for off-peak      charging. </PAR><PAR>  In step 114, the total charge required for each zone is then divided into      each hour of available off-peak time in the ratio of total charge required      divided by maximum time allowed multiplied by 60 minutes. Each hourly      required charge is then written into an array in read/write memory 24 for      each hour of the off-peak time and maintained in memory until replaced by      the next hour's (for upcoming hours) or next day's (for past hours)      calculations. </PAR><PAR>  The process of step 114 is repeated every hour of the off-peak time and the      required charge is recalculated for the remaining hours. Additionally, the      actual charge delivered for the hour is written into an array in step 122      and retained in memory until replaced by the next day's information.      Lastly, in step 124, the total charge remaining is calculated by      subtracting the actual charge delivered from the total charge required. </PAR><PAR>  Actual charge delivered may vary from the calculated charge required due to      the special features of the system. In step 116, the hourly charge time is      adjusted if a zone sensor 20 reads a temperature greater than 4.degree. F.      above the set point. In this case the upcoming hourly charge for that zone      will be cut by 50% in step 118. If a zone sensor 20 reads a temperature      greater than 4.degree. F. below the set point in step 120, the upcoming      charge will be 100% for that zone for that hour in step 122. Finally, if      in step 120 a zone sensor 20 reads a temperature of 40.degree. F. or      lower, the upcoming hourly charge will be 100% in step 122. This is a      freeze protection feature that will come into play even during on-peak      hours and the heaters will continue to charge 100% until the temperature      rises above 40.degree. F. </PAR><PAR>  The system of this invention is equipped for power failures with battery      backup circuit 26 which serves to hold system information. During a power      interruption in off-peak or charge time, the battery maintains the amount      of required charge remaining to be applied. Once the power is restored to      the system, it continues its hourly cycle of recalculating the remaining      charge and applying it over the remaining hours. Once the utility meter      signal the end of the off-peak period, any remaining charge will be      applied at 100% until it is all charged. </PAR><PAR>  It will be apparent to those skilled in the art the various modifications      in variations can be made to the thermal storage logic of the present      invention and in construction of this thermal storage system without      departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. </PAR><PAR>  Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the      art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention      disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be      considered as exemplary only with a true scope and spirit of the invention      being indicated by the following claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
