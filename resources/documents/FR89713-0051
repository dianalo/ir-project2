This rate is adjusted annually to reflect changesin the Producer Price Index for Fresh Processed Milk, published by theBureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.For the period July 1, 1989 to June 30, 1990, the rate of reimbursementfor a half-pint of milk served to a nonneedy child in a school or institutionwhich participates in the Special Milk Program is 10.25 cents. This reflectsan increase of 5.7 percent in the Producer Price Index for Fresh ProcessedMilk from May 1988 to May 1989.As a reminder, schools or institutions with pricing programs which electto serve milk free to eligible children continue to receive the averagecost of a half-pint of milk (the total cost of all milk purchased duringthe claim period divided by the total number of purchased half-pints) foreach half-pint served to an eligible child.<T3>National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs_</T3>Pursuant tosection 11 of the National School Lunch Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1759a)and section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, as amended (42 U.S.C.1773), the Department annually announces the adjustments to the NationalAverage Payment Factors, and to the maximum Federal reimbursement ratesfor meals served to children participating in the National School LunchProgram. Adjustments are prescribed each July 1, based on changes in thefood away from home series of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers,published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.<T3>Lunch Payment Factors_</T3>Section 4 of the National School Lunch Act(42 U.S.C. 1753) provides general cash for food assistance payments toStates to assist schools in purchasing food. There are two section 4 NationalAverage Payment Factors (NAPFs) for lunches served under the National SchoolLunch Program. The lower payment factor applies to lunches served in schoolfood authorities in which less than 60 percent of the lunches served inthe school lunch program during the second preceding school year were servedfree or at a reduced price. The higher payment factor applies to lunchesserved in school food authorities in which 60 percent or more of the lunchesserved during the second preceding school year were served free or at areduced-price.To supplement these section 4 payments, section 11 of the National SchoolLunch Act provides special cash assistance payments to aid schools in providingfree and reduced-price lunches. The section 11 NAPF for each reduced-pricelunch served is set at 40 cents less than the factor for each free lunch.As authorized under section 8 and 11 of the National School Lunch Act,maximum reimbursement rates for each type of lunch are prescribed by theDepartment in this Notice. These maximum rates ensure equitable disbursementof Federal funds to school food authorities.<T3>Breakfast Payment Factors_</T3>Section 4 of the Child Nutrition Actof 1966, as amended, establishes National Average Payment Factors for free,reduced-price and paid breakfasts served under the School Breakfast Programand additional payments for schools determined to be in ``severe need''because they serve a high percentage of needy children.

L. 100-435 amended section 4(b) to increase by an additionalthree cents, to a total of six cents per meal, the supplementary fundingfor each program breakfast, effective July 1, 1989. Thus, this year andin future years, after computation of the annual rate adjustment, a totalof 6 cents will be added to the rounded per meal rates of reimbursement.The increases in breakfast reimbursement are intended to assist statesin improving the nutritional quality of breakfast served.<ITAG tagnum="84">Revised Payments</ITAG>The following specific section 4 and section 11 National Average PaymentFactors and maximum reimbursement rates are in effect through June 30,1990.
