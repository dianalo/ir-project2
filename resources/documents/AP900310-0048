Michel Aoun'sdeclared readiness to negotiate peace. Police today said fourpeople were wounded.   The command of Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia blamed theviolations of the week-old cease-fire on Aoun's troops and demanded``strict measures to prevent such attempts that jeopardizesecurity.''   Aoun's command said the militia fired four mortar rounds intoterritories held by the general's 19,000 troops in east Beirut.   A police spokesman, who requested anonymity in line withregulations, said the four casualties were wounded inmilitia-controlled districts.   By police count, 750 people have been killed and 2,093 woundedsince Jan. 30, when the inconclusive showdown began for mastery ofthe 310-square-mile enclave.   The overnight exchanges, the fiercest since a mediationcommittee called a cease-fire March 3, came after Aoun, in anunexpected conciliatory move, called for dialogue with Geagea aswell as with the various other Moslem and leftist leaders to endthe nation's 15-year-old civil war.   Aoun on Friday also dropped his outright rejection of an Arableague-brokered peace plan worked out by Lebanese legislators inthe Saudi Arabian resort of Taif last fall.   However, the 54-year-old general proposed that the plan beamended, calling for a ``Taif accord No. 2.''   Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, rejected Aoun'sproposal to amend the peace accord, declaring: ``we adhere to theTaif agreement both in letter and spirit.''   Voice of the People Radio, which is close to Hoss' government,said Aoun was ``maneuvering and stalling for time.''   The Taif accord called for a redistribution of political powerin Lebanon, doing away with Christian domination and dividing powerequally between Moslems and Christians.   Aoun earlier had rejected the pact because it did not providefor the immediate withdrawal of Syria's 40,000 troops, in Lebanonunder a 1976 peacekeeping mandate.   Aoun also has ignored orders by President Elias Hrawi to stepdown as army commander and turn over the Presidential Palace.   The intra-Christian showdown has forced one-fourth of theenclave's 1 million population to evacuate and seek refuge in saferareas.   The police spokesman said the estimated 250,000 evacuees who hadfled the Christian enclave due to the clashes ``do not seem totrust the cease-fire.''   ``Some of the evacuees return to the enclave early in the day tocheck on their damaged property, but leave before dark,'' thespokesman said.   A mediation committee is meeting separately with Aoun and Geageain an effort to consolidate the cease-fire and form a ``nationalauthority'' grouping representatives of the warring factions andindependent figures to work out a political settlement to theintra-Christian conflict.</TEXT></DOC>
