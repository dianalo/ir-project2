The agreement appears to scuttle a previously announcedagreement in principle for FNN to sell the assets, includingthe 24-hour all-business cable channel, to a partnership ofWestinghouse Electric Co.'s Group W Satellite Communicationsand Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal.Though terms of that agreement weren't disclosed, thepurchase price was said to be $90 million, with each partnerpaying half.</LP><TEXT>   NBC, through its NBC Cable division, operates FNN'sprimary competitor, CNBC, the Consumer News and BusinessChannel. Tom Rogers, president of NBC Cable, said it wouldcombine the resources of both business-oriented channels intoone entity shortly after the acquisition, which is expectedto be completed within the next couple of months.   NBC's offer, presented to FNN on Friday, was accepted lateMonday evening, following a four-and-a-half hour FNN boardmeeting in New York. Yesterday, Dow Jones and Group W saidthey were &quot;extremely disturbed&quot; that FNN had broken off its&quot;good faith efforts&quot; to complete the deal. &quot;We reiterate thatit is our intention to consummate the closing of our purchaseas promptly as possible,&quot; the partners said in a two-pageletter sent to the FNN board.   Peter G. Skinner, senior vice president of Dow Jones,declined to comment on the possibility of legal actionagainst FNN and its 47%-owner, Infotechnology Inc. Mr.Skinner said the Dow Jones-Group W partnership was &quot;on theverge&quot; of closing the deal with FNN, which was placed on theauction block last November, when FNN suddenly broke offcontact with the partnership on Monday.   But Alan J. Hirschfield, co-chief executive of FNN, saidthat Dow Jones and Group W were &quot;advised&quot; that NBC mightemerge with a last-minute bid because a contract wasn'tsigned. &quot;The NBC offer was conditioned on the fact itwouldn't be made known to anyone except the FNN board or elsethe offer would explode,&quot; said Mr. Hirschfield, who is onleave as managing director of Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co. &quot;Wewere told by our attorneys we had a legal obligation to takethis offer to the FNN board.&quot;   Mr. Hirschfield also characterized the pace of the DowJones-Group W negotiations as too slow, although he said thatwasn't a major contributing factor. He said NBC's offer was&quot;a substantially greater bid.&quot; But Donald Mitzner, presidentof Group W Satellite, said that &quot;we felt we were working veryquickly with a timetable set up by both sides. There wassupposed to be a conclusion&quot; today. Mr. Skinner at Dow Jonesdeclined to comment.   FNN is expected to seek protection from creditors and filea reorganization plan in federal bankruptcy court inManhattan, perhaps as early as Friday. Mr. Hirschfield saidany other bidder, including the Dow Jones-Group Wpartnership, could make another offer, which would then beconsidered by the bankruptcy judge. Mr. Skinner said:&quot;Bankruptcy court is far down the line. Right now we wantaccess to the information and we want to be heard.&quot;   Separately, CNBC also said that Cablevision Systems Corp.will transfer its 49.5% interest in CNBC to NBC. It couldn'tbe determined how much the stake was worth. CNBC saidCablevision wasn't involved in the FNN negotiations andwouldn't participate in the transaction. NBC Cable andCablevision said the relationship would continue byconcentrating on regional sports and other nationalprogramming services, including American Movie Classics,Bravo and SportsChannel America cable channels. Cablevision'srelationship with NBC &quot;remains strong,&quot; said Cablevision'svice chairman, Marc A. Lustgarten.   CNBC is available to 18 million cable subscribers, whileFNN reaches about 35 million subscribers. There are about 10million subscribers who receive both all-business services.   Mr. Mitzner of Group W said that cable operators, as wellas viewers, will be better served with two competingbusiness-oriented cable channels. Therefore, he said, Group Wis exploring the possibility of launching a service, perhapswith Dow Jones, that would challenge the FNN-CNBC service.</TEXT></DOC>
