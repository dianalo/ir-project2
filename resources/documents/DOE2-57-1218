We then describe the way in which a standard is establishedaccording to the basic principles and procedures involved in determiningacceptable environmental concentrations in practice. We refer to theeconomic and political considerations involved in deciding on a standardand, as an example, to the positions adopted by the various parties concernedin France when drafting the 15.05 standard. In response to the atmosphericpollution caused by motor vehicles, all the industrial countries have,some earlier than others, drawn up regulations designed to limit theextent of this pollution, to protect the environment and reduce the publichealth risk. Both environmental and emission standards are aimed at reducingthe risks to the environment and in particular to man, arising from thepresence of particular pollutants. The procedure concerned in establishingthese standards is a complicated one involving scientific, economic andpolitical considerations; furthermore, there is a great diversity ofstandards. 3 figs, 8 refs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
