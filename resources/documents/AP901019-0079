(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A nearly 3-month-old baby was releasedfrom the hospital after recovering from serious heart defects thatonce made him a transplant candidate.   Weston Kilpatrick left Loma Linda University Medical Center ingood condition Wednesday, but still faces the prospect of futuresurgery to repair remaining defects, hospital spokesman DickSchaefer said.   ``We're very excited and cautiously optimistic as we take Westonhome,'' said his father, Layne Kilpatrick, a 31-year-oldpharmacist. ``He's doing well. Although the future is uncertain forWeston, he has amazed us.''   ``Everyone's really excited that Weston can get home in thissort of shape without a transplant,'' said Dr. Steven Gundry, whoperformed surgery to repair some of the defects that didn't heal.   Weston was born July 27. He suffered several congenital cardiacdefects, including underdevelopment of the left side of his heart,underdeveloped heart valves, an open duct between two arteries anda narrowed aorta, which is the main artery carrying blood from theheart to the rest of the body.   Layne and Janet Kilpatrick and their 4-year-old daughter,Danielle, moved from the central California community of Lompoc toRedlands in order to be near their son while he waited for a donorheart.   Gundry repaired the duct and artery problem Oct. 7 after theusually fatal underdevelopment of the heart's left pumping chambergot better on its own. The valves also showed some improvement.That recovery, which doctors called virtually miraculous,eliminated the need for a heart transplant to save Weston's life.   ``Weston has continued to improve,'' Gundry said Wednesday. ``Hestill has problems with one of the valves in his heart and a fewsmall holes in his heart. But right now he's really amazed all ofus.''   Schaefer said the holes allow a small amount of blood to flowbetween chambers of the heart in an unwanted manner and may requirecorrective surgery later.   Loma Linda has become a leading center for newborn human hearttransplants since 1984, when Dr. Leonard Bailey implanted ababoon's heart in the infant known as Baby Fae in an attempt tosave her life. She suffered a more severe underdevelopment of theleft side of her heart.</TEXT></DOC>
