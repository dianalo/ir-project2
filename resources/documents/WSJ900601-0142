K.Y. Yeung, secretary for education and manpower, saidHong Kong will allow as many as 10,000 semiskilled workers toenter this year in addition to 2,000 construction workersalready due to arrive for jobs on a huge airport and portproject.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Yeung said the foreign-worker program is an extensionof one started in April 1989 that allowed for the selectiveintroduction of technicians and skilled laborers from abroad.That program has brought in 2,700 skilled workers. A quota of2,700 for that program also was announced for this year,bringing to 14,700 the total of skilled and semiskilledworkers that may be imported in 1990.   However, Ian Christie, director of the Hong Kong GeneralChamber of Commerce, estimates that there are &quot;at least&quot;165,000 or 170,000 job vacancies in Hong Kong. For threeyears, the chamber and other business associations have beenlobbying for large-scale imports of labor.   &quot;I've got to be pleased that the government has at longlast seen fit to move in the right direction,&quot; Mr. Christiesaid. &quot;But this is only a very small percentage. It isn'tlikely to depress wage increases.&quot;   The tight labor market and rapidly rising wages arefactors in the colony's high inflation of the past two years.Inflation was about 10% in 1989 and ran at a 9.4% annual ratein the first quarter of 1990, according to governmentfigures.   The government says nominal earnings for manufacturingworkers at the end of 1989 were 15% higher than at the end of1988, or 5% higher after inflation. Real, orinflation-adjusted, earnings of service employees were 6%higher, and real earnings of construction workers were up 7%.   The labor-importation program &quot;could have a modest effect&quot;on this wage inflation &quot;if the measures are concentrated onthe critical areas,&quot; said Miron Mushkat, director of regionaleconomic research for Baring Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd.Among the areas most in need of workers are manufacturing,construction and hotels and restaurants, he said.   The 10,000 semiskilled workers -- defined as those with atleast one year's job experience and not in need of vocationaltraining -- are aimed at helping businesses most hurt by thelabor shortage. The government said half the quota isexpected to go to the clothing industry, to wholesale, retailand import-export trades and to hotel, catering andtourism-related businesses.   Labor unions, which have opposed labor imports, argue thatemployers will use foreign workers to undercut local payscales and benefits.   But Mr. Yeung said the government will only considerapplications from employers proposing to pay at least themedian wage for the industry. In addition, employers will berequired to provide housing, medical treatment andtransportation to and from Hong Kong, and imported workerswill have two-year contracts. However, if there are layoffs,the imported workers will be first affected, Mr. Yeung said.   He also repeated a government promise that there will beno &quot;large-scale importation&quot; of unskilled labor into HongKong.   The 2,000 construction workers to be allowed in weredescribed as an &quot;initial&quot; allotment; the project to build aninternational airport and container port is expected torequire more than 20,000 workers by middle of the decade. Themultibilliondollar project is scheduled to be finished by1997, the year Hong Kong is due to revert to Chinese rule.   Local businesses began calling on the government to relaxits rules on imported workers more than three years ago. Atthat time, the colony's factories and businesses were workingnear their capacity, and exports were expanding atdouble-digit rates. The export boom hit as growth in thelabor pool was slowing because of declining birth rates and a1980 cut in immigration from China.   Hong Kong allows the hiring of expatriate managers andprofessionals on a case-by-case basis. It also has allowedthe importation of more than 50,000 domestic helpers ontwo-year contracts.   The government initially resisted calls for importingworkers for other areas, maintaining that the labor shortagewould ease as the economy slowed down. It also said it wantedto ensure that Hong Kong residents gained from the colony'seconomic success. However, the shortage has persisted despitea cooling of the economy that worsened in the wake of lastyear's political turmoil in China.   The government estimates that gross domestic product willincrease 3% in 1990, compared with 2.5% in 1989.   While the number of job vacancies reported has declined insome sectors, it remains high. Last December, the latestreporting date, manufacturers reported 36,200 vacancies, down30% from December 1988. A total of 86,900 vacancies wasreported by major business sectors in December 1989,according to government figures. Private estimates of totalvacancies range up to 200,000.   Hong Kong's unemployment rate rose to 1.7% in the firstquarter of 1990 from an average of 1.35% during 1989. But,economists say, 1.7% still represents a tight labor market.They say 2.5% to 3% unemployment would still be considered&quot;full employment&quot; for Hong Kong.   Further exacerbating the tight labor supply is theincreasing emigration from the colony ahead of the 1997Chinese takeover. According to some estimates, 1,000 peopleare leaving Hong Kong each week.</TEXT></DOC>
