In the case when n=2 and D=3 theremay occur vacuums vertical stroke+ andgt; violating chiral invariance, aswell as vertical stroke- andgt; violating P, T symmetry of the model. At n,D=2 there may exist a phase, where a hierarchy of fermion multiplet massesarises in a dynamical way. The properties of Gross-Neveu model have beendealt with at D=3, n=1 and the temperature and chemical potential notequal to zero.</TEXT></DOC>
