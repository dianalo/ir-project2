Talks recessed at 6:30 a.m. today when negotiators for theCleveland Teachers Union agreed to take the school board's latestproposal to the union's executive board later in the day.   Superintendent Alfred Tutela called off classes for thedistrict's 72,639 students, citing the weather, although no otherarea school districts were closed. Cleveland received up to 3inches of snow overnight.   The district is Ohio's largest public school system.   Union negotiators had set a bargaining deadline of 3 p.m.Wednesday and a strike deadline of midnight, but talks continuedinto early this morning at a downtown hotel under the supervisionof federal mediator Jack Buettner.   Union President Eugene Kolach said teachers would not set uppicket lines outside schools because classes had been canceled. Hedeclined further comment.   The union's executive board agreed to meet at 3 p.m. today toconsider the board's proposal, Buettner said. He declined to saywhether he believed the proposal could lead to a tentative contract.   ``Both sides were probably shooting for higher goals than theywere able to obtain,'' Buettner said. ``There are several stumblingblocks, and I can't really get into a lot of detail.''   The union, which has 5,093 members, has been without a contractsince Sept. 1.   The school system had planned to close schools if a strikematerialized, but continue classes for the district's 3,600 highschool seniors.   Bargainers would not comment on details of the negotiations, butboth sides have differed on the issues of teacher salaries and acareer ladder system.   The latest bargaining session began at 10 a.m. Tuesday andcontinued almost non-stop until 6:30 a.m. today, except for athree-hour break Wednesday night. Buettner shuttled offers back andforth between the bargaining committees, which were in separaterooms at downtown hotel.   Tutela last month urged teachers to accept a mandatory careerladder system that would hinge pay raises to performanceevaluations.   Union negotiators have said they want participation in thecareer ladder to be an option.   The union had been seeking a 5.8 percent wage increase thisyear, while the district was offering a 2 percent one-time bonuspayment. Union negotiators said the amount of the increases couldvary depending on the length of the proposed contract.   Annual salaries for teachers range from $17,687 for beginners to$37,457 for teachers with a master's degree and 35 yearsexperience. The average teacher pay is $29,000.   The union represents classroom teachers, guidance counselors,teacher aides, librarians and reading specialists.   About 40 parents and others staged a demonstration Wednesdayoutside the hotel where talks were being held to encouragecontinued negotiations. The rally was organized by the InterchurchCouncil of Greater Cleveland.</TEXT></DOC>
