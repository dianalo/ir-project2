LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A jury on Tuesday rejected claims by eightformer residents of Times Beach that dioxin in the oil sprayed onthe town's streets had made them ill.   The St. Louis Circuit Court jury said, after deliberating a day,there was no medical evidence to support the claims. The eightrepresented more than 180 plaintiffs in the 7-month-old trial.   Times Beach, a St. Louis County community of 2,400, wasdisincorporated and abandoned five years ago because of dioxincontamination.   The eight residents whose claims were decided Tuesday had beenchosen by Judge Michael J. Hart as representatives of 184 originalplaintiffs in a suit filed against four chemical companies overalleged damages. The suit was one of several filed by Times Beachresidents against the companies.   The test trial was designed to provide guidelines for attorneyson both sides so that future trials could be handled in as short atime as possible, Hart said.   Only two of four chemical companies remained as defendants in thecase. Earlier this month, Syntex USA and Syntex Agribusinessreportedly settled the case for $14 million to be divided among1,230 claimants.   The now-defunct Northeastern Pharmaceutical and Chemical Co. andIndependent Petrochemical Corp. were the remaining defendants.   An attorney for the plaintiffs, Arnold J. Levin, said a decisionon whether to appeal Tuesday's decision had not yet been made. Hesaid he would ask the court to allow him to choose eight newplaintiffs from the original 184 who would more clearly exhibit theinjuries and property losses he said Times Beach residents sufferedfrom the contamination.   But defense attorneys expressed confidence that none of theplaintiffs had illnesses that could be traced to dioxin.   ``They can pick the eight worst _ seven or eight people fromTimes Beach who happen to have cancer _ and I'm confident that we'llbe able to prove that it's in no way connected to dioxin,'' said TedParryman, an attorney for Northeastern Pharmaceutical and Chemical.   Syntex and its predecessor, Hoffman Taff, made a herbicide knownas Agent Orange at a plant in Verona in southwestern Missouri.Dioxin is a waste product of Agent Orange, which was used as adefoliate in Vietnam. Syntex later transferred tanks purportedlycontaining the waste material to Northeastern Pharmaceutical.   Northeastern made hexachlorophene for soaps and toothpaste at theVerona site, with dioxin a waste product of that chemical as well.   Attorneys for the plaintiffs said Northeastern passed the wasteon to Independent Petrochemical, which passed it on to RussellBliss, the waste hauler who sprayed oil containing the dioxin on thestreets in Times Beach more than 15 years ago to keep the dust down.Bliss was not a defendant.   The extent of the contamination in Times Beach was determined in1982, leading the government to close the city the next year andrelocate its residents.</TEXT></DOC>
