Some critics find her vivacious personality and sense of funtiresome or vulgar, her adventurous spirit verging on the reckless.   But royal watchers say the 28-year-old former Sarah Ferguson isa favorite with Queen Elizabeth II.   Prince Andrew, a tall, handsome Royal Navy lieutenant, gained aplayboy reputation during a colorful bachelorhood. It included awell-publicized romance with an American actress, Koo Stark, whoonce appeared in soft-porn movies.   But by the spring of 1986 Andrew was clearly smitten with thered-haired Miss Ferguson. The public were enjoying her lively goodnature and the queen was reported to be greatly relieved thatAndrew had found a suitable wife.   They married at Westminster Abbey July 23, 1986, and became theDuke and Duchess of York. Both were 26.   Sarah Ferguson was a new kind of royal bride.   A sales executive with a graphic arts publishing company whenshe married, she had led a free and independent life that includeda three-year romance with motor-racing figure Paddy McNally, awidower with two sons.   Robust, athletic and outspoken, Sarah was far from the slim,demure and impeccably-groomed English rose that Princess Diana,wife of Prince Charles, typified.   She kept working after her marriage, and although she had givenup her publishing job by early 1988, she planned to do free-lancework.   While Andrew pursued his career as a Royal Navy pilot, his wifelearned to fly a helicopter and a plane so she could share theexperience with him.   The Yorks have rejected the traditional choice of an old statelyhome and are building a new house near Windsor Castle _ in aneo-Tudor style that has drawn some criticism.   Sarah's attempts to find a fashion sense of her own led to somehowling failures, each of which was dissected in the press.   The media also criticized what they saw as the duchess' brashand vulgar behavior during the couple's March U.S. tour,particularly in Los Angeles.   Newspapers were especially critical of the duchess' quip: ``I'llsee you later,'' to a man who yelled out, ``I love you'' at adinner.   When Sarah wore a flamboyant black-and-red gown to a black-tiedinner, Craig Brown of The Sunday Times wrote: ``While the stars ofHollywood dressed in discreet black and stayed in the shadows, downthe stairs walloped someone who looked as if she'd just won thirdprize for her Carmen Miranda impersonation ... at some forgottenresort.''   ``Has the Duchess of York gone too far?'' asked the Observernewspaper.   As Sarah grew heavily pregnant, the tabloids carriedunflattering photos of her and made remarks about her weight.   But the duchess's sense of humor scarcely flagged _ except inMay when a newspaper carried a photo of her father, Maj. RonaldFerguson, emerging from a London massage parlor.   While some newspapers called him Romeo Ronnie and suggested hebe fired from his job as polo manager to Prince Charles, the heirto the throne, and others said the duchess was advised to avoid himin public, Sarah was photographed speaking to her father, worriedly.   The major had become a close friend of the queen's husband,Prince Philip, through their shared interest in polo. Sarah, bornOct. 15, 1959, has known all the queen's children since childhood.   She became a close friend of Diana, who is reported to have donesome matchmaking in Sarah's relationship with Andrew.   Sarah grew up at her family's 18th-century farmhouse set in1,200 acres of rolling Hampshire countryside at Dummer. She waseducated at two local boarding schools, Daneshill and Hurst Lodge,where she was head girl _ the school leader _ excelling at sportsrather than studies.   Sarah's parents divorced when she was 14, and her mother, Susan,married Argentine polo professional Hector Barrantes. They live atTrenque Laughen near Buenos Aires and travel the international polocircuit.   After school, Sarah studied at St. James' secretarial college inLondon. Then it was off to work, first at an apartment rentalagency, then at a Covent Garden art gallery, a sports publicrelations agency and finally as a sales executive with B.C.K.Graphic Arts in fashionable Mayfair.</TEXT></DOC>
