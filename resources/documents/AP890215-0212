Shoppers for loans to finance housing purchases now may encounterthe ``interest only'' mortgage, the 40-year mortgage, or the15-minute mortgage, just to name a few.   In theory, these innovations, born of intense competition amonglenders, provide borrowers with an ever-growing number of options tomake home ownership work to their best advantage.   But financial observers say it is important to separate meregimmicks from good deals, and to concentrate on the total cost of agiven loan.   Forty-year and ``interest only'' mortgages have recently madetheir appearance at a few large big-city lending institutions. Theprime target for both is first-time homebuyers who have to stretchespecially hard to meet monthly payments.   With the ``interest only'' mortgage advertised recently by onebank, the borrower does not begin repaying the principal on the loanuntil the sixth year.   Conceivably, these propositions could provide access to thehousing market for some people who couldn't otherwise qualify.   But analysts point out that the potential benefits of either seemsmall. On a conventional mortgage, very little principal is paidback in the first five years anyway.   And stretching out a loan from the customary 30 years to 40yields a surprisingly small difference in the monthly payment.   On a fixed 30-year, $100,000 mortgage at 10 percent interest, themonthly payment would be $877.57, calculates William Brennan, editorof the Financial Planning Reporter newsletter published by theaccounting firm of Ernst andamp; Whinney.   Extend the term of the loan to 40 years, and the monthly paymentis reduced only to $849.15. The $28.42 difference is ``reallymeaningless,'' Brennan observes.   One cost of this modest benefit is much slower reduction in theunpaid loan balance, leaving the borrower with less equity in theproperty.   After 15 years of payments, the 30-year borrower would haveworked the balance down to $81,644.56, while the 40-year borrowerwould still owe $93.446.16.   With the adjustable-rate mortgages that are common these days,the same dubious tradeoffs apply.   In fact, notes Robert Heady, publisher of several bankingnewsletters in North Palm Beach, Fla., the extra interest a 40-yearborrower pays will increase should rates go up.   On a $100,000 loan at 10.9 percent, he reckons, the 40-yearborrower will wind up paying about $101,600 more in interest thanthe 30-year borrower.   Should the rate increase to 12.9 percent, the difference expandsto about $123,600.   The stretch-out to 40 years means ``inviting a lot of pain downthe road,'' Heady says.   At the other end of the time scale, the 15-minute mortgage is thelatest brainchild of Citicorp, one of the nation's biggestoriginators of home loans.   ``Fifteen-minute,'' of course, refers not to the duration of theloan, but to the time Citicorp says it will take to process amortgage application, rather than the usual three weeks to a month.   According to the company, the 15-minute service will be done witha computer to approve or reject applications transmitted overtelephone lines from the offices of real estate brokers and lawyers.   There may be something to be said for such rapid service,replacing the agonizing wait that aspiring homeowners often endurewhile lending institutions decide their fate.   But financial experts say the speed of processing is a separatequestion from matters that remain important for many years _ inparticular, which lender's mortgage will cost you the least over theperiod in which you expect to own the home.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thursday, Feb 16.</NOTE></DOC>
