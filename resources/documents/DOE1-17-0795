The depth variation of the {sup 37}Arproduction rates in K agrees with that expected from cosmic ray muoninteractions. At shallow depths, the {sup 37}Ar production rates in Kparallel those in Cl, with the {sup 37}Ar rate per ton K equal to the{sup 37}Ar rate per 615 tons of C{sub 2}Cl{sub 4}. At 4850 ft depth,the measurements give 0.07 +- 0.07 {sup 37}Ar day{sup -1} per ton ofK, which is to be compared to the value of 0.46 +- 0.04 {sup 37}Ar day{sup-1} per 615 tons of C{sub 2}Cl{sub 4} in the solar neutrino detector.The production in chlorine at 4850 ft depth; however, the error in theK measurements at 4850 ft depth is presently too large to determine accuratelythe cosmic ray background of the solar neutrino experiment. This errorwill be reduced by additional measurements.</TEXT></DOC>
