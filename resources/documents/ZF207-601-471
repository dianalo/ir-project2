 If your applicationsknow how to use fonts, and if you intend to use nothing but standard fonts,you may not need any font utilities, but some of tehm may prove highlyconvenient.andP;  Even if your applications know how to download fonts, it isalmost always faster to download them before you enter the application.andP;  Fontmanagers (programs that install fonts into applications) and down-loadingutilities let you assemble a set of fonts that you can download to theprinter via a command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.andP;  most of these programs willlet you download individual fonts at any time.andM;Other utilities reviewed here help with installing fonts in applications andin modifying existing fonts without using a font editor.andP;  Some of the bestutilities of this type are included in the SoftCraft Font Solution Pack,reviewed in our article on font generators, also in this issue.andM;Small utilities that give you technical information about fonts are availableon BBSs and information services like compuServe and PC MagNet.andP;  Among themost interesting are DMPLJFNT, which prints out the bitmaps of everycharacter in a font; FONTTABL, which prints out the size, spacing, and otherinformation about a font; LISTFONT, which prints out the full symbol set ofthe font; and FINFO, a small Windows program that displays all the fonts youhave installed in Microsoft Windows.andM;Our reviews cover packages devoted primarily to fonts.andP;  Other LaserJetcontrol programs not reviewed here offer basic font-management anddownloading functions, among them Insight Development's $150 LaserControl((415) 376-9451), Orbit Enterprises' $49.95 E-Z-Set ((213) 469-3405), andPhoenix Technologies/Softstyle's $125 Printworks for Lasers ((800) 367-5600).andM;BackLoaderandM;Roxxolid's $29.95 BackLoader downloads soft fonts to your laser printer inthe background while you get on with your work in the foreground.andP;  You canlet BackLoader do its work quietly from the command line or your AUTOEXEC.BATfile, or you can pop up a small menu window from which to manage your fonts.andM;The program is designed for use with lists of fonts that you prepare inadvance with the help of a well-designed menu that scans your font directoryand lets you mark the ones to include in a list.andM;If you always download the same set of files, this system works well.andP;  If youwant to load different font files, the program makes matters needlesslydifficult.andP;  If you can't remember the exact name of the list you want to use,you're out of luck.andP;  If you do remember it, you have to remember to precedeit with @.andM;BackLoader's menus and messages can be mildly confusing.andP;  When you see amessage asking you &quot;Send to the printer?&quot; and the cursor is next to the nameof a font file, you might reasonably assume that a Yes answer will send thefont to the printer.andP;  It won't.andP;  It tells the printer to select the font asthe default font, something your application should be doing for you.andM;Downloading fonts in the background can be a timesaver, although thefrustration of seeing your foreground work slow down while fonts getdownloaded makes it a mixed blessing.andP;  You can adjust the balance betweenBackLoader's background use of computer time and your own foreground use, butyou may get better results by installing a fast software print buffer likeLaserTools' Lasertorq.andM;BackLoader occupies only 16K of memory and can remove itself from memory whenit's through downloading.andP;  If you choose to keep it in memory, you can use itto send commands to the printer by popping it up and selecting the commandyou want from a list in its window.andP;  But first you have to look in theprinter manual for the right escape codes for each command and write theminto an ASCII file for the window to display.andP;  At least a built-in menu letsyou send a form-feed whenever you need one.andM;ConoFonts ManagerandM;The ConoFonts Manager has some of the clearest menus and the most sensibleprogram logic of any font utility you can find.andP;  You don't need to crack thethin manual to select soft fonts and create printer drivers that will letyour applications use those fonts.andP;  Everything that you see on-screen islucid and efficient.andM;Unfortunately, all these virtues are rendered mostly valueless by thelimitations of what Conographic's $70 font manager can actually do.andP;  It'sdesigned mostly for installing Conographic's own ConoFonts ($125), althoughit recognizes standard fonts from other vendors.andP;  Its support is limited toMicrosoft Word, Version 3.0, WordPerfect versions prior to Version 5.0, andWordStar 2000.andP;  The program creates printer drivers that support only softfonts (hence you can't mix soft fonts and cartridge fonts in the samedriver), and it supports only the ASCII character set.andM;The forthcoming Version 2.0 will be much more agreeable, at least if the betacopy that we looked at matches the version that eventually ships.andP;  Althoughthis new version installs fonts in Word 4.0, it still hasn't got pastWordPerfect 4.2, and doesn't support Microsoft Windows or Ventura Publisher.andO;But it is one of the few installers that bothers to support MultiMateAdvantage II.andM;Version 2.0 recognizes all standard symbol sets and can combine soft fonts inthe same printer driver with the LaserJet's internal fonts.andP;  But it stillwon't let you combine cartridge fonts with soft fonts in one driver.andM;The menus in ConoFonts Manager are among the easiest to use of any fontutility.andP;  They deserve to have a more flexible program behind them.andM;Corel NewFontandM;Advanced PostScript programmers can take an innocent PostScript font andtwist it, shade it, stretch it, run it up a slope, give it a light outline ora dark shadow, and generally make that font wish it had never been born.andP;  Itmay be a good thing for the fonts of the world that the rest of us haven'tbeen able to do that quite so easily.andM;Until now.andP;  Corel Systems' $185 Corel NewFont gives everyone thosetransforming powers.andP;  It lets you create unlimited special effects with anyof the native fonts in a PostScript printer or with any downloadablePostScript font.andP;  Using some supplied samples as a guide, you work your waythrough a menu that specifies all the characteristics of your modified fontand then lets you print out normal, italic, bold, and bold italic samples.andO;When you're satisfied with the result, after an hour or two of trial anderror, you can install the modified font in Ventura Publisher and create ascreen font to match.andM;With type larger than about 20 points, you can achieve some exhilaratingeffects using a 300-dpi Postscript printer.andP;  Anything smaller than that willmake your readers wonder whether you like doing bad things to good fonts.andM;FontToolsandM;If you want to make your readers notice what you have to say, use 2-inch-highcharacters for headlines.andP;  That seems to be the philosophy behind WorthingtonData Solutions' $239 FontTools, a combination font-downloader and TSR thatlets you print enormous block letters on a LaserJet.andM;Stark, oversize characters like the kind FontTools produces--they look likethey could be used on a road sign--are almost impossible to find fromsoft-font suppliers.andP;  FontTools lets you print them from any application.andM;To create these oversize fonts, you have to use two of the three productsthat make up the FontTools combination, FASTfont and BIGfont.andP;  The thirdpart, BARfont, elts you print every standard kind of bar code, including somethat HP's bar-code cartridges can't manage.andM;FASTfont is a font downloader that knows how to slip past DOS to transferfonts at top speed.andP;  Fast as it is, FASTfont's menus and configuration are sohair-curlingly complex that you won't want to use FASTfont with anythingother than its partner, BIGfont.andM;BIGfont itself is a combination of soft fonts (which you download withFASTfont) and a memory-resident utility that intercepts text heading for theprinter and looks for the control codes that tell the program to substitutelarge characters for the ordinary-size characters that your applicationthinks will be printed.andP;  You insert these control codes in any document ortext file.andP;  Any text between the control codes will print in charactersranging from 1/3 inch to 2 inches in size, depending on the code.andP;  The wholeprocedure is much simpler than the manual makes it sound.andM;Hot Lead SpecialandM;Edition/PCLandM;The lead is not merely hot but molten in ISC Industries' Hot Lead SpecialEdition/PCL.andP;  This font-modification utility is probably overpriced at $695,but it gives you fast menu-driven control over transformations that wouldotherwise require hours of work in a font editor.andM;Hot Lead performs standard font-altering tricks without thinking twice.andP;  Fromthe densely packed initial menu, you first choose a font file and then selectwhich of a dozen operations you want to perform on it.andP;  For each operation,you have to enter the parameters in a menu field--for example, the number ofdegrees to slope the font.andP;  After a few seconds, the font is transformed inmemory and you can print a sample or check it on-screen using a fast previewfunction.andP;  If you like the results, you can save the font to disk.andM;Hot Lead's menu selections let you change the size of a font, stretch orsqueeze it horizontally or vertically, slope the characters at any angle,make mirror images, add fill patterns or shadows, put characters in shadedboxes, or combine all these changes into one monstrous new design.andM;If you need only this set of features, you're better off spending $600 lesson SoftCraft's Font Effects.andP;  But Hot Lead adds other features that almostjustify the cost.andP;  You can use it to superimpose two characters (or twofonts) over each other in a variety of subtle ways.andM;Best of all, you can combine characters from up to 20 different fonts into asingle composite font.andP;  This feature allows you to circumvent the LaserJetII's limit of 16 fonts per page.andM;Among its many other functions, Hot Lead lets you turn fonts into ASCII filesin which the bitmaps are represented by rows of asterisks that you can thenedit and turn back into a file.andP;  It's not the same as a mouse-driven fonteditor, but it works.andM;Laser Word ProcessorandM;Tool KitandM;If y ou need one package that contains menu-driven or command-linedownloaders plus font-installation programs for WordPerfect, Microsoft Word,Ventura Publisher, Microsoft Windows, and XyWrite, buy any package of VSSoftware's soft fonts, since the Laser Word Processor Tool Kit comes freewith every order of fonts.andP;  If you don't want the fonts, you can buy thishandy set of font utilities alone for $150.andM;The Laser Word Processor Tool Kit contains some of the best availableutilities for downloading fonts manually or automatically, with optionalprint samples.andP;  For this alone, the package will be indispensable to userswho experiment with fonts.andM;The package's menu-driven installation programs for WordPerfect, Word,Ventura Publisher, Windows, and XyWire are somewhat less indispensable.andP;  Youhave to type in your font and program directories every time you use them,and you have to specify information about the fonts that the program shouldbe able to ascertain from the font itself.andM;Furthermore, if you use the program's WordPerfect utility to installGaramond, Garamond Italic, Garamond Bold, and Garamond Bold Italic from thesame screen, WordPerfect won't realize that these fonts belong together.andO;Thus, when you select one of these fonts in WordPerfect, the menu will showyou four different fonts, all simply named Garamond, and it becomes a matterof sheer luck whether the one you happen to choose turns out to be normal orbold italic.andP;  Experimentation can go too far.andM;Lodestar UtilitiesandM;When you use programs that install fonts in WordPerfect, Microsoft Word,Microsoft Windows, and Ventura Publisher, you get plenty of helpful menus.andO;Presumably, that's because those applications also give you plenty of menus.andM;When you use the $55 Lodestar Utilities to install fonts in XyWrite and NotaBene, you use the DOS command line.andP;  Presumably, that's because XyWrite andNota Bene also use a command line.andP;  But Lodestar's lack of a menu shouldn'tbother you: the program is clear and effective without one.andM;All you do is prepare a list of soft fonts that you want to include in aXyWrite or Nota Bene printer driver.andP;  You then run the installation programwith a set of parameters, and the result is a complete printer driver thatworks just like one of your word processor's own drivers--except that ittakes less space and is more efficient.andP;  If you combine normal, italic, andbold fonts in your list, the installer is smart enough to write a driver thatswitches automatically to the italic font when you tell XyWrite or Nota Beneyou want to use italic.andM;You can combien soft fonts with any HP cartridge fonts in a single driver andcan create drivers for any model of the LaserJet that accepts soft fonts,including the new IID.andP;  A simple command-line option lets you fine-tune linespacing, a feature you won't find in utilities that install fonts in otherprograms.andM;The package adds some useful LaserJet control programs, including one thatlets you download fonts from within XyWrite or Nota Bene.andP;  Like XyWrite andNota Bene, the Lodestar Utilities are swift, efficient, and effective.andM;Polaris Font ControlandM;Polaris Software's $99 font installer, Polaris Font Control, is a giganticprogram with dozens of options, but all its energy, menus, fuss, and furyfinally don't amount to much.andM;Polaris Font Control creates printer drivers only for Versions 3.0 and 4.0 ofWord Perfect and for WordStar 2000.andP;  Once you select which of theseapplications you use, you go to a blank menu that lists 30 available &quot;fontscreens.&quot;andP;  You choose one of these screens and start creating a list offonts.andM;To accomplish this, you laboriously type in the complex filenames of each ofyour fonts.andP;  The program doesn't have the sense to find the filenames foryou, but a Verify option will let you know if you made any typing errors.andP;  Ifyou want to install a font cartridge  in the same printer driver with yoursoft fonts, you have to type in HP's part number for the cartridge.andM;When you're through, the program creates a printer driver.andP;  You can gothrough the whole tedious process once again on another font screen to createanother driver.andP;  When you want to download the fonts associated with aspecific driver, you simply use the driver's number as a parameter on the DOScommand line.andP;  At least one thing about this program is simple to use.andM;Soft Font ManagerandM;No font manager is as simple to use or as pleasant to look at as Human TouchSoftware's $69.95 Soft Font Manager.andM;By pressing a key or two to make a selection from its main menu, you can tellthe Soft Font Manager to scan your font directory, display the informationyou need about the typestyle and size of each font (not merely theuninformative filenames), and store a list of fonts for future use.andP;  Anotherkeystroke or two selects a group of fonts for downloading or stores the namesof those fonts in a file so that they can be downloaded together.andP;  Nooperation requires even one more keystroke than the absolute minimum.andM;The only off note in this program is a menu item that offers to delete fonts.andO;No need to avoid this option: it deletes fonts only from the printer'smemory, not from your disk.andM;The version we reviewed could create printer drivers for Version 4.0 ofMicrosoft Word and Version 4.2 of WordPerfect, both ancient history by now.andO;A new version, due around the time you read this, will support Version 5.0 ofboth programs and add mouse support, keyboard macros, and other new features.andO;The author claims that the new version is even easier to use than the currentversion.andP;  But if it were any easier, you might not even notice that it'sthere.andM;TSR DownloadandM;TSR Download is an inexpensive little program that does exactly what is namesays, either from the DOS command line or from memory.andP;  When you let itreside in memory, Elfring Soft Fonts' $30 utility pops up over yourapplications and displays a small menu that lists your soft fonts by theirobscure filenames.andP;  As you move the cursor around the menu,  the programdisplays the name of the typeface (like Helvetica or Times Roman) as well asits size.andP;  A single keystroke selects the font for downloading to theprinter.andM;TSR Download's set of features partly overlaps that of Roxxolid's Backloaderpackage.andP;  As a memory-resident program it swallows 40K of RAM, a much biggergulp than BackLoader's 16K.andP;  And TSR Download doesn't try to send fonts tothe printer in the background.andP;  But TSR Download is a much morestraighforward program to use.andP;  It includes a built-in menu of printercontrols that will be usefull for those troublesome applications that don'tknow how to control the LaserJet--or for those occasions when you simply wishto copy files to the printer.andP;  And if you don't have any soft fonts todownload, you can buy TSR Download complete with 28 LaserJet soft fonts(Times Roman and Helvetica equivalents in sizes from 8 to 24 points) for $45or with 58 soft fonts for $65.andM;For those who wish to go beyond the capabilities of TSR Download, Elfringalso offers a $35 LaserJet Utility Disk, which has programs to print typesamples from soft fonts or display complete technical infromation about fontfiles.andP;  The disk includes the non-TSR shareware version of Download, which isavailable separately for a $15 registration fee.andP;  Yet another $15 brings youa soft font user's manual that explains the whole subject in clear,easy-to-read English.andM;FACT FILEandM;BackLoader Roxxolid Corp.andP;

 Whenyou're through, you can print the result directly from the graphics programor export it as a graphics file to be printed with your word processor ordesktop publishing program.andM;The most stunning and easiest-to-create typographic effects--and the greatestpossible variety of typefaces--are built into Corel draw, which runs underMicrosoft Windows.andP;  You may never exhaust the possibilities on the 57typeface outlines that come with the $495 program.andP;  But if you do, CorelSystems has a new conversion program, which comes with Version 1.02 of theprogram, that lets Corel Draw use any typeface outline sold by Bitstream,Agfa Compugraphic, Casady andamp; Greene, or Digi-Fonts, as well as any outlineincluded in or created by Publisher's Type foundry.andM;The control that Corel Draw affords you over fonts is impressive.andP;  With onlya few keystrokes, you can command the program to extend one serif whileleaving the rest of a character alone.andP;  You can turn characters intotransparent &quot;windows&quot; over an image.andP;  You can also adjust kerning andintercharacter spacing directly on-screen without entering numbers in adialog box.andP;  If you own a PostScript printer, you can fill characters with afew dozen fill patterns.andP;  And with any printer you can add any kind ofoutline or shadow.andM;Not far behind Corel Draw is GEM Artline ($495), which has comparable powerto reshape individual characters (and parts of characters), but somewhat lessflexibility and range.andP;  GEM Artline comes with built-in fonts and can use anyBitstream outline.andM;Computer Support Corp.'s Arts andamp; Letters Graphics Editor ($695) can alsoreshape anything from text string to parts of individual characters and alterfill patterns and outlines, but it reads only its own fonts.andP;  Theless-powerful Arts andamp; Letters Composer can modify the overall shape ofcharacters but canht divide characters into separate elements for editing.andO;Both programs run under Windows.andM;Adobe Systems' Adobe Illustrator ($695), also a Windows application, canprint text strings with any PostScript font but can modify only characterstaken from two special fonts in which each character is stored in the form ofclip art.andP;  You have to select each character in turn and then manipulate it.andO;Adobe Illustrator lets you do this at about half the speed of other graphicspackages.andM;With a clip art font, you have to select and position each characterindividually.andP;  If you're willing to spend the time to do this, one of thebest sources of clip art fonts is Micrografx's four-volume MicrografxHeadline Typerfaces Library, which costs $79.95 for each volume.andM;Whichever program you choose, remember that your own typographic designskills finally matter more than the power of the program.andP;  The most-powerfulgraphics program can't make a typographic genius out of a typographicbumbler.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
