ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There may be fewer and smaller leveraged buyoutsthese days, but LBOs are still a thriving investment and a popularway to finance corporate acquisitions, economists say.   ``Wall Street is awash in funds,'' said Robert B. Reich,professor of political economics and management at HarvardUniversity's John F. Kennedy School of Government.   ``Financial entrepreneurs are at this moment cooking up avariety of schemes for those funds. ... LBO lovers will be amongthem,'' he said Monday.   Reich and other economists disagreed with a statement by FederalReserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan that LBOs _ in whichcompanies are acquired primarily with borrowed funds _ have reachedtheir peak.   The Fed chairman, who spoke over the weekend to a group of topcorporate executives in Hot Springs, Va., said the number ofdebt-financed takeovers will decline because ``the easiest, obviousones'' already have been done.   ``Greenspan is being overly optimistic,'' said Reich, referringto the fact that the Fed chairman, like many other critics of LBOs,would like to see highly-leveraged transactions subside.   Donald Ratajczk, director of economic forecasting at GeorgiaState University in Atlanta, also disagreed with Greenspan, saying,``I wouldn't say they have peaked _ I would say there's a lull.''   Recent statistics support the theory that LBO activity hasslowed somewhat. The number of leveraged buyouts declined duringthe first quarter to 40 deals of $10 million or more from 57 in ayear earlier, according to Securities Data Co., a New Jersey-basedresearch firm.   Lawrence Chimerine, president of the economic forecastingservice Wefa Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said rising prices andinterest rates and the slowing of the economy may have dampened LBOactivity.   But LBOs are still attractive to investors and takeoverstrategists, many analysts say.   ``The thing that motivated LBOs in large part was the taxsystem,'' said Richard Rahn, chief economist with the U.S. Chamberof Commerce, noting that corporate acquirers enjoy hefty taxdeductions for the interest they pay on LBO loans.   ``That situation still persists,'' Rahn said. ``I would notthink you would have a fundamental change until we had a more basicchange in the tax law.''   Rahn agreed with Greenspan that after LBOs were developed,prospective buyers looked around for the best targets, and withthose companies _ most notably RJR Nabisco Inc. _ there are fewerbuyouts to be made.   But David Wyss, chief financial economist with DRI-McGraw Hillin Lexington, Mass., disagreed. ``There's still some big ones outthere that they could do. There's rumors about almost everythingflying around.   ``No one thought about RJR till it happened,'' Wyss said,adding, ``I'm not as convinced as (Greenspan) is that theenthusiasm is over.''   The $24.53 billion RJR Nabisco deal, engineered by LBOspecialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., focused public attentionon leveraged buyouts and raised concerns among economists _including Greenspan _ about the high level of corporate debt inthis country.   Critics say that in the event of an economic downturn, both thebought-out company and the financiers of the transaction could bejeopardized.   Some economists say large issues of junk bonds used to financedeals like the RJR Nabisco buyout have temporarily glutted themarket, but they expect demand to increase once the new issues arefully absorbed into the system.   ``With the success of RJR, we'll see activity back up again,''said Georgia State's Ratajczk.   Junk bonds have high yields, and institutional investors arestill eager to buy them, Ratajczk said. In the process, theseinvestors help keep the LBO boom alive.</TEXT></DOC>
