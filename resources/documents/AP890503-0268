(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. says aslowdown in attack helicopter production is to blame for theplanned layoff of 450 workers this month, with about the samenumber to follow next year.   President Bill Brown said Tuesday that temporary and regularemployees in all divisions would be cut, including 355 at thecompany's Mesa plant and 95 at its plant in Culver City, Calif.   Brown said those affected would be told by May 12. They willreceive severance pay and help from the company in finding newjobs, he said.   The layoffs and budget cutbacks, which will include cuts in suchareas as advertising and marketing, are expected to save thecompany about $16 million this year, Brown said.   One of Arizona's largest defense contractors, McDonnell Douglashas 5,000 employees at its plant in Mesa and another 3,000 inCulver City.   The company has been building about 10 AH-64 Apache attackhelicopters a month, but the Pentagon has ordered that rate cutback to six a month beginning in June 1990.   McDonnell Douglas has delivered about 460 Apaches on a contractwhich called for 975. But President Bush said two weeks ago inunveiling his defense cuts that the Army now wants only 807, a dropof 168.   It also builds the MD-500 series of light helicopters and avariety of automatic cannons.   ``Due to the two-year length of the production pipeline, we arealready feeling the dropoff in Apache labor required to build thereduced number of helicopters,'' Brown said.   The company may be forced to lay off another 450 employees inMesa and Culver City next year if efforts to further broaden thecompany's business base fall short, Brown said.   About 50 percent of the company's payroll has been based onApache sales, the company has said.   Brown referred to ``encouraging signs that point toward Apachesales as early as this year in Europe or the Middle East.''   He said, however, no contracts had been signed.   ``Nothing counts until someone signs on the dotted line,'' hesaid.   Supporters of the Apache contend that reductions in nuclearweapons, particularly in Europe, have made the anti-tank helicoptermore important than ever.   However, the Apache suffered a major setback earlier this yearwhen the commander of the Army's 82nd Aviation Brigade at FortBragg, N.C., complained that it was unreliable. He said all 12 ofthe Apaches in his unit were incapacitated at points during a warexercise, and only five were in operating condition at the end.   Brown denied there is a problem with the Apache's reliability,emphasizing that difficulties experienced with keeping thehelicopter flying during war games and training were not safetyrelated.   ``The Army has a shortfall of maintenance people,'' he said.   Despite the layoffs, the company will continue to invest heavilyin research and development as it pursues development of new,advanced, civilian and military helicopters, Brown said.   ``We're not going to compromise our future,'' he said.   McDonnell Douglas plans to hire about 100 engineers andtechnical specialists this year to help with development of itsseven-passenger MDX commercial helicopter and the Army's proposedLHX scout-attack helicopter.</TEXT></DOC>
