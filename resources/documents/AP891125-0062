But when they return from their two-month-long holiday break,election year pressures will make tough legislative issues likedeficit reduction and campaign finance reform even tougher to solvein the second session of the 101st Congress than they were in thefirst.   ``This is an incomplete Congress,'' said House Republican WhipNewt Gingrich of Georgia. ``And I think we won't know until the endof next year whether it's a good Congress.''   The Senate started the year with a new chief, Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell of Maine.   Then, nearly halfway through the year, the House had to get newleadership when Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Majority Whip TonyCoelho, D-Calif., resigned. Wright was accused of ethics violationsin his personal finances, and Coelho quit rather than face asimilar inquiry from the House ethics committee.   Gingrich, who was Wright's chief accuser, climbed into the No. 2spot among House Republicans when Dick Cheney resigned to becomeSecretary of Defense.   ``I can't recall any year having seen such turmoil,'' said Rep.Dale Kildee, D-Mich., a 13-year House veteran. ``The new leadershipis just beginning to feel its way. ... It's been a salvage andrepair operation.''   House and Senate leaders at year's end pushed through a raise inthe minimum wage, new spending to fight drugs, aid to Poland andHungary and a controversial pay raise and ethics package. A planwas approved to bail out and re-regulate the savings and loanindustry, at a cost to taxpayers of perhaps hundreds of billions ofdollars in the next few years.   But completion of many other issues was left for the nextsession. Among the major ones: clean air, child care and campaignfinance reform.   President Bush proposed campaign reforms and a bipartisan Housetask force worked on the issue. But agreements were elusive, aseach party pushed for advantage.   Foley and Mitchell list campaign reform as a top priority forthe new year, but Mitchell said he was not optimistic.   ``We have to change the method, the system, by which we electpublic officials in our society and by which we finance and conductcampaigns,'' he said, renewing his call for public financing.   Mitchell said he also plans to introduce legislation to providelong term health care for the elderly. But he's not optimisticabout that one either _ given how Congress just repealed theMedicare catastrophic illness coverage.   ``There is understandable reluctance on the part of members ofCongress to get into this issue, having just been burned,'' he said.   Congress every year gets into the issue of deficit reduction,and this year was typical in that the legislation approved won'tsolve the long-term problem.   Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, senior Republican on the HouseBudget Committee, said the inexperience of the Democratic leadershurt this year's efforts at deficit reduction.   ``We had two new leaders this year who were not dry behind theears before plunging into (budget) summitry,'' Frenzel said.   ``They will be far more effective next year. They're going to beable to exercise a lot more discipline. The leaders have to be ableto enforce the agreements.''   But there also will be ``factors out there not working today,''he said. ``The election year will make our work immeasurably moredifficult.''   Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., said one of the best things theDemocratic leaders did was get Congress out before Thanksgiving togive themselves time to regroup.   ``We need this time to reflect, to see if we can come up with alegislative agenda,'' he said.   ``It has been a long year. I think the membership isexhausted,'' said Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla.   But Synar was more optimistic about next year, foreseeingsuccess likely on long-delayed legislation on child care, clean airand the campaign finance issue.   ``We get a `C' for the first session,'' he said. ``But we canimprove the grade with a make-up in the first three months'' ofnext year,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
