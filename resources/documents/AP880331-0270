The shift lock ``has been recognized worldwide asthe best device available to prevent unintended acceleration,''Audi said Wednesday.   The automaker made its comments as part of a report in which itsaid it had received nearly 400 complaints about the shift lock.   The lock prevents drivers from shifting out of park unless afoot is on the brake pedal. A car's engine cannot overcome itsbrake, nor can a defect in the engine or transmission affect thebrake system because the systems are not connected.   Following studies of reports of unintended acceleration in theAudi car and in vehicles by many other automakers including GeneralMotors Corp. and Mercedes-Benz, the National Highway Traffic SafetyAdministration labeled it an industry-wide phenomenon apparentlycaused by driver error.   The shift lock prevents drivers from making the error _ hittingthe gas pedal instead of the brake. Most Japanese automakers areplanning to install them as standard equipment.   Audi said critics' attempts to discredit the shift lock serve asattempts to prevent drivers from increasing their awareness ofwhich pedal they are stepping on.   In a report to the NHTSA, Audi submitted an analysis of thedevice's performance and information on 396 consumer complaintsreceived on models with shift locks.   Audi installed shift locks on 1978-1986 models during a recallthat began in September 1986 and remains in effect. It includedthem as standard equipment on 1987 and 1988 models.   Of the 396 compaints, Audi said, all but 22 did not fit thepattern of unintended acceleration. Of the 22, 15 involvedimproperly installed shift locks. In the other seven cases, driversshifted into gear from neutral instead of park.   The device has no effect when the car is in neutral. In all 22cases, tests found the brakes functioned properly, Audi said.   Audi said it has received no complaints of sudden accelerationin 1988 models. It received 16 complaints on 1987 models, but noneproved to be cases of sudden acceleration, Audi said.   Audi said it has installed shift locks on more than 170,000cars, including 93 percent of its 1984-1986 fleet and 38 percent ofits 1978-1983 fleet.   ``Both Audi and the federal agency continue to urge all ownersof cars which have not yet responded to make dealer appointments asquickly as possible,'' the company said.   ``The automatic shift lock is an effective cure,'' Audi said inthe conclusion of its report to NHTSA. ``Accident records andinsurance statistics demonstrate that the Audi 5000 is among thesafest cars in the United States.''</TEXT></DOC>
