Among the reasons for the run-up wereexpectations that sluggish oil demand would rebound as winterapproached and national economies recovered. In addition,there was uncertainty over the supply outlook as theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries produced nearcapacity and the Soviet Union's oil exports declined.   Still, some analysts have suggested that on a fundamentalbasis, prices may have gone up too far, and new estimatesindicate that demand may not rise as quickly as previouslybelieved.   Traders said technical factors accounted for some of themomentum of yesterday's sell-off as prices fell throughimportant resistance levels. But underscoring the market'snew weakness was the fact that neither storms in the NorthSea, which interrupted tanker loadings, nor the early coldweather in the U.S., which increased use of heating fuels,gave it any pricing support.   Apparently contributing to the bearish sentiment was aspeech in London by Nordine Ait Laoussine, Algeria's oilminister, who called for a cut in OPEC production to counterthe resumption of oil exports by Kuwait and Iraq. &quot;The needto cut is inevitable&quot; if OPEC is to avoid price weakness, hesaid.   This has been said before, but analysts such as PeterBeutel of the Pegasus Econometric Group suggested that Mr.Ait Laoussine's remarks drew attention to the emerging newfocus in the market. &quot;With this big down day, we have seen achange in direction,&quot; Mr. Beutel said.   In the European cash market, spot prices of the NorthSea's Brent blend crude were down 45 cents to 50 cents abarrel. On London's International Petroleum Exchange, Brentblend futures closed 27 cents to 39 cents a barrel lower. ButU.S. oil prices appeared to set the pace.   In the U.S., some petroleum refiners yesterday reducedtheir field postings for crude oil by around 50 cents abarrel. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the futuresprice of crude oil for December delivery settled 43 centslower at $22.58 a barrel.   December heating oil fell two cents to 67.57 cents agallon. But gasoline was hit the hardest, with the Decembercontract dropping 2.30 cents to 62.59 cents a gallon.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Grain futures prices declined onpessimism about Soviet creditworthiness ahead of a majorcrop-production report due for release today. It was reportedyesterday that Soviet world debt was up to $81 billion,rather than the $65 billion that many analysts had estimated,which might make it difficult for the Soviet Union to borrowmoney to buy grain. Soybeans for January delivery fell 7.25cents to $5.4750 a bushel; the December corn contractdeclined two cents to $2.43 a bushel; and December wheat wasdown 3.50 cents to $3.4750 a bushel.                                                                                                          COPPER: A dreary economic outlook and selling based ontechnical factors sent futures prices tumbling. Copper forNovember delivery ended 1.45 cents a pound lower at $1.0435;the actively traded December contract lost 1.40 cents,finishing at $1.04. The economy's weakness is raising concernabout demand for copper through the end of the year, saidMike Frawley, metals trader at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. inNew York. John Gross, metals consultant in West Nyack, N.Y.,said copper prices above $1 are relatively healthy and seemto be moved more by technical considerations than economicdevelopments. &quot;Copper has been in a world of its own, heldaloft by large speculative players,&quot; he said. Late lastmonth, December copper climbed above $1.08 on technicallybased buying, but when further buying failed to materializeand the rally stalled, technically based selling took over,he said. Also hurting prices yesterday were reports of atentative labor agreement reached over the weekend atCanada's Highland Valley mine, traders said.                                                                                                          COTTON: Futures prices fell amid expectations thegovernment will raise its estimate of this year's crop in areport today. After setting a life-of-contract low, cottonfor December delivery ended 0.85 cent lower at 57.67 cents.Predictions for the crop among market and industry analystsrange from 17.5 million bales to 18.3 million, with theaverage at about 18 million, said Ernest Simon, cottonspecialist at Prudential Securities Inc. Last month, theAgriculture Department estimated the crop at 17.6 millionbales, up sharply from last year's harvest of 15.5 millionbales. This year's crop is expected to be the largest sincethe 1930s and the second largest in U.S. history. SandraKaul, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said sheexpects attention in the next several weeks to shift awayfrom the harvest to demand prospects, adding that prices tendto hit bottom in November or December.</TEXT></DOC>
