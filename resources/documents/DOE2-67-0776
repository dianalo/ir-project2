<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-67-0776 </DOCNO><TEXT>Using a constant-pressure molecular-dynamics simulation, we have investigatedthe thermodynamics and the dynamics of a two-dimensional diatomic-molecularmonolayer undergoing a ferroelastic phase transition. This system closelyresembles the {delta} phase of oxygen molecules adsorbed on a graphitesurface. For Lennard-Jones parameters appropriate for the oxygen molecules,we find a first-order transition from an orientationally ordered distortedtriangular structure (ferro- elastic phase) to an orientationally disorderedequilateral triangular structure (paraelastic phase). The transitiontemperature is 20.1 K compared with 26 K for oxygen on graphite [coverage{approx_equal}8 molecules (100 A{sup 2} )] and the entropy associatedwith this transition is 0.88k/sub B/. The orientational diffusion constantincreases by a factor of 30 at the transition. In addition, there isa strong softening of the elastic constants near the transition, particularlyin the paraelastic phase; this can be understood in terms of translation-rotationcoupling. Comparison between phonon frequencies for certain symmetrydirections obtained by using quasiharmonic approximation and molecular-dynamicssimulation clearly shows the presence of large anharmonicity effectsin the paraelastic phase. A rapid quench from the high-temperature phaseto very low temperatures indicates the presence of small clusters (consistingof 6--12 molecules) with both ferroelastic and herringbone ordering.In addition, we find a large density of equilateral triangular plaquettes.These give rise to a three-peak structure in the center-of-mass radialdistribution function.</TEXT></DOC>
