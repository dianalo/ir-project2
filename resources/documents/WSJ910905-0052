And the computerindustry in the 1990s.</LP><TEXT>   Computers, except for the biggest machines, are becomingcommodities that customers buy as cheaply as possible. Andthe computer industry will never be the same again. While therecession has aggravated the problems, analysts predict thatcommodity pricing will keep plaguing the companies untiltheir number has dropped considerably.   &quot;Profitability of every sector of the computer industrynow is under pressure or becoming nonexistent,&quot; says BarryBosak, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. Andwith the companies constantly leapfrogging each other withmachines that run the same software, the industry iscondemned to ceaseless innovation, price cutting and productcycles that are nasty, brutish and short.   The ever-more-rapid pace of innovation is demonstrated bySun Microsystems Inc., which has spurred many of the changes.Sun introduced eight generations of computers in its 91/2-year existence. In the old days, product cycles tookthree to five years, and companies had plenty of time torecoup research and development costs.   Instead of having twice the profit margin on sales ofaverage industrial companies, as they did in 1984, computercompanies now have returns 20% lower than average, McKinsey andamp;Co. consultants calculate. Over the past five years, profitmargins for the 11 largest U.S. computer companies averagedjust 6.5%; in the previous five years, they averaged 11.5%,Technology Research Corp. says.   All that dismays a business that just 10 years ago -- whenAmericans were smarting at their loss of leadership in steeland machine tools -- was hailed as the model of U.S.industrial success.   The changes are good for buyers, which enjoy the fruits ofinnovation and the ability to play computer makers offagainst one another to get lower prices. Software makers,which can easily differentiate their products, benefitbecause their programs run on a wider variety of computers.The business of helping companies integrate various kinds ofcomputers into networks is growing.   Meanwhile, virtually every computer maker is trying toreinvent itself. Wang Laboratories Inc. is offering to sellInternational Business Machines Corp. computers instead ofits own models. Prime Computer Inc. is moving to become acomputerized-design software company instead of a hardwaremaker. Digital Equipment Corp. is relying on outsidecompanies to develop both the operating system and themicroprocessor brains of its high-powered workstations. AndIBM is asking archrival Apple Computer Inc. for help indesigning its future desktop systems.   These companies have ample reason to change. With pricesfalling so fast, Pier Carlo Falotti, who heads Digital's bigEuropean operations, complains, &quot;We have to sell 70% more{unit} volume every year just to stay even in revenue.&quot;Companies such as IBM, Digital and Compaq Computer Inc., longaccustomed to double-digit sales growth and profit margins,now often report shrinking computer revenue and paper-thinprofits -- and huge restructuring charges.   For workers, computer companies once offered lifetimejobs, generous benefits and ample opportunity for advancementin a white-collar environment. Today, even profitablecompanies are laying people off, and money-losers such asUnisys Corp. and Wang are cutting staffs to barely half theirpeak levels. Computer industry jobs fell 4.3% last year to424,000 -- the 1980 total.   But the computer industry differs from others in the U.S.that turned from leaders to laggards: Vicious competitionamong U.S. companies themselves, rather than from foreignrivals, is causing most of the pain. And compared with otherU.S. industries, &quot;the computer industry is five years aheadof the curve in realizing it has to hold onto market share,&quot;says Ira Magaziner, a Providence, R.I., consultant.   But holding on is likely to produce skimpier and skimpierprofits. For one thing, the ability to build computerhardware, once scarce, has become commonplace. Hundreds ofcompanies are building powerful personal computers, not justin Silicon Valley and Japan but also in Korea and Taiwan --and North Sioux City, S.D.   The PC has become a commodity because Intel Corp., whichmakes microprocessors (the PC's brains), and Microsoft Inc.,which makes the operating system software, are in effectmonopolies that sell their technologies to practically allcomers. The companies that assemble PCs from those componentspress suppliers of all other parts -- screens and disk drivesand memory chips -- to slash prices and push technology.   The upshot: With most buyers looking primarily at price,IBM and Compaq, the high-priced market leaders, had to slashtheir PC prices earlier this year.   Now, the commodity battlefront is moving up to moreexpensive, sophisticated workstations that use the UNIXoperating system. UNIX, developed by American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co., has become the standard because it works onall the computer makers' fastest workstations. At one time,customers were afraid to mix in computers that wereincompatible with a proprietary operating system, and theywaited patiently until their vendor caught up withcompetitors. Now, every time a workstation maker leapfrogsthe competition with higher speed or a lower price, manycustomers switch.   Although various versions of UNIX differ a bit, they aresimilar enough that software vendors can make applicationsfor one system work with another. Parametric TechnologyCorp., of Waltham, Mass., brings out new versions of itscomputerized design software on seven different UNIXworkstations within a few weeks every time it upgrades theproduct.   &quot;We're enjoying the workstation wars today.`Can-you-top-this?' goes on constantly,&quot; says Roger Herman ofITT Corp.'s aerospace communications division, a user ofParametric's Pro Engineer. At Northern Telecom's Ottawaengineering department, Marc Dulude, a manager, comments, &quot;Atany particular time, the choice comes down toprice-performance.&quot; Engineers designing everything fromswitch cabinets to telephone handsets used to work onterminals hooked to IBM mainframes. Three years ago, Northernswitched to Pro Engineer on workstations and now buys fromSun, Silicon Graphics Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co.   Makers of bigger computers haven't reached the commoditystage. Companies with IBM mainframes find it expensive torewrite all their software to run on UNIX-based mainframes.But software developers are writing more and more softwareprograms for the UNIX operating system, and some customersare tempted by cheaper standard systems. And makers ofUNIX-based computers that create one powerful system fromseveral microprocessors offer equal power at a fraction ofmainframe prices.   Two years ago, Richard Cascio, chief financial officer atJFK Medical Center in Atlantis, Fla., decided to replace histwo-year-old, $2 million IBM 3090 mainframe with six DataGeneral Corp. UNIX-based Aviion computers costing a total of$700,000. &quot;In the first year, the pure bottom-line savingsare $800,000,&quot; he says. In addition to the cost benefits, theAviion systems are easier to use and can be kept running moreconsistently, he says.   In terms of pricing pressure, &quot;it's devastating,&quot; saysJohn Levinson, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;Chiefinformation officers, and more importantly the board room,now understand that open systems are a lot cheaper and moreflexible and don't lock you in.&quot; Makers of proprietarymidrange and mainframe computers have to discount list pricessharply to keep existing customers.   The pressures on mainframes will worsen as engineersfigure out how to use multiprocessor UNIX computers to runhuge data bases such as airline reservation systems and bigbanks' customer accounts. Oracle Corp., the leadingindependent maker of data-base software, recentlydemonstrated that it could run its data base on a $1.7million nCUBE Corp. supercomputer at about 1,000 transactionsper second -- half the speed of the fastest onlinetransaction-processing software on one of IBM's biggest, $20million mainframes. Moreover, Oracle's data base is moreflexible and easier to program.   The lower prices for computer systems have badly hurtproprietary-system makers accustomed to high gross margins.   Russell Planitzer, chairman of Prime Computer, longinglyrecalls the days when a mid-range Prime 50 costing $300,000carried a 65% gross margin-profit before taxes, interest andoverhead as a percentage of price. If a salesman sold four ofthem a year, Prime had a gross profit of $780,000. &quot;Theequivalent performance in our UNIX family has a $150,000price tag and a 40% gross margin,&quot; Mr. Planitzer says. Tobring in a $780,000 gross profit, the salesman would have tosell 13 systems a year, Mr. Planitzer calculates.   Some PC companies have adjusted to the new economics byavoiding the expense of big sales forces, holding down Randamp;Dspending to less than half the computer-industry norm of 10%,and accepting after-tax profit margins under 5%. But forlarger systems, most companies believe that Randamp;D spending mustremain high, and they cut costs elsewhere.   Analysts say Sun Microsystems is virtually the only bigmaker of more-powerful computers that has a business modelfully geared to the commodity hardware business. Sun, foundedin 1981, embraced the UNIX standard from the beginning,buying almost all parts rather than designing and buildingthem itself. It also didn't set up multiple factories. &quot;Webuilt this company from scratch using a business model thatdidn't involve much infrastructure or employees,&quot; saysLawrence W. Hambly, Sun's vice president of marketing.   Sun accepts a profit margin well under historic industrynorms. In its recently completed fourth quarter, Sun's profitmargin hit a three-year high of 7% -- anemic by the standardsof the industry winners in the 1970s. But because investmenthas been so low, its return on equity was 18%, well aboveaverage for U.S. companies. With 12,500 workers and $3.2billion in sales, Sun has one-quarter the sales and one-tenththe employees that Digital does. &quot;Sun invented the neweconomics of computing,&quot; says an admiring Mr. Planitzer.   Most older vendors are trying to copy Sun's approach fortheir industry-standard products: buying parts fromsuppliers, cutting costs and producing new products annually.Most hope to continue selling high-profit proprietary systemsto existing customers for a few more years. However, almostall of them are holding onto those customers by promising tohelp them switch to UNIX in the future.   Only a few companies will have the economies of scale tobuild UNIX computers profitably. The rest will buy them andadd software or hardware enhancements before reselling them,as Prime and Wang already do. Steven Milunovich, an analystat First Boston Corp., predicts that by the end of thedecade, there will be only three European computer makers,four or five Japanese makers and four to six large U.S.manufacturers. &quot;I can't help but be negative about the wholehardware industry,&quot; he says.   Besides helping computer buyers, all that change spellsopportunity for consulting and integration companies such asthe consulting arm of Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. and GeneralMotors Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems subsidiary. And manysoftware companies are doing well; their customers don't wantto switch software once they have learned one program. Infact, most hardware companies are trying to build their ownsoftware and integration-services business; Digital getsabout 40% of its revenue from those areas.   For most hardware companies, the changes are crippling,although a few have made the adjustment. Analysts sayHewlett-Packard and ATandamp;T's NCR Corp. have stayed profitablewhile moving to UNIX. Data General has stabilized itsproprietary-system sales while expanding its UNIX business.   The industry's giants, IBM and Digital Equipment, arebetting that customers will continue to want theirproprietary mid-range and mainframe computers and will payhigh prices for them. This fall, IBM is introducing a newline of mainframes that many analysts predict will strengthenits profits. But Mr. Milunovich says a First Boston surveyfinds some customers loath to buy big mainframes.   Digital Equipment has taken a different course: It buyseither its PC and workstation lines or their core technologyfrom others. This year, it helped set up a group ofcompanies, including microprocessor designer MIPS ComputerSystems Inc. and PC maker Compaq, that will rely onMIPS-designed microprocessors and a version of UNIX concoctedby Santa Cruz Operations Inc., a software firm, for theirfuture UNIX workstations.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          STEVEN MILUNOVICH is a stock analyst who follows thecomputer industry for Salomon Brothers.
