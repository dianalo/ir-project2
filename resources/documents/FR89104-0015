Subsequent actions taken withregard to the conditions of approval and proposed program amendments canbe found at 30 CFR 913.11, 913.15, 913.16 and 913.17.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Submission and Review of Amendment</ITAG>By letter dated March 28, 1986 (Administrative Record No. IL-1028), Illinoisproposed extensive revisions to virtually all the regulations containedwithin its program. OSMRE announced receipt of and solicited public commenton the proposed amendments by notice published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on May 9, 1986 (51 FR 23858).By letter dated July 22, 1986 (Administrative Record No. IL-1038), OSMREnotified Illinois of certain areas in which the proposed amendments appearedto be less effective than the Federal regulations or in conflict with thedecisions of the United States District Court for the District of Columbiain <T3>In re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation (II) </T3>(CivilAction No. 79-1144, D.D.C. 1984 and 1985), hereinafter referred to as <T3>In re: Permanent II. </T3>Illinois subsequently revised and resubmittedthe amendments on May 22, 1987 (Administrative Record No. IL-1029A). OSMREannounced the resubmission and reopened the public comment period by noticepublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 26, 1987 (52 FR 24035). Extensive publiccomments were received in response to both notices; however, since no onerequested a public hearing, none was held.With minor exceptions, OSMRE approved these amendments on October 25, 1988(53 FR 43112). However, in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> decision notice published on that date, the Directortemporarily deferred a decision on the proposed definition of VER in 62IAC Part 1701 until further public comment could be sought on the additionalinformation resulting from a meeting of Illinois, OSMRE and Interior officialson October 17, 1988. At that meeting the State advanced further argumentsfor approval of the definition (Administrative Record No. IL-1056). OSMREsimultaneously published a notice reopening the comment period on thisdefinition until November 9, 1988 (53 FR 42973, October 25, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Director's Findings</ITAG>Background on DefinitionIllinois proposed to revise the definition of valid existing rights in62 IAC 1701. Appendix A (also known as 62 IAC 1701.5) to resemble the languagein the corresponding Federal definition at 30 CFR 761.5, as promulgatedon September 14, 1983. However, on March 22, 1985, in <T3>In re: Permanent II, </T3>the U.S. District Court for the Districtof Columbia remanded portions of this definition to the Secretary becausehe had failed to provide the public with adequate notice and opportunityto comment on the revised provisions. The remanded portions of the definitioninclude those provisions of paragraphs (a) and (d) which would authorizeuse of the ``takings'' test to determine whether a person possesses VER.The court also remanded paragraph (c) to the extent that it would expandVER under the ``needed for an adjacent'' test to include lands for whichthe claimant had not acquired the necessary property rights prior to August3, 1977. For further explanation of these terms and the court's decision,see the preamble to the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice suspending these portions of the Federaldefinition (51 FR 41954-41955, November 20, 1986).The Illinois program as approved on June 1, 1982, and reviewed again onApril 5, 1984, 49 FR 13494, contained provisions similar to those remandedby the Federal court. The approval of these provisions was subsequentlyupheld by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois(<T3>Illinois South Project </T3>v. <T3>Watt, </T3>C.A. 82-2229), based on the September 14, 1983, revisionsto the Federal definition. However, the plaintiffs appealed this decisionand on March 30, 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuitruled that an approval based on a defective (remanded) Federal regulationcannot stand (<T3>Illinois South Project </T3>v. <T3>Hodel, </T3>C.A. 87-2366, hereinafter referred to as <T3>ISP v. </T3><T3>Hodel</T3>). The Appeals Court ordered the District Court to remandthe approval of the Illinois VER definition to the Secretary for reconsiderationunder whatever regulation is currently in force. The District Court remandedthe issue on June 22, 1988.Finding 1: Takings TestIllinois and the National Coal Association originally challenged the March13, 1979, Federal definition of VER on the grounds that it violated theCongressional intent that VER encompass property rights recognized as validunder State case law. In <T3>In re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation I</T3> (CivilAction No. 79-1144, February 26, 1980), the U.S. District Court for theDistrict of Columbia found ample support for this contention and the Secretaryconceded the point. The court further noted that the Secretary's actionrendered moot Illinois' objection that the Federal rules directed the regulatoryauthority to determine the existence of VER without referrence to applicableState court decisions on property rights. Therefore, by implications, SMCRArequires that VER be determined (and defined) in accordance with Statecase law.In the case of Illinois, the Secretary has previously accepted the State'sargument that its use of a takings analysis in determining VER is appropriateand necessary under Section 15, Article 1 of the Illinois Constitutionas construed by the Illinois courts (Finding 30.2; 47 FR 23866, June 1,1982, with further discussion at 49 FR 13499, April 5, 1984). Federal caselaw and the regulatory development of the Federal VER definition on thispoint have not changed.For the reasons set forth in this preamble, the Director continues to findthat inclusion of a takings test within the Illinois definition of VERis consistent with section 522(e) of SMCRA as interpreted by the U.S. DistrictCourt.When the U.S. District Court in <T3>In re: Permanent II</T3> remanded those portions of the 1983 FederalVER definition authorizing use of the takings test on March 22, 1985, itdid so on procedural rather than substantive grounds. Consequently, whilethe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in <T3>ISP v. Hodel,</T3> remanded OSMRE's approval of the Illinois definitionto the extent that the approval was based on the remanded 1983 Federaldefinition, it did not preclude or prohibit OSMRE from approving the takingstest as part of the Illinois definition. Indeed, the court noted in itsopinion that ``perhaps the Secretary could have approved Illinois' proposalunder the 1979 regulation, but he did not'' (Mem. op. at 5). The courtfurther specified that any substantive decision would have to be basedon those portions of the 1979 Federal definition which regained currencyfollowing the remand of the 1983 definition which, for the purpose of thisfinding, means the good faith all permits test. See 45 FR 51548 (August4, 1980).As discussed at 43 FR 14992, March 13, 1979, the legislative history ofSMCRA clearly indicates that one intent of Congress in providing the VERexemption from the prohibitions and limitations of section 522(e) of SMCRAwas to avoid a regulatory taking of property for which compensation wouldhave to be paid under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.In 1979, OSMRE's preamble to the definition of VER stated that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The legislative history of the Act indicates that Congress wantedto avoid any taking in the implementation of section 522(e) (CongressionalRecord, April 20, 1977, H-3827). There Congressman Udall opposed an amendmentto delete the VER clause from the Act. He stated that if VER were deleted,the Act would not preserve valid legal rights which could not be done without``paying compensation under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.''Thus, OSM has endeavored to determine the point at which payment wouldbe required because a taking had occurred, then to define ``valid existingrights'' in those terms, i.e., those rights which cannot be affected withoutpaying compensation. * * * OSM has concluded that VER could be definedin a variety of ways and still avoid an unconstitutional taking. OSM recognizes,however, that in deciding the validity of this definition, the courts willfocus on particular fact situations, including how much harm would be causedby the mining operation and whether the property owner still has some reasonableremaining use of the land. (44 FR 14992, March 13, 1979.)</ITAG>Furthermore, OSMRE explained the 1979 definition of VER as more open-endedthan adherence to a rigid ``good faith all permits'' test:<ITAG tagnum="21">OSM believes, however, that VER is a site-specific concept which canbe fairly applied only by taking into account the particular circumstancesof each permit applicant. OSM considered not defining VER, which wouldleave questions concerning VER to be answered by the States, the Secretaryand the courts at later times. Without a definition, however, many interpretationsof VER would be made and no doubt challenged by both operators and citizens;and once valid existing rights determinations are challenged, the permittingprocess would be delayed. OSM has therefore concluded that VER should bedefined in order to achieve a measure of consistency in interpreting thisimportant exemption. Under the final definition, VER must be applied ona case-by-case basis, except that there should be no question about thepresence of VER where an applicant had all permits for the area as of August3, 1977. (<T3>Id.</T3> at 14993.)</ITAG>OSMRE summarized the 1979 definition by stating:<ITAG tagnum="21">In summary, OSM's final definition of VER is designed to avoid a takingwhich must be compensated and to be consistent with the guidance of thelegislative history on this issue. (<T3>Id.</T3> at 14994.)</ITAG>In determining whether a state regulation is no less effective than theSecretary's rule, the Secretary must first determine what is sought tobe achieved by the Secretary's rule.If the Secretary's rule has but one purpose, then the comparison is relativelystraightforward. In such circumstances it involves determining whetherthe State rule is likely to be as successful as the Federal rule in accomplishingthe singular purpose intended.When more than one purpose is served by the Secretary's rule and the pertinentprovision of the statute, and where the purposes may seemingly conflict,the comparison between the Secretary's rule and the State rule involvesbalancing the overall effect of the two rules. In such circumstances, onerule may be more effective than the other in achieving one of the purposes,but less effective in achieving the other purpose. On an overall basis,however, one rule may be no less effective than the other in achievingall of the purposes of SMCRA regardless of whether an equivalence existsin achieving each individual purpose.Section 522(e) of SMCRA is a section with more than one purpose. Althoughone intent of that section is to protect the areas enumerated in paragraphs(e)(1) through (e)(5) from the adverse effects of surface coal mining operations,a second central theme of that section is to recognize and to preservevalid property rights. A third theme is to avoid takings of property thatwould require compensation under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.These latter two purposes were expressly acknowledged by the U.S. Courtof Appeals for the DC Circuit in a recent opinion concerning the validityof a portion of the Secretary's VER definition not involved in this proceeding.The court emphasized that the mining prohibitions of section 522(e) arenot to be applied in a manner that interferes with property rights andstated that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Congress, however, limited the application of the surface mining proscriptionsto avoid the infringement of existing property rights. (<T3>National Wildlife Federation (NWF) v. Hodel,</T3> 839 F.2d 694, 749(D.C. Cir. 1988).)</ITAG>After stating that ``[n]either the statutory language nor the legislativehistory elaborate on the meaning of the phrase `valid existing rights,''' the Court of Appeals concluded that the legislative history ``does suggestthat <T3>Congress did not intend to infringe on valid property rights or effecttakings through section 522(e)</T3>.'' (<T3>NWF v. Hodel,</T3> 839 F.2d at 750, emphasis added).In the same opinion, the Court of Appeals characterized an earlier statementby the U.S. Supreme Court as rejecting the ``too-restrictive interpretationof VER'' embodied in the all permits test within the Secretary's 1979 VERdefinition. The Court of Appeals stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">In <T3>Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining andamp; Reclamation Association,</T3>452 U.S. 264, 101 S. Ct. 2352, 69 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981), the [Supreme] Courtfound that the contention that VER applies only to mining operations forwhich all permits were issued by the date of enactment was compelled neitherby the statute nor its legislative history. (<T3>Id.</T3> at 296 n. 37. 101 S.Ct. at 2370-71 n. 37. <T3>NWF v. Hodel,</T3> 839 F.2d at 750 n. 86.)</ITAG>The Director has analyzed the proposed VER standard in light of the purposesof section 522(e) of SMCRA and the VER exception described above. He recognizesthat in certain situations the Federal rule and the State rule may notbe equivalent. For instance, in a situation involving a non-severed privatelyheld estate (e.g., an inholding in a section 522(e)(1) area or within asection 522(e)(5) buffer zone), VER would likely be denied under the proposedIllinois VER definition even if an operator had applied for all necessarypermits by August 3, 1977. Such a denial would likely occur because reasonableremaining use of the surface would continue to be available where miningwould not be authorized. In this situation, the takings test would be moreenvironmentally protective than the ``good faith all permits'' test.In other circumstances, such as those involving severed mineral estates,the proposed Illinois definition could be more certain than the good faithall permits test to avoid a compensable taking.Considering all of the purposes to be served by section 522(e), the Directorfinds that use of a takings test, as proposed by Illinois, is no less effectivein meeting the requirements of SMCRA than is the ``good faith all permits''test.Finding 2: Needed for and Adjacent TestThe 1979 Federal definition of VER included a needed for and adjacent testallowing a person to claim VER if, as of August 3, 1977, he or she possesseda legally binding conveyance, lease, deed, contract or other document authorizingthe applicant to conduct surface coal mining operations, and he or shecould demonstrate that the coal is both needed for and adjacent to an ongoingsurface coal mining operation for which all approvals and permits wereobtained prior to August 3, 1977. The 1983 definition deleted the firstof these requirements (ownership of rights as of August 3, 1977), althoughas explained in the preamble to that rulemaking (48 FR 41316, September14, 1983), OSMRE did not intend to do so.The preamble notwithstanding, on March 22, 1985, the U.S. District Court,in <T3>In re: Permanent II, </T3>remanded the revised needed for and adjacenttest as promulgated on September 14, 1983, because it expanded the testto include lands for which the applicant had not obtained the requisiteproperty rights as of August 3, 1977, and the Secretary had not providedadequate public notice and opportunity for comment on this expansion. Accordingly,by notice published in the November 20, 1986, <T4>Federal Register </T4>OSMRE suspended the 1983 needed for and adjacenttest and reinstated its 1979 predecessor.The current Illinois proposal, for which the State has provided adequatepublic notice and opportunity to comment, mirrors the language of the 1983Federal needed for and adjacent test. The Director, with the reservationdiscussed below, finds that the Illinois proposal can be approved. In copyingthe language of the 1983 Federal rule, Illinois also reproduced the inadvertenterror discussed in the first paragraph of this finding, i.e., using theneeded for and adjacent test, the definition grants VER to applicants whoobtained the requisite property rights after August 3, 1977. As explainedin the preamble to the 1983 Federal rule (48 FR 41316, September 14, 1983)persons possess VER in such cases only if the prohibition of surface miningwould constitute a taking, which is a different test. Therefore, the Directorfinds that the Illinois needed for and adjacent test is, in this respect,less effective than the corresponding Federal rule and less stringent thanSMCRA in protecting the areas listed in section 522(e) from surface mining.Finding 3: Remainder of DefinitionThe remainder of the definition of VER proposed by Illinois is substantivelyidentical to those portions of the September 14, 1983, Federal definitionof VER not remanded in <T3>In re: Permanent II. </T3>Therefore, the Director finds that, exceptfor the expanded needed for and adjacent test discussed in the previousfinding, the revised Illinois VER definition is no less effective thanthe corresponding Federal definition in 30 CFR 761.5.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Disposition of Comments</ITAG>As required under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4) and (11), the Director solicitedthe views of the State Historic Preservation Officer and all Federal agencieswith an actual or potential interest in the proposed amendment. None electedto comment on the proposed VER definition. Also, as described in the section of this notice entitled ``Submissionand Review of Amendment,'' OSMRE thrice solicited public comment on theproposed amendment. Comments received from the public in response to theMay 9, 1986, and June 26, 1987, solicitations are duplicative of thosereceived in response to the most recent solicitation (October 25, 1988).Therefore, this notice will address only the comments received in responseto the last notice. A summary of the comments received and the Director's disposition of themappears below:1. <T3>Comment: </T3>Old Ben Coal Company states that OSMRE cannot lawfullyreview the efficacy of or approve the Illinois definition until a new Federaldefinition is promulgated. <T3>Response: </T3>The Director does not agree. The Federal definitionhas not been remanded in its entirety, and the November 20, 1986, suspensionnotice reinstated the 1979 version of the Federal definition as modifiedby an August 4, 1980, suspension notice (46 FR 51548) to substitute forthose provisions of the 1983 definition remanded by the court. Even inthe absence of a Federal rule, OSMRE would be able to review and approveor disapprove the proposed State VER definition, using SMCRA alone as astandard. 2. <T3>Comment: </T3>The Illinois South Project, Inc. (ISP) states that theU.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit clearly held in <T3>ISP v. Hodel </T3>that the 1979 definition is the only Federal rulein force, and that it must therefore be the standard of review. <T3>Response: </T3>Although the Director has, as noted in the responseto the previous comment, reinstated portions of the modified 1979 definition,he does not fully agree with the commenter's argument since the unsuspendedportions of the 1983 definition remain in effect. Furthermore, in <T3>ISP v. Hodel, </T3>the court stated that ``the 1979 regulation regainedcurrency when the 1983 regulation died, but its prospective significanceis cloudy'' (Mem. op. at 5), thus indicating some uncertainty as to theutility and status of the 1979 definition. In any case, this argument isimmaterial since the Director has used the modified 1979 definition asa standard of comparison and has found that the revised Illinois definitionis no less effective than the 1979 Federal definition, except as notedin Finding 2.3. <T3>Comment: </T3>ISP states that OSMRE itself has previously found thetakings test to be less protective of the environment than the modifiedall permits test. <T3>Response: </T3>The document upon which ISP bases this statement isstill in draft form and may be revised. The statement itself refers tothe aggregate of section 522(e) areas in all the coal-producing Statesand does not specifically address mitigation factors in Illinois, suchas the paucity of coal in section 522(e)(1) areas in Illinois. In any case, the comment is again immaterial, since, as stated in 30 CFR730.5, the standard of review is whether the State definition is no lesseffective than the Federal rule in meeting the requirements of SMCRA. Asdiscussed in the findings, Congress included the VER exception in section522 of SMCRA not to protect the environment, but rather to avoid creatinga situation where property rights would be infringed upon or taken to theextent that compensation would be required under the Constitution. See<T3>NWF v. Hodel, </T3>839 F.2d at 749-750. The courts have, in one instancewhere its application has been challenged, found that the all permits testas applied by OSMRE would constitute a taking and thus the applicant hadVER (<T3>Sunday Creek Coal Co. v. Hodel, </T3>No. C-2-88-0316 (E.D. Ohio), June2, 1988). The takings test may seem at first glance less protective of the environment,but if, as may reasonably be anticipated, VER applicants denied the rightto mine under the modified all permits test successfully challenge thesedeterminations in the courts as unconstitutional takings, the good faithall permits test ultimately would not be more environmentally protectivethan the takings test. In other words, eleven years after passage of SMCRA,there would exist no or little difference between the two tests when appliedin Illinois by the regulatory authority or the courts. For these reasons, the takings test is no less effective than the modifiedall permits test in meeting the requirements of SMCRA.4. <T3>Comment:</T3> ISP argues that, under the 1979 Federal definition, anymining operation starting after August 3, 1977, would be ineligible forVER unless it met the needed for and adjacent test, and that the Illinoisdefinition errs in allowing VER for other operations beginning after thatdate.<T3>Response:</T3> The Director does not agree that the Illinois definitionis in error. As stated in his response to the preceding comment, the properstandard of review is not whether the definition is more or less protectiveof the environment, but rather whether it is no less effective than theFederal rule in avoiding both takings and the disturbance of protectedareas. The needed for and adjacent test for existing mines was only oneelement of the analysis required under the 1979 VER rule. The preambleto the 1979 rule made clear that, where a VER applicant lacked all necessarypermits, a case-by-case analysis must be made in such a way as to avoida taking. If the applicant had all necessary permits, then that persondefinitely had VER. ISP misreads the 1979 definition and preamble. If aperson had VER on the date of enactment under the case-by-case analysis,that entitlement to VER did not depend on the starting date of the miningoperation. Furthermore, the courts, in <T3>In re: Permanent II,</T3> have affirmed the concept of continuallycreated VER. The Director also notes that, contrary to the ISP comment,a mining operation must have been in existence on August 3, 1977, to claimVER under the 1979 Federal needed for an adjacent test.5. <T3>Comment:</T3> ISP states that Illinois has advanced in compelling argumentson support of its contention that the State definition is no less effectivethan the Federal rule.<T3>Response:</T3> For the reasons cited in the findings and the responsesto previous comments, the Director believes the State definition is noless effective than the Federal definition, except as noted in Finding2. Whether the State has advanced the proper arguments is immaterial.6. <T3>Comment:</T3> ISP took issue with OSMRE's reopening of the commentperiod and asserted that the State advanced no new arguments at the October17, 1988, meeting between Illinois, OSMRE, and Department of the Interiorofficials.<T3>Response:</T3> OSMRE decided to reopen the comment period in the interestof fairness and as appropriate pursuant to the Department's policy on Statecontacts prior to a decision on the State program. See 44 FR 54444, September19, 1979. Moreover, at the October 17 meeting, Illinois argued that approvedof its VER definition would be consistent with the 1988 decision of theSeventh Circuit.Clearly ISP would have objected if it did not have the opportunity to respondto the State's contentions.7. <T3>Comment:</T3> ISP and the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) arguethat it is inappropriate and, in some State, illegal for State agency personnelto make deteminations of property rights and constitutional law which shouldbe reserved for the courts.<T3>Response:</T3> The Director does not agree with the comment as it appliesto Illinois. Because the Illinois proposal has undergone State legal review,the Director has no reason to believe that it would grant agency personnelauthority in excess of that provided under State law. Furthermore, it wouldbe equally inappropriate and irresponsible for agency personnel to ignoreprior case law when making VER determinations. Thus, under the Illinoisrule, State personnel are not precluded from taking administrative actions;however, persons adversely affected by VER decisions may appeal to thecourts. In approving this definition, the Director expects that Illinoiswill exercise its authority in a responsible manner to avoid surface miningin protected areas, as intended by section 522(e) of SMCRA. The Directorrecognizes that Illinois has chosen to define VER in a manner the commentersfind inappropriate on the national level for various policy, implementationand State-specific reasons. However, the Illinois choice must be reviewedunder the ``no less effective than'' standard, with proper emphasis accordedto Illinois law circumstances.8. <T3>Comment:</T3> NWF incorporates by reference its brief in Round IIIof <T3>In re: Permanent II</T3> stating that a full reiteration of its argumentsopposing the takings tests is unnecessary. It then summarizes these argumentsin opposing the Illinois amendment.<T3>Response:</T3> The Director notes that the Secretary has previouslyresponded to the NWF brief filed in the <T3>In re: Permanent II</T3> litigation and, to the extent necessary, incorporatesby reference his earlier response to it and the preamble to the 1983 definition(48 FR 41316, September 14, 1983). Set forth below are his responses toNWF's specific comments on the proposed amendment.9. <T3>Comment:</T3> NWF argues that the takings test is inconsistent withthe intent of Congress in that it creates in incentive for the regulatoryauthority to routinely find that a taking would occur and thus avoid litigationand compensatory awards.<T3>Response:</T3> The Director acknowledges that allowing use of the takingstest could result in its misapplication as described by the commenter.However, the Director must assume that Illinois will properly apply itsVER definition. He does not agree that the theoretical possibility posedby NWF constitutes a basis for disapproval of the amendment. The Illinoisdefinition is no less effective than the Federal definition.Illinois has historically administered its program in a responsible mannerand the Director has no reason to believe that it will act otherwise uponapproval of this amendment. As part of his oversight duties, the Directorwill monitor the State's implementation of this definition, respond tospecific citizen complaints and determine whether the regulatory authority'sdecisions are arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion. See 52 FR26728, July 14, 1988. Moreover, persons adversely affected by an IllinoisVER decision may appeal that decision if the person thinks the decisionwas made improperly. As to compensatory awards, Judge Flannery in 1980 declined to address theconstitutionality of the Secretary's definition. (<T3>In re: Permanent I</T3>, slip op. at 19-20, February 26, 1980). However,any definition of VER that would result in an unconstitutional taking wouldbe improper. Applying a definition without taking into account the particularcircumstances of each permit applicant on a site-specific basis would alsobe improper. See 44 FR 14993, supra.  10. <T3>Comment:</T3> NWF states that OSMRE cannot consider the takings testto be no less effective than the good faith all permits test because thetakings test broadens the scope of the exemption from the limitations andprohibitions of section 522(e) of SMCRA and has been found by the U.S.District Court for the District of Columbia to be a significant departurefrom the definitions proposed in 1982. <T3>Response:</T3> For the reasons stated in Finding 1 and in his responseto Comment No. 3, and because the court ruled solely on procedural grounds,the Director does not find this argument to be valid. 11. <T3>Comment:</T3> NWF states that consideration of the takings test wouldrequire a new environmental impact statement (EIS) and regulatory impactanalysis (RIA) for the Federal VER definition. <T3>Response:</T3> Section 702(d) of SMCRA exempts actions related to Stateprogram approval from those provisions of the National Environmental PolicyAct which would require preparation of an environmental assessment or impactstatement. Similarly, for those actions relating to State program approval,the Office of Management and Budget, on July 12, 1984, granted OSMRE anexemption from those portions of Executive Order 12291 which would requirepreparation of a regulatory impact analysis. States are free to adopt provisionsother than those embodied in the Federal regulations as long as those provisionsare no less effective than the Federal rules and no less stringent thanSMCRA. Since, in this case, the Federal rule itself remains unchanged,OSMRE is not required to complete a new EIS or RIA prior to approving suchState provisions. 12. <T3>Comment:</T3> The Illinois Department of Mines and Minerals (IDMM)argues that the reinstatement of the 1979 good faith all permits and neededfor and adjacent tests in the November 20, 1986, <T4>Federal Register</T4> is itself an improper promulgation and that theonly extant portions of the Federal VER definition_and thus the only portionswhich may be used when evaluating proposed State program amendments_arethose not remanded in <T3>In re: Permanent II. </T3><T3>Response:</T3> These arguments are untimely and therefore irrelevantsince the suspension and reinstatement notice has been published, the timeallowed for appeal has expired, and the reinstatement has taken effect.Furthermore, in <T3>ISP v. Hodel,</T3> the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuitdeclared that, with respect to matters concerning the remanded portionsof the 1983 Federal definition, ``the Secretary would have to use the 1979rule as the basis of any current substantive decision.'' Therefore, thesearguments no longer retain currency. 13. <T3>Comment:</T3> IDMM argues that its revised needed for and adjacenttest more accurately defines when coal in an area adjacent to an ongoingsurface coal mining operation in existence on August 3, 1977, is neededfor the continued operation of the mine, and that it therefore more fullyimplements section 522(e) of SMCRA. <T3>Response:</T3> As discussed in Finding 2, the Director has determinedthat the expanded ``needed for and adjacent'' test included in the Illinoisdefinition is no less effective than the corresponding provisions of the1979 Federal regulation as reinstated on November 20, 1986, except to theextent that this test would apply to property rights acquired after August3, 1977. The Director believes that acquisition of such rights after August3, 1977, does not qualify as an automatic presumption of valid existingrights nor does the 1979 rule so allow. If the coal was indeed criticalto the economic viability of the existing operation, the operator wouldhave acquired the right to mine it prior to initiating the existing operation.Thus, under section 522(e) of SMCRA, mining of such adjacent areas wouldbe permitted only if its prohibition would constitute an unconstitutionaltaking of property rights, which is a different test. Illinois' commentsindicate that it intends to limit the applicability of the needed for andadjacent test in the manner prescribed by the 1979 Federal rule; however,the definition as actually proposed contains no such restriction and itslanguage admits of no such interpretation.Illinois also states that its needed for and adjacent test is clearly noless effective than the good faith all permits test in meeting the requirementsof SMCRA. The Director believes that this is an improper comparison sincethe State test should be compared to the corresponding Federal test, inthis case the needed for and adjacent test. However, for the reasons discussedin the preceding paragraph, he finds that even if this comparison weremade, the Illinois statement is in error. 14. <T3>Comment: </T3>IDMM states that, since the 1983 Federal definition wasremanded on procedural rather than substantive grounds, OSMRE has the authorityand obligation to approve a substantively identical State definition if,as in the case of Illinois, the State has complied with all State requirementsconcerning notice and comment for rulemaking actions. <T3>Response: </T3>Although this argument was not specifically addressedin <T3>ISP v. Hodel, </T3>the Director believes it has no currency in theinstant proceeding since the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuitruled that the Secretary's approval of the Illinois proposal under thedefective 1983 regulation could not stand even though it had been properlypromulgated by the State. The court ordered the Illinois regulation remandedfor further proceedings under whatever Federal regulation is in force atthe time of the decision (<T3>ISP v. Hodel</T3>, Mem. op. at 6). Therefore, although the Directoris, for the most part, approving the Illinois proposal, he is doing soon the grounds ordered by the court, not on the original rationale submittedby the State. 15. <T3>Comment: </T3>IDMM states that the only possible way to fully carryout the Congressional intent to avoid all takings is to equate VER witha taking. IDMM further argues that no mechanical formula will ever perfectlydefine all circumstances in which the prohibition of mining would constitutea taking, and that the good faith all permits test functions ``as a crudesieve to generate a facile VER decision,'' is ``under exclusive,'' andis ``impermissibly vague.'' IDMM also states that approval of the Illinoisamendment using the modified 1979 Federal definition would be consistentwith the Seventh Circuit decision in <T3>ISP v. Hodel, supra</T3>. <T3>Response: </T3>The Director does not agree that the only way to carryout the Congressional intent to avoid all takings is the way chosen byIllinois. He also does not agree that no mechanical test could be devisedthat would be consistent with Congressional intent. In light of the Director'sfindings, it is unnecessary to respond to IDMM's criticisms of the goodfaith all permits test. The Director does agree that approval of the proposedIllinois VER definition is consistent with the Seventh Circuit decision,and for the reasons stated earlier, he is approving the Illinois proposalto include a takings test within its definition of VER. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Director's Decision </ITAG>Based on the above findings, the Director is approving the revised definitionof ``valid existing rights'' in 62 IAC Part 1701, as submitted by Illinoison March 28, 1986, and revised on May 22, 1987, with the exception of theprovision discussed in Finding 2. As explained in that finding, the Directoris disapproving the revised ``needed for and adjacent'' test to the extentthat it would grant valid existing rights claims for lands for which theapplicant obtained the requisite property rights after August 3, 1988.He is also requiring that Illinois amend this definition to limit its applicabilityin accordance with this finding. As provided by 30 CFR 732.17 (a) and (g),any provisions that are not approved by the Director may not be implementedas part of the Illinois program. The Federal rules at 30 CFR Part 913 are being amended to implement thisdecision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expeditethe State program amendment process and to encourage States to conformtheir programs to Federal standards without undue delay. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Procedural Requirements</ITAG>Compliance with the National Environmental Policy ActThe Secretary has determined that, pursuant to section 702(d) of SMCRA,30 U.S.C. 1292(d), no environmental impact statement need be prepared onthis rulemaking. Executive Order No. 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility ActOn July 12, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted OSMREan exemption from sections 3, 4, 7 and 8 of Executive Order 12291 for actionsdirectly related to approval or conditional approval of State regulatoryprograms. Therefore, this action is exempt from preparation of a regulatoryimpact analysis and regulatory review by OMB. The Department of the Interior has determined that, for purposes of theRegulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), this rule will not have a significant economic effecton a substantial number of small entities. This rule will not impose anynew requirements; rather, it will ensure that existing requirements establishedby SMCRA and the Federal rules will be met by the State. Paperwork Reduction ActThis rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 30 CFR Part 913</ITAG>Coal mining, Intergovernmental relations, Surface mining, Underground mining.<ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
