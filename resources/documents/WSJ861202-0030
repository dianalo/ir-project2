Garcia</HL><DD> 12/02/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices ended slightly lower after a late buying spree wiped out just about all of yesterday's early losses.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which showed a loss of nearly 20 points at 3 p.m. EST, finished the day down 1.69 at 1912.54. Much of the late buying was tied to arbitrage against stock-index futures. Even General Motors, which announced a buyout of its Electronic Data Systems head, H. Ross Perot, took part in the late rebound. Down nearly 3 at midday, it closed down 1 3/8 at 71 1/2 on volume of 2.1 million shares. But it was by far the worst performer among the 30 issues in the industrial average.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index closed down 0.17 at 249.05, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.18 to 142.39.    Although these closely followed market barometers recovered smartly in the final hour of trading, the rebound was still narrow. At the close, losers had a 9-6 lead over gainers on the Big Board. Volume rose to 133.8 million shares from 93.5 million Friday.    Many traders were surprised by the late turnaround. Noting that the surge involved a relatively small group of stocks, Larry Wachtel, a market strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities, said that indicated much of the advance had been driven by index arbitrage activities.    Futures traders also cited such activities as the main force in the rebound. But others preferred to take a more optimistic view.    &quot;I feel very constructive about the way the market closed,&quot; said Martin Krouner, a vice president at Jefferies andamp; Co. in New York. He said the market had staged a &quot;stunning reversal&quot; that may have compelled some investors to buy stocks to cover short positions as well as influenced some sidelined institutional investors to become buyers.    The start of trading gave no hint of what was to come. The Dow Jones industrials fell more than 22 points in the first 30 minutes, with traders blaming a weak bond market.    The bond market had focused on a decline in the dollar that reflected growing concern among U.S. allies over the controversy over U.S. arms sales to Iran. Bond market watchers feared that the Federal Reserve would be reluctant to lower interest rates anytime soon if the dollar was weakening.    However, by midafternoon both the bond market and the dollar had recovered. Futures traders in Chicago then rapidly bid up the price of the December stock-index futures contract on the Sandamp;P 500-stock index. The advance in the futures contract widened the spread between the contract and the underlying index. This wider spread gave rise to the late buy programs, as it became worthwhile for arbitragers to sell the contract and buy the actual stocks that make up the index.    The late rebound helped many blue-chip issues regain most of the ground they lost in early trading, and some closed higher on the day.    International Business Machines, which traded as low as 125 1/4 early yesterday, closed up 1/4 at 127 3/8. General Electric rose 1/2 to 83 1/2; Philip Morris eased 3/8 to 73 7/8; Eastman Kodak fell 3/8 to 67 1/2; and Merck gained 1/4 to 110 3/4.    At General Motors, Mr. Perot resigned as a director and as head of Electronic Data Systems, and the company bought back the GM shares held by Mr. Perot. GM valued the buyback at $750 million -- $400 million for the stock and the rest for &quot;contingency fees&quot; agreed to by GM when it acquired EDS. GM is setting up a new unit to manage its electronic and defense operations.    GM's Class E stock, issued in its acquisition of EDS, plunged 4 1/2 to 26 7/8 on more than 1.5 million shares. Its Class H stock, issued in the auto maker's acquisition of Hughes Aircraft, fell 1 3/4 to 39 1/8.    Chesebrough-pond's was the most active issue on the big board, with more than 8.4 million shares changing hands. The stock rose 3 to 68 1/2. American Brands decided to go ahead with its planned $2.8 billion tender offer at $66 a share. Talks with Chesebrough had collapsed although American Brands was prepared to raise its bid to $69 a share. American brands inched up 1/8 to 45. After the market closed, Unilever N.V. launched a $72.50-a-share, or $3.1 billion, bid for Chesebrough.    Viacom International rose 2 1/4 to 41 3/8 in active trading. The company filed a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission on its previously announced leveraged buyout plan, indicating the buyout was proceeding as planned. In the wake of the widening insider-trading scandal on Wall Street, there had been concern that this and other transactions might not be completed if investor groups had financing difficulties.    The late recovery was sharper for semiconductor stocks than for many other issues. Texas Instruments sprinted ahead 5 to 124 1/2; Motorola rose 1 7/8 to 39 7/8; Advanced Micro Devices gained 1 1/8 to 16 3/4; National Semiconductor added 5/8 to 12; and Intel advanced 1/2 to 23 1/2 in over-the-counter trading.    Larry Borgman, an analyst with Nomura Securities, said these stocks were reacting to news that Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry asked semiconductor manufacturers not to sell their products at excessively low prices in such markets such as Europe and Southeast Asia. He said investors probably saw the news as a chance for U.S. semiconductor companies to become more competitive in world markets.    Resorts International Class B rose 6 1/2 to 125 1/2 on the American Stock Exchange. Pratt Hotels, which twice has been rebuffed in its bid to buy voting control of Resorts, plans to launch a $135-a-share tender offer for all the Class B common. Pratt ended unchanged at 3 7/8 in the OTC market.    Carter Hawley Hale rose 1 3/8 to 54 1/4. Limited and Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. said they would proceed with their planned tender offer at $55 a share even without the support of a major shareholder, General Cinema, which has a 38.6% stake in Carter Hawley via convertible preferred. Limited was unchanged at 32 1/2, and General Cinema eased 1/4 to 48 1/4.    Angiomedics rose 3 3/4 to 12 3/4 in OTC trading. The company agreed to be acquired by Pfizer for $13.25 a share. Pfizer fell 3/8 to 60 5/8.    Syscon reopened and rose 3 1/4 to 19 in OTC trading on news that a friendly $19.50-a-share tender offer from Harnischfeger Industries had commenced. The offer was launched Friday, after trading in the stock was halted.    Borden dropped 2 1/8 to 49 7/8. Drexel Burnham Lambert reportedly took the stock off its recommended list.    In the OTC market, the Nasdaq composite index fell 1.70 to 357.87 as volume rose to 97.8 million shares from 61.9 million Friday. There were 1,366 issues declining and 771 advancing. </TEXT></DOC>
