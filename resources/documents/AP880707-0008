DALY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who has been highlycritical of the Reagan adminsitration's deficit spending in hisDemocratic presidential campaign, has a deficit problem of his own.   Two weeks before his certain selection as the Democraticpresidential nominee, the Massachusetts governor faces a $450million deficit on an $11 billion budget in the just-ended fiscalyear and has yet to sign a budget for the new one.   And according to a new poll, the Massachusetts governor'sfavorability rating is declining _ although residents of his homestate still heavily favor him over Republican George Bush.   Dukakis aides insist that the budget problems will be resolvedin short order and that the governor's home-state popularity willrebound.   But the Bush campaign is already making the fiscal woes into acampaign issue.   ``It could turn out to be the Achilles heel of the Dukakispresidential campaign,'' said state Sen. Paul Cellucci, aMassachusetts coordinator for the Bush campaign.   The state government's new fiscal year began last Friday, andDukakis has yet to close a $450 million deficit for last year andstill must shepherd a 1989 budget to his desk. Faced with anunexpected revenue shortfall, the governor is scaling back hisspending plans and pushing for a package of narrowly targeted taxand fee increases.   On Wednesday, Dukakis was forced to ask the Legislature for $81million in emergency spending authority to avoid having to renegeon the state payroll and welfare checks. The House approved themeasure.   ``The putting together of budgets is not a pleasant process towatch _ never has been, never will be,'' said John DeVillars, thegovernor's deputy chief secretary. ``There is obviously a greatdeal more attention to the process this year, in part because ofunanticipated events that have led to less revenue than expectedand in part because the chief executive is running for nationaloffice.''   According to a telephone survey last week of 400 likelyMassachusetts voters, 56 percent said Dukakis has not been aneffective governor while campaigning for president and 47 percentsaid he should resign now or immediately after the Democraticconvention July 18-21.   In addition, the governor's unfavorable rating has more thandoubled _ to 36 percent _ since a similar poll in January 1987,before Dukakis declared his intention to run. His favorable ratingdropped from 71 percent to 55 percent.   Still, the survey said Dukakis was favored over Bush, 51 percentto 37 percent. The poll was conducted for WBZ-TV and The BostonHerald by KRC Communications.   DeVillars said Dukakis has devoted well over 100 hours in recentweeks to the state's budget problems while at the same timefocusing on the selection of a vice presidential running mate. Buthe has not dominated the budget process as he has in past years.   Based on June tax collections, the government is technicallyabout $450 million in deficit for fiscal 1988, according tolegislative leaders. Dukakis has offered a 20-point program toclose that gap through bookkeeping changes and borrowing, but thestate House has balked at several unpopular features.   Dukakis and his legislative allies argue that the deficit wasthe unforseeable result of a downturn in income tax receiptscombined with $92 million in court-ordered corporate tax abatements.   At the same time, Dukakis has been forced to retreat from the$12 billion spending goal for fiscal 1989 that he announced inJanuary, and he has agreed with top Democratic lawmakers to reducethe spending target.   A conference committee negotiated a compromise late Wednesday of$11.75 billion, which Dukakis is expected to sign next week.   A principal sticking point has been nervousness about revenuesfor the coming year. After five years of double-digit revenuegrowth, tax collections fell nearly flat last year. Nevertheless,the administration projects a comeback in fiscal 1989 of 12percent, a figure that many legislators question.   In order to buttress revenues, Dukakis has turned to taxes. Herecently signed a $40 million tax on cigarettes, and more than $200million in other new taxes are moving toward his desk.   One would raise personal taxes on the wealthy by bringing thestate code back into conformance with federal law, another wouldend a corporate loophole that allows multistate companies to writeoff their out-of-state losses, and a third would capture some $24million a year in unclaimed bottle deposits that now stay in thehands of bottlers.   Cellucci blames Dukakis for over-spending during his second term.   ``You can't have budgets that rise at twice the rate ofinflation and add 10,000 new state employees and not have a day ofreckoning. This is the day of reckoning that they're trying topostpone until after November.''</TEXT></DOC>
