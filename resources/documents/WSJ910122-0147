The chemical company, 83%-owned by Atlantic Richfield Co.,Los Angeles, said that although certain operations resumed atthe plant in September and November, the plant's propyleneoxide/styrene unit is just beginning the process ofrestarting, several weeks later than anticipated. Anexplosion at the plant in July killed 17 workers. Roughly 35%of the company's capacity is produced there.</LP><TEXT>   Earnings declined to $68 million, or 71 cents a share,from $75 million, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier.Revenue rose 25% to $759 million from $606 million, helped byhigher gasoline prices. Arco Chemical's methyl tertiary butylether is used as an octane enhancer in gasoline.   The company said margin gains for the quarter and year forpropylene oxide, used to make foam for seating, and methyltertiary butyl ether were offset by reduced volumes forstyrene monomer and propylene oxide and lower styrene marginsbecause of the Channelview plant closing. Styrene monomer isused in making plastic cups.   In the year, net fell 13% to $351 million, or $3.66 ashare, from $405 million, or $4.22 a share, a year earlier.That included a $43 million favorable adjustment resultingfrom the adoption of Financial Accounting Standard No. 96.Revenue rose 6.2% to $2.83 billion from $2.66 billion.   Alan R. Hirsig, president and chief executive, said the1990 gross profit margin of $821 million, including a $120million business interruption insurance claim related to theChannelview incident, &quot;is essentially equal&quot; to 1989 results.   Arco Chemical said pretax earnings for 1990 were affectedby about $90 million of charges arising from the Channelviewincident. The charges consist primarily of costs relating tosettlement of litigation, net of insurance recovery, asettlement with the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration, and the value of assets destroyed.   Arco recently agreed to pay a record $3.5 million fine tosettle OSHA charges of workplace violations at the plant. Thepayment didn't constitute an admission it violated any OSHArules.</TEXT></DOC>
