The Liberal Democratic Party has governed Japan since itsformation in 1955, but party leaders say it has been brought to anunprecedented crisis by sex and money scandals and unpopularpolicies.   Sunday's elections for half the seats in the 252-member upperhouse of Parliament could begin an erosion of power that eventuallywill make the revolutionary thought an inevitable reality.   Sixty-six Liberal Democratic members are ending their six-yearterms and the party must retain 54 of those seats to keep control.Analysts and poll takers don't expect it to happen.   ``We are very confident the LDP will lose its majority,'' saidTakashi Yonezawa, secretary-general of the Democratic SocialistParty.   Yonezawa's party, the fourth-largest opposition group inParliament, has been negotiating with the leading oppositionSocialists, the Buddhist-supported Komeito (Clean Government) Partyand the Social Democratic Federation about a possible coalitiongovernment if the conservative Liberal Democrats lose their mandate.   Elections for the lower house, where the real power lies, neednot be held until next year, but a Liberal Democratic loss onSunday could create pressure for an earlier vote. The governingparty has 243 of the 512 seats in the lower house and allianceswith smaller conservative parties give it a majority.   The four opposition parties talking coalition have 78 seats inthe upper house, compared with 142 for the Liberal Democrats, andmust win 49 more on Sunday to gain control.   A coalition would not be easy because they have majordifferences on what changes to make in the policies of thepro-business, pro-Western Liberal Democrats.   At a news conference Friday, Yonezawa said Socialist policieswere ``unrealistic,'' and indicated the possibility of an alliancewith the Liberal Democrats.   Both Yonezawa's party, which is more conservative than its nameindicates, and the Liberal Democrats say the Socialists wouldcancel the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. The Socialists say theywould seek revisions.   ``The DSP holds a balancing ticket, and, depending on theoutcome of the election, could play a pivotal role in Japan'spolitics,'' the party leader said.   Shizuo Sato, a first-term Liberal Democrat in the lower house,expressed the view gaining currency in the governing party:   ``If the people's decision goes against the LDP ... instead offorming a coalition of our own, it might be better to turn thegovernment over to an opposition coalition.''   ``I'm sure they'll fail and hurt the economy,'' he said in aninterview. ``Then the people will realize the value of our party.We would also have time in the interim to regroup and resolve someof our internal problems.''   Sato said he does not advocate simply handing over power, but itmight have a beneficial effect ``if we have no choice because ofthe way people vote. We are doing our best to see that they staywith us.''   After a major loss in Tokyo elections this month, Trade andIndustry Minister Seiroku Kajiyama said: ``Speaking as a lawmakerand not a Cabinet member, I think it might be good for the party toturn the administration over to the opposition once. That wouldgive us time to regroup.''   An aide said later that Kajiyama's remarks applied to the Tokyocity government, not national politics, but added: ``This might bedifferent if there are big losses in the upper house.''   Several other Cabinet ministers have expressed similar viewsprivately, said political analyst Asao Yamaguchi, ``but they say soon the condition of big losses later, in the lower house.''   Support for the Liberal Democrats has dwindled because of a 3percent sales tax imposed April 1, an influence-buying scandal thatcaused Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita to resign and allegationsthat his successor, Sousuke Uno, kept several paid mistresses.   Farmers, traditionally a reliable source of for the governingparty, have been alienated by its moves to open Japan toagricultural imports.   A poll published Friday by the newspaper Asahi said 28 percentof those surveyed said they planned to vote Socialist, comparedwith 21 percent for the Liberal Democrats, and 40 percent wereundecided. The nationwide poll of 2,410 people was taken July 9-10.   Before elections three years ago, the Asahi poll put LiberalDemocrat support at 46 percent and the Socialists at 11 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
