Delta Air Lines fired the opening salvo early this week,offering free flights or first-class upgrades to anybody whocompletes eight ``segments'' of travel.   A segment generally means any separate flight or connectingflight that costs more than a minimum amount.   Late Thursday, American Airlines and United Airlines announcedtheir own programs offering free flights, to be taken later nextyear, for anybody who racks up either eight segments of flight orthree round trips.   American acknowledged its offer was in response to Delta, andUnited acknowledged it was responding to the other two.   Northwest's program also requires three roundtrips or eightsegments, spokeswoman Christy Clapp said this morning.   Airlines typically rush to match cheap fares and promotionsoffered by their competitors for fear they could otherwise losepassengers.   Analysts have said the latest deal seems to be getting a headstart on promotions that generally come out after the winterholiday season, as the sluggish months of January and February setin.   They said the airlines need to avoid offering broad deals thatare too good for passengers or run the risk of compounding troublesbrought on by high fuel prices and sluggish demand for air travel.</TEXT></DOC>
