The energetic /sup 3/He ion 'tail' was measureddirectly with a charge exchange neutral analyser for the first time.Comparisons with bounce averaged quasi-linear calculations suggest amodestly peaked radiofrequency power deposition profile. The double chargeexchange process /sup 3/He/sup ++/+/sup 4/He/sup o/-andgt;/sup 3/He/sup o/+/sup4/He/sup ++/ demonstrated in these measurements may be useful as partof an alpha particle diagnostic in a fusion reactor experiment.
