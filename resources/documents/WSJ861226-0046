The Fed's decision widens a crack in the half-century-old legal wall separating commercial banking and securities activities. It came just one day after a federal appeals court upheld the Fed's earlier approval of the commercial paper activities of Bankers Trust New York's banking unit, Bankers Trust Co.    The Fed also agreed to hold a public hearing in early February on applications by Bankers Trust, Citicorp and J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. to underwrite commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities, municipal revenue bonds and consumer-related receivables through subsidiaries that underwrite U.S. government securities. The Fed hopes to decide the matter by the end of April.    Only once before in the Fed's history has its board of governors taken testimony in a public hearing.    Under the Fed's latest decision, issued Wednesday, BT Commercial Corp. of Chicago, a wholly owned subsidiary of B.T. Leasing Services Inc. of New York, another Bankers Trust New York unit, could assume the commercial paper placement activities now conducted by Bankers Trust.    BT Commercial, like Bankers Trust, would act as an adviser and agent to issuers of commercial paper, but it wouldn't have an independent financial stake in the issues it places, as investment bankers do.    The Fed, using reasoning that closely followed that of the U.S. Court of Appeals three-judge panel in its Tuesday decision, said that placement of commercial paper by bank holding company subsidiaries doesn't constitute &quot;underwriting&quot; under the Glass-Steagall Act, which generally separates banking and securities activities, &quot;because there would be no public offering of commercial paper.&quot;    Moreover, the Fed said that even if such commercial paper activity were covered by the Glass-Steagall Act, banks wouldn't be considered to be violating the law, which prohibits them from being &quot;engaged principally&quot; in underwriting securities, so long as they follow certain guidelines.    The guidelines, spelled out in the Fed's decision, are designed to ensure that the securities activities are &quot;only an insubstantial line of activity.&quot; Specifically, the Fed directed that BT Commercial's gross revenue from its commercial paper activities can't exceed 5% of its total gross revenue, and that its share of the total dealer-placed commercial paper market can't exceed 5%.    The Fed based that limitation, in part, on the definition of &quot;principal&quot; in the 1933 edition of Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language -- &quot;the version available at the time the Glass-Steagall Act was enacted,&quot; the decision notes.    The Fed accompanied the ruling with a strongly worded plea, buttressed by a separate statement by Chairman Paul Volcker, that Congress reconsider the 53-year-old Glass-Steagall Act's ban on banks' engaging in investment banking activities.    &quot;The public interest . . . will not, however, be optimally served by attempting to fit today's markedly different financial markets into the 50-year-old Glass-Steagall Procrustean bed,&quot; declared the Fed board's statement.    Wrote Mr. Volcker: &quot;Legislation should be adopted promptly to give straightforward authority for bank holding companies to engage in certain underwriting activities.&quot;    In New York, Bankers Trust said the Fed's decision, coupled with Tuesday's appeals court ruling, gives it &quot;considerable flexibility&quot; in managing its commercial paper business. But it added that it hasn't yet decided whether to operate the business in the bank or in a separate subsidiary.    Industry sources said Bankers Trust sought permission from the Fed to operate the business in a separate unit after the Securities Industry Association challenged the Fed's earlier approval of Bankers Trust Co.'s commercial paper activities. These sources indicated that Bankers Trust would probably move its commercial paper operations to the subsidiary if the Fed approved the other pending securities-related applications.    As for the Fed's decision to conduct hearings early next year, Bankers Trust said, &quot;We're confident that this further inquiry will make the case for approval of our application all the clearer.&quot;    Reaction of other banks with a stake in the Fed's action was mixed.    Citicorp said, &quot;The issue of bank holding companies' securities and underwriting powers moves ahead significantly with this ruling and the appeals court finding in Washington Tuesday. We are particularly heartened by the Fed's confirming the view of the bank applicants that securities activities not permissible for banks themselves are permissible for their affiliates.&quot;    But Lewis T. Preston, chairman of J.P. Morgan, said the company is &quot;gravely disappointed&quot; that the Fed hasn't yet decided on the company's application after 16 months of study. He said that while Morgan hasn't yet reviewed the Fed opinion, &quot;the position taken is likely to accelerate our analysis of alternative courses of action.&quot;    A Morgan spokesman declined to specify what those alternatives might be. But Morgan, Bankers Trust, and Chase Manhattan Corp. have said at various times that they'd consider dropping their banking charters if legal barriers restricting their investment banking activities aren't eliminated. In response to questions from this newspaper, Morgan, however, has said in the past that such a move wasn't likely.    A spokesman for the Securities Industry Association said, &quot;Obviously we're disappointed in the Fed's decision and we'll play an active role in the hearings.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
