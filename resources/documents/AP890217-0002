President Bush says he's wary of the promises NicaraguanPresident Daniel Ortega made to hold a free and fair electionbecause he believes the Sandinista leader has been unfaithful in thepast after making similar pledges.   But the four other leaders _ all friendly to the United States _who assembled with Ortega at a beachside resort in El Salvadorbelieved Ortega's promises were heartfelt enough to give him thebenefit of the doubt.   The result was unanimous agreement on a lengthy communiquedesigned to lay the groundwork for two objectives all sides say theywant: peace and democracy in Nicaragua.   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., felt Ortega's stated commitment inthe communique to democracy was so convincing that the NicaraguanContras should declare victory.   ``I think this is what the Contra forces in essence have beenasking,'' said Bonior, long a Contra antagonist. ``I think itpresents a unique opportunity for them to take advantage.''   But Bush was more skeptical. ``What's troubling me is that ...claims like this have been made at one time, only to see thoseclaims repudiated,'' Bush said Thursday.   In return for his promises of democratic reform, Ortega got hiscolleagues from Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala toagree to draw up a plan within 90 days that will lead to thedemobilization of the Contras.   That has been Ortega's highest priority for years. A year ago,the U.S. Congress granted his wish to suspend military aid to therebels; now, his neighbors are agreeing to their demobilization.   Meanwhile, the United States has been playing the unaccustomedrole of bystander to events in Central America. The Bushadministration has yet to make some key appointments, including someat the State Department, and has been occupied with other issues,leaving a vacuum in Central America which the five countries decidedto fill this week.   The administration's hand in Central America seems to get weakerby the day. Two years ago, some in the administration had high hopesthat the Contras would be able to topple the Sandinistas.   A year ago, the goal was reduced to just getting Congress toapprove humanitarian aid for the rebels. Now, the administrationwants to find a way to head off the planned Contra demobilization,hoping that their continued existence _ if only as a potentialmilitary menace _ will induce Ortega to keep his word.   At a minimum, this has been an interesting week for the Reagandoctrine, the grand design of the former president to assist theContras and anti-communist rebels elsewhere who are fightingpro-Soviet regimes.   The Contras were once the centerpiece of that doctrine but theyare now reduced to what amounts to welfare recipients: huddled inaustere camps in Honduras near the Nicaraguan border, living offU.S.-donated food, facing the specter of demobilization, and prayingthat the political winds in Washington will some day favor themagain.   In contrast to the Contras, the news was somewhat better thisweek for another pet rebel group of Reagan's _ the Afghanresistance. The day after the Central American presidents called forthe demobilization of the Contras, the last Soviet soldier withdrewfrom Afghanistan in a major triumph both for U.S. policy and for theanti-Soviet resistance.   But the Soviet-backed regime is still in power and peace stillseems distant in Afghanistan as the two sides, both heavily-armed bytheir respective superpower patrons, continue their struggle withthe Soviet Army on the sidelines for the first time in nine years.   The United States pressed the Soviets to withdraw for years but,now that the Kremlin has complied, Washington is escalating itsobjectives.   Bush said it would not be fair for the United States to cut offaid to the rebels after the departing Soviet soldiers left behindall those fighter aircraft, helicopters, tanks, howitzers and otherequipment.   So in Afghanistan, the somewhat incongruous Valentine's Weekprospect is for a lot more warmaking than lovemaking.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   George Gedda has covered foreign affairs for theAssociated Press since 1968.</TEXT></DOC>
