Dukakis led among the Democrats with 386 delegates for a totalof 455.5, but Jesse Jackson and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. werehot on the heels of the Massachusetts governor.   Jackson picked up 366 delegates for a total of 393.55 while Gorecollected 326 delegates for a total of 347.8.   The close finish among the three Democrats fueled the theory ofSen. Paul Simon's campaign that Super Tuesday would produce a``gridlock'' of delegates, making it unlikely that any candidatewould gain a majority of the delegates after the last round ofprimaries in June.   Bush, who amassed 578 delegates with wins in 16 primaries, has62 percent of the 1,139 delegates needed to win the GOP nomination_ a total of 705. Kansas Sen. Bob Dole was a distant second,collecting 98 delegates for a total of 163.   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson won 9 delegates for atotal of 17 and New York Rep. Jack Kemp added four delegates to hisprevious total of 35. Thirty-five delegates remain uncommitted.   Simon, who bypassed the Super Tuesday contests to concentrate onthe primary in his home state of Illinois, slated for next week,gained no delegates and stands at his previous total of 35.5.   Rep. Richard Gephardt apparently failed to get his messageacross in the Southern and border states, capturing just 93delegates, including 61 of 77 in his home state of Missouri.Gephardt emerged from Super Tuesday with a total of 143 delegates.   Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart had no delegates, and 259.65 areuncommitted.   In Minnesota, the state Democratic Party released results fromits Feb. 23 precinct caucuses, which had been kept under seal untilSuper Tuesday at the demand of the national party. The results wereso incomplete, however, that a national figure could not becalculated for 78 of Minnesota's delegates.   Going into Super Tuesday, Bush held 127 GOP delegates andDukakis had 69.5 Democratic delegates.   Dole began the day with 65 delegates, Robertson had eight and 12Republican delegates chosen before Tuesday were uncommitted.   Gephardt had 50 Democratic delegates before Tuesday's balloting,Jackson had 27.55, Gore had 21.8, and 254.65 were uncommitted. Inaddition to delegates picked through primaries or caucuses, thosetotals included Democratic ``super delegates,'' the party leaders,governors and others who will automatically hold seats as delegatesto the national convention.   Under Democratic Party rules, some of the ``super delegates''cast fractional votes.   In all, 4,162 delegates are to attend the Democratic NationalConvention in Atlanta in July and 2,277 delegates will attend theRepublican National Convention in New Orleans in August. Winningthe Democratic presidential nomination will require support from atleast 2,082 delegates.</TEXT></DOC>
