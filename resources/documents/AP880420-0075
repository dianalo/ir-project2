Few of the hostages saw the hijackers' faces because the captorsshowed themselves only with their faces covered by pillowcases thathad holes cut out for the eyes.   ``The worst moment was when they put a gun to the head of one ofthe passengers,'' said the plane's purser, Abdel Monem Mahmoud, anEgyptian. ``Their eyes were sharp and expressionless, like those ofa shark.''   One of the hostages said he once caught a glimpse of the facesof five of the hijackers through a crack in a toilet door.   ``They were all very young,'' said the man, whose name was notused for his safety.   He said that from this brief view and from the hijackers' voiceshe might be able to recognize some of them, but he added: ``Allexcept their leader _ I never saw his face and he never spoke tous.''   The hostages said no one among them knew that two Kuwaitis werekilled during the plane's stopover in Cyprus last week. Thehijackers probably used silencers on the guns with which they shottwo Kuwaiti security men aboard the plane.   ``I had no idea they killed anyone,'' said Ali Kandari, 24, anastonished expression on his face. ``Who was it? Where? When?''   None of the hostages reported being tortured or beaten, butKandari said he saw one of the hijackers savagely striking anelderly man who insisted on going to the toilet after they hadordered him to sit down.   The man, a diabetic, was released last Thursday and immediatelyhospitalized.   Hostages said they were handcuffed at all times. Some even readthe Koran, the Moslem holy book, with their hands in cuffs.   They said that on Tuesday night, just hours before theirrelease, the hijackers distributed the traditional fast-breakingRamadan evening meal, then ordered the captives to go to sleepwithout allowing them the usual time for prayer.   A 31-year-old businessman, Tadar El Khebi, said he knew theywere about to be released today when he noticed the hijackers goingthrough the plane shortly after 4 a.m. wiping clean every spotwhere they might have left fingerprints. Two hours later, thehostages walked out of the plane to freedom, trembling and lookingdazed.   Many of the hostages said they were in constant fear for theirlives.   ``From the very begining I thought of death,'' Mahmoud said. ``Ithought I would be the first to be killed because they were verysecurity conscious, and they immediately asked me where I had mygun.   ``My mind kept flashing back to my past,'' he added. ``At suchmoments, you think about things that you never imagined you wouldremember.''   Mahmoud said it was the second hijack of his flying career withKuwait Airways. He said he was in a Kuwaiti Boeing 727 hijacked in1984 when two American passengers were killed.   ``I'm happy I'm still okay,'' he said.   The Iraqi captain of the plane, gray-bearded Subhi Youssef, 53,sat quietly in the airport VIP lounge as reporters milled around.   Clearly a man of few words, his eyes glinted when a reporterasked what he would do after returning to Kuwait.   ``I will sit and think about it,'' he said with a slight smile.   Algerian aviation officials said they were impressed by thequiet and effective professionalism with which Youssef handled theplane and its technical radio communications with the control towerthroughout the ordeal in Algiers.   Youssef, a pilot for 32 years, 20 of them with Kuwaiti Airways,was asked how he felt when the hijackers put a gun to his head inthe cockpit when the plane was seized April 5 on a flight fromBangkok to Kuwait.   ``What can you do?'' Youssef shrugged in reply.   How did he feel now that it was all over?   ``I am really relieved,'' he said, his face showing fatigue.Algerian offials said the plane's crew was too exhausted to fly thejumbo jet back to Kuwait.   Another hostage, 26-year-old lieutenant in the Kuwait fireservice who gave his name only as Ali, said he never lostconfidence that the authorities would find a solution.   He said he fully supported the Kuwait government's refusal tomeet the hijackers' main demand, the release of 17 prisoners inKuwait convicted on terrorism charges.   ``We agree with our government's attitude,'' he said. ``But weknew they would help us. Our government never forgets any Kuwaitcitizen.''</TEXT></DOC>
