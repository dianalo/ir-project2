Michel Aoun told a meeting of bank employees inChristian east Beirut, referring to the 40,000 Syrian soldiersstationed in Lebanon.   He spoke hours after a committee of 17 Lebanese parliamentmembers meeting in Taif, Saudi Arabia, approved a tentative planfor ending the 14-year-old sectarian civil war, which has cost morethan 150,000 lives.   Conference sources said the committee met again in the eveningto prepare for a full session of the 63 deputies, who must approvethe agreement.   The evening session ended abruptly when Christian deputy GeorgeSaadeh, leader of the right-wing Phalange Party, objected to``crippling'' demands and stormed out. He did not elaborate, and noword emerged on when committee meetings would resume.   Committee members would not give provisions of the plan. Beirutradio stations well connected with various factions said itprovided for ``limited and phased'' Syrian withdrawal and curtailedthe powers of the president, traditionally a Christian.   Aoun said in Beirut: ``We want radical reforms of this systemfrom the roots, and not the patching up of a rotten system the waythey are trying to patch it up.'' He did not specifically mentionthe Taif agreement.   ``Either there is reform in a free land where a free peoplelives, or there isn't,'' Aoun said. ``I hope everyone will be awareof this reality and always remember that a war of liberationerupted in Lebanon for this purpose.   ``It will continue until it achieves its goals. A meeting tryingto abort the goals of this war will not stop it. Let those deputiesunderstand that Lebanon's sovereignty and independence are not amatter for bargaining and negotiation.''   Zaher al-Khatib, a Sunni Moslem deputy from the pro-SyrianNational Front alliance, said Aoun ``is the number one enemy of thenation ... trying to affect the course of the conference and abortits mission of salvaging the country and ending the suffering ofits people.''   Syrian troops are in Lebanon under an Arab League peacekeepingmandate issued in 1976, the year after fighting began. Aounconsiders them an occupying force. He vowed to drive them out afteran artillery war began March 8 between his Christian army units anda Moslem alliance led by the Syrians.   At least 930 people were killed and more than 2,000 wounded,nearly all of them civilians, before a cease-fire sponsored by theArab League stopped the shelling Sept. 22.   On Sept. 30, those of the 99 Lebanese parliament members who hadsurvived the long civil war met in Taif to seek a settlement.   After an overnight session, deputies Najah Wakim, an OrthodoxChristian, and Hassan Rifai, a Sunni, said Thursday they wereoptimistic.   Voice of the People, a pro-Syrian radio station, said Christianswould continue to fill the presidency but would have fewer powers.   It said the president no longer would be able to issue generalamnesties, could dissolve the parliament only once in his six-yearterm and would not be supreme military commander. The station saidthe military would rpeort to the Cabinet, traditionally led by aSunni as prime minister.   The reforms are designed to give more power to Moslems, who havebecome the majority since Lebanon gained independence from Francein 1943.   Druse chieftain Walid Jumblatt and Nabih Berri, leader of theShiite Moslem militia Amal, have dismissed the Taif deliberationson grounds the proposals being considered do not give Moslemsenough power. Both are allied with Syria.</TEXT></DOC>
