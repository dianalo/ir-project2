The proposed amendmentsalso would clarify and update disclosure standards that have been developedfor closed-end funds.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The text of amended Form N-2 is Appendix B to this release.(2) Amendments to rules 495, 496, and 497 (17 CFR 230.495, 496, and 497)of Regulation C under the 1933 Act (17 CFR 230.400 <T3>et seq.</T3>) to add Form N-2 to the registration forms specified inthose rules. (3) Amendments to rules 8b-11, 8b-12, and 8b-16 (17 CFR 270.8b-11, 8b-12,and 8b-16) under the 1940 Act. Rules 8b-11 and 8b-12 would be amended toadd Form N-2 to the registration forms specified in those rules. The proposedamendment to rule 8b-16 would exempt closed-end funds from the requirementto annually update their registration statements provided certain disclosuresare made to fund shareholders. (4) Amendments to Form N-14 (17 CFR 239.23), the registration form underthe 1933 Act to register securities issued in certain investment companybusiness combination transactions. The amendments to Form N-l4 would reflectthe three part registration format being proposed for Form N-2. (5) A new rule 134b and amendments to rules 430, 460, 463 and 481 (17 CFR230.430, 460, 463, and 481) of Regulation C under the 1933 Act. The amendmentsto rules 430 and 460 would require that an SAI be available for deliveryto investors at the time that a preliminary prospectus is circulated. Proposedrule 134b would provide a ``safe harbor'' for the use of the SAI priorto the effective date of the registration statement. The amendment to rule481 would specify the appropriate legend to be printed on an SAI used priorto the effective date of the registration statement. The amendment to rule463 would clarify that a closed-end fund that has elected to be regulatedas a business development company (``BDC'') is not required to file a reporton Form SR (17 CFR 239.61) with respect to the use of proceeds from aninitial public offering. The Commission also is publishing staff guidelines for the preparationof amended Form N-2 which are contained in Appendix C to this release.All comments and suggestions received concerning staff guidelines willbe considered by the staff in developing final guidelines. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background and Summary </ITAG>Form N-2 is the registration form used by closed-end funds to registeras investment companies under the 1940 Act and to register their securitiesunder the 1933 Act. Unlike open-end management investment companies (``mutualfunds''), closed-end funds do not issue redeemable securities or continuouslyoffer their shares to the public. Rather, a closed-end fund issues, ina traditional underwritten offering, a fixed number of shares that aresubsequently traded on a securities exchange or in the over-the-countermarket at a price determined by the market, which typically is lower thanthe share's net asset value.\2\<NOTE/> Another distinction between closed-end funds and mutual fundsis that the 1940 Act permits a closed-end fund to issue senior securitiesconsisting of one class of preferred stock and one class of debt.\3\<NOTE/> However, a closed-end fund is much like a mutual fund inthat it offers to investors an opportunity to invest in a professionallymanaged portfolio of securities. Therefore, closed-end funds usually serveas investment vehicles for individual investors who do not have the expertiseor resources to assemble and manage a diversified investment portfolio.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See </T3>section III.B. of this release for a discussion of the discountwhich characterizes the share price of most closed-end funds. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See </T3>section 18(a) of the 1940 Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-18(a)).The number of closed-end funds has increased dramatically in recent years.\4\<NOTE/> Financial commentators have advanced a number of explanationsfor their increased popularity: that closed-end bond funds have receivedthe benefit of increased investor interest in debt, rather than equity,investments after the October 1987 Market Break; \5\<NOTE/> that the ability of closed-end    funds to provide leveragethrough the issuance of senior securities attracts investors with the prospectof higher rates of returns than non-leveraged open-end funds with similarinvestment objectives; \6\<NOTE/> and that brokerage firms have placed more emphasis on marketingclosed-end funds in the wake of the decline in initial public offeringsthat followed the October 1987 Market Break.\7\<NOTE/> In addition, certain closed-end funds have been used as vehiclesfor investing in foreign securities markets which may not otherwise bereadily accessible to United States investors.\8\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ According to the Investment Company Institute's Surveyof Closed End Funds (May 1, 1989), in 1985 there were 52 closed-end fundswith approximately $7.6 billion of assets. By the end of 1988 there were168 closed-end funds with approximately $40.8 billion of assets. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See </T3>Closed-End Funds: Answers to Questions, The Wall Street Journal,Sep. 14, 1988, at p. 37. Measured in terms of proceeds to the issuer, bondfunds represented 91% of the 69 new closed-end funds which came to marketin 1988.

F10; International Mutual Funds, The New York Times, Sep.26, 1987, at p. 38. The proposed amendments would make available to closed-end funds the kindof simplified prospectus previously adopted for other classes of investmentcompanies. In 1983 the Commission adopted Form N-1A (17 CFR 274.11A), theregistration form for mutual funds, which consists of three parts: a simplifiedprospectus, an SAI that must be provided to investors upon request, andother information that must be filed with the  Commission but not deliveredto investors.\9\<NOTE/> When Form N-1A was published for comment, the Commissionstated its intention to develop a simplified prospectus form for othertypes of investment companies.\10\<NOTE/> Since Form N-1A was adopted, the Commission has adopted FormsN-3 and N-4 (17 CFR 274.11b and 274.11c) for insurance company separateaccounts offering variable annuity contracts (``separate accounts''),\11\<NOTE/> and Form N-14 for the registration of securities issued incertain investment company business combination transactions \12\<NOTE/> using the same three part registration form with a simplifiedprospectus and an SAI. The Commission now is proposing amendments to FormN-2 to permit closed-end funds to use the same disclosure format.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Investment Company Act Rel. No. 13436 (Aug. 12, 1983)(48 FR 37928 (Aug. 22, 1983)). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Investment Company Act Rel. No. 12927 (Dec. 21, 1982)(48 FR 813 (Jan. 7, 1983)). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Investment Company Act Rel. No. 14575 (June 14, 1985)(50 FR 26145 (June 25, 1985)). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Investment Company Act Rel. No. 14796 (Nov. 14, 1985)(50 FR 48379 (Nov. 25, 1985)).  The two part disclosure document (prospectus and SAI) is based on the conclusionreached by the Commission in 1983 that a shortened and simplified prospectusis necessary to permit individual investors to assess matters of fundamentalimportance about the fund. The Commission believed that many of these investorswere discouraged from reading the prospectus by its   length and complexity.On the other hand, the Commission realized that some investors, such asinstitutional investors or investment advisers, may desire more detailedinformation about an investment company. To meet the needs of both of thesetypes of investors, the Commission developed Form N-1A under which a simplifiedprospectus is delivered to all investors, but more extensive informationis available to those investors who desire it.\13\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ In addition, the SAI provides the Commission with informationthat is important in its review of the prospectus and in assuring thatthe regulatory requirements of the 1940 Act are met.  Form N-2 is used by closed-end funds (except small business investmentcompanies licensed as such by the United States Small Business Administration,which use Form N-5 (17 CFR 274.5)) to register under the 1940 Act and registertheir securities under the 1933 Act. The Commission believes that the similaritiesbetween open-end and closed-end fund prospectus disclosure and the typeof investors who invest in these funds warrant extending the three partregistration statement format to closed-end funds. The simplified prospectusis intended to be more comprehensible and, accordingly, more likely tobe read by investors. This, the Commission hopes, will result in greateruse of the prospectus as the primary selling document for closed-end funds,which in turn should result in better informed investors.The Commission recognizes that there are important distinctions betweenclosed-end and open-end funds that might affect the desirability of usingthe two part disclosure format. First, closed-end funds are distributedthrough the use of a preliminary prospectus in underwritten offerings witha number of participants. This may result in as many as four documents(two prospectuses and two SAIs) being handled by participating underwritersand dealers. It may be difficult to ensure that participants in the distributionhave all of the prospectuses and SAIs and have systems in place to assuredelivery to prospective investors. However, under the proposals, underwritersand dealers would not have to distribute the SAI; they could direct theircustomers to a single source_<T3>e.g.,</T3> the managing underwriter (the phone number of which wouldbe on the cover of the prospectus)_to request it.\14\<NOTE/> In such a case, participants in a closed-end fund underwritingwould not have to deliver any more disclosure documents than in other offerings.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ <T3>See </T3>discussion of proposed cover page requirements <T3>infra</T3> at section III.A. of this release and the discussion ofthe relationship of the SAI to the preliminary prospectus in section VIof this release. The proposed amendment to rule 460 would distinguish betweendistribution requirements for preliminary prospectuses (a sufficient numberof which must be distributed to underwriters and dealers who have beeninvited to participate in the offering) and the SAI (which will have tobe available, but which need not be distributed to prospective underwritersand dealers). Second, closed-end fund shares are offered during a relatively short underwritingperiod (approximately 30 days).\15\<NOTE/> This makes it more difficult to devise a mechanism by whichan   investor can request and obtain an SAI before having to make an investmentdecision. To address the time constraints posed by closed-end fund offerings,the Commission is proposing a requirement, modeled after a similar instructionin Form N-14, that a telephone number to request an SAI be provided onthe cover page of the prospectus and the SAI be mailed within one businessday of receipt of the request.\16\<NOTE/> Comment is requested on these and other issues regardingthe appropriateness of the use of the two part disclosure format for closed-endfund registration statements. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Offerings periods in excess of 30 days may be made inreliance on rule 415 under the 1933 Act (17 CFR 230.415). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ <T3>See</T3> proposed Instruction H and the undertaking set forth in proposedItem 33.7. The Commission also believes that this problem will not be significantbased on its experience that most investors find the information in theprospectus sufficient and that only a small number of investors requestan SAI. Thus, the burden of actually responding to requests for the SAI,whether borne by dealers, the managing underwriters, or the fund, shouldnot be great. In addition to use of the three part registration statement format, theCommission is proposing revisions to Form N-2 that would enhance prospectusdisclosure about closed-end funds in certain key areas such as expenses,condensed financial information, the risk of shares trading at less thannet asset value, portfolio managers, dividend reinvestment plans, and charterand by-law provisions that would restrict a change of control of a closed-endfund. The revised form would also clarify the disclosure obligations ofclosed-end funds that have elected to be regulated as BDCs.\17\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ <T3>See</T3> discussion <T3>infra</T3> at section III.F. of this release.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Synopsis of the Amendments to Form N-2 </ITAG>As proposed to be amended, Form N-2 would contain three parts. Part A wouldbe the simplified prospectus that meets the requirements of section 10(a)under the 1933 Act, the delivery of which satisfies the prospectus deliveryrequirements of section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act (15 U.S.C. 77e(b)(2)).The prospectus would contain a concise presentation of essential informationabout the closed-end fund and its securities. Part B (the SAI) would includeadditional information about the fund, including its financial statements,that would not be required to be included in the prospectus (provided thatcertain conditions are met) but must be made available to investors uponwritten or oral request and without charge. More detailed discussions ofmatters required to be in the prospectus, as well as other items that mayinterest some investors, would be contained in the SAI. Part C would containother information about the fund required in the registration statementbut not required to be delivered to investors. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Proposed Amendments to Form N-2 </ITAG>A. General Instructions Part A of amended Form N-2 would contain instructions for the preparationof the prospectus. The instructions are similar to the instructions toForm N-1A with three exceptions. First, an instruction would be added toreduce from ten to seven the number of copies required by rules 402 and472 of Regulation C (17 CFR 230.402, 472) to be submitted when filing aregistration statement, and to reduce from eight to five the number ofcopies required when filing an amendment to a registration statement.\18\<NOTE/> Second, an instruction would be added directing the attentionof funds using rule 415 under the 1933 Act to the undertaking to file post-effectiveamendments required by proposed Item 33.4 of Form N-2.\19\<NOTE/> Third, as noted above, the instruction for use of the SAIwould be tailored to provide for timely delivery of the SAI within thetime constraints of a closed-end fund offering. Specifically, proposedInstruction H would require closed-end funds to (1) include a telephonenumber on the cover page of the prospectus for prospective investors touse to request the SAI,\20\<NOTE/> (2) provide a self-addressed card for requesting the SAIunless a toll-free telephone number is provided, and (3) send the SAI withinone business day of the receipt of the request by first class mail or othermeans designed to ensure equally prompt delivery.\21\<NOTE/> Closed-end funds would be required by proposed Item 33.7to undertake to send the SAI within one business day of receipt of therequest in the manner specified by the instruction.\22\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ <T3>See </T3>proposed Instruction C to Form N-2. The same reduction incopies has been made for variable annuity prospectuses. <T3>See </T3>Instruction C to Forms N-3 and N-4. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ <T3>See </T3>proposed Instruction E.3 to Form N-2. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ Although Form N-1A only requires the cover page to containa statement that the SAI is available upon request and without charge,most mutual funds include a telephone number for investors to use to requestthe SAI. <T3>See </T3>Item 1(a)(iii) of Form N-1A. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ These instructions are similar to General InstructionF to Form N-14 and reflect the time constraints of most closed-end fundofferings. <T3>See supra</T3> text accompanying notes 15 and 16.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ Items 37 (c) and (d) of Form N-3 and Items 32 (c) and(d) of Form N-4 require similar undertakings. B. Part A: The ProspectusPart A of amended Form N-2 would contain thirteen items. Many of the disclosureitems have not been substantially revised. Others have been revised toconform to the short-form prospectus disclosure requirements of Form N-lAor to provide the type of detail found in similar disclosure requirementsof Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229 <T3>et seq.</T3>).\23\<NOTE/> These types of changes are generally not addressed in detailin this release. The significant changes are discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ Appendix A to this Release contains a cross-referencetable indicating which items of Form N-2 are not being changed; which changesare derived from Form N-lA or Form N-3; which changes are derived fromRegulation S-K; and which changes represent new disclosure items. While,as noted above, closed-end funds have many characteristics in common withmutual funds, they also are similar to non-investment company issuers inthat they issue securities, in more traditional underwritings, which aresubsequently traded on exchanges or in the over-the-counter market. Wherethe disclosure item in Form N-2 concerns matters that closed-end fundshave in common with mutual funds, the provisions of the proposed revisionshave been drafted to parallel Form N-lA. Where the disclosure item in FormN-2 concerns matters that closed-end fund offerings have in common withofferings of non-investment company issuers, the proposed revisions havebeen drafted to parallel Regulation S-K. <ITAG tagnum="81">Item 1_Outside Front Cover Page </ITAG>Item 1 would be revised to require a closed-end fund to disclose on theoutside front cover page its name and type (<T3>e.g., </T3>bond fund, BDC, etc.), the title and amount of securitiesbeing offered, and the date of the prospectus (and SAI).\24\<NOTE/> The cover page would be required to include a statement thatthe prospectus sets forth concisely information about the fund, that itshould be retained for future reference, and that an SAI can be obtainedand how it may be requested.\25\<NOTE/> In addition, where the prospectus is used before effectivenessor omits information as permitted by rule 430A under the Securities Act(17 CFR 230.430A), the legend required by rule 481(b)(2) (17 CFR 230.481(b)(2))would be required to be placed on the prospectus cover.\26\<NOTE/> The cover page also would contain the table currently requiredby Form N-2 which sets forth the underwriting compensation and the amountof proceeds to the fund.\27\<NOTE/> However, in order to use terminology that is more familiarto investors in investment companies, the Commission is proposing to changethe caption on the table that currently refers to underwriting discountsto ``Sales Load''.\28\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that use of the term ``sales load''will improve investors' understanding of why the per share net asset valueof a closed-end fund which charges a sales load typically is less thanthe share price paid by investors in the offering.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ <T3>See </T3>proposed Items 1.1.a, 1.1.b, 1.1.c, and 1.1.e.

A new instruction is proposed to be addedto this item to notify funds that pay underwriting expenses by borrowingamounts instead of selling at a discount <T3>not</T3> to reflect those amounts in the table but to provide a cross-referenceto the text of the prospectus discussing the borrowed amounts. These amountswould also be disclosed in the fee table. <T3>See</T3> discussion <T3>infra</T3> at section III.B. of the release. Instructions would alsobe added similar to Instructions 3 and 4 to Item 501(c)(10) of RegulationS-K (17 CFR 229.501(c)(10)) concerning offerings made on a best effortsbasis and over-allotment options.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ <T3>See </T3>Instruction 2 to proposed Item 1.1.g. The underwriting discountconstitutes ``sales load'' under section 2(a)(35) of the 1940 Act (15 U.S.C.80a-2(a)(35)). Any compensation to underwriters or dealers that does notconstitute sales load will be set forth in a footnote to the table. Anyadditional offering expenses would be set forth in the footnote to thetable called for by Instruction 6 to proposed Item 1.1.g.In addition to these items of information, the Commission is proposingto require prominent disclosure on the cover of a prospectus used duringan initial offering stating that the Registrant's securities have no historyof public trading, and describing the tendency of closed-end funds frequentlyto trade in the secondary market at a price below net asset value and theiroffering price and the risk of loss this creates for those investors purchasingshares in the initial offering.\29\<NOTE/> A study recently completed by the Commission's Office ofEconomic Analysis demonstrates that a substantial decrease in the valueof shares quite often occurs shortly after the initial offering.\30\<NOTE/>    While some of the decrease is due to the sales load, thereappears to be, in many instances, a further reduction in share value belownet asset value that cannot be explained by the sales load. The significanceof this decrease and the likelihood of its occurrence shortly after aninitial offering of closed-end fund shares makes this material informationthat an investor would want to know before investing.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ <T3>See </T3>proposed Item 1.1.i. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ ``The Post-Offering Price Performance of Closed-End Funds,''July 21, 1989. Comment is requested on whether funds should be permitted to develop appropriatedisclosure describing the risks associated with closed-end fund discounts,as contemplated by the proposed item, or whether the Commission shouldrequire specific disclosure in the form of a prescribed legend describingthe discount phenomenon and, if so, what the prescribed legend should be.Commenters are asked to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of a standardizedlegend with those of providing some flexibility to funds in this area.If funds are permitted to develop their own disclosure, they must, of course,describe the frequency of closed-end fund discounts in a non-misleadingmanner. Disclosure creating the impression that closed-end fund sharesare as likely to trade at a premium as at a discount would not be adequate.Comment also is requested on whether disclosure of the type proposed wouldsufficiently inform investors of the risks associated with closed-end funddiscounts or whether additional, or different requirements should be prescribedand, if so, what those requirements should be. For example, to furtherinvestor understanding of the discount from the offering price attributableto underwriting commissions, should consideration also be given to requiringthat confirmations for sales of securities of closed-end funds in the initialoffering disclose these amounts as sales loads? The Commission recognizes that prospectus disclosure may not be usefulto persons who make a decision to purchase prior to receiving a prospectus.Accordingly, the Commission requests comment with respect to current industrypractice by brokers in disclosing the discount risk to customers. In addition,how should brokers consider the discount risk in making determinationswhether to solicit or otherwise recommend closed-end funds? <T3>See Hanly </T3>v. <T3>SEC, </T3>415 F.2d 589, 597 (2d Cir. 1969) (broker-dealer ``cannotrecommend a security unless there is an adequate and reasonable basis forsuch recommendation''). What effect, if any, would prominent prospectusdisclosure have on brokers sales practices with respect to closed-end funds?What is the responsibility of brokers who sell closed-end funds to disclosethe discount risk to their customers? Finally, comment is requested onwhether the discount disclosure requirements for closed-end bond fundsshould be different from those for equity funds.\31\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ The study found that bond funds trade at a negligiblediscount after 120 trading days. <T3>Id. </T3>However, one expert has found that bond funds have, over thepast ten years, traded at a discount of 3.96%. <T3>See </T3>Herzfeld, The People's Choice: Money Still Pouring In to Closed-EndFunds, Barron's, May 16, 1988, at 55. The Commission is proposing to requirethe disclosure on the cover of all closed-end fund prospectuses, includingbond funds, since there is an immediate decrease in the value of an investor'sinvestment.The Commission also is proposing that, where applicable, the cover of theprospectus contain a cross-reference to the sections of the prospectusthat describe any factors that would make the offering speculative or oneof high risk.\32\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ <T3>See </T3>proposed Item 1.1.j.

No. 16244 (Feb. 1, 1988) (53 FR 3192 (Feb. 4, 1988)).Amendments to Form N-3 and Form N-4 require a fee table in the registrationstatements used for variable annuity separate accounts. Investment CompanyAct Rel. No. 16766 (Jan. 23, 1989) (54 FR 4772 (Jan. 31, 1989)).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ Payments to preferred shareholders would not be requiredin a prospectus that offers only preferred shares. <T3>See </T3>Instruction 11 to proposed Item 3. The proposed fee table (``N-2 fee table'') is similar in many respectsto the table required by Form N-1A for mutual funds (``N-1A fee table'')\36\<NOTE/> except that it has been modified to reflect certain typesof closed-end fund expenses and to provide a method of calculating theseexpenses.\37\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ <T3>See </T3>Item 2(a)(i) of Form N-1A. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ Unlike the N-lA fee table, the proposed N-2 fee tabledoes not instruct the fund to look to the expenses during the last fiscalyear to determine the annual expenses, but rather instructs the fund tostate the basis on which the expenses are deducted or, if none, to estimatethe expenses that will be deducted. This is because most closed-end fundsdo not have any operating history prior to the use of their current prospectus.In this respect all closed-end funds would be treated like ``new'' mutualfunds (<T3>see</T3>  Instructions 11(a) and 13(b) to Item 2(a)(i) of Form N-1A) except that the ``Example,'' which sets out cumulative  expenses overone, three, five, and ten year periods, would  be required by the N-2 feetable to show expenses for each of the periods. Unlike ``new'' mutual funds,which are only required to show expenses for one and three year periods(<T3>see</T3> Instruction 14(e) to Item 2(a)(i) of Form N-1A), ``new'' closed-endfunds generally have a fixed capitalization and do not increase their assetsunder management by continuously offering their securities. Accordingly,closed-end funds have relatively stable expenses and extrapolating thoseexpenses into the future would produce meaningful information. The Commissionis requesting comment on how the table should be further adapted to accommodateBDCs. <T3>See </T3>discussion <T3>infra </T3>at section III.F of this release.  A new section of the N-2 fee table would show payments to preferred shareholders.While these distributions usually are not considered an ``expense'' ofa fund, these payments reduce earnings available for distribution to commonshareholders and as such represent a ``cost'' to those shareholders.\38\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ Similarly, interest payments on long-term debt, whichmay be part of the capitalization of a closed-end fund, would be includedamong the annual shareholder expenses. <T3>See </T3>Instruction 8 to proposed Item 3.1 of Form N-2. The proposed N-2 fee table would not be required to be included in prospectusesthat offer only debt securities, because the level of a fund's expensesshown on the N-2 fee table is much less important to an investor not havingan after-expense interest in the returns of a closed-end fund. These expensesshould not affect the anticipated return on a fund's debt securities, sincethe fund's obligations to meet the interest and repayment requirementsof these securities is not tied to the fund's yield or total return. Inaddition, the asset coverage requirements of the 1940 Act mitigate theeffects of a fund's expenses on the interest and repayment requirementsof debt securities, since they provide additional assurance that theseexpenses will be absorbed by the holders of common and preferred stock.\39\<NOTE/> The Commission requests comment on whether the informationthat would be included in the N-2 fee table would be material to purchasersof debt securities.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ Section 18(a)(1) of the 1940 Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-18(a)(1))requires a closed-end fund that offers debt securities to maintain a 300%net asset coverage immediately following the offering and on an ongoingbasis as a condition to declaring dividends and distributions. <ITAG tagnum="81">Item 4_Condensed Financial Information </ITAG>The Commission is proposing extensive revisions to the condensed financialinformation (``per share table'') contained in the prospectus. The revisionsare intended to shorten and simplify the per share table while providingmore useful and understandable information to investors. Some items wouldbe deleted, others added, and the captions of some rephrased to make themeasier to understand.The per share table summarizes the financial statements.\40\<NOTE/> It currently consists of thirteen items of information setout in columnar format for each of the last ten fiscal years of the fund.The first nine items set out the yearly income and capital changes of thefund on a per share basis. The last four items disclose certain fund ratios.Under the proposed revisions, the per share table would be reduced to tenitems. The current and proposed tables are set out below: <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ As proposed, the financial statements would be locatedin the SAI. Most closed-end fund prospectuses, since they are used onlyduring the initial offering, do not contain financial statements or a pershare table. As is the case with current Form N-2, the table would appearonly in a prospectus used in a subsequent offering or, if the fund issuessecurities in connection with a business combination, as part of a registrationstatement on Form N-14.   <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,xl200,xl200</C>  <H1>Current Table </H1><H1>Proposed Table</H1> <ITAG tagnum="21">Per share income and capital changes (for a share outstanding throughoutthe year) <R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1.

The deleted items, which served mainly to disclose fund expenses,would be reflected in the summarized expense information provided in theN-2 fee table, which would be required to be located near the per sharetable.\41\<NOTE/> Although the fee table would include only current expenseinformation, historical expense information, while not required in theprospectus, would be available for recent periods in the financial statementsincluded in the SAI.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ The information in Items 1 through 4 of proposed FormN-2 would be required to be set forth in numerical order in the prospectus,not preceded or separated by any other item. <T3>See </T3>General Instructions to Parts A and B of proposed Form N-2.The N-2 fee table, Item 3, would therefore precede the per share table,Item 4.Two items of information that set out net asset values at the beginningand end of each period and the net change in net asset value during eachperiod would be condensed so that only the net asset value of the fundat the end of each period (and, if the fund has been in operation for lessthan one year, its net asset value immediately after its initial publicoffering) would be set forth.\42\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ Since the net asset value at the end of one period willbe the same as the net asset value at the beginning of the next period,the current format for this information is repetitive. The proposed formatwill still permit investors to track fluctuations in net asset value fromone year to the next. A line would be added to set forth the total return of the fund for eachperiod. Currently, investors are only able to estimate overall performanceof a fund by analyzing the change in net asset value and distributionsduring a period. Inclusion of total return information in the prospectus\43\<NOTE/> should provide  more concise, precise, and useful informationregarding historical performance of a closed-end fund.\44\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ The Commission recently adopted amendments to rule 482(17 CFR 230.482), the ``omitting prospectus rule'' which, among other things,require that an advertisement of a mutual fund that contains performanceinformation disclose the fund's total return for the previous one, five,and ten year periods. <T3>See</T3> rule 482(e) under the 1933 Act (17 CFR 230.482(e)) and InvestmentCompany Act Rel. No. 16245 (Feb. 2, 1988) (53 FR 3868 (Feb. 10, 1988)).Nine commenters on the proposal of these amendments urged that total returnbe provided in the mutual fund prospectus (in lieu of advertisements).See Summary of Comments on Mutual Fund Advertising Proposals (March 31,1987) in File No. S7-23-86. The Commission expects to consider proposingfor comment similar amendments to the mutual fund per share table. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ Proposed Instruction 14 to the per share table specifiesthat, unlike the total return figures used in mutual fund advertisements,the per share table total return figures would be based on fiscal yearsand would not reflect sales loads. This is because the per share tableinformation (as well as the financial statements) report only direct fundexpenses, and because the year-by-year format makes it impractical to deducta sales load. The instruction would require the fund to include a noteto the per share table explaining the fact that these charges are not reflectedin total return. Finally, the instruction specifies that total return isto be calculated assuming that shares were purchased on the first day ofthe fiscal year and sold on the last day at the then-current market prices,and that all dividends and distributions were reinvested at prices obtainedby the fund's dividend reinvestment plan. If the fund does not have sucha plan, the instruction specifies that reinvestments shall be assumed tobe made at the per share net asset value on the date of distribution, unlessthe market value of the shares is less than the per share net asset value,in which case, the fund is directed to assume that dividends and distributionswere reinvested at market value. This method focuses on the investmentexperience of fund shareholders. Comment is requested on an alternate methodthat assumes that dividends and distributions are reinvested at the netasset value calculated on the date of distribution. Under this method ashareholder's total return generally will not match the total return setout in the per share table since share price will diverge from net assetvalue. The Commission proposes to replace the item requiring disclosure of the``number of shares outstanding during the period'' with disclosure of thenet assets of the fund at the end of the period. The number of shares outstandingis in-and-of-itself not significant financial information because the numberof shares is a function of both the size of the fund and the price of ashare, the latter of which is largely determined arbitrarily (<T3>e.g.,</T3> $10.00) at the time of the initial offering.\45\<NOTE/> However, the size of the fund (which currently can be determinedby multiplying the number of shares by the fund's per share net asset value)may be an important consideration for many investors in selecting a fund.For this reason, a line would be added to the Form N-2 per share tableto set out the closed-end fund's total net assets at the end of each period.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ The number of shares outstanding is important informationwith respect to voting control of the fund. Proposed Item 10.6 of FormN-2 would require a table disclosing the number of shares currently outstandingin the text of the prospectus. <ITAG tagnum="81">Items 5 and 6_Plan of Distribution and Selling Shareholders </ITAG>Revised Item 5 would require the disclosure of substantially the same informationcalled for by Item 4 of current Form N-2. In addition, the item would specificallyrequire a description of any arrangements under which an underwriter willperform administrative or custodial services for the Registrant;\46\<NOTE/> a statement of the underwriter's intention to proceed withthe offering if a material adverse change occurs prior to the time investorsare required to make an investment decision;\47\<NOTE/> and information with respect to the intention of underwritersto act as market makers for the fund's securities if they are not listedon a national securities exchange.\48\<NOTE/> These requirements are  intended to elicit information concerningthe continuing relationship between the underwriter and the fund, the completionof the underwriting of the fund's securities, and the likelihood of a secondarymarket in the fund's securities developing after the offering is completed.Disclosure concerning escrow arrangements for investor's funds, if applicable,and the date on which payment for securities must be made by investorsalso would be required.\49\<NOTE/> In addition, the sales load terminology has been incorporatedinto this item, consistent with the approach taken on the cover page. Finally,the information with respect to selling shareholders required by Item 507of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.507), some of which is currently called forby Item 4(e) of Form N-2, would be required to be set forth in responseto Item 6. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ <T3>See</T3> proposed Item 5.1.b. A more detailed description of theseservices would be required in the SAI in response to paragraphs 20.3 and20.4 of proposed Item 20. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ <T3>See</T3> proposed Item 5.1.d. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ <T3>See</T3> proposed Item 5.9. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ <T3>See</T3> proposed Items 5.6 and 5.7.<ITAG tagnum="81">Item 7_Use of Proceeds </ITAG>Revised Item 7 would require disclosure of the fund's principal use ofproceeds from the offering. This proposed item is similar to Item 5 ofForm N-2 but would require an additional item of information and includetwo new instructions. Instruction 2 would require funds using a materialamount of proceeds from the offering to discharge indebtedness to statethe interest rate and maturity of the indebtedness being retired.\50\<NOTE/> Instruction 3 would require funds intending to borrow moneyin connection with the offering to pay underwriting commissions or discountsto identify the lender and disclose the amount of the first installment,the rate of interest, the date on which payments will begin, the datesand amounts of subsequent installments, and the fact that interest paidwill not be available for investment purposes and will increase the expensesof the fund. Finally, Item 7.2 would require disclosure of the length oftime until the fund expects to invest net proceeds fully, the reasons forany anticipated lengthy delay in investing net proceeds, and the consequencesof any delay.\51\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ Instruction 2 to Item 5 of Form N-2 currently does notprovide specific guidance on this disclosure obligation. The language ofthis proposed instruction is derived from Instruction 4 to Item 504 ofRegulation S-K (17 CFR 229.504).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ Instruction 3 to proposed Item 7.1 and proposed Item7.2 would codify current disclosure practices. <ITAG tagnum="81">Item 8_General Description of the Registrant </ITAG>(1) <T3>Changes in Investment Policies. </T3>Proposed Item 8.2, which requiresthe fund to describe its investment objectives and policies, is substantiallythe same as Item 7 of Form N-2 and Item 4(a)(ii) of Form N-IA. Consistentwith the current form, proposed Item 8.2 would not require detailed disclosureof any policy that has not been used by the fund during the prior yearand which the fund does not contemplate using in the future, or which limitsa particular investment practice so that no more than 5 percent of thefund's net assets are at risk from the use of such practice.\52\<NOTE/> This item would be revised to require disclosure of whetherthe fund will provide any notice to its securityholders of a change ofsuch an investment policy.\53\<NOTE/> Often, a fund may change its policies from those set forthin the prospectus in a manner that, for example, may substantially increasethe level of risk involved in an investment in the fund. Unless the changerelates to certain policies specified by the 1940 Act as requiring a shareholdervote,\54\<NOTE/> or policies which the fund designates in its prospectus asonly being changeable by shareholder vote,\55\<NOTE/> funds would not be required to make securityholders awareof these policy changes.\56\<NOTE/> The proposed disclosure would alert investors to the riskthat policy changes may be made without their knowledge. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ The proposed item would include a new instruction onhow to calculate the percentage of assets which are at risk in connectionwith a particular practice. As noted in the instruction, the determinationshould be made by reference to the potential liability or loss which maybe incurred in connection with a particular practice (<T3>e.g., </T3>the potential loss if a fund sells a ``call'' option) andnot the amount the fund initially expends in connection with a particularpractice. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ <T3>See </T3>proposed Item 8.4.b.

TheCommission is proposing to modify this requirement in order to requiredisclosure that provides a more precise correlation between share priceand market discount or premium. Proposed Item 8.5 would require the prospectusto set forth historical market price information for the fund's commonstock for the preceding two full fiscal years, plus any subsequent interimfiscal period.\57\<NOTE/> Item 8.5 would also require the premium or discount of themarket prices to net asset value to be set forth. This information wouldinclude quarterly high/low price information and the corresponding premiumor discount of the market prices to net asset value. Item 8.6 would requirethe prospectus to disclose whether the fund's common stock has historicallytraded at a discount or premium to net asset value and to set forth intabular form the range of the discount or premium of market value to netasset value on a quarterly basis for the preceding two years.\58\<NOTE/> The purpose of these two sub-items would be to provide investorswith the historical market price information which generally is consideredsignificant in evaluating closed-end funds. The additional data   thatwould be required by Item 8.6 concerning the range of discounts and premiumsmay be necessary because the premium or discount corresponding to the high/lowmarket prices will not necessarily reflect those periods when the discountor premium to market value was at its highest or lowest. The Commissionrequests comment as to whether its proposed approach for disclosing marketprice information and discount/premium information would be helpful toinvestors, whether the time periods suggested are appropriate, whetherhigh/low net asset value information should continue to be included duringthe specified periods, and whether the Commission should consider makingthe information called for by proposed Items 8.5 and 8.6 available to shareholderson an annual basis in the proxy statement or annual report to shareholdersof closed-end funds.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\57\ Similar information is called for by Item 201(a) of RegulationS-K (17 CFR 229.201(a)). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\58\ Proposed Item 8.6 would also require disclosure of anymethods undertaken (or to be undertaken) to reduce any discount.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Item 9_Management </ITAG>Revised Item 9 of Form N-2 would require disclosure of how the fund ismanaged. This item is similar to Item 5 of Form N-lA and would consistof many of the disclosure requirements currently contained in Items 13through 15 of Form N-2, but would vary in two significant respects.\59\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\59\ Following the approach taken in Form N-1A, disclosureabout the fund's management would be abbreviated in the prospectus. Additionalinformation would be available in the SAI. <T3>See </T3>proposed Item 18 of Form N-2.  (1) <T3>Portfolio Managers. </T3>Item 9.1.c would require disclosure aboutall persons who significantly contribute to the fund's investment advice.Item 15 of Form N-2 currently requires   disclosure of the management responsibilitiesof the board of directors and the investment adviser of a closed-end fund,but does not require the name of any individual employed by the adviserof the fund, such as a portfolio manager, whose participation in providinginvestment advice may be important to fund investors. Item 9.1.c wouldrequire disclosure of each such person's name, title, business experience,and the period in the position with the fund. The disclosure of this informationis intended to make investors aware of the individuals who may not be namedas the investment adviser to the fund, but who nonetheless may have a significantimpact on the fund's investment success. This disclosure will permit investorsto assess the background and experience of such person and evaluate theextent of this person's responsibility for the previous investment success(or lack thereof) of the fund before making an investment decision.\60\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\60\ The Commission also is proposing to require total returndata to be included in the condensed financial information in the prospectus.<T3>See </T3>discussion, <T3>supra. </T3>The disclosure of changes in the portfolio manager wouldallow investors to evaluate the historical performance data in light ofthis information. The Commission expects to consider proposing for commentsimilar amendments to Form N-1A.  The Commission has twice proposed a similar disclosure requirement.\61\<NOTE/> In 1982, when Form N-1A was proposed for    comment, theCommission proposed that each fund identify any individual or committeethat managed twenty-five percent or more of the fund's portfolio.\62\<NOTE/> In 1984, as part of proposed Form N-SAR, the Commission proposedrequiring disclosure of the name of the fund's ``portfolio manager,'' theperson primarily responsible for the day-to-day task of managing the investmentportfolio.\63\<NOTE/> These proposals were not adopted primarily because of concernexpressed by commenters that, in many instances, the proposals could tendto arbitrarily label individuals as having material responsibilities forproviding investment advice to the fund. This, commenters asserted, wouldnot necessarily reflect the dynamics of the investment advisory function. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\ In addition, in 1972 the Commission published for commenta proposed staff Guideline to Forms S-4 and S-5 that would have requiredidentification of the three individuals who had the greatest responsibilityfor making portfolio investment determinations. <T3>See </T3>Investment Company Act Rel. No. 7219 (June 9, 1972) (37 FR12804 (June 29, 1972)). This guideline was never adopted. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\62\ <T3>See </T3>Investment Company Rel. No. 12927, <T3>supra </T3>note 10. The Commission explained that this disclosure requirementwas proposed because institutional investors were interested in obtainingthis information. Commenters argued, however, that institutional investorsalready had sufficient access to such information. As discussed above,the disclosure requirement proposed today is not based upon only the needfor institutional investors to have access to this information. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\63\ <T3>See </T3>Investment Company Act Rel. No. 14080 (Aug. 6, 1984) (49 FR32370 (Aug. 14, 1984)) (proposing Form N-SAR, the semi-annual report forregistered investment companies filed with the Commission pursuant to rule30b1-1 under the 1940 Act (17 CFR 270.30b1-1)).  To address these concerns, the proposed amendment has been drafted to limitrequired disclosure to only those persons who, under the organizationalarrangements of the investment adviser   (or of the fund, if internallymanaged), make a significant contribution to the investment advice receivedby the fund.\64\<NOTE/> The proposed amendment is based upon Item 401(c) of RegulationS-K (17 CFR 229.401(c)), which requires similar disclosure regarding employeeswho make, or are expected to make, significant contributions to the registrant'sbusiness, although they are not officers, directors, or control persons.Like those registrants subject to the Item 401(c) disclosure requirement,the success of a fund may be, ``to a large extent, contingent upon retainingsuch persons.'' \65\<NOTE/> The Commission requests comment on whether the proposed disclosurerequirement should be modeled after Item 401(c) or whether a differenttest with a more objective standard should be formulated for determiningwhen portfolio manager disclosure is required, and if so, what this testshould be. The Commission also requests comment as to whether additionaldisclosure should be required in the SAI discussing specifically the natureof the adviser's (or fund's) portfolio decision-making process, and therole in that process of any person listed in the prospectus in responseto this item.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\64\ Several closed-end funds have asserted the responsibilityof a single individual for portfolio management when seeking to includeprivate account performance data in the prospectuses of closed-end funds.<T3>See, e.g.</T3>, Growth Stock Outlook Trust, Inc. (pub. avail. Apr.15, 1986). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\65\ Securities Act Rel No. 5949 (July 28, 1978) (43 FR 34402(Aug. 3, 1978)) (incorporating Form S-1 (7 CFR 239.11) disclosure itemsregarding management of publicly held companies into Regulation S-K).(2) <T3>Non-resident Officers, Directors, Experts, and Advisers. </T3>The Commissionis proposing a new Item 9.2 which would require the fund to disclose limitationson the ability of investors to enforce the civil liability provisions ofthe federal securities laws against non-resident officers, directors, advisers,and experts named in the registration statement (``experts'') who havenot appointed an agent for service of process in the United States or whomaintain a substantial portion of their assets outside the United States.In recent years, many closed-end funds have registered with the Commissionwith investment objectives that involve substantial investment in foreignsecurities. These funds include ``global funds'' (funds investing in thesecurities of several countries, including the United States), ``internationalfunds'' (funds investing in the securities of several countries, excludingthe United States), and ``country funds'' (funds investing in a singlecountry or a geographically related group of countries). Often these fundshave non-resident directors, officers, advisers, or experts, who do notconsent to service of process or maintain a substantial amount of assetsin the United States. These non-resident persons may become liable to shareholdersunder the federal securities laws. Non-resident investment advisers to registered closed-end funds must, underrule 0-2 (17 CFR 275.0-2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C.80b <T3>et seq.</T3>) (``Advisers Act''), appoint an agent for service of processin the United States. Non-resident officers, directors, and experts offunds are under no such obligation. If such non-resident persons have notconsented to service of process within the United States, it may be impossiblefor an investor to obtain personal jurisdiction over them in a case allegingliability under the federal securities law. Even if personal jurisdictionis obtained, if these persons do not maintain assets in the United States,any judgment may be unenforceable because some foreign courts may not honorsuch judgments or because the cost of enforcing a judgment in a foreigncourt would be prohibitively expensive. Proposed Item 9.2 is based on Item 502(f) of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.502(f))and would require identification of each of these non-resident personsand a discussion of how enforcement of securities law judgments by investorsmay be affected by the fact that these persons are residents of foreigncountries and maintain a substantial portion of their assets outside ofthe United States. If the fund relies on the opinion of counsel in makingthis disclosure, a consent to the use of the counsel's name and opinionwould be required to be included as an exhibit to the registration statement.In addition to requiring this disclosure, the Commission seeks commenton whether non-resident officers, directors, and experts of closed-endfunds should be required to consent to service of process in the UnitedStates. Imposing this requirement would further the protection affordedto investors by the federal securities laws. Currently, rule 7d-1(b)(7)under the 1940 Act (17 CFR 270.7d-1(b)(7)) requires non-resident officersand directors of Canadian funds seeking to register with the Commissionpursuant to an order under Section 7(d) of the I940 Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-7(d))to execute a consent to service of process within the United States, and,as noted above, rule 0-2 under the Advisers Act also requires non-residentinvestment advisers to execute a consent. <ITAG tagnum="81">Item 10_Capital Stock, Long-Term Debt, and Other Securities </ITAG>Item l0 of amended Form N-2 would require disclosure about the capitalstock, long-term debt, and other securities issued by the fund. Althoughthe disclosure required by revised Item 10 would be essentially the sameas current prospectus disclosure requirements,\66\<NOTE/> Item 10 would address four additional matters.\67\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\66\ <T3>See </T3>Items 16 through 18 of Form N-2. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\67\ A fifth matter concerning BDCs is discussed <T3>infra </T3>at section III.F. of this release. (1) <T3>Guaranteed Distribution Programs. </T3>Instruction 2 to Item 10.1.awould clarify the disclosure obligation of funds with guaranteed distributionprograms. Under these programs, a closed-end fund guarantees investorsa minimum cash distribution or dividend payable at predetermined times.If fund earnings are insufficient to generate this minimum guaranteed amount,the fund may be required to liquidate a portion of its portfolio to fundthese distributions. The instruction would require disclosure about theseprograms, including a statement that the program may result in the reductionof the principal of a shareholder's investment, and a description of anytax consequences of the payments. (2) <T3>Dividend Reinvestment Plans. </T3>Item 10.1.e would require a fundthat offers a dividend reinvestment plan to shareholders to disclose thematerial aspects of the plan. These aspects would include how shareholdersmay apply to participate in the plan, how they may acquire additional informationabout the plan, how the plan operates, the income tax consequences of participationin the plan, how a shareholder may terminate participation in the planand shareholder rights upon termination, whether transferring brokerageaccounts will affect the ability of a shareholder to participate in theplan, expenses associated with participation in the plan, and, if a cashpurchase plan option is available, any minimum or maximum investment required.(3) <T3>Change of Control Provisions. </T3>Item 10.1.f would require disclosureabout any provision in the fund's charter or by-laws that would delay orprevent a change in control of the fund (``change of control provision'').Change of control provisions recently have been adopted by a number ofclosed-end funds. These provisions may affect the price of fund sharesand the ability of fund shareholders to sell shares at a premium over prevailingmarket price.\68\<NOTE/> The language of the proposed item is based on Item 202(a)(5)of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.202(a)(5)).\69\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\68\ Change in control provisions would include super-majorityvoting requirements on matters related to mergers or consolidations, classificationof directors with staggered terms of office, and provisions that increase,above state and federal statutory requirements, the votes required forthe removal of directors. See Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 15230 (Oct.13, 1978) (43 FR 49863 (Oct. 25, 1978)) (discussing disclosure requirementsfor proxy and information statements containing change of control provisions).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\69\ The instructions to this item are also being amendedto clarify that disclosure is not required in response to revised Item10.5 with respect to a control person who is an adviser or underwriterto the fund and would not control the fund immediately after the publicoffering. (4) <T3>Security Ratings. </T3>Finally, Item 10.7 would require a fund whichissues senior securities rated by a nationally recognized securities ratingorganization (``NRSRO'') \70\<NOTE/> to discuss, if the rating is disclosed in the prospectus,the significance of the rating and the basis upon which the rating is issued,any conditions or guidelines imposed by the NRSRO for maintaining the rating,and whether or not the fund intends, or has any contractual obligation,to comply with these conditions or guidelines. Item 10.7 would also requiredisclosure of the material terms of any agreement between the fund andthe NRSRO under which the NRSRO provides the rating. Instruction 3 to proposedItem 10.7 would also refer funds to the statement of the Commission's viewson important matters to be considered in disclosing security ratings setforth in Regulation S-K.\71\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\70\ The term ``nationally recognized securities rating organization''is defined in rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) (17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F))under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a <T3>et seq.</T3>) (``1934 Act''). The Commission permits registrants todisclose, on a voluntary basis, ratings assigned by rating organizationsto classes of debt securities, convertible debt securities and preferredstock in registration statements. <T3>See </T3>Regulation S-K, General (17 CFR 229.10). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\71\ <T3>Id.</T3>Ratings are generally material to investors who use these ratings to assessthe creditworthiness of the issuer of the senior securities, or who arerequired by law or otherwise to invest in securities which are assigneda specified rating. A rating, the conditions for maintaining it, and theconsequences of failing to do so (such as the occurrence of an event ofdefault with respect to the senior securities), may also be material toinvestors in the fund's common shares, even if the shares themselves arenot rated, since these factors may have a significant effect on the fund'sinvestment policies and performance. The disclosures called for by proposedItem 10.7 are designed to elicit material information with respect to ratingsand reflects current disclosure practices. <ITAG tagnum="81">Item 12_Legal Proceedings </ITAG>Item 12 of Form N-2 (currently Item 10) requires disclosure of materialpending legal proceedings.

C. Part B: The Statementof Additional Information Most of the items in the SAI are similar to those in Form N-lA or, in thecase of Item 23 (Financial Statements), substantially the same as the currentform, and are therefore not discussed in this release.\74\<NOTE/> New disclosure requirements are addressed below.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\74\ <T3>See </T3>the cross-reference table in Appendix A to this release. <ITAG tagnum="81">Item 14_Cover Page </ITAG>The cover page of an SAI used prior to the effective date of the registrationstatement would be required to contain the legend set forth in proposedrule 481(g).\75\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\75\ <T3>See infra, </T3>Section VI of this release. <ITAG tagnum="81">Item 18_Management </ITAG>Revised Item 18 would add a new Item 18.3 that would require funds withany non-resident directors or officers that have authorized an agent toreceive service of process to disclose the name and address of the agent.<ITAG tagnum="81">Item 19_Control Persons and Principal Holders of Securities </ITAG>Item 11 of Form N-2 currently requires a fund to disclose information aboutpersons who control the closed-end fund as of a date not more than ninetydays prior to the filing of the registration statement or amendment.

Part C: Other Information Part C of revised Form N-2 would contain information required to be inthe registration statement but not in the prospectus or the SAI. Exceptfor certain new exhibits and undertakings, Part C would require informationthat is essentially the same as that currently required by Part II of FormN-2. The exhibit requirements, Item 24 of the revised form, would be amendedto include, where applicable, a copy of the fund's dividend reinvestmentplan and, if any non-resident director, officer, expert, or adviser tothe fund has executed a consent to service of process, a copy of that consent.\76\<NOTE/> An   instruction would be added to clarify that an exhibitwhich has been filed as part of the registration statement is not requiredto be refiled as part of a post-effective amendment unless there has beena change to the exhibit, except with respect to exhibits that consist ofopinions or consents of experts named in the registration statement.\77\<NOTE/> Finally, Instruction 1 would be revised to specify what shouldbe included in a cross-reference to a previously filed exhibit in orderto facilitate locating it in the prior filing.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\76\ <T3>See </T3>proposed Items 24.2.e and 24.2.m.

Instruction 2 to bothItem 28 of Form N-3 and Item 24 of Form N-4 is similar. Four new undertakings would be required by the amendments to be includedas exhibits. The first new undertaking would codify a closed-end fund'sobligation under sections 15(a) and 32(a) of the 1940 Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-15(a)and 31(a)) to submit its investment advisory agreement(s) and the selectionof its independent accountants to shareholders for approval at the firstregular or special meeting of shareholders.\78\<NOTE/> This undertaking would end some confusion regarding a fund'sobligation under those sections and assure that votes in these mattersare taken by ``public'' shareholders.\79\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\78\ Proposed Item 33.6. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\79\ The Commission has interpreted shareholder approval underSections 15(a) and 32(a) of the 1940 Act with respect to these mattersto mean ``public'' shareholder approval. This interpretation was originallyincluded in staff Guidelines to Forms S-4 and S-5 (the predecessors toForms N-1 and N-2) in the form of similar required undertakings. InvestmentCompany Act Rel. No. 7220 (June 9, 1972) (37 FR 12790 (July 29, 1972)).Forms N-1 (17 CFR 274.11) and N-2 did not incorporate these guidelinesbecause the Commission believed they were unnecessary since these obligationswere already required by the 1940 Act. Investment Company Act Rel. No.9782 (May 31, 1977) (42 FR 29716 (June 9, 1977)).

Item 37(d) of Form N-3and Item 32(c) of Form N-4 require a similar undertaking. The third proposed new undertaking would be required to be made when, inreliance on rule 415 under 1933 Act, a closed-end fund proposes to offersecurities on a delayed or continuous basis (``shelf offering'').\81\<NOTE/> The undertaking would require such a fund to file a post-effectiveamendment containing, among other things, certain changes in the informationpreviously disclosed, to assume 1933 Act liability for each such post-effectiveamendment filed, and to remove from registration any securities that remainunsold at the termination of the offering. Such an undertaking is a conditionof using rule 415 to make a shelf offering.\82\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\81\ Proposed Item 33.4.

In addition, a new Instruction 3to proposed Item 24 would be added to permit exhibits to be filed thatomit certain price-related information when the information is providedin a prospectus filed with the Commission under rule 497(b) (17 CFR 230.497(b))after effectiveness of the registration statement, rather than being includedin an amendment to the registration statement. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\84\ Rule 430A(a)(2) (17 CFR 230.430A(a)(2)) and Item 512(j)of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.512(j)). E. Summary Prospectuses The Commission is proposing to delete the instructions in Form N-2 foruse of a summary prospectus. Summary prospectuses have rarely been usedby closed-end funds; their need has been superseded by the availabilityof rule 482 under the 1933 Act which permits information that could becontained in a summary prospectus to be included in an ``omitting prospectus.''\85\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\85\ Under rule 482, an investment company advertisement isdeemed to be a ``prospectus'' under section 10(b) of the 1933 Act (15 U.S.C.77j(b)) if it contains information the substance of which is containedin the statutory prospectus and states from whom a prospectus containingmore complete information may be obtained and that the investor shouldread the prospectus carefully before investing. F. Business DevelopmentCompanies \86\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\86\ A business development company is a closed-end fund that(1) is operated for the purpose of making investments in small and developingbusinesses, (2) makes available ``significant managerial assistance'' toits portfolio companies, and (3) has elected to be subject to Sections55 through 65 of the 1940 Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-54 through 80a-64). <T3>See </T3>section 2(a)(48) of the 1940 Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(48)).A closed-end fund that has elected to be regulated as a business developmentcompany (``BDC'') is not required to register under the 1940 Act, but isrequired to register its securities under the 1933 Act on Form N-2.\87\<NOTE/> While BDCs are similar to other closed-end funds, there areseveral significant differences which give rise to different disclosureobligations. In contrast to most closed-end funds, which are passive investors,BDCs are organized to provide both investment capital and operational ormanagerial assistance to small and developing companies. Regulation ofBDCs under the 1940 Act reflects these differences.\88\<NOTE/> Sections 57, 61(a), and 63 of the 1940 Act, respectively,provide BDCs with greater flexibility with respect to dealings with portfoliocompanies, issuing securities, and in compensating management.\89\<NOTE/> Prospectus disclosure of these aspects of a BDC's operationswere addressed by the Division of Investment Management in a 1981 staffinterpretive release.\90\<NOTE/> The Commission is now proposing to incorporate these staffinterpretations into Form N-2. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\87\ <T3>See </T3>General Instruction A to Form N-2. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\88\ The Small Business Investment Incentives Act of 1980,Pub. L. No. 96-477, Sections 201-203, 94 Stat. 2275 (1980), amended the1940 Act to provide this flexibility. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\89\ 15 U.S.C. 80a-56, 80a-60(a), and 80a-62.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\90\ Investment Company Act Rel. No. 11703 (Mar. 26, 1981)(46 FR 19459 (Mar. 31, 1981)). The proposed amendments would add a new instruction to revised Item 4 exemptingBDCs from the requirement to include a per share table in the prospectus.\91\<NOTE/> However, BDCs would be required to include financial disclosurecomparable to that provided by non-investment company issuers, <T3>i.e., </T3>management's discussion and analysis of financial conditionand results of operations, supplementary financial information, and selectedfinancial data.\92\<NOTE/> Comment is requested on whether BDCs should be required toinclude their financial statements in the prospectus rather than the Statementof Additional Information, as permitted by Item 23.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\91\ Instruction 1 to proposed Item 4.1. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\92\ Proposed Item 4.2 of Form N-2 would require the fundto furnish the information called for by Items 301, 302, and 303 of RegulationS-K (17 CFR 229.301, 229.302, and 229.303). The 1981 staff interpretativerelease did not require BDCs to furnish the supplementary financial informationrequired by Item 302 of Regulation S-K. However, such information is requiredto be furnished in a BDC's annual report on Form 10-K (17 CFR 249.310).Proposed Item 4.2 will conform the prospectus disclosure with that requiredby Form 10-K. Closed-end funds would be required by revised Item 8 to disclose informationabout their organization and proposed operations. Proposed Item 8.7 wouldrequire additional disclosure by BDCs regarding their portfolio companiesand any investment in a wholly-owned small business investment companysubsidiary (``subsidiary''). Item 8.7.a would require disclosure of materialinformation about the portfolio companies in which the BDC is investing,including: the name and address of the companies; the nature of the companies'businesses; the title, class, percentage of class, and value of all securitiesof the portfolio companies held by the BDC; the amount and general termsof loans to portfolio companies; and the relationship of the companiesto the BDC. Item 8.7.b would require a BDC with a subsidiary to disclosewhether the subsidiary is regulated as a BDC or as an investment companyunder the 1940 Act, the percentage of the parent company's assets thatare invested in the subsidiary, and information about the small businessinvestment company's operations, including material differences in investmentpolicies between the parent company and the subsidiary. Item 8.7.c wouldrequire disclosure by a company that has had operations prior to electingto be regulated as a BDC regarding anticipated changes in operation asa result of being subject to section 55 of the 1940 Act (15 U.S.C. 80(a)-54),which prohibits a BDC from acquiring any assets that would result in itholding less than 70 percent of its assets in certain qualifying investmentsdescribed in that section.\93\<NOTE/> Item 8.7.d would require disclosure of the special risksassociated with investing in a BDC, including the risks associated withinvesting in a portfolio of small and developing or financially troubledbusinesses.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\93\ The Commission is proposing an instruction to Item 23,which requires the fund to provide financial statements and schedules requiredby Regulation S-X (17 CFR 210 <T3>et seq.</T3>), to require a BDC's portfolio schedule to indicate whichinvestments are not qualifying investments for purposes of Section 55 andto include a footnote explaining the significance of non-qualification.Revised Item 9 of Form N-2 would require disclosure about a BDC's management.In contrast to other closed-end funds, most BDCs are internally managedand have the ability to pay special compensation to management, <T3>i.e., </T3>to set up profit-sharing and executive compensation plans.\94\<NOTE/> Proposed Instruction 2 to Item 9.1.a would require a BDCto disclose any special compensation arrangements available. In addition,BDCs provide significant managerial assistance to their portfolio companies.Proposed Instruction 2 to Item 9.1.b(2) would require a description ofthe type of managerial assistance that would be provided to the portfoliocompanies and the qualifications of the investment adviser to provide suchmanagement assistance.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\94\ <T3>See </T3>Section 57(n) and 61(a)(3)(B) under the 1940 Act (15 U.S.C.80a-56(n), 80a-60(a)(3)(B)). BDCs often have transaction and management fee structures that differ significantlyfrom most closed-end companies. These fees may take the form of subordinatedfees (<T3>i.e., </T3>fees which are only payable if certain financial criteriaare met); fees based on the amount of funds invested in portfolio companies;one-time advisory fees payable at the closing of the offering; and specialpartnership interests which are in the nature of management compensation.BDCs will be expected to provide comprehensible and meaningful disclosurein response to proposed Item 3.1, the N-2 fee table, even if such disclosurerequires the development of expense categories not provided for in proposedForm N-2, and the inclusion of items that may not, for accounting purposes,be treated as expenses. The Commission specifically requests comment onwhether any BDC-specific items should be included in the N-2 fee table,or whether disclosure would be enhanced if BDCs are given additional flexibilityto develop fee tables to meet their specific situations. Comment also isrequested as to whether any further modifications to Form N-2 are neededto assure full disclosure by BDCs while accommodating their particularcharacteristics. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Staff Guidelines </ITAG>Form N-1A is accompanied by a series of staff guidelines designed to facilitatethe registration process for mutual funds. Appendix C to this release containsnine draft staff guidelines to accompany Form N-2.\95\<NOTE/> In addition, because many of the disclosure items in theproposed revision of Form N-2 are the same as those contained in Form N-lA,the instructions to the draft Guidelines to Form N-2 direct closed-endfunds to other applicable guidelines, which are not repeated in the Guidelinesto Form N-2.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\95\ Unless the guidelines incorporate rules of the Commission,they do not have the force of rules promulgated by the Commission. The draft Guidelines set forth current staff positions on the period oftime which a Registrant has to invest the proceeds from an offering (Guide1); required disclosures with respect to share repurchase programs designedto reduce the discount to net asset value of a Registrant's share marketprice and other issues relating to fund tender offers (including ``odd-lot''tender offers) (Guide 2) \96\<NOTE/>; change of control provisions in a Registrant's charter (Guide3); undertakings to convert to openend status (Guide 4); dividend reinvestmentplans (Guide 5); required disclosures in connection with leveraged capitalstructures (Guide 6); suggested synopsis disclosure (Guide 7); continuousofferings under rule 415 (Guide 8); and investing in foreign securities(Guide 9).   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\96\ In Investment Company Act Rel. No. 3548 (Oct. 3, 1962)(27 FR 9987 (Oct. 11, 1962)) (``share repurchase release'') the Commissiondiscussed the provisions of the 1940 Act and rule 10b-5 (17 CFR 240.10b-5)under the 1934 Act applicable to share repurchases by closed-end investmentcompanies. In that release, the Commission suggested that closed-end investmentcompanies contemplating share repurchases consult with the Division ofCorporate Regulation (the predecessor of the Division of Investment Management)about the nature of disclosures in connection with share repurchases. Sincethe date of the share repurchase release, the Commission has adopted anumber of rules and regulations under the 1934 Act applicable to sharerepurchases with which closed-end funds must comply in connection withtheir share repurchase programs. The 1934 Act and these rules and regulationsrequire certain types of disclosures and impose other legal requirementswhich are administered by the Office of Trading Practices of the Divisionof Market Regulation and the Office of Tender Offers of the Division ofCorporation Finance. Funds contemplating share repurchases should be familiarwith the applicable requirements of these rules and regulations. To theextent the share repurchase release may suggest that the issues involvingshare repurchases are solely disclosure issues administered by the Divisionof Investment Management, it is incorrect. Comment is requested on the issues addressed by the guidelines in orderto assist the staff in developing guidelines to amended Form N-2. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Annual Updating </ITAG>Rule 8b-16 under the 1940 Act requires investment companies, includingclosed-end funds, to update their registration statements with the Commissionon an annual basis.\97\<NOTE/> Mutual funds, which are in continuous registration underthe 1933 Act, are also, in effect, required by sections 10(a)(3) (15 U.S.C.77j(a)(3)) and 5(b) (15 U.S.C. 77e(b)) of the 1933 Act to update theirregistration statements at least annually and to deliver an updated prospectusto their shareholders before (or at the time of) confirming the sale ofany additional shares.\98\<NOTE/> In contrast, closed-end funds do not generally make a publicoffering of shares after the initial offering and therefore update theirregistration statements only to comply with rule 8b-16. In most cases,the updated prospectuses are not distributed to investors. The Commissionis considering exempting closed-end funds from rule 8b-16, provided thatcertain critical updating information about the fund, which otherwise mightnot be available to shareholders, is provided in the annual report to shareholders. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\97\ Certain items in Form N-2 relating to the distributionof fund shares are not required to be included in the prospectus when itis updated only for purpose of rule 8b-16. <T3>See </T3>General Instruction F.3 to Form N-2. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\98\ Under section 5(b)(1) (15 U.S.C. 77e(b)(1)), it is unlawfulto transmit a prospectus by use of any means of interstate commerce forwhich a registration statement has been filed, unless it meets the requirementsof section 10 (15 U.S.C. 77(j)). Section 2(10)(a) of the 1933 Act (15 U.S.C.77b(10)(a)) defines the term ``prospectus'' to include a confirmation ofthe sale of the security. Section 2(10)(b) of the 1933 Act (15 U.S.C. 77b(10)(b))excludes from the definition of a ``prospectus'' communications (includinga confirmation) accompanied or preceded by a prospectus meeting the requirementsof section 10. Under section 10(a)(3) of the 1933 Aot, information containedin a prospectus used more than nine months after the effective date ofthe registration statement must be dated within sixteen months prior toits use. Rule 8b-16 was adopted in 1978 to ensure that there is a central sourceof current and complete information about closed-end funds available toinvestors and Commission staff.\99\<NOTE/> However, this data source appears to be used infrequently,possibly because investors are not aware of the amendments, which are filedwith the Commission but not transmitted to shareholders. The Commissionstaff does not use the amendments because information needed for regulatorypurposes is contained in semi-annual reports on Form N-SAR (17 CFR 274.101),which are filed by closed-end funds.\100\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\99\ Investment Company Act Rel. No. 10378 (Aug. 28, 1978)(43 FR 39548 (Sept. 5, 1978)). <T3>See also </T3>Investment Company Act Rel. No. 9782 (May 31, 1977) (42FR 29716 (June 9, 1977)) (proposing rule 8b-16).    <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\100\ <T3>See </T3>rule 30b1-1 (17 CFR 270.30bl-1).In order to reduce their filing burden, the Commission is proposing toexempt closed-end funds from rule 8b-16. However, as a condition to theexemption, the Commission is proposing to require that certain importantinformation be provided to shareholders (and the trading markets) in theannual report to shareholders. This information would include: informationabout the fund's dividend reinvestment plan, if it has one; material changesin the fund's investment policies that have not been approved by shareholders;changes in any change of control provision that have not been approvedby shareholders; material changes in the principal risk factors associatedwith an investment in the fund; and any changes in the portfolio manager(s)and the business experience of the new portfolio manager. The scope ofeach disclosure requirement is keyed to an item in Form N-2. Except forinformation about the fund's dividend reinvestment plan, which would haveto include a description of the plan as complete as the one required byproposed Item 10.1.e of Form N-2, only changes that have occurred duringthe year covered by the annual report would be required to be disclosed,and, therefore, most annual reports should include little additional disclosure.\101\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\101\ A complete description of a dividend reinvestment planwould probably be of interest to all investors in a fund, since their decisionto participate in the plan may vary from year to year depending upon theirfinancial needs. It may be of particular interest to those investors whopurchased their shares in the secondary market and never received a prospectus.The disclosure required to satisfy the condition for exemption from rule8b-16 would otherwise be required in amendments to registration statementsunder rule 8b-16, if the proposed revisions to Form N-2 are adopted. Therefore,the Commission believes that the proposed rule amendments would overallreduce burdens on funds. Comment is requested, however, particularly fromusers of closed-end fund disclosure documents, on whether the requiredadditional annual report disclosure would be an adequate substitute forthe more detailed updating amendments to registration statements currentlyrequired by rule 8b-16. Finally, comment is requested as to the adequacyof information about closed-end funds in the secondary market in general.Do investors and market professionals have access to sufficient informationto make knowledgeable investment decisions concerning closed-end funds?Should the Commission consider requiring periodic reports such as thosefiled by operating companies on Forms 10-K and 10-Q (17 CFR 249.308a)?\102\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\102\ Closed-end funds are exempt from the reporting requirementsof sections 13 and 15(d) of the 1934 Act (15 U.S.C. 78m and 78<T3>o</T3>(d)) by rule 30a-1 under the 1940 Act (17 CFR 270.30a-1). <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Rules Relating to SAI Delivery Requirements  </ITAG>As discussed in Section I of this Release, a preliminary SAI would be requiredto be delivered on request to investors who receive a preliminary prospectusincluded in a registration statement on Form N-2. The Commission is proposinga new rule and amendments to several rules to implement this requirementand to clarify the status of a preliminary SAI under the 1933 Act. Theserules generally would be applicable to all investment company registrationstatements that use the two part disclosure format. Rule 430 under the 1933 Act provides for use of a preliminary prospectusduring the period after the filing of a registration statement but beforeeffectiveness. The Commission is proposing an amendment to add a new paragraphto rule 430 that would require an investment company filing a registrationstatement using the two part disclosure format to have filed an SAI andto make it available to persons receiving a preliminary prospectus. Rule460 currently provides that the Commission will consider, in determiningwhether to accelerate the effective date of a registration statement, whethersufficient copies of the preliminary prospectus have been made availableto prospective underwriters and dealers. The Commission is proposing toamend this rule to add as a consideration, in the case of a closed-endfund,\103\<NOTE/> a similar requirement with respect to the SAI. However, thenew paragraph would permit copies of the preliminary SAI, unlike the preliminaryprospectus, to be made available to the managing underwriter, dealer orother source specified on the cover page of the preliminary prospectusrather than to <T3>each </T3>prospective underwriter or dealer.\104\<NOTE/> Proposed rule 481(g) would set forth the legend requiredto appear on an SAI used prior to the effective date of the registrationstatement or the completion of information which may be omitted under rule430A.\105\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\103\ As noted in Part I of this release, it is the Commission'sunderstanding that open-end funds and separate accounts generally do notuse preliminary prospectuses. Thus, compliance with the preliminary prospectusdistribution requirement of rule 460 generally has not been taken intoaccount in considering acceleration requests relating to registration statementson which such investment companies register their shares. In proposingthe amendments and proposed rule 134b, the Commission is not suggestingthat open-end funds and separate accounts distribute preliminary prospectuses.The amendment to rule 460 is, by its terms, only applicable to registrationstatements filed on Form N-2. However, the proposed amendment to rule 430would make clear that if investment companies using Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3,and N-4 choose to distribute a preliminary prospectus, a preliminary SAImust be made available. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\104\ Funds may also satisfy this requirement by making sufficientcopies of the preliminary SAI available to prospective underwriters anddealers. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\105\ The Commission also is proposing an amendment to rule430A which will clarify that the information which may be omitted froma form of prospectus in a registration statement which is declared effectivealso may be omitted from the form of SAI contained in the registrationstatement.The Commission also proposes to clarify the status of the preliminary SAIunder section 5 of the 1933 Act (15 U.S.C. 77e). When an SAI is deliveredafter the effective date of a registration statement, it does not constitutea prospectus as long as a prospectus meeting the requirements of section10(a) of the 1933 Act was delivered to the recipient prior to or at thesame time as the SAI.\106\<NOTE/> However, no statutory safe harbor  exists with respect tothe use of a preliminary SAI, since it would be used prior to the effectivedate of the registration statement.\107\<NOTE/> Proposed rule 134b would provide an explicit ``safe harbor''under section 5(b) of the 1933 Act for the use of an SAI prior to the effectivedate of the registration statement. It provides, in effect, that an SAIaccompanied or preceded by a preliminary prospectus is not a ``prospectus''for purposes of section 5(b) of the 1933 Act. The safe harbor is conditionedon the delivery of the preliminary prospectus with or prior to the deliveryof the SAI. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\106\ <T3>See</T3> section 2(10) of the 1933 Act (15 U.S.C. 77b(10)). Thus, anSAI constitutes supplemental sales material, subject to the liability provisionsof section 17(a) of the 1933 Act (15 U.S.C. 77g(a)) and section 10(b) ofthe 1934 Act (15 U.S.C. 78j(b)) and rule 10b-5 thereunder. <T3>See</T3> rule 156 under the 1933 Act (17 CFR 230.156). In addition,since the SAI is part of the registration statement, it is also subjectto the liability provisions of section 11 under the 1933 Act (15 U.S.C.77k). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\107\ Section 5(b) of the 1933 Act prohibits the transmissionof any prospectus unless the prospectus meets the requirement of section10. Rule 430 specifically provides that a preliminary prospectus meetingthe conditions specified in that rule is deemed to meet the requirementsof section 10. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Miscellaneous Rule Amendments </ITAG>The Commission is proposing to use in Form N-2 the same type of disclosureformat adopted in connection with Form N-1A. Rules 495, 496, and 497 underthe 1933 Act and rules 8b-11 and 8b-12 under the 1940 Act implement thethree-part disclosure format. The Commission is now proposing amendmentsto these rules to accommodate Form N-2. The Commission also is proposing for comment a clarifying amendment torule 463 under the 1933 Act, which requires that  certain issuers filereports on Form SR with respect to the use of proceeds from their initialpublic offerings. Registered investment companies are not required to filethese reports and the amendment would make it clear that this exemptionextends to BDCs. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Cost/Benefit Analysis </ITAG>The revisions to Form N-2 proposed today for public comment are intendedto shorten and simplify the prospectus provided to investors and to improvethe quality of prospectus disclosure. The proposed revisions should benefitinvestors by providing them with a shorter, more readable, and more informativedocument. Because the proposed revisions would shorten the prospectus,the revisions should reduce the burdens of preparing and the cost of mailingthe prospectus for closed -end funds and their underwriters. Those additionalitems of disclosure that would be required (<T3>e.g.,</T3> the fee table, information about the portfolio manager)call for disclosure of information readily available to the fund. In addition,elimination of the rule 8b-16 annual updating requirement should eliminatea burden currently imposed on closed-end funds without significantly diminishingthe information available to investors, since, as a condition to the exemption,certain material information would be provided to shareholders in the annualreports funds are required to deliver to shareholders. The Commission wouldlike to develop specific data concerning these issues and is seeking publiccomment concerning the cost savings or cost burdens to closed-end fundsof all sizes affected by these proposals. In this regard, the Commissionrequests specific comment on the effect which the proposals might haveon the costs of smaller closed-end funds. <ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>The Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysisin accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 regarding the proposed amendments. Theanalysis notes that the proposed amendments are intended to simplify disclosureand update the form. Other appropriate cost-benefit information reflectedin the section of this release titled ``Cost/Benefit Analysis'' is alsoreflected in the Analysis.

Viewed from this perspective, the major contribution of the Office of EconomicAnalysis' recent study of closed-end funds is not to discover that closed-enddomestic equity funds trade at a discount. We already know that. Instead,the contribution of the OEA study is to document the path followed by theprices of recently offered closed-end domestic equity fund shares as theydecline from their initial offering price, which reflects net asset valueplus a sales load, to their aftermarket price, which reflects a discountfrom net asset value. The OEA Study, which is based on data drawn from1985-1987 market experience, finds that after 24 weeks closed-end domesticequity funds trade, on average, at a discount of approximately ten percent.Beyond this point, there appears to be no systematic change in the sizeof the discount on closed-end domestic equity funds. This large body of empirical evidence raises some intriguing questionsabout the IPO market for closed-end domestic equity funds. In particular,if an investor has a choice between purchasing shares of a closed-end domesticequity fund in its IPO and purchasing shares of the same fund in the aftermarket,the   aftermarket purchase is clearly preferable. The reason for this conclusionis simple: if a closed-end fund is a good investment at an offering priceof, say, $10.50, then it is that much of a better buy in the aftermarketat a price of $9.00 where the same shares are soon trading at a discountfrom net asset value.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Of course, this assumes that the net asset value of thefund does not increase so quickly that the investor winds up earning aprofit even after the fund trades at a discount. Given the magnitude ofdiscounts and the probability of such significant run-ups in net assetvalue during the immediate aftermarket, the assumption implicit in thetext seems quite reasonable. This observation suggests, however, that no new closed-end domestic equityfunds could ever successfully be brought to market because no one wouldever want to purchase shares of those funds in the IPO. Investors would,instead, prefer to acquire those same shares in the secondary market wherea discount prevails.\7\<NOTE/> This characterization of the market obviously does not accuratelydescribe reality because we in fact observe successful IPOs of closed-endfunds that rapidly and systematically trade to significant discounts.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Put another way, the public offering of a closed-end domesticequity fund's shares is analogous a back-end loaded two-tier offer. Thefront-end is composed of the higher priced IPO shares. The back-end iscomposed of the lower priced aftermarket shares. Because rational, fullyinformed investors have no incentive to participate in the front-end ofsuch offers, back-end loaded two-tier offers cannot succeed in marketscomposed of rational, fully informed investors. One possible explanation for the successful marketing of closed-end fundIPOs is that fully informed investors believe    that each new fund issufficiently different from its predecessors that it will not trade toa discount even though its predecessors have. This explanation, which relieson the systematic triumph of hope over experience, seems sufficiently implausiblethat it can readily be dismissed as an explanation of the behavior of fullyinformed, rational investors.A second and probably more accurate explanation for the successful initialpublic offering of closed-end domestic equity funds relies on the observationthat investors can be divided into two categories that, for want of a betterlabel, can be called ``smart enough'' and ``not smart enough.'' \8\<NOTE/> Investors who are ``smart enough'' know that initial publicofferings of closed-end domestic equity funds quickly trade to a discount.These investors never purchase in the IPO. Investors who are ``not smartenough'' are unaware of the prevalence of closed-end fund discounts and,unless specifically warned, can be persuaded to purchase shares of a closed-endequity fund in an initial public offering. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The finance literature contains several examples of modelsin which some investors are better informed than others. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Black, Noise, 41 J. Fin. 529 (1986); De Long, Shleifer,Summers andamp; Waldmann, The Size and Incidence of the Losses From NoiseTrading, 44 J. Fin. 681 (1989).It should be emphasized that investors who, for purposes of this analysis,fall into the ``not smart enough'' category can be extraordinarily intelligent,indeed, brilliant in other endeavors. For example, a professor of engineeringwho is well  versed in the solution of partial differential equations thatare far beyond the comprehension of the average stockbroker can be totallyoblivious of the empirical evidence that closed-end domestic equity fundIPOs quickly trade to a discount. Life is complicated and nobody can knoweverything. In this context, an IPO of an equity fund can succeed if investors whoare ``not smart enough'' can be persuaded to purchase all the shares offeredin the IPO. Indeed, compounding this problem is the fact that brokers whosell closed-end domestic equity fund shares earn greater compensation thanbrokers who sell the same number of fund shares in the aftermarket.\9\<NOTE/> If a broker is willing to put his interest in commissionincome ahead of his client's best financial interests, then such a brokermight recommend a closed-end IPO purchase to a client who is ``not smartenough.'' Such agency problems are hardly rare in our modern economy.\10\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ ``Fund specialists say brokers can make $200 on a typical$10,000 closed-end offering, compared with $75 for a similar fund alreadytrading in the secondary market.'' Caution Urged for Closed-End Fund Investors,Wall St. J., March 22, 1988, at 37. See also Burnt Offerings: Closed-EndFunds Bring No Blessings to Shareholders, Barrons, Aug. 10, 1987, at 6-7,32-26. <ITAG tagnum="28">Because a broker's income is higher if he sells a fund's shares inthe IPO than in the aftermarket, viewed from the broker's selfish perspective,an IPO of a closed-end domestic equity fund is a front-end loaded two-tiertransaction. A rational, self-interested broker thus has every incentiveto suggest that his clients invest in a closed-end domestic equity fundIPO unless the broker fears the adverse consequences that may follow whenthe clients complain that the fund is trading at a discount.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ An agency problem arises whenever a person (a principal)hires someone else (an agent) to make a decision and the agent's incentivesdiffer from the principal's. In this case, the agency problem arises, inpart, because the closed-end domestic equity fund IPO is back-end loadedfrom the investor's (principal's) perspective and front-end loaded fromthe brokers (agent's) perspective. <T3>See </T3>generally Jensen andamp; Meckling, The Theory of the Firm: ManagerialBehavior Agency Costs and Ownership Structure, 3 J. Fin. Econ. 305 (1976);Ross, The Economic Theory of Agency: The Principal's Problem, 63 Amer.Econ. Rev. 134 (1973); Spence andamp; Zeckhauser, Insurance, Information,and Individual Action, 61 Amer. Econ. Rev. 119 (1971).  Interestingly, the available data tend to support a characterization ofthe closed-end IPO market as one characterized by a subpopulation of investorswho are ``not smart enough.'' It seems that institutional investors, whosefunds are typically managed by market professionals, tend to avoid closed-endfund IPOs.\11\<NOTE/> Thus, institutional investors may tend to be ``smart enough''to avoid closed-end domestic equity fund IPOs while the population of investorswho are ``not smart enough'' is drawn from the ranks of retail investors.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ OEA Study, at 23-25. Data from January 1988 through May 1989, a period subsequent to that studiedin the OEA Report, indicate a marked decline in the volume of closed-endfund IPOs. During that period, of the 77 closed-end funds offered in theU.S., 65 (84.4 percent) were bond funds, 7 (9.1 percent) were foreign stockfunds, and only 5   (6.5 percent) were domestic equity funds.\12\<NOTE/> The five domestic equity closed-end funds declined in valueby approximately 9.45 percent after 120 trading days. These data suggestthat the market may have learned that closed-end domestic equity fundstend not to be profitable IPO investments and that the number of thosefunds brought to market has therefore declined.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Office of the Chief Economist, Memorandum from KathleenWeiss to Kenneth Lehn and David Malmquist, Closed-End Fund Stud. Update,June 20, 1989 (copy placed in public file no. S7-21-89). This analysis raises some interesting questions about the conduct of brokerswho recommend closed-end domestic equity fund IPOs to their customers.Suppose a broker fails to explain to a customer that, rather than buyingshares in a closed-end domestic equity fund IPO, the investor would bebetter off buying shares of the same fund in the aftermarket. Is such afailure unobjectionable because the quantity and quality of the evidenceregarding discounts provides an insufficient basis for making such a recommendation?If so, how does the quantity and quality of the closed-end discount evidencecompare with information upon which brokers rely when making other recommendations?What quantity and quality evidence should then be required as a basis fora recommendation? Assuming that the evidence regarding discounts is credible, and recognizingthat not every broker can know every fact about every product he recommends,could a failure to advise a customer   to purchase in the aftermarket ratherthan in the IPO be supported on the basis that a broker could not reasonablybe expected to know about the prevalence of discounts? The argument insupport of this proposition must be that the level of skill and care expectedof a broker does not rise to the level at which a customer reasonably shouldexpect the broker to be aware of the substantial probability that the closed-endfund IPO shares will trade at a discount. If one accepts this argument,how knowledgeable should a customer expect a broker to be about specificinvestment recommendations made to that customer? How does this standardof care relate to the advice that brokers generally provide to clients?Put a bit differently, if brokers can legitimately rely on evidence ofpast positive performance of a category of securities as a basis for arecommendation in selling an IPO, to what extent should brokers be expectedto take into account equivalently credible evidence of past negative performanceof a category of securities before making such a recommendation? For example,consider a situation in which the evidence of the positive performancehistory of a category of securities is as powerful as the evidence regardingdiscounts following IPO closed-end domestic equity fund offerings. If brokersare permitted to rely on evidence of past positive performance should theybe expected to give equal weight to equally powerful evidence of past negativeperformance? Further, if it is correct that no rational, fully informed investor wouldpurchase closed-end domestic equity fund shares in an IPO, how can a brokerrecommend such a purchase? Is it because the broker is not sufficientlyinformed? Or, is it because the broker's incentive is different from thecustomer's and the logical choice from the broker's perspective is notthe logical choice from the customer's perspective? After all, the brokerearns substantially more by selling the shares in the IPO than by sellingthe same shares in the aftermarket. In that case, how does the broker'srecommendation benefit the customer? Does the presence of such a potentialconflict alter the degree of care that one expects the broker to exercisein connection with a recommendation? Does it alter the information thatthe broker should convey to his customer before making a recommendation?Does it alter the degree of confidence that retail customers should havein broker recommendations? Finally, how do these observations relate to the proposed requirement thatprospectuses contain cautionary legends about closed-end fund IPOs? Willsuch a legend change broker behavior in recommending closed-end fund IPOs?Should such a legend change broker behavior in recommending closed-endfund IPOs?<ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix A </ITAG>Set forth below is a cross-reference sheet listing each item and certainsub-items of proposed Form N-2 and a cross-reference to the item or sub-itemof current Form N-2 (``N-2''), Form N-1A (``N-1A''), Form N-3 (``N-3''),or Regulation S-K (``S-K'') from which the proposed item was derived.

If the registrant expectsthe investment period to exceed three months, the reasons for the expecteddelay should be stated. It is the view of the Division of Investment Management(``Division'') that an investment company which takes in excess of sixmonths to invest net proceeds will not be operating in accordance withits investment objectives and policies as disclosed in its registrationstatement. Freedom of action to take in excess of six months is consideredby the Division to be prohibited by sections 8(b)(1) and 13(a) of the InvestmentCompany Act of 1940 (``1940 Act'') (15 U.S.C. 80a-8(b)(1), 80a-13(a)),and the registrant would be required to seek its shareholders' consentto a change of investment objectives if after six months it had not investednet proceeds in accordance with its investment objectives. In the caseof an initial public offering of a business development company (``BDC''),the Division is of the view that section 58 of the 1940 Act (15 U.S.C.80a-57) requires that 65% of the registrant's assets should be investedin the types of securities designed to meet its stated investment objectivewithin two years after commencement of the offering. The Division willnot consider a registrant to be invested in accordance with the applicablerequirements if it is invested in money market instruments or other securitieswhich do not conform with the registrant's stated investment objectiveand policies.  Guide 2_Issuer Repurchase of Shares Issuer repurchases of shares in the secondary market or through tenderoffers (collectively ``share repurchases'') are limited by section 23 ofthe 1940 Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-23) and rule 23c-1 thereunder (17 CFR 270.23c-1)and are subject to sections 10(b), 13(e), and 14(e) (15 U.S.C. 78j(b),78m(e), and 78n(e)) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``1934 Act'')and the rules thereunder, particularly (i) rule 10b-5 (17 CFR 240.10b-5);(ii) rule 10b-13 (17 CFR 240.10b-13) (with respect to tender offers); (iii)rule 10b-18 (17 CFR 240.10b-18), rule 13e-1 (17 CFR 240.13e-1), and rule13e-3 (17 CFR 240.13e-3) (with respect to the types of share repurchasesspecified in those rules); and (iv) rule 13e-4 (17 CFR 240.13e-4) and regulation14E (17 CFR 240.14e-1 <T3>et seq.</T3>) (in the case of tender offers). Registrants are urgedto raise any questions with respect to the applicability of provisionsof the 1934 Act and the rules thereunder and related disclosure issueswith the staffs of the Office of Trading Practices of the Division of MarketRegulation and the Office of Tender Offers of the Division of CorporationFinance prior to commencing any share repurchases, whether by secondarymarket purchases or through tender offers. In response to Item 8(f), registrants contemplating making share repurchasesshould disclose the expected timing of and procedures associated with suchrepurchases, including, in the case of a tender offer, when the purchaseprice will be determined and how shareholders may readily ascertain thenet asset value per share during the period that the tender offer is open.\1\<NOTE/> If tender offers are contemplated, the prospectus shoulddisclose that, if a tender offer is made, notice will be provided describingthe tender offer and that the notice will contain information shareholdersshould consider in deciding whether or not to tender their shares and detailedinstructions on how to tender shares.\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The price at which a registrant may purchase its sharesin a tender offer may be (and usually is) expressed in terms of its netasset value at the close of business on the day the offer ends. Thus, thenet asset value of a registrant's shares during a tender offer will bematerial information to investors in determining whether or not to tendershares. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Rule 13e-4(f)(8)(i) (17 CFR 240.13e-4(f)(8)(i)) requiresa tender offer to be open to all security holders of the class of securitiessubject to the tender offer. Therefore, no record dates may be specifiedwith respect to the eligibility of a shareholder to participate in anytender offer that may be made, since all shareholders must be able to participatein the offer until the close of the offering period. In addition, rule13e-4(f)(8)(ii) (17 CFR 240.13e-4(f)(8)(ii)) requires that the considerationpaid to any holder during the tender offer be the highest paid to any othersecurity holder during the tender offer. Therefore, deducting a servicefee from consideration paid to shareholders is not allowed because theeffect would be to lower the price paid to those shareholders tenderinga small amount of shares relative to the price paid to shareholders tenderinga large number of shares. The Division believes that a statement in the prospectus that the registrantwill make share repurchases for its shares may be inconsistent with thefiduciary duties of the board of directors of the registrant to consider,at the time of the transaction, the merits of the share repurchase andto determine that the share repurchase would be in the best interests ofthe registrant and registrant's shareholders based on the circumstancesat the time the repurchase is made. To avoid such a result, a registrantcontemplating repurchasing shares on a specified date in the future oron a regular (<T3>e.g., </T3>quarterly) or frequent basis should neither state nor implyin its prospectus that the repurchase will be automatic. Nor should theregistrant provide any assurance that share repurchases will reduce oreliminate the discount of its share's market price to net asset value.To avoid investors from drawing unwarranted inferences that there is anautomatic right to tender stock back to the registrant (in the case ofa tender offer), and to avoid any implication that the board of directorshave limited its discretion in determining whether or not to proceed witha share repurchase based upon conditions at the time of the repurchaseand the best interests of the registrant and its shareholders, a registrantshould prominently disclose in the prospectus that the board of directorswill consider making share repurchases (or tender offers), and the factorsthat the Board will consider, including how frequently the board will considermaking repurchases. In addition, while the disclosure need not be as detailedas that which would appear in an offer to purchase delivered to shareholdersin connection with a tender offer, it should disclose the types of factorsthat would preclude a share repurchase. The means by which share repurchases will be funded generally would bematerial and thus these means and any risks inherent in the policies relatingto funding should be disclosed. Therefore, if the registrant intends toincur debt to finance a share repurchase, the registrant should disclosethe maximum amount of debt that may be incurred for that purpose, the restrictionsimposed by the 1940 Act on leverage, and the attendant risks of leveraging.\3\<NOTE/> In addition, the registrant should discuss the effect thatshare repurchases and related financings might have on expense ratios;portfolio turnover; and on the ability of the registrant to achieve itsinvestment objectives. The ability of the registrant to qualify as a regulatedinvestment company under the Internal Revenue Code (or the extent to whichthe registrant's Board will consider such risk in deciding to proceed witha share repurchase which will be funded through the liquidation of portfoliosecurities) should also be discussed. Finally, registrants should discussthe potential tax consequences to investors and the registrant of sharerepurchases in response to items 10(d) or 22, as appropriate.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See </T3>section 18 of the 1940 Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-18) and Guide 6to Form N-2. Guide 6 contains a detailed discussion of the Division's viewson the risks associated with leverage.Occasionally, a registrant may wish to make an ``odd-lot'' tender offer(<T3>i.e., </T3>an offer to purchase all of the shares held by shareholderswho hold less than 100 shares) in order to reduce its administrative costsand give small shareholders an opportunity to sell shares without brokeragecosts. The Division is of the view that an ``odd-lot'' tender offer ispermitted under rule 23c-1 \4\<NOTE/> if it complies with the conditions set forth in that ruleand the applicable provisions of, and the rules and regulations under,the 1934 Act, including rule 13e-4(g)(5) (17 CFR 240.13e-4(g)(5)), whichspecifically permits odd-lot tenders. The Division is of the view thatpurchases made in accordance with the applicable rules would not violaterule 23c-1(a)(9), which requires that repurchases made in reliance on rule23c-1 not be made in a manner or on a basis which discriminates unfairlyagainst any holders of the class of securities purchased. The Divisionbelieves that holders who tender their shares in odd-lot tender offersare treated fairly because they are given the opportunity to sell theirshares at the lesser of the fund shares' market price or net asset value\5\<NOTE/> without incurring the high brokerage costs usually associatedwith odd-lot transactions. The registrant's remaining shareholders arebenefitted because the elimination of odd-lot holders usually results ina reduction in the registrant's administrative expenses. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Section 23(c)(2) of the 1940 Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-23(c)(2))is not applicable to odd-lot tender offers because they are not made toall holders of the class of securities to be purchased. Section 23(c)(3)(15 U.S.C. 80a-23(c)(3)) authorizes the Commission to permit repurchaseseither by issuing a rule or by order upon application. Pursuant to thatsection, the Commission has adopted rule 23c-1, which permits a closed-endfund to repurchase its securities subject to the conditions in that rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Rule 23c-1(a)(6) (17 CFR 270.23c-1(a)(6)). As noted above, odd-lot tender offers are subject to the anti-fraud provisionsof the 1934 Act, and a registrant making such an offer has the responsibilityto make adequate disclosure of materially pertinent information in connectionwith such tender offers, including the reasons for making the offer, theterms and conditions of the offer, tax consequences to tendering shareholders,and any significant developments in the affairs of the registrant sinceits most recent report to shareholders. Guide 3_Change of Control Provisions in the Registrant's Charter or By-lawsIf the registrant has any provisions in its charter or by-laws that wouldhave an effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control(such as super-majority voting requirements on matters related to merger,consolidation, sale of assets or liquidation, or classification of directorswith staggered terms of office), a description of these provisions shouldbe set forth in the prospectus in response to Item 10(a)(vi) and, if oneis otherwise required, in the synopsis. Each applicable provision shouldbe separately identified and its substance and effects discussed. The following information about such provisions should be discussed inresponse to Item 10(a)(vi): (1) The rationale for adopting these provisions;(2) the positive and negative effects of these provisions (such as theeffect of depriving shareholders of an opportunity of selling their sharesat a premium over prevailing market price); (3) whether the voting requirementsto change the nature of the company's business, approve extraordinary corporatetransactions, convert to an open-end investment company, or remove directorsare higher than those imposed by federal or state law; and (4) whetherthe board of directors or trustees have considered the provisions and determinedthat they are in the best interest of shareholders.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ In addition, <T3>see </T3>Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Release No. 15230 (October13, 1978) (43 FR 49863 (Oct. 25, 1978)) which discusses disclosure requirementsfor proxy and information statements containing anti-takeover and similarproposals. Guide 4_Conversion to an Open End Company Some closed-end investment company prospectuses disclose that the boardof directors of the registrant will consider converting the company toan open-end fund after a specified period of time. Because shares of anopen-end company are sold and redeemed at net asset value, the prospectof a conversion is often intended to reduce the discount to net asset valueof the registrant's share price. If conversion to an open-end company isdisclosed as a possible course of action in the prospectus, the prospectusshould discuss the factors which the registrant's board of directors willconsider in determining whether to propose a conversion. The requisiteshareholder vote to effect a conversion should also be disclosed. An investment in an open-end company raises risks for investors that aredifferent from an investment in a closed-end company, and these risks shouldbe discussed in a prospectus which raises the possibility of conversionto an open-end company. For example, because a shareholder of an open-endinvestment company may present his shares for redemption any time, andpayment must be made within seven days of presentation at their net assetvalue, conversion to open-end status may require changes in how the registrant'sportfolio is managed in order to meet the liquidity requirements applicableto open-end funds. Because portfolio securities may have to be liquidatedto meet redemptions, this could affect the registrant's ability to meetits investment objective or use investment policies and techniques thatare more appropriate for a fixed portfolio rather than one subject to constantdemands for redemption and inflows of cash. The registrant also should disclose whether it contemplates charging salesor redemption fees upon conversion to an open-end fund and whether redemptionswill be made in cash or securities. If the registrant, after conversion,intends to retain the option of meeting redemptions with portfolio securities,the costs and risks imposed on the redeeming shareholders of receivingsuch securities also should be discussed. Guide 5_Dividend Reinvestment Plans Item 10(a)(v) of Form N-2 requires the registrant to describe any dividendreinvestment plan available to shareholders. It is the position of theCommission staff that securities issued by a registrant in connection witha plan are not required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933(``1933 Act'') if there is no ``sale for value'' within the meaning ofsection 2(3) of the 1933 Act (15 U.S.C. 77b(3)).\7\<NOTE/> As a general matter, no sale for value would occur when ashareholder elects, before the declaration of a dividend, to receive adividend in stock in lieu of cash, no sales load is deducted upon issuanceof the additional shares,\8\<NOTE/> and the shareholder provides no consideration (besides theforegone cash dividend) for the additional securities. In the case of adividend reinvestment plan that provides for the purchase of shares foradditional consideration (``cash purchase plan''), a sale by an issuerwould not be deemed to occur where: (a) The securities are purchased inthe secondary market on behalf of the plan participant by an agent notaffiliated with the registrant, its adviser, or underwriter; and (b) theregistrants' participation in the plan is limited to administrative functionssuch as bookkeeping.\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Securities Act Rel.

Registrants should note that the issuance of sharesin connection with a dividend reinvestment plan is restricted by Section23(b) of the 1940 Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-23(b)) which prohibits closed-endinvestment companies from issuing shares at a price below net asset value.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Investment Company Act Rel.

See also</T3> Lucky Stores (pub. avail. July 6, 1974). Guide 6_Leverageand Senior Securities Section 18 of the 1940 Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-18) imposes restrictions on aclosed-end investment company's capital structure. Under section 18(c)(15 U.S.C. 80a-18(c)), a closed-end investment company may issue only oneclass of senior securities representing indebtedness and one class of seniorsecurities representing preferred stock. Section 18(a)(1) (15 U.S.C. 80a-18(a)(1))requires a company that offers senior stock or senior debt securities tomaintain a 200% and 300% net asset coverage, respectively, immediatelyfollowing the offering and on an ongoing basis as a condition to declaringdividends or distributions. A registrant that uses a leveraged capital structure creates additionalinvestment risks for its shareholders. Where a registrant uses or has reservedthe authority to create a leveraged capital structure by issuing seniorsecurities, cross reference to the discussion of these risks should beincluded on the cover page of the prospectus as required by Item 1(a)(x).The following factors could increase investment risk and the volatilityof the price of the registrant's shares and should be discussed in theprospectus: (1) That leveraging exaggerates any increase or decrease inthe value of the registrant's portfolio; (2) that the costs of borrowingmay exceed the income from the portfolio securities purchased with theborrowed money; (3) the decline in net asset value if the investment performanceof the additional securities purchased fails to cover their cost (includingany interest paid on the money borrowed or dividend requirements of preferredstock) to the registrant (including the effect on common stock dividendpayments); (4) that a failure to pay dividends or make distributions couldresult in the registrant ceasing to qualify as a regulated investment companyunder the Internal Revenue Code; and (5) that if the asset coverage forpreferred stock or debt securities declines to less than 200% or 300%,respectively (as a result of market fluctuations or otherwise), the registrantmay be required to sell a portion of its investments when it may be disadvantageousto do so. Special risks also are created where the registrant issues short-term debtor auction rate preferred stock to fund the purchase of long-term debtor fixed income securities (``borrowing short and lending long''). Theregistrant should discuss the consequences to holders of its senior securitiesand equity securities, respectively, of fluctuations in short-term andlong-term rates and the effect on these securities if short-term ratesexceed long-term rates. Where the registrant is offering debt or buying securities on margin,\10\<NOTE/> disclosure also should include a discussion of whether theregistrant's assets will be used as security for the borrowings or whetherthe borrowings will be unsecured. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Section 12(a)(1) of the 1940 Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-12(a)(1))limits margin transactions to such short-term credits as are necessaryfor the clearance of transactions. If the senior securities are to be issued with a specified rating by arating agency (such as Standard andamp; Poor's), the risk disclosure in theprospectus required by Item 8(c) of Form N-2 should make it clear thatthe rating does not eliminate or mitigate the risks of investing in theRegistrant's securities. The prospectus should describe the effects oneach class of the registrant's securities if the rating is lowered or withdrawnand the relationship of the ratings on senior securities to the investmentquality of the securities in which the registrant will invest. The prospectus should describe the financial impact on common shareholdersof the issuance of senior securities, including the impact of the costsrelated to such issuances (<T3>e.g.,</T3> that the underwriting commissions, offering expenses, ratingagency fees and organization expenses will be borne by the holders of thecommon shares) and the effects of dividend and interest requirements ondistributions to common shareholders. Registrants should provide a concise explanation of the asset coveragetests required by section 18 of the 1940 Act and their effects, particularlywhere two classes of senior securities are, or might be, issued. Registrantsshould ccnsider providing simplified numerical examples to illustrate howthe asset coverage tests will operate. Section 18(i) of the 1940 Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-18(i)) requires that preferredshareholders have voting rights and have equal voting rights with otheroutstanding voting stocks, except as provided by section 18(a) (15 U.S.C.80a-18(a)) or otherwise required by law. Section 18(a) gives the holdersof a class of senior securities the right to elect directors in the eventspecified asset coverage tests are not met or dividends are not paid. Suchvoting rights should be described in the prospectus. Guide 7_Synopsis Guide 33 to Form N-1A sets forth the Division's views as to the appropriatecontent of a synopsis. A synopsis included in a prospectus of a closed-endfund should include the items specified in that Guide, and: (i) A briefdescription of the principal trading market for the registrant's securities;if none, so state; (ii) the principal speculative or risk factors peculiarto the registrant, if any; and (iii) a summary of the plan of distributionfor the registrant's securities, including a concise description of anysubscription agreement or escrow arrangements. Guide 8_Continuous Offerings Closed-end companies offering securities on a best efforts basis may havecontinuous offering periods that extend beyond 30 days. Such offeringsmay be made in accordance with rule 415 under the 1933 Act (17 CFR 230.415).Rule 415 imposes certain conditions on continuous offerings, includinga requirement that the registrant provide an undertaking to file post-effectiveamendments in the event of the occurrence of any events which ``representa fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement* * *.'' <T3>See </T3>Item 33(d) of Form N-2. A fundamental change will have occurredwhere the registrant has made a material acquisition or a series of acquisitionsthat are in the aggregate material, or the consummation of these acquisitionsbecome probable. Where a closed-end fund has structured a continuous offeringinvolving a series of closings (with each closing being held at such timeas subscription thresholds are met), sales of fund securities must be stoppedfrom the time that a fundamental change in the affairs of the registrantbecomes probable until a post-effective amendment describing the changebecomes effective. In addition, registrants using multiple closings mustcomply with the 1940 Act's requirement's on pricing of securities. Seesections 23(b) and 63(2)(A) (with respect to business development companies)of the 1940 Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-23(b) and 80a-62(2)(A)). Registrants conducting continuous offerings are precluded from making anyshare repurchases, whether in the secondary market or by means of a tenderoffer, under rule 10b-6 under the Securities Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10b-6),absent an exception to or exemption from that rule. Registrants are urgedto contact the Office of Trading Practices of the Division of Market Regulationconcerning any question regarding rule 10b-6. Guide 9_Foreign Securities A registrant that intends to invest 10 percent or more of its assets inforeign securities that are not publicly traded in the United States shouldconcisely address in the prospectus where applicable, the risks associatedwith: (1) Currency fluctuations; (2) restrictions on, and cost associatedwith, the exchange of currencies; (3) the difficulty in obtaining or enforcinga court judgment abroad; (4) reduced levels of publicly available informationconcerning issuers; (5) restrictions on foreign investment in other jurisdictions;(6) reduced levels of governmental regulation of foreign securities markets;(7) difficulties in effecting the repatriation of capital invested abroad;(8) difficulties in transaction settlements and the effect of this delayon shareholder equity; (9) foreign withholding taxes; (10) political, economic,and similar risks, including expropriation and nationalization; (11) differentaccounting, auditing, and financial standards; (12) price volatility; and(13) reduced liquidity in the markets in which the fund will invest. Inresponse to Items 20 (f) and (g), the Statement of Additional Informationof any fund which invests more than 10 percent of its assets in foreignsecurities should discuss custodial arrangements for foreign securities.In response to Items 9(a)(ii) (A) and (D), the prospectus should also providea basis for an investor to assess the expertise and experience of the fund'sinvestment adviser (and any person making a significant contribution tothe investment advice provided to the registrant), with respect to theforeign markets in which the fund will invest and, in the case of a foreignadviser, the adviser's knowledge of regulatory requirements of the UnitedStates securities laws should be indicated. In the case of a ``country fund,'' or a fund that invests substantiallyall of its assets in securities of issuers organized under the laws ofa single foreign country or region, the prospectus should address the following:(1) Restrictions placed by the foreign jurisdiction on foreign investment,including the material terms and conditions imposed on the fund by anystatutes, regulations or orders relating to its investing activities; (2)restrictions or prohibitions placed on foreign investment in any majorindustry or market sector, such as the defense industry, energy or transportation;(3) restrictions placed on the total amount or type of securities in anysingle issuer that may be held by a foreign investor; and (4) any otherrestrictions of the foreign jurisdiction that would operate to limit theability of the registrant to implement its investment policies or to operatein the manner described in its prospectus and SAI. The registrant alsoshould discuss political and economic conditions, economic forecasts bygovernment officials if available, capitalization, volume of trading andunusual characteristics of the securities markets of the jurisdiction,and the regulation of the foreign securities markets in which it intendsto invest. Registrants using a foreign custodian should comply with the provisionsof rule 17f-5 under the Investment Company Act.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-18516 Filed 8-10-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 8010-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
