In supporting a homeless man's use of theMorristown Public Library, she states:   &quot;Not so long ago, public places excluded African-Americansand other minorities from their confines. The ACLU isinvolved in the library case to ensure that a new class ofpersecuted people, the homeless, are not excluded from publicplaces. . . .&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The homeless are not excluded from libraries because theyare homeless but rather because they disturb others, who usethe libraries for reading/studying/browsing/researching,which is the reason libraries exist. Libraries are not parksnor shelters.   In contrast, black people were excluded from publicschools not because they lacked hygiene or were disruptive,but because of race. Even in a segregated all-white school, adisruptive or unhygienic white student would be asked toleave.   The problem in Morristown was not civil rights in thelibrary, but rather how to provide help for the homeless. Touse civil-rights litigation to solve the homeless problem isto trivialize civil rights. Ultimately, hard cases make forbad law, and a bad law tends to undermine public confidencein civil liberties.   James N. Rudolph   New York   ---   Ms. Zucker is dead wrong when she implies that publiclibraries are trying to exclude &quot;a new class of persecutedpeople, the homeless.&quot; There are homeless people who uselibraries day in and day out without any problem.   Libraries are trying to cope with &quot;homed&quot; as well ashomeless people who exhibit grossly offensive andinappropriate behavior. Some have overpowering body odors orstare at other people for great lengths of time or followchildren and other visitors around the library; this andsimilar behavior make library users wary.   It's because librarians want to have the greatest numberpossible engage in &quot;constitutionally protected activities&quot; --reading and researching -- that anti-social activities arediscouraged. The ACLU would make it impossible for areasonable person to make a judgment on anti-social behavior.   If because of the ACLU many local residents arediscouraged from going to the library themselves or sendingtheir children there, the library will lose taxpayer supportand wither away. So much for the &quot;constitutionally protectedactivities&quot; of the general public.   Marvin H. Scilken   Director   Orange Public Library   Orange, N.J.</TEXT></DOC>
