Lawmakers had hoped their third day of debate on the legislationwould be the last as they sorted through amendments to a ``direemergency'' measure President Bush first proposed in March.   But they bogged down over an amendment offered by Sen. JohnMcCain, R-Ariz., to delay some of the new catastrophic careprovisions for the elderly under Medicare, including the surtax onpeople more than 65 years old designed to pay for the program. Somesenior citizens have complained about the tax, which can reach amaximum of $800 for the wealthiest of them.   Democrats said catastrophic care changes should be made inseparate legislation, and work on the bill was scheduled to continueWednesday.   The Senate rejected 69-29 an amendment by Sen. Jesse Helms,R-N.C., allowing the Transportation Department to block aid tocommunities refusing to give work on public transit projects tocompanies that conduct business with the pro-apartheid regime ofSouth Africa.   It also adopted by voice vote a provision by Senate MajorityLeader George Mitchell, D-Maine, calling on Congress to rework a taxlaw business considers burdensome.   That followed a 50-49 defeat for Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., whoinstead wanted the Senate to repeal the tax law, which forcescompanies to prove their health benefits are as generous to low-paidworkers as they are to executives. For procedural reasons, Kastenwould have needed 60 votes to prevail.   Kasten called the provision ``unwise, unworkable and just plainunfair.'' Democrats agreed that the tax law needs revamping, butsaid revoking it would be a mistake.   ``Is there any reason we should be favoring management?'' askedSenate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas.   The legislation is aimed at providing extra money for the rest offiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30. It contains $1.2 billion forveterans programs, $892 million for student loans, $342 million forthe costs of last summer's Western forest fires, and money forefforts including foster care, refugees, the United Nations, andfood stamps.   It also bestows federal money on a host of projects of a lesssweeping nature, but championed by various legislators for localconsumption.   Thus, it contains $75 million to rebuild a 26-year-old WestVirginia radio telescope that collapsed last November, sought bySenate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.   Thanks to Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., $275,000 wouldbe set aside for Kansas State University to advise farmers on copingwith drought. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, garnered $500,000 forengineering work on a lake in Cincinnati that has filled withsediment. Wyoming's two GOP senators, Malcolm Wallop and AlanSimpson, got $400,000 for a study of last summer's fires atYellowstone National Park.   In a boon to senators from 39 states, the measure also supplies$6.6 million to continue subsidizing air carriers serving smallcommunities.   The legislation also carries provisions stating the Senate'sviews on an assortment of topics.   The chamber wants the Agriculture Department to buy more applesfor the federal school lunch program to help the country's ailingapple industry, thanks to Washington state's two senators, DemocratBrock Adams and Republican Slade Gorton.   It wants the Department of Health and Human Services to hire moreemployees in Honolulu, in the home state of Appropriations Committeemember Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii.   And it doesn't want Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to beable to name a new administrator of the Panama Canal Commission,which by treaty Panama's leader is entitled to do.   One thing the bill does not have is $822 million for variousanti-drug programs contained in the $3.7 billion version of thelegislation the House passed last month. That discrepancy and otherswill have to be worked out by negotiators before the bill can besent to the White House for Bush's signature.   Bush, citing the federal deficit, has threatened to veto themeasure if it has any money for drug programs. The measure Bushinitially proposed was for $2.2 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
