(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Actor Paul Newman denied Thursday thathe ever promised stock from his food companies to a delicatessenowner, and said his so-called salad-dressing trial was ``longerthan the Academy Awards.''   Newman and his charity food companies, Newman's Own Inc. andSalad King Inc., are being sued by Julius Gold, who claims he waspromised stock for services in helping to launch the companieseight years ago.   Newman, asked to relate how the companies had developed,testified that sales were promising when he launched them back in1982 but there was no guarantee they would succeed.   ``I've had films open promising and go right through thefloor,'' the Academy Award-winning actor said. ``And on the otherhand, I've had some pictures that started out very badly and becamesuccessful. The most embarrassing thing is the salad dressing isout-grossing my films.''   Salad King and Newman's Own, which make salad dressing,spaghetti sauce, popcorn and lemonade, reaped $42 million in saleslast year. All $28 million in profits since 1982 have gone tocharity.   Newman denied promising stock in the company to Gold or anyoneelse. He also denied ever having any conversations with Gold aboutgiving him stock.   ``This is getting longer than the Academy Awards here'' Newmansaid when asked to give some background about how the businessbegan.   ``It started off as a lark,'' Newman said. ``I did not expect itto go any place.''   Earlier Thursday, Newman's corporate lawyer, Leo Nevas,reasserted on the stand that he did not promise 8 percent of thecompanies' stock to Gold, who brought suit in Bridgeport SuperiorCourt against the actor, his business partner A.E. Hotchner and thecompanies.   Nevas said he recalled discussion at a meeting about Newmanholding two-thirds of the company stock and some shares possiblydistributed to others. But the lawyer said he had no authority topromise 8 percent to Gold.   Newman and Hotchner formed Salad King in 1982 on a whim to sellthe dressing Newman had been making for friends in the basement ofhis Westport home. The two branched into spaghetti sauce thefollowing year.   Gold, a Westport deli owner, says Hotchner contacted him forhelp in distributing the dressing, beginning three years ofinvolvement in the project. He also says Nevas promised him 8percent of the stock.   Newman's lawyers deny any such deal. They have tried to minimizeGold's dealings in the venture, saying he tried to thrust himselfon the project and invited himself to meetings.   The tiny courtroom, which seats only 30, was full again Thursdaywith media and spectators. Television crews manned cameras outsidethe courthouse to film Newman during breaks.   It is the second time the case has gone to trial. The firstended in a mistrial in June 1988 after the jury mistakenly sawdepositions not admitted as evidence.</TEXT></DOC>
