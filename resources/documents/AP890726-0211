(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man already accused of killing a NewMexico store clerk was charged Wednesday with the shooting death oftwo convenience store clerks in his hometown.   Gregg Francis Braun is also a suspect in a similar slaying inArdmore, Okla., and prosecutors there announced Wednesday they haddismissed a first-degree murder charge filed against another man inthat case. The charge against Michael Frank Greene was dropped inpart because evidence turned up that he could not physically havebeen at the shooting scene last week.   Braun, 28, son of a Garden City lawyer and brother of the ElligCounty attorney, is a suspect in the Oklahoma slaying as well asthe killing of another store clerks Texas. Greene also has beencharged in the Texas killing.   Braun was charged Wednesday in the July 19 shooting deaths oftwo women who were abducted from separate stores in Garden City andshot in the head. Their bodies were dumped three miles apart northof the city in southwestsern Kansas.   Braun, arraigned Monday on a charge of murder in Sunday'sshooting death of a store clerk in Springer, N.M., was charged inKansas with two counts of murder, aggravated robbery and aggravatedkidnapping.   He was being held in New Mexico on a $1 million bond. Kansasauthorities also set his bond at $1 million.   Police also describe Braun a suspect in the July 20 shootingdeath of a man at a photo processing shop in Pampa, Texas, and theJuly 21 slaying of a clerk in a flower shop at Ardmore, Okla.   Greene, 37, of Inola, Okla., and Braun are described as verysimilar in appearance. ``They could almost pass for brothers,''Garden City Police Capt. Stan Wojdylak said.   District Attorney Fred Collins in Ardmore said he was dismissingthe charges against Greene without prejudice, meaning they could berefiled at a later time if prosecutors feel they should reopen thecase against Greene.   Collins cited the preliminary ballistics and fingerprint testsas well as evidence that Greene had been in a Wichita Falls, Texas,hospital Friday as reasons for dismissing the charges. He said itwas physically impossible for Greene to have been in Ardmore at thetime of the shootings.   Collins said he is waiting for the final fingerprint andballistics tests before considering charges against Braun.   Asked Wednesday after charges were filed against Braun if Greenewas still a suspect, Wojdylak said only that ``the scope of theinvestigation is not limited to Mr. Braun.'' He said otherpossibilities have not been ruled out.   The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle-Beacon reported Wednesday thatemployees of the Grain Bin, a Garden City nightclub, knew bothGreene and Braun, but that there was no immediate indication thetwo men knew each other.   Braun had been a maintenance worker at the S-Bar Ranch Feed Yardnear Garden City. Feed Yard manager Galen Wright said Braun came towork the day after the Garden City slayings, picked up his paycheckand said he wouldn't be back.   Greene had been staying this month at the Wheat Lands Motor Innin Garden City but left without paying a $295 bill, motel officialssaid.   Motel officials said they moved his belongings out of his roomJuly 17, two days before the Garden City killings.   All five victims were believed to have been shot with a.25-caliber weapon, and New Mexico authorities found a .25-caliberhandgun in Braun's car when he was arrested Monday. The killings inKansas, Oklahoma and Texas were believed to have been carried outwith the same weapon.   Ballistics tests have been completed, but New Mexico authoritiessaid they would not release results until Braun appears in courtnext month.   Wojdylak said evidence gathered by officers in Kansas, Oklahomaand New Mexico resulted in the arrest warrant associated with theGarden City charges.   He would not describe the evidence, but search warrants returnedto Finney County District Court showed that blood-stained jeans anda shirt were recovered from Braun's Garden City house Monday.   The warrant on file Wednesday indicated authorities were alsolooking for women's clothing, a .25-caliber weapon or ammunition,cash and coin trays and an identification badge from one of theGarden City stores.</TEXT></DOC>
