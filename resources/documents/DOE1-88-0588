Two algorithms of computingM/sup E/(mod N) are proposed; the first one is based on the recodingtechnique that significantly reduces the total number of modular multiplications.The second one is a parallel algorithm that can be implemented by twoparallel processors and achieves optimal performance. In addition, aBrekille algorithm for modular multiplication was improved. It can beimplemented by a bit-serial-in and bit-serial-out systolic array. Thissystolic array can be used as the processing element of a proposed pipelinearchitecture of computing encryption and decryption of RSA schemes toachieve very high throughput. A Brent-Kung GCD algorithm was improvedso that it is twice as fast as the original one, and a correspondinginteger-extended GCD algorithm with the same time complexity is presented.A hardware design using borrow-save representation is developed to calculateboth GCD and extended GCD.</TEXT></DOC>
