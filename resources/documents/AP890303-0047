Abraham Ribicoff, D-Conn., on Thursday told the Housedefense appropriations subcommittee.   ``We collected a vast amount of data describing conditions atthousands of installations we were asked to review,'' said formerRep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala., in testimony before the correspondingSenate subcommittee. ``We did not just pluck this list out of thinair.''   Critics of the commission's recommendations, particularlylawmakers facing closings in their areas, have complained that thefindings are flawed.   Congress can block the closings only if both the House and Senatepass disapproval resolutions and lawmakers cannot pick and choseamong bases.   A vote on the plan is schedule within weeks.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Accused Man Goes To Paraguay</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Justice Department says a Philadelphia manfacing deportation following claims that he killed Jews during WorldWar II already has left the United States.
