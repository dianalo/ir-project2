The London market, known as Seaq, or Stock Exchange Automatic Quotation, also deals in shares from several nations. But the market could affect the Swiss exchanges, which are already suffering under sluggish volumes.    Seaq trading is geared to large institutional investors that prefer to trade large blocks of Swiss blue-chip shares. These transactions are sometimes difficult to place on the Swiss exchanges because liquidity is often too low.    Another advantage for big investors is that the Swiss stamp tax on securities transactions can be avoided by executing trades in London, although the Seaq market-makers at times may have to cover their trades by dealing in the Swiss market, thereby having to pay the transaction tax.    The tax angle adds ammunition to the levy's bitter opponents in Switzerland, who contend that the impost is driving business to foreign markets.    And the tax is a lucrative source of revenue for the government, bringing in more than 1 billion Swiss francs ($631 million) a year. Gilli Caflish, vice director of the tax divison in Swiss Finance Ministry, said his office will study the situation to assess the potential impact of Seaq on tax revenue.    Seaq's computerized system of two-way trading deals in 13 heavy-volume Swiss blue chips. So far, according to Karl Baumgartner, a vice president at Union Bank who tracks the major Swiss exchanges and London, Seaq appears to have little impact on Swiss market volume.    Martin Ekers, director of European trading at Warburg Securities in London, one of the five market-making firms in Swiss shares on Seaq, said he views Seaq as a complement to the Swiss exchanges because it generates more volume overall. Although the Swiss market will lose out on some business, he figures this will involve new, additional activity. In that sense, he said, Seaq doesn't pose a threat to the home market.    Richard T. Meier, chief executive of the Zurich Stock Exchange, tended to agree with this assessment, adding that new volume probably will be generated if more trades are made. He said little trading in Swiss shares is done abroad, and more overseas dealing seemed a natural evolution in globalization.    An important feature Seaq offers players is the volume data of Swiss shares traded on the exchange. The Swiss stock markets are working on a way to provide daily volume figures.    One of the lessons learned in the October 1987 stock market crash was that the Swiss stock exchanges couldn't provide the liquidity or the two-way trading to meet the needs of large institutions.    &quot;Foreign investors shun the Swiss exchange because they don't feel they can get out quickly enough,&quot; said Marc de Frisching, executive vice president and director at S.G. Warburg Soditic S.A. in Geneva. Soditic is 50%-owned by the British bank S.G. Warburg.    Added Hans Kaufmann, a financial analyst at Bank Julius Baer andamp; Co. in Zurich: &quot;One can't deny it, te Swiss market isn't as attractive to foreign investors anymore.&quot;    Mr. Kaufmann and other analysts say that the Swiss market's declining attractiveness stems in part from the stamp tax, insufficient supervision of financial markets and a lack of openness on the nation's main exchanges.    In addition, because of meager financial reporting requirements and the longstanding Swiss corporate practice of building up hidden reserves, investors have very little research to help them in making their stock picks, critics say.    ---   World Market Activity   Tokyo share prices bounced back in the afternoon Friday after the Nikkei index slipped through the 27000-level for the first time since Sept. 2, to close firmer in slow dealings.    The Nikkei index fell to a low on the day of around 26962 about 30 minutes into the afternoon session before bouncing back to close at 27258.27, up 85.93 points.    Traders said some bargain-hunting emerged after the Nikkei slipped below 27000, helping most sectors come off their lows, although broker and financial stocks in general were mostly left behind. Utilities and constructions were among the leaders.    The Tokyo market was closed Saturday according to the monthly schedule, and today is a Japanese national holiday.    London share prices closed higher in active trading as the major feature of the day was news of RTZ Corp.'s sale of its 28% holding in London andamp; Scottish Marine Oil.    However, dealers said, interest later dried up as the market paused to catch its breath and consolidate after advancing sharply over the course of the week.    Trading volume in Lasmo amounted to 113 million shares Friday, or a little less than 20% of the total shares traded on the exchange.    Dealers said news of the placing helped douse recent takeover speculation surrounding Lasmo, one of the few remaining U.K. independent oil producers. The wide placing of the RTZ shares among institutions makes Lasmo less vulnerable to a bid than if the RTZ holding had been sold to a single buyer, dealers added.    Lasmo shares ended 20 pence lower at 531 pence ($9). RTZ shares closed up 2 to 444 as 6.1 million shares changed hands.    Frankfurt share prices rallied to their highest levels of the year in unusually active Friday trading.    The DAX index advanced 7.73 points to close at 1269.36, its highest close in 1988. The index is 35.7% above this year's lowest level of 935.57, struck Jan. 29.    Brokers said news of an improvement in September U.S. jobless data was likely to boost the market again Monday. The U.S. said Friday that the unemployment rate sank 0.2 percentage point to 5.4% during the month.    Stock prices also closed higher in Stockholm and Zurich and were mixed in Milan, Amsterdam, Paris and Brussels.    Share prices closed higher in Hong Kong, Sydney, Singapore and Manila, were mixed in Wellington and lower in Taipei and Seoul.    Taipei shares continued to slide, pushing the key weighted index to its lowest level since Aug. 16. The plunge, affecting all eight sectors, was the market's eighth consecutive daily loss, in which the index has fallen 17.5%. Of 153 listings traded, 147 had maximum permissible losses of 3%.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                     % This                                 Oct 6     Oct 5      Year    U.S. ........................ 250.6     250.1   +  9.2    Britain ..................... 555.4     551.2   +  7.7    Canada ...................... 362.0     358.3   +  3.2    Japan ...................... 1253.8    1268.8   + 22.6    France ...................... 400.1     399.8   + 38.7    Germany ..................... 196.1     195.5   + 25.2    Hong Kong .................. 1804.1    1796.2   +  9.7    Switzerland ................. 164.7     163.9   + 17.1    Australia ................... 299.1     298.4   + 15.4    World index ................. 443.9     445.2   +  8.8</TEXT></DOC>
