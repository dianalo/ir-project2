Profits for Philippine banks rose 44% last year, on top ofgains of 40% the year before and 30% in 1988. The economy'sgrowth rate was stuck in the low single digits for the sameperiods.</LP><TEXT>   Bankers prefer to play down their performance and offervarious mitigating factors that they say reduce theirearnings. But analysts say the returns are undeniably ample,no matter how they are massaged, and reflect an industry longprotected by the government, tightly controlled by majorityshareholders, lacking real competition and closely linked tothe country's big family-held corporations.   Financial authorities, despite recent signs ofliberalization, have been slow to dismantle barriers toforeign entry and local expansion. Bankers, in turn, maintainpressure on the Central Bank of the Philippines and on oneanother to ensure that no one breaks ranks and mounts a trulycompetitive campaign.   &quot;Philippine commercial banks remain (profitable) thanks toan incurably oligopolistic structure,&quot; says an analyst with aforeign brokerage firm. &quot;In this country, the banker simplyalways wins.&quot;   But bankers say profit figures tell only part of thestory. &quot;If you look at it on that basis, (the bankingbusiness) looks healthy,&quot; says O.V. Espiritu, president ofFar East Bank andamp; Trust Co. and chairman of the BankersAssociation of the Philippines. But he says that ifinflation, reserve requirements and the depreciation of thepeso are taken into consideration, &quot;we didn't make anything.&quot;   It requires some pretty creative math to arrive at thatconclusion. Inflation was 15% in 1990, but far from losing inthe 24% depreciation of the peso in 1990, banks postedextraordinary year-end gains when the peso value of theirforeign-exchange holdings was recalculated. And, althoughreserve requirements are a lofty 25%, much of the money canbe invested in high-yielding Treasury bills.   Bankers may be modest because they don't want theirimpressive earnings compared with estimated real growth inthe gross domestic product of 2.1% last year, 5.8% in 1989and 6.4% in 1988. Bank profits also outpaced corporateearnings growth, which was about 17% for listed companieslast year. (GDP measures a nation's output of goods andservices, less foreign income.) Bankers also may be playingdown their bounty because they aren't likely to repeat lastyear's performance this year.   The Philippines has 31 commercial banks -- a relativelyhigh number for the size of the economy and perhaps too manyfor the industry to be an oligopoly. Yet the characterizationfits in many other ways. There is little real competition.Interest rates don't vary much, despite the fact that thebanks have autonomy in setting them. The enormous demand forcredit in the Philippines allows banks to maintain the widestspreads in Southeast Asia between what they pay on depositsand what they charge for loans -- a margin usually topping 10percentage points.   The nature of the industry also is reflected in its mostimportant business of financing the country's relatively fewlarge corporations -- a business that hinges on longrelationships with the families that own those companies.   Additional branches, more liberal rules governingautomated teller machines and new interest in investmentbanking may spark some competition in both retail andwholesale banking, but analysts warn against expecting much.And the big banks may just strengthen their positions byswallowing up smaller banks.   &quot;They're making a lot of money now. For them to be morecompetitive, they might lose some of their profit,&quot; says CoraP. Guidote, research manager for Peregrine SecuritiesPhilippines Inc., an arm of a Hong Kong merchant-bankingconcern.   Jose Cuisia Jr., governor of the Central Bank of thePhilippines, stresses that he is committed to making theindustry more competitive and to admitting more foreignbanks. But real movement to liberalize has been very slow;there are only four fully licensed foreign banks. Mr. Cuisiamay be able to persuade domestic bankers to agree not tooppose a few new foreign entries in the next year or two, butthere isn't likely to be any major deregulation, and the costof entry may be prohibitive.   &quot;The only thing that could really change (theuncompetitive banking industry) is the entry of foreignbanks,&quot; says Jose Salceda, senior investment analyst forBaring Securities (Philippines) Inc., an arm of a Britishmerchant bank. &quot;There are moves, but I don't think it will bepossible in the next five years.&quot;   The slow pace of banking reform is partly due to theoverall economy's narrow structure. Several dozen familiescontrol most major companies and industries, and banking isno exception, analysts say. Like most of the large companies,banks also are tightly held. Although about a third arelisted on the Manila stock market, only 70%-government-ownedPhilippine National Bank is widely traded.   Justo A. Ortiz, Philippine country executive forCitibank's investment bank, says he is disappointed at theslow pace of change, &quot;but the banking system can only changeas fast as the economy.&quot;   But there is also precious little incentive within theindustry to change, given the generous interest-rate marginsbanks enjoy. Savings rates, including small accounts and timedeposits, average about 11%, while the current prime lendingrate is 21%. About 70% of all accounts in the Philippineshave less than 5,000 pesos ($183), for which the rates areonly 5% to 6%. The margin between the average savings andprime rates reached 20 percentage points toward the end oflast year. The spread in Indonesia last year, for example,was only about 6.6 percentage points, analysts say, and themargin in other Southeast Asian countries was less than that.   Some critics charge that the banks act as a cartel insetting interest rates. Bankers dismiss the claim, but theyconcede that a few of the largest banks act as industryleaders, and the other banks find it more lucrative to fallin line behind them.   &quot;Banks call each other up to see what (the other banks)feel,&quot; concedes one banker, who declined to be identified.&quot;There's no smoke-filled rooms.&quot;   The top five banks -- Philippine National Bank, Bank ofthe Philippine Islands, Metrobank, Far East Bank andamp; Trust andPhilippine Commercial International Bank control about 45% ofthe assets in the banking system. That isn't necessarily alarge share by Asian standards, but it is a commandingposition.   Meanwhile, the economy is woefully short of capital, inlarge part because of the government's enormous borrowingneeds. That increases competition for funds and allows banksto ask uncompetitive rates.   Yet bankers still complain that their profits are limitedby unusually high reserve requirements of 25% -- comparedwith levels elsewhere in the region normally below 10% -- andby rules forcing them to make 25% of their loans to ruralenterprises and an additional 5% to 10% to small businesses.The reserve requirement is part of a Central Bank policydesigned to help meet tough new International Monetary Fundtargets.   But because a large percentage of the reserves can be usedto buy government Treasury bills -- which yielded as much as33.9% in December and now about 17.5%, sympathy for bankersis in short supply. One banker said the earnings on Treasurybills alone was high enough to cover the bank's overheadexpenses.</TEXT></DOC>
