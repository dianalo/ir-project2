The rule is based on a technical study performed by Rogersand Associates Engineering Corporation for the Texas Low-Level RadioactiveWaste Disposal Authority. The technical report was presented to the TexasBureau of Radiation Control in support of a request for rule making.Radiation Control staff reviewed the study and formally proposed regulationsbased on the study's results. After a public comment period, the rulewas adopted by the Texas State Board of Health. The rule went into effectMay 8, 1987. This paper summarizes the technical study, the actual rulemaking process, and, finally, a licensing action allowing this methodof disposal.</TEXT></DOC>
