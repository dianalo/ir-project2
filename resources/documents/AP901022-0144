Army chief Gen. Martin Bonnet sentenced former Col. Momahed AliSeineldin to 60 days at the Fourth Army Corps base in La Pampa, 391miles southwest of Buenos Aires.   ``I can't give details,'' Seineldin said. ``Tonight, I leave forLa Pampa.''   The cause of his arrest was a 5-page letter Seineldin deliveredSaturday to the presidential compound at Olivos, a Buenos Airessuburb, while Menem was in Europe on a state visit.   The letter said ``the state of unrest'' among officers andcommissioned troops could lead to ``extremely dangerous''incidents.   But military officials and politicians have discounted thepossibility of another revolt like the three that occurred betweenApril 1987 and December 1988, undermining the government of formerPresident Raul Alfonsin, Menem's predecessor.   Seineldin's letter instead was considered insubordination.   Defense Minister Humberto Romero said Seineldin's statements andarrest ``in no way ... can find an echo in the rest of that armedservice.''   Vice President Eduardo Duhalde said, ``It seems that certainsectors would take advantage of the absence of the president totake ... liberties.''   He ordered Bonnet give Seineldin the harshest sanctionapplicable - 60 days arrest - for an officer who violates themilitary chain of command.   Seineldin, a 56-year-old former commando, led a hard-line groupwithin the army that opposed the trials of fellow officers forhuman rights abuses committed in the 1976-83 regime's crackdown onalleged leftist subversives.   At least 9,000 Argentines disappeared during the military's``dirty war'' against suspected subversives and are presumed dead.   During Seineldin's 4-day uprising in December 1988, he demandedthe army budget be increased and top generals replaced. Accordingto Seineldin, then army chief Gen. Jose Caridi agreed to thedemands, then reneged.   Seineldin said he was prompted to write to Menem becauseofficers who agree with him are being denied promotion, the armybudget still is inadequate, and the shake-up in the militaryhierarchy never took place.   ``I consider it a duty to tell the commander-in-chief of thearmed forces about something I believe is extremely dangerous forthe future of the armed forces and the Argentine nation,'' he saidin the letter.   Seineldin and cashiered Lt. Col. Aldo Rico, who led the firsttwo uprisings in April 1987 and January 1988, both insist they aresoldiers who want to return to uniform.   Both have held public meetings and rallies this year in anapparent attempt to mobilize political dissent that stems fromchronic economic problems and Menem's plan to sell money-losingstate enterprises many Argentines consider the national patrimony.   Rico is a minor-party candidate for governor of Buenos AiresProvince, the country's most populous, in elections set forNovember 1991.   Spokesmen for Seineldin distributed the Menem letter Saturday toreporters and asked them to cover his probable arrest on Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
