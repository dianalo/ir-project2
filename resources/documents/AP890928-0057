PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An emigration boom permitted by Soviet politicalreforms likely will force Washington to turn away more than 200,000Soviets next year after decades of pressing Moscow to freeemigration, U.S. officials say.   Under new regulations that take effect on Oct. 1, would-beemigrants must fill out a questionnaire that will be sent directlyto Washington for consideration.   Officials in Washington will then send notices to those whoqualify for interviews at the Moscow embassy. The system depends,however, on the notoriously slow and unreliable Soviet mail andU.S. officials acknowledged that people who deserve to emigrate mayfall between the cracks.   U.S. Embassy officials said Wednesday they expect 300,000applications in 1990 but will accept just 50,000 refugees. Anadditional 20,000 to 30,000 Soviets may enter the country on aconditional basis.   Besides setting ceilings to contain growing numbers of potentialU.S. immigrants, the new procedure is intended to cut down on thelong lines outside the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.   The line to receive an application was said at one point toinclude thousands of people, and a spot at the front reportedlycost hundreds of dollars in bribes to Soviet police.   Jews, who long have been an American priority, worry they willnow be forgotten. Refuseniks believe the new procedures will limitJewish emigration to the United States at a time when they sayanti-Semitism is on the rise in the Soviet Union.   ``The situation here is getting worse,'' Elena Rappoport, aleader of the Jewish refusenik group Poor Relatives, said in aninterview.   The U.S. has said the 1990 Soviet immigration ceiling is higherthan the roughly 50,000 Soviets the United States will admit thisyear.   ``There is a limit to the number of Soviet emigrants, and to thenumber of emigrants the United States can take,'' a U.S. Embassyofficial said on condition of anonymity.   Under the new regulations, three-quarters of the spaces arelikely to go to applicants with relatives in the United States.Members of groups considered to be persecuted in the Soviet Union,such as Jews and Pentacostalists, are also considered a priority.   Jews will no longer be able to leave the country on an Israelivisa and then apply for admission to the United States in Vienna orRome, where thousands are now waiting.   Jews and Armenians together still make up the vast majority ofthe applicants, but U.S. officials are seeing large increases inapplications from others since President Mikhail S. Gorbachevliberalized emigration procedures.   They said 10 percent, or more than 1,000, of the applicants inAugust, were ethnic Russians, few with relatives in the UnitedStates.   One would-be applicant, 18-year-old Vladimir Azarov of Moscow,said he had some brushes with the law because of his politicalviews and wanted to receive political refugee status.   ``It's not that I have a big reason to leave the Soviet Union,it's just that I want to live in the United States,'' he said.   The United States is appealing to other Western countries tohelp, the U.S. Embassy official said.   ``Nowhere is it written that the United States should be theonly destination of Soviets who want to emigrate.''</TEXT></DOC>
