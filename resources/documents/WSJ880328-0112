Christian Hill (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK </IN><TEXT>   Daily operating losses by the nation's most insolvent thrifts have accelerated to the point that they could consume all the cash the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. can earn or borrow over the next several years.    The pace of the losses indicates that the agency will have trouble reducing its huge liability for failures even if no more thrifts go broke and no more real estate loans go bad.    Last Thursday, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board reported that the 345 most insolvent savings and loan institutions had losses of $9.5 billion in 1987, increasing the estimated cost of closing them to nearly $30 billion. The bank board has said that many of the losses resulted from one-time write-downs of real estate. But the report also showed that these thrifts were generating operating losses, apart from write-downs, at a yearly rate of $6 billion, up sharply from previous quarters.    The operating loss rate is crucial, because it indicates future losses that will be difficult for regulators to reduce, and it greatly increases the cost of rescues. The FSLIC is already insolvent itself, reporting a negative net worth of $6.3 billion at the end of 1986, an amount that would be greatly higher under more realistic accounting principles. It hasn't reported 1987 results.    The FSLIC expects to earn or borrow about $20 billion over the next three years as part of a recapitalization plan. M. Danny Wall, the bank board's chairman, has argued that the proceeds are adequate to pay for thrift closures over the next three years. But at the current rate of operating losses, the FSLIC's current problem cases would lose an additional $18 billion over the same period. Additional losses are expected from more write-downs and from new failures among an additional 150 to 200 Sandamp;Ls teetering on the brink of insolvency.    &quot;The FSLIC's money is going out faster than it is coming in,&quot; says Warren Heller, research director at Veribanc Inc., a Woburn, Mass., consulting firm. &quot;If they can get through 1988, they'll be lucky.&quot;    The number of thrifts considered insolvent even under liberal regulatory accounting rules accelerated last year, as did their operating loss rate. According to federal statistics compiled by Veribanc, their operating losses averaged $890 million in the first two quarters, jumped 22% to $1.09 billion in the third quarter, and an additional 38%, to $1.5 billion, in the fourth quarter. The latest increase may reflect the addition of huge American Savings, a unit of Financial Corp. of America, to the ranks of the officially insolvent.    The operating losses result mainly from the lack of interest income from a growing amount of nonperforming real estate loans, and from the high price most thrifts have to pay for deposits because of their industry's well-publicized problems. James Barth, the bank board's chief economist, says regulators hope to reduce the losses with such steps as the Southwest Plan, which will shut down or consolidate many Texas thrifts and sell some of them to buyers willing to infuse new capital. Mr. Wall says the plan could attract as much as $1 billion of new capital. The moves are also expected to reduce operating costs, and restore depositor confidence, reducing thrifts' money costs.    &quot;If we can deal with Texas's insolvent thrifts through the Southwest Plan, one can get that (deposit) premium down, and then it tends to go down for all thrifts,&quot; Mr. Barth says.    But the Texas thrifts' daily operating losses are so large that buyers demand long-term assistance agreements, under which the agency would continue to pay for the thrifts' built-in losses. &quot;It's really difficult to say a case has been resolved&quot; when a problem Sandamp;L is sold under such agreements, another thrift economist says.    A recent thrift consolidation touted as a model for the Southwest Plan, the merger of four insolvent thrifts into Pelican Savings in Louisiana, didn't bring in any new capital and left the FSLIC liable for all of the continuing operating losses.    &quot;We are going to stay out of Texas,&quot; says the skeptical chief executive of an investment fund that is negotiating to acquire other failed thrifts. &quot;Even if you take a squeaky clean thrift, you'll make minimal money because you're paying such a huge premium for deposits.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
