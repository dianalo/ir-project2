But wait. Here's an analyst who says Motown has the ingredients to become one of the nation's most profitable metropolitan areas for retailers.    Detroit's elements of retailing success are threefold: a projected growth in retail sales of twice the national average, a slow but steady population loss, and, ironically, its notorious reputation as a city on the skids.    This last point means that retailers thinking of expansion tend to overlook Detroit's economic fundamentals, says James Newton, president of Economic Perspectives Inc., a Delaware, Ohio, retail-consulting firm. &quot;They say, 'Why in the world would I want to move to a place like that?'&quot;    He notes a just-released survey commissioned by the New York real-estate firm Cushman andamp; Wakefield. About 400 corporate chief executives were asked to rank 30 cities as places to locate new or expanded businesses. Guess which finished last?    But Mr. Newton counsels clients to forget the ritual Detroit bashing and look at some figures. Between 1986 and 1991, total retail sales in the Detroit metropolitan area should increase an average 4% a year. That's seventh-highest among the 23 large metro areas included in Mr. Newton's computer model. Projected U.S. annual retail growth in this period is 2%. The sales figures are adjusted to eliminate the effects of inflation.    &quot;It's no longer just a big auto town. People there are showing income gains and other types of businesses are moving in,&quot; Mr. Newton says.    Retailers invariably flock to areas where population is expanding, as the explosion of Sun Belt shopping malls attests. But opportunities for profits in high-growth areas can be dicey, given the competition from all the new merchants. Mr. Newton suggests looking instead at areas where people are spending more and population is stable. Detroit fits the bill. Its metro population is actually shrinking on the order of 0.1% a year through 1991, he says.    Given these basics, &quot;Detroit becomes the hottest prospect in terms of per-capita retail sales growth,&quot; Mr. Newton says. Sales per person in the Detroit metro area should increase slightly over 4% a year through 1991. The runner-up hot retail markets are Newark, N.J.; Baltimore; Nassau-Suffolk (Long Island), N.Y., and Philadelphia.    At the bottom of the list are three metro areas where Mr. Newton says per-capita retail sales will actually decline in the next five years. They are Kansas City, Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth.    Remember that Detroit and Newark include clusters of well-to-do suburbs as well as decaying inner cities within their metropolitan areas. Morris County, N.J., part of Newark's statistical base, had per-capita personal income of $19,518 in 1984, making it the 22nd most-affluent county in the U.S. Oakland County outside Detroit had personal income of nearly $18,000.    ---   PENTAGON SPENDING gets spread among the states even though California defense contractors won 20% of all Defense Department prime contract awards in the 1986 fiscal year, a procurement package worth $27.74 billion.    Other states got their teeth into the defense budget in their own ways. Minnesota led all states in ammunition contracts in fiscal 1986 with orders worth $931 million. Ohio won about one-third of Pentagon aircraft-engine contracts; Michigan had one-third of combat-vehicle orders, and Connecticut shipyards took one-fifth of all ship contracts. Alabama was tops in &quot;textiles, clothing and equipage&quot; orders.    ---   ARIZONA STUDENTS visited trailer campgrounds in metropolitan Phoenix in February and calculated that 47,000 mobile homes and recreational vehicles spent much of the past winter parked in the Arizona capital area. The Arizona State University researchers went on to figure: If each vehicle averaged two residents, and expenses of a typical couple ran $1,000 a month for four months, then the mobile snowbirds pumped some $188 million into the Phoenix winter economy.    ---   CALIFORNIA'S MANUFACTURING MUSCLE: Los Angeles County was No. 1 among all U.S. counties in manufacturing shipments last year, and Santa Clara County, the center of California's computer and electronics industry, was No. 5. Of the 20 top manufacturing counties nationwide in 1986, eight were outside the Great Lakes-Northeast corridor, the region long synonymous with U.S. manufacturing strength. The figures are from the Survey of Industrial and Commercial Buying Power compiled by Sales and Marketing Management magazine.    ---   CIRCLE THESE DATES: Annual Conference of Mayors, June 12-17, Nashville, Tenn.; Western Governors' Association annual meeting, July 5-7, Snowbird, Utah; National Association of Counties annual conference, July 11-14, Indianapolis, Ind.; Multi-state Tax Commission annual meeting, July 15-17, Washington, D.C.; National Governors' Association annual meeting, July 26-29, Traverse City, Mich.; National Conference of State Legislatures annual meeting, July 26-31, Indianapolis, Ind.; Southern Legislative Conference, Aug. 16-20, Little Rock, Ark. </TEXT></DOC>
