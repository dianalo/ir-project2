Nomani (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> CMD PCS PET MON </IN><DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wheat prices rose for the third consecutive trading day amid reports by grain company sources that the Soviet Union is closing a big deal on the purchase of wheat from the Common Market.    Estimates for the anticipated purchase range widely from 500,000 metric tons to two million metric tons of wheat.    Even though the anticipated purchase wouldn't be from the U.S., the reports boosted wheat futures prices because such a purchase would reduce the global supply of the commodity. &quot;This will promote further scurrying for exports,&quot; said Richard Loewy, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York.    At the Chicago Board of Trade Wednesday, the wheat contract for December delivery closed at $4.265 a bushel, up 1.25 cents a bushel. The price edged closer to the December contract high of $4.31, set July 14.    After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department confirmed the sale of 300,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat to the Soviets. This brings Soviet purchases of U.S. wheat this year to just over two million metric tons.    Last year, the European Economic Community sold 2.7 million metric tons of wheat to the Soviet Union, while U.S. sales to the Soviets accounted for 12 million metric tons.    Wheat futures drifted lower at the opening of trading yesterday because of reports that the Agriculture Department had rejected several wheat export sales, traders said.    Those rejected offers were for 120,000 metric tons to Jordan, 110,000 metric tons to Iraq, 50,000 metric tons to Tunisia and 40,000 metric tons to Egypt, analysts said. The Agriculture Department most commonly rejects bids when it decides that countries aren't offering enough money for a purchase.    Wheat prices were buoyed as traders anticipated that the four bids would be resubmitted and accepted by the Agriculture Department.    The rise in wheat prices helped push up corn and soybean futures prices, although they ended the day mixed. The December-delivery contract for corn closed at $3.025 a bushel, down two cents a bushel. The soybean contract for November delivery also fell, dropping 3.5 cents a bushel to $8.97 a bushel.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   ENERGY: World oil prices continued to drift lower, with North Sea crudes down about 30 cents a barrel at the end of the trading day. In moderate activity on the U.S. futures market yesterday, crude prices traded in a relatively narrow band after Tuesday's sharp fall, swinging up or down about 10 cents a barrel, and then they settled mostly lower. West Texas Intermediate for October delivery closed eight cents a barrel lower, at $14.16 -- the lowest price since September 1986, when spot-month crude traded at $14 a barrel. After the close of futures trading, the American Petroleum Institute released its weekly U.S. statistics, which showed a big drawdown in crude inventories despite high production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. That was considered bullish for current weak oil markets.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices posted modest gains. December-delivery gold advanced 90 cents an ounce to $435.70. December silver rose six cents an ounce to $6.6850. Platinum for October delivery gained $3.80 an ounce to $527.90. One analyst attributed the steadier tone in precious metals to the &quot;slowing of the downward momentum&quot; of crude oil; that commodity fell again yesterday, but recovered slightly from its lows. The analyst said he thought weakness of the dollar, paticularly against the yen, also helped boost precious metals prices. He added that there was a slight improvement in demand for gold and silver bullion, which has been lackluster recently.    COCOA: Futures prices again fell to new life-of-contract lows in most delivery months. The supply-demand balance remained overwhelmingly bearish. December-delivery cocoa declined to as low as $1,190 a metric ton before recovering slightly to end at $1,199, down $28. The only positions that didn't register new lows were the expiring contract for September 1988 delivery, for which yesterday's lowest price was $10 above its life-of-contract low, and the September 1989 position, which matched its contract low. According to a U.S. Department of Agriculture computation that is widely followed in the cocoa industry, the average price of the three soonest-maturing futures months yesterday was the lowest in 13 years. The average was $1,186, below the average of $1,195 for the three nearest months in September 1975, an analyst said. Analysts said a lack of progress in negotiations of the International Cocoa Agreement, which is meeting in London, continued to depress the market. Analysts noted that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development forecast three more seasons of surplus cocoa production and expressed concern for the future of the cocoa pact. A proposal was presented to the ICCO council to lift the $30-a-ton export levy on exporting countries, analysts said, but one observed that the tax even now is virtually nonexistent. Producing-country members owe an estimated $68 million to the ICCO, and a major portion of that would include export taxes, he said.    CURRENCIES: Currency futures settled mixed after a choppy session highlighted by a sharp rise in the yen and cross-trading between the yen and European currencies. &quot;There's no clear direction,&quot; a Chicago currency analyst said of the markets. September yen futures settled 0.0086 cent stronger, at 0.7506 cent. The bulk of the yen's sharp rise occurred in Tokyo trading, where it soared on Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita's assertion that the Japanese central bank will intervene and take other steps if the yen declines further. The Japanese currency also was aided by a rise in Japan's one-month bill discount rate yesterday, and traders said that, because Japan imports large amounts of oil, the yen was underpinned by sharply lower oil prices. Generally, sentiment remains friendly toward currencies because the weak August U.S. employment data have clouded the outlook for further tightening in U.S. monetary policy, traders said. However, many traders said dealings might remain choppy before U.S. producer price index and trade data are released. </TEXT></DOC>
