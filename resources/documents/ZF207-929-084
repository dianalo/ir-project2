Schlageter, Journal ofObject-Oriented Programming, May/June 1989, Vol.andP;  2 No.1)andM;Some of these buzz words have been co-opted from mathematics, but seldom withthe care and precision that the queen of sciences has shown to be essential.andO;Classes that are members of themselves (self-inheritance?) have been known tocause a malady known in Formal Systems circles as &quot;sets-mania&quot;.andP;  Poor peoplestruggling to get a payroll package up and running now face viciouslyself-referential paradoxes formerly confined to purer areas of mathematics.andO;Brecht's &quot;Erst kommt die Fressen, dann kommt die Moral&quot; (&quot;Don't moralize onan empty stomach&quot;) might be updated to read: &quot;Before searching forReusability, let us first establish Usability&quot;.andM;One can imagine the head of MIS explaining to a restless gathering of unpaidstaff:andM;The current absence of an entity-relationship between objects in the classCheck and objects in the class Employee is simply due to an unfortunateshortfall in the number of available instantiations of the classRemuneratedEmployee.andP;  Our programming staff is doing its utmost to remedythis situation.andP;  But while I have you all together, may I take a moment ofyour time to remind you of Poincare's work on impredicative definitions[Poin89].andP;  As you all know, proper or predicative definitions are not allowedto refer to the whole of the class of which the term being defined is amember.andP;  Russell used these ideas in his theory of types [KellBoo87] [Russ29]andM;.andP;  .  .An irate worker interrupts: &quot;Will this bleedin' Russell pay my bleedin'mortgage, that's what I want to know!&quot;andM;Repository of Lost SoulsandM;The database scholars hover between the old and new lexicons, usingabstractions such as entity-relationship and asymmetrical outer joinalongside concretions such as repository and portfolio.andP;  Is a repository somekind of musty Victorian warehouse full of forgotten bric-a-brac, or is itpart of an IBM IRDS (Information Resource Dictionary System).andP;  Or is it both?andO;In any event, the search for a standard repository is clearly the subject ofmuch debate.andP;  In our sibling magazine Database Programming and Design (August1988), I read:andM;Standards are particularly important in light of IBM's immanent (well,someday, at least) repository.andM;The Oxford American Dictionary defines immanent as &quot;(Of God) permanentlypervading the Universe&quot;.andP;  When I was with IBM in the 1950s, this wascertainly T.J.andP;  Watson's master plan.andP;  My God, how near he came!andP;  And had Istayed with IBM, who knows?andP;  Perhaps the cure for the RDB standardspain-in-the-ass imbroglio is an &quot;imminent suppository&quot;.andP;  (The editors ofDatabase Programming and Design never replied, by the way, to my query andfollow-up asking if &quot;immanent&quot; was a typo, or a subtle theologicalstatement.eandM;I propose two new disciplines to tidy up the growing terminological mess:Generology--the study of nothing in particular; and Instantology--the scienceof avoiding things in general.andP;  The latter could lead to a Miguel de Unamunorevival!andP;  All is particular!andP;  Down with abstraction and false objectivity!andO;Hail the concrete, individual man of bone and flesh (carne y hueso).andM;Inanitities Go Leor!andM;In the Times Literary Supplement of June 2-8, 1989, Peter Geach quotesKotarbinski:andM;Why flight the absurd?andP;  If you have things to say, Let nonsense rattle on,and work a different way!andM;This tempted me to drop my Great Inanity Contest, but so many readers havesent me quotes and clippings that I will persist and award the promised bookprize.andP;  Recall, too, that there will be a prize for the best Profunditysubmitted (see Vol.andP;  7 No.andP;  5, p. 21, for details).andP;  Entries are stillpouring in (for which many thanks), so I will delay my verdict until nextmonth.andM;The Growing E/S ControversyandM;Responses to my max (E/S) challenge--where E is the total length of the errormessages generated by source code of length S [is greater than] 0--becamebizarrer with each sackload of mail.andP;  Evelyn C. Leeper refined thefunny-command-line approach to get an E/S of 1483/1 using the Amdahl 5.2u370compiler under SCR2 UTS.andP;  By using long, nonexistent paths (which thecompiler echoes while warning &quot;no such file or directory&quot;) together withweird switches, the max (E/S) of Evelyn's method seems limited only bycommand-line syntax intolerance and the maximum command line available.andM;Adam Blum of KMS (Arlington, VA) exploits the fact that many compilers allowyou to embed #defines in the command line.andP;  Adam is more interested in theshortest program that will crash your compiler, whether or not it manages tocomplain first.andP;  The following suggestion is offered: a.c.andP;  contains the fivebytes a(){C.andP;  You compile with:andM;cc -DA=&quot;if (1)&quot; -DB=&quot; A A A A A A A A A= -DC=&quot; B B B B B B B B&quot; a.candM;(use &quot;cl&quot; for MSC 5.0 or &quot;tcc&quot; for Turbo C).andM;Again, the trick is to reduce the value of X at the expense of command-lineprofusion.andP;  DOS users suffer here from the command-line limit of 127characters!andM;Bostonian DetourandM;This reminds me of a convivial dinner I enjoyed in Boston recently with TomClune and Peter Dufault of ERI, Tom's wife Nancy Hayes of Byte magazine (Tomclaims to be 100-percent Hayes compatible), my wife, Iwonka, John RolandElliott and Dan Smith of Wang Laboratories, and Elizabeth Bayle of BowersDevelopment.andP;  The main topic of conversation was the local obsession withspatial translations in the vehicular environment.andP;  Bostonians, not tomention visitors to Boston, spend most of their time discussing how to get bycar from point A to point B, where A and B are not necessarily distinct.andP;  Thestandard conclusion is that A is a perfectly satisfactory place to be, sowhat's the big deal with getting to B?andP;  The Bostonian street topology ensuresthat start and end points are either simply not connected, or not simplyconnected.andP;  I'm used to undirectional mazes in London and New york, but inBoston the prevailing street-vectors change their arrows randomly, from blockto block, and sometimes in mid-block.andP;  I was puzzled at first by an apparentcounterexample: the 34,000 fans we encountered at Fenway Park, home of theBoston Red Sox, seem able to reach the ballpark on a regular basis.andP;  It isnow my firm conviction that these fans are born, live, and die at Fenway, andtransportation does not enter the equation.andM;Our talk eventually turned to matters computational.andP;  There was the usualidle conjecture as to whether mathematical laws were inviolable.andP;  If a kettleof water placed on a hot stove has a small but finite probability of freezingsolid, the question arises whether, say, 32 might not fleetingly become aprime and al that that entails.andP;  Godel, Cohen, Lowenheim, and Skolem were allinvoked and toasted.andP;  And toasted.andP;  I suddenly recalled Rudi Langer'sglorious lemma:andM;2 + 2 = 5 for sufficiently large values of 2andM;This is guaranteed to end all serious, postpradial, mathematical debates.andM;We therefore moved on to toast the max (E/S) problem.andP;  John Elliot suggestedthat if the maximum available command line was a critical factor, why notdevise a command-line switch /E[1] [+] nnn that would decrease/increase thelegal command-line length by nnn characters.andP;  To curtail the ensuingarguments as to where this new switch could be legally placed, we decidedthat this would be &quot;implementation-dependent--please consult and toast yournetwork manger&quot;.andM;Back to the CoastandM;J.G.andP;  Owen of Fort Salonga, NY, did not submit a particular E/S, but heclaims his Aztec CP/M C compiler &quot;will generate as many erros as you likewhen your file ends without the sacred control-Z--which it will when someperfectly legitimate CP/M text editors produce a file a precise multiple of128 bytes in length--about every 128 edits, quite randomly of course, thecompiler spews out the most profuse series of complaints concerning anendless text consisting entirely of little triangles.&quot;andM;Likewise, Wayne Hathaway of Ultra Network Technologies (San Jose, CA) reportsthat &quot;back in the mid-60s, while working on a fair-sized COBOL program, Imanaged to omit one single character--the hyphen in WORKING-STORAGE--andreceived 147 pages of error messages.&quot;andM;But the First E/S Prize must go to Mike Allison of Monterey, CA, for sheerindustry and persistence.andP;  Dissatisfied with the error-message-generationpropensities of commercially available compilers, he resorted to theyacc-alike BISON to create his own Pascal putative parser.andP;  He is nowrewarded with at least 100 error messages whatever the input!andP;  Even thenullish &quot;begin end&quot; results in several rapidly scrolling screenloads ofnit-picking complaints.andP;  Mike will receive Programming in C++ by Dewhurst andStark (Prentice-Hall, 1989), a highly recommended, practical book on C++ thatdeserves to be known simply as Dandamp;S.andM;The runner-up is Evelyn C. Leeper (prize: one-year free subscription to aMiller Freeman computer magazine of choice).andP;  Distinguished HonorableMentions for Charles Wright of Fresno, CA, and George Dinwiddle of Columbia,MD, whose &quot;null-but-fun&quot; programs were discussed last month.andP;  My thanks toall entrants.andM;Not Really Another QuizandM;Who is the odd one out in the following aggregation?andP;  Homer, Aristophanes,Kelly-Bottle, Cicero, Theodorakis.andP;  Hint: my Mastering Turbo C (Sybex) is nowavailable in a Greek translation titled (I transliterate) PLERES EGXEIRIDIOTES TURBO C.andP;  Telephone Athens 36.24.947 for details.andP;  This beautiful book isfull of real modern Greek, not to be confused with the greeking used by DTPlayabouts.andP;  The cover blurb (O shame) proclaims: EPILEGMENAPARADEIGMATA--which really means &quot;Superb and Engaging Examples&quot;, but whichwill be widely construed as &quot;Chosen Paradigms&quot;.andP;  My exemplaryantiparadigmatic crusade is in tatters!andM;Stan Kelly-Bootle, who earned the world's first postgraduate diploma incomputer science some thirty years ago at Cambridge University, has beencomputing, on and off, ever since.andP;  He contributes his thoughts, linguisticand otherwise, monthly to UNIX REVIEW.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
