Another proposal would eliminate federal school lunch subsidiesfor children of middle and upper income families, requiring them topay 26 cents more per meal. The savings would amount to more than $3million a day.   Under the proposed budget to operate USDA in the year that willbegin Oct. 1, total spending would be held to $42.4 billion, downfrom the estimated outlays of $52.1 billion in the current fiscalyear.   ``As has been anticipated, this budget is largely irrelevant,''said Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate AgricultureCommittee. ``It might, of course, have been designed to make a Bushbudget appear kinder and gentler.''   Spending on the department's Commodity Credit Corp. programs,which includes wheat, corn and other major crop supports, woulddecline to a six-year low of less than $11.6 billion billion frommore than $13.8 billion in 1989. The peak was $25.8 billion in 1986.   The budget for CCC spending included $1.1 billion of unspecifiedcuts that would be decided by the incoming Bush administration andCongress. Future spending reductions in CCC programs could be in therange of $2 billion to $2.5 billion annually for 1991 through 1994.   Leahy said the Reagan blueprint for cutting farm programs raisesa question of whether the administration ``actually means to disarmunilaterally just two months before the next round of trade talks.''   The administration has urged under the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade that all subsidies and other practices thatinterfere with free trade be eliminated, but the idea hasn't caughton.   ``Cutting farm programs before obtaining an agreement from ourtrading partners to do the same seems likely to undermine our GATTnegotiating position,'' Leahy said in a statement.   Deputy Secretary Peter Myers said no legislation to carry out theCCC proposal would be sent to Congress at this time.   ``We're not going to be that presumptive,'' Myers said. ``We'regoing to say, `Congress, here's a way you can cut $1.1 billion. Doyou want to wrestle with it?' We think the Bush administrationshould have the perogative to look at it. It's a recommendation.It's an option.''   The Reagan budget proposal for operating CCC's farm programswould include a 5 percent reduction in target prices beginning withthe 1990 crops, and slightly larger cuts the following three years.Target prices are used to compute federal payments to farmers whenmarket prices fall short.   Robert A. Denman, director of international and public affairsfor the National Farmers Union, said most recent Reagan budgetproposals ``have been dead on arrival'' when sent to Congress,anyway.   The proposed 5 percent cut in crop target prices for 1990 on topof reductions already specified by the 1985 farm law may be part ofthe Reagan budget plan but Denman hoped that ``it wouldn'tnecessarily be in a Bush budget.''   ``This budget is not drastically different from previous Reaganbudgets,'' USDA budget director Stephen B. Dewhurst said. ``Thebasic position taken on farm programs is that we're spending toomuch money on them.''   In many other respects, the 1990 budget proposals for USDArepresent a continuation of Reagan administration policies,including some that had been rejected by Congress in the past.   For example, the 1990 budget seeks to eliminate school lunchsubsidies for non-needy children. Needy children would continuegetting free or reduced-price meals.   But a child from a family having an income of more than 185percent of the official poverty line _ $21,553 a year for a familyof four _ would have to pay about 26 cents more per day at theschool cafeteria, unless the states or local districts made up thedifference.   Overall food and consumer services, which take almost half of theUSDA's annual budget, would remain mostly intact, however. Totalspending would be almost $20.6 billion, down from $21.3 billion thisyear. Food stamps, which serve more than 18 million people, areexpected to cost about $12.7 billion, compared with almost $12.9billion currently.   A report by department budget analysts showed that spending forsmall community and rural development would be chopped by nearlytwo-thirds _ from $9.4 billion this year to $3.4 billion in fiscal1990. Existing housing loans and grants, at a spending level of$3.36 billion this year, would be terminated in favor of a housingvoucher program.   Farm loans of the Farmers Home Administration would be reduced to$3.7 billion from $4.9 billion this year and ``will continue theshift from direct loans to guaranteed loans'' established by the1985 farm law, the report said. Guaranteed operating loans areexpected to increase to $2.8 billion from $2.6 billion this year.   But FmHA disaster loans, reflecting hoped-for better weatherconditions, are expected to decline to around $50 million from $600million this year.   The budget report said FmHA will continue to help farm borrowersreschedule overdue loans so they can stay in business. However, manyhave gone under and the FmHA currently holds almost 5,000 farms inits inventory with a market value of about $650 million.   Some increases were called for in a number of USDA programs,including research and education, soil and water conservation, andfood safety and inspection services.   Also, the administration seeks $250 million in supplementalfinancing this fiscal year to help the Forest Service pay forfirefighting. A new plan was outlined to partially pay forfirefighting in the future by using money collected from timbersales and mining on federal lands.</TEXT></DOC>
