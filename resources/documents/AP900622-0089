One report put thedeath toll at 35,000.

Iran fought Iraq in the 1980-88 Persian Gulf war.   The first team of French doctors into earthquake-ravaged Iranset up a center to treat the wounded today. Iranian officials said11 emergency headquarters had been set up throughout the region.   Five medical workers with Doctors Without Borders set up anemergency center for the injured at an air force hospital inTehran, Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency reported.   Twenty-five more French doctors and nurses, 50 tons of medicalsupplies, water, temporary shelters and two all-terrain vehicleswere scheduled to leave this afternoon.   The French government promised to send a civil defense team of195 people and 18 search dogs, along with 24 tons of equipment.   In Geneva, a senior U.N. relief official said that according toa report by the Tehran government, an estimated 35,000 people hadbeen killed and more than 100,000 injured.   Fabrizio Gentiloni of the U.N. Disaster Relief Coordinator'soffice said the estimates were received from the Iranian ForeignMinistry.   The Red Crescent, the Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross,reported that by midnight Thursday, 12,000 bodies had beenrecovered and 20,000 injured were taken to hospitals. The RedCrescent also said at least 400,000 people were left homeless.   The Greek Red Cross planned to send 15 tons of supplies to Iran,and Japan pledged relief funds and goods worth more than $1.5million. Officials said Japanese rescuers would leave for Irantoday, bringing equipment such as sound detectors to help findpeople trapped beneath rubble.   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellarexpressed condolences to the Iranian government and the families ofthe victims of Thursday's earthquake, which leveled scores of townsand villages in northern Iran.   Perez de Cuellar, in a message to Rafsanjani, said Thursday theU.N. system was ready to provide all possible assistance. Itsdisaster relief coordinator dispatched an emergency team, and anairlift of emergency supplies from U.N. warehouses was undertakenin coordination with Iranian authorities, officials said.   A statement from the U.N. Disaster Relief Organization in Genevasaid the most immediate needs were for medicine, medical suppliesand tents. Other needs include canned food, blankets, clothing,vehicles and heavy-duty equipment.   The organization was sending a senior officer and reliefcoordination officer to the stricken areas, and a special taskforce was established at the Iranian president's office tocoordinate relief, the U.N. said.   The Iranian government already has allocated $14 million forrelief.   In Brussels, the European Community agreed to donate $1.2million to help send emergency relief equipment to the area, it wasannounced.   The British Red Cross announced it would give $17,300 forblankets, medical equipment, food and emergency lighting forvictims of the earthquake.   A private British charity, the International Rescue Corp., senta 17-member rescue team to Iran today after receiving a request forhelp from Iranian officials, according to team coordinator TerryPrice.   He said the team, which includes two paramedics, took alongequipment including heat-seeking devices, ultrasonic listeningequipement, portable thermic lancers for cutting through debris andportable satellite communications gear.   The group, formed by British firefighters in 1979, has hadrescue experience in earthquakes in Mexico City, El Salvador andArmenia.   Brian Ruberry, a spokesman for the American Red Cross inWashington, said the organization was raising money rather thanshipping the supplies, and had established a toll-free nationwidetelephone number for people wanting to make contributions.   ``We're attempting to raise money to send to the Red CrescentSociety to help buy tents, blankets, food, medical supplies andemergency lighting,'' he said.   AmeriCares, based in New Canaan, Conn., said in a statement thatit was ready to send containers of medicine and other reliefsupplies to Iran ``as soon as clearance has been received from theIranian government to land our aircraft in that country.''   President Bush's administration offered humanitarian assistanceand sent a message of condolence to the government.   The messages was delivered to Iran by another unidentifiedcountry because the United States has not had diplomatic relationswith Tehran since 1979, when Iranian militants took Americanshostage in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The hostages were held for444 days.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   Editors: The toll-free number set up by the American Red Crossfor contributions is 1-800-842-2200.</TEXT></DOC>
