The physicalmeaning of the supermodes solution is given. Under the condition of thelowest supermodes, the analytic expressions for pulsewidth, intensityand peak position are deduced. The effect of noise on supermodes solutionof the synchronously pumped mode--locking dye laser is studied. The expressionsfor the spectrum of noise, the method of evaluating the noise sourceand the ratio of noise to signal are also obtained.</TEXT></DOC>
