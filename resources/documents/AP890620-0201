(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A father and son surrendered Tuesday oncharges of defrauding the Defense Department by using lower-qualityscrap metal in engine parts built into thousands of militaryaircraft and tanks.   Russell K. Baker Sr., 63, and Russell K. Baker Jr., 40, of theTampa area, both former presidents and general managers of AerodyneInvestment Castings Inc., were indicted Monday. Also indicted wasCarman Eugene Alexander, 55, a former chief engineer from Converse,Ind.   The Bakers surrendered in Tampa and were released on $100,000bail. Alexander was to surrender in Indianapolis, said AssistantU.S. Attorney Andrew Grosso. No court date was set.   The federal indictment charges them with plotting to defraud thegovernment by using less expensive scrap instead of pure metal formilitary aircraft and M-1 Abrams tank parts, then certifying thattests showed the parts met specifications for pure alloys.   Alexander and Baker Jr. were charged with lying to the Army abouttest results for turbine blade parts and trying to hide the factthat the blades didn't meet contract specifications.   The government said the two falsely identified failing results onlab reports as non-valid and omitted failed test results oncertifications to the Army.   Baker Jr. also was charged with obstructing justice for allegedlyapproving a report for the Department of Defense that containedfalse and misleading information.   The blades manufactured during a 7-year period are used on morethan 22,000 aircraft, including F-16 jets, as well as helicoptersand tanks.   ``There also appears to be danger to personnel which is not beingadequately addressed by the Department of Defense,'' Rep. JohnDingell, D-Mich., told ABC News. ``I describe the military responseto this problem as being seriously inadequate, callous and probablyseriously indifferent.''   If convicted, Alexander faces up to 40 years in prison and $1.5million in fines; the elder Baker faces 20 years and $520,000, andhis son 45 years and $1.7 million.   The Bakers, along with another of the elder Baker's sons, Roger,35, were also indicted in April on 11 counts of fraud, conspiracy,money laundering and theft against Aerodyne.   They have pleaded innocent to the charges against the company. Notrial date has been set in that case but is expected sometime inJuly.</TEXT></DOC>
