Few are, so Wall Street deal makers are in a tizzy.    The big worry is that disgruntled investment banking clients -- relying on the ruling -- might refuse to pay fees, or might sue to recover funds paid. This apparently hasn't happened, but some firms wouldn't publicly discuss the decision out of fear of becoming a litigation target.    &quot;Everyone wants to be free to say 'this doesn't apply to me,'&quot; one securities attorney said.    Based on a little-noticed clause in the state code, Judge Armand Arabian ruled June 21 that Barrington Associates, a small Los Angeles investment banking concern, couldn't collect a $227,800 fee because it lacked the real-estate license required to legally negotiate sale of a &quot;business opportunity.&quot;    The decision is so sweeping, attorneys say, it could be applied to most large transactions, such as a tender offer to California investors by an out-of-state company. Deal makers practicing without a real-estate license are subject to $5,000 in fines and six months in prison.    &quot;It's a ludicrous decision,&quot; railed James Freedman, managing director of Barrington, which specializes in transactions valued at between $5 million and $150 million. &quot;This is sending a shock wave through our industry,&quot; said Lloyd Greif, executive vice president of corporate finance at Sutro andamp; Co., a 131-year-old San Francisco investment banking firm.    While most Mandamp;A professionals are perplexed about what to do, their attorneys in California and New York are telling them that the decision has the force of law and must be taken seriously.    &quot;Investment bankers have two shots before they go to real-estate school -- one in the courts and one in the legislature,&quot; said Guido R. Henry Jr., a partner in the Los Angeles office of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley andamp; McCloy, one of the law firms representing Barrington.    Several New York firms are helping pay Barrington's legal bills, Mr. Freedman said. He wouldn't identify the firms, citing &quot;sensitivities&quot; about their support. A Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. spokesman acknowledged that the firm &quot;is one of five participating in the petition.&quot; CS First Boston Group, believed to be another, wouldn't comment.    Barrington petitioned the California Supreme Court July 31 to review the appellate court decision. In a nutshell, Barrington argues that the court erred by extending the definition of &quot;the sale of a business opportunity&quot; to include sophisticated corporate transactions.    The California &quot;business opportunity&quot; license was created in 1937 to protect sellers of grocery stores, gasoline service stations, bakers and other small businesses, the petition says. (The business opportunity and real-estate licensing requirements were merged in 1965 because it was decided that the value of most small businesses is largely reflected in their property holdings.)    The Securities Industry Association, whose 625 members conduct more than 90% of all U.S. securities business, has retained Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher andamp; Flom to file a friend-of-the-court brief with the California Supreme Court. And Orrick, Herrington andamp; Sutcliffe, another law firm working for the trade group, is working feverishly in Sacramento to get an amendment to the state code passed before legislators adjourn Sept. 15 for the year.    Despite the importance of the case to investment bankers, the California court might be too busy reviewing death-penalty convictions and other matters to hear the case. If the court does agree to consider Barrington, a decision could be a year or more away. Thus, simply changing the law might be a swifter, surer solution.    &quot;We're working on putting Humpty Dumpty together again,&quot; said Sen. John Garamendi (D., Sacramento) who introduced a securities industry-sponsored measure. The measure, which technically amends Senate Bill 1209, could come up for a vote on the assembly floor next week. The amendment would exempt licensed broker-dealers, who are already regulated by state and federal authorities, from the real-estate license requirement.    Sen. Garamendi noted that the issue poses potential political problems with the real-estate industry that he has been working to avoid. &quot;The Realtors don't want us to do anything that diminishes their turf; I don't think we will,&quot; he said.    Real-estate agents have complained about increasing competition from the real-estate brokerage divisions of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and other investment banking giants. While these divisions hold real-estate brokerage licenses -- and aren't an issue in the Barrington case -- their success has contributed to concerns about poachers.    &quot;We don't want securities dealers involved in our business,&quot; said Alexander Creel, vice president of governmental affairs for the California Association of Realtors. But real-estate agents probably will accept a proposal that eliminates any dual license requirement for firms that stick to the traditional investment banking business, he said.    &quot;It doesn't make sense {under such circumstances} to require multiple licenses,&quot; agreed Robin Wilson, chief legal counsel in the state's Department of Real Estate. There haven't been any recent complaints or criminal prosecutions involving &quot;business opportunity sales&quot; and there are no plans to investigate investment banking firms, he added.    However, the real-estate department did submit a brief in the Barrington appellate case advising that the company should have a real-estate license. Barrington, like many small investment banking concerns, has neither a real-estate brokerage nor a broker-dealer license.    The emerging legislative solution thus appears likely to exclude Barrington and other unlicensed investment banking firms. The big New York and regional firms are licensed broker-dealers, but some small investment banking concerns have been exempted from securities license requirements because they don't receive or hold funds or securities for their customers.    While state real-estate schools say they haven't noticed many new students in pinstriped suits, a handful of Mandamp;A specialists are getting licenses to play it safe. &quot;We've starting signing up our people and some have already started taking classes,&quot; Barrington's Mr. Freedman said.    ---@ California's Top Deal Makers    Ranked by dollar value of 1988 transactions in which the acquiring or acquired company was based in California. @ Estimated % of Total @ Amount Market Number Number @Financial Adviser (in mils)* Share Of Deals Of Deals @Goldman Sachs $14,627.8 36.8% 26 3.8% @Drexel Burnham @ Lambert 14,079.2 35.4 36 5.3 @Morgan Stanley 12,410.8 31.2 21 3.1 @First Boston 11,526.4 29.0 15 2.2 @Shearson Lehman @ Hutton 10,459.6 26.3 25 3.7 @Salomon Brothers 7,943.7 20.0 17 2.5 @Conning 5,308.5 13.4 1 0.1 @Lazard Freres 3,460.8 8.7 6 0.9 @PaineWebber 2,001.4 5.0 8 1.2 @Wasserstein Perella 1,566.0 3.9 2 0.3 @TOTAL $39,720.84 683 @*Adds to more than total because all advisers participating in a transaction are credited with the full value @Source: IDD Information Services </TEXT></DOC>
