(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker's attorney and the judgehearing the fraud and conspiracy case against the deposedtelevision evangelist clashed Wednesday over the number ofcharacter witnesses called by the defense.   ``We're not going to sit here the next two or three days andhear the same thing over and over,'' U.S. District Court JudgeRobert Potter told lawyer Harold Bender.   Wednesday's testimony was similar to that presented Tuesday,with ardent supporters of Bakker testifying that they thought hewas a fine man who was underpaid and unjustly accused. The defensewas in its fifth day of trial, with an interruption Friday byHurricane Hugo.   Arnold Santjer, who owns a ship-loading business in Bradenton,Fla., was the 18th ``Lifetime Partner'' in the PTL ministry totestify. He created a stir in the courtroom when he said he owned76 lifetime partnerships costing a total of $76,000. Each $1,000unit entitled the owner to rights to three nights yearly lodging atthe hotel at the PTL theme park.   Asked whether he had any regrets, Santjer said, ``I'm notunhappy. The Lord gave me the money to start with. It was his inthe beginning.''   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller pressed Santjer on crossexamination about his confidence in Bakker's claims that he wouldlimit the number of partnerships to 25,000. The indictment chargeshe sold more than 66,000.   The 6-foot-3, 220-pound Miller pointed to a water pitcher on atable and asked Santjer: ``If Mr. Bakker said he could fit meinside that pitcher, do you believe he could do it?''   ``If he thinks he could, yes,'' Santjer replied.   Bakker is accused of defrauding followers by diverting more than$3.7 million in PTL money to fund his lavish living. He faces up to120 years in prison and more than $5 million in fines if convictedon all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.   Special prosecutor Deborah Smith asked the judge to limit thenumber of character witnesses. After Wednesday's testimony, Ms.Smith said 37 character witnesses had been called.   Potter said his policy is to limit lawyers to five characterwitnesses in a trial.   Bender, however, disagreed that he was calling characterwitnesses.   ``We have not put up anyone for the purpose of specificallybeing a character witness,'' Bender told Potter. ``These are thepartners, judge. People who have put their money into thisministry.''   Potter said the defense was ``invited to put on whatever defenseyou feel is appropriate.'' But he issued the warning: ``I'm notgoing to sit here forever.''   Samuel Sandifer of Wilson said he bought a partnership in 1985.   Ms. Smith asked if he objected to the use of $265,000 inpartnership money to pay church secretary Jessica Hahn for hersilence about a sexual tryst with Bakker in 1980.   ``I have no problem if it was spent on the Heritage Grand,Jessica Hahn or unwed mothers,'' he said. ``It's their money tospend the way they see fit.''</TEXT></DOC>
