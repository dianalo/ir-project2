Before World War II, college educations were rare, especially for women. Only 8% of women now aged 65 and older have completed four or more years of college, compared with 13% of elderly men. By contrast, today's young women (aged 25 to 29) are just as likely to have four or more years of college as young men. Twenty-two percent of both groups have that much education.    Education translates into income, and women's earnings are catching up with men's. In 1970, women who worked full time made 59 cents for every dollar that men earned. By 1987, that ratio had risen to 66 cents per dollar. Young, well-educated women are making the difference. In 1970, women 25 to 34 who worked full time earned only 65% as much as young men. In 1987, young women were making 74% as much as their male counterparts. In contrast, full-time working women in the 55-to-64 age group -- only 11% of whom have attended college for four years or more -- earn 58% of what men of similar age earn.    Education Really Does   Matter in the Job Market   IT'S GETTING tougher for the less-educated to make it in the working world.    Fully 26% of those in the labor force have had at least four years of college education, according to new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Twenty percent have had one to three years of college. That means nearly half of workers aged 25 to 64 in the U.S. have had some college experience. This is up from 37% of like-aged workers with any college education in 1978.    The proportion of the labor force completing its education with a high school diploma has remained the same for the past 10 years, at 40%. What has shrunk is the portion of the labor force that hasn't finished high school -- 15% in 1988 vs. 24% in 1978.    It's also evident from their high labor-force participation that those with a college education are highly motivated to look for work once they're done with school. Eighty-eight percent of people with four or more years of college are working or looking for work. (The labor force includes unemployed people who are actively seeking work.) The participation rate for people with one to three years of college is 83%; for high school graduates, 77%; and for dropouts, only 61%.    Room for Diversity   In Household Definition   TIMES HAVE changed for the American household. In the past, the vast majority were traditional families; now households are fragmented into four major groups.    According to the Census Bureau's 1988 population survey, 28% of households are non-families -- people living alone or with unrelated people. This share is up from 19% in 1970. Non-family households have accounted for half of household growth in the past 18 years.    Most non-family households consist of people living alone, but 4% of all households are &quot;other non-families,&quot; a category that includes unmarried couples and roommates. A majority of non-family households are headed by women, many of them older widows living alone.    Families are still a majority of households, but most aren't the traditional nuclear variety -- married couples with children. These families have declined sharply as a share of all households -- to 27% from 40% in 1970. The single largest household segment in 1988 -- 30% of the total -- is made up of married couples without dependent children in the home. This share hasn't changed since 1970.    The remaining 15% of households are families without a married couple. The majority -- 7.3 million households -- are single-parent families.    ---                   Major Household Types    Married couples without children                30%    Married couples with children                   27%    People living alone                             24%    Other families and non-families                 19%    Source: Census Bureau   Wedding Bells Ringing   Later -- But More Often   YOUNG PEOPLE aren't getting married as soon as they used to, but more people apparently are giving marriage a try during their lives. Currently, for example, just 5% of men and women 65 and older have never been married, down from 8% in 1970.   The median age at first marriage for men is now 25.9 years, up from a 20th century low of 22.5 years in the late '50s, according to a recent Census Bureau survey. Median age at first marriage for women has risen, too, to 23.6 years in 1988, from 20.1 years in 1956. This means that until age 26, a majority of men are still single. And over half of women haven't married by their 23rd birthday.   But by middle age, most people have married at least once. Three-quarters of men 30 to 34 have been married, as have 84% of women in this age group. By age 40 to 44, 92% of men and 94% of women have been married.   But not all those people are still married -- about 20% of people 40 to 44 are separated, widowed or divorced.</TEXT></DOC>
