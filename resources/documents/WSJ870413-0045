At a March 27 hearing, Judge Patrick F. Kelly of the U.S. District Court in Wichita, Kan., approved the payment of about $55 million, or an average of $2,821 a case. He gave Raymark until May 8 to review an additional 9,500 claims.    The payments, to be made from an insurance fund created by Raymark's insurance carriers, are expected to begin in June, the judge said. The fund already has $28.2 million in an escrow account, he said.    Raymark, a Trumbull, Conn., maker of energy absorption and transmission products, and a former asbestos producer, has battled at least 45,000 asbestos suits in the past 10 years. It is one of a number of companies that have been sued by thousands of people claiming they have been exposed to asbestos, a cancer-causing mineral once widely used in building and piping insulation. </TEXT></DOC>
