The IntegratedGas Engine Vapor Compression System concept includes an engine-generatorset and a steam screw compressor mechanically integrated with the engine.The gas-fueled engine is ebulliently cooled, thus allowing its waterjacket heat to be recovered in the form of low-pressure steam. The steamis then compressed by the steam compressor to a higher pressure, andwhen combined with the high-pressure steam generated in the engine'sexhaust gas boiler it provides the end user with a more-usable thermal-energysource.</TEXT></DOC>
