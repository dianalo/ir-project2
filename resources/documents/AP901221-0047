No serious injuries or deaths were reported, but power and waterservice were disrupted in many areas and police reported somelooting, Ken Booth of Guam Cable TV said.   The storm was the strongest to hit this western Pacific islandin more than a decade. Its eye moved within 15 miles of Guam'ssouthern coast early today, and wind hit 135 mph in the south and90 mph with gusts of 115 mph in central and northern areas, saidLt. Diane Edson of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.   Fifteen minor injuries and no deaths were reported, Booth said.   ``It was quite a blow, but not as bad as had been expected,'' hesaid.   Gov. Joseph Ada said about 500 families in the southern town ofAgat were displaced, Booth reported. About 2,500 people soughtshelter during the storm.   Power and water service remained down in many areas, andofficials said it would be three days before full power wasrestored, according to Booth.   Booth said police reported looting in some areas. The duty-freestore in the central town of Tumon reported being robbed of$250,000 in Rolex watches and an undetermined amount of otherjewelry. There were reports of looting in other areas as well. Noarrests were made.   Waves cresting as high as 24 feet caused severe flooding insouthern Guam, uncovering corpses in the cemetery in the town ofInarajan, Booth said.   Several large concrete utility poles installed after the lastmajor typhoon, Pamela in 1976, snapped in half from the force ofthe waves, Booth said.   Russ damaged or destroyed only the few wooden homes remaining onthe island. Concrete structures built after Pamela escaped seriousdamage.   Ada said he planned to ask for federal disaster reliefassistance.   Booth said the capital of Agana looked like a ``war zone,'' withtrees, traffic lights, poles and signs strewn about and floodingeverywhere.   The storm center was out to sea and headed toward thePhilippines with sustained winds of 145 mph and gusts of 175 mph,Edson said. It was moving at 15 mph, but was expected to weakenbefore it reached the Philippines.</TEXT></DOC>
