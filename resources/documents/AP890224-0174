More than 70 percent of the 10.4 million voters in Thursday'sballoting voted in favor of the new constitution, according toresults announced by the Interior Ministry on Friday.   About 80 percent of the North African nation's 13 million voterscast ballots, the ministry said, clearing the way for a multi-partypolitical system for the first time since independence from Francein 1962.   Interior Minister Aboubakr Belkaid said the new constitution willallow his country ``to know more democracy, to assure public andindividual liberties and to establish the sovereignty of the law.''   He said it ``opens the way to a new era'' in multiple-partypolitics.   The new charter continues the political and social reformspromised by President Chadli Bendjedid after a week ofanti-government riots in October left at least 176 people dead.   Parliament in the coming weeks is expected to consider a set ofmeasures governing the operation of political parties and anelectoral code.   Most Algerians welcomed the reforms, but Islamic fundamentalists,who have already begun organizing a political association, hadreservations.   Islamic leader Ali Bel-Hadj said fellow Moslems could not supporta pluralistic system that was in ``conflict with the ideology andcontradicted the beliefs of our people.''   Thursday was the third time in less than four months thatAlgerians were asked to vote. In November, voters approved a set ofpolitical reforms that reduced the influence of the country's singleparty, the National Liberation Front.   In December, about 81 percent of the voters elected Benjedid, 59,to lead the country of 25 million for a third five-year term.   October's violent unrest was blamed on an economy battered byfalling world oil prices. Algeria derives 95 percent of its exportrevenue from oil.   Algerians blamed the centralized, socialist government forfailing to solve the economic problems behind high unemployment, ashortage of goods, inadequate housing and a general decline inliving standards.   Although it does not specifically authorize competing politicalparties, the new constitution declares ``the right to createassociations of a political character,'' and several have alreadybeen formed in anticipation of the reform.   The new constitution also guarantees freedom of expression and,within limits, the right to strike. It restricts the army todefending the ``national independence, the unity and territorialintegrity of the country.''   Under the old charter, the army had a role in ``development ofthe country and the building of socialism.''   The new text does not refer to socialism. The old constitutiondeclared that ``the Algerian state is socialist.''   Islam remains the state religion and Arabic the official language.</TEXT></DOC>
