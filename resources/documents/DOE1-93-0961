If one wishes to avoid serious effectsfrom the increase of CO/sub 2/ and trace gas concentrations in the atmosphere,the anthropogenically produced CO/sub 2/ emission should not increaseby more than about 0.5% per annum. One way out of the dilemma, besidesnuclear power, is the generation of hydrogen based on renewable energies.The conditions for competing are today unequal for a hydrogen industry.Electricity from inexhausted reserves of hydro power and wind power (about10 000 TWh/a) seem to be the first step in generating hydrogen. An essentialrole, however, is played by the cost reductions of photovoltaics as thereis an enormous potential in this field for unusable areas in sunny countries.(orig.)</TEXT></DOC>
