Al Sharpton Behind Bars for 15-Day Sentence</HEAD><HEAD>LaserPhotoNY24 of July 18</HEAD><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Rev. Al Sharpton was behind bars today aspart of his 15-day disorderly conduct sentence for a 1988 ``Day ofOutrage'' protest.   Sharpton and the Rev. Timothy Mitchell were convicted at anon-jury trial before state Supreme Court Justice Phyllis Flug.Charges against 11 others were dismissed.   They surrendered to authorities Wednesday afternoon and weretaken to jail where they were placed in maximum security,protective custody, said Corrections spokeswoman Ruby Ryles.   The protective status isolates them from the general prisonpopulation. Ryles said they were given that status because of theirnotoriety.   Sharpton's 15-day sentence stems from a Jan. 27, 1988 ``Day ofOutrage'' rally during the Howard Beach racial attack trial.Hundreds of protesters brought traffic around La Guardia Airport toa standstill.   With good behavior, the pair could be out in 10 days, Ryles said.</TEXT></DOC>
