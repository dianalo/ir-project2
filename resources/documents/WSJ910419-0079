The momentum generated by the two-month-old coal strikeprompts some political analysts to wonder whether the unrestcould lead to a general strike that could threaten thegovernment. While the Soviet people have a reputation forgreat tolerance of hardship, dissatisfaction is running at anall-time high.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I don't think our people are quite ripe to support ageneral strike,&quot; says Alexei Levinson, an official of theSoviet Center for Public Opinion and Market Research. &quot;Butthe transformation of the mentality of the Soviet people ischanging rapidly, and who knows?&quot;   The miners who are making a wide range of demands -- fromhigher wages to President Mikhail Gorbachev's resignation --began to meet with officials of the Russian republic andappear to have made progress on their desire to break awayfrom Kremlin control. Russian Premier Ivan Silayev announcedthat the republic would take the mines under its jurisdictionand that he would take a proposal to Soviet Prime MinisterValentin Pavlov for implementing this change.   There was no immediate response from the miners or theKremlin.   The nation's largest coal mine at Raspadskaya in WesternSiberia returned to work Wednesday after the Russian republicagreed to take the pit under its jurisdiction and allow theenterprise to become a joint stock company.   Miners advocate less central control over production andwages, and they want fewer of the profits to go to centralgovernment.   Such political issues evidently are important to theminers. Strikers refused to go back to work several weeks agoafter the Kremlin agreed to double their pay and provideadditional social benefits.   The government has claimed that the strike is havingdisastrous effects on the already collapsing Soviet economy.Gross national product is expected to decline by at least 12%this year, according to official forecasts. The officialgovernment news agency Tass predicted this week that if theminers' strike continues, &quot;We shall face a completecollapse.&quot;   Millions of other workers have started to stage strikes,carried out independently, that they claim support theminers' demands. Unlike the mostly political nature of theminers' demands, most of the other strikers are demandingbetter social and economic conditions, including higherwages; abolition of the 5% sales tax; and adoption of incomeindexation laws to compensate for price increases.   Leaders of the federation of Russian Independent TradeUnions, representing 60 million workers in the Russianrepublic, have called a warning strike for April 26 to presssuch economic demands. The strike will last one hour,according to Eugue Arapov, secretary of the union council.   Mr. Arapov described the strike as a warning toauthorities. &quot;Those who are up high, please look down on howwe live,&quot; he said. He added that the strike would proceedeven if the miners decided to return to work.   Reuters reported that workers in the huge Tymen oilfields, which supply 60% of Soviet oil, also are planning tostop work for an hour on April 26. Strike committees inByelorussia, which staged a two-day strike last week overhigher food prices, called a new strike for next week.   Transportation workers in Kiev, in the Ukraine, ended atwo-day strike after receiving government promises to discusstheir demands. Workers in other parts of the Ukraineconducted work stoppages, according to the news agencyInterfax.   Earlier this month, the Ukrainian parliament suspended Mr.Gorbachev's decree that required republics to stop witholdingdeliveries of raw materials and manufactured goods from eachother and the central government. The Kremlin is fighting abattle with many of the 15 republics for the use of suchgoods.   Individual factories and work collectives throughout thecountry have held, or are planning, similar strikes.   The strikes show how defiant people have become toward Mr.Gorbachev. He seems unable, or unwilling, to stop theprotests, thus eliciting criticism from hardline communistswho plead for a restoration of &quot;law and order.&quot; Secretariesof Communist Party committees from 13 cities issued an appealover Tass for &quot;all patriotic forces of the country to attackchaos and disorder.&quot; They didn't specify what measures shouldbe taken, however.</TEXT></DOC>
