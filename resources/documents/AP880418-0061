Over the next 10 years, the world willadd another billion people. Ninety-two percent of that growth istaking place in the poorer nations of the developing world,'' saidthe report released Sunday by the Population Institute.   ``Unless we wake up to the serious damage population pressuresare doing to this planet, we will see a 21st century that couldoffer unprecedented catastrophic consequences,'' said WernerFornos, the group's president.   Fornos said the thinning of Earth's protective ozone shield;heating of the atmosphere by industrial pollutants; waste andpollution of water supplies; loss of soils and forests; extinctionof species; and expansion of deserts ``are all tied directly torapid world population growth.''   He said the United States and other industrialized nationsshould consider forgiving debts of developing nations thatestablish policies to halt environmental destruction and to expandeducational and employment opportunities for women. Birth rates arelower where women have greater economic and social opportunities,Fornos said.   The report drew sharp criticism from Julian Simon, a Universityof Maryland economist, who said that while ``more people mean moreproblems, the history of humanity is a history of surmountingproblems. New solutions leave us better off than if the originalproblems had never arisen. If we had only 1 million people onEarth, we'd still be chasing rabbits and eating berries and roots.''   ``The Population Institute and other doomsayers have been wrongon every single prediction they have made for the past twodecades,'' and people like Fornos ``have no sense of humor'' and``can manufacture scares faster than you can write stories aboutthem'' said Simon, a business administration professor.   ``Contrary to their prophecies, every important human trend hasimproved,'' he said during a telephone interview. ``Life is longer,health is better, all resources have become more available ratherthan less available and in the United States our environment hasbecome cleaner.''   Kingsley Davis, a demographer at Stanford University and theUniversity of Southern California, defended the report, saying,``There's no question in my mind that virtually every environmentalproblem we have is made worse by the fact we have over 5 billionpeople on Earth.''   Fornos labeled Simon's viewpoint ``baloney'' and ``outrageouslyelitist'' because ``when you recognize the next billion people willcome in just nine years, then you understand that competition forfood and resources of this planet will become more intense.''   Fornos said depletion of Earth's ozone layer will increase skincancers and perhaps damage crops and seafoods, while atmosphericheating will raise sea levels and cause crop failures.Deforestation is likely to create more deserts, spur droughts,trigger extinctions and reduce oxygen production, while industrialpollution and human wastes will taint more water supplies, he added.   To stem the environmental damage, Fornos also recommended:   _Researchers should accelerate efforts to develop alternativesto wood, coal and oil as energy sources, because the use of suchfuels spurs deforestation, expansion of deserts and carbon dioxidepollution that warms the atmosphere.   _Industrial nations could provide more financial aid todeveloping countries that try to limit the flow of migrants intopolluted ``mega-cities,'' which often lack adequate sewage andwaste disposal systems.   _Nations that ratified the treaty to reduce emissions ofchlorofluorocarbons _ the refrigerant gases blamed for depletion ofEarth's ozone layer _ should reconvene to move up their 1994deadline for cutting such emissions in half.</TEXT></DOC>
