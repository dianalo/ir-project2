It was the first Cambodian acknowledgment of the loss of Pailin,near the Thai border. Taking the town was the most important KhmerRouge victory since a Vietnamese invasion in December 1978 oustedPol Pot's Khmer Rouge government.   North Vietnam blames China and other supporters of Cambodianguerrillas for an increase in fighting since Vietnamese occupationtroops withdrew late in September, Hanoi's official news agencyreported Wednesday.   The three guerrilla factions fighting the government NorthVietnam installed in Phnom Penh have made significant militarygains since the withdrawal. The Khmer Rouge said it captured Pailinon Oct. 22.   Tea Banh, the defense minister, was quoted as saying in TheNation that government forces retreated from Pailin after threedays of heavy shelling and an assault by thousands of Khmer Rougefighters.   ``It is hard to concentrate large numbers of our troops in onearea, so when the resistance troops moved in, to avoid loss of lifewe retreated,'' it quoted him as saying. The Nation said theinterview was conducted in Phnom Penh, but it did not say when.   Khmer Rouge radio has reported a drive by its forces towardBattambang, a provincial capital east of Pailin. The paper quotedTea Banh as saying Battambang was put under martial law Oct. 26.   A dusk-to-dawn curfew lifted at the beginning of 1989 wasreimposed Monday in Phnom Penh.   Western diplomats and other observers have expressed doubt theCambodia army, described as poorly trained and led, can survivewithout Vietnamese support. Some analysts fear the Khmer Rouge,largest of the guerrilla groups, will return to power by militarymeans.   Hundreds of thousands of Cambodians were killed in the bloodyreign of the Khmer Rouge between April 1975, when the Indochina warended, and the Vietnamese invasion.   The defense minister said the guerrillas were trying to seize asmuch territory as possible to increase their negotiating power, TheNation reported.   Advances by the non-communist forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk,Cambodia's former ruler, also have been reported, but Phnom Penhradio claimed Monday an offensive they began in late September hadbeen stopped.   Hanoi's official Vietnam News Agency, quoting the CommunistParty newspaper Nhan Danh, said China was trying to return theKhmer Rouge to power.   China is the main arms suppliers to Cambodian guerrillas andgives most of its support to the Khmer Rouge.   Vietnam accused China, the United States, Singapore and othercountries of reneging on a commitment to halt arms supplies to theguerrillas after the Vietnamese pullout.   The United States denies supplying weapons, but non-communistguerrillas have said they receive military aid from Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
