In a long-awaited report, the GAO cited three U.S.companies that claimed they lost from $20 million to $1.4billion in sales because they couldn't get criticalelectronic parts from Japanese suppliers. Those partsallegedly were made available to their Japanese competitors.</LP><TEXT>   The congressional watchdog agency report also said a smallU.S. computer concern lost $65 million in sales in 1989,forcing it to abandon the booming laptop market because aJapanese supplier wouldn't sell the company high-qualitydisplays.   The report said that 22 of the 59 U.S. concernsinterviewed gave specific examples of Japanese companiesrejecting orders for state-of-the-art equipment or parts, ordelaying delivery by six months or longer. Such delays couldput U.S. manufacturers at an irreparable disadvantage insupplying quick-moving markets. The products involvedincluded semiconductor-manufacturing equipment, such asoptical steppers and ceramic packaging, as well as computerscreens and computer memories.   Most of the U.S. producers said they didn't believe thatsuch technology-withholding practices violate U.S. laws,according to the report. But they urged stronger policymeasures to reduce U.S. dependency on Japan for criticaltechnologies.   The report noted that most of the U.S. concernsinterviewed by the GAO either had no problems obtainingstate-of-the-art equipment from Japan or couldn't providespecific examples of supply difficulties. Some of thoserespondents said Japanese technology concerns tend to supplytheir largest customers first, whether they are Japanese orAmerican. Others indicated that some of the difficultiescould have been avoided if the U.S. concerns had establishedlong-term relationships with Japanese suppliers or investedin Japanese facilities.   The GAO also interviewed six Japanese suppliers. All ofthose concerns denied they gave preferences to Japanesebuyers over U.S. competitors, according to the report.Several claimed that supply shortages and orders forcustom-designed equipment may have caused some delays indelivery.   Officials of the New York office of the ElectronicIndustries Association of Japan couldn't be reached forcomment last night.   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), chairman of the SenateFinance Committee, said he has asked the Justice Departmentto investigate allegations that some U.S. producers werepressured by Japanese suppliers into buying unwantedsemiconductor devices to obtain other chips that were ingreater demand. Such tie-in sales may violate U.S. antitrustlaws, Sen. Bentsen said in a statement. The GAO conducted its18-month investigation at the request of the Texas lawmaker.   The report didn't identify either the U.S. buyers or theJapanese suppliers, and it didn't recommend policy changes.But Sen. Bentsen said the report contains &quot;compellingevidence&quot; that such alleged practices help Japan &quot;seizesemiconductor and computer markets from American firms.&quot;   U.S. trade officials and intelligence officers affirmedthat Japanese technology-withholding is a &quot;serious and fairlypervasive problem,&quot; the report said. The U.S. officials, whoweren't identified, told the GAO that they had obtained theirinformation directly from a number of U.S. companies.   The complaints cited in the report involved as many as 37Japanese suppliers. There were no similar complaints againstother foreign suppliers.</TEXT></DOC>
