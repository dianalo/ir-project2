Other expressions of support came from members of theconservative Union of the Democratic Center, Argentina's thirdbiggest political party; a Roman Catholic bishop, military figuresand Menem's own Peronist Party.   But human rights groups and leftist politicians and newspapersdenounced Menem for pardoning 39 officers accused of kidnapping,torture and murder in the ``dirty war'' against suspectedsubversives during the 1976-83 military dictatorships.   Thousands of Communist Party pamphlets were distributed saying,``The killers and coup makers of today will be the repressors oftomorrow.''   At least 8,960 suspected leftists were arrested, never seenagain and presumed executed, according to a commission appointed byformer President Raul Alfonsin whose election in 1983 endedmilitary rule. Human rights groups put the total number of victimswho disappeared at 30,000 or more.   Congressman Federico Storani of Alfonsin's Radical Civic Union,second in size behind the Peronists, accused Menem of appeasing thearmed forces ``in case their intervention is necessary'' to quellprotests against his economic policies.   Menem, a 59-year-old former provincial governor, was held underarrest for nearly five years following the March 1976 military coupthat ousted President Isabel Peron. He was elected president lastMay and took office on July 8 amid triple-digit inflation andrising unemployment.   Opponents of the pardons said Menem's action was too much infavor of the military.   ``It is legitimite to desire that society be reconciled withitself. But this is not the way,'' Eduardo Luis Duhalde, directorof the leftist newspaper ``Nuevo Sur,'' wrote in a column.   ``Carlos Saul Menem has committed a grave error ... that in theend may devour him,'' Duhalde wrote. Reconciliation ``can never bebased on forgetfulness ... putting on the same level victims andaggressors, killers and killed, martyrs and hangmen.''   Also pardoned were 174 officers accused of participating inthree rebellions against Alfonsin and three officers _ includingex-army commander and president Leopoldo Galtieri _ who were jailedfor mishandling the 1982 Falklands War with Britain.</TEXT></DOC>
