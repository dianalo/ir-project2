Graham Sherman, 21, had been found guilty of homicide for theshotgun slaying of his wife Michelle, 23, and month-old son Josh asthey slept in their home last November.   The motive for the killings has not been explained.   ``It is a strange message to come from a courtroom that thecrime of homicide can be purged by mental self-punishment. Is thisto be universally applied in Scottish courts?'' Brian Wilson,Scottish spokesman for the opposition Labor Party, said in London.   ``This is a terrible decision,'' said David Evans, a lawmakerfrom the governing Conservative Party.   The judge, Lord Dunpark, told Sherman the sentence was something``I don't anticipate I will ever do ... again. I am going toadmonish you on both charges.''   The judge said the purpose of sentencing is to punish, and todeter others.   ``In my opinion you have punished yourself more than enough bywhat you did,'' the judge said.   ``You will have to live with this for the rest of your life. Youdon't know why you did it. No one has been able to offer anexplanation as to why you did it.''   There was no deterrent value in a prison sentence, the judgesaid, ``for no one in their right mind would have killed withoutreason these two people who were dearest to them in the world.   ``But that's what you did. There's no point in deferringsentence for good behavior. You have no previous convictions.Neither is this a case in which in my opinion a probation orderwould help you. It would just keep reminding you of what you havedone.   ``And the sooner you try to forget this the better. For allthese reasons I admonish you on both these charges and you have mydeep sympathy.''   A letter that Sherman wrote to his sister-in-law, but nevermailed, was read in court.   ``I don't expect forgiveness, nor do I expect anyone tounderstand why. I have gone over it time and time again in my mind,and I still can't find an answer,'' the letter said.   ``If I could turn back time and get rid of this tragedy, then Iwould.   ``You all know that I love Michelle and Josh with all my heart,and believe me I still do. I can't explain the way I feel now.   ``It's all like a terrible nightmare, one which I know I willnever wake up from,'' the letter said.</TEXT></DOC>
