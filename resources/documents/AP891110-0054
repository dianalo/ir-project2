East German authorities opened the crossings and other bordersto the West Thursday after weeks of pro-democracy protests and amass flight of refugees to West Germany.   Today, the East German guard stood shoulder-to-shoulder with aWest Berlin police officer.   Both tried good-naturedly, if unsuccessfully, to control thecrowd of West Berliners who gathered at the checkpoint to greetnewcomers from East Berlin.   Throughout East Berlin, there were reports that border guardswere putting aside their forbidding demeanor in favor of a morefriendly look.</TEXT></DOC>
