The Department has now completedthat administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the TariffAct of 1930, as amended (``the Tariff Act'').<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of the Review</ITAG>Imports covered by this review are shipments of worsted spun acrylic pliedyarn for machine knitting, excluding four-ply craft yarn and certain brushedyarns. During the review period, such merchandise was classifiable underitems 310.5015 and 310.5049 of the Tariff Schedules of the United StatesAnnotated. This merchandise is currently classifiable under the HarmonizedTariff Schedule (``HTS'') item 5509.3200. The HTS item number(s) are providedfor convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.The review covers five manufacturers/exporters of spun acrylic yarn fromItaly and the period April 1, 1986 through March 31, 1987. Only three manufacturers/exporterswith shipments during the period responded adequately to our requests forinformation. Turriddo Torracchi did not respond to our questionnaire. MisterJoe's response to the Department's questionnaire was inadequate becauseit provided self-selected home market sales and did not provide any adjustmentsto U.S. or home market sales. Therefore, the Department used the best informationavailable for these two firms, which was the rate published in the antidumpingduty order (45 FR 23684, April 8, 1980). While the petitioner had requestedthat the Department conduct a review of an additional firm, that firm hadno shipments during the period, and we have no evidence that it is a manufactureror exporter of the subject merchandise.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments Received</ITAG>We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminaryresults. At the request of the petitioner, the American Yarn Spinners Association,Inc., and two respondents, International Fibre Industries Ltd. (``IFI'')and Gruppo Bertrand (a.k.a. Fantasia), we held a hearing on June 8, 1989.We received comments from the petitioner and three respondents.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments</ITAG><T3>Comment 1: </T3>The petitioner argues that the Department erred inbasing the foreign market value (``FMV'') calculations for some of IFI'sUnited States sales on sales to the United Kingdom (``UK'') because thesesales are not of such or similar merchandise. Petitioner contends thatthe type C yarn exported to the UK is substantially different from thetype A and B yarns exported to the United States. First, the typc C yarnis fundamentally different ``in component material''. That is, the typeA and B yarns IFI exported to the United States are both double-ply, 24count, high bulk yarns. By contrast, the type C yarn sold in the UK isa single-ply, 40-count yarn that is not bulked at all. Therefore, the typeC yarn is so fundamentally different from the type A and B yarns that typeC yarn is not even in the class or kind of yarn covered by the antidumpingorder.Second, the type C yarn is used in very different applications. Type Cyarn results in a much lighter knit that is used for the assembly of ``cut-to-sew''fabric parts for slacks and dresses, as opposed to ``knit-to-shape'' sweaterparts for which the type A and B yarns are used.Further, the type D yarn exported to the UK cannot be described reasonablyas ``such or similar'' to the type A and B yarns exported to the UnitedStates. Although type D yarn, like type A and B yarns, is a double-ply,high bulk yarn, type D yarn is a 34 count yarn that is much finer thanthe 24 count type A and B yarns sold to the United States. Unlike the typeA yarn, the type D yarn is dyed, rather than raw white, and is put up onskeins rather than cones.Because of these physical differences, type D yarn has markedly differentuses than type A and B yarns. That is, type A and B are typically usedfor knitting sweaters, whereas type D yarn is used to produce finer knitfabrics.Therefore, petitioner concludes that the Department should not make anythird country comparisons using IFI's sales to the UK. Instead, the Departmentshould use IFI's sales of the comparable type A and A-1 yarns to Spainfor any third country comparisons, and should use constructed value calculationswhen no Spanish sales contemporaneous to the United States sales are available.IFI contends that petitioner's arguments concerning yarn type comparisonsor the ``third country market'' issue are untimely. Further, IFI arguesthe yarn types exported to the UK are such or similar merchandise as definedby law. This is supported by the fact that all yarn types are made with100 percent acrylic fiber. Thus, they are all ``like'' each other in componentmaterial.The component material for both fixed and high bulk yarns is 100 percentacrylic fiber. The fact that type C and type E yarns are single-ply whiletype A, B, and D are double-ply has nothing to do with component material,but rather is the result of the way in which the component material isspun into yarn. Nor does fixed versus high bulk distinguish the yarns interms of component material, because such distinctions are attributableto the way in which the component material is processed by the spinner.IFI further argues that the yarns are ``like'' one another in the purposefor which they are used. All are worsted spun acrylic yarns used for knitting.While different types may result in knitted products of differing weightsor textures, this does not affect the use made of the merchanise, <T3>i.e., </T3>the yarn. In addition, types C and D yarns are such or similarmerchandise, in the same general class or kind as type A and B exportedto the United States, because all are spun acrylic yarns and all are usedfor knitting.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>For the final results of review, the Departmenthas used constructed value as the basis of comparison where we determinedthat the cost differences for type C and D yarns sold to the UK were ofsuch a magnitude as to preclude a reasonable comparison. As the Departmentstated in the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; CertainInternal Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan:<ITAG tagnum="21">[I]t is the Department's practice to disregard home market sales asthe basis for foreign market value when the difference in merchandise adjustmentsclaimed are of such a magnitude as to lead us to question whether the homemarket sales reported can serve as an appropriate measure of foreign marketvalue. There are two basic reasons for this practice: (1) in determiningwhether U.S. sales are being made at less than fair value, we do not wantthe difference in merchandise adjustment either to falsely create dumpingmargins or to mask them; and (2) large difference in merchandise adjustmentsmay indicate that the home market sale is not similar to the U.S. sale,thus, warranting a new comparison (53 FR 12552, 12567, April 15, 1988).</ITAG>Because of the magnitude of the cost differences between the yarns soldin the U.K. (type C and D) and yarns sold in the United States (A andamp;B), we have concluded that the yarns sold in the U.K. are not such or similarmerchandise under section 771(16) of the Tariff Act.Petitioner timely submitted its legal arguments on comparison of merchandisein its pre-hearing brief. However, as we stated above, we used constructedvalue as the basis of comparison where there were signficant cost differences.<T3>Comment 2: </T3>The petitioner argues that the Department should revisethe calculations of IFI's selling, general and administrative (``SGandamp;A'')expenses for the constructed value calculations to use the 10 percent statutoryminimum rather than IFI's actual allocated SGandamp;A expenses, because theactual allocated expenses are slightly lower than the statutory minimum.IFI argues that the petitioner's methodology is incorrect because it wouldresult in an overstatement of general expenses. Further, IFI argues thatthe Department overstated SGandamp;A expenses by computing the expense ona weighted-average basis. Instead, it should be calculated on a contract-by-contractbasis.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Section 773(e)(B)(i) of the Tariff Actstates that the amount for general expenses shall not be less than 10 percentof the cost of the materials and fabrication. Calculated SGandamp;A was lessthan 10 percent. Consequently, for these final results we have used thestatutory minimum.IFI's argument that the Department overstated SGandamp;A expenses by computingthe expense on a weighted-average basis is moot. Even if we had computedSGandamp;A using IFI's method, we would have applied the statutory minimum.<T3>Comment 3: </T3>The petitioner argues that the Department should nothave used the U.S. interest rates to calculate IFI's imputed credit expensesfor third country sales. The Department should have used the applicable``prime'' rate prevailing in the Eurodollar market, the London InterbankOffer Rate, instead of the U.S. prime rates.IFI contends that the Department is correct in using its U.S. interestrates rather than an imputed interest rate in the credit expense calculationsbecause this rate reflects its actual cost of borrowing.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Consistent with current Departmental practice,when computing imputed credit costs, we conclude that it is more reasonableto use IFI's actual short-term borrowing experience rather than a theoreticalrate as suggested by petitioner.<T3>Comment 4: </T3>The petitioner contends that the Department shouldimpute an inventory carrying cost in the constructed value calculationsfor IFI and Gruppo Bertrand. The imputed interest expense should be calculatedon the value of the inventory from the date of production to the date ofsale (<T3>see </T3>All-Terrain Vehicles from Japan, 54 FR 4864, January 31, 1989).IFI argues that it is inappropriate to impute inventory carrying chargesas was done in All-Terrain Vehicles from Japan because that determinationinvolved ESP sales. IFI's sales are purchase price sales.Gruppo Bertrand contends that adding imputed inventory carrying costs mightbe appropriate where such an addition would raise a respondent's actualSGandamp;A expenses above the statutory 10 percent minimum, or where itsSGandamp;A expenses are already higher than the 10 percent level. In GruppoBertrand's case, however, the SGandamp;A expenses are below 10 percent, andthe statutory 10 percent used in the CV calculation can be presumed toinclude any additional hypothetical costs.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>In All-Terrain Vehicles from Japan, anamount representing inventory carrying cost was included in general expenses.However, in this case, we have not made such an adjustment to constructedvalue because for both IFI and Gruppo Bertrand inventory carrying expensesare accounted for in the SGandamp;A as part of the indirect selling expenses.<T3>Comment 5: </T3>The petitioner argues that the Department should verifyIFI's and Gruppo Bertrand's response before the final determination inthis administrative review.IFI contends that the Department effectively has verified its cost of production(``COP'') because IFI has supplied detailed and complete data with supportingdocumentation. It further contends that this review performed by the Departmentwas more thorough than the normal on-site verification because the Departmentexamined all of the cost of production documentation for all contracts.Gruppo Bertrand also requests that we verify prior to the final resultsof our review.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Neither the petitioner nor the respondentGruppo Bertrand made a timely request for verification under section 776(a)of the Tariff Act. These requests were received after publication of thenotice of preliminary results of administrative review. In section 751reviews the Department generally conducts verification prior to publishingthe preliminary results. We do this so that parties to the proceeding willhave access to all information on which our determinations are based inorder that they may make meaningful comments on our preliminary results.In this case, the parties have not shown ``good cause'' for departing fromour general practice.<T3>Comment 6: </T3>IFI argues that the Department made a computationalerror in the calculation of COP for contract S-00820-06 which resultedin an incorrect cost adjustment for differences in merchandise. Ultimately,this computational error created dumping margins on deliveries under thiscontract.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have corrected the computationalerror.<T3>Comment 7: </T3>IFI claims that its third country sales generally weremade in lira. However, nine of the deliveries under contract S-00822-06were invoiced on a split basis, partly in dollars and partly in lira. Incalculating FMV for this contract, the Department did not include the dollarportion of the invoicing on these nine deliveries and, therefore, the datainput error should be corrected for the final results of the review.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Although IFI is correct, this issue ismoot because contract S-00822-06 was not used in our calculation of FMV.<T3>Comment 8: </T3>IFI argues that the Department's conclusion that nodates of sale were provided for Sample A sold to Spain and Sample B soldto the United States, thus warranting the use of best information available(``BIA''), is incorrect. Sample A was filled with yarn produced under acontract for another order. If date of sale must be based on written documentation,then the Department should use October 14, 1986, the date of the invoiceto the customer as the sale date.Sample B was a resale of a yarn sample purchased by IFI. The Departmentincorrectly used the date of the invoice from the yarn producer to IFIas the date of sale.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. The Department requested copiesof the documents associated with all of IFI's sales contracts covered bythe review. IFI failed to substantiate that the reported dates of salefor Sample A and Sample B were correct. Consequently, we used the dateof the purchase order for the fiber as best information available.<T3>Comment 9: </T3>IFI argues that the amount for profit should be calculatedon the basis of the company-wide profit of IFI's yarn sales.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree that the overall company averageprofit should be used in the CV calculation. For the preliminary results,we used the United States profit by yarn type. However, we now believethat using the U.S. profit in the CV calculation would not permit correctcomparison for dumping purposes insofar as U.S. profit would be comparedwith U.S. profit. Therefore, we have for the final results, recalculatedprofit based on third country sales to the UK because we are using suchUK sales as the basis for our FMV determinations where such determinationsare based upon prices. See Strontium Nitrate from Italy; Final Determinationof Sales at Less Than Fair Value, 46 FR 25496 (May 7, 1981). We found thatthe profit sales to the UK was less than the statutory minumum; therefore,we used the statutory minimum of eight percent.<T3>Comment 10: </T3>Gruppo Bertrand argues that the Department erred inusing CV as the basis for foreign market value. The Department's determinationthat its sales in the home market and in France were at prices below itsCOP is entirely attributable to the use of BIA for SGandamp;A expenses. Hadthe Department used the SGandamp;A data supplied by Gruppo Bertrand, mostof the sales in both markets would have been found to be above cost.Further, Gruppo Bertrand argues that the Department's use of BIA for SGandamp;Ais based on unsupported assumptions and misunderstandings as to the natureof the data supplied. The Department's assumption that Gruppo Bertrandsplit manufacturing costs between manufacturing and operating is incorrect.As Gruppo Bertrand explained in its March 13, 1989 letter, it ``independently''determined the overall cost of operating the acrylic yarn activity of thecompany. The figure arrived at was found to represent 50 percent of thetotal manufacturing costs of the company.The petitioner argues that the Department correctly used the BIA for GruppoBertrand's SGandamp;A expenses because Gruppo Bertrand has not addressedthe Department's concern that its method of determining these expensesfailed to include all such properly allocable expenses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department used CV as FMV because wedetermined that Gruppo Bertrand had no sales in its home market or to Franceat or above the COP. The calculation for the COP consisted of the costof materials, labor, and factory overhead as provided by Gruppo Bertrand.For the SGandamp;A expenses, used in both the CV and COP calculations, weused BIA which was the statutory minimum of 10 percent.In reviewing Gruppo Bertrand's allocation of the SGandamp;A expense, we determinedthat the allocation was not supported, nor fully explained. That is, insupport of its reported SGandamp;A expense, Gruppo Bertrand only stated thatit ``* * * first took the overall cost of operating the acrylic yarn activityof the company. This turned out to be 50 percent of the total turnover(manufacturing costs) of the company * * *'' And as Gruppo Bertrand statedabove, ``it independently'' determined the overall cost of operating theacrylic yarn activity of the company.Nowhere in any of Gruppo Bertrand's responses did it provide specific dataconcerning the first allocation in its calculation of SGandamp;A. That is,Gruppo Bertrand never provided values for the first allocation and it neverexplained the origin of the values that were used. As a result, we determinedthat Gruppo Bertrand's calculation of SGandamp;A was inadequate.<T3>Comment 11: </T3>Gruppo Bertrand argues that before resorting to CV,the Department must determine that sales made at less than COP have beenmade over an extended period of time, in substantial quantities, and atprices which do not permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable periodof time in the normal course of trade. Even with the use of a 10 percentBIA for SGandamp;A, the margins by which its sales in Italy and France werebelow the calculated COP were extremely low. Under these circumstances,it is not unreasonable to assume that the prices at which Gruppo Bertrandsold in its home market and to France are such that costs will eventuallybe recovered. Furthermore, in the letter dated February 17, 1989, datawas provided to show that its sales in Italy and France during the reviewperiod were at prices which permit recovery of all costs within a reasonableperiod in the normal course of trade.The petitioner argues that the Department properly disregarded these salesas inadequate, since they were all below cost and were not shown to beat prices that would permit the recovery of all costs within a reasonableperiod of time in the normal course of business.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Gruppo Bertrand's initial questionnaireresponse showed that the costs for the differences in merchandise adjustmentswere greater than some of the unit prices in the home market, which causedus to conclude that there were sales below cost. We then asked Gruppo Bertrandto demonstrate whether or not its prices would permit recovery of all costswithin a reasonable period in the normal course of trade. Gruppo Bertrand'sresponse dated February 17, 1989, simply stated: ``* * * As to your inquiryor (<T3>sic</T3>) capitalization of new equipment or buildings, etc. duringthe period * * * Fantasia responds that there were no such purchases inthat period * * *'' No other explanations or information were providedconcerning recovery of costs which might lead us to conclude that costscould be recouped. Because of Gruppo Bertrand's failure to provide us withinformation indicating that costs could be recouped, we determined thatGruppo Bertrand's costs could not be recouped within a reasonable periodin the normal course of trade. Consequently, we determined that there wereno sales in the home market or to France that were sold at or above itsCOP. Absent sufficient sales in either market to be used as a basis forFMV, we used CV.<T3>Comment 12:</T3> Gruppo Bertrand argues that before resorting to CV,the Department must find that the above-cost sales that remain are inadequateas a basis for the determination of foreign market value.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We determined that no sales were made abovecost. (<T3>See</T3> our position on Comment 11.)<T3>Comment 13: </T3>Gruppo Bertrand argues that the Department misidentifiedExhibit 9 to its original response because the response inadvertently includeda reference to Exhibit 9 (a worksheet for type 2/27/22 yarn and is titled``Cost of Product Bought in Italy (2/27/22)'' and provides two columnsof COP data: The left column is cost data for the yarn dyed and wound oncones, the right column shows cost data for this yarn if not dyed and notwound on cones) at the end of the paragraph discussing duty drawback. Asa result, the Department used the wrong COP to compute the constructedvalue for raw white on hanks yarn sold to the United States because theDepartment did not realize that the right column on Exhibit 9 providesseparate cost data for this yarn type. This was an inadvertent error thatwould have been clarified had there been a verification in this review.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Although the Department did not misidentifyExhibit 9, which is described in the response as a worksheet showing thedifference in the COP on some of the merchandise sold to the United States,we have recalculated the constructed value based on the clarification madeby Gruppo Bertrand. We do not however, that the purpose of verificationis not to correct a response but rather to test its accuracy and completeness.<T3>Comment 14:</T3> Gruppo Bertrand argues that the Department's determinationnot to adjust United States price by the amount of the duty drawback isthe result of the Department's misunderstanding of Exhibit 9. Because ofthe misunderstanding, the Department should allow the addition to U.S.price.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We did not make this adjustment to U.S.price because Gruppo Bertrand did not provide us with the information toenable us to make this adjustment. Gruppo Bertrand did not specify whichsales were entitled to the duty drawback.<T3>Comment 15:</T3> Gruppo Bertrand argues that the Department's determinationnot to allow a circumstance of sale adjustment, on the basis that the currencyhedging proceeds are not directly related to its U.S. sales, is directlyat odds with the decision in Antifriction Bearings (Other than TaperedRoller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany(54 FR 18992, May 3, 1989). This adjustment should be allowed for the finalresults.The petitioner argues that Gruppo Bertrand failed to demonstrate that thecurrency gains were directly related to its United States sales duringthe period.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> In Antifriction Bearings we state thatwe made a circumstance of sale adjustment to reflect hedging profits orlosses accurately, where these profits or losses were properly documentedand were demonstrated to be directly tied to sales during the period ofinvestigation. Gruppo Bertrand has not documented that this claimed adjustmentis directly related to its sales to the United States. Gruppo Bertrand(Cofisa) purchased lira with borrowed U.S. dollars on September 18, 1985,in anticipation of a decline in the value of the dollar vis-a-vis the lira.In the response Gruppo Bertrand identified certain sales with purchasedates from 6 months to 1 year after the date of the currency gain. We concludethat this is mere financial speculation which was not directly tied tothe sales identified in the response. Consequently, we have not allowedthe adjustment.<T3>Comment 16:</T3> Mr. Joe argues that the merchandise sold to the UnitedStates during the period of review is outside the scope of the antidumpingduty order because the yarn is 50 percent natural fibre with very low levelsof synthetic fibre. Therefore, its shipments should be excluded.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Mr. Joe provided an incomplete responseto the Department's questionnaire. As a result, we used BIA. Mr. Joe hadprovided information concerning the fibre content of the yarn for the June8, 1989 hearing. We have rejected this information as untimely becauseit was submitted after the preliminary determination.
