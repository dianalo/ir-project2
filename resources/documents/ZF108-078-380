Schmitt and the NorthWest of Us users grouphave released an updated version of the Virus Encyclopedia, a nicely doneHyperCard stack that catalogs Macintosh viruses and techniques for preventingor removing them.andP;  The latest encyclopedia is dated Dec.andP;  12, 1989, andincludes information on the WDEF virus and variations of the original nVIR.andO;The stack serves well as an introduction to viruses for non-programmers.andP;  Itis available on-line and from Macintosh users groups.andM;We welcome comments at MacWEEK, 4 Cambridge Center, Third Floor, Cambridge,Mass.andP;  02142; (617) 497-2600; (617) 497-2646 (fax).andP;  Electronic mail:CompuServe: (Ric Ford) 75410,2612, (Rick LePage) 76117,1765; GEnie, AmericaOnline, Delphi, PAN: MACWEEKBOS; Connect: RICKLEPAGE, RICFORD; AppleLink:(address to &quot;MacInTouch&quot; in Subject): MACWEEK; Internet:MACWEEKBOSTON@MCIMAIL.COM; MCI Mail: MACWEEKBOSTON.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
