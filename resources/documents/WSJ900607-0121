Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and others takingpart in marathon negotiations on the issue of Quebecprovince's constitutional status said federal and provincialofficials had made progress in the discussions.</LP><TEXT>   Neither Mr. Mulroney nor other officials who spoke woulddivulge details of the private talks in Ottawa, but theirassessment was enough for the market, which bid the Canadiandollar steadily higher through the North American day. Inlate afternoon New York trading, the Canadian dollar was at85.49 U.S. cents, up from 85.03 U.S. cents late Tuesday.   In other dealings, the U.S. dollar rose modestly againstthe mark and yen, but slipped slightly against the pound.   Canada's talks are a last-ditch effort by Mr. Mulroney towin a consensus among Canada's 10 provinces on a proposedconstitutional amendment that would codify French-speakingQuebec's status as a &quot;distinct society&quot; within Canada.   New Brunswick, one of three provinces stubbornly holdingout against the amendment, tentatively agreed Monday toratify the measure. Newfoundland and Manitoba oppose it ongrounds that a liberal interpretation of the &quot;distinctsociety&quot; clause by Quebec might allow Francophone authoritiesto dilute the civil rights of Quebec's sizableEnglish-speaking minority.   Quebec has said it won't tolerate any changes to theamendment and will secede from Canada if it isn't passed. All10 provinces must ratify the measure by June 23 for it tobecome law. The talks have been in session for the past fourdays.   Market participants said there will have to be someresults if the Canadian dollar is to avoid a quickretracement of yesterday's gains. &quot;If there's no news by theend of the week, no change in position,&quot; the Canadiancurrency will fall no matter how evident a &quot;friendly tone&quot;is, said Thomas Benfer, senior marketing representative atBank of Montreal in New York.   In late afternoon New York trading, the U.S. dollar was at1.6885 marks, up from 1.6850 marks late Tuesday, and at152.65 yen, up from 152.45 yen. Sterling was at US$1.6875, upfrom US$1.6870.   In Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was trading at 152.45 yensoon after opening at 152.49 yen; it closed in TokyoWednesday at 152.60 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency wastrading at about 1.6880 marks, down a bit from Wednesday'sTokyo close of 1.6888 marks.   The mark was hurt by reports of possible East German laborunrest in coming days, giving up small gains to the U.S. andJapanese currencies, participants said.   News that owners of small independent businesses in EastGermany have asked their employees to strike in protest ofthe current terms of unification heightened market concernthat the costs of unification could rise.   The small-business owners said they feared being squeezedby the 1-to-1 conversion of East German mark wages andsalaries into West German marks, which will occur at the sametime business accounts are halved by a 2-to-1 exchange rate.   The squeeze could jeopardize as many as 350,000 jobs, onebusiness spokesman said. Groups representing the retail,restaurant and service industries have called for a striketoday in Berlin and a national walkout tomorrow.   Comments late in the day by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspanthat he doesn't see underlying deterioration in the U.S.economy had little effect on the U.S. dollar.   The U.S. currency rose slightly against the yen, as marketconcerns about Japanese inflation and the large amount ofJapanese debt secured by inflated real-estate prices tendedto balance the positive factor of Japan's robust economy,said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp. inMinneapolis.   In Europe, the dollar ended modestly weaker, althoughaction was thin and largely focused on non-dollar activity.In Tokyo, a report that U.S. Federal Reserve officials don'tsupport lower interest rates helped the dollar edge up.   On New York's Commodity Exchange, current-delivery golddropped $2.40 to settle at $357.40 an ounce, the lowest closesince July 30, 1986. Estimated volume was a moderate threemillion ounces.   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $456.25 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
