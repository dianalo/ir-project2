(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Eddie McClary was found dead in twofeet of fermenting mash at a gasohol plant nearly nine years ago,the case was ruled an accidental drowning and his boss collected$50,000 in life insurance.   Now an investigation by the The State newspaper of Columbia hasturned up suggestions that McClary may have been murdered. Amongother things, the newspaper reported a statement by WilliamsburgCounty Sheriff's Deputy Daniel N. Blunt Sr. _ which he has sincedisavowed _ that he had a suspect in the case.   McClary, 23, was found dead March 3, 1980, in a tank at theCarolina Alcohol Co. plant in Kingstree, where he was head chemist.The plant, designed to produce ethanol for an alternative togasoline known as gasohol, was owned by state Rep. B.J. Gordon, alongtime political power in the area.   Although relatives and rescue workers were suspicious, acoroner's inquest ruled the case an accident, and Gordon collected$50,000 from a policy protecting the company against the death of akey employee. The plant later folded and the Farmers HomeAdministration, which backed $420,000 in loans for the project,footed the bill, The State reported in its stories on the casepublished Jan. 1.   Blunt concluded at the time that McClary's death was an accident,as did state and federal authorities. The latter two said the scopeof their investigations was limited by the rulings from localauthorities, The State reported. Blunt told the newspaper his owninvestigation was curtailed because he resigned his deputy's post torun for sheriff, an election he lost.   The newspaper said Gordon testified the next year as a characterwitness for Blunt while the officer was on trial on charges ofofficial corruption, including taking bribes. Blunt was convictedbut pardoned by the state parole board in 1983 and rehired bySheriff Theodore McFarlin, who said he was his best investigator.   According to The State, Blunt told reporters he had always beensuspicious about McClary's death and still had a suspect, althoughhe refused to identify him. ``A lot of things about this case botherme,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.   Specifically, the newspaper said Blunt acknowledged that duringhis investigation he didn't ask how McClary had scaled the10-foot-tall fermentation tank without a ladder, didn't questioncuts and bruises on the body, and didn't try to find out how a grownman could have fallen through a small hatch atop the tank anddrowned in 24 inches of mash.   After the stories appeared in The State, Blunt told The News andCourier of Charleston that he had been misquoted.   ``Ain't nobody murdered that boy. The State reporters asked me ifthere was anything suspicious. I said a lawman's always suspicious.That doesn't mean I suspect murder in this case,'' Blunt told theCharleston paper.   The State's managing editor, Robert Hitt, said the newspaperstood by its story. He said that although the interview with Bluntwas not taped, the two reporters present took extensive notes.   The State said its stories were based on a seven-monthexamination of more than 3,000 pages of state and federal records,some obtained through use of the Freedom of Information Act.   Hugh Munn, a spokesman for the State Law Enforcement Division,said Blunt denied having a suspect when he spoke to agents from hisdepartment last week.   Munn said his agency also questioned several other people ``butthere was no new evidence, so there's nothing more we can do.''   McFarlin, the Williamsburg sheriff, said last week he did notplan to reopen the case. Mark Dillard, a spokesman for stateAttorney General Travis Medlock, said his office had examined thenewspaper's report but found nothing to warrant further action.   Gov. Carroll Campbell said he supported the decision not toofficially reopen the case. ``I have to trust the law enforcementofficials,'' Campbell said.   Tommy Gamble, one of the rescue workers who pulled McClary's bodyfrom the vat, said he was interviewed Tuesday by three lawenforcement division agents. Gamble said he told the agents that hewould ``die and go to hell 40 times before they'd make me believe hedied in an accident.''   Lichi Boggs, McClary's mother, said she remains convinced her sonwas murdered. ``If I had millions of dollars to prove it, I wouldfight it to the end,'' she said.   Gordon, after repeatedly refusing calls and visits by Statereporters, told The Associated Press he has suffered greatly fromMcClary's death.   ``I suffered a lot of pain from that business venture. I sufferedpain from the loss of a friend. ... I feel sorry for people whoforever try to open wounds and bring about pain.''   Gordon gained national attention last year when he and state Sen.Frank McGill filed charges of criminal libel against newspapereditor Jim Fitts. Fitts was arrested and spent a weekend in jailafter he wrote a column critical of the two men. Gordon and McGill,who has since died, later dropped the charges.</TEXT></DOC>
