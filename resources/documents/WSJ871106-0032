Boesky has been granted immunity from federal criminal prosecution, according to people familiar with the government's insider trading investigation.    David Jachimczyk, a former stock trader for Mr. Boesky, is the latest potential witness about the activities of Michael R. Milken, head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk bond operations. The government is investigating a $5.3 million payment from Mr. Boesky to Drexel in March 1986. People familiar with the investigation have alleged that the payment may have been part of an illegal stock trading scheme between Mr. Boesky and Mr. Milken.    Drexel has repeatedly maintained that the $5.3 million fee was for legitimate investment banking services, and Drexel and Mr. Milken have denied any wrongdoing.    Mr. Jachimczyk's lawyer, Frank Wohl, declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office.    Mr. Jachimczyk worked for Michael Davidoff, former head trader for Mr. Boesky, who earlier this year pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud, settled related Securities and Exchange Commission charges, and is cooperating with the government. The government has previously obtained the cooperation of four of the most important participants in the events culminating in the $5.3 million payment, including Mr. Davidoff. People familiar with the investigation said Mr. Jachimczyk kept extensive records of certain trades Mr. Boesky's firm conducted with Drexel. </TEXT></DOC>
