The AD supersedes the requirements ofAD 88-24-14, Amendment 39-6033 (53 FR 45895; November 15, 1988), by establishinga reduced cyclic life for fuel manifolds installed on GE CF6-80C2 engines,and removing the requirement for a one time inspection.

Since publication of AD 88-24-14, a fuel manifoldin revenue service developed a leak within the service life establishedby AD 88-24-14. Investigation results indicated that the leak was froma crack which initiated as a result of low cycle fatigue (LCF) of the fueldmanifold tube. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determinedthat this condition is likely to exist or develop on other engines of thesame type design. Therefore, this AD supersedes the requirements of AirworthinessDirective (AD) 88-24-14, Amendment 39-6033 (53 FR 45894; November 15, 1988),and establishes a reduced cyclic life limit for the affected fuel manifolds,and provides a schedule for removal from service of GE CF6-80C2 fuel manifolds,to prevent fuel leaks resulting from LCF cracking.This AD also removes the requirement for a one time inspection which wasimposed by AD 88-24-14. The original intent of this inspection was to aidin the definition and control of potentially unsafe conditions. Based onthe results of inspections, revised fuel manifold manufacturing processes,revised fuel manifold installation procedures, and reduced fuel manifoldcyclic life established by this AD, the FAA has concluded that continuedinspections are not required to maintain a satisfactory level of safety.Therefore, this AD removes the requirement for the one time inspectionof the fuel manifold and the fuel manifold supports which was establishedby AD 88-24-14.Since it was found that immediate corrective action was required, noticeand public procedure thereon were impracticable and contrary to the publicinterest, and good cause existed to make the AD effective immediately byindividual telegrams, issued February 1, 1989, to all known U.S. ownersand operators of certain GE CF6-80C2 series turbofan engines. These conditionsstill exist, and the AD is hereby published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> as an amendment to andSection; 39.13 of Part 39of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) to make it effective as to allpersons.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationthat is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291. It is impracticablefor the agency to follow the procedures of Executive Order 12291 with respectto this rule since the rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafecondition in aircraft. It has been further determined that this actioninvolves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If this action is subsequently determinedto involve a significant/major regulation, a final regulatory evalautionor analysis, as appropriate, will be prepared and placed in the regulatorydocket (otherwise, an evaluation or analysis is not required).
