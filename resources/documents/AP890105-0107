One of the three remained under arrest in the eastern city ofNanking, apparently facing trial, while two others were beingpunished with 15 days of ``disciplinary detention,'' the Xinhua NewsAgency said.   A fourth African was released and returned to his school Thursdaynight, the report said.   In related developments, about 45 African students held 10 daysat a guesthouse following the brawl returned to their university inNanking on Thursday.   In Hangzhou, about 150 miles to the southeast, African studentsended a 10-day class boycott after their college's president agreedto give them a direct telephone line and write an open letter sayingnone had AIDS.   One African country warned it might recall its students becauseof the treatment of African students.   Besides Hangzhou and Nanking, racial incidents have occurred inBeijing and Wuhan, an industrial city in central China.   The incidents began Dec. 24 in Nanking, when African studentsrefused to register their Chinese girlfriends to attend a dance atHehai University. The disagreement led to a fight and nearly a weekof anti-African protests by Chinese youths.   Xinhua said Alex Dosoo of Ghana beat and seriously hurt auniversity worker during the brawl. He was the only African to bearrested.   The news agency said Alpha Robinson of Gambia and Dossoumou BoniLodovic of Benin ``tried to stir up trouble'' during the fight andwere being given 15 days detention under China's public orderregulations. All three admitted they broke the law, it said withoutelaborating.   The four were among about 140 students, most from Africa, whotried to flee to Beijing in the face of the Chinese protests butwere taken by police to a guest house outside Nanking and heldincommunicado.   The four were taken into custody Saturday at the guest house byabout 400 police who, according to fellow students and Africandiplomats, used electric cattle prods and wooden clubs. Chineseofficials deny any violence was used.   Police brought most of the other students back to Nanking but 45remained at the guest house until Thursday, when they returned toschool voluntarily in order to meet with a group of Africandiplomats.   Hehai students said Thursday that hundreds more paramilitarypolice had flooded the guest house Sunday.   ``Police were everywhere, in the building, in the corridors, onthe landings, in the lounges and on some balconies,'' said CarlAmeho of Ghana.   He said students were prohibited from making telephone calls andcould only go outside to walk to the dining hall.   ``It was a real jail,'' Ameho said.   Some students said that on their first day back at HehaiUniversity, Chinese students yelled: ``Black devil, you'vereturned!'' and ``Black devil, get lost!''   ``We are still very scared here,'' said a student from Gambia.``Today I rode outside the university and came home quickly becauseso many people were calling me a `black devil,''' he said.   Ameho said Liang Ruiju, Hehai's president, met with Africanstudents and told them that under the university's new regulations,Africans must introduce their Chinese girlfriends to universityofficials.   Chinese women can lose their jobs or be subjected to ridicule ifthey openly have relationships with foreign men.   In Hangzhou, a conflict at Zhejiang Agricultural College wasresolved with authorities making concessions to the African studentsfor the first time.   African students said the trouble in Hangzhou began when Chinesetelephone operators told Chinese callers that all the Africans hadAIDS. The university has denied the allegation.   In Beijing on Thursday, African students at the Beijing LanguagesInstitute continued a class boycott triggered by Chinese allegationsthat a black student accosted a Chinese woman in her room.   In Wuhan, the Hubei province foreign affairs office acknowledgedthat Chinese students threw rocks at foreign student dormitorieslast week. It said a Sri Lankan student at Central ChinaPolytechnical College was injured by glass from a broken window Dec.29.   In Ghana, the state-run radio station reported that thegovernment may recall the 26 Ghanian students soudying in China.   Diplomats from Ghana and Benin said China's handling of theincidents could damage Sino-African ties.   ``The way this is going this could lead to something verynasty,'' said a diplomat from Benin.   China denies all charges of racial prejudice, and expresses prideat its long-established policy of showing solidarity with the ThirdWorld by giving scholarships to African students. There are about1,500 African students from 40 nations now in China.   Africans complain that they are subject to racial discrimination,and social contacts between African men and Chinese women are afrequent source of tension.   Chinese also resent the fact that Africans, many from countriesas poor as China, receive far better food and lodging than Chinesestudents.</TEXT></DOC>
