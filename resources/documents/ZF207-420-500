Dvorak state opposing positions withrespect to the usefulness of home computers.andP;  Seymour owns severalIBM Personal Computers.andP;  He is disparaging of the term 'homecomputer,' however, because it perpetuates outmoded notions of PCuse, such as using the machines as a recipe database or runningaddress labels.andP;  Seymour does view the PC as an important tool forextending the workday, for use as game machines and as educationaltools for children.andP;  Dvorak believes the home computer is a luxurythat can enhance the quality of life, without requiring loftybusiness goals to justify its presence.andP;  Dvorak and his family usea computer to divert the kids from television, for personalcorrespondence, to maintain a recipe database, for scanning and toeliminate paper clutter.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     MicrocomputersApplicationsAttitudeTerminology.andO;Feature:   illustrationportrait.andO;Caption:   Jim Seymour.

DVORAKandM;I like the idea of having a computer at home.andP;  In fact, I have several.andP;  ButI wish we could get away from the term &quot;home computer.&quot;andP;  It's misleading, andit perpetuates some out-moded notions about how people use PCs in theirhomes.andM;How about calling them just ...andP;  computers?andM;Otherwise, we get caught up in trying to decode the ridiculous taxonomy ofeducational computers, household computers, game computers, work-at-homecomputers.andP;  That harks back to the seventies, when we saw endless stories ingeneral-circulation magazines about all the wondrous things we'd be doing injust a year or two with computers in our homes.andP;  Imagine these ridiculousscenarios:andM;Mom could use one in the kitchen, for example.andP;  She'd keep all her recipes inan easy-to-use database.andP;  She'd first convert them all to the rightquantities of ingredients to serve four, then key them in.andP;  Later, when shewas making yummy Kraft ChickenMagic for company, and Dad called to say therewould be eight, not four, for dinner, she could just tell the computer toautomatically increase the measures.andP;  She wouldn't have to worry about how tomultiply a cup-and-a-half of flour times two; the computer would do it forher!andM;And at Christmastime she could run off lots and lots of cute little addresslabels for the family's Christmas cards on the very same computer.andM;And Junior would surely be using one for his homework.andP;  He could write wssayson his educational computer, and draw nice pictures to put on the covers ofhis book reports, and look up facts about faraway places in the computer'smemory, and maybe even learn what to do with all those pesky xs and ys inalgebra!andM;When Junior wasn't using the machine, Sis would use it, too, to work on herFrench lessons.andP;  She could write term papers and even get help with thosenasty footnotes and bibliographies.andP;  Later, she could hold little Louie onher lap in front of the very same computer and help him learn his alphabet.andO;They'd use one of those swell flash-card programs on that educationalcomputer and Louie would become so much smarter than all the other littleboys and girls at nursery school.andM;Dad?andP;  Well, Dad wouldn't have to spend so many long nights at the officeanymore.andP;  He could just sit down after dinner in front of his work-at-homecomputer, dial in to the Big Computer at the office, and get right to work onwhatever it is that daddies do all day.andM;Excuse me, but I don't know any families like that, or anyone who usescomputers that way, or anyone who would want to do these things.andP;  It's notjust that that kind of thinking is silly, sexist, and seventies; it's that itmakes both more and less of the role of computers in the home than isactually necessary or realistic.andM;The dominant use of IBM-style PCs in the home today is as &quot;workdayextenders.&quot;andP;  Whether that after-hours work is for our employers, forourselves, or for volunteer organizations, work-at-home PCs have becomeimportant tools for millions of us.andM;The second most common use of DOS computers in the home is as game machines.andO;I'm not a big fan of computer games, though I've been known to spend a fewminutes wrestling with Tetris or jousting with Alex Trebek in Jeopardy.andM;Finally, PCs are used as educational tools for our children.andP;  There stillisn't much good educational software for PCs--and considering how bad most ofthe stuff for Apples and other educational computers is, maybe I don't needto qualify that with &quot;for PCs.&quot;andP;  But as primitive as most educationalsoftware is, computers can provide a useful secondary or tertiary channel forour kids' desire to learn about the world around them.andM;Soon educational software won't be only for our kids.andP;  I'm convinced that themost underused role of PCs is that of running computer simulations, which arenothing more than educational games for adults--a powerful crossruff betweentwo existing uses.andP;  When simulations come into wider use, the entire family'sgoing to be in there fighting to get at the PC.andM;So a computer--and, increasingly, more than one computer--has plenty of usesin the home.andP;  Why then, John, don't we drop that demeaning &quot;home computer&quot;tag, with its Atari 400 connotations, and let computers just be computers?andO;Period.andM;Sure, Jim, you can shroud it in a semantic argument and bury it withridiculous examples, but face it, the home computer is anything but dead.andM;You forget that the whole notion of a home computer is what got the desktopcomputer scene started in the first place.andP;  When Apple Computer rolled outits early ads for the Apple II, it was billed as a home computer.andP;  It's notthat it could do that much at home.andP;  Heck, it couldn't do anything at theoffice either.andP;  Then VisiCalc came along, designed by some college kid namedDan Bricklin and marketed by another young guy, Dan Fylstra.andM;The scene shifted radically as bean counters discovered the value of the homecomputer.andP;  Pretty soon the home computer became a business computer, and nowpeople who should know better tell us that the home computer has no usebeyond letting &quot;Dad&quot; spend as much time working at home as he does working atthe office.andM;The way home computer-haters talk, you get the impression that if somethingisnht used for business, if it can't be cost-justified, if it doesn't makeyour workday more productive, then it ain't worth having.andP;  Meanwhile, theyoverlook all the quality-of-life issues.andP;  You see, a home computer is not abusiness computer you have at home.andP;  You can use it that way, but its bestuse is for things other than business.andM;It's like an automobile.andP;  A car is not a cost-effective thing to own.andP;  Itisnht in use all the time, for one thing, and it can't possibly pay foritself.andP;  But we still have cars for quality of life--convenience, not profit.andM;The home isn't run a a profit center, and the home computer can't be expectedto pay out in two years, either.andP;  In fact, a home is a luxury, and as aluxury we can't demand too much from it.andM;We can expect it to entertain and inform kids with games and educationalsoftware.andP;  Sure, Nintendo is better than any desktop computer, but a home PCseparates a television from game playing, and that's got to be a good thingfor kids--and for parents.andP;  It's also great for teaching typing--and kidsthese days had better learn to type.andP;  And despite what you'd have us believe,not all educational software is junk; more and more good PC-based learningtools are becoming available at reasonable prices.andP;  If you have kids, youneed a home computer.andM;I use mine for personal correspondence and to manage my Rolodex.andP;  It's anexpensive Rolodex, and an expensive typewriter, too.andP;  But I can afford it,and I prefer it over my old Olivetti.andP;  I can't imagine anyone who can afforda home computer and printer choosing a typewriter instead.andM;And make fun of &quot;Mom&quot; and her recipes.andP;  I once did, too.andP;  But recently, I'vediscovered the joys of scanning and the world of optical characterrecognition.andP;  I recant those years I ridiculed using a home computer to storerecipes.andP;  Now I can actually get rid of that box of clippings I've beenlugging from abode to abode over the decades.andM;It's a minor thing, and surely an extravagant use for such equipment, but,again, I'm talking about quality of life.andP;  If I can eliminate the scraps ofpaper that fill drawers and clutter counters and find what I need when I needit, I've put the machine to good use.andM;Most people keep a computer at home for these same &quot;quality of life&quot; reasons,but they won't admit it.andP;  There's always some phony business excuse.andP;  &quot;It'sso I can work on my budget at home.&quot;andP;  They probably lease their BMWs and keepcareful logs of their phone calls and do all sorts of drone-like things tomaintain a lifestyle that looks good from the outside.andP;  Probably half of all&quot;home computers&quot; are actually &quot;computers at home&quot; owned by guys like that.andM;Meanwhile, I'll use my home computer for personal reasons.andP;  I'll play gameson it and keep personal notes on it.andP;  I'll let the family use it for whoknows what.andP;  I'll use it to make invitations and announcements and even scanrecipes.andP;  I'll use it to practice poker, or to call CompuServe or GEnie.andO;Maybe I'll even use it to do my income taxes--but I doubt it.andM;If I don't use it for anything else, who cares?andP;  If I don't boot it for anentire month, so what?andP;  And as for getting my money's worth from the thing,it's not any more important than getting my money's worth out of a pair ofslacks or a new TV.andM;There is no quality-of-life line on the ledger, my friend.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
