The proposal is expected to include deficit cuts of $45billion to $50 billion in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct 1.The heart of the new proposal will probably be a stiff $17billion cut in projected spending on so-called entitlementprograms, such as Medicare and farm programs, for whichspending is set by a formula. That's about $5 billion deeperthan the cuts proposed in President Bush's January budget.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, the administration is likely to propose a cutof about $3.5 billion in suggested discretionary spending ondomestic programs -- the same cut recommended in the planapproved by the Senate Budget Committee in May. And it isexpected to propose $20 billion in new revenue and user fees,most of which were in the president's January budget.   The proposal will also call for a somewhat largerreduction in defense spending than the $3.2 billion cut thepresident has supported.   The administration previously proposed a $36.5 billiondeficit-reduction package, and Democratic leaders have beencalling on President Bush to make a new budget proposal forweeks. The administration's new proposal is certain to beunacceptable to the Democrats because it relies mostly ondomestic-spending cuts.   But Democrats face a delicate decision on how to respond.Some may favor using Mr. Darman's new proposal as a startingpoint for negotiations; others may want to attack the plan aslittle more than posturing.   In talks yesterday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told thesummit that cutting military forces 25% over the next fiveyears won't reduce spending much below the levels outlined inMr. Bush's January budget. Democrats, who see sharp cuts inPentagon spending as a key to shrinking the federal budgetdeficit, quickly noted that Mr. Cheney's latest figuresassume no cuts in research and development and only minimalchanges in the Pentagon's procurement plans.   Rep. Les Aspin (D., Wis.) and Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.),chairmen of the Armed Services committees, said Mr. Cheney'spresentation didn't advance the talks. Any new Bushadministration proposal on defense spending will come only aspart of a broader deficit-reduction proposal, Rep. Aspinpredicted.   Although the details are far from settled, cuttingmilitary forces by 25% is emerging as a consensus position.Mr. Cheney tried to convince Democrats that it would take fardeeper and more disruptive cuts to reduce the Pentagon budgetas much as they envision. Judging from the reaction ofDemocratic negotiators, he didn't succeed.   Mr. Cheney said such a force reduction would trim about10% from the projected defense budget, adjusted forinflation, over the next five years. But Rep. Aspin insisted,&quot;If you cut forces by 25%, you get a lot more than 10%savings.&quot; A more reasonable figure, he suggested, is in the&quot;low 20%&quot; area.   Mr. Cheney's figures, made available by congressionalnegotiators, show that a 25% force reduction would bringdefense outlays in fiscal 1991 to $302 billion, about $1.3billion lower than Mr. Bush's January budget and about a $5billion cut from projected levels. For reasons that weren'timmediately clear, Mr. Cheney said the Pentagon budget infiscal 1995 actually would be slightly larger than the oneMr. Bush proposed in January.   Over the next five years, Mr. Cheney said that cuttingforces 25% would save $102.9 billion from projections thatassume the defense budget keeps pace with inflation. That's$8.6 billion less than the spending outlined in the Bushbudget.   Mr. Cheney said the force reduction might mean cutting thenumber of active-duty troops by 442,000 over five years to1.6 million and eliminating 450 of the 950 Minutemanmissiles, four of the 21 strategic bomber squadrons and 111of the Navy's 566 ships.   Separately, advocates of a constitutional amendment toforce a balanced federal budget managed to have the measuresent to a vote on the House floor. Led by Rep. CharlesStenholm (D., Texas), the backers obtained the 218 signaturesneeded to move the amendment from the Judiciary Committeeonto the House floor. A House vote on the measure is expectedby July 26.   Two-thirds of the 435-member chamber would have to approveit and send it to the Senate. Advocates say 248 memberssupport discharging the amendment this year, which would be39 votes short of the 287 needed.   The measure would require that federal spending not behigher than expected federal receipts except during wartimeor when three-fifths of both houses of Congress approves abudget deficit.</TEXT></DOC>
