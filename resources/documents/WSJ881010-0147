It is sometimes used to refer to &quot;decision-making rights&quot; and at other times to mean &quot;where the children live.&quot; Most of your examples referred to equal time sharing.    A mother and father who both want to be actively involved in their children's lives are very reluctant to give up any of their rights in decision making and are increasingly agreeing to joint-managing conservatorship or custody. They continue to share in making major decisions about their children; however, it doesn't mean the children have to spend equal time with each parent. In working out arrangements that are in the best interest of the children as to where they will spend their time, many factors are taken into consideration.    As a professional working with divorcing couples, I have seen all types of unusual arrangements work. It all depends on the people involved. It's vitally important that parents remain flexible and creative in working out arrangements for the children so that the &quot;restructured&quot; family situation will allow all members to lead happy and productive lives in which they can feel good about themselves and their interactions with others.
