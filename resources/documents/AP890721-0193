MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With liberals flocking to support a lawagainst flag burning, Robert H. Bork said, smiling, it might standup in the Supreme Court for lack of lawyers to challenge it.   He was joking, of course. Bork, the conservative whose SupremeCourt nomination was rejected by the Senate, believes that it willtake a constitutional amendment to reverse the court ruling thatpermits flag burning in the name of free speech.   As lawyers and legislators choose sides on flag measures, notmany are saying that the best thing to do is nothing. The issue isso flammable that just about everybody wants action, or thinks itinevitable.   That's the point behind Bork's banter at a House hearing theother day. The question has become whether to ban flag desecrationby act of Congress, or by amendment to the Constitution, ratherthan whether it is necessary or desirable to do either.   One exception: Charles Fried, another conservative scholar, andsolicitor general in the Reagan administration. Fried said Congressshould show leadership by forgoing any action, statute oramendment. He said no American should be punished for even the mostoffensive and bizarre expressions of dissent.   But Fried is a Harvard University law professor, not apolitician. One way or another, Congress is going to vote to undothe court ruling. In the Senate, there are to be votes on bothoptions _ an amendment and a statute. House Republicans want thesame thing. ``We deserve a straight up or down vote on the floor onthe ... amendment,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the GOP whip.   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House panel thatheard a week of testimony on the flag controversy, said he thinksFried's counsel was sound, ``but it's such a loser.''   He's siding with the people who say there ought to be a law, notan amendment. Edwards acknowledged that many lawyers agree withBork that the court ruling on a constitutional issue cannot beundone by statute. ``On our side we have just as many distinguishedlawyers who say that a statute will work,'' Edwards told Bork.   The former appeals judge smiled.   ``All of the people who might have been hired to challenge thatstatute have now testified that it's constutitional,'' he said.``So I suppose the statute might stand for that reason.''   The court ruled 5-4 that burning the flag is a constitutionallyprotected form of dissent. Bork said the decision was ``plainlywrong.''   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who holds the seat Bork was deniedby the Senate in 1987, voted with the majority that overturned aTexas statute banning flag burning.   Congress will decide in the fall what to do about it. PresidentBush advocates a constitutional amendment. Democrats are not goingto risk inaction. The alternative to an amendment is a statuteredrawn so as to flatly forbid desecration, without mentioning thatflag burning is offensive to others, which is what the Texas lawsaid.   Bork says that won't suffice.   On the other side of the debate stood an old foe, Laurence H.Tribe, a constitutional lawyer who testified against Bork's SupremeCourt nomination before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Bork issaid to have shunned joint appearances ever since.   Tribe spoke at the House flag burning hearing on Tuesday, a daybefore Bork testified, and said a constitutional amendment would bepointless folly.   ``On its 200th birthday, the Bill of Rights deserves a betterpresent than a confusing and needless amendment,'' Tribe told theHouse hearing. He argues that the court did not grant a right todesecrate the flag, but ``required that government protection ofthe flag be separated from government suppression of detestedviews.'' Tribe said a flag desecration law written and enforcedwithout regard to any message would be upheld.   Bork said it would be idle and dangerous to try to reverse aconstitutional ruling by passing a new law. ``The matter cannot becured by statute,'' he said.   One way or another, there is an attempted cure coming, althoughthere has been little discussion of the ailment. Sen. RobertKerrey, D-Neb., who won the Medal of Honor in Vietnam, noted thatlack.   ``There simply is no line of Americans outside this building orin this nation queuing up to burn our flag,'' he told the Senate.``On the face of the evidence at hand, it seems to me that there isno need for us to do anything.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
