In 2 years of negotiation with Hydro-Quebec,the utility has refused to correct the problem known as stray voltage.The shocks measure about 10 volts. It has been estimated the averageQuebec dairy farmer with 40 cows is losing $15,000 to $20,000/y in reducedmilk production. About 4,000 of the 23,000 Quebec pig and dairy farmsare bothered by stray voltage. Hydro-Quebec has been asked to installfilters that would reduce the problem; however, Hydro-Quebec attributesthe stray voltage to the farmers' own equipment. A study conducted bythe provincial Agriculture Department that measured stray voltage on700 farms showed that 70% of the problem was Hydro-Quebec equipment.Farmers are prepared to solve the remaining 30% themselves.</TEXT></DOC>
