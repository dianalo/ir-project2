Estimations of quantities describing fluctuationsof shower dimensions such as variation coefficient of a part of IL alongad perpendicular to the shower axis, spread mean square, and variationsof average longitudinal and transversal shower dimensions are obtained.7 refs.; 5 figs.; 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
