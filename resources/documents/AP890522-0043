Prosecutors said the two received donations and highlydiscounted stock shares from the Recruit Co. in exchange for usingtheir political clout to help the company's magazine publishingbusiness.   Charged were Takao Fujinami, 56, a former Cabinet minister andmember of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, and KatsuyaIkeda, 52, former secretary general of the opposition Komeito, orClean Government Party. They were not taken into custody.   The bribery charge carries a seven-year prison sentence.   Before today, 14 bureaucrats and businessmen had been charged inthe scandal, which has eroded public trust in politics.   Last month, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said he would resignto take responsibility. The Liberal Democrats still are searchingfor a successor; most of the party's senior members have beenlinked to the scandal.   Prosecutors questioned Fujinami and Ikeda several times lastweek, and their homes and offices were searched on Thursday.   Ikeda, a former journalist and four-term member of Parliament'slower house, said in a statement today that the charges ``are notthe truth. They are a fabrication of reality.''   Fujinami said today that he would resign from the governingparty, Kyodo News Service reported. Ikeda announced last week hewould resign from Komeito and Parliament.   Fujinami, the chief government spokesman in former PrimeMinister Yasuhiro Nakasone's Cabinet and an eight-term member ofthe lower house, was widely considered a rising star among LiberalDemocrats.   He has acknowledged that an aide bought 12,000 shares of stockin a Recruit subsidiary at discounted prices in 1986 and thenprofited by about $215,000 when the stock was listed for publictrading and rose rapidly in value. Fujinami used a portion of theprofit to buy a house in Tokyo, according to news reports.   Fujinami, a former labor minister, also reportedly receivedabout $640,000 in political donations from the company.   Ikeda has admitted that his brother bought 5,000 shares of stockin the Recruit subsidiary and profited by about $70,000. Ikedaallegedly received $100,000 in donations from Recruit.   Both politicians have denied personal involvement in the stocktransactions.   Prosecutors say profits from the transactions were deposited inthe politicians' bank accounts.   They say Ikeda and Fujinami used their political influence topersuade government officials to continue a ``gentlemen'sagreement'' among government agencies and private companies on auniform date for the hiring of graduating college students. Recruitbelieved the agreement was crucial for the sale of its employmentmagazines, prosecutors say.   Prosecutors now have completed the bribery investigation in thescandal and now will focus on illegal political donations made byRecruit, an information services and publishing conglomerate, newsreports said.   Japanese law limits the amount of money that companies candonate to politicians. A company the size of Recruit is restrictedto about $110,000 in political donations a year.   Prime Minister Takeshita has acknowledged that he received about$1 million in donations from Recruit betweeb 1985 and 1987.   The Liberal Democrats last week agreed to the opposition'sdemand that Nakasone testify before Parliament about any links hemay have to Recruit. He is expected to testify on Thursday.</TEXT></DOC>
