Most economists expect a distinct slowing in profit increases in coming months, and some even predict declines.    &quot;Year-to-year gains in corporate earnings may already have peaked,&quot; says Jack W. Lavery, director of research and economics at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. Holding that economic growth is likely to drop to only 2% to 2.5% in the rest of this year, he predicts that the upshot will be smaller profit gains. He adds that &quot;profit margins will probably narrow as unit labor costs start to rise in relation to prices.&quot;    In the three months ended March 31, after-tax earnings on continuing operations of 509 major corporations climbed 21% from a year earlier, a Wall Street Journal survey finds. The 24% rise in net income was significantly smaller than the 51% surge in the 1987 fourth quarter and also trailed the 33% gain in the third period.    Even though the profit gains have narrowed, they were spread across a wide range of industrial groups.    The survey shows clearly the strong rebounds being achieved in some long-ailing sectors. The steel industry, aided by import quotas, the weak dollar and capacity reductions, chalked up its best quarter since 1979. Swinging into the black from losses in the 1987 first period were such groups as industrial and farm equipment, oil-field services and heavy construction.    Other groups are simply booming. Chemicals and forest products were among those helped by the weak dollar. Aluminum and copper companies turned in huge profit gains from the 1987 first quarter. Airlines flew back into the black, but with a tail wind of promotional gimmicks that may eventually buffet them. The office gear and computer group and the oil companies were strong, although not all of the concerns posted gains.    Lower tax rates significantly aided a number of industrial groups, including food products, grocery chains, hospital companies and soaps and cosmetics. In addition, much of the aerospace industry's profit gain was attributable to tax-related accounting adjustments.    Some industrial sectors' profit totals were strongly affected by one-time items. Railroads prospered, but their profit increase was ballooned by one carrier's gain on asset sales. The media and entertainment group posted a big increase, with one-time items playing a major role.    But the electrical-equipment group was pulled down by General Electric's accounting change in the 1987 first quarter, and banks' total net income was hurt by a huge loss at one Texas institution. Faring poorly were the thrifts and securities firms.    Looking ahead, Stephen S. Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., says, &quot;The bulk of the recovery in profits clearly is now behind us.&quot; He sees after-tax profits rising only 3% this year, less than half the 1987 gain. And peering farther down the road, Mr. Roach expects a profit drop in 1989, along with a recession.    Christopher Caton, an economist at Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass., economic-consulting firm, predicts a profit decline, though no recession, as early as this year. He puts 1988 after-tax profits at $126.8 billion, down from $137.4 billion in 1987. He attributes his &quot;somewhat gloomy&quot; forecast partly to &quot;weak&quot; productivity growth driving up labor costs.    Here are the first-quarter profits for various industry groups and comparisons with the year-earlier quarter. When individual companies report for three-month periods other than calendar quarters, the nearest comparable periods are used. In all the tables, 000s have been omitted.    AEROSPACE   Many companies posted higher net income, although much of the overall profit rise was due to gains from accounting adjustments related to deferred taxes under government contracts. Excluding such gains, Northrop's net was $4.5 million rather than $139.6 million. General Dynamics recorded a $20 million tax gain; Rockwell had one of $49 million related to its B1-B bomber contract. Net at Rohr, Lockheed and Boeing also benefited from lower taxes. Among special items, McDonnell Douglas had a $21 million pretax gain from conversion of an aircraft lease and a $66 million charge for an early-retirement program. United Technologies had a pretax gain of $156 million from asset sales and a pretax restructuring charge of $148.8 million. Textron's charges totaled $29.7 million. Northrop's profit was reduced $20.4 million for settlement of a dispute with the government, $12.7 million for dissolution of a partnership and $28.5 million for unusual interest expense. Analysts say operating profits varied widely in the industry. Fairchild's margins were improving after the sale of most of its aircraft businesses, General Dynamics' earnings were relatively flat, and McDonnell Douglas was hurt by its MD-80 commercial-jet problems. Paul Nisbet of Prudential-Bache Securities says the companies should report fewer write-downs this year, explaining: &quot;They have generally learned to cope with the changes in {government} contracting.&quot;                                    1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    14 Firms                         1988      1987     Chg    Boeing Co                      136,000   118,000   + 15    Fairchild Inds                   5,388     3,341   + 61    GenCorp                         17,000    17,000      0    General Dynamics               105,700   105,400      0    Grumman Corp                    21,027    57,852   - 64    Lockheed Corp                  114,000    86,000   + 33    Martin Marietta                 50,948    44,060   + 16    McDonnell Doug                  51,200    43,000   + 19    Northrop Corp                  139,600    40,600   +244    Rockwell Int'l                 218,400   175,600   + 24    Rohr Industries                  7,628     8,313   -  8    Sundstrand Corp                 15,002    17,019   - 12    Textron Inc                     38,700    60,200   - 36    United Technol                 122,200    98,200   + 24    TOTAL                        1,042,793   874,585   + 19   AIRLINES   The quarter began with carriers worried about a possible downturn in consumer spending but ended with them worried that too many customers may have responded to their frequent-flier promotions. Traffic grew an estimated 6%; in the 1987 first quarter, by contrast, the industry boosted traffic through fare-cutting. The result of the triple-mileage promotions: financial gains purchased at unknown expense in future periods, when airlines will give out thousands of free tickets to customers displacing paying passengers or traveling for free rather than paying for their seats. However, demand may be higher then. Timothy Petee, a Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. analyst, recently predicted 7% traffic growth in the second quarter and 9% to 10% in the third. Some carriers' first-quarter results were affected by one-time items. Allegis, United's parent, posted a $548.5 million gain from sale of its Westin Hotels unit; its year-earlier results included $27.9 million of income from discontinued operations. Delta Air Lines attributed its profit surge to its growing route system, the acquisition of Western Airlines and fare increases. The net loss at NWA, Northwest Airlines' parent, included a $10 million write-down of accounts receivable from a travel wholesaler. TWA had a $10.4 million gain from a depreciation-accounting change but said its results didn't reflect unrealized gains of $340 million from its securities portfolio, nearly $220 million of which occurred in the first quarter.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    9 Firms                          1988      1987     Chg -    Allegis Corp                   576,857   -30,544    ...

APPAREL   Apparel companies, still smarting from weak retail sales, reported flat earnings. Liz Claiborne, with a 5% gain from the year-earlier quarter, says the continuing difficulties in retailing will result in lower earnings during the rest of 1988. Reebok's 24% gain was aided by three acquisitions, but the company complained that profit margins are depressed by &quot;substantial&quot; increases in raw-material costs, higher labor costs at overseas suppliers and the weak dollar. Oxford Industries blamed its loss on a $7.5 million restructuring charge. Hartmarx was hurt by higher interest expense related to its stock buy-back, lower earnings in its specialty stores and start-up costs in one apparel group. VF Corp. Chairman Lawrence Pugh predicts a record year for his company but warns that &quot;it will not be an easy year for companies in the consumer-apparel business.&quot;                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    10 Firms                        1988       1987     Chg    Brown Group                     15,441    13,843   + 12    Genesco Inc                      7,439    15,283   - 51    Hartmarx Corp                    8,825    11,105   - 21    Liz Claiborne                   33,835    32,181   +  5    Munsingwear Inc                   -190       571    ...

Ford Motor blamed rebates for the lower first-quarter profit on its U.S. operations. But its earnings overseas doubled to a record $580 million, and Ford chalked up the highest quarterly net income in auto-industry history. General Motors also suffered from the first-quarter price war as well as lower sales. But the nation's largest auto maker pulled out an 18% gain in net income by instituting its fifth favorable accounting change in two years. Without the extraordinary gain, its net would have dropped 6% from a year earlier to $867.9 million. Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca says his company made a &quot;conscious decision&quot; to &quot;sacrifice profits for a higher market share.&quot; Using incentives and price cuts, Chrysler did lift its share, but its net fell because of a write-off for plant closings. Paccar and Mack Trucks posted solid earnings, aided by strong demand for heavy trucks. Analysts say the heavy-truck industry should remain strong in the second quarter as manufacturers try to fill orders. Domestic auto makers also should do well because they have increased production to replenish depleted inventories.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    13 Firms                         1988      1987     Chg    Champion Spk Plg                 7,300     7,000   +  4    Chrysler Corp                  183,700   269,400   - 32    Cummins Engine                   7,461    14,305   - 48    Dana Corp                       35,100    46,100   - 24    Echlin                          12,426    11,784   +  5    Ford Motor                   1,623,200 1,491,600   +  9    Fruehauf Corp                  -16,372   -10,834    ...

The Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods index of the 150 largest banks showed a 9% median increase in net income. At many large banks, cost-cutting began to lift earnings. Non-interest income continued to grow. Banks reduced their additions to loan-loss reserves, which were huge last year. However, growth in interest income was damped by anemic demand for commercial and industrial loans and by the nonpayment of interest on Brazilian loans. Some banks' earnings were reduced somewhat by new accounting rules for loan fees and deferred taxes. Strong performers among money-center banks were First Chicago Corp. and Chase Manhattan Corp. For the rest of the year, analysts generally expect stronger earnings growth than in the first quarter. Provisions for loan-loss reserves and domestic nonperforming assets should continue to decline, and interest payments from Brazil are expected to bolster third-quarter earnings. Banks in the Midwest, where the economy is rebounding, are likely to be among the best performers this year.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    26 Firms                         1988     1987      Chg    Bank of Boston                  84,300    70,800   + 19    Bank of New England             66,200    59,900   + 11    Bank of New York                54,352    47,282   + 15    BankAmerica                    109,000    67,000   + 63    Bankers Trust                  126,000   124,200   +  1    Barnett Banks Fla               53,600    46,200   + 16    Chase Manhttn                  277,000   104,000   +166    Chemical NY                    125,500    86,200   + 46    Citicorp                       358,000   267,000   + 34    Cont'l Illinois                 68,500    43,100   + 59    First Bank System               34,900    57,400   - 39    First Chicago Corp             141,500    63,857   +122    First Interstate               102,562    80,542   + 27    First RepublicBank          -1,501,700    10,400    ...

Pepsi's domestic unit shipments grew 6.5%, against Coca-Cola's 5% and 4.5% for the soft-drink industry overall. PepsiCo's profit was strong despite a $14.5 million pretax restructuring charge. Coca-Cola's sales grew a solid 9% in key overseas markets, buoyed by the continuing consolidation of its bottling operations and by the weak dollar. General Cinema's earnings included a $21.2 million pretax gain from sale of RJR Nabisco preferred stock. Powered by its flagship Budweiser brand, Anheuser-Busch's volume rose 5%, compared with beer-industry growth of about 0.5% in the quarter. &quot;Anheuser is in the process of eating up the competition,&quot; Mr. Goldman says. Coor's earnings were hurt by a charge for a reserve set up for a court judgment relating to a wholesaler's lawsuit. Although the company didn't disclose the size of the reserve, analysts put it at $3 million to $4 million before taxes.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    6 Firms                          1988      1987     Chg    Anheuser-Busch                 152,383   128,067   + 19    Brown-Forman Inc                28,577    21,606   + 32    Coca-Cola Co                   210,538   185,448   + 14    Coors (Adolph)                   3,717     6,979   - 47    General Cinema                  27,994    15,869   + 76    PepsiCo Inc                    113,300    68,900   + 64    TOTAL                          536,509   426,869   + 26   BUILDING MATERIALS   Results varied widely. Guy Nielsen, a Brown Brothers Harriman analyst, says how companies fared &quot;depended on the product mix.&quot; Prices for many materials, such as wallboard, plywood and lumber, declined. Demand was reduced by poor weather in much of the country, especially early in the quarter; in addition, many year-to-year comparisons were off because the 1987 winter was mild. Cement prices, which had been slumping, recovered late in the quarter, according to Timothy Jones of Oppenheimer andamp; Co. In general, analysts say, companies concentrating on new homes had weak quarters, and those with business in repairs, remodeling and furniture production, such as Armstrong, fared better. Mr. Nielsen notes that repair and remodeling aren't as affected by weather as new construction. Analysts see housing activity flat to higher in the second quarter compared with a year ago but say it will largely depend on interest rates. Among special items, Ideal's latest quarter included an accounting-change gain of $15.6 million. In the 1987 first quarter, Lone Star had a $17.1 million credit from accounting changes, and Owens-Corning had an $83 million gain on asset sales.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    12 Firms                         1988      1987     Chg    Armstrong World                 39,000    31,900   + 22    Ideal Basic Inds                 3,036   -10,948    ...

Even chemical companies that don't sell much abroad find their profit margins widened by pressure on U.S. production capacity. The industry is expecting a strong second quarter, though prices of some petrochemical feedstocks are higher now than a year ago. Producers say they are better able to weather any economic downturn because they have become leaner since the early 1980s. Du Pont's net was aided by $40 million of nonrecurring gains. B.F. Goodrich's net surged, aided by sharply higher sales of polyvinyl chloride and a $9.7 million tax benefit. At Hercules, year-earlier net was ballooned by an $84.4 million gain due to the sale of stock by a joint venture. W.R. Grace also posted lower net; in the 1987 period, it had $27.6 million of earnings from discontinued operations and an $8.5 million gain from a tax benefit. Engelhard had a $10.8 million year-earlier gain on the sale of its interest in a Japanese company.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    23 Firms                         1988      1987     Chg    Air Pdts andamp; Chem                 55,733    41,072   + 36    American Cyanamid               79,200    61,500   + 29    Dow Chemical                   507,000   246,000   +106    Du Pont Co                     590,000   391,000   + 51    Engelhard Corp                  13,415    24,344   - 45    Ethyl Corp                      53,064    46,355   + 14    Goodrich B F Co                 34,700     3,800   +813    Grace W R                       38,305    47,767   - 20    Hanna M A Co                    13,082     7,583   + 73    Hercules Inc                    39,800   132,100   - 70    Int'l Min andamp; Chm                  9,300    18,600   - 50    Koppers Co                      -8,500    -3,000    ...

Neil Sweig, a Prudential-Bache analyst, says drug prices rose about 9% in the first quarter, partly offsetting sluggishness in unit sales. He notes that Pfizer's sales climbed 16%, with half that rise from currency gains and price increases. Squibb's sales also were buoyed by currency gains and its popular anti-hypertension drug Capoten. Marion gained on sales of its heart drug Cardizem. Merck and Schering-Plough benefited from a raft of new products. But Robins was hurt by costs associated with its Chapter 11 plan and merger with American Home. Analysts expect industry profits to moderate for the rest of 1988.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    15 Firms                         1988      1987     Chg    Abbott Labs                    172,094   141,596   + 22    Am Home Pdts                   237,058   216,472   + 10    Bristol-Myers                  210,641   173,880   + 21    Eli Lilly andamp; Co                 233,200   205,200   + 14    Johnson andamp; Johnson              279,000   235,000   + 19    Marion Labs                     39,351    25,523   + 54    Merck andamp; Co                     271,400   201,300   + 35    Pfizer Inc                     219,800   192,000   + 14    Robins A H Co                   14,116    26,010   - 46    Rorer Group                      8,371     7,434   + 13    Schering-Plough                101,500    84,900   + 20    SmithKline Beckman             166,500   146,400   + 14    Squibb Corp                     90,900    69,400   + 31    Syntex                          80,300    67,400   + 19    Upjohn Co                       95,439    80,851   + 18    TOTAL                        2,219,670 1,873,366   + 18   ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT   Most companies posted stronger earnings, though an accounting change at General Electric skewed the group's overall performance. The change magnified GE's year-earlier net income; as a result, this year's earnings fell. Excluding the adjustment, GE's profit more than doubled, to $725 million from $319 million. Similarly, Baldor Electric reported lower net because of a year-earlier accounting change. Zenith Electronics' slight profit compared with year-earlier net that was magnified by income from the sale of land. Texas Instruments' profit drop, however, was softened by inclusion in the latest quarter of about $42 million of what analysts consider unusual income. &quot;The industry trend is definitely strong,&quot; says Paul Johnson, a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. analyst. &quot;A lot of people are talking about an acceleration of business since the first of the year.&quot;                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    31 Firms                         1988      1987     Chg    AMP Inc                         77,603    54,140   + 43    Arrow Electronics                6,051     3,508   + 72    AVX Corp                         5,698     3,445   + 65    Baldor Electric                  2,127     4,658   - 54    Cooper Indust                   32,223    27,591   + 17    CTS Corp                         3,501     1,971   + 78    Cubic Corp                       2,295     2,042   + 12    Emerson Electric               132,600   115,400   + 15    General Electric               725,000 1,177,000   - 38    General Instrument              19,380   -90,497    ...

Its big loss reflected restructuring write-offs, primarily for restaurants. The company's foods sector also lost money, partly because of lower sales and higher marketing costs. Among the many gainers, General Mills' profit was increased by a 5% rise in domestic packaged-food volume, especially seafoods, yogurt, dinner mixes and a new line of hot oatmeal cereals. Quaker Oats attributed much of its earnings increase to gains by hot cereals, Gatorade, dog foods and toys. Kraft's operating earnings also rose even though lower lettuce production wilted salad-dressing sales; its year-earlier profit was ballooned by a tax-accounting change that added $45.2 million to net income. Similarly, International Multifoods posted higher profits on continuing operations, but the year-earlier quarter included a $34.9 million gain from sale of its consumer-food line. Currency translations helped several companies, including Sara Lee and CPC International. Lower tax rates also aided many concerns; Campbell Soup saved $7 million. Excluding losses from its poultry line, ConAgra's profit surged.

Some companies reported record earnings. Weyerhaeuser's net was damped by downturns in its lumber and mortgage-banking and residential-development operations. Louisiana-Pacific posted a hefty 89% increase in operating income, before aftertax gains totaling $161.7 million from a legal settlement and sale of a unit sent net income skyward. Mead's profit includes an $11.2 million gain from sale of an operation. Among special items in the year-earlier period, Georgia-Pacific had a $6 million pretax gain from redemption of stock, and International Paper a $14 million pretax gain from sale of securities. The pulp and paper markets are expected to continue strong at least through year-end. Lumber prices have softened slightly as housing starts eased, but they are likely to stay relatively stable in coming months.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    18 Firms                         1988      1987     Chg    Boise Cascade                   68,540    40,150   + 71    Bowater Inc                     37,974    11,813   +221    Champion Int'l                 101,974    55,468   + 84    Federal Paper Board             21,868    10,934   +100    Fort Howard                     36,296    23,866   + 52    Georgia-Pacific                106,000    80,000   + 32    Great Northern Nekoosa          78,300    43,300   + 81    Int'l Paper                    159,000    90,000   + 77    James River Cp                  49,213    41,691   + 18    Kimberly-Clark                  93,300    75,100   + 24    Louisiana-Pacific              192,500    16,300  +1081    Mead Corp                       65,800    34,200   + 92    Potlatch Corp                   26,495    17,786   + 49    Scott Paper                     74,000    49,000   + 51    Union Camp                      67,554    44,197   + 53    Westvaco Corp                   37,644    19,495   + 93    Weyerhaeuser Co                114,193   101,917   + 12    Willamette Inds                 40,376    22,947   + 76    TOTAL                        1,371,027   778,164   + 76 -   GROCERY CHAINS   Lower tax rates are helping boost net income at many chains. So is the recent absence of significant labor strife and price wars, both of which periodically damage industry earnings. Kroger's operating income topped that in the year-earlier period, when net was increased by a $63.3 million after-tax gain from an accounting adjustment. Stop andamp; Shop posted a big gain because year-earlier earnings were reduced by a $12.1 million loss from discontinued operations. Giant Food attributed its surge in earnings to cost-cutting and higher sales from an expansion program. Winn-Dixie said its earnings &quot;continued below expectations&quot; because of disappointing sales and trouble in controlling expenses, but it expects improvement from a just-completed staff reduction and an anticipated continuation of a sales upturn that began late in the period.

Net income surged, mainly because of lower tax rates, even though margins continue to be squeezed by higher labor costs and only modest increases in Medicare reimbursements. John Hindelong, a Smith Barney, Harris Upham analyst, expects pretax operating profit to increase 5% to 10% for the year. Charter Medical's profit fell 19%, reflecting a $9 million aftertax charge for expenses related to its agreement to be acquired by a management-led group. American Medical International had a $20.4 million gain from sale of a 35% interest in its British operations, offset by a $20 million reserve for losses related to the closure and sale of several U.S. hospitals. Hospital-supply companies continue to be helped by the weak dollar's effect on overseas sales. However, Beverly Enterprises, a nursing-home operator, is still suffering from heavy debt, lower occupancy rates and higher labor costs.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    9 Firms                          1988      1987     Chg    Amer Medical Intl               24,127    27,986   - 14    Bausch andamp; Lomb                   16,604    14,165   + 17    Baxter Travenol                 91,000    66,000   + 38    Becton Dickinson                39,214    36,480   +  7    Beverly Enterpr                   -952     9,980    ...

But &quot;the biggest surprise,&quot; First Boston analyst Deborah Thielsch says, &quot;is that there were no negative surprises.&quot; None of the companies took special charges in the first quarter, a strong signal that the industry-wide restructuring is ending. Among nonrecurring items a year earlier, Foster Wheeler's profit included a $9.4 million gain from pension-plan settlements. The companies have successfully diversified; Foster Wheeler, for example, made nearly all its first-quarter profit from real-estate transactions. And most backlogs have big earnings potential. &quot;Things will be modestly better in the second quarter,&quot; says Andrew Silver of DLJ Securities. &quot;The second half and 1989 will be markedly improved.&quot;                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    6 Firms                          1988      1987     Chg    Ameron Inc                         370      -515    ...

HOME BUILDERS   Home builders posted mixed results. Strong demand in California continues to push new-home sales through the roof, and Northeast sales remain strong. But the rest of the country saw declines from last year's robust sales despite low interest rates. Analysts expect rising rates to hold down sales for the rest of the year. In Los Angeles, Kaufman andamp; Broad said orders increased 28%, while the average new-home price rose more than 10%. At Ryland Group, of Columbia, Md., a 9% increase in home-building earnings was wiped out by a 35% profit drop in its mortgage unit due to lower origination fees and a $1 million gain in 1987 from mortgage sales. Sales also declined at U.S. Home, which scaled back home building in the hard-hit oil patch states of Texas and Colorado. Aided by cost cutting, the Houston-based builder posted its first profit in two quarters. -                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    3 Firms                          1988      1987     Chg    Kaufman andamp; Broad                  7,035     4,678   + 50    Ryland Group                     5,584     6,144   -  9    U S Home                           711     3,121   - 77    TOTAL                           13,330    13,943   -  4    INDUSTRIAL andamp; FARM GEAR   The weak dollar and increased demand for machinery and other capital goods continued to help the group. &quot;All of the trends that occurred in the first quarter should continue to benefit these companies throughout the year,&quot; says John McGinty, a First Boston Corp. analyst. &quot;It should be a very good year.&quot; Special items affected many companies. Deere's net included a $28.7 million gain from new tax-accounting rules; the year-earlier loss reflected a strike. Caterpillar also swung well into the black with the aid of a 42% sales gain; a year earlier, it had nonrecurring charges totaling $49 million. AM International's fiscal second quarter was hurt by a $1.6 million loss from reversal of a tax-loss carry-forward; a year earlier, the company had a $2.2 million gain. Ametek's latest quarter benefited from a $3.6 million gain from an accounting adjustment. Colt had a $7.7 million gain from the sale of a unit but also a $2.5 million pretax charge. Federal Mogul's earnings were hurt by a $1.8 million charge from debt retirement. In the year-earlier period, Ingersoll-Rand posted a $9.8 million accounting-change gain, and Clark Equipment had a $10 million pretax gain from the sale of certain businesses.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    13 Firms                         1988      1987     Chg    AM International                -3,131     2,669    ...

Transamerica had record operating profit, partly because of big gains in its finance, commercial-lending and insurance activities -- a trend it expects to continue for the year. Nonrecurring gains in 1987 were largely responsible for a big drop in net income. At Chubb, tax benefits relating to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 sharply boosted operating profit in the latest quarter; premiums also increased. Aetna's operating earnings sank 30% as earnings on employee-benefit insurance programs slumped and personal auto insurance results were disappointing. Travelers' earnings from operations fell 17%. Property-casualty commercial business and individual life and health insurance and annuities were strong, but profits were hurt by a decline in employee-benefit insurance lines and certain non-earning real estate and mortgage-loan investments. At Fireman's Fund, net premiums written tumbled along with operating earnings. The company noted, however, that it had a large capital gain and a pension-plan gain last year.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    18 Firms                         1988      1987     Chg    Aetna Life andamp; Cas               131,500   221,400   - 41    Amer Int'l Group               300,437   233,967   + 28    American General               117,482   152,707   - 23    Chubb Corp                     102,500    87,300   + 17    CIGNA Corp                      71,000   175,000   - 59    CNA Financial                  175,969    95,017   + 85    Continental Corp                87,000   124,700   - 30    Fireman's Fund Corp             63,970   208,891   - 69    General Re Corp                137,400   129,700   +  6    Home Group                      22,100    74,100   - 70    Kemper Corp                     55,296    81,312   - 32    Lincoln Nat Corp                53,600   105,700   - 49    Marsh andamp; McLennan                94,100    92,900   +  1    Safeco Corp                     74,690    91,769   - 19    St Paul Cos                     91,380    95,308   -  4    Transamerica Cp                 76,594   111,021   - 31    Travelers Corp                  71,200   142,500   - 50    U S F andamp; G                       29,759     3,625   +721    TOTAL                        1,755,977 2,226,917   - 21    MEDIA andamp; ENTERTAINMENT   First-quarter profits surged, but many of the gains resulted from one-time items. The Oct. 19 stock-market crash, which provoked fears about the economy's health, clipped ad revenues, and analysts expect that problem to linger on at least a few more months. Capital Cities/ABC's earnings were fueled by accounting changes, and the company said the outlook for the rest of the year &quot;isn't as encouraging.&quot; CBS's strong earnings resulted from the sale of its records business to Sony. Washington Post's net included a large gain from sale of its Florida cellular-telephone operations, and Gannett had a gain from the sale of its Cowles media stock. Dow Jones, which reported a big gain from the sale of its book-publishing subsidiary, said revenue from its business publications declined because of weaker financial advertising. Grolier's profit was held down by costs of merging with Hachette, and MCA was hurt by a surge in interest expense to $15.5 million from $2.7 million a year earlier. Meredith's year-earlier net was ballooned by a gain from sale of a TV station.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    19 Firms                         1988      1987     Chg    Cap Cities/ABC                  70,345    23,926   +194    CBS Inc                        911,300    48,700  +1771    Chris-Craft Inds                 2,595    -3,526    ...

Earnings tripled at copper companies and more than doubled at aluminum producers, and further gains are expected. Analysts say copper prices rose partly because the AIDS epidemic is afflicting labor at copper mines in Zambia and Zaire. Moreover, Chile and Peru can't obtain capital to expand capacity. And U.S. and Australian producers, expecting copper prices to slide sooner or later, aren't willing to add much capacity. William Siedenburg, a Smith Barney, Harris Upham analyst, expects copper prices to slip next year, after a period of inventory replenishing. He also sees some softening in aluminum-ingot prices in the third quarter, given the 4.5% first-period drop in U.S. copper demand. But the aluminum outlook is excellent. Prices of can sheet -- the biggest volume product at Alcoa and Reynolds -- probably will rise again, effective in July. As long as ingot prices stay high -- they hit records in the first quarter -- mill-product prices will continue strong.                                  1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    10 Firms                         1988      1987     Chg    Aluminum Co Am                 178,700    49,500   +261    Amax                            82,300   120,300   - 32    Asarco Inc                      46,193   -21,279    ...

Minicomputer companies, however, generally posted mediocre quarters, and office-equipment makers had mixed results. Overseas markets continued stronger than the U.S. International Business Machines, which accounted for almost half of the group's earnings, benefited in particular from mainframe sales. In the first quarter, it announced important software for the machines. Digital Equipment was the biggest casualty in the minicomputer market; it had to talk down analysts' earnings estimates twice during the quarter. Wang's earnings nearly quadrupled only because the 1987 quarter, which followed two quarters of losses, had been so weak. Among office-equipment companies, Xerox's earnings rose because of strength in its financial-services operations and a year-earlier charge. The March 31 period's trends are expected to continue in the current quarter, though some people wonder how long the personal-computer market can show the growth that let Apple and Compaq earnings more than double.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    17 Firms                         1988      1987     Chg    Amdahl Corp                     43,163    25,236   + 71    Apple Computer                  79,660    33,866   +135    Compaq Computer                 46,846    20,160   +132    Control Data                     7,700     7,200   +  7    Cray Research                   26,391    57,230   - 54    Data General                    17,200   -42,600    ...

Further severe cost-cutting and consolidation is largely responsible, and rising prices for many services and equipment have also helped. Although many companies say the worst is behind them, few are predicting any sharp increases in profits anytime soon. In spite of continuing cost-cutting, prices of crude oil and natural gas will determine how far and how quickly the companies recover; they are far more dependent on these prices than their customers are.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    4 Firms                          1988      1987     Chg    Baker-Hughes                     8,513  -163,923    ...

PETROLEUM   Major oil companies recorded sharp profit increases, sparked by record chemical operations and strong refining and marketing margins. But a drop in crude-oil prices from a year earlier kept exploration and production profits flat. An exception to the big gains was Amerada Hess; the company, largely a refiner, sells most of its gasoline in the commodity market rather than at retail, where margins are higher. Profits for refiners with many service stations, such as Ashland, surged. Unocal reported a $456 million gain from an accounting change, partly offset by a $322 million charge from asset write-downs. So far in the second quarter, the industry's profit gains seem to be continuing. Demand for petrochemicals remains strong. Company officials say refining and marketing margins are even higher than in the first quarter, and gasoline demand normally picks up this time of year. The main unknown remains the price of oil, but, absent a plunge, gains in the other sectors are expected to offset any weakness there.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    21 Firms                         1988      1987     Chg    Amerada Hess                    65,635   181,472   - 64    American Petrofina              30,429    19,829   + 53    Amoco Corp                     469,000   260,000   + 80    Ashland Oil Inc                 20,577       712  +2790    Atlantic Richfield             401,000   239,000   + 68    Chevron Corp                   653,000   361,000   + 81    Crown Central P                    409   -15,242    ...

Most companies benefited from higher volumes and prices due to cold weather. Panhandle Eastern's profit included $64.3 million from a securities transaction; its 18% drop in pipeline earnings primarily resulted from regulatory orders removing sole-supplier status for one pipeline and certain minimum bills for both. Transco and Enron both restated 1987 results for an income-tax adjustment. Transco's year-earlier quarter included an $81.2 million charge for settling disputed gas contracts. Enron's year-earlier net included $14.5 million from its discontinued oil-trading unit, while the latest quarter had a $6.1 million charge for retiring debt. Texas Eastern reported a sharp drop in net and noted higher operating expenses in the 1988 quarter, which also had an $11.6 million gain from settlement of a rate case; a year earlier, it had $12.4 million of special gains. In April, gas prices plunged, and Coastal, for one, plans to hold production off the market for a while.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    6 Firms                          1988      1987     Chg    Coastal Corp                    46,500    44,100   +  5    Consol Nat Gas                 124,122   105,072   + 18    Enron Corp                      69,400    62,700   + 11    Panhandle Eastn                106,938    41,867   +155    Texas Eastn Corp                32,900    56,200   - 41    Transco Energy                   7,160   -68,830    ...

Rail operating earnings benefited from strong traffic in some commodities: grain shipments, up 26%; metal products, up 30%, and coal, up 6.3%. Auto shipments fell 6.8%, however. Cost-cutting also aided earnings. Excluding a year-earlier gain from sale of stock, Norfolk Southern's earnings from operations rose 29%, reflecting strong traffic and work-force reductions. CSX's earnings from operations fell 23%, as lower real-estate and energy profits more than offset gains in transportation; a year earlier, CSX had a $294 million charge from an accounting change. After falling for several years, rail-freight rates are being pushed up by shortages of some types of rail-freight cars and an easing of truck competition.

Apparel continued to be the weakest category, slashing profits for some apparel specialists. Stacy Ruchlamer of Shearson Lehman Hutton predicts that the once-highflying Limited chain will report sharply lower earnings. Thomas Tashjian of Seidler Amdec Securities says 26 of the 38 retailers that his firm follows are likely to report lower profits, six may post flat earnings and only six are likely to have gains. Wal-Mart, Woolworth and Toys R Us are generally expected to be among those reporting increases. Sears, a retailing and financial-services giant operating on a calendar year, already reported a 38% decline in first-quarter earnings; profits at the company's merchandise group, the nation's largest retailer, fell 40%. Most analysts expect flat or lower earnings at Zayre, Dayton Hudson, May Department Stores, K mart and Nordstrom, which spent heavily to open its first store in the Washington, D.C., area.

With investors still wary of stocks, retail stock volume was off as much as a third in the first quarter, and institutional volume also dropped. However, several sectors showed surprising strength. Mergers and acquisitions provided a big shot in the arm to Morgan Stanley and American Express's Shearson Lehman Hutton unit. Profits from risk arbitrage-investing in takeover stocks -- and a bond-market rally in February -- helped many firms. But First Boston's earnings were hurt by a pretax loss of about $50 million from trading mortgage securities. American Express's earnings would have been about flat without a year-earlier $49 million gain from an accounting change. Analysts aren't very hopeful about second-quarter prospects. Stephen Schwartz, a Shearson analyst, notes that if takeover activity dwindles, the industry's crucial merger and risk-arbitrage profits will suffer. And stock-trading volume seems to be weakening. But one thing should help year-to-year comparisons: The 1987 second quarter was marred by a bond-market slump that sparked big losses at several firms.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    6 Firms                          1988      1987     Chg    American Express               265,700   313,900   - 15    First Boston Corp               41,963    76,202   - 45    Merrill Lynch                   68,260   108,622   - 37    Morgan Stanley                  98,614    64,275   + 53    PaineWebber Grp                 20,761    32,597   - 36    Salomon Inc                    173,000   149,000   + 16    TOTAL                          668,298   744,596   - 10    SOAPS AND COSMETICS   Lower tax rates and cost-cutting aided first-quarter earnings. At Procter andamp; Gamble, operating profit climbed 16% to $393 million. Unit-volume shipments rose 10%, analysts say, with the international business growing faster than the domestic side. Nearly half the 40% gain in net income was due to a drop in Pandamp;G's tax rate to 33.1% from 44.5%. Gillette benefited from restructuring and management reorganization. But Avon, with its profit off 61%, blamed its two recent fragrance acquisitions, weaker home-health-care businesses and an economic slowdown in Brazil. Jay H.

Import quotas, the weak dollar and capacity cuts are fueling booming demand. Prices have regained the levels hit before the industry's long shakeout began in 1982, and, thanks to cost-cutting forced by global competition, a leaner industry is earning far more at those prices. The $56-a-ton pretax profit at USX Corp., the No. 1 steelmaker, was the highest since at least the 1960s and far exceeded the industry average of about $42. Among the one-time items: Bethlehem had a $10 million investment tax credit and $19 million in pretax charges, compared to year-earlier tax credits of $32.5 million. Inland had investment-tax rebates of $4.2 million in the latest quarter and $50 million a year earlier. Armco had a $35 million charge to close Latin American operations and a $28.3 million gain from an accounting change; a year before, it had a $41.7 million tax credit. LTV posted a pretax gain of $24.8 million on the sale of two iron-ore vessels. Wheeling-Pittsburgh had $15.2 million in tax-loss carry-forwards; the year-earlier period included $13.9 million in such gains, offset by a $149.7 million charge from an accounting change. Both LTV and Wheeling-Pittsburgh reaped big pension, interest and raw-material savings from their bankruptcy reorganizations.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    9 Firms                          1988      1987     Chg    Armco Inc                       44,000    52,500   - 16    Bethlehem Steel                 85,400    25,600   +234    Carpenter Tech                   7,329      -815    ...

MCI and ATandamp;T showed especially strong growth, analysts say, because of a surge in long-distance calls. Regulatory changes likely to be proposed this month by the Federal Communications Commission may help ATandamp;T earnings but could hurt MCI. Analysts also worry that management changes at ATandamp;T's computer business may stall a recovery at that unit. GTE and United Telecom were helped by narrower losses from their US Sprint long-distance joint venture, but continuing billing troubles and recent executive resignations are making analysts skittish about the unit's prospects. The two companies' executives rescinded earlier predictions that US Sprint would break even by next year; now, they won't make any forecast. Some Baby Bells were helped by narrowing losses and improved profits of unregulated businesses. Others, such as U S West, were aided by favorable comparisons with last year's first quarter, which included one-time charges.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    13 Firms                         1988      1987     Chg    American Info Tech             295,100   289,000   +  2    American Tel andamp; Tel             492,000   445,000   + 11    Bell Atlantic                  329,100   307,500   +  7    BellSouth                      430,900   452,400   -  5    Centel Corp                     33,318    31,759   +  5    Contel Corp                     58,917    55,043   +  7    GTE Corp                       286,270   264,732   +  8    MCI Communic                    69,000    25,000   +176    Nynex Corp                     311,100   299,200   +  4    Pacific Telesis                300,000   234,000   + 28    Southwestern Bell              218,700   237,700   -  8    U S West Inc                   240,500   204,200   + 18    United Telecomm                 34,507    13,492   +156    TOTAL                        3,099,412 2,859,026   +  8    TEXTILES   Springs Industries' 15% profit gain paced the larger companies, although most of it was due to a lower tax rate; operating earnings were flat. Springs Chairman Walter Y. Elisha says unfilled orders indicate the &quot;pattern of earnings in the first quarter should continue through the first half.&quot; West Point-Pepperell, winner of most of J.P. Stevens' assets in a takeover battle this spring, said its net was depressed by a $3.3 million charge against the sale of discontinued carpet operations; income from continuing operations increased to $18.6 million from $15.2 million. The company said order backlogs for most key products &quot;remain substantially above last year's level.&quot; Fieldcrest Cannon said operating margins in its bed and bath division continued under pressure but should gradually improve. Its carpet and rug business was hurt by off-quality production, but the company said new equipment should cut costs. Belding Heminway, which specializes in industrial thread and home furnishings fabrics, attributed its profit gain to continued improvements in margins.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    5 Firms                          1988      1987     Chg    Belding Heminway                 1,391       866   + 61    Fieldcrest Cannon               -2,279     2,414    ...

In addition, profits were hurt by tighter margins between loan yields and deposit costs and new accounting rules for loan-origination fees. The loss at Financial Corp., parent of the largest troubled thrift, was caused by a 34% increase in the loss provision to $107 million and a 55% drop in gains on sales of loans and securities to $49.2 million. At most other thrifts, deposit inflows increased sharply after the stock-market crash, &quot;but the rate decline evident in the money markets wasn't matched by declines in deposit costs,&quot; says Robert C. Hottensen Jr. of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. The analyst also notes that rate increases on adjustable-rate mortgages lag the market by a few months and that competition to make new mortgages remains intense. Nevertheless, analysts expect earnings at almost all the companies to improve for the rest of the year. &quot;The negative factors that have been depressing earnings (such as higher interest rates) have been in the system for about a year now,&quot; Mr. Hottensen says.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    14 Firms                         1988      1987     Chg    AhmansonHFandamp;Co                   30,101    89,328   - 66    CalFed Inc                      35,800    44,400   - 19    CityFed Financial                  471    14,035   - 97    Coast Sav andamp; Loan                11,262    15,095   - 25    Financial Cp Amer              -63,151     9,207    ...

But &quot;this was a good quarter for all the companies,&quot; with prices rising &quot;much faster&quot; than costs, says Emanuel Goldman, a Montgomery Securities analyst. Tobacco companies also benefited from lower tax rates and international expansion. In contrast to steady declines in the U.S., the overseas market is growing 5% to 10% annually as smokers increasingly choose American-blend cigarettes. Analysts see second-quarter earnings mirroring the first quarter.                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    3 Firms                          1988      1987     Chg    American Brands                150,400   130,800    + 15    Philip Morris                  502,000   386,000    + 30    RJR Nabisco                    273,000   220,000    + 24    TOTAL                          925,400   736,800    + 26    UTILITIES                                   1st Qtr   1st Qtr     %    36 Firms                         1988      1987     Chg    Allegheny Power                 66,876    62,105    +  8    Amer Elect Power               175,428   147,660    + 19    Baltimore G andamp; El                81,584    73,580    + 11    Carolina P andamp; L                  96,992   100,375    -  3    Centerior Energy                56,577   106,936    - 47    Central andamp; So West               66,000    67,000    -  1    CMS Energy                      78,949    35,848    +120    Columbia Gas Sys                84,559    75,925    + 11    Commonwealth Ed                141,336   201,671    - 30    Consol Edison NY               154,745   159,748    -  3    Detroit Edison                -135,823   152,558     ...
