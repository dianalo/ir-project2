The announcement yesterday by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry came amid continuing anger in the U.S. over disclosures in 1987 that a unit of Toshiba Corp. had shipped advanced-technology equipment to the Soviet Union in previous years.    MITI said a Singapore trading company ordered 500 NEC Corp. personal computers from a Tokyo trading company earlier this year. But NEC canceled the shipment when it discovered the machines were destined for North Korea, MITI said.    MITI wouldn't identify the companies involved. &quot;There was an order but the deal was cut off&quot; before any computers left Japan, said Noboru Yumoto, director of MITI's office of strategic exports. &quot;There was no wrongdoing&quot; on the part of the Japanese company, he said. &quot;We understand they canceled the order on their own.&quot;    The Japanese government is still reeling from U.S. accusations last summer that MITI dragged its feet in investigating the shipment by the Toshiba unit, Toshiba Machine Co., of sophisticated milling machines to a Soviet shipyard in 1983 and 1984. The exports violated guidelines governing technology sales to communist countries. The machines were reportedly used to make super-quiet submarine propellers.    The news of the sale set off a firestorm of criticism against Japan in Washington. The trade bill that was approved by the Senate this week but that appears to be heading for a presidential veto calls for sanctions against Toshiba because of the sale.    U.S. officials in Tokyo said they were pleased that MITI moved quickly in investigating the planned sale of the NEC personal computers. They also praised the ministry's speedy action earlier this month in charging two Tokyo companies with illegal technology shipments to China.    Like many other Japanese companies, NEC last year strengthened safeguards to ensure that it and its vendors comply with the export guidelines set by the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, the Paris-based body that regulates trade with communist countries.    ---   Unemployment Rate Falls   Special to The Wall Street Journal   TOKYO -- Japanese unemployment declined to a seasonally adjusted 2.6% of the labor force in March from 2.7% in February, the statistics bureau of the prime minister's office said.    Noting that the rate has been no higher than 2.7% since last October, a bureau official said, &quot;I think you can say the trend looks bright.&quot;    The number of job-holders rose by 110,000 in the month, to a seasonally adjusted 59.8 million, reflecting the Japanese economy's continued expansion, the bureau said. </TEXT></DOC>
