In her Nancy Reagan book, Kelley thanks Rudin for &quot;being a source.&quot;He says he was not and is asking damages in excess of $50,000.;   Rudin suedher once before when he unsuccessfully tried to halt publication of her bookabout Sinatra. This became a kind of First Amendment landmark, and Kittyemerged victorious. But Rudin did bring the successful litigation that forcedRandom House, in 1983, to recall 58,000 copies of &quot;Poor Little Rich Girl&quot; -- apotential bestseller on Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton. (Author C. DavidHeymann had incorrectly identified a Beverly Hills doctor as having prescribedexcessive drugs for Hutton.)  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE SECRET SUIT AGAINST KITTY KELLEY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Grapevine  </MEMO><TEXT>     As far as Kelley on Reagan goes, Rudin says he does not believe herassertion that Frank Sinatra and Mrs. Reagan were a romantic &quot;item.&quot; Libelspecialist Ron Smolla calls Rudin's suit against Kelley &quot;exotic.&quot; Kitty'slawyers say Rudin has &quot;no case.&quot; But Rudin feels his action will serve its ownpurpose. &quot;In effect, I've printed my own denial,&quot; he told reporter HenryWeinstein.;   MINOR SETBACK: So maybe you thought NBC's &quot;A Woman Named Jackie&quot;was filming this week in the Greek islands. Wrong. Problems in nearbyYugoslavia and the Middle East caused the producers to change their minds. Sothey have taken Joss &quot;Aristotle Onassis&quot; Ackland and Roma &quot;Jackie&quot; O'Downey tofilm their &quot;Greek&quot; scenes in the Virgin Islands. Editors are set to workaround the clock to get the six-hour miniseries finished for a showing Oct.13, 14 and 15.;   WELL-SERVED: Steffi Graf, the young Wimbledon champion,doesn't need any help on the tennis courts, but she did accept a helping handrecently when she filmed a European TV spot for pasta. The commercial showsGraf enthused about and pointing out her favorite food, but the delicatedigits fingering the rigatoni aren't hers. The ad agency felt Graf'ssports-toughened hand was not quite dainty enough to display the product. Soan Italian model with the required tapering fingers was used for theclose-ups. Still, Graf walked away with a fistful of cash -- about $1million.;   PERSONAL OPINION: The funniest column of our most recent times isSidney Zion's in the recent New York Observer, wherein he suggests how mobwiseguys could be acutely punished. Don't send them to jail! They have a heckof a good time there -- living it up pretty much on their own terms, havingprostitutes sent in as &quot;paralegals,&quot; playing cards and doing business withother wiseguys. And sending for takeout from all the best restaurants.;   Zionsays the answer is &quot;House arrest! . . . Make him go home and live with his oldlady for the rest of his life! And then you'll have what they call'deterrence.' &quot;; From Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith in Hollywood;   BUSYBERESFORD: Director Bruce Beresford will be doing double duty for the next fewmonths -- working with writers on the big-screen adaptation of &quot;LesMiserables&quot; while he directs Albert Finney, Jill Clayburgh and Piper Laurie inthe Zanuck Company's &quot;Rich in Love.&quot;;   The Aussie director, who made a namefor himself in America with &quot;Driving Miss Daisy,&quot; has just finished directingthe Richard Strauss opera &quot;Electra&quot; in his homeland. Now he's settling down inSouth Carolina, where &quot;Rich in Love&quot; goes before the cameras next month.;  &quot;'Les Miz' will definitely be his next picture,&quot; says Beresford's agent,Leonard Hirshan of William Morris.;   The film maker, who plans a Europeanshoot for the musical based on the hit stage musical adaptation of VictorHugo's novel about a convict imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread for hisfamily, inherited the project from director Alan Parker. Parker had beenattached to the Tri-Star vehicle from 1988 until late last year, when hedecided he felt &quot;a lack of passion&quot; for the project.;   &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;star Michael Crawford has been mentioned as the star of &quot;Les Miz,&quot; butBeresford will not focus on casting of the film until he has &quot;Rich in Love&quot; inthe can.;    MUM'S THE WORD: Meryl Streep and Carrie Fisher have beencollaborating on a screenplay. It's a comedy, they've just finished it -- andit's being targeted for production in early '92, with Streep starring and MikeNichols directing. It's not the first time the trio has teamed, of course.Nichols directed and Streep starred in the big-screen adaptation of Fisher's&quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot; tome  </TEXT><BYLINE>  From Liz Smith in New York  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910819  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  11B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  794  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, August 19, 199100232158,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
