The bill, which is now law, provides an income-tax exemption to banks that form international-banking centers in the two cities. The exemption will apply to profits banks earn in the centers by using nonresidents' deposits to make loans to other nonresidents. Much of the nonresident business is currently done in tax havens such as Panama and the Channel Islands. </TEXT></DOC>
