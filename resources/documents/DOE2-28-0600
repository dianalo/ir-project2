Fifty {sup 131}I-MIBG scans were performedin 35 children with histologically proven neuroblastoma (24 grade IV)and compared to bone scans, CT and NMR images, ultrasound and clinicalresults. The visualization of the primary tumor shows a higher sensitivitywith MIBG (79%) than with bone scans (47%) and a 100% specificity witheach method. MIBG and bone scans, for bone metastases, are similar inthe sensitivity (87.5%) but MIBG is much more specific (100%) than bonescan (81%). These results clearly confirm the superiority of MIBG scanfor detection of primary tumor as well as bone metastases. However, MIBGis not always the most appropriate investigation, as shown by 11 observedpitfalls. Ten false negative cases have been observed and must be considered:in five out of 10 cases, bone scans performed with /sup 99m/Tc-HMDP madethe diagnosis (3/7 cases of primary tumor and 2/3 cases of bone metastases).Moreover, one case was not usable due to a large digestive uptake. Ouraim is to understand the reasons of the false negative by a meticulousanalysis of every single case. The optimal procedure for neuroblastomadiagnosis, extent and follow up clearly seems to be the following strategy:MIBG scan must be firstly performed; in case of non-demonstrative scanthe bone scan, which is complementary, will greatly contribute to thediagnosis.</TEXT></DOC>
