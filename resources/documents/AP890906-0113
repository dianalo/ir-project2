(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge today ruled Jim Bakkercompetent to stand trial after a psychiatrist testified the TVevangelist was not mentally ill but merely had a panic attack whenhe finally grasped his downfall.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter said Bakker's trial on chargesof fleecing followers of his PTL ministry would resume later in theday.   The ruling came after a hearing for which Bakker was brought tocourt from a prison psychiatric unit in leg irons and handcuffs. Hewas committed for a psychiatric evaluation there on Thursday afterhis personal psychiatrist reported he was hallucinating and coweringunder a couch.   During the hearing, Dr. Sally Johnson, a psychiatrist at theFederal Correctional Institution at Butner, testified Bakker wascompetent to stand trial and ``has the capacity to get through it.''   She said Bakker suffered a panic attack last week after a witnesscollapsed during defense cross examination.   ``For the first time in three years, the whole situation camehome to him and he began to cry,'' she testified. ``The weight ofall these things began to coalesce and he began crying. It was apowerful emotional reaction and release.''   Potter asked Bakker to stand and answer questions before hereleased him from the custody of U.S. marshals.   ``Do you understand what you are on trial here for?'' the judgeasked.   ``Yes sir,'' Bakker responded quietly.   Asked if he was able to assist his lawyers, Bakker said, ``I'mvery tired, but I believe I can.''   His wife, Tammy, said as she left court, ``This should not beallowed in the United States of America.''   Potter did not immediately rule on a defense request for amistrial but said he expected the trial to resume at 2 p.m.   Bakker, who resigned from the PTL ministry in 1987 in a sex andmoney scandal, went on trial Aug. 28 on conspiracy and fraudcharges. Prosecutors said he used nearly $4 million in ministryfunds to live in high style.   He could could receive 120 years in prison and more than $5million in fines if convicted.   Bakker showed little emotion during the hearing, which wasattended by his wife and other family members.   Mrs. Bakker arrived with defense attorney George T. Savis shortlyafter her husband this morning and brought him a suit, shirt, tieand shoes. He was wearing gray pants and a sport shirt as he enteredthe building.   Defense attorney Harold Bender filed the mistrial requestTuesday, maintaining the jury might blame the defense for thecollapse of government witness Steve Nelson last week duringgrilling by Bakker's lawyers.   Nelson swooned after testifying he warned Bakker ``someone couldgo to jail'' over the ministry's fund-raising practices. Bakkerknelt and prayed at Nelson's side. Nelson came to within seconds andsaid he was laid low by the flu.   Johnson said she didn't detect any signs of mental disease.``It's not abnormal for someone to be experiencing those symptoms ina trial situation, especially if it comes on the heels of a majordisruption in a person's life,'' she said.   She described Bakker's symptoms as ``moderate depression'' and``situational anxiety'' and detected ``dependent features in hispersonality'' and narcissism. She said Bakker was coherent andcooperative during his evaluation.   On Tuesday, Mrs. Bakker said her husband was not mentally ill.``After 2{ years of sheer mental torture, he was just stressedout,'' a sobbing Mrs. Bakker said on a broadcast of their ``The Jimand Tammy Show.''   When U.S. marshals took him away to the prison hospital atButner, Bakker was ``so out of it'' he thought he was being taken toan animal hospital named Butler, Mrs. Bakker said.</TEXT></DOC>
