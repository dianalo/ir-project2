Judge Thomas Galligan denounced the three for showing onlydefiance. He described them as ``mindless marauders seeking athrill'' who turned the park into a torture chamber.   Although the seriousness of the charges allowed the youths to betried as adults, Galligan had to sentence them as juveniles becausethey were under age 16 when the jogger was attacked. An adult wouldhave faced up to eight and one-third to 25 years in prison.   If their appeals fail, the youths will be eligible for parole infive years.   Yusef Salaam and Antron McCray, each 16, and Raymond Santana,15, were convicted Aug. 18 of attacking the woman and assaultingtwo men during a ``wilding'' spree that night. They were acquittedof the top count of attempted murder and a lesser count of sodomy.   The jogger, an investment banker, was attacked on April 19,1989, while running in a relatively isolated section of CentralPark.   Race _ she was white, her alleged attackers were black orHispanic _ and the city's growing concern with street crime madethe case a sensation.   The woman, then 28, suffered brain damage, lost at leastthree-fourths of her blood and spent two weeks in a coma, doctorssaid. The woman, whose name has been left out of news reports,testified that she has continuing vision, balance and otherproblems, and has no memory of the attack.   She battled back from her near-fatal injuries, eventuallyreturning to her Wall Street firm, where she is now a vicepresident. She also has resumed jogging.   Each of the youths addressed the court before Galligan sentencedthem.   Salaam was the most defiant. He read a rambling, rap-style poemhe said he had composed in jail before he was bailed out.   ``I look upon this legal lynching as a test by my God Allah,''he told Galligan. ``I and many others know I told the truth. Iwould never disrespect my own religion by lying.''   ``Give me the max,'' he said. ``Sooner or later the truth willcome out.''   McCray told the judge: ``I'm not going to let this stop me. I'mgoing to make it.''   Santana, whose tone was the mildest, said simply: ``Everyoneknows I'm innocent of the crime. I never did it.''   Before he announced the sentence, Galligan said that ``theintensity of the violence that occurred that night is something norational mind can explain.''   He denied motions to have the three sentenced in Family Court,saying: ``Is sexual brutality of a woman something that'sacceptable or tolerable because it happens at the hands of a 14- or15-year-old? The answer is obvious.''   Salaam had a new attorney at the sentencing: William Kunstler,who implied that the defendants' videotaped confessions werecoerced: ``We all know what black youths in back rooms will say towhite cops.''   ``I don't expect anything to happen here other than the judge tosign the maximum,'' he told Galligan. ``I'm so sure of it I'vealready filled out appeal papers.''   During the trial, a detective testified that Santana told him hecounted 33 youths who entered the park the night of the attacks to`` `wild' some joggers ... beat up and rip off joggers andcyclists.''   McCray said on videotape that when the youths saw the joggerduring her nightly six-mile run, ``We all charged her.''   He said she struggled and screamed while several teen-agersdragged her down a wooded slope into the darkness.   On his tape, Santana admitted holding and kicking the woman andfeeling her breasts while others raped her.   McCray said he kicked her, then held for the others. When it washis turn, McCray said, he feigned the sex act to impress hisbuddies.   The defendants told detectives the naked woman was struck with ametal pipe, bashed in the head and face with a brick, cut on thelegs with a knife and sexually attacked in a frenzy of violence,prosecutors said.   Galligan has set a trial date of Oct. 11 for two otherdefendants, Kharey Wise, 18, and Kevin Richardson, 15. Anotherdefendant, Steve Lopez, 15, will be tried separately next year.</TEXT></DOC>
