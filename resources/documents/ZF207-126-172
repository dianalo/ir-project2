 Whencoupled with Kea's Zstem 240 terminal emulation software, the PowerStation240 provides an excellent VT240 environment without sacrificing full PCkeyboard functionality.andM;The PowerStation 240 is an LK201-style keyboard that can replace the standardPC keyboard while still providing all of the keys and the key layout found onDEC's VT200- and VT300-series terminals.andM;Because the PC keyboard is simpler than the VT200-series keyboard, it iseasier to locate all the necessary PC keys on a VT keyboard than it is tocram all VT keys onto an IBM PC keyboard.andM;KEA's Zstem 240 terminal emulation software provides full VT240 compatibilityas well as several VT340 features such as 16 colors, 800-by-480-pixelresolution, expanded graphics cursor styles and support for a variety ofinput devices such as mice and graphics tablets.andP;  It also includes Tektronix4010/4014 emulation.andM;Best yet, the price of the PowerStation 240 and the Zstem 240 software iscomparable to that of other terminal emulators' software packages alone.andM;COMFORT AND SPEEDandM;As LK201 keyboard clones go, the PowerStation 240 keyboard is comfortable andgenerous in its proportions.andP;  While it doesn't have quite the solid feel of atrue LK201 or 301, we found our fingers were quite at home on it.andP;  ThePowerStation 240 seems roomy compared with some of the other VT220 clonesthat we have worked with, and some of its keys are placed in more predictablelocations.andM;The keyboard's keys and key layout are almost identical to those of an LK201.andO;The sole difference lies in the placement of the four indicator lights; on astandard LK201 they are found over the Help and Do keys, while on thePowerStation 240 they are located further to the right, over the F17 throughF20 keys.andM;DUAL LABELSandM;All of the keys--with the exception of the alphabetic or &quot;typewriter&quot;keys--have dual labels; their VT220 functions appear in black while PCfunctions are in blue.andP;  The function keys of an IBM PC are mapped onto therow of VT220 function keys.andP;  The PC numeric keypad and the VT220 numerickeypad are similarly mapped to the PowerStation 240's numeric keypad.andM;The PowerStation 240 can be used with both IBM PC XT and IBM PC AT clones; aswitch on the bottom of the keyboard selects between these system types.andP;  Thekeyboard has two operating modes: VT200 mode and DOS mode.andM;Although the keyboard can be toggled between the two modes explicitly bypressing andless;Controlandgt; andless;Hold Screenandgt;, users should only find this necessary whenusing the PowerStation 240 with the more primitive IBM PC-class machine, asopposed to an XT or AT.andP;  We found that we didn't have to do any explicittoggling when using Zstem 240 on a PC XT.andM;As might be expected, the PowerStation 240's SetUp key takes the user to theZstem 240 command mode, which can be used to access any Zstem 240 function.andO;At the user's option, a Help screen can appear whenever this command mode isinvoked.andM;Although Zstem 240 has a daunting array of options, we had little troubleinstalling and using it.andP;  Installation consists of placing the software'sfirst diskette in the PC's floppy drive, typing INSTALL at the commandprompt, and selecting options from a succession of clear, basic andwell-designed configuration screens.andM;The last step was to put the software's second diskette in the PC drive tohave Zstem 240 installed in the new ZSTEM directory.andP;  We chose to installZstem on our PC's hard drive, although it can also be run from floppy disks.andM;We made our communications connection through the PC's COM1 port and had nodifficulty using our standard video adapter, a Quadram EGA card.andM;We did find that Quadram's screen saver utility conflicts with Zstem 240.andO;Once the screen saver cleared the PC's screen, we had no way of redisplayingit.andP;  We had to exit Zstem 240 &quot;blind,&quot; because Zstem 240 intercepts keyboardinput for its own use.andM;Fortunately, Zstem 240's documentation had prepared us for this difficulty.andO;It offers two ways to avoid this problem: by not installing the screen saveror by invoking Zstem 240 with the /B command qualifier, which tells Zstem 240to use the PC BIOS routines for keyboard input rather than its own routines.andM;We saw no difference in performance between Zstem 240 with or without the /Bqualifier, but some PowerStation 240 keys aren't available when Zstem is runwith this qualifier.andP;  An appendix in the Zstem 240 manual documents all ofthis clearly.andM;In addition to the usual COM1 and COM2 serial ports, Zstem 240 supports awide range of communications drivers (Table 1).andP;  It does allow the use ofDEC's LAT protocol, but only if DECnet-DOS is installed on the PC; Zstem 240doesn't understand the LAT protocol, but uses the services of DECnet-DOS.andM;PRINTER SUPPORTandM;Similarly, printers are supported not only on a PC's traditional serial andparallel ports but also, in some cases, on remote printers over a network.andO;These options include the Bridge/3Com PCS/1 network interface and a LATinterface (again, only if DECnet-DOS is available).andM;Zstem 240 supports a wide variety of printers for graphics output (Table 2),although not all of these supported printers can provide both Tektronix 4014and DEC ReGIS output.andM;A host of PC video display adapters are supported to allow the use ofenhanced features of some display adapters and the use of some adapters thatare incompatible with the usual standards.andM;Finally, in addition to the usual IBM PC AT keyboard and KEA's ownPowerStation 240, Zstem 240 provides emulation for the IBM enhanced keyboardand the Zenith PC and AT keyboards.andP;  Zstem 240 can map the cluster of sixediting keys above the arrow keys two ways so they can be defined either asthe keys on the IBM or as those on a VT200-series terminal.andM;EMULATING EXCELLENCEandM;The VT200-series emulation provided by the combination of Zstem 240 and thePowerStation 240 is excellent.andP;  There were few significant differencesbetween its performance and that of a real VT220.andM;Among the differences we noted was Zstem 240 mapping of DEC character displayattributes such as bolding and blinking to be user-selectable colors on thePC screen.andP;  Thus, what would be blinking text on a VT would be represented bysteady text in a different color.andM;However, all of DEC's VT display attributes can be represented, and in anycombination.andP;  The Zstem 240 terminal emulation software passed DR Labs' VT220display compatibility test without incurring any problems (Fig.1).andM;Some screen-manipulation routines are also handled somewhat differently byZstem 240 than on a true VT220.andP;  For example, we found that Zstem 240 mustemulate (in software) the action of scrolling a portion of the screen up ordown, which can be done in hardware on the VT220 as a quick jump scroll or asmooth scroll.andM;Thus, Zstem 240 had to give a slow movement oftext as it redisplayed thatportion of the screen for each lilne of scroll movement.andM;These differences are merely cosmetic, however, and did not influence the useof any VMS applications with Zstem 240.andM;Zstem 240 provides full support of the DEC multinational eight-bit characterset.andP;  Characters not available from the keyboard (such as foreign charactersthat include umlauts or the like) can be entered by pressing andless;Altandgt; C, whichemulates the VT220's Compose Character key.andP;  A Compose Character key isavailable, of course, on the PowerStation 240 keyboard.andM;VT240 emulation requires support for DEC's ReGIS graphics protocol, and theZstem 240 software handled it without any problems (Fig.andP;  2).andM;Because the resolution and pixel dimensions of most PC graphics displayadapters are different than the 800-by-480-pixel VT340 screen, PC terminalemulators take various tacks at displaying the ReGIS image on the screen.andO;Some stretch or compress the image, while others show only a portion of theimage at a time.andP;  Zstem 240 attempts to map the entire ReGIS image to the PCscreen, in proper scaling, and we found it was successful at doing so.andM;Zstem 240's speed at displaying ReGIS images is excellent, surpassing theVT240 with ease and rivaling the display speed of a VT340.andM;To measure these display times, we timed how long it took Zstem 240, a VT340and a VT240 to display two ReGIS images.andP;  The first image was a line graphgenerated by Access Technologies' 20/20 spreadsheet; the second was a100-block, full-screen bit-mapped picture of a mandrill (Fig.andP;  3).andM;Like DEC's VT300-series terminals, the Zstem 240 software supports theTektronix 4010/4014 graphics protocol, as well as allowing a PC mouse orgraphics tablet to be used as a graphics input device.andM;The emulator's command mode allows Zstem 240 to be configured for terminaltype, baud rate and other terminal characteristics; for fite transfercharacteristics such as transfer protocol, file type and destination; and formaintaining a directory of phone numbers for use in establishing remoteconnections (Table 3).andM;POWER TO THE USERandM;Users can define &quot;soft keys&quot;--function-key or Control-key combinations thatsend a predefined sequence of characters and keystrokes to the remotecomputer or to Zstem itself.andM;For example, to define the F6 key to start the VMS mail utility, we selectedthe softkey option from the Zstem menu, pressed the F6 key, and then enteredthe word MAIL followed by a carriage return, followed by andless;Altandgt; T to terminatethe softkey definition.andP;  Thereafter, pressing the F6 key would send thecommand MAIL to the remote computer, followed by a carriage return.andM;Because these softkey definitions can include almost every single possiblekeystroke on the keyboard, softkeys can be used to control Zstem itself, aswell.andP;  For example, a softkey definition can be made that enters Zstem 240'scommand mode and readies a file to be transmitted or received.andM;Softkey definition actually takes place in a small scripting language;besides keystrokes, a softkey definition can include other softkeydefinitions, commands to match strings that are received from the remotehost, and labels so that the softkey &quot;program&quot; can branch to one of severalactions depending on which responses are received from the remote system.andM;Softkeys are accessible by the remote host as well; the escape sequence andless;ESCandgt;[nt can be sent from the host to initiate a softkey sequence, where thenumbern corresponds to one of the softkeys andless;Altandgt; 0 through andless;Altandgt; Z.andP;  Forexample, the sequence andless;ESCandgt; [13t will invoke the softkey bound to andless;Altandgt; D.andM;In addition to terminal emulation, Zstem 240 includes file transfer featuresusing either the Kermit or Xmodem protocols.andP;  File transfer packagessupporting one or the other of these protocols are plentiful for VAXes.andP;  Weused Zstem 240 to transfer files between an IBM PC XT and a MicroVAX II withno difficulty whatsoever.andM;It is somewhat irksome that the file transfer settings for Kermit are notimmediately accessible from the file transfer option but must be reachedthrough the configuration option of the main menu.andM;Zstem 240 can support as many as four simultaneous sessions, although onlyone session can be active at any given moment.andP;  Each COM port on the PC cansupport only a single session; multiple sessions can be run on a networklink.andM;Zstem 240 on its own is a formidable piece of VT240 emulation software thatoffers excellent VT340 features at an attractive price (Table 4).andP;  For thosePC users who spend a lot of time using packages that are designed to be usedvia VT-style keyboards, the PowerStation 240 is a godsend.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
