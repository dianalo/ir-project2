Numerous studies have reported that married men get anywhere from 10% to 50% higher wages than single men of comparable age, race, education and other variables.    Messrs. Neumark and Korenman advance three possible explanations: Employers discriminate in favor of married men, either sympathizing with family needs or regarding them as more stable workers; higher-paid men are desirable marriage partners, and so are more likely to be &quot;selected&quot; into marriage; or married men are in fact more productive and thus deserve greater reward.    Analyzing the 15-year employment history of a large sample of young men, the two economists found the wages of the married men outstripping those of comparable single men by a gap that steadily widened over the first 10 to 20 years after marriage, an indication that more than simple discrimination was at work.    Then, examining supervisors' performance ratings of managers and professionals in a large manufacturing company, they found the married men consistently drawing higher performance ratings than comparable single men and far more likely to be promoted into higher paying jobs.    The two studies, they believe, appear to rule out both the discrimination and the &quot;selection&quot; into marriage theories for all but a minor part of the wage differentials. &quot;Taken together,&quot; they conclude in a recent paper, &quot;the evidence from the two data sets suggests that marriage wage premiums are due to a productivity effect of marriage.&quot; Messrs. Korenman and Neumark have already started researching just why this should be the case.    A Fresh Perspective   On Childhood Poverty   GOVERNMENT reports on childhood poverty give an incomplete picture, substantially understating the number of children living in poverty at some point in childhood but overstating the extent of persistent childhood poverty. So says a study by two University of Michigan researchers.    Greg Duncan and Willard Rodgers of the university's Survey Research Center set out to see what happens to children over a number of years as distinct from the government's annual report of the number of children living below the poverty level during the preceding year -- 20%, for example, in 1987. Drawing on a representative sample of some 5,000 families followed since 1968, the two researchers identified what had happened over the succeeding 15 years to children who were four or younger at the start.    The key finding: One-third of the children experienced poverty in at least one year, but only one in 20 experienced it for 10 years or more. However, the researchers caution in their report, &quot;persistent childhood poverty is far from insignificant&quot;; almost 12% were poor for five years or more. And racial differences were striking. Well over one-quarter of the black children were poor for 10 or more childhood years, and blacks accounted for nearly 90% of all children who were poor that long.    Simulations based on this data indicated that the mother's marital status is the factor having the broadest impact. White children who lived with one parent throughout childhood could expect 3.2 years of poverty during that period, compared with only six months for those living with two parents; for black children, the comparable figures were 7.3 years as against three years. In other words, Mr. Duncan notes, a black child living continuously with two parents was as likely to experience considerable poverty as a white child living with only one parent.    Have Baby Boomers Put   Midlife Crises on Hold?    THE MIDLIFE crisis may come later for the baby boomers than for their parents' generation -- perhaps in their early 50s rather than early- to mid-40s. Princeton University demographer Thomas Espenshade concedes this is just speculation, but thinks there's a solid foundation for it. &quot;We are not going to see a lot of bizarre baby-boomer behavior&quot; over the coming decade, he predicts.    Basically, he says, it's because the baby-boom generation has thus far moved through the life course several years behind predecessor generations. Because they stayed in school longer, they haven't been in the work force as long as previous men and women who hit the traumatic 40s. Part of the huge cohort that crowded the job market, many have climbed the career ladder more slowly, leaving ultimate work goals still unattained and thus, he believes, &quot;postponing the time when you get bored and stop and look around.&quot;    They've married later and started having children later; the empty-nest syndrome, provoking the question of &quot;what am I going to do with the rest of my life?&quot; will come later for them. And more than any previous group in their 40s, the boomers will still have living parents and even grandparents, &quot;providing a buffer,&quot; Mr. Espenshade says, &quot;between oneself and one's sense of mortality -- the idea that it's not yet my turn to die.&quot; -   Odds and Ends:   MORE YOUNG adults are living at home these days, an Education Department report says. In 1960, 43% of all 18 to 24 year olds lived at home; by 1980 the figure was up to 48.4%, and by 1985 it had risen to 53.6%. . . . Blacks who smoke are far less likely than whites to be heavy smokers, but once they start, they are far less likely to quit, according to the Centers for Disease Control. </TEXT></DOC>
