So the free-lance writer wasn't exactly thrilledwhen a literay agent suggested that he do a book about the beasts.But he wound up traveling around the world photographing andobserving bears in the wild and in the process became an ardentadvocate of protecting endangered animals.</TEXT><TEXT/><BYLINE>By KATIA BLACKBURN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Terry Domico and his Japanese companions quietlyapproach a black bear den on Japan's Honchu Island, with plans tofilm the hibernating beast through a hole in the den wall.   All of a sudden, a 400-pound ball of fur and teeth explodes fromthe snow.   The bear grabs the shirt of a graduate student as another studentand a researcher try to flee, floundering in the deep spring snow.   Domico pulls a canister of bear repellent that he has never usedbefore from his back pocket. One shot of the stuff from about 12feet away is enough to make the animal release the student.   But the bear then turns on Domico. He screams ``No!'' and firesone more shot of repellent into the bear's face, sending the hugeanimal running.   Domico recalls dropping into the snow, shaking, and turning onhis tape recorder to babble his impressions of the experience.   The attack was just one of the adventures Domico, 43, afree-lance writer and photographer who lives on San Juan Island inWashington state, had while researching his book, ``Bears of theWorld.''   Domico and his publisher pitch the book, released in November byFacts on File Inc. in New York, as an up-to-date, authoritative bookon bears.   Among the few Westerners allowed into the Wolong panda preservein China, Domico and fellow photographer Mark Newman went in 1987for an update on the $2.7 million project sponsored by WorldWildlife Fund International.   What they found, they say, was a drop in the panda population,partly because of heavy timber harvesting and farming on thepreserve. They also discovered illegal markets that sell panda andother animal parts, considered valuable for medicinal purposes.   ``I was so incensed,'' Domico says. ``According to Chineseestimates, there were 700 pandas in 1987. Now they're talking 500.They can't lose 200 pandas a year, or they're not going to haveany.''   On the Malaysian island of Borneo, Domico estimates that no morethan 500 sun bears survive.   Adult bears are poached for their meat and the cubs are raised aspets until they're confiscated by the government and released to thewild, where their fate is unknown.   Domico and Newman never found a totally wild sun bear, but formany days observed and photographed one released to the wild andactually helped the bear learn to be a bear.   Domico, who grew up in Idaho, wasn't initially enthused when aliterary agent suggested a book about bears.   ``I started this with all kinds of prejudices,'' he says. ``Ipersonally didn't like bears very much. I was scared of them. But Isoon learned that everything I knew about bears was wrong, and I washooked.   ``I'm not afraid of them now. But I respect them very much.''   Domico's book, says Gerard Helferich, editor in chief for Factson File, ``explodes a lot of myths about bears.''   For instance, Domico says, bears can see much better than iscommonly thought. They look peripherally, avoiding direct staresbecause that constitutes a challenge and almost always leads toconfrontation.   Domico photographed legendary Kermode bear, an endangeredsubspecies that is white and lives in northern British Columbia. ABritish Columbia conservation officer led him to their secret homeafter Domico promised he wouldn't divulge the location.   Many bears, including the black, brown and polar bear, are doingquite well worldwide, Domico learned. They are being better managedand their habitat has improved.   But they're also getting 90 percent of the money being spent onbears, says Dr. Charles Jonkel of the University of Montana'senvironmental studies program, the man Domico calls ``the father ofbear biology.''   By comparison, the endangered panda, sun and spectacled bears,which exist only in China, Southeast Asia and South America,respectively, can't be properly supported by their governments,which are struggling to feed their human populations, Domico says.   ``Conservation is a pastime of rich nations,'' he says. ``But onething China is sensitive to is outside criticism. Public opinionwill force China to save the pandas.''   Domico is urging letter writing campaigns by WWF, NationalGeographic and environmentalists to improve the save-the-pandaeffort and to initiate campaigns to save the sun and spectacledbears.   ``The Malaysian reserves are isolated,'' he says. ``If they'regoing to save sun bears and other large species, they're going tohave to keep those areas contiguous. China has to streamline itsbureaucracy so it's effective. Most of the money gets spent onbureaucracy before it ever gets down to where the animal is.''   China within the last year imposed sentences of life in prison ordeath for panda poachers, and Rich Block, director of publicprograms for the American chapter of WWF in Washington D.C., saysseveral people are serving life terms for the crime.   Domico also is encouraging Western zoos to better coordinatecaptive breeding programs. There are fewer than 20 pandaspermanently in Western zoos, and loan programs are declining inpopularity as scientists question whether the loan program does thepandas' cause any good, Block says. The captive breeding effort mayhave to remain concentrated in China.   Domico says he hopes the 189-page book, which includes a safetymanual, will help highlight the plight of some bear species and dofor them what whale books written 15 years ago did for that species.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Dec. 18</NOTE></DOC>
