MARTINEZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The dollar finished mixed in U.S. trading aftermarching higher overseas as investors remained bullish about theU.S. currency despite ongoing efforts by central banks to squelchdemand.   Gold finished higher in New York after falling in Europe andAsia. Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid late inthe day at $363.25 an ounce, up from $363.10 late Thursday.   Dollar traders mostly ignored efforts by central banks from theUnited States, West Germany and Japan to push the currency lower,raising more questions about the Group of Seven industrial nations'attempts to stabilize world currency markets.   ``Central banks don't seem to know what they want,'' saidLawrence A. Veit, international economist with Brown BrothersHarriman andamp; Co. ``Unless the central banks show a sign of gettingtheir act together we will see a stronger dollar.''   The dollar firmed in early trading after showing surprisingresilience on Thursday despite coordinated interest-rate increasesby central banks in Europe. Normally, such a move would blunt thedollar's attraction in global markets in favor of foreigncurrencies.   The dollar dipped briefly in U.S. trading after a LaborDepartment report suggested the economy is softer than expected,but quickly resumed its climb.   The government reported that the nation's civilian unemploymentrate rose to 5.3 percent in September from 5.2 percent in July andAugust and that the economy added 209,000 non-farm payroll jobs inSeptember, fewer than expected. Analysts said the markets hadexpected a sharper gain of up to 300,000 non-farm payroll jobs.   A softer economy could prompt the Fed to lower interest rates toavoid a serious slowdown, making the dollar less appealing toforeign investors. However, without evidence that the Fed wasmoving to ease monetary policy the dollar resumed its upward climb.   ``The short-term employment numbers were overridden bylonger-term bullishness on the dollar,'' said David Johnson,currency broker at First National Bank of Chicago.   Analysts said the Fed probably would wait for more confirmationto see if indeed the economy is slowing down before altering itscredit policy.   ``They're not going to ease rates because of a single set ofemployment numbers,'' Johnson said.   In Europe, the dollar was quoted at 1.8880 West German marks, upfrom 1.8845 marks Thursday. In late New York trading, the dollarclimbed to 1.8885 marks, from 1.8848 on Thursday.   The dollar rose 1.40 yen to 142.45 yen in Tokyo and changedhands at 142.50 yen in London, up from 142.30. In New York,meanwhile, the U.S. currency dipped to 142.35 yen from 142.55 yen aday earlier.   In London trading, the British pound rose to $1.6030, from$1.6100 late Thursday. But in New York, the pound fell to $1.6055from $1.6115 on Thursday.
