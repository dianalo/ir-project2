These include loss of desire or libido, the inability to      maintain an erection, premature ejaculation, lack of emission, and      inability to achieve an orgasm. Frequently, more than one of these      problems present themselves simultaneously. The conditions maybe secondary      to other disease states (typically chronic conditions), the result of      specific disorders of the urogenital system or endocrine system, secondary      to treatment with pharmacological agents (e.g. antihypertensive drugs,      antidepressant drugs, antipsychotic drugs, etc.) or the result of      psychiatric problems. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention deals with the inability to obtain or maintain an      erection which is due to physiologic factors. The present invention does      not deal with psychogenically caused erectile impotence. Galanthamine has      been reported as useful in the treatment of psychogenic form of sexual      asthenia in Savr. Med. (Bulgaria), 1974, 25/12 (30-34). </PAR><PAR>  Physiologic erectile impotence differs from psychogenic erectile impotence      in significant ways and one can readily separate the two types. From early      childhood through at least the eighties, erections occur during normal      sleep and is known as nocturnal penile tumescence or NPT. This happens      during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and the total NPT time per night      averages about 100 min. These erections continue to occur in patients      having the psychogenic form of erectile impotence while they do not occur      in men with physiological causes for their impotence. Therefore, the      simple observation that erectile function is present during sleep      indicates that a psychogenic cause rather than a physiologic cause is at      work. Alternative means for a differential diagnosis between the      psychogenically and physiologically mediated condition include the use of      a strain gauge with recorder or wrapping with perforated paper and noting      failure to rupture the perforations. </PAR><PAR>  According to Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 10th Ed. pp.      240-243  (1983), medical therapy for impotence has included androgens      (useful only in hypogonadal men), bromocriptine or surgical treatment (for      prolactin secreting pituitary tumor), surgery for aortic obstruction, and      implantation of prosthetic devices. As stated above, galanthamine, a      cholinergic drug believed potentially to be useful for Senile Demetia of      the Alzheimer's Type (SDAT), has been reported to alleviate the      psychogenic form of erectile impotence. </PAR><PAR>  As far as the present inventor is aware there is no suitable therapeutic      substance available for the treatment of physiologic male erectile      impotence. Recently, certain tetrahydrobenzindole serotonin agonists (such      as those in EP-A 392,768) have been alleged to be of value in improving      sexual function, particularly male potency. U.S. Pat. No. 4,530,920      mentions peptides useful in hypogonadal conditions and impotence; however,      it appears that the activity of the peptide disclosed there is related to      its androgen stimulation. As such, it would not be expected to be of any      value in conditions where hypogonadism is not at issue. </PAR><PAR>  Physostigmine has been used to obtain an ejaculation from paraplegic men      (Andrologia 20 (4):311-3, July-August 1988). Neostigmine has been used      intrathecally to obtain a sample from a paraplegic male for artificial      insemination purposes (Paraplegia 24 (1):32-7, 1986 Feburary). </PAR><PAR>  The United States Pharmacopoeia, 9.sup.th Edition lists papaverine and      phentolamine as useful in impotence. Papaverine is an opium alkaloid and      it relaxes smooth muscle in the ureter and blood vessels. Phentolamine is      an adrenergic inhibitor, while physostigmine and neostigmine are      cholinergic agents. </PAR><PAC>  OBJECT OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  It is an object of the invention to provide a method of treating      physiologic male erectile impotence with a therapeutic agent. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object of the invention to provide a method of treating      physiologic male erectile impotence without the attendant side effects of      the currently available agents indicated for this condition. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention is a method of treating non-psychogenic forms of male      erectile impotence in a male animal in need of such treatment comprising      administering to such male animal an erectile impotence treating      therapeutically effective amount of galanthamine, or a pharmaceutically      acceptable salt thereof. </PAR></BSUM><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Galanthamine use in SDAT is set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,663,318 (the '318      Patent), which is incorporated herein by reference. The present invention      is the administration of galanthamine to a patient with physiologically      mediated, rather than psychogenically mediated, male erectile impotence. </PAR><PAR>  The compound can be formulated as set forth in the '318 Patent as well as      be administered in amounts and routes as set forth there. The compound is      most advantageously administered in amounts of from 1-100 mg, preferably      2-75 mg, more preferably about 4 to about 70 mg, per dose. The dosage unit      is most advantageously tablets or capsules, but may be any other      convenient dosage form. While the preferable route of administration is      oral, any other convenient mode of administration may be used. Most      preferably, the compound is administered in amounts of 5-25 mg and even      more preferably about 10 to about 20 mg per dose. The compound is most      advantageously administered from 1 to 4 times a day, most preferably three      times a day. The above dosages are approximate for an adult human male of      approximately 70 kg and are based on galanthamine hydrobromide. Equivalent      amounts using the free base or other salts can be readily determined by      those of ordinary skill. For use with human males of significantly      different weight or with non-human animals, the drug should be      administered in the range of about 0.015 to about 1.5 mg/kg, preferably      0.03 to about 1 mg/kg, more preferably 0.075 to 0.225 mg/kg per dose which      is administered from 1 to 4 times a day. </PAR><PAR>  The invention can also be practiced with sustained release dosage delivery      forms in which case each dosage unit will have the appropriate multiples      of the effective amounts set forth above so as to be able to deliver an      effective amount of galanthamine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt      thereof for the intended delivery period. For example, a once a day      sustained delivery dosage form intended to deliver drug over the entire 24      hour period may contain the equivalent of up to 4 of the doses indicated      above. Variations on this theme will be apparent to those of ordinary      skill in this area and are considered to be within the scope of the      invention. </PAR><PAR>  Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of galanthamine include, but are not      limited to, the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, phosphate, fumarate,      citrate, methylsulfate, and methiodide. Other acid addition salts suitable      for pharmaceutical use will be apparent to those of ordinary skill. </PAR><PAR>  The following Examples are intended to further detail specific embodiments      of the invention without limiting the scope of the specification or      claims. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAR>  A human male patient suffering from a senile loss of erectile function in      conjunction with normal aging and its sequelae is given 20 mg of      galanthamine hydrobromide orally three times a day to alleviate erectile      dysfunction. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 2 </PAC><PAR>  A human male patient receiving the .beta.-adrenergic blocker propranolol      for hypertension and suffering from concomitant erectile failure secondary      to the antihypertensive therapy is given 15 mg of galanthamine      hydrobromide three times a day to restore erectile capacity. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
