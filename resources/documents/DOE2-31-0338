Preliminary analysisof this sector indicates that a significant potential exists for improvingthe energy efficiency of its stock. However, these potential savingshave not been fully realized for a number of reasons, such as lack oftechnical information on the effectiveness of various conservation measures,retrofit costs and paybacks, available financing mechanisms, and theperception that there are few incentives to conservation. In FY 1985,the US department of Energy (DOE), as part of a multifamily retrofitresearch program initiated an effort to improve the energy efficiencyof the federally-assisted housing stock with initial emphasis on publichousing. LBL, in its lead role in this sector, compiled background informationon public housing buildings, their physical characteristics, energy usepatterns, conservation potential, and barriers to energy retrofit activity.From this technical background data, the authors formulated a researchagenda and multiyear plan that begins to address the perceived barriersto attaining the conservation potential in public housing. Results andaccomplishments to date are described.</TEXT></DOC>
