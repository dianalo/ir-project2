Before the sensitive surface of the diamond there is placeda cover with a converter disk cemented to it; this disk is a U{sub 3}O{sub8} layer applied to an aluminum foil. Since the detector can be disassembled,the disk can be replaced and other materials can be used as the converter.In order to determine the optimal thickness of the converter, the sensitivityof recording thermal neutrons with a particular detector assembly wasmeasured and converters with various surface densities of {sup 235}Uwere used in the detector. Measurements were made in a standard fieldof thermal neutrons from a plutonium-beryllium neutron source insertedin a paraffin moderator.</TEXT></DOC>
