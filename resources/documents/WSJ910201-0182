But willthey lead the market in the '90s?   Neglected for seven years and ravaged last fall, smallercompanies' stocks are fast becoming the new rage on WallStreet. Now that Procter andamp; Gamble, McDonald's and other hugeengines of growth show signs of slowing, buyers are rushingto the shares of faster-growing companies traded in theover-the-counter market.</LP><TEXT>   The Nasdaq 100 index of the largest OTC issues, whoseaverage market value is $1.9 billion, has soared almost 40%since mid-October. Back then, investors were selling OTCstocks with a vengeance as they worried that smallercompanies couldn't withstand the two-fisted punch of war andrecession.   The broader Nasdaq Composite Index (average market value:$78 million) has jumped more than 25% since then. Meanwhile,the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up a less robust 15% fromits 12-month low, and the gain has been 16% for the Standardandamp; Poor's index of 500 large companies.   Debate is raging on Wall Street: is the long wait for arenaissance of small stocks finally at hand? Or is this justanother temporary rally? If it's a long-term boom,long-suffering investors in the laggard OTC stocks shouldhang in there; if not, they should sell on the small stocks'recent signs of life. There's certainly no agreement on WallStreet about how long this upturn will last.   &quot;Over the next couple of years, small- and medium-sizedstocks will outperform larger-cap stocks,&quot; predicts StevenEinhorn, portfolio strategist for Goldman Sachs andamp; Co.   &quot;We're all looking at small stocks like history willrepeat itself, but that's an illusion -- this is a differenteconomy,&quot; retorts PaineWebber strategist Mary Farrell.   In the bulls' camp, Goldman has been advising its clientsfor a year that small stocks are due for a longer-termrebound. Small stocks aren't just cheap after seven years ofneglect, Mr. Einhorn asserts, they also are increasinglyattractive to investors, because declining interest rates arecurbing the allure of money-market funds and debt securities.Meanwhile, the big companies are prospecting among the littleones for strategic acquisitions.   Technicians also cite powerful reasons for a rally insmaller stocks. From August through December, managers of&quot;aggressive growth&quot; mutual funds, which include many OTCissues, dumped more than $9.2 billion of stocks, says DickMcCabe, manager of market analysis for Merrill Lynch.   That was one of the biggest stock bailouts in two or threedecades, he adds, and may have signaled the end of investors'disenchantment with small companies. &quot;That kind of emotionalgive-up is often the sign of a bottom,&quot; he says.   Mr. McCabe, however, is waiting for one more &quot;tell-tale&quot;sign before he's willing to predict a sustainable small-stockrally. If the group holds up the next time the broader marketfalls, then the small-stock revival may be here to stay, hesays. That's what happened in 1977, when small stocksoutperformed a lagging Dow Jones Industrial Average and begana six-year run by the bulls.   Veteran small-stock investors say they were greatlyrelieved recently when a number of smaller companies'earnings came in stronger than expected. &quot;People had beenexpecting a gloomy fourth quarter, but business is improvingout there,&quot; says Robert Czepiel, manager of the $23 millionRobertson Stephens Emerging Growth Fund. Mr. Czepiel sayshe's hopeful that small stocks will outperform larger sharesfor the next two to three years.   What could derail such hopes is the increasingly globaleconomy, warns PaineWebber's Ms. Farrell. &quot;In the '90s, ofall the industrialized nations, the U.S. will probably havethe slowest growth,&quot; she says. It will be a far cry from the'70s, when small companies raced ahead as the U.S. work forcegrew rapidly and the economy moved away from manufacturing tobecome more service-driven.   &quot;It will be very tough to make money in the '90s&quot; fromsmall stocks, says Ms. Farrell. The trick, she says, will becareful selection of companies with strong prospects forgrowth. She suggests finding small companies with reliablerevenue from overseas, such as Aandamp;W Brands, which sells itsroot beer abroad. She also likes the Class A shares ofInterface Inc., a LaGrange, Ga., company that has become theworld's largest maker of carpet tiles.   Small-stock specialist Laurence Auriana, manager of the$45 million Kaufmann Fund of New York, also is wary ofapplauding too loudly over this year's small-stock fete. &quot;Ijust don't know if the trend for the group as a whole willcontinue,&quot; he says.&quot;I wouldn't bet on it.&quot;   Mr. Auriana will sell a stock quickly at the first whiffof disappointment. A thinly traded OTC stock can lose a thirdof its market value in a single day of gloomy news. Mr.Auriana, who favors diversity in the portfolio, looks forcompanies with earnings growing 25% or more annually. He iswilling to pay more than 20 times future earnings if it looksas if that growth will be sustained. Among his favorites:Employee Benefit Plans, a Minneapolis manager of smallcompanies' health-care benefits, and T2 Medical, afast-growing Roswell, Ga., provider of home infusion therapy.   Far more optimistic is Jeff Malet, manager of the $93million Pacific Horizon Aggressive Growth Fund in La Jolla,Calif. &quot;This is the start of a long bull cycle for small-capstocks,&quot; says Mr. Malet with obvious conviction. Despite lastyear's outstanding performance among biotechnology stocks, hesays he's still investing in such companies as Centocor,Biogen, Genetics Institute and Chiron. Two companiesbenefiting from the increasing demand for video conferencecalls -- PictureTel and Compression Labs -- also are amonghis favorites.   Mr. Czepiel of the Robertson Stephens fund says he'smoving away from the seemingly safe health-care stocks andincreasing his holdings in cyclical companies. He recentlypared his health-care holdings to 22% from 40% of theportfolio and boosted his technology holdings to 30% from17%. Shares of semiconductor makers and their suppliers havebecome particularly cheap, he says, adding that he likesAltera, Cirrus Logic, Dallas Semiconductor and Weitek.</TEXT></DOC>
