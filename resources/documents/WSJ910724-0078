Grace andamp; Co., alsoweighed in with earnings that, &quot;despite general weakness inthe chemical industry,&quot; rose 12% with the help of a specialgain.</LP><TEXT>   The chemical industry's earnings have been hammered inrecent quarters by overcapacity and soft markets forcommodity chemicals. But Monsanto, of St. Louis, Mo., hasbeen reducing its exposure to the boom-or-bust commoditybusiness in recent years through divestitures anddiversification.   In the latest step in that process, Monsanto disclosedlate last month that it would take an after-tax charge of$325 million, or $2.54 a share, to cover work forcereductions, plant closures and other cost-cutting measures atits chemical operations.   The charge erased what would have been record earnings forthe company, and provided instead a net loss of $52 million,or 42 cents a share. In the year-ago period, the company hadnet of $247 million, or $1.90 a share; those earlier resultswere boosted by a $31 million special gain.   Sales rose 4.5% in the latest quarter to $2.47 billionfrom $2.37 billion.   Without the charge, Monsanto's earnings would have shown asolid increase to $2.12 a share -- easily besting theapproximate $1.90 analysts had recently been expecting.Stripping out special items in both periods, the company'slatest results exceeded year-ago earnings by about 26%.   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,Monsanto shares climbed $2.375, to close at $72.50.   The company said its chemicals unit, where sales wereessentially flat, &quot;is steadily recovering from the effects ofthe recession,&quot; and that &quot;business fundamentals in U.S.markets began to improve during the quarter.&quot;   Monsanto's agricultural-products sector, with strongersales of its flagship Roundup herbicide, saw a substantialearnings increase. Its smaller Searle pharmaceuticals unitsaw operating profit more than double to $27 million, on thestrength of higher sales from its Cytotec ulcer-preventivedrug.   Separately, New York-based W.R. Grace andamp; Co. reported netincome of $57.6 million, or 66 cents a share, up from theyear-earlier period's $51.3 million, or 60 cents a share. Theupturn would have been a slimmer 5.5%, if not for a $3.5million net gain from Grace's sale of certain operations.   The specialty-chemical concern's sales increased 4.8% to$1.71 billion from $1.63 billion.   Grace cited the continued &quot;remarkable growth&quot; of itshealth care business, as well as significantly improvedresults from the company's energy operations, for the higherearnings.   In what the company called &quot;respectable earnings in somehighly competitive situations,&quot; Grace's specialty-chemicalsbusiness saw operating profit decline 2% to $68.4 million, onsales that increased 4% to $913 million.   In late Big Board trading yesterday, Grace shares shookoff the stock market's slump to rise 87.5 cents to $34.375.</TEXT></DOC>
