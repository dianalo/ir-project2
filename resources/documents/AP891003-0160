Senators voted narrowly to invoke cloture, getting 61 votes,just one more than necessary to limit debate. Thirty-six senatorsvoted against ending the filibuster by Senate Republicans.   The Republicans had been backing President Bush's refusal toappoint an emergency board, under provisions of the Railway LaborAct, to probe the strike, led by machinists, which began March 4.   The action breaks a parliamentary jam holding up considerationof a measure mandating establishment of a three-person commissionto study the work stoppage and make recommendations for itssolution.   There was no immediate indication when the Senate would proceedto a vote on the bill. Under cloture rules, no senator may talk formore than an hour after debate has been cut off. This usually meansthere would be no more than 30 to 40 hours of further debate, sinceit takes 60 senators in the 100-member chamber to invoke cloture.   Democrats had said last week that if they were successful inachieving a cutoff of debate, they would then substituteunion-backed language for the House-passed bill, creating acommission with one member each appointed by Bush, Senate MajorityLeader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,D-Wash.   ``I think, in fairness, we should invoke cloture,'' Sen. HowardMetzenbaum, D-Ohio, told colleagues before Tuesday's vote. ``Ibelieve that we owe nothing less to the workers of EasternAirlines.''   Since March, Republican members of the Senate have used delayingtactics to block the chamber's consideration of House-passedlegislation requiring Bush to appoint an emergency board. Thepresident has refused to create a board, saying management andemployees should resolve the problem.   But Metzenbaum said it was time to force Bush's hand.   ``It is now obvious that the president will not appoint anemergency board,'' he said. ``It is now obvious that unlessCongress takes action, the president is content to do nothing ...while the families of 30,000 Eastern workers suffer.''   Five days after the machinists struck Eastern, joined by pilotsand flight attendants, the carrier filed for protection under theU.S. Bankruptcy Act. Eastern has been continuing efforts toreorganize in bankruptcy court and the airline has said it plans toemerge as a carrier two-thirds its former size.</TEXT></DOC>
