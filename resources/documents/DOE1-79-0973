Thisis largely due to the fact that the majority of the chemical industriesare of the formulating rather than manufacturing type. Ingredients madeelsewhere are brought into the countries and are only mixed before sale.Thus they do not support research and development establishments. Governmentsand public fund-supported research organizations are more interested,rightly so, in solving problems of malnutrition and communicable diseaseswhich are more obvious and rampant. Thus research support to genetictoxicology is very minimal or non-existent in most countries.</TEXT></DOC>
