Five different types of interferon wereused. The response rates for human fibroblast {beta}-interferon (HU IFN-{beta})were 22.2% or 13.5% (MR-21), 10.3% or 20% for recombinant {alpha}-interferons(rIFN A and rIFN 2), and 5.6% for lymphoblast {alpha}-interferon (Interferol-{alpha}).The response rates (CR + PR) vary between 16.7% and 5.6% for the malignantgliomas, i.e. glioblastomas and malignant astrocytomas grade III. Threeglioma patients received long-term therapy with {beta}-interferon (Toray).The results are promising. A phase III study was performed to study theefficacy of radiotherapy in combination with ACNU und IFN-{beta}. Patientsin groups A received only ACNU and irradiation whereas group B receivedIFN-{beta} in addition. The response rate of group A was 18% as against42% of group B. These data suggest that {beta}-interferons considerablyenhance the growth inhibiting effect on malignant gliomas compared tomere irradiation-cum-ACNU therapy.</TEXT></DOC>
