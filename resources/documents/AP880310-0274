The Bank of Mexico report Wednesday noted the rate was wellbelow the 15.5 percent in January.   It said there was the prospect, ``based on the two-weekvariation of 2.8 percent and the favorable behavior of theprincipal fiscal and financial variables, of strong furtherreductions in the inflationary rates.''   As part of its program, called the Economic Solidarity Pact, thegovernment has said prices on officially regulated items will befrozen for the month of March and the peso, which has been steadilydevaluing against the dollar, will be held steady.   A minimum wage increase was held to 3 percent for the month,below what was expected.   The biggest price increases, both for the month of February andthe last two weeks of the month, were in furniture and domesticgoods, including appliances, soaps and paper articles, the banksaid. For the month, prices on those articles jumped 16.2 percent.   Health and personal items, clothes and shoes and educationalservices were among others with substantial increases.   Also rising were rent; some foods, including basics such ascooking oil, processed milk, corn and wheat flour, rice and beans;automobiles; insurance; books, newspapers and school materials;alcoholic beverages, and cigarettes.   The cities with the highest increases were Matamoros, across theborder from Brownsville, Texas, the northern city of Chihuahua andCordoba, in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz.   Those where inflation was held down were Navojoa, in thenorthwestern state of Sonora; Tulancingo, northeast of Mexico City;and La Paz, in Southern Baja California.   Bringing down inflation, which hit a record 159.2 percent for1987, currently is the main target of the government's economicprogram.   The pact, announced in mid-December, calls on business, industryand labor to cooperate with the government in holding down prices.</TEXT></DOC>
