People and companies concerned about potential shortagesare suddenly &quot;topping off&quot; their tanks, oil economists say.That is putting more upward pressure on prices, theeconomists add. Also, if there are going to be any oilshortages from the Middle East crisis, such buying couldtrigger them prematurely.</LP><TEXT>   Consumers aren't using more oil, just purchasing it nowand storing it instead of buying it later when they normallywould need it. Such demand is &quot;borrowed&quot; from future monthsand simply moves fuel out of primary commercial inventoriesand into so-called secondary and tertiary storage. ManyEuropean apartment dwellers are filling their fuel oil tanksin these final days of summer, for example, rather thanwaiting for winter to approach.   &quot;Nothing is really changing, except whose tank holds theoil,&quot; said Paul Mlotok, an oil economist with Morgan StanleyGroup. However, &quot;an acceleration of demands on commercialinventories could cause an apparent tightening of suppliesand a rise in price faster than would occur otherwise,&quot; hesays.   Fuel and crude oil prices, paced by gasoline, surged againyesterday. In U.S. futures trading, unleaded gasoline forOctober delivery jumped 8.34 cents a gallon to settle at94.52 cents. Heating oil rose 5.83 cents a gallon to 82.39cents. October crude oil, similar to West Texas Intermediate,increased $1.80 a barrel to settle at $29.12. Also, severalrefiners raised their field postings for the benchmark WTIcrude by $1.75 to $27.50.   The trend in demand is similar to one that developedduring the 1979 Iranian revolution. Large volumes of oil wereclosed down then, similar in size to the 4.3 million barrelsa day that Iraq and Kuwait exported before global sanctionswere imposed. In 1979, oil demand was artificially stimulatedby precautionary inventory building -- some called ithoarding -- and surged to nearly 52 million barrels a day asprices doubled.   Petroleum demand only recently has again reached the 1979level. Many estimates for current demand range from 52million to 53 million barrels a day.   Demand normally begins to rise at this time of year,hitting its annual peak during the fourth and first quarters.But there is evidence that demand is suddenly spurting wellahead of this time a year ago. In the four weeks through Aug.24, U.S. petroleum demand is estimated to have averaged 18.2million barrels a day, up nearly 6% from the year-earlierperiod.   Many oil forecasters are drawing up new demand projectionsfor the third quarter -- even though it is two-thirds over.These replace some predictions made only a month ago to takeinto account the unexpected surge.   The International Energy Agency will report this week thatits new estimate for third-quarter demand has been revisedupward by 500,000 barrels a day from its forecast of 52.6million barrels a day made a month ago. On the other hand,the Paris agency will revise its estimated demand for thefourth quarter downward by 800,000 barrels a day from themonth-earlier forecast of 55.3 million barrels a day.   &quot;There has been movement of demand forward from the fourthquarter to the third,&quot; said an IEA official.   Withdrawals from commercial inventories and higherproduction by the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries are expected to provide adequate supplies throughOctober. The IEA's new figures would suggest that chances ofany real tightening of supplies should ease later in the yearbecause of the anticipated slackening of fourth-quarterdemand.   Nonetheless, IEA officials are concerned that suppliescould become tight during the winter months. At that time,inventories will be drawn down and demand will be at itsseasonal highest. Inventories &quot;don't have infinite stayingpower,&quot; said an IEA official. One potential offset to thatscenario is an actual weakening of consumption brought on bywhat would then be months of high petroleum prices.   For next year's first and second quarters, the IEA willreport new demand estimates of 54.3 million and 51.4 millionbarrels a day, respectively. These are down 1.2 million andone million barrels a day, respectively, from the IEAforecasts made a month ago.</TEXT></DOC>
