You quoted FTC Chairwoman Janet Steigerstating that the resolution of this case &quot;sends an importantmessage to those . . . who may be tempted by the profits ofaiding and abetting a fraud.&quot; This self-righteous commentsuggests that we, who were entrapped by an officer of aprestigious insurance-brokering company into this sordid messback in 1982, could or should have known that we were aidingor abetting a fraud. We didn't. Salt is added to the wound bythe ridiculous &quot;dandelion theory&quot; advanced by the FTC's BarryCutler, who says &quot;. . . to merely shut down a telemarketingboiler room is like picking dandelions: Without going afterthe root system, the problem will spring up again.&quot; Insimilar vein, Mr. Cutler suggests that companies such as thisone were part of some evil &quot;root system&quot; awaiting the nextopportunity to profit from some scam until he appeared withhis mighty hoe.   After seven years of legal maneuvers and &quot;discovery,&quot;during which time many members of the Florida and other barswere able to extract large fees from the participants and I&quot;discovered&quot; more about the U.S. system of jurisprudence thanI ever cared to know, the situation was put to me succinctly.&quot;Here are your choices,&quot; advised a sage if cynical expert,&quot;either make a settlement which will be less than the cost ofgoing to trial or take your chances with a jury.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Cutler does your readers a disservice. He suggeststhat by the FTC's patient sleuthing, the &quot;root system&quot; hasbeen eradicated and that, presumably, the problem will notspring up again. In fact, I believe that only one or two ofthe perpetrators of this scam did a very short time in jail,a few of the boiler-room operators paid modest fines, andmany of them drove their Porsches over the state line andstarted afresh. I heard years ago that some had surfaced inCalifornia selling stakes in gold mines.   Telemarketing scams are ubiquitous and it seems that thevictims usually have little chance of any recovery.
