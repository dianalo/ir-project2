With FDIC assistance, Peoples Bank andamp; Trust, Natchitoches, La., acquired Central Bank andamp; Trust Co., Glenmora, La. Central had assets of $28.3 million and held $28 million in deposits.    The FDIC said it will purchase certain assets of the merged institution for $5.2 million. In addition, Peoples will have an option for 120 days to sell additional assets to the agency at 95% of their value for as much as $2 million.    The FDIC acted after state banking regulators told the agency that Central was in danger of failing. The FDIC generally limits its assistance to helping the purchaser of a failed bank, but it will approve a transaction involving a bank that hasn't closed if officials believe doing so would be less expensive.    The two Texas banks -- Farmers State Bank, Hart, Texas, and First National Bank of Crosby, Crosby, Texas -- are to reopen today as units of other institutions.    Farmers State, closed yesterday by state banking authorities, is to become a branch of Hale County State Bank, Plainview, Texas. Farmers State had assets of $9.6 million and held deposits of $9 million in 1,800 accounts.    First National is to become a newly chartered subsidiary of Central Bancshares of the South Inc., Birmingham, Ala., and will retain its name. The failed First National had assets of $8.2 million and held $8.1 million in 1,900 deposit accounts.    These two institutions were the ninth and 10th banks to fail in Texas this year, and they brought the number of bank failures nationwide to 32 so far this year, the FDIC said. </TEXT></DOC>
