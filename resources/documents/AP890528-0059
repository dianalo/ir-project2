Arab reports said Jewishsettlers beat up five Palestinians in reprisal.   Also Sunday, Palestinian guerrillas fired rockets at thenorthern Israeli city of Metullah from Lebanon, the first suchattack in a year. An 8-month-old boy suffered a cut on the neckfrom flying glass after one of the rockets exploded outside hishouse. No other damage was reported.   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and thePalestine Liberation Front, two radical PLO factions, claimedresponsibility.   Reacting to the claim, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Alon Lielsaid: ``While many countries around the world still believe thatthe PLO has put an end to its terrorist activites, two factions ofthe terrorist organization openly compete for the responsibility ofinjuring an Israeli baby.''   In another development, a Palestinian teenager died of a headwound he suffered in a clash with troops a week and a half ago,Arab hospital officials said. They identified him as Emad AbdelafuZughgair, 18, from Hebron.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers shot and wounded 16Palestinians in clashes with stone-throwing youths in four refugeecamps and in Gaza City, Arab reports said. The army confirmed twowounded and said it was checking the other reports.   Tensions mounted between the army and settlers over vigilanteattacks, and members of Parliament's Foreign Affairs and SecurityCommittee engaged in shouting matches with Jewish settlers whoaccuse the army of not protecting Israelis in the occupiedterritories.   Twenty-two Israelis have died since December 1987, whenPalestinians began their uprising against Israeli occupation of theWest Bank and Gaza Strip. The Palestinian death toll stands at 499.   Benny Begin, a leading member of the right-wing Likud bloc andthe son of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, told settlersduring the committee meeting, ``Blaming the army command andofficers are things that can bring us down.''   The meeting was called off as tempers rose. As the commmitteemembers left, settlers outside shouted, ``You protect the Arabs!Why not protect us?''   Earlier, a 26-year-old Israeli from the West Bank settlement ofBerakha spotted an Israeli flag painted with a Nazi swastika on aroad near the settlement. His hand was ripped off by an explosionwhen he picked up the flag, said Yitzhak Hillel, another settlerfrom Berakha.   Officials at Beilinson Hospital in Israel reported that doctorswere able to reattach the hand of the victim, identified as SimchaVolker.   Arab reports said six cars full of Jewish settlers beat up fiveArabs in and around the nearby village of Burin just after the 6:30a.m. explosion.   Three people were dragged from vehicles and attacked, and twomen were beaten in their homes, the reports said. The victims weretreated at Ittihad Hospital in Nablus, four miles away, hospitalofficials said.   Recently, there have been several attacks on Arabs by Jewishsettlers seeking revenge for stoning and firebomb assaults onIsraeli cars.   Some settlers have hit soldiers who tried to prevent the revengeattacks. Arabs have charged some soldiers also assisted the settlerrevenge sprees, but the army denies the accusations.   During a Cabinet meeting Sunday, the military chief of staff,Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, said vigilante attacks are interfering withsoldiers' ability to put down the uprising.   Communications Minister Gad Yaacobi of the Labor Party calledfor the arrest of settlers who attack Arabs.   ``They cannot take the law into their own hands,'' he said onIsrael radio after the Cabinet session. ``It is an action againstthe law.''   An army spokesman said the West Bank military commander, Gen.Amram Mitzna, appointed a special ombudsman to handle mountingcomplaints from Palestinians about misconduct by soldiers andsettlers.</TEXT></DOC>
