Gold prices rose worldwide.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for currentdelivery closed at $363.40 a troy ounce, up $1.40 from Wednesday.Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at$363 an ounce, $1.50 higher than Wednesday's late bid.   Many traders stayed on the sidelines while awaiting thegovernment's release Friday of retail sales and producer pricesdata for September.   ``If the Producer Price Index comes in on the high side, the(Federal Reserve) won't have room to ease (interest rates) anyfurther,'' said Bob Morrissey, a senior trader at the Bank ofBoston's New York office.   ``While the Fed is concerned about the level of the dollar,their major priority is to keep inflation'' down, he added.   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was undermined byspeculation that the Fed was considering a cut in the discountrate, its interest charge on loans to member banks. Lower interestrates make U.S. investments less attractive to foreigners, therebydiminishing their need for dollars.   Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers HanoverTrust Co., said that despite the fact that the dollar is holding tokey levels, the U.S. currency is likely to come under pressurebecause interest rate differentials have narrowed considerably.   U.S. interest rates currently are about 2.5 percent higher thanthose in Japan, he said.   ``And historically, as it gets under 3 percent, the dollar comesunder pressure,'' Flanagan said, adding that earlier this year thespread was as high as 5 percent, ``which had kept the underlyingsupport of the dollar all year.''   Separately, the British pound got a boost from comments byChancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, who told the governingConservative Party's annual conference he would continue to fightinflation with high interest rates for as long as necessary.
