The victory offorces led by Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin, backed by Americanimperialism, will lead to fascism, they said.;   Patrick McGuire, 40, anOakland artist, held a framed, woven portrait of Vladimir Lenin above hishead, chanting, &quot;Lenin, yes! Yeltsin, no!&quot; Across the street, the red flagwith the hammer and sickle flew from the roof of the six-story brick consulatebuilding.;   &quot;They changed the revolution, so they ought to take down theflag,&quot; said McGuire, who wore a black beret and showed off the Soviet-madebullet hanging from a string of beads around his neck. &quot;It doesn't meananything now.&quot;;   The pro-Soviet Workers World Party, which is headquarteredin New York, is an old-style Communist Party, down to its democraticcentralist organizational structure and careful adherence to doctrinal purity.The party's goal remains an international Communist revolution.;   Founded in1959, the party supported the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and since 1987has opposed Gorbachev's perestroika on the grounds it undermined socialism.Last week, the party supported the hard-line elements of the Soviet systemthat sought to roll back the reforms.;   'Progressive intention'; &quot;We weresympathetic to them,&quot; Becker said. &quot;Those who created the emergency committeewere trying to prevent the full-scale counterrevolution from triumphing. Wethought that was a progressive intention.&quot;;   Crossing the street, a33-year-old unemployed computer programmer, who identified himself only asSaul K., presented a letter from the party to an accountant leaving theconsulate after a day of work.;   In the interest of &quot;proletarianinternationalism,&quot; the letter demanded full freedoms for Communists in theSoviet Union. The accountant, Michael Suvorov, said the demonstrators'opinions found an echo, however faint, inside the consulate.;   &quot;Our peoplehave different opinions,&quot; Suvorov said. &quot;Some people have to give up somethingthey believed in their whole lives. For them, it is very difficult.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID BANK, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Francisco  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910828  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  454  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, August 28, 199100241126,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
