Conflict between police and activists has escalated over the pastfew days as a mass defiance campaign against apartheid laws andemergency restrictions spread to most major cities.   Anti-apartheid groups today mounted the greatest number ofprotests since they began the campaign earlier this month. Protestorganizers announced plans to extend the civil disobedience towhites-only schools.   Police arrested the activists outside city hall in the port cityof Durban while they were tying yellow ribbons around palm trees andhanding out pamphlets calling for an end to mandatory militaryservice for white males.   The activists belong to the End Conscription Campaign, whichvowed Monday to operate openly though it is banned by the white-ledgovernment.   Police arrested five people Monday at a demonstration by theorganization, which seeks a system of alternative national servicefor white men who don't want to serve in the military.   In Cape Town, students at several mixed-race and Indian schoolsset up barricades of burning tires on streets near their schools.Students in the mixed-race township of Athlone township also stoneda fire engine, forcing firefighters to flee.   At an Indian high school, students used the flagpole to raise thegreen, gold and black banner of the outlawed African NationalCongress guerrilla movement. Students at several schools hungbanners calling for a boycott of the Sept. 6 parliamentary electionsthat exclude the black majority.   Police used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators at fourschools, witnesses said.   A number of leading anti-apartheid groups have unilaterallydeclared themselves ``unbanned'' as part of the defiance campaign,which began Aug. 2. The organizers say they are mounting non-violentprotests to end segregation of hospitals, neighborhoods, schools,beaches and other facilities.   Police have responded by banning or breaking up some rallies andarresting or detaining without charge dozens of activists.   Hundreds of activists released from detention have been placedunder restriction orders that limit their movements and politicalactivities.   A spokesman for Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok said todaythat people who violate those orders ``will sooner or later have toappear in court to answer criminal charges.''   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.   The Mass Democratic Movement, a loosely based coalitionorganizing the protests, said black teachers and students wouldbegan presenting themselves at whites-only schools in coming days.The coalition set no exact date or location for the protests.   Police said a small mine exploded before dawn today at a postoffice outside Cape Town. It caused no injuries, and there were noimmediate claims of responsibility.</TEXT></DOC>
