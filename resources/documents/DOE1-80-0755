<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-80-0755 </DOCNO><TEXT>The disciplines of biology and medicine are developing very rapidly. Withthe development of genetic engineering, the potential threat from morecomplex, unique, very toxic and hitherto unknown pathogens has becomea reality. In addition to the development of new and unknown weapons,genetic engineering offers the possibilities for new vaccines and diagnosticmethods. In order to judge the threats poised by international developmentsin this area, a continuous and active analysis of the possibilities ofgenetic engineering is being carried out. A portion of that work is presentedin this report. The topics include: working methods in genetic engineering;cultivation of genetically altered cells; genetic engineering of plants;genetic engineering of pathogenic microorganisms; factors that can causeinjury to humans; factors related to microorganism survival; diagnostics;vaccines.</TEXT></DOC>
