Productionpeaked in 1972, and convention held it would continue to decline exponentially.Discovery and production from the universe of smaller fields or increasedrecovery from older, larger fields would not nor could not significantlychange the pattern. However, the response of the oil and gas resourcebase to the extensive exploration and extended development during thepast decade in the US lower 48 was significantly greater than anticipated.With increased drilling, annual reserve additions that had been generallydeclining for nearly 30 years began to trend upward at about the samerate as that of drilling increase. From 1979 through 1985, average annualreserve additions essentially matched production levels. Oil productiondecline was arrested, and stable levels of production were maintainedthrough 1985, before the drastic fall in prices and drilling effort in1986. Two aspects of the recent experience indicate that they shouldreconsider the capability of the US resource base to sustain production.First, the rate of oil and gas finding, expressed in volumes discoveredper foot of exploratory drilling, decreases with cumulative drilling,but remains stable through extended, and increasingly greater, drillingintervals. This is in substantial contrast to the conventional assumptionthat rate of finding declines exponentially with continued drilling.Second, the amount of additional reserve growth available from existingolder, and generally larger, fields through extended conventional developmentand recovery techniques was much greater than expected from historicallycalculated growth factors.</TEXT></DOC>
