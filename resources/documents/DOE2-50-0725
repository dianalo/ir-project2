This announcement ledto storms of protest from NATO allies, members of Congress, and the SovietUnion. Congressional debate over the last two years, led by Senator SamNunn, demonstrated conclusively that when the Senate, by a vote of 88-2,gave its advice and consent to ratification in 1972, it did so on thebasis of the traditional interpretation. The Reagan administration restedtheir case for the new interpretation primarily on their review of thetreaty's negotiating record. One of the authors of this article (Rhinelander)was a legal adviser to the SALT I delegation. He and Rubin recently examineddeclassified portions of the negotiating record. Their findings are explicatedhere, with the conclusion reinforcing what all negotiators except PaulNitze have said, namely: the traditional interpretation is irrefutablythe one negotiated and agreed upon by both parties in 1972. They findthe administration position extremely puzzling since the reinterpretationis not even necessary to continue a robust SDI program, which Nunn andother congressional leaders support.</TEXT></DOC>
