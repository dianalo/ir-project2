Samples of environmental media werecollected to determine radionuclide and chemical concentrations at locationsin the geographical area. Results are discussed in detail in subsequentsections of this report. Surveillance of radioactivity in the Hanfordvicinity during 1987 indicated concentrations well below applicable DOEand US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards. Radioactive materialsreleased from Hanford operations were generally indistinguishable abovebackground in the offsite environment. Continued influence from the 1986reactor accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station in the USSR wasnot apparent this year. Chemical concentrations in air were below applicablestandards established by the EPA and the State of Washington. Chemicalsdetected in the ground water beneath the Site can be attributed to bothSite operations and natural background levels. Several chemicals regulatedby the EPA and the State of Washington exceeded EPA drinking water standards(DWS). 106 refs., 71 figs., 110 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
