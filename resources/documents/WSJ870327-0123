The bank, in its annual evaluation of the economy, said Malaysia's inflation-adjusted output of goods and services rose 1% in 1986 from the year before. That marked a rebound from 1985, when the economy contracted 1%.    Assuming firmer commodities prices and small gains in other economic sectors, the bank predicted that gross domestic product will expand between 1.5% and 2% in 1987. Economic growth is expected to level off at an annual rate of about 2% by 1988.    The modestly upbeat report may give solace to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, whose management of the economy has drawn criticism from some businessmen, as well as opposition political leaders and rivals within his own political party.    Even so, the economy is likely to remain hobbled by its vulnerability to shifts in prices of vital commodities, a sluggish flow of new local and foreign investment, a heavy foreign-debt burden and persistent problems in the country's financial sector.    The central bank noted that since October, &quot;a growing demand for Malaysia's exports, coupled with a revival in the prices of the major primary commodities&quot; -- including crude oil -- &quot;helped to place the economy on a clear but gradual path to recovery.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
