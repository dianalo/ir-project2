Increase of energy supply must be filledby an oil substitute energy. As an organization to fill the nucleus partof this development, NEDO was established in 1980 for the technologydevelopment for the following new energies. Photovoltaic generation:Continuous production technology of solar cell. Utilization of photovoltaicgeneration systems (8 systems) and system construction and operation(2 systems). Solar air conditioning: Continuous experimental operation(4 systems) was finished. Industrial solar system (3 systems) are constructedand are under study. As for geothermal energy: Thermal generation at9 spots, 215,000 KW capacity are in operation. Geothermal water powergeneration, 10,000 KW class binary plant is under development. Coal energy:High calorie gasification, 7,000 Nm{sup 3}/d class plant is in operation.Wind power generation, 100 KW plant is under operation. (9 figs, 5 tabs,8 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
