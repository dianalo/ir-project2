In court papers filed this week, lawyers for the former DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc. high-yield bond division leader claim that ``aconstant stream'' of press leaks is threatening Milken's right to afair trial.   The motion asks U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood to order thegovernment to stop leaking confidential material, hold a hearing toidentify the sources of the leaks, punish the leakers and makepublic a confidential Securities and Exchange Commission memowritten about in The Washington Post.   No members of the media would be called at any hearing on themotion because ``we are not interested in confrontations with thepress,'' the motion adds.   The lawyers claim the government has turned confidential grandjury proceedings into ``a spectator sport'' by releasing informationabout the Milken probe repeatedly over the last three years topressure witnesses and other possible targets to cooperate.   The motion, filed Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan, claimsthe alleged leaking ``flatly violates'' federal criminal regulationsand other legal and ethical rules requiring confidentiality ingovernment investigations.   ``We are asking the court to stop the government from continuingits leaking and to punish those government officials responsible,''Martin Flumenbaum, a lawyer for Milken, said Thursday.   A hearing to ferret out media leaks would not be unprecedented.The motion cites the 1980 bank fraud case of former Carteradministration budget director Bert Lance, in which a federalappeals court ordered such a hearing.   Though the Milken motion seeks to exclude reporters, ``Motionslike this have the potential for leading to First Amendmentconfrontations with the press,'' according to one prominent FirstAmendment attorney, who asked not to be identified.   Milken, his brother, Lowell, and former Drexel trader BruceNewberg were charged March 29 in a 98-count fraud and racketeeringindictment that alleges insider trading, securities law violationsand other crimes in the broadest action of the government's WallStreet crackdown. They pleaded innocent and a March 1990 trial isset.   Milken was first named in news reports as the government's maintarget shortly after now-jailed stock speculator Ivan Boesky agreedto cooperate with prosecutors in late 1986.   Newspaper stories since then regularly have contained advancedetails of the government's investigation and indictment plans,including the charges.   The Milken motion cites stories published in The Wall StreetJournal, The New York Times, The Washington Post and the Los AngelesTimes about the case quoting ``sources close to the investigation''or ``people familiar with the government's investigation.''   Roger May, spokesman for Dow Jones andamp; Co. Inc., which owns TheWall Street Journal, said the newspaper does not comment on itssourcing policies.   ``Our job is to try to find out what people are doing. That'swhat we do, added Martin Baron, business editor of The Los AngelesTimes.   The 31-page motion states that, ``The government has presented _and is continuing to present _ its case to the grand jurors as muchthrough the pages of the daily papers as through the testimony ofwitnesses in the grand jury room.''   The document cites three recent stories in the Post based on aconfidential May 1988 SEC report containing details of secrettestimony of government witnesses, and other articles specifying thecontents of a new Milken indictment expected in October.   The leaks are the result of ``decisions by some in the governmentto use publicity as a prosecutorial weapon, carefully timing thedisclosures to `pressure' defendants, witnesses and those underinvestigation,'' the motion states.   An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment on the memo. The U.S.attorney's said it would respond to the motion in court.</TEXT></DOC>
