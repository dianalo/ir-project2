The decision came in a 10-minute telephone call by Shamir toBush on Wednesday night. Avi Pazner, a top aide to Shamir,described the talk as ``warm and friendly.''   It was the first time the two leaders had talked since thehostage crisis flared following Israel's kidnapping of Moslemcleric Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid from southern Lebanon on July 28,Israeli reports said.   A spokeswoman in Pazner's office said said Bush made no mentionof Obeid's abduction, which the United States has criticized, butthat the two leaders decided it was best to join forces on thehostage-prisoner issue.   Shamir assured Bush that Israel would include the eight Americanhostages in any deal to trade Obeid and other Shiite prisoners inIsrael's hands for three Israeli soldiers held by the pro-IranianHezbollah movement in Lebanon, Pazner said.   The conversation came the same day a Shiite suicide attacker setoff a car bomb near the Israeli border in southern Lebanon,wounding five Israeli soldiers and one Lebanese militiaman.   Hezbollah, the shadowy pro-Iranian group, claimed responsiblityfor the assault.   One of the wounded Israelis was in critical condition today, ona respirator at Rambam Hospital in the northern port of Haifa. Theothers were reported recovering.   Israel's policy coordinator for southern Lebanon, Uri Lubrani,warned Israel would retaliate for the attack.   ``Israel will deal with the Hezbollah as it deals with all theorganizations which threaten the normal life of the securityzone,'' Lubrani said. He was referring to a strip north of Israel'sborder patrolled by Israeli soldiers and its allies, the SouthLebanon Army militia.   ``Violence has two edges and Israel will retaliate in one way oranother,'' Lubrani said. ``In due time, in a place it will choose.''   Ron Ben-Ishai, a well-known commentator on defense issues, saidthe government was caught in a dilemma over whether to stage areprisal at a time when there may be hope for hostage negotiations.   ``The negotiations are at initial states and Israel will beblamed by the United States for torpedoing them, or runs such arisk,'' Ben-Ishai said on Israel radio.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin's spokesman denied a report inthe Kuwaiti Al-Seyassah daily, which said Israel had abducted Obeidto sabotage a PLO plan to win freedom for the American hostagesthat was endorsed by the United States.   Israel boycotts the Palestine Liberation Organization, which itconsiders a terrorist group, and has repeatedly protested U.S.contacts with the PLO.   Rabin's spokesman, Eitan Haber, reached by telephone, said theKuwaiti report was ``nonsense.''</TEXT></DOC>
