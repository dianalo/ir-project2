Bush met at the White House with Democratic and Republicanleaders of Congress to seek their ideas on how to resolve the crisisof failing savings and loans. A bailout may cost the public upwardsof $100 billion.   ``We've got a big problem in the savings and loan'' industry,Bush told the lawmakers, meeting in the Cabinet Room. ``There are noeasy answers, no worrying about blame _ plenty to go around. I wantto see the problem solved.''   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell, D-Maine, pledged their cooperation in seeking asolution.   After the meeting, Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, senior Republican onthe Senate Banking Committee, said an idea floated by theadministration last week for a fee on savings deposits ``is not alive option'' even though the White House has not disavowed itpublicly.   However, Garn said he believes savings institutions will have topay a higher premium to obtain federal insurance for deposits.   Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., chairman of the Banking Committee,said Bush did not give a clue about what he would propose. ``Iwouldn't say he gave an indication where his thinking is going. Hedid take a lot of notes'' on the points raised by participants.   ``We're going to look to find a way to put together a fundingpackage that is as fair as it can be,'' Riegle said. ``We're goingto look to the taxpayers absolutely as a last resort.''   Setting out a timetable for producing an administration plan,Bush said he will meet Saturday with Treasury Department officialsto hear their final recommendations and then early next week revealthe course he will take.   Nevertheless, Bush told the congressional leaders, ``you're notbeing presented here with a stacked deck. We need ideas and if we'reoverlooking something, we want to know what it is.''   The president said, ``Whatever we come up with will not bepopular. And I expect then whatever you come up with will not bepopular. But we've got to get on and get the problem solved.''   ``We want to work with you. This is a serious problem,'' Mitchelltold Bush.   The administration is worried that advertisements from banks inthree states questioning the safety of savings and loan accounts mayneedlessly scare depositors who are already worried.   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, who was present attoday's meeting, criticized the ads Thursday at a private, hour-longmeeting of Bush and five Sandamp;L and bank trade associations, saidFrederick Webber, president of the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions, who attended the meeting.   Sununu, waving copies of several of the ads, said, ``Gentlemen,it is absolutely, unequivocally irresponsible to have placed thoseads,'' according to another participant, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   At today's meeting, Bush did not mention the ads but said, ``Thesafety of those deposits is guaranteed, will continue to beguaranteed and there should be no feeling around the country thatsome solution will do anything to diminish the credit of the UnitedStates being behind the deposits, the FSLIC, FDIC, whatever it is.''   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation insuresdeposits at Sandamp;Ls and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporationinsures those at commercial banks.   Mary-Liz Meany, a spokeswoman for the American BankersAssociation, said Sununu gave the association copies ofadvertisements placed by banks in Texas, Arkansas and Kansas.   ``We are going to call the banks and inform them of the concernin Washington and the sensitivity that they might not be aware of,''she said. ``We made a promise to the administration that we wouldcertainly monitor it and we agreed with their concern.''   Bush did not speak at the meeting about the ads or reveal anypreference among the many options for addressing the Sandamp;L crisis,according to participants.   ``He was there to learn from us and he's a good listener,''Webber said. ``It was very gratifying. The man is personallyinvolved in this.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said proposals in thepresident's address to Congress Thursday ``will be pretty specific.You'll know exactly what our proposal is.''   The spokesman outlined the ``basic points'' guiding the president:   _insured savings must be protected.   _current problems must be solved and losses stopped.   _permanent reforms preventing a recurrence must be enacted.   _the deposit insurance system should be put on a sound financialfooting.   _cleanup costs must be equitably allocated.   Sununu's anger over the advertisements underscores theadministration's concern that the debate in Washington over how topay for the Sandamp;L crisis has unnerved some thrift depositors.   Last week, regional Federal Home Loan Banks reportedhigher-than-expected Sandamp;L withdrawals after Treasury SecretaryNicholas Brady and other administration officials discussed asuggestion that depositors pay a fee to raise money for the Sandamp;Lbailout.   Meeting participants said Bush stressed, as he did a week ago ina nationally televised news conference, that the deposits are backedby the full faith and credit of the federal government. He plannedto make the same point in his speech next week.   But Mark Riedy, president of the National Council of SavingsInstitutions, added: ``The feeling in the meeting was this is aserious situation. By the time it gets to be a real run, it's toolate.''   On Capitol Hill, Charles O. Bowsher, head of the GeneralAccounting Office, urged the government to take prompt control ofthe 350 remaining insolvent, but still open, Sandamp;Ls after agreement isreached later this year on a bailout and reform package.   The congressional auditing and investigative agency said Congressshould provide a plan to raise $85 billion over three years, coupledwith a reform package. At that point _ which some senators say maybe as late as the fall _ regulators should take control ofinstitutions, placing them into receivership as necessary.   In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Bowshercriticized regulators' current approach of using promissory notesand loss guarantees to conserve cash and spread rescue costs over 10years.   In another development, the House Banking Committee released along-awaited report from the GAO that turned up six instances inwhich independent accounting firms ``did not adequately audit''institutions that later failed.   The GAO said ``auditing and reporting problems (were) significantenough (in six cases) to warrant our referring the CPA firmsperforming the audits to regulatory and professional bodies fortheir review.''</TEXT></DOC>
