Devisinghe's small rice paddy is180 miles from the battlefields where the Sri Lankan government isfighting Tamil rebels, but he a war victim nevertheless.   He has lost his son and his mud and thatched home has beenburned down.   In Sri Lanka's south, where the 60-year-old rice farmer lives, aradical movement has sprung up among the country's majoritySinhalese to counter government efforts to finally make peace withthe minority Tamils in the north.   Sri Lanka, the island formerly known as Ceylon off southernIndia, now faces two bloody insurgencies in place of the one thatbegan in ethnic conflict five years ago.   As in the Tamil struggle for independence in the north, thevictims in the south are often poor villagers like Devisinghe.   Sinhalese guerrillas came to his door in this tiny village 15miles inland from the coastal town of Tangalle in June and accusedhis son of being a government spy.   They set fire to the hut. Later, the headless body of his son,30-year-old Gunasena, was found in a field nearby.   ``The JVP did it,'' Devisinghe said in a whisper. ``The JVP.''   The JVP is the Janata Vimukti Peramuna, or Peoples LiberationFront, which has been accused of slaying more than 350 people inthe past year.   The Marxist front, all but destroyed by government forces afteran abortive coup attempt in 1971, is regrouping in the south byappealing to Sinhalese nationalism.   Under the slogan ``Save our Motherland,'' the JVP has recruitedstudents and the rural poor to launch a bloody campaign againstPresident Junius R. Jayewardene and his United National Party.   Its victims have included the party's president and generalsecretary as well as simple villagers. Jayewardene himself narrowlyescaped assassination in a grenade attack in Parliament last August.   The government has sent several thousand troops south to try toend the insurgency.   ``Neither we nor, in the end, the people will tolerate theirviolence,'' said Lalith Athulathmudali, Sri Lanka's nationalsecurity minister.   Ironically, it is Jayewardene's strategy for making peace withthe Tamils in the north that got him in trouble in the south.   On July 29, 1987, Jayewardene signed an accord with PrimeMinister Rajiv Gandhi of India to end the Tamil insurgency.   India, whose own Tamil minority of 60 million is sympathetic tothe Sri Lankan revolt, had been accused of supplying guns to therebels. Its role under the peace pact is to guarantee the fightersgive up their arms.   In exchange, Sri Lanka is to give the Tamils limited autonomy intheir traditional northern territories while preserving thenational unity that the majority Sinhalese demand.   But the largest Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers ofTamil Eelam, has rejected the settlement, and India has sent morethan 50,000 soldiers to the island to help put down the Tigers'rebellion.   Sporadic clashes with the Tigers persist, but an Indian diplomatsaid a final settlement appeared close.   ``The Tigers are now virtually destroyed as a military force,''said the diplomat, who insisted on anonymity. ``It is just aquestion of time before they agree to return to the politicalmainstream.''   Both Tamils and Sinhalese are skeptical, however, that theIndian-enforced peace plan will end the bloodshed.   The Tigers have never given up their call for an independenthomeland to protect the Tamil language and culture.   A chasm of distrust between the two ethnic communities also hasbeen created by the long, bloody conflict.   The Tamil uprising began July 23, 1983, with a rebel raid thatkilled 13 Sinhalese soldiers and a week of revenge rioting bySinhalese that left at least 1,000 Tamils dead.   The attacks and counterattacks that followed wiped out entirevillages of Tamil peasants and Sinhalese settlers in the north andeast. More than 8,000 people have died.   S. Selvarajah, a Tamil whose stationery store in Colombo, thecapital, was burned down in the 1983 riots, says he fears theIndian plan cannot protect his people.   ``How can we trust anymore?'' he asked. ``We do not feel safe.We worry it could happen again.''   In the southern coastal town of Matara, Sinhalese lawyer MahindaWijesekera has doubts, too.   ``Regardless of what they say, the Indians are trying to divideour island, and people will rise up against that,'' he said.   The tension between the two communities arises from differencesin race, religion and language that have simmered for centuries onthis lush island of coconut palms, tea and spices.   The Sinhalese are descended from Indian Aryans who colonized SriLanka more than 2,500 years ago. They are Buddhists who make upabout 75 percent of the 16 million population and dominate thegovernment.   Darker-skinned Dravidians invaded later, also from India, andovercame the Sinhalese to found a kingdom in the island's north.Their Tamil descendants, mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of theisland's people.   Through 400 years of Portuguese, Dutch and British rule, the twopeoples each spoke their native tongues.   But in 1956, eight years after independence from Britain, thegovernment declared Sinhala the island's official language.Protests by the Tamil-speaking minority were put down with force.   Mohammed Ashraf, a Moslem lawyer from the northeast, dates muchof the current troubles to the language law.   ``The polarization started then and hasn't stopped,'' he said.   It has spread to the 1-million-member Moslem community, too. TheMoslems, descended from early Arab traders, are lobbying for theirown ethnic district.   When the Indian-brokered settlement goes into effect, the Tamilswill elect a local council in the north and be given authority overeducation, law enforcement and development.   Neelan Tiruchelvam, a moderate Tamil politician, says the accordestablishes ``a basic framework for Sri Lankan society to remainunited.''   The pact, he says, recognizes that the island is a pluralisticsociety, not a Sinhalese-Buddhist domain.   But the JVP contends the accord really gives the Tamils whatthey wanted _ a homeland.   Its posters and pamphlets call on Sinhalese to unite against theplan and threaten to kill those who support it.   The group's undeground leader is Rohana Wijeweera, 45, agraduate of Moscow's Patrice Lumumba University. Throughclandestine indoctrination classes and cassette tapes, heemphasizes reclaiming the country for the Sinhalese majority.   Western diplomats said Wijeweera has about 500 armed followers,some believed to be army deserters, and perhaps as many as 10,000sympathizers.   The JVP has been accused of robbing banks and hijacking payrollsto fund its operations.   During the rice harvest in April, JVP supporters wentdoor-to-door in the south collecting rice ``taxes'' based on thesize of each family's field.   ``Some gave willingly,'' said Wilbert Weerasekera, a Wetiyafarmer. ``Some were unwilling, but they also gave.''   Many southern schools have been closed by JVP-backed boycotts,and school walls are covered with anti-government slogans.   Black paint scrawled on the stucco walls of the deserted schoolin Tangalle hints of a long struggle.   ``First we must save our motherland,'' it says. ``Then we willgo to school.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 24</NOTE></DOC>
