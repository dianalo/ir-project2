The payment, according to one source, would be &quot;easily&quot; $10 million and probably in excess of $20 million. Other banks have paid from $40 million to more than $100 million to settle shareholder allegations of mismanagement related to large losses.    BankAmerica's insurers are believed to be picking up much of the tab, the sources indicated. An insurance executive confirmed that an accord had been reached.    BankAmerica declined to comment. It may, however, have reserves to cover any portion of the settlement for which it is directly liable, cushioning the impact on earnings. Much of any settlement would also go to pay the plaintiffs' legal bills.    Shareholders sued the San Francisco-based banking giant in July 1985 immediately after it reported a $338 million second-quarter loss, reflecting an $892 million provision for future loan losses. The loss, which stunned analysts and shareholders, turned out to be the first of several quarterly debacles that the bank sustained because of massive loan problems.    Among other things, the suits alleged that BankAmerica officers and directors violated disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws, as well as laws covering fraud, by allegedly failing to fully disclose the extent of its lending practices and problems.    The suits were both derivative actions, where recoveries are paid to the corporation itself, and class action lawsuits, where shareholders who bought BankAmerica stock are directly recompensed. The sources indicated that at least the derivative suits were being settled, and that the class-action suits were close to completion, if not already resolved.    Sources said settlement documents would be filed soon, possibly as early as today, in federal court in Los Angeles, where the suits are pending. The settlement would be subject to court approval.    The expected settlement indicates a thawing in relations between BankAmerica and its former director and officer liability insurers. Its main insurer, Employers Insurance of Wausau, canceled the bank's policy in April 1985, after BankAmerica sued it in state court in Los Angeles to recover losses allegedly caused by the involvement of BankAmerica employees in a mortgage-backed securities scandal that year.    While the planned settlement isn't expected to address the mortgage litigation, a source close to the case said an accord, by disposing of other claims, may lead to a resolution of the mortgage suits.    In that case, BankAmerica acted as an escrow agent and trustee for the securities, which turned out to be backed by either phony or greatly inflated mortgages on properties in Texas and California. BankAmerica took a $95 million pre-tax charge as a result, and sued the principals involved.    Since the cancellation, BankAmerica bankrolled a Cayman Islands unit to insure company officials, but shareholder attorneys have argued that Employers Insurance remained liable because claims were filed before the policy was terminated. A year ago, BankAmerica obtained additional insurance, but didn't name the carrier.    BankAmerica declined to comment on the prospect that it was close to settling the mortgage-securities suit. In Wausau, Wis., an Employers Insurance spokesman declined to comment. In Boston, officials at First State Insurance Co., another BankAmerica insurer during 1985, couldn't be reached. Richard Greenfield, a Haverford, Pa., lawyer who filed one of the shareholder suits, declined to comment.    Shareholder suits have become common and controversial for banks. Last year, Seafirst Corp., BankAmerica's Seattle-based unit, obtained a $110 million settlement from five former top executives. Two years ago, Crocker National Bank, now part of San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank, settled a holder suit for what shareholder attorneys estimated was between $40 million and $60 million.    BankAmerica's expected settlement comes at a time of improved operating performance for the long-troubled concern. In the third quarter, BankAmerica earned $54 million, or 25 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $23 million a year earlier. More important, the company had an operating profit for the first time in six quarters. </TEXT></DOC>
