Abundio Juarez Mendez, deputy director of primary production forPemex, said the company last month exported 250,000 42-gallonbarrels of the new crude, called Olmeca. He did not identify thepurchaser.   He said the new crude can be priced a dollar more a barrel thanthe Isthmus brand, which previously was the nation's superior oil.Mexico also exports a heavy crude, called Maya.   ``(Olmeca) is much finer than Isthmus (and) it is superior toArab light,'' Juarez Mendez told local reporters at an oilconference on Latin American drilling, according to the article,which was published Thursday.   Mexico, he said, has the capacity to eventually export 125,000barrels to 150,000 barrels a day of the new crude, which is beingextracted from fields in the southeastern state of Tabasco alongthe coast of the Gulf of Mexico.   Juarez Mendez said the new oil has a density of between 38 and40 on the American Petroleum Institute scale, compared to a densityof 32 to 34 for Isthmus.   The English-language daily Mexico City News quoted anunidentified Pemex official as saying the government ``is not yetsure how much light oil it has. Pemex is still exploring.''   ``There is probably not much Olmeca in Mexico,'' he was quotedas saying.   Pemex, meanwhile, reported that prices to Japanese clients forIsthmus and Maya crudes were held steady in May   The price for Isthmus was $15.30 a barrel in May to Japan, thesame as in April, and for Maya, $12.60 a barrel.   ``This reflects the stability that prevails in the general levelof prices in the international oil market,'' Pemex said in astatement.   Mexico has a contract with Japanese customers to supply 180,000barrels of oil a day, the statement said.   Mexico's prices vary according to geographical area. The oilcompany did not give the May prices for U.S. and European customers.   In April, the price of the Isthmus brand to U.S. customers was$16 a barrel and $12.77 for the heavy type.   Mexico maintains an export platform of 1.36 million barrels aday.</TEXT></DOC>
