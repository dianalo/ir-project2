Each Investment Company is organized as a Massachusetts business trust,is registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end management investment companyand is a ``series company'' as defined in Rule 18f-2 under the 1940 Act.TMAMLP serves as investment adviser to each Investment Company. Advisoryfees paid to TMAMLP range from 0.325% per annum of average daily net assetsto 0.75% per annum of average daily net assets of the various series ofthe Investment Companies. TMAMLP, a Delaware limited partnership, is registeredas an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (``AdvisersAct''). All of the limited partnerhship interests of TMAMLP are publiclyheld and are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ``TMA.''Thomson McKinnon Asset Management Inc. (``TMAM''), a wholly-owned subsidiaryof TMI, holds all of the general partnership interest in TMAMLP. Acquiroris a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance Company of America(``Parent''). Van Eck Associates Corporation (``Van Eck''), an investmentadviser registered under the Advisers Act, serves as sub-adviser to oneseries of TMIT, and Warburg Investment Management (``Warburg'') servesas sub-adviser to another series of TMIT. Under the sub-advisory agreements,TMAMLP pays to Van Eck and Warburg sub-advisory fees equal to 0.375% perannum and 0.40% per annum, respectively, of the average daily net assetsof the applicable series of TMIT.  2. TMI has been seeking an infusion of long-term capital since mid-1988.Serious negotiations between TMI and Acquiror began in May 1989, but itwas not until June 5, 1989 that TMI focused exclusively upon a sale ofTMI to Acquiror. Negotiations intensified during the week of June 5 andon the evening of June 8, the President of TMAMLP, who had first learnedof a possible sale of TMI in late April and who was the only officer ofTMAMLP to know of the negotiations with Acquiror until June 8, met withthe Chairman of the Independent Trustees of the Investment Companies toexplain that an acquisition of TMI by Acquiror was a realistic possibility.On Friday, June 9, all of the Trustees and counsel to the independent Trusteeswere notified of a meeting of the Boards of Trustees of the InvestmentCompanies to be held on the evening of Tuesday, June 13. Contingenciesto the execution of a definitive agreement were not favorably resolveduntil the afternoon of June 13, and the transaction was not approved byAcquiror's Board of Directors until late afternoon. TMI announced the transactionat approximately 5:00 p.m.  3. A definitive Stock Purchase Agreement (``Stock Purchase Agreement'')was executed as of June 13, 1989 providing, among other things, for theacquisition by Acquiror of the entire equity interest of TMI. Upon completionof the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement (``Acquisition''),Acquiror (or another direct or indirect wholly owned-subsidiary of Parent)is expected to own all or substantially all of the outstanding voting securitiesof TMI. Conditions to consummation of the Acquisition include, among others:(i) Receipt of an order of the Commission granting the requested relief;(ii) repurchase by TMI of all of the TMI securities owned by an institutionalinvestor; (iii) receipt of clearance from the New Jersey Departments ofBanking and Insurance; (iv) expiration of waiting periods applicable underthe Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1978; and (iv) completionby the parties of due diligence. It is anticipated that the Acquisitionwill be consummated on or about July 17, 1989, in the requested order ofthe Commission is received and if all other conditions to consummationhave been fulfilled. Because the Acquisition may be deemed to result inan indirect change in control of TMAM, the sole general partner of TMAMLP,and/or a change in control of TMAMLP itself, the acquisition may be deemedto result in an assignment within the meaning of section 2(a)(4) of the1940 Act of the existing investment advisory agreements of each of theInvestment Companies with TMAMLP, terminating each investment advisoryagreement and sub-advisory agreement pursuant to its terms.       4. The Board of Trustees of each Investment Company was notified withinhours of the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement. The Applicantsstate that notification prior to that time would have been premature, sincethe terms of the transactions had not been finalized and it was uncertainthat the parties would in fact reach agreement. At the meetings held onJune 13, 1989, the Boards of Trustees of each of the Investment Companies,including a majority of the Trustees who are not ``interested persons''of the relevant Investment Company, as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the1940 Act, met in person and concluded unanimously, with the advice of independentcounsel, that it was in the best interests of each Investment Company andits shareholders to file the application as a necessary step in implementingnew advisory and sub-advisory agreements during the Interim Period, soas to minimize the disruption in advisory services to each Investment Company.The Boards of Trustees have scheduled another in-person meeting on July6, 1989 to consider further the advisability of entering into new agreementsproviding for advisory and sub-advisory services following the Acquisition.As part of that process, the Boards of Trustees, with the advice of independentcounsel, will comply with the requirements of section 15(c) of the 1940Act. 5. As soon as reasonably practicable, but within the Interim Period inany event, the Investment Companies will present for Board of Trusteesand shareholder approval new agreements providing for advisory and sub-advisoryservices following the Acquisition. It is not possible for the InvestmentCompanies to obtain such shareholder approval in accordance with section15(a) of the 1940 Act prior to the anticipated consummation of the Acquisitionon July 17, 1989. As noted above, the Investment Companies had no advancenotice of the proposed transactions. Shares of the Investment Companiesare beneficially held by more than 500,000 shareholders. Since a ``majorityof the outstanding voting securities,'' as defined in the 1940 Act, ofeach series of each Investment Company will be required to approve thenew advisory arrangements, the Applicants believe that substantial timeand effort will be necessary to obtain the required votes. Shareholders'meetings require the preparation of proxy materials and subsequent clearanceby the staff of the Commission, as well as a solicitation period that issufficient to obtain the requisite quorum. Although the Investment Companiesare preparing these materials as quickly as possible, it will be impossibleto hold special meetings of shareholders before the Acquisition, as therewill not be an adequate solicitation period to assure a quorum of shareholdersat the meetings. <ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Legal Conclusions </ITAG>The Applicants state that the requested order is necessary and appropriatein the public interest and consistent with the protection of investorsand the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940Act for the reasons set forth below, as discussed more fully in the application.6. The management of TMI and those shareholders who are parties to theStock Purchase Agreement considered and rejected two other ways of dealingwith the effect of the proposed Acquisition upon the advisory agreementsbetween TMAMLP and each of the Investment Companies. First, consummationof the Acquisition might have been conditioned upon the approval of theshareholders of all the Investment Companies. This approach was rejectedbecause it would have meant a delay of up to 2\1/2\ months in consummatingthe Acquisition, and such a delay would have adversely affected the interestsof all parties. The Applicants note the likelihood, among other things,that protracted uncertainty as to the future of TMI could cause substantialdefections by the registered representatives of TMI's broker-dealer subsidiary,Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. Such defections would adversely affectTMAMLP and the holders of its publicly-traded limited partnership units.Second, TMAMLP might have given the appropriate 60 days notice to the InvestmentCompanies, so that the investment advisory agreements would terminate uponthe change of control in TMAMLP. This approach was rejected because itwould have delayed the consummation of the Acquisition for at least sixtydays. In addition to the adverse consequences of delay noted above, theInvestment Companies would have been required either to reengage TMAMLPor to find a suitable replacement, and to obtain shareholder approval,all within the 60-day period, in order to avoid a potential disruptionin investment services. 7. It was decided that the interests of the shareholders of each of theInvestment Companies, the stockholders of TMI and the unit holders of TMAMLPwould be best served if the consummation of the Acquisition were made contingentupon the receipt of the relief requested in the application. The Applicantsstate that there will be no diminution in the scope and quality of servicesprovided to the Investment Companies during the Interim Period. The newadvisory and sub-advisory agreements to be implemented during this periodwill have the same terms and conditions as the existing agreements. EachInvestment Company will receive the same investment advisory services asbefore, provided in the same manner, at the same fee levels, and, it isexpected, by the same personnel. Advisory fees paid by an Investment Companyduring the Interim Period under a new advisory agreement will be maintainedin an interest-bearing escrow account, and amounts in the account willbe paid (a) to the Investment Adviser only upon approval by the shareholdersof the Investment Company, or (b) absent such approval, to the InvestmentCompany. The Applicants assert that this arrangement is in keeping withthe provisions of Rule 15a-4 (other than the provisions limiting the abilityof persons affiliated with the advisor to profit from the assignment transaction)and the purposes of Section 15 of the 1940 Act, since the Trustees of theInvestment Companies will have approved the new advisory agreements priorto their implementation and since no fees will be paid unless the agreementsare approved by the Investment Company shareholders.8. The Applicants submit that circumstances which have given rise to therequest for relief are similar to those of other types of assignments thatare not reasonably foreseeable. The extremely rapid culmination of theParent-TMI negotiations did not present, and the form of transaction deemedmost appropriate by Parent and TMI did not permit, an opportunity to secureprior approval of new advisory and sub-advisory agreements by shareholdersof the Investment Companies. The Applicants further submit that to depriveTMAMLP of its customary fees for the Interim Period because the Acquisitionmay technically result in an assignment of the Investment Companies' existinginvestment advisory agreements would be a harsh result and an unreasonablepenalty to attach to the transaction. The Applicants believe that the requested120-day Interim Period will facilitate an orderly consideration of theadvisory and sub-advisory agreements by the Investment Companies' Boardsof Trustees and shareholders. They assert that such an Interim Period isconsistent with the provisions of Rule 15a-4 and the purposes of Section15 of the 1940 Act, as well as the corporate governance objectives of the1940 Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Conditions</ITAG>If the requested order is granted, the Applicants agree to the followingconditions:1. The new advisory agreements to be implemented during the Interim Periodwill have the same terms and conditions as the existing advisory agreements,and the new sub-advisory agreements to be implemented during the InterimPeriod will have the same terms and conditions as the existing sub-advisoryagreements.2. In considering new advisory and sub-advisory agreements to be implementedduring the Interim Period, the Boards of Trustees of the Investment Companies,including a majority of members who are not ``interested persons,'' willtake any additional steps which may be necessary to comply with the requirementsof section 15(c) of the 1940 Act. Upon completion of their review, theapplication will be amended promptly to reflect the Trustees' formal conclusionsand the bases therefor.3. Fees earned by the Investment Adviser and paid by an Investment Companyduring the Interim Period in accordance with the terms of a new advisoryagreement will be maintained in an interest-bearing escrow account, andamounts in the account will be paid (a) to the Investment Adviser onlyupon approval by the shareholders of that Investment Company, or (b) inthe absence of such approval, to the respective Investment Company.4. Acquiror (or an affiliate of Acquiror) will pay the costs of preparingand filing the application and the costs of holding all special meetingsof the Investment Companies' shareholders necessitated by the Acquisition,including the cost of proxy solicitations. Additionally, Acquiror (or anaffiliate of Acquiror) will pay the incremental costs necessitated by theAcquisition in connection with meetings of the Investment Companies' shareholders.5. TMAMLP will take all appropriate steps so that the scope and qualityof advisory and other services provided to the Investment Companies duringthe Interim Period will be at least equivalent, in the judgment of therespective Boards of Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees whoare not ``interested persons,'' to the scope and quality of services previouslyprovided. In the event of any material change in personnel providing servicespursuant to the advisory or sub-advisory agreements, TMAMLP will appriseand consult with the Boards of Trustees of the affected Investment Companiesin order to assure that they, including a majority of the Trustees whoare not ``interested persons,'' are satisfied that the services providedwill not be diminished in scope or quality.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, underdelegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
