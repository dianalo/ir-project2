The pact was signed Monday morning by visiting U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and by Japanese Agriculture Minister Takashi Sato, according to a late Reuter report.    The U.S. was scheduled to hold a news conference to explain the details of the pact after Mr. Yeutter met one more time with Mr. Sato. Mr. Yeutter also was to meet with Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi, who is acting as prime minister and foreign minister while Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno are in Canada for the Toronto economic summit.    Earlier yesterday, Mr. Yeutter and Japanese officials worked out the main points of the agreement, which was expected to allow U.S. beef producers to nearly double their exports to Japan over the next three years from the 1987 quota of 214,000 metric tons, and to abolish the quotas in 1991.    The accord is designed to close one of the last remaining contentious trade issues between the U.S. and Japan. The Reagan administration now is likely to try to resolve the issue of U.S. access to the Japanese semiconductor market, which last year resulted in U.S. trade sanctions against Japan. But those sanctions aren't likely to be lifted as a result of the latest accord, as some Japanese officials had hoped.    The agreement could prove to be an advantage for Mr. Takeshita at the Toronto summit of leaders of the seven major industrialized countries. Agricultural liberalization is supposed to be one of the topics under discussion and the agreement, which Mr. Takeshita has promised since January, would be a sign that Japan is willing to participate in the process of rationalizing the industrialized nations' heavily protected agricultural sectors. It also would bring the Reagan administration a step closer to resolving all its major trade disputes with Japan.    In Washington, U.S. officials had expressed great satisfaction with the proposal, because it commits Japan to eliminate quantitative restrictions in a politically sensitive trade area. President Reagan is likely to hail the accord at the summit; it also will be cited as evidence by Republicans that their party has been tough and successful on trade.    But in Japan, the agreement, which grants major concessions to the U.S., is expected to be very unpopular with the powerful farm lobby, known as Nokyo or Zenchu. Many Japanese legislators are reliant on Nokyo's support for re-election.    Japan is expected to expand significantly import quotas on beef and citrus over the next three years, and then eliminate them. Under an agreement that expired in March, the 1987 beef-import quota was 214,000 tons. According to U.S. officials, Japan agreed to allow beef imports to rise to 274,000 tons in the first year, 334,000 tons in the second year and 394,000 tons in the final year.    In the second three-year period, the officials said, Japan would raise its tariffs on beef to 70% from the current 25%. The tariffs would be reduced to 50% over three years. In this period, however, a &quot;safeguard&quot; system would permit Japan to impose an extra 25% tariff if U.S. imports reached a specified level above the previous year's amount. That provision would permit a maximum tariff of 95% in the pact's fourth year.    After the second three-year period ends, U.S. officials said, the Japanese tariffs on beef would be determined by whatever is provided in the current Uruguay Round of negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    Offsetting the sharp increase of the tariff from the current 25%, Japan is said to have agreed to allow U.S. beef producers to export directly into Japan, bypassing the Livestock Import Promotion Council. The semi-governmental body limits imports, controls all distribution of beef and sets prices, sometimes raising them as high as three times the import price.    U.S. beef industry officials have said they would be willing to accept higher tariffs on beef if the council were eliminated in the import process. U.S. officials said they accepted the tariffs because private U.S. government studies show that U.S. beef is so much cheaper to produce that it could be priced lower in Japan than domestic beef, even with high tariffs and shipping costs.    On citrus products, the U.S. believes Japan will phase out quotas over three years, permitting an increase of 22,000 metric tons annually, and to allow imports of Florida citrus products during that period. Currently, U.S. officials said, only California exports are permitted. In addition, Japan would to drop rules requiring that U.S. orange juice be blended with domestic varieties and that only concentrated juice be permitted into Japan.    Some Japanese news reports had suggested that an agreement was possible because powerful Japanese legislators, known as the agriculture tribe, decided it would be a good idea. These politicians have controlled the negotiations with the U.S., and had preferred a GATT solution to a negotiated one, because that would have helped them to escape blame from the Nokyo for giving in.    The agriculture tribe reportedly wanted a beef settlement because two other issues important to Japan's powerful farm organization are coming up. The government intends to cut the price it pays farmers for rice. Tax reform also will reduce many of the tax benefits farmers have enjoyed since the 1950s. </TEXT></DOC>
