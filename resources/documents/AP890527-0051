Also today, in the first official acknowledgement of a powerstruggle at the top, China's former President Li Xiannian accused``certain people in the leadership of the Communist Party'' ofcreating confusion in China.   The statement, broadcast on state-run radio and television, cametwo days after Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang was reportedlystripped of power and placed under house arrest for apparentlybeing too sympathetic to the protesters' demands for democraticreforms.   Student leaders Wang Dan, Wu'er Kaixi and Chai Ling, at a newsconference on the square, called for a citywide march and massrally on Tuesday after which students would leave the square.   The three, the top leaders of the uprising, said they wanted toleave the square because of ``sanitation and to return the squareto the people.''   They demanded an end to martial law ordered for parts of Beijingon May 20 by Premier Li Peng and the withdrawal of the tens ofthousands of army troops surrounding the capital.   The student leaders said the approximately 10,000 studentsremaining in the square would make the final decision on whether toleave. They said student representatives would begin tonightmeeting with groups of students to reach a final decision onwhether to end the Beijing protest.   They also called for April 27 to be made into a holiday forfreedom and democracy. On that date, hundreds of thousands ofstudents and workers took to the streets in Beijing to protest aPeople's Daily editorial accusing the student movement of causingturmoil.   Yang Jianjun, a junior at Liaoning Fuxing Institute of Miningand Technology in northeastern China, said the activism displayedin Chinese cities should be brought to rural areas.   Yang, who was at the Beijing train station to return home today,also said: ``The conditions are really bad at the square. A lot ofpeople are tired of living out there.''   Students began leading organized demonstrations on April 15 todemand talks with officials on democratic reforms and endingcorruption and profiteering by party officials.   The rallies gradually escalated, drawing many verage citizens,and culminated with the occupation of the square by hundreds ofthousands and a hunger strike by 3,000 students in Tiananmen Squareon May 13, two days before Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev'shistoric visit to China.   At times a million people swarmed through the square and city.Li declared martial law on May 20, but soldiers either werereluctant or unable to move against the jubiliant masses.   The protests caused a power struggle between more moderateleaders and hardliners, with Li apparently emerged victorious.   The student leaders did not mention another march, planned forSunday, in Beijing. Student activists in Beijing had called for aworldwide march of ethnic Chinese and a citywide strike in Beijing.   Most people do not work in China on Sunday.   In a shrill speech, former President Li Xiannian also was quotedas urging a crackdown on a small band of criminals who, he said,were trying to overthrow the rule of the Communist Party.   ``These people have an organization, a plan and a plot,'' hesaid. ``If they succeed China will be thrown into a deep disaster.''   In another blow to the moderate faction led by Zhao, Wan Li,chairman of the standing committee of the National People'sCongress, threw his support to Premier Li and other conservativeswho ordered martial law.   Wan, a moderate, cut short his visit to the United Statesearlier this week and was initially reported to be placed underhouse arrest on his arrival in Shanghai Tuesday. His statementtoday, also read on state-run radio and television, indicated thatwhatever help he could have provided Zhao had been neutralized byconservatives.   ``After I had time to study the situation,'' Wan was quoted assaying, ``I realized that a small minority was behind a plot tocause turmoil in society.''   Wan said he would call a meeting of the National People'sCongress around June 20 to discuss some of the student's demands,including their opposition to corruption. But, he said, changesmust come ``slowly because society is very complex.''   Li Xiannian, in his speech to the Chinese Political ConsultativeConference, said part of the current ``disturbances'' were causedby the fact that campaigns to fight ``bourgeois liberalization''were not carried out fully. Hundreds of moderate intellectuals werecriticized in the 1987 campaign. Books and movies were banned andpress censorship was tightened.   Another reason, he said, was the activities of ``certain peoplein the leadership of the Communist Party.'' The reference appearedto be to Zhao.   Signs that the military, blocked so far by popular resistance,might move soon to end the students' two-week occupation of thesquare were growing.   Plainclothes officers, wearing military pants, were seenstrolling in pairs around the square this morning.   Long lines of students formed at the Beijing railway stationwaiting for trains to the provinces. Student broadcasts, quotingrailway officials, said 26,000 left Beijing on Thursday and thatthe number of departures was growing.   The government has given students priority in getting tickets toexpedite their departure from the city.   Smaller numbers of students continued to arrive in the capitaldespite a State Council order issued Thursday that students beprevented from boarding trains for Beijing.</TEXT></DOC>
