(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A computerized X-ray scanner developed tofind defects in auto parts is giving medical researchers betterglimpses of bone structure than conventional analysis methods can,and in less time.   ``This new technology is allowing us to better understand theconsequences of bone changes caused by disease or age,'' such asosteoporosis, said Steven Goldstein, director of the University ofMichigan's orthopedic research lab.   The microcomputer tomography scanner, or MicroCT, was developedin 1981 by Ford Motor Co. to find structural flaws in ceramic carparts. It yields three-dimensional images, which Goldstein is usingto study trabecular bone _ a porous, spongy, shock-absorbingstructure found near joints.   Osteoporosis and other bone diseases affect trabecular bonefirst, and more extremely, than other bone. Osteoporosis, a commonailment among the elderly, occurs when bones become porous, brittleand slower to heal.   By studying how trabecular bone changes during the course of thedisease, Goldstein hopes to learn how to control the weakening.   The MicroCT, in 15 minutes, takes 129 two-dimensional X-rays of asmall bone sample from several angles. The data is fed to a computerthat creates a three-dimensional image in less than three hours.   The computerized bone reconstruction is faster than microscopicanalysis, yields more details and lets researchers examine innerbone structure without having to slice up the specimen, he said.   However, the MicroCT cannot be used on living patients, and isonly used on bone specimens because it would burn soft tissue.</TEXT><HEAD>Compact Disc Holds Huge Quantity of Computer Data</HEAD><DATELINE>TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new computerized compact disc with thecapacity of 1,350 floppy diskettes may mean affordable access todata once reserved only for those with mainframe computers andsizeable budgets, researchers say.   FEDSTAT, the Compact Disc-Read Only Memory (CD-ROM) and thetechnology that makes it work are a venture of the University ofAlabama, JVC Disc America Co. and U.S. Statistics Inc., aVirginia-based online data service.   FEDSTAT contains some of the most widely used Census Bureaudemographic and economic data. On the single disc are statisticsabout each city and county in the United States _ information aboutpopulation, business and the economy.   While some of the information has been available in printed form,some had been accessible only through magnetic tape processed by amainframe computer.   ``Never before has this much government data been available in aninexpensive, easily used format,'' said Philip Turner, dean of thegraduate school of library service and director of the project forthe university.   The county business patterns files alone take up about 2{ feet ofshelf space on paper, said U.S. Statistics President Warren Glimpse.The capacity can't be measured only in terms of its volume as foundin other sources; ``this is a new approach to data,'' he said. ``Thecapacity to cross-tabulate, to create new data, is infinite withFEDSTAT.''   The disc contains 484 million characters. Retailing at $195, itis used on a CD-ROM player attached to a personal computer. Theplayer costs about $500.   Data range from population figures as specific as the number ofchildren under 5 for any county in the nation to annual economicdata by county for the past 20 years. Users also can prepare countymaps selecting from thousands of subjects; compare counties,metropolitan areas, states, the nation and other countries; anddevelop forecasts based on historical data.   The first orders for FEDSTAT have come from such organizations asthe New York Public Library and the Library of Congress. Turnerpredicted that within two years, CD-ROM technology will be availableat most university libraries, larger public libraries and 15 to 20percent of school libraries.   A new version of the first FEDSTAT disc will be produced eachyear, Glimpse said, with partial updates issued on additional discsthroughout the year.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for July 17</NOTE></DOC>
