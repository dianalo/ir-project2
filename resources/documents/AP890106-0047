Ending years of research and controversy, the FAA on Thursdayissued the requirement that all commercial jetliners with 30 or moreseats have the device, Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System,known as T-CAS II, by Dec. 30, 1991.   In addition, turbine-powered commuter aircraft with 10 to 30passenger seats must carry a less sophisticated collision system,known as T-CAS I, within six years. The system alerts pilots topotential collisions but does not provide them with avoidancemaneuvers as does T-CAS II.   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley, in making the T-CAS IIannouncement Thursday, said the new rule will be ``one of the mostsignificant safety initiatives in recent years. It will provide anadded margin of safety for the flying public. This equipment willprovide pilots with an independent backup to the safety serviceswhich they already receive from the air traffic control system.''   For some time, the FAA has let it be known it was preparing sucha requirement. Several airlines have been using operational T-CASunits on a test basis on a small number of planes for more than ayear.   The FAA and industry have been testing various versions of acollision avoidance system since the mid-1970s and the governmentannounced in l981 that it would pursue development of the so-calledT-CAS system for use by commercial jetliners.   The agency estimates the rule will affect 3,364 existing U.S.commercial airplanes and an additional 3,100 airplanes that areexpected to be added to the airline fleets by the year 2003. Thecost to the airlines of equipping these aircraft is put at $806.3million, according to the FAA.   The T-CAS system, installed in the cockpit, alerts a pilot ifthere is another aircraft in the vicinity and on a potentialcollision course.   A computer analyzes the flight path of both aircraft and if thepotential for a collision increases, a computerized voice advisesthe pilot whether to ``climb'' or ``descend'' to avoid the otherplane.   The system works only if the second aircraft has a similar systemor a so-called ``Mode-C'' transponder which provides altitudeinformation. Although many private airplanes do not have a Mode-Ctransponder, the FAA requires such equipment in most airspace usedby commercial jetliners.   Airline pilots have supported development of a collisionavoidance system, but the pilots union has not favored the T-CASsystem being required by the FAA.   The 40,000-member Air Line Pilots Association has pushed fordevelopment of a more sophisticated system that would give not onlydescend and climb directions, but also direction to turn left orright to avoid a collision.   The FAA, however, decided not to require the more sophisticatedsystem which has not been fully tested as yet in order to speed upinstallation of the devices.</TEXT></DOC>
