Yang@  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL><DD> 07/28/89 </DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO><GV> CONGRESS (CNG) </GV><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The House Judiciary Committee approved legislation designed to circumvent a Supreme Court ruling that prohibits states from punishing a person who burns the U.S. flag as a political protest.    The 28-6 vote by which the proposed criminal statute was passed belies the partisan division created by the issue in the House. It came after a sometimes raucous committee meeting in which Chairman Jack Brooks (D., Texas) blocked Republican efforts to substitute a constitutional amendment and committee Democrats defeated other GOP attempts to derail the measure.    The full House is to consider the bill in mid-September, shortly after lawmakers return from a monthlong recess. In the Senate, Democratic and GOP leaders have agreed to consider both a statute and a constitutional amendment in October.    The Judiciary Committee's measure would make it a crime for anyone to &quot;knowingly mutilate, deface, burn or trample upon&quot; a flag, punishable by as long as one year in prison and an unspecified fine. An exception would be made for disposing of a worn or soiled flag.    Currently, federal law makes it a crime to &quot;knowingly cast contempt&quot; upon a flag by &quot;publicly mutilating, defacing, defiling, burning or trampling upon it&quot; and provides penalties of as long as a year in prison and a fine of as much as $1,000.    Last month, the Supreme Court threw out the conviction of a Texas man who set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration. The court said he was &quot;engaging in political expression&quot; that is protected by the First Amendment. By dropping the phrase &quot;cast contempt,&quot; proponents of the legislation believe it would avoid the court's objection by targeting an action rather the intent behind it.    The committee-passed bill includes a provision calling for expedited judicial review of the statute, and Rep. Brooks vowed to introduce a constitutional amendment himself should it fall.    House Republicans, along with President Bush, say only a constitutional amendment would protect the flag. White House Chief of Staff John Sununu this week urged House GOP leaders to continue pressing the flag issue because he believes it could divide House Democrats, according to House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R., Ill.).    The Democratic leadership is more wary of tampering with the Bill of Rights and wants first to try a statutory remedy. But Democrats also are angry and nervous over the way Mr. Bush used the flag to associate himself with patriotic values in last year's presidential campaign and are fearful of being driven in the same corner that Michael Dukakis found himself regarding the Pledge of Allegiance issue.    House Democrats, including Speaker Thomas Foley of Washington and Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri, jammed a small stage to face television cameras and praise the bill. They also used the opportunity to fire a salvo in the battle of symbols.    While Mr. Bush used the Iwo Jima Memorial as a backdrop when he called for a constitutional amendment, the lawmakers came armed with the flag that flew over the Capitol the day Pearl Harbor was bombed, in Rome after that city was liberated in World War II, and over the USS Missouri when Gen. Douglas MacArthur accepted Japan's surrender. </TEXT></DOC>
