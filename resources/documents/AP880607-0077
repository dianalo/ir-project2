Kandahar, population about 200,000, has been under siege forseveral weeks and Moslem guerrillas are reportedly preparing foranother major offensive against Soviet-Afghan troops stationed there.   Reports reaching Islamabad say Afghan insurgents have pushedgovernment troops to defensive positions around the outskirts of thecity.   The Soviet Union in 1979 sent troops to Afghanistan to supportthe Marxist regime. On May 15, the Soviets began a withdrawal, whichhas been slowed by attacks from guerrillas.   Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a Sovietregiment was told to cancel plans to leave Kandahar, reflectingSoviet fears over the city's vulnerability.   Soviet forces reportedly have left Ghazni, on the road fromKandahar to the Afghan capital of Kabul, but some soldiers remain inJalalabad, where the Soviet withdrawal was launched in May.   There have been reports of heavy fighting in the northeasternprovince of Baghland.   The Salang highway, stretching 200 miles north of Kabul to theSoviet border, is becoming increasingly dangerous, sources said. Itwas closed to civilian traffic for five days ending Sunday to allowdeparting Soviet troops to move north. Diplomatic sources say theconvoys have been attacked by guerrillas and that up to 100 Sovietsoldiers were reported killed in recent clashes.   The official Kabul radio, monitored in Islamabad, continues tobroadcast a list of guerrilla defeats and atrocities. It claimedMonday that 93 guerrillas were killed and as many injured in recentclashes in seven of Afghanistan's 28 provinces.   The various reports cannot be independently confirmed.</TEXT></DOC>
