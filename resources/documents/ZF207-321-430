 And although somechanges to the work place may seem expensive, many of these measures havemore than paid for themselves over time.andM;VDTs and miscarriages.andP;  Lisa Gallatin, director of Boston's Office TechnologyEducation Project, reported that 80 percent of the calls to its VDT hot lineconcern computer use and pregnancy.andM;&quot;We recommend that pregnant women reduce the number of hours at the VDT to 20hours or less a week,&quot; said Gallatin.andP;  &quot;Preferably that is done by providinga job with a variety of tasks.andP;  It is not clear that getting off the VDTcompletely is called for.&quot;andM;A VDT generates several kinds of radiation: light, certain inaudible soundwaves, radio frequency radiation, X-rays, electromagnetic fields and staticelectricity.andP;  Few of these radiations are considered harmful in the levelsemitted.andM;Take X-rays, also called ionizing radiation.andP;  Most experts agree that theglass surrounding the cathode ray tube blocks dangerous levels of X-rays fromreaching the computer user.andP;  Moreover, every interviewed for this story saidlead aprons, worn by some pregnant women while working at the computer, arenot only useless but can actually harm the fetus because of their weight.andM;Still, some emissions are thought to be harmful to the unborn child.andP;  Currentresearch now focuses on electromagnetic fields (also called non-ionizingradiation) as a possible danger.andM;Electromagnetic fields contain two distinct elements: electric fields andmagnetic fields.andP;  The monitor screens available on the market can stop theelectric fields but not the magnetic ones.andP;  And it is the magnetic fieldsthat arouse the most concern among experts.andM;According to Louis Slesin, editor of New York-based VDT News, magnetic fieldscan be reduced only in new monitors.andP;  &quot;To date, the only way to do it is toredesign the circuitry to reduce the magnetic fields at the source or tocancel them out at the source with an equal and opposite field.&quot;andM;Michael Hiles, president of NoRad Corp. in Santa Monica, Calif., claims tohave developed a product that, when used with his company's radiation screen,will protect the VDT user from the entire spectrum of electromagneticemissions.andP;  Hiles also claimed that the product, which his company ispreparing to bring to market, will block emissions from the sides and back ofthe monitor as well as the front.andP;  If so, it will be the first productavailable to reduce magnetic fields from existing VDTs.andM;What's also noteworthy about Hiles' claims is that the product will blockemissions from all sides.andM;In fact, many experts said they believe that the danger from electromagneticfields comes from your neighbor's computer because most of the radiation isgenerated by the flyback transformer at the back of the monitor.andM;&quot;What we recommend as the easiest precaution is to pay attention to where apregnant woman sits in relation to other terminals, at least four to fivefeet away,&quot; said Gallatin.andP;  According to Gallatin, one simple step would beto arrange the workstations in a horseshoe formation, for example.andM;Seeing clearly.andP;  The greatest number of vision-related complaints concern eyestrain and focusing problems.andM;Dr.andP;  James Sheedy of the University of California, Berkeley, School ofOptometry has found that VDTs can indeed cause focusing difficulties.andO;According to Sheedy, it's not clear whether the problem is caused by thecomputer terminal or if it exacerbates existing borderline problems.andP;  Eitherway, Sheedy recommends looking away from the computer screen occasionally andfocusing on a distant object.andM;Additionally, most experts agree that adjusting room lighting and eliminatingglare from the computer screen are of paramount importance.andM;And some companies are taking a more active role in preventive treatment.andO;The Los Angeles Times, for example, provides regular eye exams for employeesand pays for special glasses if needed, according to Michael Manfro, theTimes' safety and environmental affairs manager.andM;Color coordination.andP;  In his research, Sheedy has found that dark letters on awhite background can cause less eye strain, especially when the computer usermust look at both the screen and hard copy.andP;  Moving from the white paper to ascreen with a light background keeps the pupil from continually expanding andcontracting, as it would if the screen had a dark background.andM;Additionally, Sheedy recommends that documents and the screen should beplaced equally distant from the eye to prevent the need to constantlyrefocus.andM;Managers of monochrome terminals need to be aware of the McCullough Effect,where the world is seen through a pink or blue tint.andP;  The pink tint comesfrom looking at a green screen for long periods, the blue from viewing anamber screen.andP;  The effect is more common with green monitors.andM;The McCullough Effect is not thought to be harmful, although little researchhas been conducted on the phenomenon.andP;  &quot;We have been publishing a number ofstories that indicate the McCullough Effect may not be as benign as peoplenow think,&quot; said Slesin.andM;Aches and pains.andP;  Working at a computer for long spells has been linked to awhole range of musculo-skeletal problems.andP;  For example, pain in the forearmor wrist can be a sign of carpal tunnel syndrome, one of a number of problemscalled repetitive strain injuries, or RSIs.andP;  Typically, RSIs affect theforearm, hand, wrist or elbow, although they occur on other parts of the bodyas well.andM;Preventing a repetitive strain injury comes down to ergonomics.andP;  Also calledhuman factors engineering, ergonomics simply means designing the work placewith the human beings and the tasks they perform in mind.andM;The key is adjustability.andM;&quot;You get into a rental car and the first thing you do is adjust the seat andthe mirror.andP;  Those are ergonomic changes,&quot; said Linden Heck, executivedirector of the Center for Office Technology, an information clearing-housein New York.andM;According to Heck, the biggest corporate problem concerning ergonomics is alack of employee training.andP;  &quot;Having the best equipment in the world is only asmall part of making an ergonomic workstation,&quot; she said.andM;Heck said that she believes managers need to train employees to properlyadjust the workstation to fit themselves and the type of work they do.andP;  Andwhile research in Heck's organization indicates that managers have becomeincreasingly aware of the need to consider health and ergonomic issues, italso indicates that few people recognize how cost-effective those steps canbe.andM;For example, a Stanford University study examined a large utility companythat provided ergonomics trining to its data processing clerks.andP;  The Stanfordstudy revealed a 50 percent to 60 percent increase in the number of checksprocessed daily, which earned $40,000 each day in added interest.andM;Computers and stress.andP;  Stress can be an important cause of health problems,and some studies suggest that the computer can be a factor in heighteningstress.andM;&quot;Stress can be related both to the design of the work environment and to thejob design,&quot; said Gallatin.andP;  &quot;Some examples of the job design are unrealisticexpectations from the computer system and inadequate training.andP;  And boringjobs with repetitive, mindless tasks tend to be more stressful.&quot;andM;One solution is to provide more frequent breaks for workers.andP;  For example,one expert interviewed for this article suggested that a five minute breakevery hour would help lower stress levels and avoid some of themusculo-skeletal problems associated with long spells at the computer.andM;The other most frequently cited cause of elevated stres levels in acomputerized office is the use of the technology to monitor employees.andO;&quot;Monitoring is very stressful [for employees],&quot; said Gallatin.andP;  &quot;It makespeople feel that they are being watched every second of the day.&quot;andM;To help alleviate such stress, Slesin suggested that companies that need tokeep track of job performance switch to monitoring groups instead ofindividuals.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
