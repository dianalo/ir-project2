The ruling by the country's Revenue Department follows a complaint by onion growers in the western Canadian province. Dumping occurs when a product is sold for export at less than its domestic market price.    The Canadian Import Tribunal must rule within 120 days on whether British Columbia farmers are being harmed by the actions of onion growers in California, Oregon, Idaho and Washington. During this period, the U.S. onions will be subject to a provisional duty of 38.6%, which is the estimated price reduction involved, a Revenue Department official said. </TEXT></DOC>
