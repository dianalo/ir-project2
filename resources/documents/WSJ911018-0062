Gettingtheir name in the papers, they figure, is as good as freeadvertising. And hiring a flack is a lot cheaper thanspending millions on an ad campaign.   Or is it?</LP><TEXT>   New research suggests that corporate public relations isactually more expensive, and less effective, than it was inyears past.   Public relations &quot;isn't as cheap as you thought it was&quot;anymore, says Katharine D. Paine, president of DelahayeGroup, a Hampton Falls, N.H., firm that measures the impactof corporate communications. Delahaye studied 30 clients andfound that, on average, each was mentioned in 878 articles in1990, down 36% from 1,371 articles in 1989. That works out to$763 for each article -- a 30% price hike from $585 just ayear earlier.   Executives at public relations firms, many of which areare owned by ad agencies, are already jumping on the data,branding it simplistic and misleading. &quot;It's a frivolousanalysis,&quot; charges Herbert Rowland, chief execuitve officerof the Rowland Co., the big public relations company owned byad agency giant Saatchi andamp; Saatchi Co.   Public relations firms do a lot more than plant articlesabout their clients, Mr. Rowland says, involving themselvesin event planning, strategy and other marketing disciplines.Press coverage is only one small part of the public relationspackage, he says, making price-per-article figuresmeaningless.   But Delahaye Group contends the figures do reveal thedifficulties of getting good public relations in a severemedia recession. As ad pages decline, so does the news holeat magazines and newspapers, and other publications simply gobelly up. That reduces the space in which clients can appear.   And there are fewer reporters to pitch stories to. Majornewspapers are cutting their staffs back. The latest movesinclude the Los Angeles Times and Long Island's Newsdayoffering early retirement and unpaid leave to reporters. Justlast week, Time Warner laid off 105 editorial employees atits magazines.   The result: public relations executives have to workharder for ever more meager results.   &quot;There's no question it's a tougher environment,&quot; saysHolly Hartz, director of public relations for ElectronicArts, a video and computer game company that relies on publicrelations rather than advertising to get its message out.&quot;There just aren't as many magazines as there were last year.Publications go away.&quot;   One of Electronic Arts's biggest recent PR coups wasprominent mention in an article in News Corp.'s glossy Men'sLife last winter. But the magazine folded after just oneissue -- and Electronic Arts lost a chance to get follow-uppublicity.   Companies that slash ad budgets often look to publicrelations to pick up the slack. Yet public relationsexecutives are finding it hard enough to generate any presscoverage, much less make up for depressed ad budgets.   At computer firm Hewlett-Packard, where ad budgets remainflat, &quot;I feel pressure on that front,&quot; says James Hasl, agroup public relations manager.   Mr. Hasl and others say corporations need to betterunderstand &quot;what their PR dollars are buying them,&quot; so theycan appreciate that PR-generated press coverage isn't &quot;free&quot;advertising.   Perhaps it is a sign of these troubled times thatElectronic Arts is attempting to do just that. It has come upwith a system that equates press coverage with advertisingtime and space, actually assigning a dollar value to mentionsin the press. The system takes into account the size of anarticle, and how favorably -- or unfavorably -- it treats thecompany.   Ms. Hartz's department must fill a quota of $3.5 millionthis year. That's no easy target considering the company iscovered mostly by small publications that charge only $5,000or so for an ad page anyway. Last year, the departmentbrought in $2.9 million worth of press. This year, eventhough Electronic Arts has expanded into new areas, she says,it will be tougher to meet the quota.   ---   Cohen Wins Bally's                                                                                                          Bally's Health andamp; Tennis Corp., a unit of BallyManufacturing, awarded the creative portion of its $50million ad account to Cohen/Johnson of Los Angeles.   The account had been handled by J. Walter Thompson's LosAngeles office, but the two split earlier this year in acompensation dispute. Thompson, a unit of WPP Group, latelast year demanded that Health andamp; Tennis pay cash up front formedia buys. Health andamp; Tennis resisted and then moved its mediabuying account to Western International Media. Thompsonresigned the creative account earlier this year, said MarkdeGorter, Health andamp; Tennis's vice president of advertising.   Mr. deGorter said Cohen/Johnson was selected in large partbecause he felt the shop's proposed campaign, themed &quot;ShapeYour Life,&quot; best addressed consumers' changing attitudestoward physical fitness. &quot;We've found that as people getolder, they have this perception that their disposable timeis starting to be reduced,&quot; he said. &quot;We're trying to tellthem that, through some of our products, they do have timefor fitness.&quot;   The win is a big victory for Cohen/Johnson, a small shopthat has been trying to forge a creative reputation withclients such as Jack in the Box and Hills Bros. coffee. Itbested four other Los Angeles agencies to win the account,including D'Arcy Masius Benton and Bowles; Bozell; OmnicomGroup's DDB Needham; and Suissa Advertising.   ---   Clio Creditors Huddle                                                                                                          A group of creditors owed money by the organizers of theClio Awards met in New York last weekend to plan legal actionto put Clio Awards Enterprises into involuntary bankruptcy,according to one of the companies.   Edward Foster, president of Foster Printing in Paramus,N.J., said he and four other companies want to get back theirshare of the $2 million to $4 million that they believe theClio organization owes its creditors. The move comes one weekafter an investor group led by Ruth Ratny, editor ofChicago's Screen magazine, said it struck a deal to buy theawards company for an undisclosed sum. Ms. Ratny declined tocomment yesterday but said her group would have anannouncement by tomorrow.   If Mr. Foster's group is successful, the court would seizeClio assets and satisfy creditors before the sale isaccomplished. &quot;We're going to make sure we get our money,&quot;Mr. Foster said.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .                                                                                                          NUTRI/SWITCH: Nutri/System Inc., the Blue Bell, Pa.,weight-loss company, moved the creative part of its $30million account from FCB/LGK in Philadelphia to Lotas MinardPatton McIver in New York, ad executives said. FCB/LGK, aunit of Foote, Cone andamp; Belding, retains the media portion ofthe account. Nutri/System made the switch, which was firstreported in Advertising Age, after comparative ads fromFCB/LGK drew a deceptive-advertising lawsuit from competitorH.J. Heinz's Weight Watchers International unit. The suit wassettled privately two weeks ago. Lotas Minard createdNutri/System's new non-comparative campaign, &quot;Nutrisize YourLife,&quot; which broke the same day.                                                                                                          BREEZER BUSTERS: San Diego alcohol-control activistsdemanded that Bacardi Imports stop advertising BacardiBreezers, spirits-based coolers, on television. They saidBacardi should &quot;stop stealing role models&quot; such as pop starGloria Estefan, whose concert tour Bacardi sponsored. Bacardispokesman Bob Hunter said the company would continue runningits ads for Breezers, as well as public-service and paidmoderation ads starring Ms. Estefan. &quot;In fact, one reasonwe've had such enormous success,&quot; Mr. Hunter said, &quot;is thatthe San Diego group created a forum for us to discuss thiscritical issue with the consumer.&quot;                                                                                                          NEW ACCOUNT: Kinder-Care Learning Centers consolidated itsestimated $6 million to $7 million advertising account withTracy-Locke/Dallas, an Omnicom unit. The agency's directmarketing unit has worked for the client for two years.Incumbent Hutcheson-Shutze, of Atlanta, was acquired byOmnicom's BBDO unit last year.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          AN ARTICLE in the Sept. 24 edition quoted a man whoidentified himself as Edward Foster of Foster Printing,Paramus, N.J., purporting to represent a creditor groupseeking to force Clio Awards Enterprises Inc. intoinvoluntary bankruptcy. It appears that the claim was a hoaxand that no such creditor exists. Clio said it hasn't hiredany such printing company. No listing for the company couldbe found in the Paramus area, and efforts to locate it wereunsuccessful.   (WSJ Oct. 18, 1991)   910924-0140</TEXT></DOC>
