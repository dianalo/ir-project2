Last year,Bangkok told UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, NWA Inc.'sNorthwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines, the U.S. carriersflying to the country, that they would have to reducepassenger flights to 21 a week from 31 by the end of March,after a bilateral air-services agreement expired in November.   But the transport minister said he intends to extend thepact to Oct. 31, to allow time to work out a permanentaccord. The U.S. airlines haven't been told of the unilateralextension and aren't sure they could legally accept it.Airline and tourism executives said the issues at stakearen't clear, but many believe Thai officials think U.S.carriers are poaching Asian airlines' business.   Meanwhile, France said it will allow travel concerns thatcan prove they were hurt by the Gulf conflict to delaymandatory payments to government social-benefit programs. InJapan, hotels received a wave of cancellations from foreignbusiness executives and tourists fearing terrorist attacksand hijackings. Cash-strapped Kenya is losing millionsbecause of peak-season cancellations by Western touristsfrightened about terrorism.                                                                                                          HONG KONG LOVES ESCALATORS                                                                                                          Hong Kong, home of the world-record 743-foot escalatorride, plans an even bigger one, a half-mile of movingsidewalks and staircases snaking out of the central businessdistrict and climbing to a prime residential area. This partof Hong Kong island is built almost entirely on the side ofsteep Victoria Peak, so walking -- especially in the colony'shot, humid weather -- is daunting. The escalator, with atotal travel time of 19 minutes, is to carry as many as12,000 people an hour. Work is to begin next month and becompleted in 1993. The cost is estimated at 187 million HongKong dollars (US$24 million). Rides will be free.                                                                                                          RAIL STRIKE IN ROMANIA SETTLED                                                                                                          A two-week-old railway strike ended after Bucharest andunion leaders negotiated a settlement. The labor minister,Ion Aurel Stoica, offered to resign, saying his negotiationsviolated a court ruling that the walkout was illegal. Thestrike over pay and working conditions, which paralyzed railtravel and transport in 13 of Romania's 42 counties, broughtthe economy to the verge of collapse.                                                                                                          BENETTON TO EXPAND TO BRAZIL                                                                                                          Benetton Group S.p.A. of Italy, a leisure-wear concern,plans to open a $12 million factory in Brazil's Paranaprovince. Production will begin in March. The factory, thegroup's first in South America, is expected to result in a30% rise in Benetton's sales on the continent, now $20million, or 1% of total sales.                                                                                                          IMF CLEARS PHILIPPINES FINANCING                                                                                                          The International Monetary Fund approved a financingpackage for the Philippines that authorizes disbursements of$909 million in the next 18 months to help stabilize theeconomy. The sum includes $400 million to help cover highercrude-oil import costs and lower export earnings owing to theGulf war. Separately, a poll shows public approval of CorazonAquino fell to a low of 38% from 54% last April and 76% in1986. She marks her fifth anniversary as president Monday,but doesn't plan to seek re-election.                                                                                                          CZECHOSLOVAKIA LINKS TO WEST                                                                                                          Czechoslovakia became the 25th member of the Council ofEurope, at 41 the oldest post-World War II body that promotesEuropean cooperation. It is the second former East blocnation to join the council, based in Strasbourg, France, andknown for its human rights treaties; Hungary was admitted inNovember.                                                                                                          GERMANS FACE TAX BOOST JULY 1                                                                                                          Faced with a mounting stack of bills, Finance MinisterTheo Waigel scheduled tax increases for July 1. But Germanyis still wrangling about which taxes to boost and how big thetotal increase should be.   The debate comes as Bonn is getting battered by gloomyeconomic news from eastern Germany, where unemployment isspiraling and factories are closing at an accelerating rate,raising the specter of greater-than-expected government costsat all levels. The outlook is clouded further by additionalcosts of paying for economic aid to the Soviet Union andEastern Europe, as well as Germany's big cash contributionsto the Gulf war.   The problem is figuring out how much more money thanbudgeted is needed to cover projected expenses, as appealscontinue in the east for public investment programs and stateand local emergency financial aid.   Mr. Waigel, who will present a final set of proposals onMarch 8, wouldn't specify any tax increases. He did oppose anincome tax rise, saying it would cut jobs and economicgrowth. Bonn is said to be studying a gasoline tax boost.

Chad's Idriss Deby signed a cooperation accord with Libyaduring a visit to the North African nation that supported hisoverthrow of former President Hissene Habre.
