Programs produced by the news divisions of the threenetworks are soaring in the ratings. Prime-time news specialsare performing better than the entertainment shows they'vereplaced. And the networks, for a while, at least, haveexpanded the nightly dinner-time evening newscasts to onehour.</LP><TEXT>   For the time being, network news programs will draw hugeaudiences from a public riveted by the war. But advertisersare gun-shy about having a product associated with thecoverage and are backing out of commitments. As previouslyreported, the networks may lose more than $100 million inadvertiser commitments. And no one knows whether the ratingssuccess could continue if, as expected, the Gulf warcontinues for months, not weeks.   Indeed, the increased ratings haven't come without aprice. On Jan. 21, for example, a one-hour CBS News programanchored by Dan Rather replaced the usual 10 p.m.entertainment show, &quot;The Trials of Rosie O'Neill.&quot; Althoughthe news special finished No. 1 in the A.C. Nielsen Co. forthe time period, network officials said that CBS incurred aloss of $400,000 in advertising revenue.   But the network is pleased with the news special ratings.For instance, a CBS News special on Friday attracted 12.8% ofU.S. homes with television sets, according to overnightratings in 25 major cities. CBS usually attracts 8% of theaudience with &quot;Dallas.&quot; And an ABC News special, &quot;A Line inthe Sand,&quot; finished in the Top 10 last week.   The network news divisions, which each spent about $3million in the first week of war coverage and are nowspending about $1.5 million each week, see the heightenedinterest in the war as an opportunity to increaseprogramming.   &quot;America Tonight,&quot; the late-night CBS News show withCharles Kuralt and Lesley Stahl, scheduled for cancellationJan. 18, has been renewed indefinitely. Its ratings jumped28% to 3.2 million viewers from 2.5 million viewers in thetwo weeks before war broke out Jan. 16. (&quot;Nightline,&quot; ABCNews's 11:30 p.m. franchise, had a 36% increase in ratings,to 7.5 million viewers from 5.5 million.)   Even CBS, for decades an also-ran in the morning, is up30% in ratings in a two-week period, to 3.5 million from 2.7million viewers. NBC News' &quot;Today&quot; rose 32% to 5.2 millionviewers from 3.4 million.   The Gulf war also may present the chance for the newsdivisions to finally get a foothold into Saturday morning,for years dominated by cartoons. For the past two weeks, NBCNews has aired a special &quot;Saturday Today&quot; and ABC Newsproduced special news shows for children complete with Mr.Jennings at one point sitting cross-legged chatting with kidsabout the war.   News programs are usually slow to build. It took years for&quot;60 Minutes&quot; to become a hit. But news divisions are hopingthe heightened interest in news will increase viewersampling. Today, NBC News is beginning a half-hour daytimenews show titled &quot;A Closer Look With Faith Daniels.&quot; The showhas practically 100% clearances on the NBC affiliates.   Network news executives cautioned about offering any greatnumber of new shows, however. One official described theshows as &quot;on-air pilots,&quot; but added: &quot;Everyone's mind andenergy has been on covering the war. You can't really saywhat's going to happen in the future because we don't know.&quot;   And yesterday, the NBC News Channel, the 24-hour servicethat supplies video to NBC affiliates, was pressed intoaction as a back-up news supplier. During a news briefing byOperation Desert Storm's commander, Gen. H. NormanSchwarzkopf, NBC decided to return to regular programming, aNational Basketball Association game. However, the NBC NewsChannel continued to supply the news conference to NBCaffiliates so that they had a choice. It was anchored byGarrick Utley.   The idea is to provide stations that want it withcontinuing coverage and not have NBC affiliates that are alsoaffiliated with the all-news Cable News Network switch awayfrom NBC to CNN, the only American-owned network that isbroadcasting directly from Iraq. There are 53 of the morethan 200 NBC affiliates also affiliated with CNN, a unit ofTurner Broadcasting System Inc.   Says Don Browne, NBC News executive vice president: &quot;Thisgives us and our affiliates the best of both worlds.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
