Thomson's CGR medical equipment unit had sales of about $770 million. GE is already a leader in the medical equipment business, with $1.6 billion in world-wide revenue, and GE's chairman and chief executive officer, John F. Welch Jr., told analysts yesterday that the Thomson operations are &quot;an excellent fit&quot; in a business GE views as among its fastest-growing.    The agreement is the latest in many moves GE has made under Mr. Welch to focus on businesses in which the company can be a leader in both market share and profits. It also is an example of what many people view as Mr. Welch's opportunistic management style. Only two months ago, GE appeared committed to giving the consumer electronics division, which barely broke even last year, two to three years to turn around.    But Mr. Welch said yesterday he saw &quot;the chance of a lifetime&quot; when Thomson, which he approached last month about buying its medical equipment business, said it would only sell if it could get GE's consumer electronics unit.    At the analysts' meeting, Mr. Welch also indicated he is open to similar trades to bolster the company's financial services, materials and medical technology operations. The GE chairman didn't elaborate on what businesses he would consider trading, but some analysts have speculated that the company would like to leave the semiconductor manufacturing business.    The sale would also mean the departure of the only senior RCA executive in GE's top management. Richard W. Miller, a former RCA executive vice president who was chosen to head the combined consumer electronics division last July, would now run Thomson's U.S. operations. Mr. Miller was in line to become RCA's next chief executive before the company was acquired by GE.    For Thomson, which has no consumer electronics operation here, the move would catapult it into the ranks of N.V. Philips of the Netherlands and Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. as a world leader in consumer electronics. Thomson's revenue from consumer electronics and appliances was $3.3 billion last year.    Fairfield, Conn.-based GE and Thomson said they will each retain a 19.9% interest in the businesses they are selling for an as-yet undetermined transition period. Thomson also said it will continue to make GE-brand and RCA-brand products and will keep the GE division's 31,000 employees world-wide, 10,000 of whom are in the U.S.    GE common stock rose 37.5 cents to close at $56.125 a share in composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday. The announcement of the sale accord came near the close of trading.    In a telephone interview, Mr. Miller acknowledged he was &quot;surprised&quot; at GE's move. However, he said he met with Thomson Chairman Alain Gomez in Paris the first week of July, and &quot;I liked him immediately -- we had excellent early conversations and his first interest was in our people. He asked me to run the business, and I agreed to do that.&quot; He described Mr. Gomez as &quot;a new breed of European manager&quot; interested in world-wide expansion.    Analysts at the GE meeting yesterday responded favorably to the transaction. Gail Landis, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said the transaction appears to be &quot;very logical&quot; for both companies.    Martin Sankey, an analyst at First Boston Corp., said the move will have a &quot;modestly positive&quot; impact on GE earnings right away and noted that GE will retain licensing income from RCA patents, about $150 million annually.    In the second quarter, GE reported net income of $720 million, or 79 cents a share, up from $621 million, or 68 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose to $9.56 billion from $7.79 billion.    &quot;Strategically it really makes sense,&quot; Mr. Mankey said. &quot;GE gets out of a business it doesn't like and expands its presence in a business it believes is one of its fastest-growing.&quot; In the medical equipment business, he noted, GE will have &quot;economies of scale&quot; and will be able to cut Thomson's research spending levels, because GE already has products that Thomson was in the process of developing.    Mr. Welch said the acquisition would triple GE's European medical equipment market share, which is 6% at present. He noted GE is already strong in the diagnostic-imaging equipment business and noted that Thomson contributes strength in X-ray technology.    &quot;GE is the giant in the diagnostic-imaging market, and it sounds as if they're going to be a bigger and more formidable giant,&quot; said Lorraine Schwarz, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.    Medical equipment is one of about 15 industries on which GE currently is focusing, based on the company's strategy that the most effective way for it to grow is to be only in businesses in which it can be No. 1 or No. 2 in market share. Those 15 businesses are in three basic areas: high technology, services and manufacturing. The consumer electronics division is No. 1 in televisions and videocassette recorders in the U.S., but it isn't one of Mr. Welch's favorites because severe competition has made profits elusive.    Despite the GE chairman's lack of enthusiasm, the company said earlier this year that it would resume domestic production of television sets at an RCA plant in Bloomington, Ind., and spend $20 million to modernize the facility. The move attracted considerable attention, because it was viewed by many people as a test of whether U.S. consumer goods manufacturers could compete against Far Eastern producers with American-made products.    But Mr. Welch never said he was committed to the consumer electronics business. Moreover, some consultants noted that sprucing up the manufacturing facilities increased their appeal to foreign buyers worried about U.S. protectionism. But since selling to a Japanese company might have raised antitrust questions, the agreement with Thomson &quot;provided a nice graceful way out,&quot; said David Lachenbruch, editor of the trade publication TV Digest.    Completion of the transaction is subject to approval by U.S. and European regulators.
