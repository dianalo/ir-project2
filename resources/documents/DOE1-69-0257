<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-69-0257 </DOCNO><TEXT>A series of experiments has been conducted to characterize the conditionof small slappers (flyers), used in detonators, at the time they impact.Flyer shape was determined by a new technique employing electronic streak-cameraresults in two orthogonal directions and a computer program to reconstructa three-dimensional view of the flyer. Flyer thickness was inferred fromFabry-Perot interferometer measurements of the velocity history of aflyer/witness-block interface. Finally, recovery of flyers launched intoair indicates that they remain intact throughout their flight. 5 refs.,10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
