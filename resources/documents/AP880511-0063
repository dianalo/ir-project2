The Congressional human rights caucus heard the accusations ofabuses in Chinese-ruled Tibet during a hearing that, in an apparentcoincidence, began at the same hour Tuesday that Chinese VicePremier Tian Jiyun was at the White House talking with Reagan.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Reagan-Tiangmeeting centered on trade, but Fitzwater did not say whether humanrights issues were raised. The State Department said also said ameeting Tuesday between Tiang and Secretary George Shultz centeredlargely with economic matters.   Reps. Ben Gilman, R-N.Y., and Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., told thehuman rights panel they are introducing legislation for economicsanctions against China linked to human rights abuses in theHimalayan region of Tibet.   Gilman said his bill would ban U.S. support of credit for Chinafrom international lending agencies and would provide for Voice ofAmerica broadcasts in the Tibetan language and for U.S. aid forTibetan refugees and for preserving Tibetan culture.   The U.S. recognizes Tibet only as a part of China and the StateDepartment does not require its officials in the region to have aknowledge of the Tibetan language. McCloskey said that leaves theU.S. ``indirectly aiding and abetting in the extinction of Tibetanculture,'' McCloskey said.   Actor Richard Gere, president of New York's Tibet House, toldthe panel China has ``an ugly solution'' for the Tibetan problemproviding for ``total annihilation of the Tibetan people as a race,as a culture ... probably within one generation.''   The 35 years since the entrance of Chinese forces into theHimalayan territory have brought ``one of the most devastatinggenocides we have had in history ... on the order of Cambodia''under the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s, said Gere.   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., co-chairman of the caucus, said hehopes the Reagan administration raises human rights with Chineseleaders because the issue will not disappear.   ``The cost of human rights violations to the Chinese will beincreased year after year after year until they realize it will benot only in the interest of the Tibetan people but of the Chinesethemselves to put an end to those barbaric practices,'' he said.   After the hearing _ and while Tian was having lunch with U.S.Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter _ members of the caucus andThubten Jigme Norbu, brother of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetanspiritual leader in exile, inaugurated a Tibetan art, antiques andphotographic exhibit at a congressional office building. Norbu is aprofessor at the University of Indiana.</TEXT></DOC>
