(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Marlin, Chris; Freidel, Dennis.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Parallel programming languages are usually compared informally.andO;Such informal comparisons have led to considerable disagreementand debate about the relationship between various parallelprogramming languages and features.andP;  This article presents a modelthat permits more precise comparisons for a particular class ofparallel programming languages: those in which the communicationbetween the parallel processes is via a first-in, first-out queueof messages.andP;  This model was developed to assist with the detailedcomparisons between the communication aspect of various parallelprogramming languages, required as part of the design of a newparallel programming language.andP;  The model is illustrated bydescribing interprocess communication in two bufferedmessage-passing languages: the language of Kahn and MacQueen, andthe language of Cospol.andP;  (Reprinted by permission of thepublisher.)andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Programming LanguagesParallel ProcessingMessage SwitchingCommunicationComparisonFIFO.andO;Feature:   illustrationprogram.andO;Caption:   An example program in the language of Kahn and MacQueen.
