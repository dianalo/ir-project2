(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakistoday denounced Reagan administration economic policies and saidprogress will require greater educational efforts. He promised todo more than talk about education for political gain.   Dukakis' likely November Republican opponent, Vice PresidentGeorge Bush, declares in almost every campaign speech that he wantsto be ``the education president.''   However, Dukakis said, ``The next president must be thisnation's No. 1 advocate for educational opportunity and goodschools, not just during election years but every day and everyweek and every month.''   ``In a Dukakis administration, we're going to make the same kindof commitment to excellence and high standards that launched anexplosion in scientific and economic progress under John Kennedy ageneration ago,'' Dukakis said at the University of Charleston.   ``We're going to invest in our people; we'e going to invest innew technology; we're going to invest in research,'' Dukakis said.   On Reagan-Bush economic policies, Dukakis said theadministration has ignored regional development while allowingcorporate raiders to orchestrate mergers that have brought themmillions in profits while costing jobs.   Dukakis also was touring a West Virginia coal mine before headngto Nebraska to campaign. Both states have presidential primariesTuesday.   In Boston, meanwhile, income tax reports made public todayshowed Dukakis and his wife Kitty made $108,957 in total incomelast year and paid just under 24 percent of that amount in federaltaxes.   Upon arriving in West Virginia early today, Dukakis wooed voterswith a promise to help the state's coal industry.   Dukakis said he would encourage the construction of electricityplants near the state's coal mines, with the power to be sold tothe energy-dependent Northeast.   ``We now are buying power from Canada,'' he said. ``I'm willingto pay a little more and I think most Americans are, too,'' to relyon U.S. suppliers.   In Boston, before heading to West Virginia, he said he welcomedcontinued competition from Democratic rival Jesse Jackson.   Dukakis said he had a friendly discussion with Jackson onWednesday morning, the day after Dukakis' big wins in Ohio andIndiana.   At the same time, Dukakis campaign aides said privately thatJackson should tone done his recent criticism of Dukakis.   On Tuesday, the day that his Ohio and Indiana primary victoriespushed him closer to the nomination, Dukakis named Marcia Hale, aveteran Democratic political operative, as his manager for theDemocratic National Convention.   The Dukakis campaign also has brought in Richard Moe, KirkO'Donnell, Anne Wexler and Charles Campion as campaign advisers andlikely will add more veterans of national campaigns in coming weeks.   Moe was Vice President Walter Mondale's chief of staff andinformally advised Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt's presidentialcampaign. O'Donnell is a former aide to ex-House Speaker Thomas P.``Tip'' O'Neil. Wexler worked for Geraldine Ferraro's 1984 vicepresidential campaign and Campion is a Boston political consultantwho will serve as the campaign's national political coordinator.   Just a month ago, it appeared Dukakis would head into theconvention short of the 2,081 delegates needed for nomination. Nowthat it appears more likely he will have that number or close toit, more advisers are being brought in to help prepare forconvention platform discussions and the general election.</TEXT></DOC>
