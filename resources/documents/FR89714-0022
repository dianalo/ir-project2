L. 100-418, 102 Stat. 1107.Section 5021 of that statute added a new section, section 721 (hereinafterreferred to as ``Section 721''), to the Defense Production Act of 1950,50 U.S.C. App. 2061 et seq., relating to the President's authority to reviewcertain mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers. Section 721 provides that the President may suspend or prohibit any merger,acquisition, or takeover of persons engaged in interstate commerce by orwith foreign persons which would result in foreign control, where suchcontrol threatens to impair the national security. Before the Presidentmay exercise this authority, he must find that (1) there is credible evidencethat leads him to believe that the foreign interest exercising controlmight take action that threatens to impair the national security, and (2)provisions of law, other than the International Emergency Economic PowersAct (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) and section 721, do not in the President's judgmentprovide adequate and appropriate authority for the President to protectthe national security. Section 721 empowers the President to exercise theseauthorities with respect to transactions that were concluded on or afterthe date of enactment, i.e., August 23, 1988. Thus, any transaction whichwas completed prior to that date is not subject to section 721.Section 721 also sets out certain procedural steps for reviewing transactionsthat may be subject to Presidental action. The statute creates a two-stagereview and investigation process for transactions subject to section 721.The review of ``notice'' phase of this two-stage process must be completedwithin 30 days. If there is a decision not to follow up the notice phasewith an investigation, action under section 721 with respect to the proposedtransaction will be concluded, and the Committee must advise the Presidentof that decision. If, however, an investigation is undertaken, it mustbe completed within 45 days. In the case of each transaction for whichthere has been a completed investigation, the President must take a determinationno later than 15 days after the completion of the investigation as to whetherand how he should exercise his powers to suspend, prohibit, or take otherappropriate action with respect to the transaction. Legislative HistoryThe principal legislative history of section 721 is found in the ConferenceReport for Pub. L. 100-418 (H. Rep. 100-576, 100th Cong. 2d Sess. (1988),pp. 924-928) (hereinafter referred to as the ``Conference Report''). Thediscussion below of various individual sections of the proposed regulationsincorporates materials from the Conference Report. This discussion focuseson two areas of general significance for the regulations_national securityand foreign investment_that are dealt with in the Conference Report.The focus of the statute is on transactions that could harm the nationalsecurity. Although neither the Conference Report nor the statute definesnational security, the conferees explain that it is to be interpreted broadlyand without limitation to particular industries. They further note thatthe term is not meant to imply any limitation on the term ``national defense''as used elsewhere in the Defense Production Act (Conference Report at 926-927).Although broad, this term is nevertheless narrower than the language inthe predecessor House bill, which referred to ``national security and essentialcommerce.'' See H.R. 3, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. Sec. 905, 133 Cong. Rec.2642, 2739 (1987). In line with the guidance in the Conference Report, the proposed regulationsdo not attempt to define ``national security.'' Nonetheless, the intentof the regulations is to indicate that notice, while voluntary, clearlyappropriate when, for example, a company is being acquired that providesproducts or key technologies essential to the U.S. defense industrial base.However, the regulations are not intended to suggest that notice shouldbe submitted in cases where the entire output of a company to be acquiredconsists of products and/or services that clearly have no special relationto national security, e.g., toys and games; food products; hotels and restaurants;or legal services. Persons contemplating transactions involving entitiesthat operate in areas that do not appear reasonably related to the nationalsecurity are invited to seek guidance from the Staff Chairman of the Committeebefore submitting notice under these regulations.With respect to foreign investment, the regulations endeavor to incorporatethe Conference Report's view that section 721 is not intended to raiseobstacles to foreign investment. this point is made explicitly at p. 926of the Conference Report (``The Conferees in no way intend to impose barriersto foreign investment''). In line with this guidance, and consistent withthe long history of U.S. openness to foreign investment, the Committeeintends to implement the statute only insofar as necessary to protect thenational security. At another point, the conferees state that they do not intend the legislationto abrogate existing obligations of the United States under treaties, includingTreaties of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation. (Conference Report at927.) Those treaties contain national treatment provisions under whichthe United States is obligated to extend foreign parties treatment no lessfavorable than that accorded domestic parties, but is permitted to institutemeasures to protect U.S. national security. The Committee intends to implementsection 721 and the regulations in a manner fully consistent with the internationalobligations of the United States.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Proposed Regulations</ITAG>OverviewThe proposed regulations create an essentially voluntary system of noticeby the parties to an acquisition, but also allow for notice by agenciesthat are members of the Committee. Transactions that are covered by theseregulations include both proposed transactions which could result in foreigncontrol of a U.S. person, and completed transactions which do result insuch control. The focus is on the acquisition and control of on-going,sustainable businesses in the United States. ``Control,'' a key conceptin these regulations, is defined in functional rather than mechanical terms.The regulations spell out the obligations of parties giving notice to theCommittee. These include the provision of certain specified types of information(andSection; 800.402), as well as the obligation to keep the Committee apprisedof material changes or developments in a notified transaction (andSection;andSection;800.402(g) and 800.702). The Committee may reject notices that do not complywith the regulations. Once a transaction has been properly notified, theCommittee has up to thirty days to determine whether an investigation isnecessary. If an investigation is deemed necessary, the Committee willnotify the parties accordingly, and has up to forty-five days to completethe investigation. During this time, the Committee may request additionalinformation and meet with the parties regarding the notified transaction.Parties may request withdrawal of their notices at any time prior to anannouncement by the President of his decision under section 721; the Committeewill normally grant such requests.With respect to transactions that have been notified, the President mayexercise his powers under section 721 at any time within the statutoryperiods, whether or not the transactions have been completed. In the particularcase where a notified transaction is completed prior to the expirationof the statutory periods, the President may nonetheless take divestmentor other appropriate action. Acquisitions subject to section 721 that arenot notified, either by one of the parties or by an agency, remain indefinitelysubject to divestment or other appropriate action by the President. Subpart A: GeneralSubpart A sets out rules of general applicability. Section 800.103 providesthat section 721 only applies to acquisitions, mergers, or takeovers ofU.S. persons which were proposed or pending after the date of enactment.Section 721 was enacted on August 23, 1988, when the Omnibus Trade andCompetitiveness Act of 1988 became law. Therefore, only transactions whichwere proposed or pending after August 23, 1988 fall within section 721.Thus, transactions that were proposed before August 23, 1988, but werenot completed until after that date (and were thus ``pending after August23''), would fall within the statute. Conversely, transactions that werecompleted prior to August 23, 1988, would not fall within the statute.Section 800.104 makes clear that a transaction entered into for the purposeof avoiding section 721 shall be disregarded, and the Act and these regulationsshall be applied to the substance of the transaction.Subpart B: Definitions<T3>Section 800.201.</T3> Section 721 applies as a threshold matter tomergers, acquisitions, and takeovers, by or with foreign persons, of personsengaged in interstate commerce in the United States. The regulations usethe term ``acquisition'' as a form of shorthand to refer generally to mergers,acquisitions and takeovers. ``Acquisition'' is defined to include acquisitionsof a business, including the acquisitions of certain plants and equipment.This formulation recognizes that an acquisition of a business may occurthrough the acquisition of assets. However, it is intended to exclude assetacquisitions that do not result in the acquisition and control of an ongoing,sustainable business, such as would occur in a transaction involving anordinary sale and purchase of equipment.The proposed regulations treat a proxy solicitation as a ``takeover,''and cover proxy solicitations that could result in foreign control of aU.S. person. Currently, the regulations permit notice when proxies aresolicited. Other options are possible. The regulations might provide foronly limited Committee review of proxy contests at the solicitation stage.Another option would be to review proxy contests only at such time as theelection of a board of directors for which the proxies were solicited resultsin foreign control of the company. Still another option might be to drawa distinction among the types of proxies that are being solicited, basedupon whether the proxy is, or could be, irrevocable. The Committee wouldappreciate the public's views as to whether any of these options, or anyother option, is preferable to the approach adopted in the regulations.The Committee would also appreciate public views on two specific points:(1) The likelihood in the future that proxy solicitations will be usedas a vehicle for foreign persons to obtain control over U.S. persons, and(2) the likelihood that any such control_if obtained_could be used in waysthat could threaten the national security. With respect to the second point,the Committee particularly seeks views as to whether corporate law andother rules (on, e.g., director's responsibilities, shareholders rights,disclosure obligations in proxy statements) might restrict a controllingforeign interest's ability to take actions adverse to the national security.<T3>Section 800.206. </T3>This section defines the term ``entity'' verybroadly to reflect the usage of that term in the legislative history. TheConference Report uses the term to convey any on-going, sustainable business,including a corporation, partnership, a division of a corporation, or anunincorporated entity. (See Conference Report at 926.)<T3>Sections 800.210 and 800.211.</T3> Section 721 covers acquisitionsof ``U.S. persons'' where the acquiring party is a ``foreign person.''Under andSection; 800.210, a ``U.S. person'' includes any entity but onlyto the extent of its business activities in interstate commerce in theUnited States, regardless of its form of organization or who actually controlsit. Thus, a branch in the United States of a foreign entity is a U.S. personfor the purpose of these regulations. However, an entity which does nothave a branch office, subsidiary, or fixed place of business in the UnitedStates is not a ``U.S. person'' if its activities in interstate commerceare limited to sales to an unaffiliated company in the United States.``Foreign person'' is defined at andSection; 800.211 in terms of the potentialfor functional control by a foreign interest, rather than in terms of amore mechanical test such as place of incorporation. As a result, an acquiringentity might be both a U.S. person and a foreign person under these regulations(i.e., if it does business in interstate commerce in the United Statesbut is actually controlled by a foreign interest), in which case it wouldfall within section 721. On the other hand, it may be neither a U.S. personnor a foreign person under the regulations (i.e., if it does not do businessin interstate commerce in the United States and is controlled by a U.S.person), in which case it would fall outside the statute.<T3>Section 800.213.</T3> A key issue in section 721 is whether a foreignperson could ``control'' a U.S. person as a result of any transaction proposedor pending after the date of enactment. As set forth in andSection; 800.213,the test for control focuses on the power, whether or not exercised, toformulate, determine, direct, or decide important matters relating to theentity. Thus, if the foreign person will or could control the U.S. person,the transaction falls within section 721. By ``could control,'' the regulationsdo not mean a remote, eventual possibility of control, as might exist whena foreign institutional investor acquires stock in a U.S. corporation solelyfor investment purposes. Rather, those words are meant to convey a situationwhere control could be exercised by virtue of significant stock ownership,contractual arrangements, or other means. Thus, a foreign person couldcontrol a U.S. company if, for example, it acquired a dominant minorityof stock in that company, and met the requirements set out in andSection;800.213, even if the board of directors of the company were comprised entirelyof U.S. nationals.Control is relevant at two points under section 721. First, section 721provides that the President or his designee may investigate a transactionwhich could result in foreign control of persons engaged in interstatecommerce in the United States. Second, control is relevant under section721 when the President exercises his authority under that section to suspend,prohibit, or take other appropriate action with respect to a transactionthat has been the subject of an investigation. Section 721(c) providesthat the President may take such action so that ``foreign control willnot threaten to impair the national security.'' Furthermore, section 721(d)provides that the President cannot take action unless he finds, inter alia,that there is credible evidence that the foreign interest exercising controlmight take action that threatens to impair the national security.<T3>Sections 800.214 and 800.215.</T3> Sections 800.214 and 800.215 definethe terms ``parent'' and ``affiliate,'' respectively, by virtue of mechanicaltests, for the purposes of facilitating identification of those entitieswhen giving notice pursuant to andSection; 800.402. Thus, a parent is a personentitled to hold 50 percent or more of the outstanding voting securitiesof an entity; or, in the case of an entity that has no voting securities,holds or will hold 50 percent or more of the profits, or has or will havethe right in the event of a dissolution to 50 percent or more of the assetsof an entity. An affiliate of an entity is any other entity in the chainof ownership between a parent and that entity.<T3>Section 800.220.</T3> This section defines the concept ``solely forthe purposes of investment'' in terms of the absence of an intent on thepart of an acquiring party to participate in basic business decisions ofthe party to be acquired. This concept is incorporated in andSection; 800.302,which describes transactions that are not acquisitions under section 721.Under paragraph (d) of that section, a purchase of voting securities bya foreign person ``solely for the purposes of investment'' is not a transactionsubject to section 721 if it results in the ownership of ten percent orless of the outstanding voting securities of the U.S. person. However,if an investor subsequently changes his intent or takes steps inconsistentwith a passive investment purpose, the acquisition falls within section721. Section 800.302(d) also provides guidance for institutional investorspurchasing voting securities solely for investment purposes. The Committee would appreciate public comments concerning (1) the feasibilityof the intent component of the standard pertaining to individual investors,which looks to an investor's intent when acquiring the securities, and(2) the advisability of a 10 percent threshold, as opposed, for example,to a higher or lesser threshold. Specifically, the Committee would be interestedin public views on the extent to which investors acquire less than 10 percentof the outstanding voting securities of a company for the purposes of acquiringcontrol. <T3>Section 800.221. </T3>This section identifies the parties to an acquisitionfor purposes of giving notice. Paragraph (e), for parties to a proxy contest,has been left incomplete pending final resolution of how proxy contestswill be covered under the regulations. (See the discussion under andSection;800.201.)Subpart C: Coverage<T3>Section 800.301. </T3>Subpart C identifies five categories of transactionsthat are subject to section 721. These categories are meant to be illustrativerather than exhaustive. They include completed transactions which eitherdid or could result in foreign control of a U.S. person, such as when aforeign interest acquires a U.S. company but retains U.S. nationals onthe board of directors; tender offers under which a foreign person offersto purchase all or a substantial portion of the shares of a U.S. person;proposed or completed acquisitions by foreign-controlled companies in theUnited States of U.S.-controlled companies in the United States; acquisitionsof businesses; and joint ventures which could result in a foreign persongaining control over a business of a U.S. person.Section 721 is silent on the question of joint ventures, as is the ConferenceReport. The predecessor bill to section 721 in the House (H.R. 3, 100thCong., 2d Sess. Sec. 905, 133 Cong. Rec. 2642, 2739 (1987)) would haveexplicitly included joint ventures, while the Senate version had no suchreference. As andSection; 800.301(b)(4) makes clear, joint ventures may beconsidered an acquisition for the purposes of these regulations, if thejoint venture involves the acquisition of a business.Section 721 applies to acquisitions of persons engaged in interstate commercein the United States. Since ``greenfield'' investments are not on-goingbusinesses and therefore not ``persons engaged in interstate commerce,''they are not subject to section 721. <T3>See</T3> andSection; 800.301(4), example 3. Moreover, it is importantto note that foreign acquisitions of U.S.-controlled businesses operatingentirely outside the United States are not within section 721.<T3>Section 800.302.</T3> The section identifies several categories oftransactions that are not considered to be ``acquisitions'' for the purposesof section 721 and are therefore not covered under these regulations. Onecategory in this section is the acquisition of assets that do not involvethe control of a person. Since the acquisition of such assets _ with nothingmore _ does not involve control of a ``person,'' it falls outside section721. However, as specified in andSection; 800.201(b), the acquisition ofassets may be an acquisition for the purposes of section 721 when the assetsconsist of production or research and development facilities, <T3>and</T3> the acquiring party will make substantial use of the technologyor personnel of the U.S. person whose assets it acquires. (See andSection;800.201(b).)As provided in paragraph (d), the term ``acquisition'' also does not includeacquisitions made solely for the purpose of investment when the acquisitionswould result in a foreign person's holding ten percent or less of the outstandingvoting securities of a U.S. person. As mentioned earlier, under andSection;800.220an acquisition is solely for the purpose of investment if the acquiringparty has no intention of participating in basic business decisions ofthe issuer, including those outlined in the definition of control at andSection;800.213. Similarly, ``acquisition'' does not include a purchase made bya bank, trust company, insurance company, pension fund, mutual fund, financecompany or brokerage company in the ordinary course of business for itsown account, provided that a significant portion of that business doesnot consist of the acquisition of entities.Finally, these proposed regulations do not apply to acquisitions of securitiesthat do not result in control. Thus, acquisitions of stock as a resultof stock spilts, or by a securities underwriter in the course of its business,or by an insurance company pursuant to its insurance contract, are notconsidered ``acquisitions'' under these regulations. Similarly, an acquisitionof convertible voting securities that does not involve control is not anacquisition for purposes of section 721. If, however, the acquiring partysubsequently converts those securities into stock that entitles its holderto vote for directors, such conversion may constitute an acquisition undersection 721. The Committee invites public comment on the advisability ofthis distinction.Subpart D: Notice<T3>Section 800.401.</T3>This section establishes a voluntary system ofnotice. If a proposed transaction consists of an acquisition in which aforeign person controls or could control a U.S. person, then the transactionfalls within section 721, and either party to the transaction _ even ifthe proposed acquisition is ``hostile'' _ may submit notice of the transactionin accordance with the procedures in andSection; 800.401. Once such noticeis given, the Committee may also request information from the non-notifyingparty. Although the regulations create a voluntary notice scheme, it isimportant to note that if a transaction comes under section 721 and neitherparty, nor a Committee agency, submits notice to the Committee, it remainsindefinitely subject to divestment should the President subsequently makethe required findings as described in andSection; 800.601(b).Notice will only be accepted from parties. (Parties to an acquisition aredefined in andSection; 800.221.) Therefore, notice from third parties, suchas shareholders, would not constitute notice under these regulations. However,any person, including non-parties, may informally contact the Committeeregarding a particular transaction. Since such informal contacts wouldnot constitute notice, they would not commence the running of the thirty-daynotice period under section 721.In addition to notice from the parties to a transaction, these regulationsalso provide for notice by an agency that is a member of the Committee.(See andSection; 800.401(b).) Normally, the Staff Chairman will contact partiesto a transaction about which the Committee has learned through its ownefforts, if the Chairman believes that the transaction may be subject tosection 721. Since these regulations create a voluntary notice system,parties that are contacted by the Staff Chairman are free to decide whetherto give notice. An example of when agency notice may be given is wherethe Committee has ascertained that the parties to a transaction which appearsto raise national security concerns do not intend to give notice.<T3>Section 800.402.</T3> This section describes the information that mustbe submitted in order to constitute sufficient notice under section 721.Paragraph (h) provides that the Staff Chairman retains the right to rejectvoluntary notices that do not comply with the section. As provided in paragraph(g), parties are required to advise the Committee of any developments thatare material to the Committee's review of the proposed transaction. TheCommittee has the right to reject any notice at any time if, after thenotice has been submitted, there is a material change in the transactionthat has been notified. The Committee would view such a material changeas giving rise to a new transaction that may warrant a separate noticeto the Committee.<T3>Section 800.403.</T3> This section provides that the 30-day periodfollowing notice from parties is deemed to begin on the first calendarday following receipt of notice by the Committee Staff Chairman. This beginningdate applies to voluntary notice as well as to agency notice. Parties toa transaction that is notified by a Committee agency will in most caseshave already had informal contacts with the Committee and will thereforehave been made aware of an agency's intention to notify.Since the statute requires the Committee to conduct its work within fixedtime periods, these regulations adopt the principle that time periods endon business days. Therefore, if the thirtieth day of the notice periodis not a business day, the notice period will be extended to the next businessday. However, there may be cases where the Committee will be able to determinebefore the thirtieth day that a transaction does not warrant an investigation.In such cases, it can advise the parties of its determination before theend of the notice period.Subpart E: Committee Procedures: Review and Investigation<T3>Sections 800.501-800.504.</T3> Subpart E sets forth Committee proceduresfor conducting its initial 30-day review and 45-day investigation. As providedin andSection; 800.501, the Committee may examine three questions: (1) Isthere an acquisition which could result in foreign control of a U.S. person?(2) Is there credible evidence to support a belief that such foreign controlcould threaten to impair the national security? and (3) Are no other provisionsof law adequate to protect the national security? If the Committee's initialreview leads it to believe that no national security concerns are raisedby the transaction, the Committee will conclude its action under section721, and the Staff Chairman will notify the parties accordingly. In suchcases, no investigation will be undertaken, and no further action is availableunder section 721.If, on the other hand, the Committee's initial review leads it to believean investigation is warranted, the Committee will begin an investigationof the transaction no later than 30 days after the date the review periodbegan. The Committee may ask the parties to provide additional information,and may schedule meetings for the parties to discuss the transaction withthe Committee. This investigation period shall end no later than 45 daysafter it commences. Upon completing the investigation, the Committee shallmake a recommendation to the President, unless the Committee is unableto reach a unanimous decision, in which case it will submit a report tothe President that sets forth the differing views.<T3>Section 800.505.</T3> This section provides that parties to a transactionmay request that their notice be withdrawn at any time prior to an announcementby the President of his decision with respect to the matter. Such requestswill ordinarily be granted. An agency may also withdraw a notice it hasgiven concerning a transaction. Paragraph (c) makes clear that notice shallbe considered not to have been made where a notice is withdrawn or rejected.Any notice made with respect to any subsequent acquisition among partiesshall be deemed a new notice for purpose of the regulations.Subpart F: Presidential Action<T3>Section 800.601.</T3> Subpart F concerns the standards and nature ofPresidential action under section 721. Section 800.601(a) reiterates thestatutory time frame and requirements for Presidential action. As providedin andSection; 800.601(c), Presidential action may include divestment withrespect to a concluded transaction, as well as other appropriate relief.Section 800.601(d) makes clear that all authority available to the Presidentunder section 721(c), including divestment authority, remains availableindefinitely, at the discretion of the President, for all acquisitionsconcluded after August 23, 1988, except for those which the Committee hasdecided not to investigate or with respect to which the President has determinednot to exercise his authority. This authority extends to transactions thathave not been the subject of a voluntary or agency notice. However, asprovided in paragraph (d), divestment remains available for non-notifiedtransactions only if the purpose for which divestment is sought is basedon circumstances existing at the time the transaction was concluded.The President's authority includes the ability to obtain divestment reliefbefore the completion of a Committee review or investigation where a proposedacquisition is or may be completed after notice has been given, but beforethe close of the 15-day period for Presidential action. This is in linewith guidance provided in the Conference Report, which recognizes thatacquisitions can be completed so quickly that the President needs a broadrange of remedies to respond appropriately to different circumstances,including attempts to circumvent the purposes of section 721. (See ConferenceReport at 927.)Paragraph (e) provides for Committee action in the event parties to anacquisition have submitted false or misleading information, or have omittedmaterial information. In such cases, the Committee can reopen the investigation,revise its recommendation to the President, and accept a new or resubmittedagency notification. Moreover, the President may take appropriate temporaryaction, and revise actions earlier taken.Subpart G: ConfidentialitySubpart G provides guidelines with respect to the provision and handlingof information.<T3>Section 800.701.</T3> This section makes clear that the parties toa notified transaction are obligated to provide the Committee with informationthat will enable it to conduct a full review and/or investigation of theproposed transaction. This section incorporates a reference to the DefenseProduction Act (50 U.S.C. App. 2155(a)) to highlight the authorities availableto the Committee for obtaining information.<T3>Section 800.702.</T3> Subsection 800.702(a) reiterates the comprehensiveconfidentiality provision in section 721(h). To highlight the importanceof maintaining the confidentiality of materials submitted under section721, paragraph (b) reiterates the penalty provision of the Defense ProductionAct for willful disclosures of information or documentary material providedunder these regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal author of this document is the Office of the Assistant GeneralCounsel (International Affairs).
