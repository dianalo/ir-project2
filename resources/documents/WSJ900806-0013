The study, a mix of praise and criticism formulated by theGATT secretariat, said the reforms will &quot;strengthen thecountry's links with the world economy and provide for tradepolicies and practices which are more firmly based on GATTrules and principles.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The report also said, &quot;The potential gains frominternational trade are particularly large for New Zealand.&quot;   At the same time, however, the study hinged its judgmenton the proviso that the reforms are &quot;consistently and fullycontinued and implemented.&quot;   The report said New Zealand's trade policies &quot;havegenerally become less distortive and more transparent overthe last 10 years.&quot;   And it continued, &quot;With the recent orientation oftrade-related policies, the country is already a moreattractive market for many trading partners through improvedmarket access and the prospects of accelerated medium-termgrowth in a more efficient New Zealand economy.&quot;   The report praised New Zealand's liberalization drive.&quot;The coverage of import licensing has been reduced, tariffshave been cut through a general tariff reduction program,most export incentive schemes and subsidies have beeneliminated, the role of the state in trade has been reduced,foreign-exchange restrictions have been removed, andfinancial controls and rules on foreign investments have beenrelaxed,&quot; the report said.
