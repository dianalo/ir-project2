 It's almost an oxymoron.andO;For the past few years the automated attendant has been portrayed as thehandmaiden to juicier voice-processing applications involving voice mail andaudiotex and interactive voice response.andM;Is this the limit of the automated attendant's usefulness?andP;  We didn't thinkso.andP;  With the help of several automated attendant manufacturers we uncoveredthree user stories that illustrate new ways to think about automatedattendants.andM;One company uses an automated attendant as the lynch pin of a marketingstrategy based on customer service.andP;  Another application adds a helpful newapplication to an already feature-rich PBX.andP;  And the third story demonstratesthat an automated attendant has more potential as a telecommunications accesstool than we usually give it credit for.andM;Guaranteed ServiceandM;Wouldn't it be great if you could promise your customers that their phonecalls to you would be answered on the first ring?andP;  Wouldn't it be even betterif you could keep that promise?andM;Miami Voice tells us a major office supply company in the northeastguarantees their customers that their calls will be answered on the firstring.andP;  A Miami Voice MV1600 automated attendant lets them keep that promise.andM;The interesting thing here is not the application exactly -- using anautomated attendant to answer calls quickly, even on the first ring, isnothing new.andP;  The interesting thing is the customer service angle thiscompany is taking.andM;By promoting the fact that their calls are answered on the first ring, thecompany is demonstrating their commitment to customer service.andP;  The automatedattendant, which has many benefits to the company that uses it, now becomes apositive in the eyes of the caller as well.andP;  A neat angle.andM;Enhance PBX FeaturesandM;Diversified Tenant Services uses a Mitel Generic 1000 PBX to act as a&quot;central office&quot; for one of the apartment complexes they own.andP;  The systemuses DID lines for incoming calls while outgoing calls are optimized withleast cost routing.andM;It's a pretty good deal for the tenants.andP;  When they sign their lease theyimmediately get a telephone number and their service can start as soon asthey plug in their phone.andP;  They get all kinds of special features like speedcalling, call forwarding, conference calling and call waiting, all at noextra cost.andM;The only problem the management company had was the Mitel switch could notprovide call waiting on a DID line.andP;  By using a Dacon Dart automatedatendant, they solved the problem.andM;By using the &quot;call forward busy&quot; feature of the PBX, calls to busy stationsare transferred to the Dart.andP;  The Dart gives callers a message telling themthat the line is busy and gives them the choice of holding or hanging up.andM;In order to hold the line the caller dials in the last four digits of thenumber they called.andP;  Because the call is coming from an internal station (theDart), the phone system handles the call by &quot;camping&quot; the caller on the line.andM;Once the caller &quot;camps on,&quot; the called party can use hookflash to switch backand forth between the waiting and the current call.andM;If you think of an automated attendant as an interface between your callersand your company and phone system, as Dacon and Diversified Tenant Servicesdid in this case, there's no end to the applications you can dream up.andM;AccessandM;The city of San Diego had a little problem.andP;  How could they provide publicaccess to city council meetings?andP;  One solution was piping sound into alistening room outside the city council chambers.andP;  The problem here was thatpeople with a big interest in the city council, like city employees andgovernment lobbyists, were spending an awful lot of time in that room.andM;A phone line seemed like a good idea, but government services policy statesthat the line could not be busy when a citizen called and staffing the linewith a city clerk would be expensive.andM;The solution was a Cobotyx Cobot automated attendant, actually four of themset up in a hunt group.andP;  Callers are given their choice of listening to alive broadcast of the city council meeting, speaking to a docket clerk or tocity clerk information.andM;A listening bridge allows 24 callers to listen to a one-way broadcast of thecouncil session in progress and the other menu options give them access toother pertinent information.andM;The moral of this applications story is that automated attendants provideaccess.andP;  What they access to is up to you.andP;  Many companies use an automatedattendant to provide access to a fax machine, an audiotex service or aninteractive voice response system.andP;  More unusual applications, like thelistening bridge in this example, are possible with a little imagination andcreativity.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
