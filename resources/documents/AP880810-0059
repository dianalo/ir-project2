Other thunderstorms hit Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois andColorado, where flooding was reported.   An Alabama teen-ager remained missing as Beryl was downgraded toa tropical depression Tuesday. The Coast Guard suspended a searchfor the 15-year-boy, who fell overboard Monday when a fishing boatcapsized in the Gulf of Mexico.   The Coast Guard also rescued six people who endured two days ofwind and rain on an island 10 miles off the Mississippi coast afterhigh seas prevented them from returning to the mainland.   ``I think we missed the forecast,'' said Randy Gibson ofGilbertown, Ala., captain of the 17-foot boat.   ``It's just a miracle that we survived,'' said his wife, Denvia.``God took care of us and brought us home.''   The storm had little impact on New Orleans or south Louisiana,which was preparing to host next week's Republican NationalConvention.   ``The beneficial aspects of this tropical storm are probablymuch greater than any negative effects from this system _ andthat's rain,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National HurricaneCenter in Coral Gables, Fla.   In Colorado Springs, Colo., a storm Tuesday dumped more than 3inches of rain and golf-ball size hail, turning streets intorivers. Numerous motorists had to be rescued from floating cars.   Firefighters were dispatched to homes and businesses whererising water poured under doors and through electrical walloutlets. Lightning knocked out power to 2,400 customers, and anelectric transformer exploded during the storm.   Beryl drifted toward the west-northwest at about 5 miles an hourearly today, leaving behind higher than usual tides and somethunderstorms. But hundreds who evacuated their coastal Mississippihomes on Monday began returning Tuesday when the weakened stormmoved inland.   The National Weather Service placed the storm's center nearLafayette, La., early today. The storm, with maximum winds of 35mph, was expected to take a more northwesterly direction latertoday.   ``We think it's going to ... turn toward the northwest up overthe Midwest area,'' said Sheets. ``We don't think it's going to goback out over the water so there's not much chance of it everstrengthening again.''   However, flood warnings remained along the Mississippi coastbecause of the threat of heavy rains overnight.   Damage was confined mostly to lowland flooding, scattered treelimbs and power outages that have since been restored.   The Alabama youth, whose name was not given, was reportedmissing Tuesday by a survivor found clinging to the hull of avessel that capsized Monday in the Mississippi Sound. Searchersbelieve the boat was swamped by 7-foot waves.   Thousands of workers who had been flown in from offshore oilrigs on Monday also began returning Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
