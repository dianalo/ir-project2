It has been claimedthat this result shows that these other theories are equivalent to thestandard Einstein theory with additional fields. However, it is pointedout that the coupling to matter defines what the physically measuredmetric will be, so that the freedom of identification of an arbitrarilydefined 2-tensor field as the metric is not justified. Simply, geodesicsprovide an operational definition of the metric.</TEXT></DOC>
