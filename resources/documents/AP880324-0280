But a week after he announced his candidacy, the Miami Heraldpublished a story saying a team of its reporters had observed Hartspending part of a weekend at his Washington townhouse with Miamimodel Donna Rice. Then it was learned that Hart and the women hadtraveled to Bimini together on the yacht, Monkey Business.   The publicity was devastating and a week after he entered therace, Hart withdrew with a bitter denunciation of the news media.   Hart's abrupt departure scrambled the Democratic field. But oneof those given the best chance of capitalizing on the new dynamicwas Biden, the youthful chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committeeand one of the party's best stump speakers.   But four months later, Biden was forced out after disclosurethat he had lifted campaign speech material from British politicianNeil Kinnock, delivering a personal anecdote as if it were his own.   Dukakis caught some fallout from the Biden incident when it waslearned that two of his top advisers were involved in leakingmaterial that pointed out the link between the Biden and Kinnockspeeches.   As Gephardt began looking like the Iowa front-runner, his rivalszeroed in on the congressman's populist message.   ``Where I come from, Dick Gephardt is the establishment,'' saidBabbitt.   ``I'm leery of election-year conversions,'' said Simon.   Gephardt ran television ads that attacked Dukakis as ``one ofthe biggest tax raisers in Massachusetts history.''   Simon ran ads attacking Gephardt for changing his positions onissues.   But Gephardt appeared to have the strongest message _ a toughattack on America's trading partners, those nations running hugetrade surpluses that could be traced to unfair practices.   ``Because of trade barriers, a $10,000 Chrysler K-Car costs$48,000 in Korea,'' said a Gephardt ad, ignoring the fact that theChrysler cars were not sold in Korea.   Gephardt said that if the Korean didn't change their ways they'dbe left ``asking themselves how many Americans are going to pay$48,000 for one of their Hyundais.''   Iowa weighed in and the winners were Dole and Gephardt. Bushfinished a poor third behind Robertson.   Next stop was New Hampshire.   It was Dukakis' backyard and he won easily, with Gephardt edgingSimon for second place.   On the Republican side, Dole entered New Hampshire on a roll. Hesteadily eroded Bush's big lead in the state and it looked like theKansan would make it two in a row and probably knock Bush out ofthe race.   No one was sure what happened next.   On the last weekend before the primary, Bush ran ads accusingDole of straddling on such issues as taxes and arms control. TheDole campaign never responded.   Bush won the primary by nine points. Dole, interviewed ontelevision, was asked if he had anything to say to Bush.   ``Tell him to stop lying about my record,'' snapped the senator.   Robertson finished last in New Hampshire, but looked ahead withrelish to the next big round, Super Tuesday in the South, theregion where he had his greatest following.   Two other candidates made an impression in the early contests.   Jackson showed a far greater ability to attract white votes thanhe had during his first run for the presidency four years earlier.   And Gore was conspicuous by his absence. He gambled everythingon his native South, planning to become the first beneficiary ofSuper Tuesday.   Dole bounced back to win South Dakota and Minnesota. But theSouth lay ahead and the Kansan had nothing going for him in theregion.   South Carolina Republicans held a primary the Saturday beforeSuper Tuesday. Robertson thought the state was tailor-made for hisBible Belt appeal. Dole got the endorsement of Sen. Strom Thurmond,and decided it would be a good state to challenge Bush.   Both proved very wrong. Atwater, a South Carolina native, hadorganized well for Bush and the vice president swept the state, ina preview of Super Tuesday when he won 16 of 16 primaries. Dole wassecond in most, Robertson third.   Super Tuesday effectively ended the Republican race. A weeklater, Bush swamped Dole in Illinois and the only question was whenthe senator would bow out.   On the Democratic side, it settled nothing.   Dukakis, Jackson and Gore split the spoils, Gephardt was the bigloser.   Simon didn't compete, but then won strongly in his home state ofIllinois which permitted him to go on for at least one more state _Wisconsin on April 5.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for AMs Sunday, March 27</NOTE></DOC>
