These projects are intended to reduceadministrative costs and error rates through a streamlining of proceduresused to determine household eligibility and benefit levels. A Work PlanGuide is available from FNS to assist in preparation of Work Plan submissions.Legislation limits operation to a maximum of ten projects, distributedamong five States and five political subdivisions; selection will be competitive.Final rulemaking to implement the authorizing legislation (Pub. L. 99-198,December 23, 1985) is being published simultaneously with this notice andcan be found elsewhere in this <T4>Federal Register</T4> under 7 CFR 272.1, 272.2 and 273.23. Proposedrulemaking was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 23, 1987, at 52 FR 13450.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Work Plans must be postmarked November 9, 1988 or earlierfor States and December 9, 1988 or earlier for local areas/political subdivisions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Work Plans should be submitted to Director, Program DevelopmentDivision, Family Nutrition Programs, Food and Nutrition Service, USDA,3101 Park Center Drive, Alexandria, Virginia 22302.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Questions regarding this noticeshould be directed to Russ Gardiner, Supervisor, Research and DemonstrationProjects Section, Administration and Design Branch, Program DevelopmentDivision, Family Nutrition Programs, at the above address, or by telephoneat (703) 756-3387.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG><T3>Executive Order 12291. </T3>This notice has been reviewed under ExecutiveOrder 12291 and Secretary's Memorandum 1512-1, and has been classifiednot major because the provisions will not result in: 1) An annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more; 2) a major increase in costs orprices for consumers, industries, Federal, State or local governments,or geographical regions; or 3) significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability ofUnited States-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.<T3>Executive Order 12372. </T3>The Food Stamp Program is listed in theCatalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551. For reasons setforth in the final rule and related notice to 7 CFR 3015, Subpart V (48FR 29115), this program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.<T3>Regulatory Flexibility Act. </T3>This notice also has been reviewedin relation to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980(Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, September 19, 1980). Anna Kondratas, Administratorof the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), has certified that this actionwill not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.<T3>Reporting and Recordkeeping. </T3>This notice does not contain reportingor recordkeeping requirements subject to approval by the Office of Managementand Budget. The reporting and recordkeeping requirements contained in theregulations which come under the provisions of the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507) will be submitted to OMB for their reviewand approval. Such reporting requirements will not be put into effect untilOMB approval is received.<T3>Background. </T3>Legislative requirements governing the Food StampProgram have led to the development of a complex set of regulations governingeligibility and benefit determinations. Eligibility and benefit determinationsare based on a wide variety of household circumstances including income,assets, and work status. Although these regulations provide extensive guidelinesfor eligibility staff, they also create a lengthy eligibility determinationprocess that is expensive to perform and is often subject to error. The Food Stamp and Commodity Distribution Amendments of 1981 (Pub. L. 97-98)authorized the Simplified Application Demonstration Project. The SimplifiedApplication Demonstration was an attempt to reduce the administrative burdenof food stamp benefit calculations by simplifying program rules while stillmaintaining the efficient ``targeting'' of benefits to households whichneed them the most. The demonstration tested how different approaches tostandardizing and simplifying policy affect benefits, administrative costs,and errors in the Food Stamp Program. The States of Oklahoma and Illinois,and San Diego and Fresno Counties, California participated in the demonstration.Results were sufficiently positive for Congress to authorize follow-upprojects in a limited number of locations.Section 1520 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-198) added anew section 8(c) to the Food Stamp Act (7 U.S.C. 2017(e)) which authorizedthe operation of Simplified Application/Standardized Benefit (SA/SB) Projects.As with the demonstration, these projects are intended to reduce administrativecosts through a streamlining of procedures used to determine householdeligibility and benefits. There are no time limitations on their operation.The legislation permits the use of SA/SB procedures as an alternative toregular Food Stamp Program (FSP) procedures, but limits operation of theseprojects to a maximum of five States and five political subdivisions. Giventhe potential outcomes of these projects, i.e., reduced administrativecosts and reduced error rates, FNS expects that many sites will want totake part in the project and that, as a result, a competitive selectionwill be necessary. To accomplish this selection, prospective project operatorswill be required to submit Work Plans containing detailed information onimplementation and operational procedures, and expected project outcomes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Notice of Intent</ITAG>This notice solicits Work Plans from States and local political subdivisionswishing to operate SA/SB Projects. The Work Plan Guide noted earlier presentsbasic information which will aid potential operators in preparing theirWork Plans. Its focus is on helping applicants respond to the evaluationcriteria, assisting particularly in simulating the effects of the SA/SBprocedures. FNS' selection of project sites will be based on the Work Plan'sresponsiveness to the published evaluation criteria. Accepted sites' WorkPlans will be included in the State Plan of Operations and will serve asthe basis for operation of the project.Selection of Project OperatorsThe legislation limits the operation of the project to a maximum of fiveStates and five political subdivisions. For the purposes of these projects,eligible applicants are Food Stamp Program ``State agencies'' and local``project areas'' as defined in program regulations at 7 CFR 271.2, whichreads, in part, as follows:``State agency'' means: (1) The agency of State government, including thelocal offices thereof, which is responsible for the administration of thefederally aided public assistance programs within the State, and in thoseStates where such assistance programs are operated on a decentralized basis,it includes the counterpart local agencies which administer such assistanceprograms for the State agency * * *``Project area'' means the county or similar political subdivision designatedby a State as the administrative unit for program operations * * *A State with a centralized, State-run food stamp system may, under certaincircumstances, make overlapping Work Plan submissions. For example, ifa State-run system is divided into administrative units which are themselvespolitical subdivisions, such as counties, then the State could file a separateWork Plan for the entire State as well as one for a specific administrativeunit/political subdivision.Application ProcessApplication is made by submitting a Work Plan which provides complete informationon how the State and/or political subdivision intends to implement andoperate the project. The Work Plan must be signed by the representativeof the State government with authority to commit the State or politicalsubdivision to project operations. This will generally be the person whosigns the State Plan of Operations. The Work Plans of successful applicantswill become amendments to the State Plan of Operations for their respectiveStates. If you would like to have notice that your Work Plan has been receivedby FNS, we ask you to mail the application ``Return Receipt Requested.''The Work Plans will be reviewed by FNS staff against the technical evaluationcriteria, and rated and ranked by the technical panel.Guidelines for the development and presentation of the information requestedin this notice are more fully presented in a published guide for preparingthe Work Plan. Due to the level of complexity, accuracy, and comparabilityrequired in the information, applicants are advised to read the Work PlanGuide carefully. The availability of the draft guide was announced in thePreamble of the proposed rulemaking published April 23, 1987. Persons whopreviously requested a copy of the draft guide or the final version ofthe guide have been placed on a mailing list and will be automaticallyreceiving a copy of the final guide. New requests for the guide can bemade to the office of Mr. Gardiner at the address and phone number givenearlier in this notice.Work Plans for Statwwide projects must be submitted in 10 copies to theFNS National Office no later than 120 days from publication of final regulations.Because local agency Work Plans will have to have the approval of theirgoverning State agencies, local applications will not be due until 150days from publication of final regulations.All offerors will be notified of the results of the selection process andnegotiations will be conducted as necessary.NotificationSelection is expected to occur on or before (210 days from date of publication)and it is planned that project operations will commence as quickly as possibleafter that date. Applicants will be notified when selected, or scheduledas a potential replacement site, or evaluated as not competitive for thepurposes of this project. While five States and five local political jurisdictionswill be selected to operate projects, a list of additional acceptable qualifiedsites will be established and replacement projects selected from this listin the event that any of the ten originally selected operators are unableeither to implement or continue operations.Duration and PerformanceThese projects are not demonstration projects, and do not have durationallimits except as established by law and regulation. At this time, thereare no prescribed durational limits to project site operations that areoperating in compliance with the law, regulations, the State Plan and theproject Work Plan. However, FNS reserves the right to terminate any projectat the convenience of the government. If this should occur, adequate advancenotice will be given to project operators to effect a smooth transitionto normal processing for project eligible households under routine benefitadministration procedures. Operators, of course, will have the right ofwithdrawal.FundingNo special fiscal incentives relative to administrative cost-sharing arebeing offered. Administrative cost-sharing for this project will conformto usual program rules.ReportingOngoing project reporting requirements will be limited to reporting onthe project's error rate impact. This data will be due to FNS on the annualquality control reporting schedule established at andSection; 275.21(d).EvaluationEach selected project site will be required to perform a self-evaluationshortly after project implementation. The evaluation will verify the projectedproject impacts provided in the Work Plan submission. Actual informationon the project's impact on administrative costs, benefits and participationwill be collected. This data will be due to FNS within six months of implementation.Actual error rate impacts will be separately reported due to the necessityof collecting this information over a long time period.Work Plan ContentsThe outline is to be followed in developing your proposed Work Plan. Theinformation requested below must be presented in as clear and completea manner as possible to assure maximum competitive status. It is particularlyimportant that all offerors present data on project effects in a mannerwhich will facilitate comparative analysis. The last part of this discussionsuggests how to analyze project effects and describes how to present theresults of that analysis.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Background</ITAG>1.

Administrative Cost Impacts.</T3><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note 1._</T4>For the Simplified Application Demonstration Project,estimates of case-processing time were based on staff interviews. However,other means of documenting current and changed costs are acceptable aslong as they are clearly explained and reasonable for the operating system.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note 2._</T4>FNS will be weighting each proposer's administrative costsavings by a factor which compares a State's current administrative case-monthcost to the National average.</ITAG>a. For each population of project eligible household, what is the currentaverage monthly case-processing cost on a per-case basis? What is the totalmonthly case processing cost for each population? For the total project-eligiblepopulation? b. How have you developed the cost estimates described in (a)?<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note._</T4>It is recognized that many different systems may be usedfor documenting case-processing costs and the expected effects of the projectin this area. Offerors are free to develop their estimates of case-processingcost effects in any way appropriate to their data systems. However, theseestimates should be fully documented and reproducible. They should providethe sources of the data; the time period from which they are drawn; assumptionswhich have been applied; and an explanation of computations in an easilyfollowed manner.</ITAG>c. Once the project is implemented, for each type of project-eligible household,what will be the average monthly case-processing cost on a per-case basis?The total monthly case-processing cost?d. How have you developed the cost estimate described in (c)? To show this,you need to provide separate tables which show the following: (1) Estimated average difference in the time required to process an AFDC/FoodStamp case due to the changes induced by the demonstration for intakes,recertifications, and interim changes. (2) Potential monthly cost savings from reduce staff time for intake, ongoingcase processing, and supervision. (3) Estimated change in staff time induced by the demonstration for intake,recertification, interim changes, and total ongoing case processing time.(4) Potential hours saved per month in case-processing time, for intakeand ongoing case-processing. (5) Potential monthly time savings by supervisory staff for intakes andongoing case processing. (6) Potential monthly cost saving from reduced staff time for case processingand supervision. e. What is the total projected annual savings in case-processing costsfor all proposed project populations? f. What percentage of total case-processing costs for the project populationsdoes this (e) represent? g. What were total FS administrative costs for FY 87? What percentage oftotal food stamp administrative costs do your projected case-processingcost savings (e) equate to?h. Are there any planned reallocations or shifts of resources associatedwith the project? (For example, will some time saving attributable to theproject be shifted to error reduction strategies, such as moving staffover to non-project food stamp caseloads, or computer matching, etc.?)Will positions be dropped?<T3>4. Effects on Measured Error (This information is needed for planningand evaluation purposes. A State or political subdivision's current QCerror rate and the effect of the project on that error rate will not bea selection factor.)</T3><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note.</T4>_The amount of error reduction which sites can expect toachieve is highly dependent upon the benefit methodology which has beenchosen. For every benefit component that has been standardized and as aresult eliminated as a potential source of error, the error attributableto that factor will likewise be eliminated. Indirect error rate effectscan also occur if time freed up through simplification is devoted to otheractivities designed to reduce error. By analyzing current error sourcesfrom the most recent annual IQCS sample, conclusions can be drawn aboutpotential error reduction. Site are not expected to make predictions onindirect error rate effects.</ITAG>a. As categorized by the Integrated Quality Control System (IQCS) or otheravailable data sources, what errors exist for project eligible householdsand what is the dollar value of such errors? b. Based on new project procedures, what change is expected in the overalldollar error rate and in errors by source for project-eligible households?(Discuss both payment error and underissuance in a format which breaksout error by source including, at least, earned income, unearned income,household composition, shelter deduction, application of demonstrationpolicies, and other.) c. What assumptions apply to the estimated changes in error sources? <T3>5. Impacts on Food Stamp Benefits.</T3><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note.</T4>_Once sites have developed a benefit methodology, they musttest its effects on the existing caseload to satisfy this portion of theWork Plan. How this test is completed will depend on the benefit methodologychosen, the current level of program automation, and the amount of datawhich is contained in the master file. Some sites may be able to directlysimulate effects for all households. Others may have to select a statisticallyvalid sample of households and use hard copy casefile information. ThisWork Plan must describe in detail how the simulation was done and what,if any, limitations exist on the data presented. The more serious the caveats,the less confidence we will have in the presented effects. Congress requiresthat average benefits for each category of household must not be less thanthe average would have been under the conventional Food Stamp Program.It is also essential to minimize monthly losses experienced by individualhouseholds. As a guide, offerors should keep monthly losses to no morethan $10 per household or 20 percent of the original benefit, whicheveris less. </ITAG>a. What is the current average monthly benefit issued to each type of project-eligiblehousehold? What are the total monthly food stamp benefits issued to eachtype of project-eligible household? What is the sum of monthly benefitsissued to all project-eligible households? b. Describe how project participants are distributed based upon the followingcharacteristics: Net food stamp income, food stamp benefit amount, earnedincome, gross income by poverty level, shelter deduction, dependent carecost, presence of elderly/disabled, receipt of recoupment and whether householdis a regular AFDC case or an AFDC-UP. c. How will current benefits change as result of the project? Develop tablesfor all project-eligible households which show, by household size and incrementsof $5, monthly benefit changes in dollars and percentages. Then, usinga similar table, show what pattern of household gains and losses is expectedfor each project-eligible population and for each sub-category of households,as applicable, within project populations. (Prior experience has shownthat households experiencing significant gains and losses (outlyers) aremost probably incorrectly certified.)d. What will be the average change in benefits, if any, among all projecthouseholds, and among these households according to their proverty status,i.e., gross food stamp income as a percentage of the current poverty standard,Show the distribution of expected monthly benefit gains and losses forall project-eligible households and for each category of project-eligiblehousehold. Include mean dollar changes in benefits, number of households,and percent of households. <ITAG tagnum="84">Selection Criteria </ITAG>1.
