Look at the pressreleases from back then and you'll see the same wild aspirations and the samefawning punditry intoned by experts and analysts who should know better.andM;Yes, Windows 3.0 is the best thing to come to Windows since its introduction,five years ago.andP;  But there's one major problem: It's still Windows.andP;  Thistime, they've gussied it up a bit so it looks presentable.andP;  But why should itbe any more successful now than in the past?andM;Let me simplify the reasons why Windows will be little more than a short-termcuriosity.andM;First, it's a DOS shell.andP;  Period.andP;  This means that it will sap performance bycreating a roadblock between the user, the program, and the operating system.andO;This is no good.andM;The key to the difference between the Macintosh and PC worlds is that PCusers are performance-oriented while Mac users are ease-of-use-oriented.andP;  Thegraphical user interface has nothing to do with either camp.andP;  It happens thatthe Mac has a GUI and the PC doesn't.andP;  Putting a GUI on the PC won't changethe needs of the user.andP;  Remember, the term power user was invented by PCowners.andP;  Windows blocks these two worlds from joining up.andP;  First, it sapsperformance.andP;  Second, it does not provide the ease of use that the Macoperating system provides.andP;  When you install hardware or special softwareinto the Mac environment, you don't run complex install programs.andP;  You don'tfuss with AUTOEXEC and CONFIG files.andP;  You simply slide an icon into thesystem folder.andP;  Bingo, the product is installed.andP;  Does Windows do this? No.andM;So what's the point of it? Multitasking? Amiga has had true multitasking foryears, and I don't see people flocking to that machine.andP;  Interestinglyenough, the newest Windows iteration feels and looks much like the Amiga GUIoperating system.andM;I think Windows 3.0 will get a lot of attention; people will cheek it out,and before long they'll all drift back to raw DOS.andP;  Once in a while they'llboot Windows for some specific purpose, but many will put it in the closetwith the Commodore 64.andM;It's a fact that a PC user confronted with a WIMP (windows, icons, mouse,pointers) interface on a PC finds it uncomfortable.andP;  When I'm using a PC inDOS, it feels right when I type in a command and the machine takes action.andO;This will always feel right.andM;It's true that, with enough performance increases, Windows approaches thefeel of the Mac.andP;  On a 486, for example.andP;  But the argument goes that a PCrunning Windows is the cost-effective alternative to the Mac.andP;  There are noMac clones to compete with.andP;  Therefore, users will choose the PC runningWindows.andP;  But it really takes an expensive, high-speed PC to make Windowsfeel right.andP;  So where's the savings? Might as well buy a Mac if this is whatyou want from life.andM;WELL, NOW WE can finally deal with the reality of Windows 3.0, rather thanthe vague, infuriating razzle-dazzle of an unreleased product.andP;  I had hopedreality would calm your raving Windows-phobia, John, since 3.0 is one of theepochal products in the history of the PC business.andM;Sure, earlier releases of Windows were dogs.andP;  They were achingly slow, theywere memory pigs, and so on.andP;  Few of us used Windows except when we hadto-which meant with Windows-only applications such as PageMaker and Excel.andO;We used Windows because we wanted to take advantage of those superb programs.andM;Windows 3.0 is going to change that view-it has already begun to changepeople's minds in the couple of months since the product shipped-and beforelong that curmudgeonly sneer of yours is going to look pretty silly, as thebest and brightest new PC applications appear for Windows.andM;GUIs offer real human and dollars-and-cents benefits-when they're right.andO;Earlier versions of Windows failed that test and became toys, novelties notup to real work and thus not cc rewarding enough to justify the investment intime and hardware.andM;But Windows 3.0, while still far from perfect, has crossed the Line ofSufficiency.andP;  The good outweighs the bad; the payback exceeds the cost.andM;Microsoft achieved those gains at a cost to us, of course.andP;  No one shouldbelieve the fluff being put out that Windows 3.0 is perfectly OK on a 10MHzor faster 286 PC with 1MB of memory.andP;  At minimum, decent performance requiresa 386SX and 3 to 4MB.andP;  Otherwise, screen refreshes and moving betweenapplications take too long, and programs run too slowly.andP;  And, of course, youneed a mouse; navigating Windows applications without one will drive youinsane.andM;But if you'll look at the real world just this once, John, you'll find thatan awful lot of serious PC users already have that kind of system.andP;  Andthey've been waiting for a product like Windows to make that system fly.andM;Windows 3.0 is going to be a flash in the pan? John, didn't you say the samething about desktop publishing, CD-ROM, and every word processor since theearly WordStar releases? You weren't too sure about ATs or 386SXs, either, asI recall.andM;The Windows market will be usurped by DOS? Microsoft says that DOS 5.0 willbe a little smaller than DOS 3.x and 4.0, have primitive multitasking, anduse memory a little more intelligently.andP;  And it will have that same terribleDOS shell that appeared with 4.0.andP;  Excuse me, this is the product you thinkis going to usurp anything?andM;Worse, you act as if the Microsoft that builds Windows isn't the one thatbuilds DOS-as if neither side knows what the other is up to, as if Windowscan't or won't evolve beyond Version 3.0.andP;  Face it, John: Windows 3.0 is thestart of a new era in PCs.andP;  They're getting to be fun again.andP;  Except forgrinches like you.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
