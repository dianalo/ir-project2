Hyatt (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> COT MS </CO><IN> TNM ARO BON </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Colt Industries Inc. management and a Morgan Stanley Group Inc. affiliate proposed a $660 million buy-out of the aerospace, automotive and industrial products company.    Colt shares rose $4.875 a share in response to the $17-a-share offer, which has been approved by a special committee of outside directors. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Colt shares closed at $18.125, above the proposed offering price, on heavy volume of 3.4 million shares.    The buy-out offer comes less than two years after Colt undertook a novel $1.7 billion recapitalization plan under which the company sharply boosted its debt to pay shareholders $85 a share in cash, and placed more shares under control of the employee retirement plan. The result made the company much less attractive as a hostile takeover candidate.    David I. Margolis, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the latest proposal will provide &quot;the opportunity to establish and implement a more aggressive business program, including acquisitions, than we could have undertaken alone.&quot;    The buying group has committed $200 million in equity to the purchase; the group includes Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II, a limited partnership created by Morgan Stanley Group that invests in leveraged buy-outs. The fund and Morgan Stanley Group have agreed to provide about $460 million in bridge financing for the purchase, to be repaid through a public or private offering of long-term debt.    In a leveraged buy-out a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    The offer is subject to waivers by bank lenders, tender of a majority of the shares, and &quot;no better offer being received and accepted.&quot;    The 1986 recapitalization resulted in about 35% of Colt's shares being held by the company's employee retirement plan. The shares took a beating in the market crash in October, when they traded as low as $7.50 a share.    Although the company boosted its debt by about $1 billion in the reorganization, some debt has since been retired, freeing additional borrowing capacity. In addition, officials say the company's cash flow and future prospects will support additional borrowing. At year end, Colt had about $1.4 billion in long-term debt outstanding.    In 1987, the company had net income of $75 million, including a $25.7 million gain on sale of a subsidiary, or $2.15 a share. Sales totaled $1.64 billion.    Colt's businesses include Colt Firearms, Fairbanks Morse engines, aerospace components such as landing gear, and automotive and industrial products.    Standard andamp; Poor's said it placed about $900 million of Colt debt on its CreditWatch list for a possible downgrade, saying the buy-out could further reduce the company's &quot;very thin cash flow protection.&quot; A more aggressive acquisition program could &quot;forestall meaningful debt reduction,&quot; Sandamp;P added. </TEXT></DOC>
