The stay will allow the Japanese Salmon Fisheries Cooperative Association to appeal the order, and in the meantime, the Japanese fleet will be allowed to fish off Alaska.    The stay, which runs through July 13, could make the issue moot for this year, as the fleet is likely to complete its fishing for this season in early July, according to Roger McManus, president of the Center for Environmental Education, which brought the suit.    U.S. District Judge Norma Johnson last week issued a preliminary injunction against a Commerce Department permit that allows the Japanese fleet to fish in U.S. waters between June 10 and July 31.    Judge Johnson ruled that the permit appears contrary to the Marine Mammals Protection Act, which bars the killing of seals, dolphins and other marine mammals. The mammals are trapped in salmon nets.    Judge Johnson also ordered the Center for Environmental Education to post a $1 bond; bond was set at $1,000 for a group of native Alaskan fishermen. Bond is required to provide for damages to the fishermen, in case the courts eventually decide that the permit is legal. The Japanese fleet is already committed to spending more than $40 million on salaries, gear and fuel, an attorney for the fishermen said. </TEXT></DOC>
