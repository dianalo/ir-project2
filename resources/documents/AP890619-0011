The country's 39 million households each held an average 19.1million yen, equivalent to about $132,450, in personal savings lastyear, according to a recent Bank of Japan report.   Total personal savings rose 11.4 percent to $5.18 trillion in1988 and accounted for more than half the total value of Japan'sgoods and services, outpacing growth in consumer spending, whichsurged 4.5 percent.   It was the third year that personal savings deposited at banksand postal offices or held in stocks, bonds and insurance posteddouble-digit growth over the previous year.   It also is a clear indication that the Japanese have notabandoned their habit of saving a substantial part of their incomes.   Japanese save 16 percent of their income on average, compared toabout 5.5 percent in the United States.   The bulk of personal savings in Japan _ $4.45 trillion _ is heldin bank and postal deposits and in bonds and insurance, theremainder in stocks.   However, savings figures exclude important assets such as realestate and therefore understate the wealth of many Japanese families.   Homeowners in Tokyo, for example, held real estate worth anaverage of $596,393 in 1987, according to the government's EconomicPlanning Agency.   Likewise, the lower savings rate in the United States understatesthe wealth of American families, which is mainly held in housing,says Richard C. Koo, senior economist at Nomura Research Institute.   Japanese savings mainly are in financial assets, he says. Thatcreates a massive pool of capital for Japanese industry.   ``While the value of land in Japan tends to appreciate, housingactually depreciates. People know that their houses will not beworth much 10 years from now, so they don't invest in housing,'' Koosaid.   ``Americans put their savings into keeping their homes up,because they expect them to appreciate,'' he explained.   Housing in Japan is vulnerable to earthquakes and fires andtraditionally is torn down and rebuilt rather than maintained.   Numerous surveys say the Japanese save to prepare for illness anddisaster, for retirement and childrens' educations.   ``I've always stashed whatever I could in the bank, so I'd have anice nest egg,'' said Seitarou Komatsu, 41, an employee of a majorJapanese industrial firm. ``It's my security. That way, I can relaxand not worry.''   The prospect of long years of retirement is a crucial reason.Average life expectancy in Japan is 82.1 years for women and 75.9years for men, while the mandatory retirement age at many companiesis 55-60.   ``The Japanese are much less confident about the future thanAmericans,'' said Koo. ``They know how much things cost here, andthey're wise to prepare for their old age.''   But, how do they do it?   The expansion of two-income families has contributed to thegrowth in personal savings, along with rising values of financialassets.   The average monthly wage for a Japanese worker in a company with30 employees or more _ about half of Japan's work force of 44million _ is about $2,329, while spending averages $2,080 ahousehold.</TEXT></DOC>
