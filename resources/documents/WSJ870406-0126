The new products -- eight versions of three basic models, priced from $1,695 to $10,995 -- represent a risky bid by IBM to revive sales of its personal computers and, in particular, to protect its traditional and most cherished market: large corporations. The more expensive new products aimed at business customers offer improved hookups to IBM's other computers and include features that the company hopes will make them resistant to copying by so-called clone manufacturers.    Even if the strategy works -- and that is far from a sure bet -- it won't help soon. Only four new machines are available now; the family's most powerful computer won't come out until late this year. The internal software from Microsoft Corp. that taps the new gear's power won't be available until early 1988. Moreover, a special IBM-designed version of the software, aimed at giving the new computers features the clones can't easily copy, may take substantially longer. So, it isn't clear the products will do much to thwart clone makers, particularly in the short run.    Many customers and consultants were impressed with the technology in the new IBM machines. They are the first to use new chips that hold more than a million characters of data, and they include advanced visual features or graphics. Corporate customers welcomed the eventual promise of fast and seamless links to bigger IBM computers.    But few customers seemed ready to buy big now. Software makers, meanwhile, were relieved by assurances that IBM's new products won't require entire rewrites of programs and that one version may be able to serve the new machines and rival brands. The stock market saw the IBM delays as good news for almost all rivals. In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, IBM's stock tumbled $3.125 a share, to $148, while shares of competitors such as Tandy Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. rose.    In any event, the new products seem likely to trigger a troublesome period of widespread confusion in the industry and among customers. There are also likely to be sharp price cuts on old products. And software makers will be scrambling to write new programs and decide where to place their bets.    Consumer pocketbooks may be the first to benefit. IBM said yesterday that it is cutting prices by as much as 35% on some older models, and rivals will be forced to follow if they want to continue their strategy of undercutting IBM on price. Big business customers seem likely to freeze purchases of personal computers for months, waiting to analyze IBM's new products and wondering how rivals will respond.    IBM is expected to spend $30 million advertising the new products in the next three months. The barrage began with a full-page newspaper ad yesterday that carried no company name and ended with a single line: &quot;Here we go again.&quot; The first television ad ran on the nightly news last night, and in a few weeks IBM will place a 24-page ad supplement on the new PCs.    The ad assault may be premature. Dealers said they don't expect big-volume orders of the new IBM machines before the third quarter this year. Customers will buy only a few to test them now, then &quot;somewhere around June there will be a lot of decisions made,&quot; said Alan Hald, chairman of MicroAge Computer Stores Inc.    But IBM needs help quickly. Some analysts said they believe its net income in the first quarter will fall as much as 40% to the lowest level in nine years. PCs provide perhaps 15% of IBM's total business, and IBM's 27% profit plunge in 1986 stemmed partly from the loss of market share to clones. Market researcher InfoCorp figured IBM's share of the IBM-compatible market, as high as 63% in 1984, fell sharply to 38% of a $17.7 billion-plus market last year.    Moreover, even if IBM's new family eventually goes a long way toward shielding profitable corporate accounts, some analysts said it almost gives up on the $1,000-range market and doesn't appeal much to small businesses and individuals who don't need the fanciest new features. &quot;It's the gutsiest move IBM has ever made,&quot; says Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies. &quot;It seals the Fortune 500, but it almost isolates IBM from the rest of the world.&quot;    Indeed, IBM's new line, known as the Personal System/2, will take a long time to seal off anything. IBM wouldn't even say yet when it can deliver the most important, anti-clone feature of the new line: the first IBM-proprietary version of Microsoft's internal software system.    This so-called operating-system &quot;extension&quot; aims to give IBM PCs unique and &quot;clean&quot; links to bigger IBM computers -- hookups the clones won't easily match, many analysts believe. But IBM will wait until the fourth quarter before even announcing a delivery schedule for such a system, which presumably won't be shipped until some time into 1988.    IBM officials countered that the new line isn't hurt by delays, that big customers need plenty of time to plan purchases anyway, and that IBM development labs did a fine job on a mammoth project. &quot;It's dynamite,&quot; contended Ed Lucente, head of U.S. marketing.    But IBM's competitors rushed to disagree, and the stock market sided against IBM. While IBM stock fell, archrival Compaq's shares rose $1.625, to $31.25. Tandy shares rose $1.25, to $49.25, and shares of Commodore International Ltd., which just introduced an IBM clone, rose $1.25, to $12.25. In over-the-counter trading, shares of clone-maker Wyse Technology Inc. also rose, and Apple Computer Inc. stock was up sharply.    &quot;After all the dust settles from the big announcement, the long wait begins,&quot; said Apple Chairman John Sculley, contending that Apple is way ahead of IBM. Similarly, Compaq President Rod Canion said he doesn't see any need for price cuts or product changes and that IBM's new line &quot;doesn't offer any major new advantages and isn't very aggressive from a pricing standpoint.&quot;    But the competition may be a bit optimistic. &quot;Apple has a short memory,&quot; said Ron Posner, president of Ansa Software Corp. He points out that Apple made similar claims of superiority when IBM introduced its first PC in 1981. IBM's new products offer many of the visual features that are a strong point of Apple's Macintosh. The new line also includes IBM's first laser printer and desktop-publishing system, the main features that allowed Macintosh to make inroads into corporate accounts.    IBM's entrance into the desktop-publishing market is &quot;a kick to Apple's solar plexus&quot; and could restrict the company's sales to larger businesses, according to Robert J. Crowell, chairman and chief executive officer of Neeco Inc., a Canton, Mass.-based dealer. &quot;This will make the wall higher and make it harder for Apple to get in.&quot;    In addition, IBM's pricing strategy could hurt competitors. For example, the company plans big discounts on the new $1,695 machine for schools, a main Apple market. One of the new PCs offers almost double the memory and slightly more storage for 11% less than the competing Compaq machine. IBM PCs traditionally are priced higher than rival brands, which typically must undercut IBM prices by 15%.    But IBM's new top-of-the-line PC, which is based on Intel Corp.'s powerful 80386 microprocessor, is priced 25% higher than a similarly equipped Compaq. And Tandy Chairman John Roach figured his major market -- smaller businesses, home users and schools, or about five million potential customers -- won't be hurt by IBM's $1,695 PC since a similar Tandy sells at $1,000 or less.    One uncertainty: Improvements in manufacturing automation and techniques for mounting chips have cut production costs for IBM PCs by as much as 40% by some estimates, and the company may have room to cut prices further. IBM said yesterday it can assemble one of the new midrange PCs in less than one minute. The drop in production costs may be one reason why some rivals already are cutting prices; Epson America Inc. cut prices $100 to $400 before the IBM debut.    IBM officials seemed unconcerned about potential snags yesterday as the company staged its splashiest debut since entering the personal computer business in 1981. A presentation to dealers at the Miami Beach Convention Center was broadcast live to thousands of customers, IBM personnel and analysts at 90 sites across the U.S. Top IBM officials took the stage as taped singers chanted &quot;This is it&quot; and &quot;A brand new day.&quot; IBM ended the bash for dealers with a laser show and fireworks -- inside the building. However, IBM's advertising barrage for the new products won't feature Charlie Chaplin. IBM will sideline the familiar &quot;Little Tramp&quot; character in favor of new ads featuring cast members from the TV comedy &quot;M*A*S*H.&quot;    But in moving against such clones as Epson, IBM may be applying more immediate pressure through its new, tighter approach to PC dealers.    Big Blue is restricting the number of dealers -- now totaling 2,300 for the old line -- that will be authorized to sell the newest and highest-priced products by creating a special class of retailer. It will give dealers eight months to qualify for the new program, which requires salespeople to take five days of special IBM training at dealer expense; service technicians must endure an eight-day training session from IBM.    Moreover, the dealers must meet certain sales quotas, carry other designated IBM products, report sales to IBM monthly and bolster customer support. Such requirements may force some dealers to drop other brands to spend more time and resources on the IBM line. &quot;Anyone who carries four or five (brands) will have to reevaluate it,&quot; said Bert Helfinstein, chairman of Entre Computer Centers Inc. Added Jim Levinson, who owns three ComputerLand stores in Cincinnati: &quot;The kinds of things (IBM) is asking for are very money-intensive . . . it's going to make us rethink our business totally.&quot;    The low end of the IBM line consists of two models that IBM said are as much as 2 1/2 times faster than the existing PC XT, have more memory and have better graphics, and are lower priced. One sells at $1,695; the other costs $600 more for a &quot;hard&quot; disk storing 10,000 pages of data. The new gear also includes a $3,595 desktop model and two &quot;under-the-desk&quot; floor models (priced at $5,295 and $6,295), all of which are based on the Intel 80286 chip used in the old PC AT.    Its new top-of-the-line products consist of three floor models based on the powerful Intel 80386 chip. Priced at $6,995, $8,495 and $10,995 depending on features, all have more memory and better graphics. IBM said the 286 and 386 products are two to 3 1/2 times faster than the existing PC AT.    The four lowest-priced models are available immediately, but one 286 machine won't be in stores until later this quarter; two 386 models won't be shipped until July and the most powerful 386 machine won't be delivered until the fourth quarter.    IBM also announced dozens of other hardware and software products including five printers, computer-networking programs, and a desktop-publishing system priced at $8,553, which some analysts saw as aggressively priced.    To clear store shelves for the new products, IBM made these price reductions: a 35% cut to $1,395 for a model of the PC XT and a 32% cut to $1,545 for another; a 15% cut to $1,695 for the PC Convertible &quot;laptop&quot;; a 17% cut to $2,810 for another XT model; a 13% cut to $4,595 for two PC AT versions; 9.3% cuts to $6,810 for two other ATs, and cuts of 4% to 10% for four models of IBM's slow-selling 3270 PC line.    ---                 The Evolution of the IBM PC 1 -- Original IBM Personal Computer    Debut: August 12, 1981    Price: $2235    Features: Intel 8088 mircoprocessor, 48 kilobytes ofmemory, 160-kilobyte floppy disk drive 2 -- IBM Personal Computer XT    Debut: March 8, 1983    Price: $4995    Features: Intel 8088 microprocessor, 128k memory, 360kfloppy disk drive, 10 megabyte hard disk 3 -- IBM Personal Computer AT    Debut: August 14, 1984    Price: $5795    Features: Intel 80286 microprocessor, 512k memory, 1.2megabyte floppy disk drive, 20 megabyte hard disk IBM Personal System/2 4 -- Model 30*    Debut: April 1987    Price: $1695    Features: Intel 8086 microprocessor, 640k memory, two720k floppy disk drives 5 -- Model 50*    Debut: April 1987    Price: $3595    Features: Intel 80286 microprocessor, 1 megabyte memory,1.44 megabyte floppy disk drive, 20 megabyte hard disk 6 -- Model 80*    Debut: July 1987    Price: $6995    Features: Intel 80386 microprocessor, 1 megabyte memory,1.44 megabyte floppy disk drive, 44 megabyte hard disk Note: 1 megabyte, or 1000 kilobytes, equals 500 typewrittenpages of text *Data shown is for the most basic configuration   ---               IBM's Personal Computer Ventures   While International Business Machines Corp. has enjoyedsuccess since entering the personal computer business in1981, it also has had its share of problems. Here's achronology:   Aug. 1981 -- The IBM PC is introduced, aimed as ahobbyists' box. Stunned by huge orders from businesses, IBMcan't meet the demand. While the PC is ultimately a hugesuccess, clone makers already have their first break.   March 1983 -- The hard-disk PC XT is unveiled; orders farexceed supply for more than a year. Compaq Computer Corp.'shard-disk portable, out only seven months later, stealssales.   Oct. 1983 -- IBM introduces the 3270 PC and PC XT-370,pricey machines aimed at big companies needing tie-ins tomainframes. Sales are dismal. (IBM is expected to scrap themodels.)   Nov. 1983 -- The PCjr makes its debut after a year ofbuildup. But it isn't shipped until after the crucialChristmas buying period because of a glitch: Paint peels offthe casing. The model's limited memory, high price andbeginner's keyboard are harshly criticized. This time IBMmakes far too many machines and the problems get fixed toolate. IBM has more than 200,000 unsold machines when it killsJunior in March 1985.   Feb. 1984 -- Alarmed by the success of Compaq's portablecomputer, IBM unveils a bulky portable. Analysts criticizeits high price and limited features and dub it&quot;Compaq-compatible.&quot; Compaq's model outsells it 7 to 1. InApril 1986 IBM quietly kills the model, selling units toemployees at fire-sale prices.   Aug. 1984 -- The PC AT debuts with Topview, software thatlets several other programs run at once. The AT is flawed bybugs in the hard disk. IBM first denies the problem, thenfixes it. The short supply opens the way for clones, whichsoon grab half the market. Despite IBM touting Topview's&quot;strategic&quot; importance, almost no one writes new software towork with it. (IBM all but abandoned Topview yesterday,adopting most aspects of Microsoft Corp.'s rival Windowsprogram.   Jan. 1986 -- The RT PC, based on unique IBM technology,comes out aimed at engineers. The market yawns. Softwaredevelopers barely respond. IBM later upgrades the model butsales remain unimpressive.   April 1986 -- The PC Convertible, a 12-pound &quot;laptop,&quot; isintroduced to much hoopla and great expectation. But itsscreen is criticized as murky, and its phone-line modem isn'tready; without it, the machine can't send data back to theoffice. IBM takes months to fix the snags. Market forecastershalve enthusiastic sales projections.   Aug. 1986 -- IBM unveils the XT 286, which lashes togetherthe old XT design with the AT's more-powerful chip. Manycorporate customers avoid it, saying it is a mere stopgap boxto keep out clones. One embarrassing glitch: Circuit cardsdesigned for the bigger AT are too tall to fit in the XT 286;they can't be used unless the lid to the new product's casingis permanently removed.</TEXT></DOC>
