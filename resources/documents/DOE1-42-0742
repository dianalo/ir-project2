Unlike other SPDS implementation tests which determineif hardware and software perform in accordance with specific functionalrequirements, the Man-in-the-Loop Validation test provides a mechanismfor assessing whether the SPDS meets its primary design goal. In accordancewith NUREG-0737, Supplement 1, this goal is to aid the control room operatingcrew in monitoring the status of Critical Safety Functions (CSFs). Inorder to make this assessment, the Millstone Unit 3 Man-in-the-Loop Validationevaluated the SPDS as part of the integrated plant operating system.This integrated system included trained operators, emergency procedures,and plant instrumentation. This paper summarizes the goals, preparation,execution, and evaluation of the Millstone Unit 3 SPDS Man-in-the-LoopValidation test program.</TEXT></DOC>
