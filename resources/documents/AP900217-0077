As the prosecution ended its second week of evidence andprepared to wrap up its case, a picture emerged of a cohesivenavigational team strengthened by highly educated and experiencedofficers but weakened by the troubled few.   As the case against Hazelwood unwound, questions were raisedabout the skipper's drinking, his knowledge of the crew and hisjudgment in leaving the ship's bridge in the hands of others at thetime of a tricky maneuver.   Did he know that the man holding the ship's wheel, Robert Kagan,had well-known problems with steering? Did he rely too much on theveteran third mate, Gregory Cousins? And, once the ship wasgrounded, did Hazelwood try a dangerous maneuver to rock it off ajagged reef?   The jury must decide whether any of Hazelwood's actionsconstituted the reckless behavior with which he is charged.   The 43-year-old Hazelwood, the only person criminally prosecutedin the nation's worst oil spill, is charged with second-degreecriminal mischief, a felony, and three misdemeanors _ recklessendangerment, negligent discharge of oil and operating a vesselwhile intoxicated.   If convicted on all charges, Hazelwood faces a maximum penaltyof 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines.   The March 23, 1989, grounding of the 987-foot Exxon Valdezspilled 10.92 million gallons of oil into the clear waters ofPrince William Sound, killing countless birds, fish and wildlifeand coating hundreds of miles of rocky coast with black goo.   As crew members formed a virtual parade to the witness stand,their struggle to maintain loyalty to the captain while testifyingagainst him was evident.   Cousins, who was in charge of the ship when it ran aground,blamed the helmsman, Kagan, for failing to follow orders and steerhard to the right. ``I think Mr. Kagan didn't really understand thecommand,'' said Cousins.   The third mate credited Hazelwood with being calm and clearly incommand after the disaster.   Kagan himself conceded under oath that he had become ``timid''about steering after he was once accused of ``chasing thecompass,'' or oversteering a ship.   James Kunkel, the chief mate, graduate of prestigious KingsPoint Merchant Marine Academy and a 20-year veteran of the seas,suggested the skipper knew _ or should have known _ that helmsmanKagan was the weak link in the ship's chain of operations.   ``I mentioned I'd sailed with him before and I thought he neededextra supervision and extra practice in steering,'' Kunkel said,recalling a conversation he had with Hazelwood. He said Kagan couldnot do even the simplest tasks without being watched.   Once, he said he assigned Kagan to paint a bulkhead, but knew hewould have to keep an eye on him to make sure he used the rightpaint and brush.   Yet Kunkel credited Hazelwood with keeping everyone calm aboardship and said he made prudent decisions in the wake of thegrounding.   The second mate, Lloyd LeCain, said he had assessed Kagan'scapabilities as ``slightly below normal.''   ``I talked to Capt. Hazelwood about it,'' he testified. ``Heknew he had a problem. He told me to keep an eye on him when he wassteering.''   But Hazelwood's defense team immediately attacked LeCain'scrediblity, telling the judge that LeCain was on leave from Exxonfor mental problems. They asked that the jury be told that LeCainhad boasted of being a submarine commander in the Falklands, aGreen Beret in Vietnam and a figure in the Iran-Contra affair.   Defense lawyer Dick Madson said that when Hazelwood left hisship after the accident, LeCain approached him and said he had twocyanide pills in case he needed to commit suicide, saying he was``Ninja trained.''   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone ruled that jurors should nothear these allegations because they were confusing and constitued``character evidence'' not permitted under Alaska law.   And then there was crew member Maureen Jones, who was thelookout. When the Exxon Valdez grounded she said she saw ``anaura'' around the bow of the ship which she could not explain. Shedescribed it as ``a greenish glow.''   For Hazelwood, who has a history of drunken driving convictionsand is accused of intoxication on the fateful night, one factmentioned by every crew member was important. They said the captainseemed sober and in command after the accident and denied smellingalcohol on his breath. Blood and urine tests taken about 10 hoursafter the accident showed alcohol in his system and an investigatorsmelled liquor on him.   ``What was the captain's demeanor?'' Kunkel was asked about thehours after the grounding.   ``Very sullen but all business,'' he replied. ``Cool, calm, incharge.''</TEXT></DOC>
