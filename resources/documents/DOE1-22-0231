The correlation between flattening of plasma current profileand energy confinement improvement was demonstrated by controlling N/sub11/ spectrum of current drive and heating launchers. The maximum electrontemperature of 6 kW was achieved with 2.4 MW LH injection in electronheating mode. Non-inductive driven current of 2 MA with 2.5 sec durationwas demonstrated with 3 MW LHRF injection. Substantial acceleration ofNB injected fast ions up to 160 kW was observed during ICRF + NB (60keV) injection. In low density high power NB injected limiter discharges,high ion temperature of {similar_to} 11 keV and electron temperatureof 5 keV were obtained with Z/sub eff/ = 5. Various attempts were madeto produce H-mode in divertor and limiter discharges.</TEXT></DOC>
