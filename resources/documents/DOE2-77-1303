From the long range outlookof the supply-demand situation, the long and stable supply of LNG isappreciated, and the demand for city gas will continue to grow at a higherrate than other kinds of energy. For the actualization of this outlook,however, further efforts for stable supply and cost reduction are required.Although three of the major companies are taking the lead in the conversionof existing raw materials to LNG, this strategy should also be appliedby other companies to cover wider areas. For spherical gas holders whichare largely contributing for the stable supply of gas and the safetymaintenance of facilities, the improvement of inspection and maintenancemethods and the introduction of a failure diagnosis system should activelybe promoted. From the viewpoint of a long-ranged strategy, the diversificationof raw materials will be important. Furthermore, it is vital to makean effort for the commercial production of SNG and the practical useof methanol gas and to develop an approach for the future technologyfrom a broad outlook of the industry.
