Ronald Hovell, 400 miles away from thedebate on the size of his paycheck, considered time his greatestenemy. Marylouise Uhlig, here in the middle of it all, dropped RalphNader from her list of heroes.   Both were on the verge of getting big pay increases but saw theirhopes dashed. A House plan to let the controversial federal payraises become law collapsed, and the pay package was scuttled justhours before it was to take effect.   ``I was just hoping the clock would tick faster than it did,''said Hovell, a civilian deputy chief of staff for the Air ForceLogistics Command in Dayton, Ohio. ``I've got to admit that I'm downemotionally, more than I was the first time.''   The first time was four years ago _ the last time a presidentialcommission recommended big pay hikes for Congress, federal judgesand senior government executives. Congress rejected those, too, inthe face of public outcry.   This time was Tuesday, when the House caved in to mountingpressure and passed a resolution rejecting the raises scheduled totake effect at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday. The Senate quickly followedsuit and the measure was signed by President Bush.   ``The mood is very, very bleak,'' said Uhlig, an EnvironmentalProtection Agency official. Like Hovell and 7,112 others at the toplevels of career civil service, she was due to receive a payincrease under the plan.   A majority of the executives live and work in the Washingtonarea, where the pay plan has been the talk of the town. Now there istalk of leaving.   ``I was very optimistic until two days ago,'' Uhlig said.``Somehow it got off track. It's very demoralizing, verydiscouraging. There is really going to be a great exodus of people.''   Turnover among the executives averages 10 percent a year and isdouble that among recipients of the presidential distinguished rankaward, a bonus program for the government's top managers.   Hovell is among the winners of the award. His work includeshelping draft the Air Force's five-year budget plan and affects morethan 100,000 people.   ``If I were eligible I would leave,'' said Hovell, a 32-yeargovernment employee who won't reach pension eligibility for anotherfive years, when he turns 55. ``And if I were on the outside I'dthink twice about a government career.''   Carol Bonosaro suggests talented managers or college graduateswon't even think once about government service now.   ``The American taxpayer might like taking pot shots at Congressbut the net result is that the taxpayer is going to be the loser,''said Bonosaro, president of the Senior Executive Association, anorganization representing the senior managers. ``We are not going tobe able to keep career executives in government and we're going tosee a lower quality of people serving in these jobs and the programswill suffer.''   Members of the government's senior executive service received a4.1 percent cost-of-living raise in January and now make from$68,700 to $80,700. The scale would have been from $80,000 to$120,000 under the plan killed Tuesday, costing the government $112million for the rest of this fiscal year and all of next year.   ``The reaction has been a lot of talk about filling out theretirement papers,'' Bonosaro said. ``How can you go home and lookat your family and say you're staying again at a salary half whatthey can earn in the private sector.''   Uhlig, 21 years a government employee, said, ``We're going tohave a crisis in the public service.'' And she blames Nader, theconsumer advocate she says she once admired.   ``He was a hero of mine,'' Uhlig said of the man who helped leadopposition to the pay raises.   There was talk that Bush would propose legislation to givefederal judges and the executives raises.   But Hovell wasn't expecting good news from Washington.   ``I don't have any hope that it will happen,'' he said. ``I'mglad I didn't go to the point where I was really spending themoney.''</TEXT></DOC>
