 With profit more difficult to make, thevendors with the strongest customer relation skills will forgeahead.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Strategic PlanningMarketing StrategyBusiness PlanningUser RelationsComputer IndustryCompetitionVendors.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Firms must address people issues to achieve successandM;As a consultant dealing with many computer companies, I have often seen manysenior managers of computer vendors cling to the hope that their newwhiz-bang system will solve all their worldly problems.andM;The belief goes back to the early days of the computer industry when a salewas much easier to close.andP;  It was simply a matter of being trained on theproduct, learning how to sell it and then attack the marketplace.andM;At the risk to dating myself, I remember IBM's announcement of thatrevolution in data processing, the 96 column card.andP;  In retrospect, we sold abunch of systems because of it.andP;  Further, I can even recall going out to sellsystems to accounts where there was no competitor.andM;So what has changed?andP;  Well almost everything.andM;Today's market characteristics include:andM;* Product proliferation in every segment including mainframes, minis, PCs,communications and chips;andM;* Fierce competition from all kinds of companies ranging in size fromworldwide operations to basement operations;andM;* Better-informed buyers;andM;* More strategic use of computer systems.andP;  From using computers for backoffice functions such as payroll and general ledger, the technology is nowemployed for retail point-of-sale systems, airline reservations etc.andM;* Decrease in the cost of computing power as measured in MIPS;andM;* Lower margins for vendors making it tougher to make a profit;andM;* The advent of nonproprietary operating systems, freeing users from blindproduct loyalty and forced repeat business;andM;* Increased specialization and the need for major vendors to developmulti-level distribution and support organizations.andP;  Since most vendorsstarted off with a dedicated sales forces, many are still wrestling with howto get a successful distribution system in place.andM;What has to change for computer vendors to be successful in the 1990s?andP;  Ibelieve that vendors must switch their focus from product innovation topeople management.andP;  I do not mean that the computer vendors should stopproduct development but must also focus on organizational and people issues.andM;Computer industry should follow Pizza PizzaandM;All the successful technology vendors in the 1990s must have strong productsand product development strategies.andP;  As technology becomes more and more acommodity, the vendors must look at and learn from other successful commodityvendors.andM;At the risk of oofending 90 per cent of the computer professionals in theworld.andP;  I believe the computer industry must start to behave more like PizzaPizza and other commodity vendors.andP;  Although I am not an expert on pizzas, Ido know that Pizza Pizza &quot;moves a lotta pizzas.&quot;andP;  And I suspect that theirpizza doesn't even have to be the best on the market.andM;Having a sound, focused business strategy and plan sounds easy and mostcomputer vendors would claim that they have one.andP;  But usually companies gotoo far one way or the other.andM;Either companies have strategies and plans that are so big and detailed thatnoone understands them, or they have a few numeric goals with no real plan ofhow to realize them.andM;Let's face it, except for a very small group of big technology vendors, thesmaller ones cannot be all things to all people.andP;  To be successful, they mustdevelop focussed strategies and plans.andM;In fact, the bigger ones have to do the same thing, except that they need todevelop a range of focused sub-strategies that focus on each of the manyareas that they wish to succeed in.andP;  As one of my clients puts it: &quot;Every daywe see so many opportunities that our biggest problem is how to say no sothat we stick to what we are good at.&quot;andM;The test of a strategy or plan is simple.andP;  Ask: Is it focused?andP;  Does it makesense?andP;  Has it been communicated to everyone in the Company?andP;  Does everyoneknow and commit to their piece of it?andM;My company has just acquired the marketing rights to a unique ProductivityAssessment Tool that actually measures a company on eight major vaiableswhich are proven to contribute to individual white collar productivity.andP;  Thetool assesses the variables at three levels: executives views; middlemanagement views; and individual contributor views.andM;The data collected is fed into a database so that, no only can a companycalibrate itself on an absolute scale, but also in relation to the averagecompany on the database.andP;  If you look at this average company, the executiveview in almost exactly opposite to the individual contributor's view and themiddle managers are in 'no man's land.'andM;My point is that the average company has wide gaps between the executives andthe front line staff who are supposed to lead the charge.andM;The irony to me is that these internal problems are the easiest ones to fix.andO;I addressed the gap between top and bottom once by developing a presentationthat described our company, its products, its strategy, mission and vision,and then insisting that everyone in sales and marketing be able to deliverit.andM;Whereas I would not pretend my fix was the perfect solution for all time, itwas interesting to see how the same people who complained about the lack ofclear vision and direction changed and grew pride in the company when theyhad to tell the story themselves.andM;For reasons that escape me, many companies seem to focus on their internalproblems and issues to the total exclusion of anything to do with theirmarkets and customers.andM;Today, with computers being used in the very leading edge of company'soperations, it is doubly important to have a clear view of your customer andtheir opportunities and problems.andM;Finally, the elusive two words that everyone uses, but few strive for:Customer satisfaction.andP;  Pizza Pizza has built itself by satisfying customerswithin a very specific time frame, and of course, has set the standard forcompetitors to match or exceed.andM;Peak PerformanceandM;A determined team of people can do anazing things.andP;  I once took a district ofa computer company from $20 to $41 million in one year, a year that was not aparticularly good one for the economy.andP;  Why was this?andP;  Well in some weird andwonderful way, the group of 65-odd people spread across western Canada founda clear focus on their goals and built a camaraderie based on a determinationto succeed in their individual and overall goals.andP;  Guess what, they did it.andM;In retrospect, when you looked at the levels of training and experience ofthat team, any expert from outside would have said it was an impossible task.andO;Fortunately, neither the individuals involved, nor I, knew any better.andM;A colleague of mine criticized my words &quot;success-oriented&quot; and suggested itshould be &quot;successful&quot;.andM;My response was and is that, unfortunately, many of the people out here maynot be successful.andP;  today.andP;  However, they have to see how to dig themselvesout and become successful, to have a burning desire to succeed in the shortand long term.andM;The role of the middle manager is pivotal.andP;  If they cannot show their newerpeople what success is and how to reach it, then those new people areextremely unlikely to succeed.andM;So what does all of this add up to?andP;  My belief is that the technology winnersof the 1990s will have these attributes.andP;  It all boils down to better qualityof management, and simply, a recognition of people issues.andM;Peter Michie is president of Canadian Computer Marketing Consultants, aToronto-based management consultant company that specializes in the hightechnology industry.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
