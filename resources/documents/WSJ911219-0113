In an attack on the president's economic reform programand its architect, Vice President Alexander Rutskoi chargedin an interview with Nezavisimaya Gazeta yesterday that thereforms would lead to anarchy, not to a market economy.&quot;Everything is falling into an abyss -- the economy, financesand the people's trust. . . . While we talk about reforms,the situation worsens catastrophically.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Rutskoi's attacks in part reflect the isolation hefeels from the president. He has long complained that Mr.Yeltsin is surrounded by a clique of cronies from his hometown of Sverdlovsk who keep out anyone with differingopinions.   But the vice president's opposition is more potentiallythreatening to Russian reforms than ordinary politicalinfighting would be. Mr. Rutskoi never shared Mr. Yeltsin'sviews -- and he was chosen as a running mate last spring forprecisely that reason, to build a coalition with Russia'sconservative military-industrial complex.   &quot;Rutskoi's understanding of economic reform is on thelevel of Gosplan,&quot; the old Soviet central planning agency,said Dmitri Ostalsky, political editor of NezavisimayaGazeta. &quot;He thinks everything will be all right if we getback Gosplan. He's a Communist in all his ideas.&quot;   As a hero of the Afghanistan war and a believer of reformfrom within the Communist Party, Mr. Rutskoi has the supportof other war veterans and the huge and economically powerfulindustrial machine connected with the military. At the timeof the Russian presidential election, it was this group'sbacking that Mr. Yeltsin needed to beat more conservativecandidates such as former Soviet Prime Minister NikolaiRyzhkov. Now, Mr. Rutskoi could provide a rallying point forthat same group when the harsh realities of radical reformcause more pain.   Mr. Rutskoi has increasingly been at odds with his bosssince he was made the scapegoat for Mr. Yeltsin's blunderedattempt to crack down on an independence drive in the Russianregion of Chechen-Ingush last month. Then in Siberia, whilevisiting military installations that were in terriblecondition and homeless Soviet troops, the vice presidentopenly criticized the Russian plan to liberalize pricesbefore privatizing industry and warned that Mr. Yeltsincouldn't meet his promise to bring economic stablization bynext autumn.   Mr. Rutskoi avoids attacking Mr. Yeltsin directly,complaining instead that the president's circle keeps the twomen from seeing one another. In the interview he said that inthe past six months he hasn't been allowed so much as acouple of hours with the president.   He also sneers at the president's team of deputy primeministers, saying they lack the experience to carry outreforms. One of Mr. Rutskoi's targets is Deputy PrimeMinister Yegor Gaidar, architect of the economic reformprogram. Mr. Gaidar recently aggravated the fear in militarycircles, already worried about job losses, by saying Russiawould cut its military budget severely next year.   Yesterday, Mr. Gaidar explained that troops would still bepaid and defense manufacturers would be helped to converttheir production lines to make consumer goods. He respondedcoolly to Mr. Rutskoi's attacks, implying that his nemesis isbeing irresponsible, criticizing policies over which heneedn't take responsibility.   &quot;I don't think President Yeltsin shares the view of thevice president,&quot; said Mr. Gaidar. &quot;The president hasunderlined that it was necessary for him to bear this risk ofimplementing tough but essential measures. He can't shift hisresponsibility to anyone else's shoulders, and he isn'tinterested in playing any political games.&quot;   Some political and economic analysts aren't sure of Mr.Yeltsin's commitment to tough reforms. They point to hisfailure to assuage reformers by sacking the president of theRussian state bank, who favors old-style central control.&quot;It's very difficult to carry out reforms when the centralbank president isn't playing on the same team,&quot; says MikhailBerger, economic analyst at Izvestia newspaper.   Meanwhile, pressure is growing on Mr. Yeltsin as theformer Soviet Union undergoes wrenching upheaval. OnSaturday, the three founding republics of the newCommonwealth of Independent States, Russia, Byelorussia andthe Ukraine, will meet with five or six other republics tosign their agreement. But cracks are already forming in theostensibly friendly commonwealth agreement.   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker on a trip to variousrepublics found Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayevcool to Russia's bid to take over the Soviet Union's UnitedNations Security Council seat. Mr. Nazarbayev also opposesRussia's plan to retain nuclear weapons after Kazakhstan, theUkraine and Byelorussia give theirs up.   On Tuesday in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, liberalopposition Parliament member Stepan Khmara also worried aboutRussian imperialism. &quot;Russia can't be a strategic partner forus in the near future. For us, Russia is the main opponent,&quot;he said. &quot;Yeltsin is trying to solve his problems atUkraine's cost. The internal politics are causing his nationto fall apart.&quot;   Still, after meeting Mr. Baker yesterday, President LeonidKravchuk said the Ukraine will become non-nuclear regardlessof what Russia does. He said he expects the U.S. to supportUkrainian independence.   ---   Natalia A. Fedushak in Kiev contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
