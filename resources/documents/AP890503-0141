Rehnquist, in anextraordinary personal appearance before Congress, tried to rallysupport Wednesday for raising federal judges' salaries 30 percent.   Becoming the first chief justice in some 50 years to testifybefore Congress, Rehnquist acknowledged that many Americans thinkfederal judges already are paid handsomely.   But he called current judicial salaries inadequate and said theywould cause ``more resignations from the bench, more damage to themorale of those judges who remain and more difficulty in recruitingnew judges.''   Rehnquist told the House Post Office and Civil Service Committeethat a 30 percent pay hike is needed immediately, but ChairmanWilliam Ford, D-Mich., indicated the committee is not likely totake any action until next fall at the earliest.   Proposed legislation, backed by the Rehnquist-chaired U.S.Judicial Conference, would provide federal judges with a 30 percentpay raise and regular cost-of-living adjustments.   President Bush has proposed a 25 percent increase along with aban on speaking fees and a limit on outside earned income.   A 30 percent increase would boost the chief justice's annualsalary from $115,000 to $149,500. Salaries of Supreme Courtjustices would rise from $110,000 to $143,000; appeals court judgesfrom $95,000 to $123,000; and trial judges from $89,500 to $116,500.   There are about 700 active federal judges. About 300 others areon senior status, doing as much or as little work as they wish. Allreceive the same raises.   Responding to committee questions, Rehnquist said, ``I realizethat many people have difficulty understanding why people making$89,000 need 25 or 30 percent more ... I have wracked my brain(about) how to get this over to the American people.''   He added, ``I hope I have not overstated the case ... Judgesaren't constantly saying, `How am I going to pay the rent.' That'snot what's happening.''   Rehnquist called the proposed pay increase ``a partial recaptureof the tremendous decline in purchasing power that has affectedjudicial salaries over the last 20 years.''   He added, ``I know there may be a feeling abroad that lawyersmake too much money, but so long as judges are recruited fromlawyers we must take into consideration the fact of how muchlawyers are paid.''   Rehnquist said current judicial salaries may not attract lawyersfrom the nation's larger cities because they can earn much more inprivate practice. ``I fear that is what is beginning to happen,''he said.   Several committee members were clearly sympathetic.   Rep. Constance Morella, R-Md., said ``federal judges are amongthe lowest paid attorneys in America's legal system today'' whenage and experience levels are considered.   Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., said, ``There's no question that theneed is there. I think the judges deserve a raise.''   But Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., pointedly told Rehnquist,``This country has a great economic problem.''   Noting that representatives of the executive and legislativebranches had preceded the chief justice in seeking support forwide-ranging pay increases, Schroeder said, ``This hearing is theclosing of the greed cycle. I find this tragic.''   Rehnquist also emphasized the importance of routinecost-of-living adjustments in judicial salaries, which he said``could well obviate the need for the sort of sizable `catch-up'increases'' being proposed.   Currently, federal judges receive the periodic raises given tomost federal employees by Congress.   ``Congress' historical reluctance to increase its own pay levelshas often meant that cost-of-living increases for other seniorgovernment officials have also been denied,'' Rehnquist said.   Federal judges actually have received cost-of-living increasesin most years since 1975. During that period, trial judges'salaries have risen from $42,000 to $89,500 and appellate courtsalaries from $44,600 to $95,000.   Last week, five Democratic and Republican members of the Housecourts subcommittee advised a panel of leading judges that publicprotests likely would block any judicial pay raise unlessnon-working senior judges were excluded. The judges opposed suchlimits.   The Associated Press earlier this year reported previouslyunpublished federal figures showing that in 1987 some 20 percent ofthe then-306 senior judges did no judicial work, including formerChief Justice Warren Burger.   Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., and Rep. Carlos Moorhead,R-Calif., chairman and ranking minority member on the subcommittee,subsequently submitted legislation to bar pay raises other thancost-of-living increases from senior judges who carry less than 25percent of an active judge's caseload.   Supreme Court spokeswoman Toni House said it is believed thatthe last chief justice who testified before Congress was CharlesEvans Hughes, whose tenure lasted from 1930 to 1941.</TEXT></DOC>
