Ms. Sedlacek ended up losing $26,000. And the dealer waslater put into receivership at the request of the FederalTrade Commission.</LP><TEXT>   Sadly, Ms. Sedlacek's experience isn't unusual. Thousandsof investors, many elderly, have lost tens of millions ofdollars in such investments. The twist to this tale, however,is how she plans to get her money back: going after the bankthat made her the loan to buy $27,000 worth of platinum.   In a federal court lawsuit filed in 1990, Ms. Sedlacek issuing SafraBank (California) of Encino, Calif., along withthe precious metals dealer, Morgan Whitney Trading Group ofVenice, Calif., and its principals. Also named as a defendantin the class-action suit, filed in federal district court incentral California, is international financier Edmond Safra,who owns SafraBank and 29% of another defendant, Republic NewYork Corp., parent of Republic National Bank of New York,which participated in SafraBank precious metals loans througha Texas subsidiary.   Ms. Sedlacek's suit claims that SafraBank is asresponsible for investor losses as the commodities salesmenwho she alleges misled her into the precious metalsinvestments. Ms. Sedlacek's attorneys, who are handling fourother similar lawsuits naming as defendants SafraBank anddifferent brokers, estimate that the five suits could involveas much as $60 million lost by some 9,000 investors.   All told, SafraBank is facing 19 lawsuits from investorslike Ms. Sedlacek who borrowed money to buy precious metalsfrom brokers. One of those suits was filed by the state ofIowa, which is suing Morgan Whitney and SafraBank on behalfof 46 Iowa residents whom the state estimates lost $500,000.In its suit, Iowa alleges that Morgan Whitney and SafraBankviolated Iowa laws on consumer fraud, securities, commoditiesand consumer credit. The state claims that SafraBank acted inconcert with Morgan Whitney to defraud consumers bymisrepresenting or omitting facts about precious metalsinvestments.   In a typical bank-financed precious metals deal, acommodities salesman persuades an investor to buy thousandsof dollars worth of gold, silver or platinum bullion or coinsby putting down about 20% of the price in cash and financingthe balance with a bank loan.   SafraBank isn't the only lender making bank-financedprecious metals loans, but it considers itself a pioneer inthe field and at one time was one of the largest lenders, abank official says. Over the years, SafraBank has beeninvolved in more than 10,000 bank-financed precious metalsloans, a SafraBank attorney says.   Investors allege in lawsuits that the telemarketingsalesmen who sold them precious metals didn't tell them thatafter paying high sales commissions, interest on the loansand other fees, investors had little chance of recoupingtheir investment, much less making money on it. And, thesuits allege, investors weren't told they were obligated bySafraBank to put up additional funds if precious metalsprices fell below certain levels.   SafraBank, through a spokesman, says it believes thelawsuits are without merit.   The bank isn't privy to discussions between salesmen andborrowers, a SafraBank official says. Moreover, the bank'sbrochures and loan documents carry disclaimers to protect thebank from such claims, the SafraBank spokesman says. Thebank's position is that it is the duty of the borrower todecide how to use the loan proceeds, and to be informed aboutthe investment, says a SafraBank attorney. &quot;The decision toenter a particular transaction has to be the borrower's andnot the bank's,&quot; he says.   The potential liability and cost of litigation, however,prompted SafraBank to decide recently to get out ofbank-financed precious metals lending within a year, the bankspokesman says.   State regulators applaud the investors' attempts to holdbanks responsible. &quot;The financial institutions like to tellyou they're completely independent and not responsible forwhat salespeople say,&quot; says Lawrence Fuchs, Florida deputycomptroller. &quot;We think that's nonsense.&quot; The commoditiesbrokers don't give the customer a choice of financialinstitutions, he argues, and without the bank the salewouldn't be made. &quot;For the financial institution to claimthey're not an integral part of the scheme is ludicrous,&quot;says Mr. Fuchs.   Experts on lender liability say that banks generallyaren't required to protect borrowers from their buying orinvestment decisions, even if the bankers suspect shadydealings. &quot;The general rule on banks and lending and fraud isthat a bank is under no duty to disclose information it mayhave,&quot; says Thomas Greco, associate general counsel for theAmerican Bankers Association.   The question comes down to whether the bank had afiduciary responsibility to protect the borrower, saysKenneth Scott, Ralph M. Parsons professor of law and businessat Stanford Law School. Granting a loan would not create afiduciary responsibility because the bank and borrower are onopposite sides of a transaction, he says.   But investors are arguing that SafraBank was more than anindifferent lender. The lawsuits charge that SafraBank workedhand-in-hand with the salesmen to sell the precious metalsinvestments. Besides lending money, SafraBank also lentcredibility to the operators, they argue, by allowing them touse its name and its Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.protection in sales pitches. A SafraBank official denies thebank allowed brokers to use its name and FDIC insurance insales pitches.   Moreover, SafraBank played a central role by aggressivelypromoting bank-financed precious metals to dealers and makingrecommendations on how to set up such programs, attorneys forMs. Sedlacek claim. &quot;We view the dealers as creatures ofSafraBank,&quot; says Richard Heimann, Ms. Sedlacek's attorney inSan Francisco. A SafraBank official denies the bank solicitedbusiness from brokers or worked actively in their businesses.   And there are practical reasons for angry investors to goafter SafraBank and Republic Bank. At the first sign oftrouble, boiler-room commodities operators typicallydisappear, taking investors' money with them, Mr. Heimannsays, so there's little hope of recovering from them.   SafraBank officials aren't strangers to such suits. A bankattorney says it has faced similar claims in the past andthey haven't held up: SafraBank was dismissed from the casesor the parties agreed to settle for nominal amounts. Noneever made it to a jury, the attorney says.   But one case involving Ned Fenton, the head of SafraBank'sprecious metals operation, did go to a Los Angeles federalcourt jury, which found in 1986 that he had violated civilanti-racketeering laws when he ran the precious metalsfinancing operation for West Coast Bank. That operation wasacquired by Mr. Safra when he bought the assets of failedWest Coast in 1984; however, the transactions at issue in thetrial occured before Mr. Safra acquired the bank operation.   The FDIC, as receiver for West Coast Bank, was also heldin violation. The verdict was set aside and the suitdismissed after a settlement was reached, Mr. Fenton's lawyerpoints out.   In 1988, the FDIC itself raised warning flags in anexaminer's report saying that SafraBank's precious metalslending practices made the bank potentially liable for lossesby customers of the precious metals brokers.   SafraBank says it has responded satisfactorily to anyissues raised by bank regulators. Federal and stateregulators have conducted many examinations since 1988, aSafraBank offical says, and found the bank's operationssatisfactory.   But it still faces lawsuits by investors.   Ms. Sedlacek says that when she received her firsttelephone call from a Morgan Whitney salesman, she wasunconvinced by his claims that platinum prices would soonrise to $800 an ounce from $539. She was won over, however,when the salesman spoke of SafraBank's affiliation with hisfirm.   &quot;It made me feel a little secure about buying from thesepeople because I felt they had the backing of this bank,&quot;says Ms. Sedlacek. &quot;I thought they were regulated by somegovernment agency, and with the backing of Safra, I had noreason to believe they weren't legitimate outfits.&quot;   Adding to that perception, the salesman instructed Ms.Sedlacek to make out the check for her down payment directlyto SafraBank, she says. And all brochures, documentation,loan materials and receipts came from SafraBank, her lawyerssay.   Feeling secure that she was investing through a federallyinsured bank, Ms. Sedlacek paid an initial $10,233 toSafraBank to buy $27,000 of platinum, according to documentsshe filed in the lawsuit. SafraBank sent her papers for a$22,100 loan, bringing the total cost of the platinum, fees,interest, and commission to more than $32,000. Platinumprices would have had to rise 18.5%, or an unlikely $100 anounce, over the six-month term of the loan before Ms.Sedlacek would break even.   She later incurred thousands of dollars in additionalcosts to renew the loan and to meet a surprise demand foradditional capital when platinum prices fell, she says. Sheagreed to switch into silver at Morgan Whitney's urging, butwhen the salesman tried to push Norman Rockwell coins, sheturned to a coin-dealer friend, who warned her against theinvestment. &quot;That made me realize these people weren'tprofessionals like they claimed to be,&quot; she says. &quot;I wassick, and I was angry.&quot;   Ms. Sedlacek says she wrote a letter detailing herexperience to the office of the California State AttorneyGeneral, which in turn notified the Federal Trade Commission.In response to a complaint filed by the FTC, the U.S.District Court for the Central District of Californiaappointed a receiver for Morgan Whitney in 1990, allegingthat the firm made false and misleading claims and failed todisclose material information in selling precious metals.Last August, Morgan Whitney and its principals, while denyingany wrongdoing, settled the FTC complaint.   Morgan Whitney was just one of many operators ofbank-financed precious metals programs that worked throughSafraBank.   Last night, lawyers for SafraBank and precious metalsinvestors were in settlement talks regarding the fivelawsuits being handled by Ms. Sedlacek's lawyers. A spokesmanfor SafraBank and Republic New York Corp. said a settlement&quot;will not be material for Republic New York Corp., RepublicNational Bank of New York, or Mr. Safra. It's also not goingto be material to SafraBank (California) because Mr. Safra,its sole shareholder, stands fully behind the bank.&quot;   In one of the largest individual suits, 74-year-old BettyMoore Stowers of Topeka, Kan., through her conservator,Merchants National Bank of Topeka, sued SafraBank, AmericanFinancial Reserve Corp. and others in 1990 to recover $1.4million she allegedly lost in precious-metals investmentsmade through American Financial, of Newport Beach, Calif.   SafraBank is also named as a defendant in lawsuits byinvestors who bought precious metals through Western MonetaryConsultants. Western Monetary, formerly based in Denver butnow in San Diego, filed for bankruptcy-law protection in1988, according to William Kennedy, who headed the firm.   Between 1982 and 1988, Western Monetary sold $400 millionin precious metals to 3,000 clients, Mr. Kennedy says. About600 investors with $18 million in investments were caught inthe bankruptcy proceedings, he says, adding that he plansfull restitution within 10 years.</TEXT></DOC>
