This sodium films evaporatedonto a glass substrate were blown off by a Q-switched ruby laser pulse.The enhanced shortening of the pulse of neutrals was observed along thebeam propagating toward the plasma centre by measuring the resonancelight intensity of atoms excited by plasma electrons. The transport ofsodium atoms injected into the plasma and that of the intrinsic impuritieswas investigated. The measurement of the intensity of the impurity atomicline is used for the determination of the impurity containment time.(R.P.) 21 refs.; 8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
