The commission's proposed consent agreement, approved by a 3-1 vote, sets the stage for Salt Lake City-based American Stores to become the nation's largest supermarket chain.    In order to obtain federal antitrust clearance, American Stores promised that the merged companies will divest itself of as many as 37 stores in the important California market, along with interests in other stores in Illinois, Iowa and Indiana. The proposed agreement is subject to a 60-day period for public comment, after which commissioners will decide whether to make it final.    In a formal complaint filed along with the proposed settlement, the commission concluded that the planned merger could substantially reduce competition in parts of California, especially the San Francisco Bay region. Under the proposed consent agreement, American Stores would have six months to find buyers suitable to the commission for as many as 21 stores in northern California. After that, the agency could name a trustee to complete the divestitures.    Commissioners also proposed that for 10 years, the merged firm would have to obtain prior government approval to acquire additional retail outlets in certain parts of California.    Analysts have said they expect American Stores' faltering Alpha Beta division to be folded into Lucky's operations, making Lucky the supermarket powerhouse in major California markets.    American Stores operates approximately 1,600 stores in 39 states. The commission didn't break out the revenue generated by its California operations.    Under the proposed agreement, American Stores must divest itself of Lucky's interest in Eagle Food Centers L.P., which operates more than 100 stores in the Midwest, to New York-based Odyssey Partners. A closely held investment firm, Odyssey already owns the controlling interest in the chain of Eagle stores.    Commissioner Mary Azcuenaga, who cast the dissenting vote, argued that the agency &quot;should require the divestiture of a greater number of stores&quot; in parts of California. She also objected to the majority's decision to permit American Stores to acquire, or reacquire, one store each year in the San Francisco area without commission approval or review.    In Salt Lake City, American Stores said in a statement that it must shed 25 grocery stores in certain markets. Moreover, the company said it would have to sell off an additional undetermined number of stores to satisfy the FTC's proposed consent agreement.    A company spokesman said he couldn't elaborate. Nor could he say how many Lucky shares had been tendered through yesterday. American Stores' offer for Lucky expires at midnight tonight and is contingent on receipt of a majority of Lucky's common shares outstanding. </TEXT></DOC>
