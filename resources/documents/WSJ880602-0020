Long-term Treasury bonds staged their biggest rally in over four months, sparking further gains in stocks.    The prices of actively traded Treasury bonds climbed about 1 5/8 points, or around $16.25 for each $1,000 face amount, driving the yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond to 9.08% from 9.24% Tuesday.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 32.89 to close at 2064.01. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, 234.6 million shares, was especially impressive, because unlike other recent active sessions there weren't many volume-ballooning trades just to &quot;capture&quot; dividend payments on certain stocks.    Another barometer of investor sentiment, retail buying in the over-the-counter market, picked up smartly yesterday for the first time in weeks.    &quot;The major thing is that bonds got out of the way,&quot; said Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist for Tucker, Anthony andamp; R.L. Day Inc. &quot;As long as the bond market is rallying, the equity market will rally.&quot;    Bonds benefited early yesterday from a government report revising the index of leading economic indicators in March to 0.2% from 0.8%. The government also reported a 0.2% increase in the April index. The reports helped ease inflation jitters, traders said. But most of the bond market's gains came later in the day, as insurance companies, pension funds and other large institutional investors were rumored to be making big purchases.    A stable dollar also was credited with boosting bonds. &quot;The perspective of some of the international accounts we saw buying Treasurys was that the dollar is bottoming out,&quot; said Peter Bass, a managing director at S.G. Warburg Securities Inc. &quot;This isn't an interest-rate play. This is a currency play.&quot;    How strong the rally is and how long it will last remain open questions. While some analysts said that the rally could endure for several days or weeks, they also cited factors suggesting it is temporary and not the start of a major move upward.    &quot;Bonds, stocks and commodities all rallied, so somebody has to be wrong,&quot; said Charles Clough, the chief market strategist for Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. &quot;It looks like people were flailing at anything that trades.&quot; Many investment managers fear higher commodity prices are a harbinger of increased inflation, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates further.    Arguing that the current stock-market rally appears to be more of a technical move than a fundamental one, Mr. Clough said he would like to see further weakening in domestic consumption before reaching the conclusion that stock prices are headed substantially higher over the long term. &quot;If domestic demand were clearly weakening and the Fed was responding to that, I'd say we were home free,&quot; he said. &quot;It's coming, but it isn't here yet.&quot;    Several traders said they remain skeptical that the economy is slowing. Some said they are especially wary of a Labor Department report on the nation's employment that is to be released tomorrow morning. John R. Burrus, president and chief executive officer of CRT Government Securities Ltd. in New York, said that investors will examine the report carefully &quot;to decide if there's any more upside to the market right now.&quot;    The most important part of the Labor Department report will be the non-farm payroll employment in May. Many forecasters expect an increase of about 225,000 people on business payrolls. If the number comes in below 200,000, investment managers say, that would indicate the economy is less robust than had been thought and could ease inflation fears. That, in turn, could push bond and stock prices even higher, they say. But substantially greater employment gains could lead to another credit-tightening move by the Fed and stall rallies in both markets. </TEXT></DOC>
