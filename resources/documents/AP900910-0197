Another 23 people suffered burn injuries, police said.   They said the incident appeared related to growing rivalry amongHong Kong's organized crime syndicates, the Triads.   The men, wielding knives, burst into the club and dining hall inthe crowded Hung Hom section at 2:45 a.m., subdued a staff memberand then set the place ablaze by tossing firebombs on the floor,police said.   They escaped in a car, which had been waiting outside the firstfloor club, one of hundreds in this British colony that featuresmahjong, a Chinese game of dice and dominoes.   The blaze spread rapidly through the wood-foundation building,and was quickly upgraded to a three-alarm fire.   Firefighters extinguished the fire at 4:11 a.m. Inside, policefound six bodies. Another 23 people, 19 men and four women, weretaken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital for treatment.   In all, 40 people were in the club at the time of the attack.   The attack was the latest incident in Hong Kong's current crimewave, fueled by guns, drugs and criminals from Communist China andthe apparently growing power of local criminal gangs.   In the past two weeks, four gangs have robbed a total of $2million worth of jewelry and gold. During one robbery, an innocentbystander was killed and a 16-year-old girl taken hostage.   According to police figures, homicide is up 42 percent so farthis year, rape has jumped 24 percent and armed robbery has morethan doubled.   The growing crime rate is occurring against a backdrop ofanxieties about the future of this British crown colony after 1997,when Communist China resumes control of the territory.   China has promised to maintain Hong Kong's capitalist economicand social system for 50 years after the takeover, but few HongKong residents have faith in China's promises.   Social workers report a marked increase in young people using``soft drugs,'' such as marijuana and an amphetamine calledMandrax, which are easily smuggled in from China.   The influence of the Triads, loosely knit criminalorganizations, is also growing, possibly fueled by a sense ofhelplessness among Hong Kong's poorer youth about the colony'sfuture.</TEXT></DOC>
