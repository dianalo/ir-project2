Then, last week, the state carrier finally initialed a new union contract -- and workers promptly walked out again.    For many airlines, such disruptions could spell disaster. But this week the Italian carrier reported that 1987 profit rose 18% to 73.1 billion lire ($58.5 million) from 62.2 billion lire a year earlier.    Industry analysts agree that Alitalia has done an exceptional job despite the labor disruptions, thanks to shrewd financial management and timetable juggling.    Despite such praise, however, some analysts wonder how much longer the state-controlled airline can withstand the strike actions. If union members don't ratify the new contract this week, strikes could spill over into the heavy traffic season that begins next month. Still more ominous, analysts say, are new contract talks for pilots, flight attendants and flight engineers that loom later this year.    &quot;Easter is one of the most important weekends of the year for airlines,&quot; says Tim Coombs, an investment analyst at National Westminster Bank PLC in London. &quot;To miss out on that will hit them quite hard.&quot;    Alitalia officials wouldn't comment on the cost of the strikes. But a source familiar with the company says that even in a &quot;worst-case scenario, with strikes continuing through September,&quot; Alitalia should still be able to match 1987 profit levels.    Industry executives note that Alitalia has managed to confine most of the cancellations to domestic routes, where it has a monopoly and there is little choice but to fly Alitalia or take the train. And the trains have been hit by strikes, too.    James C. Halstead, airline analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. in London, says Alitalia has &quot;a perennial strike problem, but they seem to manage quite well.&quot; He says scheduling changes have helped smooth over some of the disruptions.    Because it is ground staff that is striking now, plane maintenance has been one of the hardest-hit sectors. But Alitalia has limited the damage by having foreign carriers provide maintenance for aircraft used on international routes.    Industry executives say the Italian carrier has used shrewd in-house cost-cutting and financing measures to keep the economic damage to a minimum. All new hiring has been frozen, overtime has been banned, new capital investments in such items as personal computers have been postponed, and rather than buy new aircraft, Alitalia has been leasing them.    &quot;The biggest imponderable will be the amount of future business they might lose if passengers get upset and change their travel habits,&quot; says David Kyd of the International Air Transport Association in Geneva. If strikes continue past this month, adds Mr. Halstead of Salomon Brothers, &quot;their problems will escalate.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
