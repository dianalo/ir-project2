The Dartmouth Review's lawsuits accuse the college of reversediscrimination against white students and of violating free speechrights for suspending three of its staffers.   The Review staffers were suspended following a confrontation ina college classroom with a black music professor who earlier hadbeen harshly criticized in the independent, off-campus newspaper.   Review attorney Harvey D. Myerson said ``the facts clearlyindicate that the students would not have been given such draconianpenalties if they were black students criticizing a whiteprofessor.''   But officials at the private liberal arts college in Hanover,N.H., said Wednesday the disciplinary action against the studentswas taken to preserve the ``integrity'' of the classroom.   Described by its critics as anti-minority, anti-women andanti-homosexual, the Review often has been the center ofcontroversy since it was founded in 1980.   In March of this year, Dartmouth President David Freedmanblasted the paper, calling its staff ``ideological provocateursposing as journalists.''   The faculty censured it in 1982 as racist and sexist after acritique of Dartmouth's affirmative action programs, written inwhat was intended to be black dialect and headlined: ``Dis Sho'Ain't No Jive, Bro.''   In 1984, a Review reporter secretly tape-recorded a Gay StudentsAssociation meeting and published excerpts and the names of groupleaders.   A Dartmouth disciplinary panel ruled in March that the threeReview staffers were guilty of disorderly conduct for failing toleave Professor William Cole's classroom after being asked to doso. The paper earlier had described Cole's music class as ``one ofDartmouth's most academically deficient courses.''   The paper's attorneys, who filed suits in federal and statecourts in New Hampshire, announced the action at a Capitol Hillnews conference Wednesday with support from three conservativelawmakers.   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., called the disciplinary actions``nothing less than a crude assault on freedom of expression andpolitical diversity on campus.''   ``The elite Ivy League academics constantly proclaim themselvesthe champions of free speech and diversity of opinion. Yet here,when a small band of students express a viewpoint offensive to theprevailing orthodoxy, the college comes squarely down on the sideof suppression and harsh persecution.''   Humphrey was joined at the news conference by Sen. WilliamArmstrong, R-Colo., and Rep. Bob Smith, R-N.H.   A state suit filed in New Hampshire Superior Court addresses thefree speech issue, while a federal suit filed in U.S. DistrictCourt focuses on the reverse discrimination charge.   Dartmouth spokesman Alex Huppe, who attended the newsconference, said the disciplinary action had nothing to do withFirst Amendment rights.   ``The sanctity of a classroom is what this is all about,'' Huppesaid. ``Dartmouth College has got to protect the integrity of aclassroom. They went in there to disrupt his classroom.''   Huppe accused the students of using ``bullying tactics'' intheir confrontation with the professor and their refusal to leave.   After the classroom incident, Freedman, the college president,said the paper had been ``irresponsible, mean-spirited, cruel andugly'' and that it was trying to poison the ``intellectualenvironment'' of the campus.</TEXT></DOC>
