The SEC charges are the first to result from the government's expanded investigation in the wake of the &quot;Yuppie Five&quot; insider-trading case. Andrew Solomon, a former Schloss securities analyst, was one of the five who pleaded guilty to insider-trading charges in that case.    In a civil fraud complaint, the SEC charged Ronald Yagoda, a former top arbitrager at Schloss, with trading on inside information in five stocks. In a separate complaint, the SEC cited Schloss for alleged illegal trading in three of the same five stocks. The complaints, filed in federal court in Manhattan, had been expected.    Without admitting or denying guilt, Schloss agreed to give up $136,900 in allegedly illegal trading profits and also to pay penalties of twice that amount, or $273,800, under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984. The firm also consented to an injunction barring future violations and agreed to be censured by the SEC.    Schloss said Mr. Yagoda, a former principal and head of trading, resigned last week to fight the government's charges. The firm added that it &quot;fully supports Mr. Yagoda and his decision to defend himself vigorously until he is fully vindicated.&quot;    According to the SEC complaints, inside information on pending stock transactions was allegedly passed from Michael David, a former associate with the law firm of Paul Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrison, to Mr. Solomon. Mr. Solomon then passed the information to Mr. Yagoda, who allegedly used the data to make advantageous trades for Schloss.    Mr. Solomon pleaded guilty to trading on inside information in 1986; Mr. David also pleaded guilty to insider-trading charges in the Yuppie Five case and has settled related civil charges with the SEC.    Schloss said the settlement &quot;reflects Marcus Schloss's responsibility for (Andrew) Solomon as his employer. It enables the firm to put this matter to rest and to proceed without any interruption or limitation upon its business activities.&quot;    Mr. Yagoda's attorney, Stanley S. Arkin, said, &quot;There is no way that he (Mr. Yagoda) did or would have used any improper information provided by Andrew Solomon or anyone else.&quot;    The SEC alleged that Schloss learned in December 1985 of GAF Corp.'s pending hostile bid for Union Carbide Corp. and bought 10,000 Carbide shares, as authorized by Mr. Yagoda, several days before GAF's offer.    One of the two other transactions named in both SEC complaints involved a purchase of 20,000 Avondale Mills shares a week before Dominion Textile Inc. announced a tender offer. The other transaction was the March 10, 1986, purchase of 3,700 American Brands Inc. shares that were sold a day later for a profit. At that time, B.A.T Industries PLC was considering a takeover bid for American Brands.    Schloss obtained illegal trading profits of $39,575 on Carbide shares, $87,500 on Avondale Mills and $9,825 on American Brands, according to the SEC.    The SEC complaint against Mr. Yagoda alleged transactions that could result in charges being brought against an &quot;investment firm&quot; that the agency wouldn't identify.    The SEC said Mr. Yagoda advised Mr. David to sell short the securities of Revco D.S. Inc. Mr. Yagoda considered Revco's stock overvalued because of confidential data he obtained when Schloss was approached to join in a leveraged buy-out of Revco, the complaint said. Mr. David subsequently passed on Mr. Yagoda's tip to the unidentified investment firm, which allegedly shorted Revco's stock for its customers, generating profits of about $4,868, the SEC said. Short sellers sell borrowed shares, expecting their price to drop and generate a profit as less costly shares are returned to the lender.    The SEC suit also accused Mr. Yagoda of buying Allegheny International Inc. stock after learning of &quot;corporate transactions&quot; linking Allegheny to Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp., which was a Schloss client. The Allegheny stock was sold a week later for a $5,270 profit. The transactions, which weren't described, never went through.    As previously reported, the continuing SEC investigation into the Yuppie Five trading ring has focused on several Wall Street arbitragers, including Victor Teicher, formerly an arbitrager at Edward A. Viner andamp; Co. who now runs his own firm. Mr. Teicher's attorney, Robert Morvillo, has declined to comment on the subject. </TEXT></DOC>
