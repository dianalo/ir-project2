The Bush administration is studying whether it can do anythingto reverse the French decision, which was made personally byPresident Francois Mitterrand last month, said the officials, whospoke on condition of anonymity.   The deal calls for France to transfer to Brazil the technologyof a liquid fuel motor called Viking, which is also used in theFrench Ariane rockets, the officials said.   France has promised to place restrictions on the sale so thatthe motor is only used for peaceful space programs, but the UnitedStates contends such safeguards cannot be implemented.   U.S. officials noted that Brazil and Libya are cooperating in anattempt to develop ballistic missile boosters and said the Frenchtechnology could be passed to Libya for that project.   ``If someone like Libya wants to use this motor to harmfulpurposes, who will stop them?'' said one official.   The United States first protested the planned French sale lastJuly during the seven-nation economic summit in Paris, the officialsaid.   For a while it appeared the protest had stopped the French plan,the officials said.   But the French government reconsidered its decision when itappeared France stood to lose a lucrative contract for the launchof two Brazilian communication satellites on the Ariane launchvehicle, the officials said.   St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp., which is competing withthe French company Arianespace for the $60 million contract, wasinformed by Brazil of France's intention to transfer the Vikingtechnology to the Brazilians, the officials said.   China also bid for the launch contract but could not meet thedeadlines and withdrew, the officials said.   Word of the dispute between France and the United States wasfirst reported by Signal magazine, published by the Armed ForcesCommunications and Electronic Association.</TEXT></DOC>
