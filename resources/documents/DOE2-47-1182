<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-47-1182 </DOCNO><TEXT>The parameters of separable coupled channels s-wave potentials for thestrong {bar K}N interaction are determined from low energy K{sup -}pscattering data with additional constraints from {pi}{sup -}p {yields}{pi}{Sigma}K{sup 0} production data. The shifts and widths of the Coulombbound states in kaonic hydrogen are calculated with these potentialsand compared with experiment. Optical potentials are constructed from{bar K}N t-matrices derived from the separable potentials, and theseoptical potentials are used to calculate kaonic helium and kaonic carbonshifts and widths which are also compared with experiment. 68 refs.,50 figs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
