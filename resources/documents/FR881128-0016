In the Policy Statement, the Commissionstated that it expected to publish a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in thenear future and provided the general framework for the proposed rule. The Commission has a program to continually evaluate the operational performanceof nuclear power plants. Analysis of operational events has shown that,in some cases, nuclear power plant equipment is not being maintained ata level to ensure that the equipment will perform, with a high degree ofreliability, its intended function with required. A limited NRC examinationof nuclear power plant maintenance programs has found a wide variationin the effectiveness of these programs. At some plants, maintenance hasbeen a significant contributor to plant reliability problems and hence,is of safety concern. The Commission believes safety can and must be enhancedby strengthening the effectiveness of maintenance programs throughout thenuclear industry and this is the objective of this proposed rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Description </ITAG>It is the objective of the Commission that all components, systems andstructures of nuclear power plants be effectively maintained so that plantequipment will perform its intended function when required. The scope ofthe proposed rule is intended to cover all systems, structures and componentsincluding those in the Balance of plant (BOP). To accomplish this objective,the proposed rule would require each commercial nuclear power plant todevelop and implement a well-defined program to assure that maintenanceactivities are conducted to preserve or restore, with prompt repair, theavailability, performance and reliability of plant structures, system,and components. The program should clearly define the components and activitiesincluded, as well as the management systems used to control those activities.Further, the program should include feedback of specific results to ensurecorrective actions, provisions for overall program evaluation, and theidentification of possible component or system design problems. Compliancewith the rule would be verified by NRC audit and inspection. The proposed rule does not require that licensees report Maintenance PerformanceIndicators (MPIs). However, each licensee would be required to have hisown system for monitoring maintenance effectiveness which would be subjectto NRC review. The Commission solicits comments on the application andusefulness of MPIs as part of the rule, and whether a set of MPIs existswhich could indicate the effectiveness of plant maintenance programs. Inaddition, the Commission solicits feedback on whether to require reportinga specific set of MPIs to the NRC as part of the rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Workship </ITAG>The Commission held a Public Workshop on July 11-13, 1988 in Washington,DC to solicit early input for the formulation of the rule from the publicand regulated industry. Prior to the Workshop, a paper on rulemaking optionswas distributed to interested parties to facilitate Workshop discussions.The paper on rulemaking options,\1\<NOTE/> and the transcript and proceedings (NUREG/CP-0099) \2\<NOTE/> of the Workshops are available for inspection in the NRCPublic Document Room, 2120 L Street, Lower Level, NW., Washington, DC.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Memorandum from Victor Stello, Jr., Executive Directorfor Operations, to the Commissioners, ``Proposed Rulemaking for the Maintenanceof Nuclear Power Plants,'' dated June 27, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Copies of NUREG series reports may be purchased throughthe U.S. Government Printing Office by calling (202) 275-2060 or by writingto the U.S. Government Printing Office, P.O. Box 37082, Washington, DC20013-7082. Copies may also be purchased from the National Technical InformationService, U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield,VA 22161. A copy is available for inspection or copying for a fee in theNRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, Lower Level, NW., Washington,DC. As a result of Workshop discussions, the Commission has come to the followingconclusions: 1. Rulemaking should encourage industry initiatives directed toward improvingmaintenance, since such initiatives promote industry responsibility forproblem identification and resolution; 2. Prescriptive rulemaking options may impede industry initiatives andresponsibility to improve maintenance; and 3. Rulemaking should be directed toward specifying the NRC's expectationsin maintenance and requiring licensee monitoring of the effectiveness ofmaintenance programs. Therefore, the Commission proposes a maintenance rule which gives incentivefor industry to develop a standard for a maintenance program, which NRCmay endorse in a Regulatory Guide. <ITAG tagnum="84">Expectations for Maintenance Standard</ITAG>The Commission encourages industry to develop a Maintenance Standard whichwill provide guidance for complying with requirements of the proposed rule.The Commission believes that the development of a standard will guide currentindustry initiatives towards developing and implementing acceptable maintenanceprograms and that utility participation in preparation of a MaintenenceStandard will provide additional incentive and responsibility for improvingplant maintenence programs.The Commission plans to develop a Regulatory Guide to provide guidancefor complying with the rule if industry does not develop an adequate standard.However, the Commission prefers to endorse an industry-developed standard.To meet the Commission's plans for implementation of the rule the industrycommitment to develop a Maintenance Standard should be made now and a finalstandard should be proposed no later than September 1, 1989. The Commissionexpects to publish a Regulatory Guide endorsing a Maintenance Standardor providing NRC guidance in November 1989. The comprehensive program requirementsof the proposed rule would be required to be fully implemented within twoyears following publication of the final rule.The proposed rule defines those attributes the Commission considers necessaryfor an acceptable Maintenance Program. To be acceptable, any standard developedto implement the rule should have the following characteristics:andbullet; Should define the plant systems, structures and components includedin the maintenance program (the scope of the rule covers all systems, structuresand components including those in the BOP);andbullet; Should require a systematic evaluation (``systems approach'')of the functions and objectives of plant systems, components and structuresto determine maintenance activities and requirements;andbullet; Should provide clear and specific programmatic requirements thatcan be partically implemented to achieve high reliability;andbullet; Should be comprehensive in addressing the activities and functionsincluded in the proposed rule plus provisions for self assessment;andbullet; Should reference standards or guidelines such as those developedby ANS, ASME, IEEE, ASTM, INPO, or EPRI where practical to provide (a)specific programmatic requirements or (b) guidance for maintenance of specifictypes of equipment;andbullet; Should allow flexibility for adoption of new innovation technologiesas they are validated; andandbullet; Should provide for sufficient documentation so that program effectivenessand compliance with requirements of the standard can be evaluated.The Commission has conducted studies to review effective maintenance approachesand practices in other countries and industries and has documented thefindings in a draft NUREG series report.\3\<NOTE/> The Commission seeks comments on the draft NUREG report whichmay be submitted to the NRC as indicated under the <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> heading.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ A free single copy of draft NUREG-1333, ``MaintenanceApproaches and Practices in Selected Foreign Nuclear Power Programs andOther U.S. Industries: Review and Lessons Learned,'' to the extent of supply,may be obtained by writing to the Distribution Services Section, DocumentControl Branch, Division of Information and Support Services, U.S. NuclearRegulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. A copy is also available forinspection or copying for a fee in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 LStreet, Lower Level, NW., Washington, DC.The draft NUREG report concludes that the following are practices in foreigncountries and other U.S., industrial maintenance programs which have beenfound to contribute significantly to effective maintenance:1. Focus on long term maintenance objectives; establish a proactive maintenanceprogram as opposed to reactive maintenance;2. Use of a reliability centered approach to maintenance, including considerationof the man-machine interface;3. Collection and engineering evaluation of failure data (root cause analysis);4. Use of an integrated information system for collecting data and monitoringthe effectiveness of a maintenance program;5. Use of maintenance technician training/certification programs;6. Derive planning and scheduling from overall program objectives;7. Enhance environment/motivation of maintenance technicians (e.g. thrucross-training, ``Crew Chief'' concept); and8. Clearly define interfaces between maintenance and other activities (engineeringsupport, operations QA, QC, corporate offices, safety review).The Commission encourages in the development of any Maintenance Standardconsideration of the findings in the above referenced draft NUREG reportand any other pertiment studies on effective maintenance practices.The Commission also encourages the industry to consider incorporating appropriatemaintenance derived from plant aging studies in the Maintenance Standard.The Commission views maintenance rulemaking as an opportunity to encourage(a) good maintenance practices, (b) the adoption of common maintenancestandards, and (c) the development of valid quantitative measures of effectivenesswhich could become the bassis for regulation by outcomes rather than processes.The herein proposed rule addresses (a) and (b) but not (c). Follow-on rulemakingis envisioned which would build on the bases established in this rule andwould define those validated measurable quantities or indicators that couldcredibly become the basis for regulatory attention or action in the futureinstead of the systems for maintenance under (a) and (b) of this proposedrule.As noted above, an integral part of a good maintenance program is the monitoringand feedback of results. Programs should utilize quantitative measuresto monitor and adjust the maintenance program activities. Measures thatare based upon actual component reliability and failure history provideuseful indication of maintenance effectiveness. Such measures need a wellstructured and component oriented system: (e.g., the Nuclear Plant ReliabilityData System (NPRDS)) To capture and track equipment history data. The Commissionnotes and encourages the use of the industry-wide NPRDS for this purposein view of the multiple uses for the data.<ITAG tagnum="84">Certification of Plant Maintenance Programs</ITAG>The Commission wishes to encourage industry initiatives and responsibilityfor problem identification and resolution. Therefore, as a further wayof encouraging industry participation and responsibility, the Commissionis willing to consider a process of utilizing a designated third party,similar to the ASME code system, to review and certify licensee maintenanceprograms for conformance with the Maintenance Standard. This process, ifsuccessful, could alleviate the need for detailed NRC inspection of alllicensee maintenance programs. The Commission solicits proposals for conductingsuch a certification process. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments Requested </ITAG>In addition to comments on the content of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,the Commission specifically solicits input on the following: 1. Is it appropriate for the nuclear power industry to develop a MaintenanceStandard and, if so, would the industry develop such a Maintenance Standard?2. What level of detail should be included in the Maintenance Standard?3. Is two years a reasonable time to develop, and implement a standard?4. Is it appropriate for a designated third party to certify plant maintenanceprograms to comply with the Maintenance Standard; and, if so, would anorganization be willing to perform such certification? 5. The Commission plans to issue by November 1989, a Regulatory Guide establishingstandards and criteria for determining what constitutes an effective maintenanceprogram. This Regulatory Guide is being developed in parallel with thefinal rulemaking. The Commission encourages the industry to develop standardsand acceptance criteria. If an acceptable industry standard is availablein this time frame, the Commission will consider endorsing the industrystandard in the Regulatory Guide. An industry commitment to develop a maintenancestandard, consistent with the Commission's schedule to issue a final RegulatoryGuide by November 1989, would be necessary during this public comment period.6. The Commission believes that the proposed maintenance rule should beconsidered under 10 CFR 50.109(a)(4) of the backfit rule which would exemptthe maintenance rule from backfit requirements based on the precepts thateffective maintenance is necessary to assure adequate public protectionand that the proposed rule codifies and standardizes previously existingCommission requirements, both explicit and implicit, in plant technicalspecifications, licensee safety analysis reports, and 10 CFR Part 50, AppendixB. The Commission requests public comment concerning the need for a backfitanalysis for this rulemaking. 7. The Commission believes that the inclusion of balance of plant (BOP)equipment in the proposed maintenance rule is necessary and proper. However,the Commission also recognizes that some licensee maintenance programs,as presently configured, apply to structures, systems, and components thatare, without question, irrelevant to protection of public health and safetyfrom radiological hazards associated with the operation of the nuclearpower plant. The Commission requests public comment concerning what limitation,if any, should be placed on the final maintenance rule to provide somelicensee flexibility in this regard. 8. The Commission believes that individual worker accountability playsan important role in an effective maintenance program. The Commission is,therefore, soliciting comments on the means for incorporating this considerationinto a licensee's maintenance program. 9. The Commission desires to establish criteria within the maintenancerule which would form the basis for determining when a maintenance programis fully effective and additional improvement is not warranted from a safetystandpoint. Such criteria might be either quantitative or qualitative andcould be based on specific measurable attributes, on overall plant performance,on program results, or on other attributes. The Commission requests publiccomment concerning the need for such criteria, the form of such criteria,and the criteria themselves. 10. Are performance indicators that are being used by industry, may beused in the future, or have been used in the past, appropriate candidatesas quantitative measures of maintenance effectiveness? The Commission isparticularly interested in experience or analysis concerning indicatorsor the use of indicators of component reliability as maintenance performanceindicators. 11. Should an industry-wide component failure reporting system, e.g., NPRDS,be used by all plants in order to support the sharing of generic maintenanceexperience and facilitate monitoring of maintenance effectivenes? 12. Commissioner Roberts had the following views: <ITAG tagnum="21">I cannot join the majority in supporting the propoosed rulemakingon maintenance. In order to have the benefit of the public's comments,it has been my custom to agree to publication of proposed rulemakings.I cannot do so in this instance. I have asked one fundamental question.What are we trying to accomplish with this rule that cannot more effectivelyand innovatively be accomplished without a regulation? I have not receiveda satisfactory answer. I do not believe the case has been made that licenseesdo not have established maintenance programs. Most importantly to me, therehas been no demonstration that this rule would improve implementation ofexisting programs. Neither have I been provided with compelling documentationon what the problem is and how, specifically, this rule will fix it. Onthe contrary, the trends staff has provided show continued improvementin the maintenance area.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed rule the Commission is now publishing fails to providea basis for determining when a maintenance program is effective or whenimprovements are ``appropriate.'' We are even delaying publication of theaccompanying Regulatory Guide until the final rule. Without being affordedthe opportunity to review this <T3>implementation</T3> document, the Commission is left in the positionof approving a specious rule. It is no wonder that this rulemaking wouldelicit such widespread opposition. The public is being asked to commenton a rule of form but no substance. I believe it would be more productiveto delay issuance of this proposed rule until the draft regulatory guideis available for comment. Only then can we receive meaningful commentson the rulemaking package. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I am concerned that this rule goes beyond our authority. I cannotagree with a rule that would have the NRC regulating maintenance on allsystems, structures and components regardless of whether they have a nexusto radiological safety or not. I am troubled by the attitude demonstratedwhen we request public comments on what limitations, if any, should beplaced on the final rule to address structures, systems and componentsthat are ``<T3>without question irrelevant</T3> (my emphasis) to the protection ofpublic health and safety.'' This clearly abdicates our responsibility toshow that a regulation is needed. We must ask ourselves: are we proceedingwith this rulemaking for the sake of the rule itself? As attested to bythe cases where the Commission cited licensees, the NRC already has theauthority to enforce compliance in the maintenance area. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The arguments advanced by both the staff and the Commission in tryingto comply with the requirements of the backfit rule have played a significantrole in my decision not to support this proposed rulemaking. The staffargument for the rule's compliance with andSection; 50.109 has been madeon the basis of cost. The staff states that the backfit analysis showsthat `` * * * the rule will provide a substantial increase in the protectionof the public health and safety without any additional cost.'' I am skepticalof the assumptions made in the backfit and regulatory analysis and requestcomments on both these documents. I also request comments on the viewsof the ACRS. They state that `` * * * there are characteristics of regulations,and especially the way in which they are typically enforced, that leadus to believe that, under a rule, a move toward uniformity would occur,and this is likely to decrease the effectiveness of some of the betterexisting programs.'' I share their concern that the existence of this rulecould make things worse and diminish rather than enhance the protectionof the public. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Regarding ``adequate protection,'' the Commission appears to be sayingthat since effective maintenance is necessary to maintain adequate protection,this rule should be excepted under andSection; 50.109(a)(4). This exemptionwould prohibit staff from taking implementation costs into consideration.However, it would require that a documented evaluation be prepared forpublic comment. Therefore, my opposition to the exception is not to theexception itself but to the precedential nature of the use of the adequateprotection argument. Let me state that I too strongly believe that effectivemaintenance is necessary to assure that nuclear power plants are safe andto provide adequate protection to the public. I also believe, just as strongly,that <T3>this rule is not necessary to provide that protection,</T3> and thatas the ACRS noted it may well have the opposite effect. I believe thatwe cannot afford to be careless about the use of the ``adequate protection''argument for exception to the backfit rule. The Commission is in litigationabout this very issue. The Commission addressed this point in detail underthe heading ``Adequate Protection'' in the <T3>Response to Comments</T3> on the final 10 CFR Part 50 <T3>Revision of Backfit Process for Power Reactors.</T3> Let us rememberthat there had been concerns that in dealing with the backfit rule, theCommission would use the phrase ``adequate protection'' arbitrarily. TheCommission could unwittingly be giving credence to that view. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Additionally, it seems to me that the Commission position on adequateprotection is internally inconsistent. The Commission needs to recognizethat when it states that this rule is needed to maintain adequate protection,it is saying that the current operating plants now pose undue risk to thepublic which we are presently tolerating. If I believe that, I would suggest(as I'm sure would the rest of the Commission) that this rule become immediatelyeffective. This is clearly not the case. As the Commission in the verysame comment shows, `` * * * the proposed rule codifies and standardizes<T3>previously existing</T3> (my emphasis) Commission requirements, bothexplicit and implicit, in plant technical specifications, licensee safetyanalysis reports, and 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B.'' It seems to me thatthe Commission can't have it both ways. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I request comments on my views. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Impact </ITAG>Although the Commission believes that this proposed rule is by virtue of10 CFR 50.109(a)(4) not subject to the requirement for a backfit findingand analysis, it has nevertheless performed an analysis of cost and otherbackfit factors as an alternative ground for proceeding with the proposedrule and to facilitate public comment on the backfit issue. The economic impact of the proposed requirement on licensees should benegligible. The accompanying draft regulatory analysis shows that, althoughinitial financial investments will be required by some licensees to establisha systematic and comprehensive maintenance program, the savings due todecreased corrective maintenance costs and increased plant availabilityshould outweigh the investment costs. The Commission requests cooperationof informed sources in order to develop further details and verificationof this analysis. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability </ITAG>The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 10CFR Part 51, this rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal actionsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment and; therefore,an environmental impact statement is not required. The proposed action is directed to preserve and promptly restore operability,reliability, and availability of, or to prevent the failure of, plant structures,systems, and components whose failure could threaten the health and safetyof the public. Since the proposed action is directed to improving the maintenanceof plant systems, components and structures and does not require any modificationof the plant, it will not affect the quality of the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no signficiant impact on whichthis determination is based are available for inspection at the NRC PublicDocument Room 2120 L Street, Lower level, NW., Washington, DC. Single copies of the environmental assessment and finding of no significantimpact are available from Moni Dey, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research,Telephone: (301) 492-3730, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington,DC 20555. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act Statement </ITAG>This proposed rule amends recordkeeping requirements that are subject tothe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>) This rule has been submitted to the Office of Managementand Budget for review and approval of the paperwork requirements. Public reporting burden for this recordkeeping of information is estimatedto average 1000 hours per plant per year including the time for reviewinginstructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintainingthe data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to the Records and Reports Management Branch, Division of Information SupportServices/IRM, Office of Administration and Resources Management, U.S. NuclearRegulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Analysis </ITAG>The Commission has prepared a draft regulatory analysis on this proposedregulation. The analysis examines the costs and benefits of the alternativesconsidered by the Commission. The draft analysis is available for inspectionin the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L St., NW, Washington, DC 20005.Single copies of the draft analysis may be obtained from Moni Dey, U.S.Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, (301) 492-3730. The Commission requests public comment on the draft regulatory analysis.Comments on the draft analysis may be submitted to the NRC as indicatedunder the <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>heading. <ITAG tagnum="84">Backfit Analysis </ITAG>As noted above, the Commission has completed a backfit analysis for theproposed rule. The Commission has determined, based on this analysis, thatbackfitting to comply with the requirements of this proposed rule willprovide a substantial increase in protection to public health and safetywithout any additional costs. The backfit analysis on which this determinationis based is as follows: <T3>Analysis and Documentation for the Proposition That the Proposed RuleSatisfies the ``Adequate Protection'' Exception in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(4);Analysis and Determination That the Rulemaking to Amend 10 CFR 50 ConcerningMaintenance Complies With Backfit Rule 10 CFR 50.109 In Any Event </T3>While the Commission's existing regulations contain several provisionswhich, either implicitly or explicitly, address the need for effectivemaintenance, they do not <T3>explicitly </T3>address the requirements of an effective maintenanceprogram in any easily understood and comprehensive fashion. The Commissionbelieves that safety can and must be enhanced by improving the effectivenessof maintenance programs throughout the nuclear industry. The proposed rulerequires nuclear power plant maintenance programs to have a set of functionsand activities which the Commission believes are essential for a comprehensiveand effective program. The findings and conclusions of the Commission's assessment of the effectivenessof plant maintenance programs can be found in NUREG-1212, ``Status of Maintenancein the U.S. Nuclear Power Industry.'' The study showed weaknesses at plantsin a number of areas of maintenance which the Commission believes is criticalfor an overall effective program. Further, analysis of operational eventshas shown that, in some cases, nuclear power plant equipment is not beingmaintained with a high degree of reliability that the equipment will performits intended function when required. The Commission believes that effectivemaintenance is necessary for adequate protection. The objective of theproposed rule is to require improvements for those plants that are poorlymaintained, and also to prevent the declining performance of plants thatare well-maintained. The proposed rule, by addressing in an easily understoodway the requirement that there be an effective maintenance program, wouldadvance the goal of having a comprehensive set of regulations which definewhat is needed for adequate protection and; therefore, satisfies the ``AdequateProtection'' Exception in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(4). In addition, the Commission has conducted an analysis and determined thatthe proposed maintenance rule complies with section (3) of the backfitrule, 10 CFR 50.109. The benefit of improvements in maintenance has beenestimated to be in the order of 250,000 person-rem for the lifetime ofall nuclear power plants. Common sense also suggests that a well-maintainedplant poses less risk than one poorly maintained. The proposed rule willhelp ensure a satisfactory level of performance for maintenance programsby specifying those activities and practices which, through experience,have been shown to be key elements of effective maintenance programs, andshould result in a substantial enhancement of public health and safety.Improvements in maintenance serve to meet dual objectives: (1) Enhancesafety; and also (2) increase plant availability and capacity factor. Therefore,it has been estimated that enhancement in safety as a result of improvedmaintenance may be accomplished without any additional costs, due to costsavings from reduced plant downtime. Further, a proactive and well-plannedmaintenance program decreases costs of corrective and repeat maintenance.The following discussion presents the summary of the backfit analysis.Further details may be found in the Regulatory Analysis for the proposedrule. <ITAG tagnum="81">Analysis of andSection;50.109(c) Factors </ITAG>1. Statement of the specific objectives that the backfit is designed toachieve. The purpose of the maintenance rule is to improve maintenance effectiveness,and thereby enhance overall safety, by establishing basic requirementsfor plant maintenance programs. In establishing these requirements, theCommission intends to consider the industry-wide efforts that have alreadybeen initiated.The objectives of the maintenance rule are as follows:(1) To define NRC's expectations for plant maintenance; and(2) To improve licensee maintenance programs by requiring the effectiveconduct of a set of functions and activities.With implementation of the rule, it is expected that the current wide variationin maintenance performance will be reduced so that the performance of plantsthat lag behind the industry as a whole will be brought up to the levelof performance of the majority of the industry. Second, the overall averagelevel of industry's performance should also improve.An important part of the structure of the rule is to achieve improved maintenanceperformance in a way that allows licensees the flexibility to determinethe details of their individual maintenance program so that plant-specificfactors can be taken into account. This flexible approach will enhanceboth safety and cost-effectiveness, compared to a rigid and prescriptiverulemaking approach.2. General description of the activity required by the licensee or applicantin order to complete the backfit.The licensees will be required to have a documented and effective maintenanceprogram which shall include the following activities:(1) Technology in the areas of:(i) Corrective maintenance,(ii) Preventive maintenance,(iii) Predictive maintenance, and(iv) Maintenance Surveillance;(2) Engineering in support of maintenance;(3) Quality assurance and quality control of maintenance activities;(4) Incorporation of plant modifications into the maintenance program;(5) Equipment history and trending;(6) Maintenance record keeping;(7) Management of parts, tools, and facilities;(8) Maintenance procedures;(9) Post-Maintenance testing and return-to-service activities;(10) Measures of overall maintenance program effectiveness;(11) Maintenance management and organization in the areas of:(i) Planning,(ii) Scheduling,(iii) Staffing,(iv) Shift coverage, and(v) Resource allocation;(12) Control of contracted maintenance services;(13) Radiological exposure control (including ALARA) during maintenanceactivities;(14) Maintenance personnel qualification and training;(15) Internal communications between the maintenance organization and plantoperations and support groups;(16) Communications between plant and corporate management and the maintenanceorganization; and(17) Consideration of maintenance recommendations or requirements of individualvendors.Criteria for acceptability of the conduct of the above activities willbe provided in the proposed Maintenance Standard or Regulatory Guide.3. Potential change in the risk to the public from the accidental offsiterelease of radioactive material.Implementation of the proposed maintenance rule will result in an estimatedtotal risk reduction to the public ranging from 50,000 to 500,000 person-remwith a point estimate of about 250,000 person-rem.4. Potential impact on radiological exposure of facility employees. A largefraction (two thirds to three fourths) of the occupational radiation exposureincurred at nuclear power plants is associated with maintenance, on theorder of 300 person-rem per reactor-year in 1987. Improvements in maintenanceprograms can affect collective occupational exposures both positively andnegatively. Increases in maintenance activity due to expanded preventivemaintenance or more aggressive corrective maintenance (to reduce backlogs,for example) will tend to increase exposure, and productivity and reductionsin the amount of rework will tend to reduce exposures. The net effect ofthese positive and negative trends is believed to be beneficial, but smallcompared to the other costs and benefits of improved maintenace.5. Installation and continuing costs associated with backfit, includingthe cost of facility downtime or the cost of construction delay.For 100 operating reactors, the total estimated cost associated with theproposed maintenance rule is ^$198 million.

The potential safety impact of changes in plant or operational complexity,including the relationship to proposed and existing regulatory requirements.The proposed rule would require certain elements in a plant maintenanceprogram and should not add to plant or operational complexity. Improvedmaintenance should result in a decrease of challenges to safety systemsand forced outages, and therefore, should decrease the complexity of operations.The proposed maintenance rule is related to the following existing regulatoryrequirements: (1) Surveillance requirements for safety system is required in the technicalspecifications. These requirements are not duplicated for the proposedmaintenance rule. (2) In-service inspection requirements are covered under 10 CFR 50.55a,Codes and Standards. These requirements of a preventive maintenance programare not duplicated under the proposed maintenance rule. (3) Criterion 1, Appendix A, 10 CFR Part 50, concerning General DesignCriteria (GDC), requires that a quality assurance (QA) program be establishedand implemented in order to provide adequate assurance that Nuclear PowerPlant (NPP) structures, systems, and components will satisfactorily performtheir safety functions. Appendix B of 10 CFR Part 50 establishes QA requirementsfor the design, construction, and operation of those structures, systems,and components that prevent or mitigate the consequences of postulatedaccidents that could cause undue risk to the health and safety of the public.Regulatory Guide 1.33 has been promulgated to describe acceptable methodsfor complying with the provisions of these appendices of 10 CFR Part 50for the operational phase of NPPs. These requirements are directed towards maintaining a quality assuranceprogram and do not explicitly address maintenance as defined in the proposedrule. The proposed Maintenance Standard and Regulatory Guide will directlyaddress the maintenance activities in the proposed rule. 7. The estimated resource burden on the NRC associated with the backfitand the availability of such resources. The estimated total cost for NRC review of industry submittals requiredby the proposed maintenance rule in $400,000 based on the need for developinga Regulatory Guide to provide the basis for review of an industry-developedMaintenance Standard or to provide guidance on implementation of the ruleif a Maintenance Standard is not developed. Individual plant maintenanceprograms will be subject to the ongoing inspection process but would notbe required to be submitted to the NRC for review and approval. 8. The potential impact of difference in facility type design, or age onthe relevancy and practicality of the backfit. The proposed maintenance rule establishes generic requirements applicableto all types of facilities and designs, regardless of their age. 9. Whether the backfit is interim or final and, if interim, the justificationfor imposing the backfit on an interim basis. The proposed maintenancerule would be a final requirement. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Certification </ITAG>In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b),the Commission hereby certifies that this proposed regulation will not,if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.
