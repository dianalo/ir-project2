This is the first acquisition by Leonard Green andamp; Partners,a merchant banking firm specializing in leveraged buy-outsthat was founded late last year by Leonard Green, formerly apartner of New York-based Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen Ltd.Leveraged buy-out activity in general has dropped since lastyear's collapse of the junk-bond market.</LP><TEXT>   A spokeswoman for Leonard Green andamp; Partners said theacquisition of Carr-Gottenstein, which should be completed inthe fall, wouldn't involve junk bonds. She wouldn't elaborateon the nature of the financing.   Mr. Green, who was credited with much of the success thatGibbons, Green had with arranging LBOs in the 1980s, said heleft that firm because of &quot;philosophical differences&quot; withhis partners. Since setting up his own shop, he has beenstruggling to match his prior track record; he has said hisgoal is to complete between six and nine buy-outs, valued at$100 million to $500 million each, in the next three years.   Carr-Gottstein includes Carr's food and drug stores, theJ.B. Gottstein Co. wholesaling operation, the Oaken Kegliquor stores, several shopping centers in Anchorage, EagleRiver, and Fairbanks and several other distribution-relatedconcerns.
