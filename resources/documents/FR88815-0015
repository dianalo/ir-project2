Certain vehicles areexcluded by section S3 from the standard's applicability because they haveunusual physical or operational characteristics that result in restrictedhighway operation (e.g., low speed, permit requirements, daytime operation)which limits hazards and the possibility of accidents. Also, the unusualconfigurations and low production volumes of these vehicles sharply increasecompliance costs.On January 21, 1988, NHTSA published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 1643) a notice of proposed rulemaking(NPRM) to eliminate from Standard No. 121 a provision which excludes vehiclesthat have an overall vehicle width of more than 102 inches. The noticewas issued in response to a petition for rulemaking submitted by CorpacIndustries, Inc.Corpac stated in its petition that the Surface Transportation AssistanceAct of 1982 prevents states from establishing a maximum width of more thanor less than 102 inches for commercial motor vehicles operating on theNational Network and that this was subsequently interpreted by the FederalHighway Administration as including its approximate metric equivalent,i.e., 2.6 meters (102.36 inches). The petitioner submitted informationshowing that thousands of trailers are now being produced which are 102.36inches wide. Corpac argued that Standard No. 121 does not technically applyto these vehicles and urged that the 102-inch exclusion be eliminated toprevent the production of vehicles with possibly markedly inferior brakingperformance.NHTSA noted in the January 1988 NPRM that one issue raised by Corpac'spetition was whether new 102.36-inch trailers are excluded from StandardNo. 121 by virtue of the provision, set forth in section S3(a), that excludesvehicles that have ``an overall vehicle width of more than 102 inches withextendable equipment in the fully retracted position.'' The agency concludedthat these vehicles are not excluded from Standard No. 121.Section 416(a) of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 statesthat ``(n)o state, other than the State of Hawaii, shall establish, maintain,or enforce any regulation of commerce which imposes a width limitationof <T3>more or less than 102 inches</T3> on any segment of the National Systemof Interstate and Defense Highways, or any other qualifying Federal-aidhighway as designated by the Secretary of Transportation, with trafficlanes designed to be a width of twelve feet or more * * * '' (Emphasisadded.) Thus, a state may not prohibit vehicles with a width of 102 inchesor less, or permit vehicles with a width greater than 102 inches, on thesehighways. (States are permitted under section 416(b) to grant special usepermits to vehicles that exceed 102 inches in width.)In proposing regulations under the statute, the Federal Highway Administration(FHWA) stated the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">The American National Metric Council and the Truck Trailer ManufacturersAssociation have called attention to the practices of some Canadian trailermanufacturers to construct their trailers 2.6 meters wide. This dimensionis equivalent to 102.36 inches. The FHWA is interested in knowing the advantagesand disadvantages of allowing trailers of 102.36-inch widths on the roadsas perceived by the State and the public, in general. The FHWA solicitscomments on the question of allowing 102.36-inch wide trailers on the NationalNetwork. 48 FR 41280, September 14, 1983.</ITAG>In issuing a final rule, the FHWA stated;<ITAG tagnum="21">Commenters on the subject of recognizing the approximate metric widthequivalent of 2.6 meters (102.36 inches), on trailers were strongly infavor of such a position. Standardization of truck width on an internationalbasis is seen as an important objective, which will serve to enhance internationaltrade. The FHWA concurs in that assessment. The final rule as containedin Section 658.15 establishes the maximum width as 102 inches or its approximatemetric equivalent of 2.6 meters. The FHWA believes the States can accommodatethe rule without changing laws or violating congressional intent. 49 FR23312, June 5, 1984.</ITAG>The FHWA regulation, set forth at 23 CFR andSection; 685.15, states:<ITAG tagnum="21">No State shall impose a width limitation of more or less than 102inches, or its approximate metric equivalent, 2.6 meters (102.36 inches)on a vehicle operating on the National Network, except for the State ofHawaii * * *</ITAG>Thus, 102.36 inches is defined in the FHWA regulation as the ``approximatemetric equivalent'' of 102 inches, and was determined by FHWA as beingconsistent with Congressional intent as not being ``more or less'' than102 inches. Particularly given this background, it is NHTSA's opinion thatthe 102.36 inch trailers being produced in light of the FHWA regulationare not considered to have a width of ``more than 102 inches'' within themeaning of Standard No. 121's applicability section. Also, previous <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices make it clear that NHTSA did not intendthe criteria in section S3 to exclude typical configuration vehicles fromStandard No. 121. For example, in establishing the 102-inch width exclusion,the agency stated that, in all states other than Hawaii, vehicles exceedingthis width were allowed to operate on the highway only by permit. See 42FR 42208, August 22, 1977.NHTSA stated in the January 1988 NPRM that while it is the agency's opinionthat the 102.36-inch vehicles are not excluded from Standard No. 121, itagreed that it should clarify the applicability of the standard to thosevehicles. The agency stated that while such clarification could be achievedthrough amending S3(a) to expressly refer to the 102.36-inch trailers,it believed that a better approach would be to eliminate the exclusionaltogether. The agency tentatively concluded that it was not necessaryto retain the width exlcusion. NHTSA stated that it was unaware of anyvehicles wider than 102 inches or 102.36 inches that do not come withinone of the section S3's other exclusions, and that it believed that thoseexclusions are sufficiently comprehensive to continue to exclude all vehicleswhose function or construction result in restricted highway operation andfor which compliance would be very difficult. The agency accordingly proposedto delete section S3's width exclusion.NHTSA received four comments on the January 1988 NPRM. General Motors statedthat it supports the proposed amendment to eliminate the exclusion basedon vehicle width on the basis that the other criteria stated in sectionS3 are sufficiently comprehensive to exclude the vehicles that should beexcluded from the applicability of Standard No. 121. The Insurance Institutefor Highway Safety also supported the proposal, stating that any exclusionfrom a Federal motor vehicle safety standard should be limited to specificand unusual circumstances. A comment supporting the proposal was also submittedby Corpac.The Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association (TTMA) commented that if thewidth exclusion is eliminated from Standard No. 121, a new exclusion shouldbe added. That commenter stated that the elimination of the width exclusionwould make some trailers with trunnion or dual oscillating suspension/axleassemblies subject to the standard. According to TTMA, these trailers havea unique undercarriage in that there are two short track axles across thetrailer's width instead of one, and do not have sufficient space for brakesthat can meet Standard No. 121. That commenter stated that this constructionresults in a trailer which is typically 120 inches wide, but that sometrailers may expand to 120 inches in width when loaded but are less than102 inches wide when empty. According to TTMA, these trailers often travelat highway speeds when used on the road, but under permit due to theirwidth. That commenter stated that while most of these trailers are excludedfrom Standard No. 121 by having a gross axle weight rating greater than29,000 pounds, some of the trailers are excluded only because they havea width greater than 2.6 meters (102.36 inches). TTMA recommended thata new exclusion be added for any trailer equipped with two short trackaxles in a line across the width of the trailer.After considering the comments, NHTSA has declined to eliminate StandardNo. 121's width exclusion, except for trailers that have a width of morethan 102.36 inches with extendable equipment in the fully retracted positionand are equipped with two short track axles in a line across the widthof trailer. NHTSA has concluded that the trailers with trunnion or dualoscillating suspension/axle assemblies identified by TTMA are vehicleswhose function or construction result in restricted highway operation andfor which compliance would be very difficult. The agency indicated in theNPRM that it did not intend to extend the applicability of Standard No.121 to such vehicles. NHTSA is retaining a width provision in the revisedexclusion to make it clear that it does not exclude any vehicles not previouslyexcluded by the old width exclusion.The effective date is 30 days after publication of a final rule in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>. NHTSA has determined that there is a good causefor an effective date within that time period since the amendment clarifiesthe standard's applicability and is not believed to affect the applicabilityof the standard to any vehicles currently being produced.The agency has analyzed the economic and other effects of this amendmentand determined that it is neither ``major'' within the meaning of ExecutiveOrder 12291 nor ``significant'' within the meaning of the Department ofTransportation's regulatory policies and procedures. As indicated above,the amendment clarifies Standard No. 121's applicability to vehicles of102.36 inches and is not believed to affect the applicability of the standardto any vehicles currently being produced. The agency has also determinedthat the effects of the amendment are so minimal that a full regulatoryevaluation is not required.In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, NHTSA has evaluatedthe effects of this action on small entities. I certify that the amendmentwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. For the reasons stated in the preceding paragraph, neithersmall businesses, small organizations, nor small governmental units willbe affected by the amendment.The agency has analyzed this rule for the purposes of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act, and determined that it will not have any significant impacton the quality of the human environment.Finally, this rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principlesand criteria contained in Executive Order 12612. The agency has determinedthat the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrantthe preparation of a Federalism Assessment.A regulatory information number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory actionlisted in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations. The Regulatory InformationService Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of eachyear. The RIN number contained in the heading of this document can be usedto cross reference this action with the Unified Agenda.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 571</ITAG>Imports, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles, Rubber and rubber products,Tires.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 571_[AMENDED]</ITAG>In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR Part 571 is amended as follows:1.
