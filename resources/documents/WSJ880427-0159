One of the latest battles is over British Airways, which is expected this year to select replacements for its 11 aging Lockheed Corp. L-1011 wide-bodied jets.    McDonnell Douglas wants British Airways to buy its newest wide-bodied model, the MD-11. The U.S. company's hopes were raised as British Airways inherited an order for three MD-11s (and options for a further six) when it acquired British Caledonian Airways earlier this year.    The four-nation Airbus consortium, however, very much wants British Airways to order its newest model, the A-340. British Airways has been remarkably resistant to Airbus sales efforts for 17 years, but it also inherited British Caledonian's order for 10 short-range A-320s, and its executives are said to be impressed with the first of the 150-seaters delivered. Airbus hopes the addition of the A-320s to the British Airways fleet will clear the way for more A-320 orders and for the purchase of the long-range, four-engine A-340s.    The MD-11 and the A-340 cost about $80 million each.    Other sales contests are shaping up in this category of long-range, wide-bodied planes that are smaller than Boeing Co.'s 747. Delta Air Lines wants to replace 13 L-1011s in use on Pacific and European routes and is looking at A-340s, MD-11s and Boeing 747s.    Cathay Pacific Airways will replace its L-1011 fleet with some 747s and the rest either with Boeing 767s, MD-11s or one or the other of Airbus's sister A-330s or A-340s. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines; United Airlines, which is a unit of Allegis Corp.; and American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., also are on the list for replacements in this class of wide-bodied, three-engine jets.    Despite these contests, the cooperation talks in Toulouse, France, between McDonnell Douglas and Airbus continue with an eye toward a solution that wouldn't jeopardize sales of either side's existing product range. One of the ideas under discussion is a union of the MD-11 fuselage with A-330 wings, a sort of hybrid jumbo that could compete with the Boeing 747. &quot;Sales is an area where we agree to disagree,&quot; says an Airbus spokesman.    So the rivalry between the MD-11 and the A-340 rages on, with both sides claiming that the other is padding its order book. Meantime, the two companies have to guard against the third candidate, Boeing's 767 model. British Airways and Delta both operate 767s or have them on order. The 260-seat twin-jet is cheaper to operate and yet has wide-body comfort and long-range capacity. </TEXT></DOC>
