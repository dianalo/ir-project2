The paper gives abrief resume of the design and manufacture of such lenses but concentrateson the final testing and performance. A critical discussion is givenon the effect of surface imperfection on the quasi-far field performanceof the lens and compares this with an assessment of the lens based onits focal properties.</TEXT></DOC>
