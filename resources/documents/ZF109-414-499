DESIGNED WITH NETWORKS IN MINDandM;Microsoft Corp. Tuesday announced the immediate, worldwide availability ofthe Microsoft Windows graphical environment ver- sion 3.0.andM;A dramatically enhanced version of Microsoft's graphical-user in- terface forMS-DOS- and PC-DOS-based personal computers, the ver- sion 3.0 transforms anordinary, character-based PC into a power- ful, graphical machine.andP;  MicrosoftWindows environment was developed with a one-megabyte personal computer as adesign point, the standard minimum entry system for PCs today -- thereby ena-bling 30 million of the 50 million current MS-DOS users to quickly and easilyadd a graphical-user interface to their MS-DOS machines.andM;Version 3.0 offers dramatic performance increases for Windows ap- plications,advances in ease of use and aesthetic appeal, and straightforward integrationinto corporate computing environments.andM;Windows 3.0 is part of Microsoft's family of operating systems.andP;  The Windowsgraphical user interface has been made more attractive and appealing inversion 3.0 with the use of a proportionally spaced system font, 3-D scrollbars and command buttons and color- ful icons.andP;  The interface is similar tothat of Microsoft OS/2 (see footnote a) Presentation Manager, providingconsistency in com- panies that support both environments.andP;  Windowsapplications automatically take advantage of the improvements to the user in-terface.andM;USER SHELL andamp; POLISHED APPEARANCE MAKE WINDOWS EASY TO USE The user shell, aspecial-purpose application provided with Win- dows, shields the users fromthe complexity of MS-DOS commands and provides the tools and resources neededto manage applications and files without leaving Windows.andP;  This makes iteasier for users to navigate through their computer environments.andP;  TheProgram Manager, a component of the shell, is the user's first view of theWindows environment.andP;  It presents Windows applications and systems functionsas colorful icons that users can rearrange in groups that are most intuitiveto them, allowing users to customize their desktops.andP;  Traditional MS-DOSapplications can also be run from icons in the new Windows shell.andM;The File Manager, a second component of the shell, allows users to easily andquickly manipulate and locate their files, and drop and drag files to andfrom any disk drive including a server.andP;  It uses a directory-tree format todisplay file names and file details.andM;New options in the Control Panel, the third shell component, take advantageof version 3.0's ability to exploit more advanced color hardware and letusers design their own &quot;look.&quot; For instance, users can scan pictures ordrawings for their own screen back- ground or choose from a set of availablebackgrounds called wallpapers, and can also choose their own screen colors.andO;Windows version 3.0's new shell integrates into its menus the ability toeasily and consistently connect and disconnect to network servers.andM;IMPROVED MEMORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE Because of a newmemory management system implemented in version 3.0, Windows applications runmarkedly faster, and users can keep multiple large applications open andaccessible.andP;  By taking ad- vantage of the protected mode capabilities of theIntel 286 and 386 microprocessors, version 3.0 breaks the 640K DOS memorybar- rier.andP;  Now Windows applications can exploit up to 16MB of memory.andP;  Onsystems with 386 processors, Windows can exploit the virtual protected-modecapabilities and provide up to 48MB of memory to Windows applications.andP;  Thismemory management is done automati- cally for Windows applications.andM;DESKTOP ACCESSORIES OFFER INSTANT FUNCTION The Windows environment version3.0 ships with a variety of desktop applications such as CardFile and WindowsWrite, an execu- tive word processor.andP;  Many of these applications have beenenhanced in version 3.0.andP;  New desktop applications include Re- corder, asimple macro that records keystrokes and mouse movements and plays them back;Solitaire, an electronic version of the popular card game; and a full-colorpainting program.andM;With every retail copy of Microsoft Windows version 3.0, users will receivefor a limited time a promotional copy of DayBook, which is a sample ToolBookapplication from Asymetrix Corp.
