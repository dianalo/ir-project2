It consists of pretreating the carbon with acetoneand water then removing the acetone and water, drying the carbon, and proceedingto fabricate the porous carbon cathode as usual. The research and developmentof this method has been completed and successfully demonstrated.Under the authority of section 11 (a) (2) of the Federal Technology TransferAct of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-502) and section 207 of title 35, United StatesCode, the Department of the Army as represented by USAETandamp;DL wishesto exclusively license rights to this method to a party interested in usingit in the manufacture of batteries.<ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Dr. Michael Binder, US Army ElectronicsTechnology and Devices Laboratory, ATTN: SLCET-PR, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5000;(201) 544-4795.<ITAG tagnum="6">John O.
