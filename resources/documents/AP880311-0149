When Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to Washington tosign an arms treaty in December, he brought 35 ounces of Russianblack caviar for President Reagan, worth $875.   From West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Reagan received a $300case of German wine; from Canadian Governor General Jeanne Suave, a$10 bottle of maple syrup; and from King Hassan of Morocco, ``alarge basket of delicacies and foodstuffs'' with a price tag of$100.   First lady Nancy Reagan was given two enlarged photogrphs, takenby a French satellite, of the Reagans' ranch in California's SantaYnez mountains. That and other gifts came from French PrimeMinister Jacques Chirac. Value: $1,500.   Among other gifts from foreign officials, which were listed bythe State Department in Friday's Federal Register, was an AK-47automatic rifle, ``with separate box of ammunition,'' given toformer Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger by Chinese Gen. YangShangkun.   Secretary of State George Shultz's wife, Helena, was given a $20``horse tail fly whisk'' by women from the Cameroon People'sDemocratic Movement.   And Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who is being pressured by theUnited States to step down as Panama's military ruler, sent a dozenbottles of champagne worth $285 to the U.S. Army Southern Commandat Fort Clayton, Panama, last July 4.   Edible gifts, like the syrup and the caviar, can be consumed bythe recipients. Less expensive items also can be kept, but federallaw requires that anything worth more than $180 be turned over tothe government to go into a museum or to be auctioned off. In manycases, the gifts can be retained ``for official use'' in theoffices of the recipient.   In each case, the gifts were accepted because ``refusal wouldhave caused embarrassment to donor and U.S. government,'' the StateDepartment said.   The Reagans received a total of $81,178 in presents, the mostexpensive of which was a $12,600 crystal bowl and platter fromSwedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson.   Knowing of Mrs. Reagan's fondness for smart clothes, Semra Ozal,wife of the Turkish prime miniser, gave the first lady a brownleather dress with black velvet and gold bead decorations, amatching fur-trimmed leather jacket and a black leather eveningsuit, also trimmed with fur. The outfits were valued at $700.   The prime minister, Turgut Ozal, gave the president a pair ofcarved-wood walking sticks decorated with silver-colored metal andbearing pictures of the Reagans. They were valued at $120.   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir gave the Reagans acalligraphic sculpture forming the Hebrew letters resh and nun,which spell the word ``Ron'' phonetically and also stand for theHebrew characters for ``Ronald'' and ``Nancy.'' It was worth anestimated $750.   Many of the gifts were in some way identified with the donornation. African countries tended to give handmade craft items,Middle Eastern countries often gave rugs, and some foreign leadersgave pictures of themselves.   At least one gift couldn't be appraised. Reagan was given astone launched by the Romans in the first-century seige of Masada,in southern Israel, which Israeli President Chaim Herzog hadencased in lucite and mounted on black marble.
