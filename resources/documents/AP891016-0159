It was the second day of parliamentary debate on a plan tomodify the system of pegging wage raises to price increases. Thesystem was devised during round-table talks last spring betweencommunist authorities and the then-opposition to offset the worsteffects of the shift to a market economy.   The Solidarity-led government said some limit was needed toreign in rocketing inflation. It estimated that the specialprovision for covering food prices would cost more than $833million.   The National Bank meanwhile devalued the zloty Monday for the12th time this year from the previous rate of 1,791 zlotys to thedollar to 2,100 zlotys to the dollar _ or 17.2 percent _ as effortsto align the official rate and a higher commercial rate continued.   Parliament endorsed the limited indexation plan by a lukewarmvote of 188 in favor, 27 against and 133 abstaining.   Members of the Democratic Party, one of the two minor partiesthat shifted from the communist bloc to form a majority coalitionwith Solidarity, abstained.   Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz told state TV he wassatisfied.   ``However, incomes will still grow at a high rate,'' he said.``Next year we will have to take more decisive steps to slow theinflationary growth of incomes.''   Since food price controls were lifted on Aug. 1, the last act ofthe communist-led government, prices of items such as butter haveincreased 1,000 percent and meat prices have gone up sevenfold.   But the East bloc's first non-communist government is faced withreducing a huge budget defict and curbing raging inflation thataccelerated in August to a 600 percent annual rate.   ``Full compensation of food price increases until the end of theyear would surely make society's situation easier ... From thepoint of view of the budget, however, the situation is serious,''said Labor Minister Jacek Kuron, the veteran Solidarity activist incharge of indexation.   Experts say the 1989 budget deficit could could total $5.3billion without radical controls.   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's cabinet studied suchmeasures during weekend meetings _ a 15-month moratorium onstarting major new government-funded projects; a massive shift ofmilitary food, medicine and industrial capacity to the civilianside, and ending subsidies to some mines and food enterprises.   But the government said the most important step was revisingindexation rules.   The initial plan raised all wages by 80 percent of the increaseof the cost of living from July to December, regardless of raisesalready received.   The government revision provides for raises covering 100 percentof the price increases, less raises already awarded, retroactivelyfor the third quarter of the year, and covering 80 percent of theincrease for the last three months.   Because most workers have received substantial raises asmanagers struggled to keep up with inflation, the revised proposalmeans a much more modest indexation program overall.   The higher cost alternative, proposed by some Solidarity unionrepresentatives, would have compensated 100 percent of the increasein food prices, a popular idea among price-shocked Poles.   Sejm Deputy Jan Krol of the Solidarity delegation toldParliament it must be understood that the transition to a marketeconomy will result in some people having higher incomes thanothers, and that the costs of reform cannot be spread evenly.   ``The safeguarding of minimal living standards means that nobodyin Poland, as a result of reforms ... should suffer hunger,'' hesaid.   ``However, a reimbursement of the cost of living, as a result ofindexation ... at 100 percent, is out of the question, and thesociety should not be presented with such illusions,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
