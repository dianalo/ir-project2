Pendleton Jr., the U.S. Civil RightsCommission chairman who fought against affirmative action, wasremembered Monday by President Reagan as a ``leading apostle of ajust and color-blind society.''   Pendleton, 57, one of the Reagan administration's highest-rankingblacks, collapsed and died Sunday of an apparent heart attack whileexercising at a health club in San Diego, where he lived.   Funeral services for Pendleton, who had suffered a heart attackin 1976 and battled high blood pressure, were scheduled Wednesday atSt. Paul's Cathedral in San Diego, a family spokeswoman said Monday.   Pendleton drew bitter criticism during his 6{-year tenure ascommission chairman for opposing civil rights policies such asracial quotas and busing in conformance with Reagan's stance.   ``Yesterday, with the sudden death of Clarence Pendleton, Americalost a leading apostle of a just and color-blind society,'' Reagansaid in a statement. ``Clarence Pendleton early in life took up thebanner of equal rights for all Americans and boldly carried thebanner forward.''   Reagan also invoked the memory of slain civil rights leaderMartin Luther King Jr. in praising the man he called ``Penny.''   Pendleton leaves behind a confidence ``that one day all Americanswill be judged not by stereotypes and prejudices, but on their ownmerits, qualifications, performance _ as Penny often quoted MartinLuther King Jr., `Not ... by the color of their skin but by thecontent of their character.'''   No autopsy will be performed, Deputy Coroner Jack Larkie said,adding that Pendleton's physician would identify the cause of death.Deputy Coroner David Lodge said it appeared he had suffered a heartattack.   Friends and acquaintances remembered Pendleton as a dedicatedpublic servant and principled man.   John E. Jacob, president and chief executive of the NationalUrban League, said, ``Despite our very forceful disagreement aboutkey issues affecting black Americans, I respected his right to thoseopinions, as he respected my right to differ.   ``He was a good friend and a formidable adversary.''   ``He had a lot of courage and took stands, sometimes, thatweren't very popular,'' said San Diego police Chief Bill Kolender,who had known Pendleton for 15 years.   But San Diego County Supervisor Leon Williams called Pendleton an``embarrassment'' to blacks.   ``I don't know any black people who thought his positions wereadmirable,'' said Williams, who is black.   In November 1981, Reagan appointed Pendleton as commissionchairman to replace the fired Arthur S. Flemming, who had criticizedthe administration's civil rights policies as ``in conflict with theConstitution.''   The bipartisan commission is an advisory body that monitorsenforcement of civil rights laws within the federal government. Itlacks policy-making or enforcement powers.   Pendleton maintained that equal treatment _ not specialpreferences _ should form the basis for federal civil rightspolicies.   He once termed the concept of comparable worth, which envisionswomen receiving the same salary as men with similar jobs, ``thelooniest idea since `Looney Tunes.''' He called affirmative action``divisive, unpopular and immoral,'' and opposed busing.   He also criticized the Civil Rights Restoration Act, passedearlier this year over Reagan's veto, as ``an unwarranted invasion... by Big Brother.''   His views made him a lightening rod for criticism of the Reagan'sadministration's approach to civil rights enforcement.   In July 1986, congressional critics unsuccessfully tried toreplace the commission with a new Office of Civil Rights Assessment,accusing the commission under Pendleton of becoming a ``politicalinstrument of the executive branch.''   Pendleton dismissed the move and said it ``simply reflects thepolitical differences'' between some members of Congress and thecommission majority.   Pendleton was alone when he collapsed Sunday morning in theexercise room of the San Diego Hilton Beach and Tennis Resort, saidGary Lingley, director of the hotel's tennis club. Pendleton hadattended regularly since joining the club several months ago.   Pendleton, an avid jogger and swimmer, once taught physicaleducation in college and worked as a government recreation directorin Washington, and Baltimore before being named director of theModel Cities Department in San Diego in 1972. He was president ofthe Urban League in San Diego from 1975 until 1982.   Pendleton graduated from Howard University in 1954 and afterserving in the Army he returned to earn a masters' degree ineducation.   Pendleton's is survived by his wife, Margrit, and their daughter,Paula, as well as by two grown children from a previous marriage wholive in Washington, D.C.</TEXT></DOC>
