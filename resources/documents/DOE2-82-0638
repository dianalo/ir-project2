<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-82-0638 </DOCNO><TEXT>The concept of a photovoltaic central receiver system has existed forabout ten years, but was not seriously considered because of the highcost and marginal quality of the PV cells. Recent breakthroughs in PVcell efficiency and quality coupled with the design of low-cost heliostatshas justified reconsideration of the concept. An economic analysis showsthat small PVCR systems can probably produce electricity at cost-effectiverates with a minimal capital investment. However, this analysis assumesthat some significant technical problems can be solved. An experimentalprogram has been developed to address these problems, and the preliminaryresults are encouraging. If successful, it is anticipated that the PVCRtechnology could be marketable within the next five years. 10 refs.,2 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
