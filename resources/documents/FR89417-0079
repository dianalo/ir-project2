We now receive most of this dataon paper, even though submitters keep much of it electronically, and thedata is often destined for computerized databases at EPA. The Agency wouldtherefore like to consider the possibility of allowing submitters to reportthis data electronically, either by transmission over telephone line orby submitting the data on a magnetic medium (e.g., floppy disks or magnetictape). We believe that giving submitters this option could result in substantialcost savings for the Agency and the regulated community, and provide suchother benefits as improving the overall quality of the data by reducingthe opportunity for transcriptional errors. EPA is aware that many private organizations have already successfullyinstituted electronic reporting for routine business transactions by meansof electronic data interchange (EDI). To implement EDI, the American NationalStandards Institute (ANSI) has developed the ``ANSI X.12 Data InterchangeStandards'', which appear to have wide application in the private sectorand in some government agencies. These standards specify how data mustbe represented in an electronic medium and ensure that all data transmittedamong EDI participants conform to the same electronically recognizableformat. Given these standards as a platform, the private sector has erectedthe software and hardware infrastructure for a reliable and cost-effectivesystem of EDI. The private sector's success in using the ANSI X.12 standards clearly demonstratesthe role that uniform data standards can play in fostering electronic reporting.The Agency therefore wishes to consider the utility and feasibility ofsetting electronic reporting standards for the data that our programs receivefrom the regulated community. Given the example of EDI, such standards_applicable<T3>uniformly </T3>across all of the Agency's environmental programs_maybe at least a necessary foundation for a coherent Agency-wide approachto electronic reporting. We believe that only by taking such an approachcan the Agency and the regulated community realize the full economic benefitsof electronic reporting. For these reasons, EPA has established an Agency-wideworkgroup to assess the merits of uniform standards for the electronicreporting of technical and administrative data required for the Agency'senvironmental programs. The workgroup will then proceed to develop andinstitute such standards as appropriate. In announcing the establishment of the Electronic Reporting Standards (ERS)Workgroup, this advance notice solicits public comments and informationon existing capabilities for electronic reporting. Specifically, we wishto know whether the ANSI X.12 standards would be a good model for purposesof reporting data to EPA_whether via transmission over telephone line oron a magnetic medium. We also wish to know what other data standards maybe in use in industry and in government, and how we should work with otherorganizations in the private and public sectors in instituting uniformelectronic reporting standards. By engaging in a public dialogue at anearly stage, we hope to benefit from the experiences of the regulated community,and the private sector generally, in considering electronic data standards.We also hope to benefit from the experiences of other federal agenciesand State and local governments. We hope that such dialogue will help ensurethat any data standards we ultimately develop will be as compatible aspossible with current practices, both in industry and in government. <ITAG tagnum="84">Requirements for Electronic Reporting Standards </ITAG>EPA believes that any electronic reporting standards that the Agency ultimatelyadopts should satisfy the following requirements:1. They must be uniform across the Agency. 2. They must be flexible enough to accommodate the different informationrequirements of each of EPA's program offices. 3. They must be compatible, to the extent possible, with the standardsthat are already in wide use in the regulated community, in EPA programoffices, and at other Federal and State agencies. 4. They must not dictate the use of particular computer software and hardware,and must be compatible with any standard mode of electronic data transfer,whether via transmission over telephone line or on a magnetic medium. We would like public comment on the appropriateness of these four requirements,as well as suggestions for additional requirements that the ERS Workgroupmay consider. <ITAG tagnum="84">Development of Uniform Standards </ITAG>In developing electronic reporting standards, the ERS Workgroup will seriouslyconsider the approach represented by the ANSI X.12 standards, althoughwe will want to examine other models as well. Correspondingly, we are interestedin knowing whether data standards other than the ANSI X.12 are being usedto implement EDI or other forms of electronic reporting and we would welcomeinformation on such standards. In developing uniform, Agency-wide standards, the ERS Workgroup will want,to the extent possible, to build on current electronic reporting initiativesalready underway in EPA program offices_for example, the electronic reportingunder Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-KnowAct (Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986).We would likewise want to build on electronic reporting efforts withinthe regulated community_as well as within State and local government_particularlywhere the data being transmitted is of the same kinds that would be submittedto EPA. We therefore solicit any available information on such activities.Given the goal of setting uniform standards for use across the Agency,we are not certain at this time how specific the standards should be toparticular data elements. Therefore, the ERS Workgroup will most likelyconsider both specific as well as generic data standards. While the distinctionis somewhat relative and pragmatic, for our purposes a ``specific standard''pertains to a particular data element and defines such things as maximumlength; whether the data can be characters, numbers, or both; left or rightjustification within fields; leading or trailing blanks or zeros; and soon. A ``generic standard'', on the other hand, prescribes the structureand location of a data ``module'', i.e., a group of functionally relateddata elements. A generic standard might include instructions on how themodule will be labelled; what mandatory and optional data elements thecomponent will consist of; as well as how the data elements in the modulewill be sequenced, labelled, and separated from each other. The appendixto this notice provides two examples to illustrate these concepts. Theseexamples are solely for purposes of illustration and may not reflect theapproach that the ERS Workgroup will eventually take. In any event, weare interested in public comments on the relative importance of genericand specific standards_as we have explained these concepts_to the effortof moving the Agency toward electronic reporting. The ERS Workgroup will identify and evaluate electronic reporting standardsnow in use in Agency program offices and elsewhere in the private and publicsectors. On the basis of that evaluation, together with the comments andinformation received from the public, the Workgroup will decide whetherto proceed with the development of such standards for the Agency. If thedecision is to proceed, the ERS Workgroup will propose a set of standardsfor Agency-wide adoption_at least for those data elements or modules ofinterest to more than one EPA program office. We intend to publish theseproposed standards in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>for public review and comment. Following theWorkgroup's evaluation of the public comments on the proposed standards,we will develop the final standards. Upon completion, we will publish thesestandards in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Participation</ITAG>In the foregoing discussion, we have suggested a number of questions forpublic comment. To summarize them in a list, they are:(1) Will the ``ANSI X.12 Data Interchange Standards'' serve as a good modelfor EPA electronic reporting standards?(2) Are there any electronic reporting standards other than the ANSI X.12standards that are widely and successfully used? If you know of such standards,please give us as much information as you can about them and how they compareto the ANSI standards.(3) What experience have State and local governments had with electronicreporting? What lessons are there for EPA in the State/local experience?(4) Are there specific electronic reporting activities within the communityof organizations that provide data to EPA_the private sector companies,the State and local government agencies, etc._that we should take accountof as we set electronic reporting standards? Please give us as much informationas you can about such activities and explain how they may be applicableto EPA.(5) Are the four requirements discussed in the section entitled ``Requirementsfor Electronic Reporting Standards'' sufficient and appropriate? Is itpossible to develop standards that will satisfy them?(6) Do we need to develop generic standards, specific standards, or both(given our concepts of ``generic'' and ``specific'')? For what kinds ofdata would each type of standard be most appropriate?(7) What kind of certification method(s) can be used in electronic reportingwhereby the submitter can ``certify'' that the information submitted istrue and represents the complete response required by EPA?(8) What problems or issues will EPA have to address in using electronicallyreported data as evidence in administrative and judicial civil and criminalenforcement actions?(9) What problems/issues are there in providing for the security of electronicallyreported data? Can confidential business information (CBI) be submittedelectronically? If so, how can the security of CBI be assured?(10) In general, how should the Agency work with the private sector insetting and implementing electronic reporting standards? What should bethe proper role of the regulated community and of the information serviceindustry? What incentives, if any, can EPA offer to the regulated communityto promote the use of these standards for electronic reporting?(11) Similarly, how should EPA work with the State and local governments,and with public interest groups, in setting and implementing electronicreporting standards?(12) What would be the most efficient and cost-effective way for the Agencyto make our electronic reporting standards available to the public? Howshould the Agency keep the public informed of changes and updates to thestandards?(13) How would electronic reporting affect small business? What, if anything,can EPA do to assist small business in instituting electronic reportingto the Agency?(14) What implications could the move from paper to electronic or magneticsubmissions have for public access to the submitted data? How would orshould this affect EPA's responses to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)requests?If you wish to respond to one or more of these questions, please followthe procedures specified in the section of this notice entitled ``ADDRESSES'',and please label your response to indicate the numbers of the question(s)to which it pertains. If you are submitting information on additional electronicdata standards, please provide as much background information as you can,to help us evaluate the usefulness of these standards for our purposes.We also welcome your suggestions of other issues to be considered, andany general comments you may have on the benefits or costs of electronicreporting, and on the utility of setting standards for electronic reporting.Although the ERs workgroup does not plan to hold public meetings, appropriateAgency staff members will be available to meet informally with anyone whorequests a face-to-face discussion of comments/suggestions. The meetingswould be held at EPA Headquarters in Washington, DC, at a time mutuallyconvenient for you and Agency staff. If you wish to meet with Agency staff,submit a request in writing during the comment period, indicating threealternative days as well as the topic(s) that you want to discuss. We willrespond directly to your request within 45 days after the close of thecomment period. You may also use the same procedure to request discussionsor meetings via telephone.We believe that the success of this effort depends on a meaningful publicdialogue at the earliest possible stage. We therefore urge all interestedparties to submit comments and/or suggestions in response to this notice.<ITAG tagnum="6">Thomas E.
