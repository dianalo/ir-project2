Trading and underwriting losses could reach $100 million, Eurobond specialists say, as investor confidence and market liquidity suddenly dried up last week. Prices of many issues dropped as much as four points, or $400,000 for each $10 million face amount.    The &quot;result is likely to be a massive turnover of jobs and a 50% shrinkage of the market,&quot; says Valerie E. Thompson, head of Eurobond syndication at Salomon Brothers International Ltd. &quot;Certainly the losses are of a magnitude that hasn't been seen in the floating-rate note market.&quot;    Hans-Joerg Rudloff, deputy chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd., says the debacle &quot;is just the first warning shot into the middle of a ship. We took our share of losses on some issues. It's clear that our floating-rate note business won't be a major contributor to our earnings as it has in each of the past several years.&quot;    Perpetual floating-rate notes total about $17 billion and were created less than two years ago as a relatively cheap source of capital, mostly for British, Canadian and Australian commercial banks and other financial institutions. The undated securities typically pay a more generous margin of interest above benchmark money market rates, such as the London interbank rate for three-month or six-month Eurodollar deposits, than conventional floating-rate notes.    Borrowers rushed to issue perpetual notes because the securities generally aren't redeemable and their interest costs are well below those on long-term fixed-rate issues. But the borrowing binge masked widespread turbulence among underwriters, who piled up huge inventories of unsold issues this year.    &quot;It got to the point where you had a better chance being struck by lightning than being able to sell new paper,&quot; Ms. Thompson says. &quot;The investor base was never as broad as (underwriters) said it was,&quot; she says. &quot;Now many firms are paying the price.&quot;    Although Eurobond traders previously have suspended market making in individual debt and equity issues or in securities from borrowers in a single country, last Wednesday's trading halt in perpetual floating-rate notes was the first to cover an entire market sector. Trading resumed Thursday and Friday on a sporadic basis.    &quot;That doesn't suggest the market's problems are over,&quot; says Paul Dennison, a money market specialist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. &quot;I've been trading in this market for 10 years and it never had to close. The fact that the entire floating-rate note market was affected by one particular type of instrument shows how big a shakeout this has been.&quot;    Ironically, the market's collapse &quot;has nothing to do with the economy or interest rates,&quot; which have fallen substantially from a year ago, says Archibald Cox Jr., a managing director of Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and head of its London office. &quot;It was simply a question of confidence. The only reason people were prepared to buy (perpetual issues) is because there was a perception that the market was liquid. Now, there is no liquidity and, at the very least, it will prove difficult&quot; to issue such undated securities in the future.    Separately, the market for British government bonds developed a peppier tone last week, but retail support remained thin and analysts doubt market conditions will encourage much more buying just yet.    The major concern this week will be the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its effect on oil prices and the pound.    Analysts say the meeting isn't likely to produce a new agreement to boost oil prices, which would have a bearish impact on the pound and the British government bond, or gilt, market. </TEXT></DOC>
