The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' 13 membersnations, most of whose delegations arrived a day before Saturday'sopening session, are deeply divided over ways to boost pricesthrough production cuts.   The cartel is split over whether to change an existing agreementamong 12 of its members to limit daily production to 15.06 millionbarrels. The pact, which was extended in December and is due toexpire June 30, was aimed at supporting oil prices at $18 a barrel,but OPEC oil has been selling for about $1.50 below that.   Iraq refused to sign because it wants a quota equal to that ofits enemy Iran.   Oil experts predicted the cartel would be unable to reach aconsenus on how to tackle the problem and would end up extendingits existing agreement through the rest of the year.   ``It will be a rollover of what they've got,'' said HarryNeustein, a New York-based oil trader attending the OPEC meeting.   The oil futures markets also showed little optimism Friday.   In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Julycontract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil,closed down 34 cents a barrel to $16.73 on Friday.   Oil prices have been weak amid reports that many OPEC membershave exceeded the daily production cap and as worldwide oilreserves continue to rise.   In addition, some non-OPEC oil nations, which produce around23.2 million barrels a day, failed in late Arpil to get OPEC toagree to jointly cut production. That was the first major effort toform a worldwide alliance among oil producers to boost prices.   These competing non-OPEC producers, which are producing more andmore of the world's oil and now account for 60 percent of output,also have been making significant new oil discoveries.   Meanwhile, rumors have been circulating _ particularly out ofthe Arab summit in Algeria this week _ that Iran and Iraq might beclose to agreeing to end their 8-year-old Persian Gulf war. Thatwould result in a sharp increase in the two countries' oil ouput,putting further pressure on oil prices, experts said.   OPEC's other members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia,Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emiratesand Venezuela.   Longer-term, all oil producers are being asked to meet less ofthe world's energy needs in the face of competition from othersources _ natural gas, nuclear energy, coal and others.   Crude oil provides about 50 percent of the world's energy.Consumption of crude oil in non-Communist nations has fallen to 50million barrels a day from a peak of 57 million barrels a day in1979.   Even though oil demand is expected to increase in the secondhalf of the year, ``you're living in a wash of energy now, not ashortage of energy,'' said Neustein.</TEXT></DOC>
