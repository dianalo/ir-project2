A company-imposed deadline for a second round ofmultibillion-dollar bids to buy the food and tobacco conglomeratewas scheduled to expire at 5 p.m. today, and no decisions wereexpected before Wednesday.   Speculation that new, fatter offers would emerge pushed RJRNabisco's stock price up $1 a share Monday to $89, more than 50percent above its value before the takeover saga began two monthsago. The stock rose another 87{ cents by late this morning in heavytrading.   At least two of the three known bidders _ an RJR Nabiscomanagement group and the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andCo. _ were working on revised proposals, according to peoplefamiliar with the bidding process.   There was no indication Monday whether the third contender, agroup led by the investment firm First Boston Corp., planned toalter its bid, which in the first round was considered the riskiestbut potentially the richest.   A special committee of RJR Nabisco's outside directors,conducting the auction for the nation's 19th largest industrialcompany, declined comment on whether any additional bidders hademerged.   But officials of Atlanta-based RJR Nabisco had said previouslythat the structure for evaluating all offers would remain unchangedfrom the first round, which took place Nov. 18-20.   In that process, proposals were submitted in secret to a New Yorklaw firm representing the special committee, followed by a analysisof what they were worth and an announcement of the committee'sintentions.   The outside directors extended the auction after the first roundended, reflecting their view that those proposals were inadequate insubstance and price.   RJR Nabisco's management offered $100 a share in cash andsecurities for a total of about $22.7 billion. Kohlberg Kravisoffered $94 a share in cash and securities, or $21.3 billion. FirstBoston said it might offer $105 to $118 a share in cash andsecurities, or $23.8 billion to $26.8 billion.   Wall Street strategists speaking on condition they not beidentified said there was a widespread presumption that the RJRNabisco management group and Kohlberg Kravis would have to raisetheir previous offers to at least match the potential worth of theFirst Boston proposal.   Of the three bidders, the most uncertainty surrounded FirstBoston, which in its original offer proposed using a tax loopholethat expires at the end of this year to raise the value of its offerabove the others.   Under the original plan, the First Boston group would buy RJRNabisco's tobacco business with a so-called installment note, whichwould not be subject to a capital gains tax for a number of years,thereby giving the firm additional money to pay shareholders afatter price.   But that part of the transaction would have to be completed byDec. 31 because Congress closed the loophole on this capital-gainsdeferment, leaving many tax experts skeptical about whether FirstBoston's offer was realistic.   The struggle for RJR Nabisco began in late October when themanagement group led by its chairman, F. Ross Johnson, said it wasconsidering a debt-financed acquisition of the company, maker ofhundreds of products ranging from Salem cigarettes to Del Montecanned fruits.   The amount and heavy use of borrowed money in the takeover plansso far have dwarfed all records and incited critical scrutiny ofsuch debt-financed deals. In recent years, such deals have enrichedmany investors but raised questions about the economic impact of theadditional debt load on the companies.</TEXT></DOC>
