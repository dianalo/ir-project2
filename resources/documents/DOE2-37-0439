<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-37-0439 </DOCNO><TEXT>A process is described for the preparation of an ultrapure active metalfluoride of improved purity wherein the active metal is selected fromthe group consisting of Zr, Hf, Th, Sc, Y and rate earth metals, fromits active oxide comprising the steps of: (a) reacting the oxide of theactive metal with a predetermined amount of aqueous hydrofluoric acidto form a solid reaction product; (b) drying the solid reaction productunder controlled heating to form a hydrated fluoride of the chosen activemetal having a predetermined amount of hydration; and (c) exposing thehydrated active metal fluoride to a reactive atmosphere of hydrofluoricacid vapor in a carbon dioxide reactive carrier gas, and a selected halogencontaining compound in the gas phase at a predetermined elevated temperaturefor a predetermined period of time to thereby further increase anionpurity.</TEXT></DOC>
