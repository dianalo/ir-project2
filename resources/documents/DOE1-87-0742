Thesetwo techniques show a biphasic relationship which can be explained onthe basis of the relative amounts of the lipoprotein levels present inthe plasma and a good correlation with total triglyceride concentrationsobtained from standard blood tests. The major difference in the GPC elutionprofiles (254 nm) of plasma from normal individuals and that from cancerpatients occurred in the peak eluting at the void volume. This peak hasa retention time consistent with very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)and is elevated in most cancer patients and in normal patients with triglyceridelevels greater than 200 mg/ml. The use of these techniques as a screeningtest for cancer in an asymptomatic population needs further evaluation.</TEXT></DOC>
