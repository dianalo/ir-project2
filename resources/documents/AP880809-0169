Yazov says the SovietUnion must fight complacency in the ranks and delays in new weaponsprograms if it is to keep other countries from gaining militarysuperiority.   In an article published Tuesday, Yazov recommended ambitiousaction to cleanse the military of outdated attitudes, improve thereliability of military hardware and make the ``human factor''dominant in the Soviet military.   Yazov's article in the Defense Ministry newspaper Red Star wasan unusually frank account of problems in the Soviet military.Before Mikhail S. Gorbachev began his policy of glasnost, oropenness, the military was presented only as strong andproblem-free.   The defense minister has spoken candidly of the military'sproblems since he was appointed in May 1987. The 64-year-old armygenera was quoted as saying in a speech three months ago thatSoviet soldiers in East Germany lack discipline and battlereadiness.   His latest comments encompassed the entire Soviet armed forces.   ``Our military thought is still partially constrained byinertia, routine and a lack of competition of ideas and opinions,''he wrote.   He said the gap must be reduced between theoretical research onnew weapons and their actual development and deployment, andoversimplification and showiness must be removed from militarytraining.   Bureaucracy and a tendency to blame problems on others plaguesthe Soviet armed forces at all levels, Yazov declared. He saidyoung commanders, soldiers and officers take a passive attitudetoward deficiences.   Senior officers must not alienate themselves from those theycommand, he wrote, and ``all ideological and political upbringingmust be built so that the person is always in the center ofattention.''   Yazov said the goal should not be ``accumulation of militarymight of the armed forces ... but maintenance of the might at alevel that precludes military superiority over us and guarantees areliable defense.''   Last week, Yazov toured Soviet military facilities with FrankCarlucci, the visiting U.S. defense secretary.</TEXT></DOC>
