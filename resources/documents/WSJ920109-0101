As 1992 begins, free trade's woes appear to begrowing.   There was some evidence of this last month at a seminar inSanta Clara, Calif., sponsored by Locate in Scotland, theinvestment arm of Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish OfficeIndustry Department, and this newspaper. A major reason forthe session was the imminence of Europe '92, the program thatwill, among other things, bring down trade barriers withinthe European Community.</LP><TEXT>   Europe '92 is likely to make it relatively harder for U.S.firms to sell in Europe if they rely entirely on shippinggoods from the U.S. The major speaker at the meeting -- a manlargely responsible for drawing some 100 electronicsexecutives to the session -- was Scott McNealy, president andchief executive of Sun Microsystems, which in the past yearopened a manufacturing and supply facility in Linlithgow,Scotland. Sun still expects to be a major exporter. Accordingto a recent Fortune magazine article, Sun ranks second onlyto Boeing among major U.S. exporters, based on percentage ofrevenues exported. But this year Sun expects to be servicingEuropean countries from Europe.   Avoiding trade barriers is only one reason for producingabroad. Customers can be serviced more quickly and cheaplyfrom facilities nearby. It's also likely to be easier to wingovernment business with facilities inside the country. Butthe Scots here didn't play down the fact that &quot;U.S. companieslocating in Scotland gain tariff-free access to the EuropeanEconomic Community markets, the largest market in the worldvalued at $4.83 trillion.&quot;   U.S. business has always seen the EC as a barrier to U.S.exports. The community was founded in 1957 when Belgium, theNetherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, France and Italy signed theTreaty of Rome. Over the years the group added Denmark,Greece, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal. Fromthe start, American firms sought to counter the EC byinvesting so heavily in Europe that some Europeans claimedthe U.S. wanted to take over the world.   U.S. investment abroad, or at home, is likely to be weakin 1992 as the economy continues to grow slowly through mostof the year. So U.S. businessmen will lean heavily ongovernment support, such as President Bush's current trip toJapan to persuade the Japanese to open more markets toAmerican goods and services.   Economies are weak in Europe as well. Even Japan isexperiencing slower growth. In such circumstances it isn'tsurprising that governments are trying to squeeze morerevenue out of trade. House Minority Leader Richard Gephardtis working on legislation aimed at helping U.S. autocompanies at the expense of their Japanese competitors. Thefree trade agreements between the U.S. and Canada and theU.S. and Mexico are viewed by some Europeans and Asians asefforts to keep them out of the North American market. At thesame time, some Americans fear that the agreement with Mexicowill hurt U.S. firms by admitting goods produced bylower-paid Mexican workers.   The economic troubles around the world help to explain whythe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is having so muchtrouble completing its current negotiations. GATT, whosesigners included most of the world's major trading nations,over the years has made major gains toward reducing tradebarriers. But the current talks, which began five years agoin Uruguay, appear to be hopelessly bogged down on Americandemands that Europe and Japan open their markets to U.S. farmgoods. Arthur Dunkel, GATT's director general, took theunusual step of drawing up a proposed settlement of all ofGATT's differences, but this plan met a cold reception fromseveral EC nations, largely because it included a reductionin European subsidies to farmers.   There's plenty of trouble within the EC itself. Theultimate aim of the EC is a common economic policy, butpolicy disagreements now are plentiful. The EC distaste forMr. Dunkel's proposed farm-subsidy plan comes mainly fromFrance and Ireland. Other EC nations, particularly Britainand the Netherlands, appear more willing to compromise. Butthe EC is struggling to achieve unanimity.   Unanimity, of course, will not be needed if the communityachieves the goals of Europe '92 -- the majority will rule.The change was intended to ease agreement on a final pact,but in some ways it has made agreement more difficult.   The community, for instance, had planned on one pact togovern working conditions throughout the EC, but Britainbalked. Within the community, there is still lingeringresentment among some members over what they regard asGermany's attempt to dominate the group. Current Germanefforts to curb domestic inflation are pushing up interestrates throughout the EC, contributing to the group's economicweakness.   In these troubled economic times, trade restraints persisteven among the states of the U.S., even though suchrestraints are supposed to be unconstitutional. For years theAgricultural Marketing Service of the Agriculture Departmenthas administered &quot;milk marketing orders&quot; that restrictshipment of milk among 41 regions. What's the reason for suchrestrictions? James Bovard, who writes frequently on theissue, says, &quot;They've been doing it for a long time, and Iguess they figure there's no reason to stop now.&quot;   This year, &quot;free trade&quot; is likely to have tough times athome and abroad.</TEXT></DOC>
