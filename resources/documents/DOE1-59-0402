The RELAP4/MOD6 code is used tosimulate the primary circuit behaviour during the accident. It is assumedthat only the automatic safety and control systems respond to the disturbanceand there is no operator action. The purpose of the study is to determinethe critical moments for the core and primary circuit components andthe key parameters to be analyzed in case of emergency for adequate operatorresponse. Simulation results indicate that: (i) the minimal coolant flowrate reached during the first 3000 s of the transient is 320 kg/s, (ii)thermal conditions of the fuel elements and CHF ratio for an averagechannel are within the admissible tolerance; (iii) when two ECC pumpsare in operation (switched on at 10.3 MPa, 34 s) the two-phase mixturelevel at 3000 s nearly reaches the hot leg. Switching off the ECC pumpscauses a rapid increase in the core and upper plenum void fraction anda decrease in the upper plenum fluid level, due to the loss of coolant,which may lead to a core dry up.</TEXT></DOC>
