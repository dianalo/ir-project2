Interested persons were invited to submit commentsby December 6, 1982. Reply comments in response to comments filed in theinitial comment period could be submitted by January 5, 1983.In accordance with andSection;330.10(a)(10), the data and information consideredby the Panel were put on public display in the Dockets Management Branch,after deletion of a small amount of trade secret information.In response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking relating to theexternal analgesic use of OTC astringent drug products, four drug manufacturers,two trade associations, and one health professional submitted comments.In response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking relating to theskin protectant use of OTC astringent drug products, one of the same manufacturersand the two same trade associations submitted comments. Copies of the commentsreceived are on public display in the Dockets Management Branch.In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 15, 1983 (48 FR 6820), the agencypublished a notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC skin protectant drugproducts. The agency issued this notice after considering the report andrecommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Topical Analgesic,Antirheumatic, Otic, Burn, and Sunburn Prevention and Treatment Drug Products(Topical Analgesic Panel) and public comments on an advance notice of proposedrulemaking that was based on those recommendations. Interested personswere invited to submit comments by April 18, 1983, new data by February15, 1984, and comments on the new data by April 16, 1984.The agency has determined that the external analgesic and skin protectantuses of OTC astringent drug products are so closely related that it wouldnot serve the public interest to proceed with two separate rulemakingsfor the same ingredients. Accordingly, the agency is proposing in thisdocument to combine the rulemakings for the external analgesic and skinprotectant uses of OTC astringent drug products and to place the monographfor these products in the OTC skin protectant monograph. In this noticeof proposed rulemaking, FDA states for the first time its position on theOTC uses of astringent drug products. Final agency action on this matterwill occur with the publication at a future date of a final rule for OTCskin protectant drug products.This proposal constitutes FDA's tentative adoption of the Panel's reportsand recommendations on OTC astringent drug products as modified on thebasis of the comments received and the agency's independent evaluationof the Panel's reports.The OTC drug procedural regulations (21 CFR 330.10) now provide that anytesting necessary to resolve the safety or effectiveness issues that formerlyresulted in a Category III classification, and submission to FDA of theresults of that testing or any other data, must be done during the OTCdrug rulemaking process before the establishment of a final monograph.Accordingly, FDA will no longer use the terms ``Category I'' (generallyrecognized as safe and effective and not misbranded), ``Category II'' (notgenerally recognized as safe and effective or misbranded), and ``CategoryIII'' (available data are insufficient to classify as safe and effective,and further testing is required) at the final monograph stage, but willuse instead the terms ``monograph conditions'' (old Category I) and ``nonmonographconditions'' (old Categories II and III). This document retains the conceptsof Categories I, II, and III at the tentative final monograph stage.The agency advises that the conditions under which the drug products thatare subject to this monograph would be generally recognized as safe andeffective and not misbranded (monograph conditions) will be effective 12months after the date of publication of the final monograph in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. On or after that date, no OTC drug product thatis subject to the monograph and that contains a nonmonograph condition,i.e., a condition that would cause the drug to be not generally recognizedas safe and effective or to be misbranded, may be initially introducedor initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unlessit is the subject of an approved application. Further, any OTC drug productsubject to this monograph that is repackaged or relabeled after the effectivedate of the monograph must be in compliance with the monograph regardlessof the date the product was initially introduced or initially deliveredfor introduction into interstate commerce. Manufacturers are encouragedto comply voluntarily with the monograph at the earliest possible date.If the agency determines that any labeling for a condition included inthe final monograph should be implemented sooner than the 12-month effectivedate, a shorter deadline may be established. Similarily, if a safety problemis identified for a particular nonmonograph condition, a shorter deadlinemay be set for removal of that condition from OTC drug products.All ``OTC Volumes'' cited throughout this document refer to the submissionsmade by interested persons pursuant to the call-for-data notices publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 16, 1973 (38 FR 31697) and August27, 1975 (40 FR 38179), or to additional information that has come to theagency's attention since publication of the advance notice of proposedrulemaking. The volumes are on public display in the Dockets ManagementBranch (address above).<ITAG tagnum="84">I. The Agency's Tentative Conclusions on the Comments</ITAG>1. One comment requested that the agency make clear in all future publicationsthat astringents applied to skin or mucous membrane to check oozing, discharge,or bleeding are ``drug'' products, and that astringent products used ascosmetics are not covered by this rulemaking. The comment stated that astringentproducts are well recognized as cosmetic products when used as skin cleansersand freshners; such uses are intended to produce temporary contractionsof the skin surface resulting in a smoother and more aesthetically pleasingappearance. The comment stated that the Panel itself recognized that ``thereare several varied definitions for astringents,'' one of which is as ``aliquid cosmetic for cleansing the skin and contracting the pores.'' (Seethe <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 7, 1982; 47 FR 39427 and 39445.)The comment added that in the original skin protectant publication in thisproceeding, the agency noted that skin protectant products are often componentsof cosmetics. (See the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of August 4, 1978; 43 FR 34628.)The comment argued that it is well-established that the legal status ofa product as a cosmetic or a drug, or both, is not determined by its ingredientsor physical properties, but by reference to the representations made forthe product by the vendor. The comment stated that this principle derivesfrom the definitions for ``cosmetic'' and ``drug'' in the Federal Food,Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) and noted that these definitions in sections201(i) and (g)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(i) and (g)(1)) both state ``articles<T3>intended</T3> ***'' (emphasis added). The comment maintained that theintended use is determined by reference to the vendor's intent, usuallyas shown by the labeling and advertising for the product, and cited <T3>National Nutritional Foods Assn.</T3> v. <T3>Mathews</T3>, 557 F.2d 325, 333, 335 (2d Cir. 1977); <T3>National Nutritional Foods Assn.</T3> v. <T3>FDA</T3>, 504 F.2d 761, 789 (2d Cir. 1974); <T3>United States</T3> v. ``<T3>Sudden Change</T3>,'' 409 F.2d 734, 739 (2d Cir. 1969). The commentstated ``The manufacturer of the article, through his representations inconnection with its sale, can determine the use to which the article isto be put,'' and then cited S. Rep. No. 361, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. (1935),quoted in Dunn, <T3>Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act </T3>(Stechert andamp; Co. 1938)at 240. The comment stated that at least one court has regarded productsfor which astringency claims are made as cosmetics and cited <T3>United States</T3> v. <T3>Magic Secret,</T3> 331 F.Supp. 912 (D. Md. 1971).The comment also expressed concern that well recognized astringent cosmeticproducts not be inadvertently and improperly affected by the rulemakingfor OTC astringent drug products. The comment suggested that the Panel'srecommended monographs be amended to insert the words ``drug product''after ``astringent'' wherever that term appears in the monograph. The commentcontended that such a clarification is consistent with the agency's statementin the preamble to the tentative final monograph for OTC skin bleachingdrug products that the OTC [drug] panels lack jurisdiction to review ormake recommendations with respect to cosmetic claims (See the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 3, 1982; 47 FR 39109.) The commentconcluded that the regulations (21 CFR Part 330) covering the OTC drugreview program grant the agency and the expert panel authority to reviewdrug claims only, not cosmetic claims.The agency agrees that this rulemaking, which amends the tentative finalmonograph for OTC skin protectant drug products, applies only to astringentproducts that fall within the statutory definition of ``drugs.'' In fact,in the tentative final monograph for OTC skin protectant drug products,the agency revised the scope of the rulemaking in order to make it clearthat the rulemaking extends only to drug products. (See comment 6 at 48FR 6822.) Based on that revision, which occurred after the advance noticesor proposed rulemaking for OTC astringent drug products were published,the agency has already clarified that this rulemaking applies to drug productsonly and not to cosmetics. The agency concludes that there is no need toadd the term ``drug product'' after the word ``astringent'' wherever thatterm appears in the monograph, as suggested by the comment.Any product marketed solely as a cosmetic need not conform to the finalmonograph. However, a product marketed as both a cosmetic and a drug mustconform to the requirements of the final monograph as relates to the drugaspects of the product. (See comment 6 at 48 FR 6822 to 6823.)2. One comment requested that the Panel's Category II classification ofborax and boric acid as ``active'' ingredients for use as an astringentbe reconsidered and that these ingredients be redesignated as ``inactive''ingredients. The comment noted that these ingredients are listed at 47FR 39425 as <T3>``Labeled ingredients contained in marketed products submitted to thePanel'' </T3>and at 47 FR 39426 as Category II astringent active ingredientsbecause the Panel had no data. The comment stated that it has examinedthe OTC volumes (Refs. 1 through 11) submitted to the Panel for productscontaining boric acid and/or borax and these submissions did not discloseany claims for their use as active ingredients. The comment added thatthese ingredients are not active when used as buffering agents (Refs. 1and 9) and that boric acid is present in concentrations of 0.012 percentand 2 percent in two submissions (Refs. 1 and 7) listed as astringent drugproducts. The comment stated that test data on boric acid in a number ofsubmissions (Refs. 2, 4, 5, and 11) contradict the Panel's statement thatit was not able to locate nor is it aware of data demonstrating the safetyand effectiveness of boric acid when used as an OTC astringent active ingredient.The comment added that aluminum acetate (modified Burow's solution) wasclassified in Category I as an astringent based on three submissions fora product containing 0.012 percent boric acid (Refs. 1, 2, and 3). Thecomment contended that Burow's solution contains aluminum acetate and alsocontains boric acid as a buffering agent or preservative, neither of whichuses make the boric acid an ``active'' ingredient. The comment concludedthat some of the ingredients which the Panel considered to be ``active''were not intended to be so classified within the meaning of the agency'sdefinition of ``active ingredient'' in 21 CFR 210.3(b)(7) and that boricacid and borax in astringent drug products were inactive ingredients asdefined in 21 CFR 210.3(b)(7) and (8).The agency has reviewed the submissions referred to by the comment anddetermined that the labeling and information contained in the submissionsrepresent boric acid as an ingredient for buffering and stabilizing properties.These uses of boric acid are considered inactive uses of this ingredient.However, other submissions to the Panel represent borax or boric acid asactive ingredients for astringent and/or other OTC drug uses (Refs. 4 through9). Based on the labeling in those submissions, the Panel appropriatelyclassified the ingredients as active ingredients for astringent use aswell as for other OTC drug uses. Because the Panel had no data demonstratingthe safety and effectiveness of these ingredients for use as an astringent,the Panel classified them in Category II. This Category II designationdoes not, of course, prevent the use of boric acid as a stabilizer or asa buffer at appropriate concentrations in OTC astringent or other drugproducts.Boric acid is considered an inactive ingredient when used as part of abuffering system or stabilizer in OTC drug products. Inactive ingredients,although not included in OTC drug monographs, must meet the requirementsof andSection; 330.1(e) (21 CFR 330.1(e)) that they be suitable ingredientsthat are safe in the amounts administered and do not interfere with theeffectiveness of the product or with tests to be performed on the product.Boric acid may be included as a buffering agent or stabilizer in the formulationof OTC drug products provided that it meets the above criteria.References<ITAG tagnum="25">(1) OTC Volume 160022.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(2) OTC Volume 160140.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(3) OTC Volume 160230.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(4) OTC Volume 160040.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(5) OTC Volume 160077.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(6) OTC Volume 160091.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(7) OTC Volume 160093.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(8) OTC Volume 160233.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(9) OTC Volume 160236.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(10) OTC Volume 160024.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(11) OTC Volume 160213.</ITAG>3. One comment stated that the pharmacological action of OTC ingredientsused on lesions amenable to treatment by external analgesics and astringentsis well known, but that the Panel did not include the combination of theseingredients in its recommended monograph. The comment requested that andSection;348.20 (permitted combinations) of the tentative final monograph for OTCexternal analgesic drug products be amended to include combinations ofingredients listed in andSection; 348.10 (a) and (b) of the advance noticeof proposed rulemaking for OTC external analgesic drug products (publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of December 4, 1979 at 44 FR 69864) and an astringentlisted in andSection; 348.10(c) of the advance notice of proposed rulemakingfor OTC astringent drug products at 47 FR 39432, provided that such productsare appropriately labeled for both classes of ingredients. The commentalso stated that the pharmacological action of OTC ingredients used onlesions amenable to treatment by skin protection and astringents is wellknown. The comment requested that andSection; 347.20 (permitted combinations)of the tentative final monograph for OTC skin protectant drug productsbe amended to include combinations of a skin protectant listed in the tentativefinal monograph in proposed andSection; 347.10 (48 FR 6832) and an astringentlisted in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC astringentdrug products in recommended andSection; 347.12 (47 FR 39450).In the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC astringent drug products,the Panel stated that it concurred with the FDA guidelines for OTC combinationdrug products (Ref. 1), which state that Category I active ingredientsfrom different therapeutic categories may be combined to treat differentsymptoms concurrently only if each ingredient is present within its establishedsafe and effective dosage range and the combination meets the OTC combinationpolicy in all other respects. (See 47 FR 39430 and 39448). Although statingthat it was aware of products that combine various OTC ingredients withan astringent (47 FR 39429 and 39448), the Panel did not provide for anycombinations in its recommended monograph nor did it specifically mentionthe combination of an external analgesic or a skin protectant with an astringent.In response to the comment's request to include the combination of an externalanalgesic and an astringent in the tentative final monograph for OTC externalanalgesic drug products, the agency has surveyed the OTC drug marketplaceto determine if there are any such combinations. The agency has determinedthat such combinations are currently being marketed with claims as fortemporary relief of itching or for anal/perianal itching and discomfort(Refs. 2 and 3). These products contain Category I external analgesicswith Category I astringents, such as menthol and camphor with aluminumacetate and pramoxine hydrochloride with witch hazel (Refs. 2 and 3).In andSection; 346.22(g) of the tentative final monograph for OTC anorectaldrug products, the agency proposed the combination of an astringent andan external analgesic (analgesic, anesthetic, and antipruritic) in CategoryI based on the recommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC HemorrhoidalDrug Products (Hemorrhoidal Panel). (See the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of August 15, 1988; 53 FR 30756.) Thus, the agencyhas proposed that ingredients in the astringent and external analgesictherapeutic categories may be combined to treat anorectal symptoms, i.e.,an astringent to relieve irritation and/or burning and an external analgesicto relieve pain and/or burning. (See 53 FR 30782.) In addition, the agencyhas proposed that the labeling for such products would be a combinationof the respective monograph labeling for each ingredient and that the informationmay be combined in such a way to eliminate duplicative words or phrasesso that the resulting information is clear and understandable.In response to the comment's request to include the combination of a skinprotectant and an astringent in the tentative final monograph for OTC skinprotectant drug products, the agency has surveyed the OTC drug marketplacesto determine if there are any such combinations. The agency has determinedthat such combinations are currently being marketed with claims such asrelief of anorectal and/or vaginal irritation, burning, and itching (Ref.4). These products contain Category I skin protectants with Category Iastringents, such as glycerin with witch hazel and white petrolatum withwhich hazel (Ref. 4).The rulemaking on OTC vaginal drug products does not address the combinationof an astringent and a skin protectant because no such products were submittedfor consideration. The agency invites comments or new data to support suchcombinations to be submitted to the rulemaking for OTC vaginal drug productsfollowing publication of the tentative final monograph for those drugsin a future issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. However, data were submitted to the rulemakingfor OTC anorectal drug products, and in the tentative final monograph forOTC anorectal drug products, the agency proposed this combination in CategoryI based on the recommendations of the Hemorrhoidal Panel. (See the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of August 15, 1988; 53 FR 30756.) Thus, the agencyhas proposed that ingredients in the astringent and skin protectant therapeuticcategories may be combined to treat anorectal symptoms, i.e., an astringentto relieve irritation and/or burning and a protectant to protect inflamedperianal skin. In addition, the agency has proposed that the labeling forsuch products would be a combination of the respective monograph labelingfor each ingredient and that the information may be combined in such away to eliminate duplicative words or phrases so that the resulting informationis clear and understandable.Because the comment provided no information on specific products containingan external analgesic or a skin protectant with an astringent, on the symptons/conditionsto be treated concurrently, or on the proposed labeling for such combinations,the agency is proposing Category III status for these combinations at thistime for any other uses other than those already proposed in Category Iin the rulemaking for OTC anorectal drug products. The agency invites publiccomment and the submission of data, including product formulation, proposedlabeling, any test data, and marketing history related to the appropriatenessof such combinations containing an astringent for uses other than thosealready included in the rulemaking for OTC anorectal drug products.References<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) ``General Guidelines for OTC Drug Combination Products_September1978,'' Docket No. 78D-0322, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Boyd, J.

One comment requested clarification of the Panel's effectiveness recommendationfor which hazel. Referring to reference 8 (Ref. 1) of the Panel's discussionat 47 FR 39428, the comment stated anorectal the Panel failed to distinguishbetween witch hazel extract, which contains hamamelitannin, and witch hazelwater, which contains no tannin because it is distilled. The comment contendedthat these two preparations contain different active ingredients but arediscussed in a commingled and confusing way under the single title ``WitchHazel.'' Quoting one of the Panel's statements regarding distilled witchhazel extract, i.e., ``The tannin of witch hazel bark on distillation remainsin the residue and is absent from the distilled extracts,'' the commentcontended that this statement was incompatible with another statement thatthe Panel made in discussing the effectiveness of witch hazel, i.e., ``Literaturereports have attributed the astringent action of witch hazel to its tannincontent.'' The comment explained that both statements are correct, butthey are incompatible because the first statement refers to the distilledwitch hazel extract and the second statement refers to witch hazel extract(a nondistilled alcoholic extract). The comment added that the distilledwitch hazel extract is used chiefly as an astringent in after-shave lotionsand the nondistilled extract is used in preparations for relief of hemorrhoids.Because the Panel used the name ``Witch Hazel'' to refer to both preparations,the comment requested that the Panel's discussion be clarified as to whichof the ``witch hazel'' preparations is effective.The agency believes that the 2 statements in the Panel's report are generalstatements intended to provide background information concerning this ingredientand were not intended to be a definitive statement on witch hazel preparations.The Panel's recommended monograph clearly identifies ``Witch hazel, NFXI'' (Ref. 2) as the appropriate astringent active ingredient. NF XI refersto the ingredient as ``Hamamlis Water,'' with synonyms of ``Witch hazelWater'' and ``Distilled Witch-hazel Extract,'' and provides the methodof preparation. Because this ingredient is no longer listed in an officialcompendium, the agency has determined that ``Hamamelis water, NF XI'' willbe the accepted name for this ingredient in this tentative final monograph.In addition, in the tentative final monograph for OTC anorectal drug products(53 FR 30782), the agency also identified witch hazel water as Hamameliswater, NF XI'' and not as witch hazel extract, as suggested by the comment.References<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) ``Martindale.

One comment contended that the Panel's report (47 FR 39412) erroneouslyclassified aluminum sulfate in Category III as an OTC astringent ingredientin styptic pencils. Citing the transcript and minutes of the Panel's December15, 1980 final meeting, the comment stated that the Panel by a five totwo vote reclassified aluminum sulfate from Category III to Category I.The comment suggested that the Panel's published report may have been basedon the Panel's November 15, 1980, Information Copy in which aluminum sulfatewas tentatively classified in Category III. The comment requested thatthe published report be corrected in several places to reflect a CategoryI status.The comment added that the Panel's report at 47 FR 39429 erroneously saidthat ``In 75 years of marketing styptic pencils there have been reportedinstances of human toxicity.'' The comment stated that the InformationCopy said that no instances of human toxicity were reported in 75 yearsof marketing styptic pencils and requested that the published report becorrected to read, ``In 75 years of marketing styptic pencils there havebeen no reported instances of human toxicity.''In a letter dated November 15, 1982 (Ref. 1), the agency acknowledged thatthe requested corrections were valid, and stated that an apparent administrativeerror had occurred in that the Panel's vote at its final meeting to movealuminum sulfate to Category I was not incorporated into the final document.Although one submission to the Panel (Ref. 2) indicated an average aluminumsulfate concentration of approximately 57 percent, which served as thebasis for the Panel's recommendations, subsequent information from themanufacturer (Ref. 3) indicated that the 57-percent concentration was anaverage value based on the analysis of a limited number of samples andthat subsequent assays over time have shown that there is a significantvariation in concentration based on the amount of water physically boundto the aluminum sulfate. Experience from a larger number of batches ofstyptic pencils has shown concentrations ranging from 45.5 to 60.1 percent,with an average value of 53.9 percent. The manufacturer recommended a rangeof 46 to 61 percent anhydrous aluminum sulfate concentration for stypticpencils based on this actual manufacturing experience. Another submission(Ref. 4) provided a label claiming its product contained aluminum sulfate90 percent; however, the submission contained no information to supportthe 90-percent concentration and stated that it adopted the content ofthe other submission (Ref. 2). Subsequent information (Ref. 5) from thelatter manufacturer indicated that the concentration range of its productranged from 51.7 to 62.3 percent (with an average value of 56.2 percent)anhydrous aluminum sulfate based on batches in its manufacturing experience.Based on the Panel's recommendations, the information contained in thesubmissions (Refs. 2 and 4), and the additional information (Refs. 3 and5), the agency has determined that a range of 46 to 63 percent aluminumsulfate (based on the anhydrous equivalent) is acceptable for use as astyptic pencil and this concentration range is being proposed as CategoryI in this tentative final monograph. In addition, based on the same information,the agency is proposing the following indication: ``Stops bleeding causedby minor surface cuts and abrasions as may occur during shaving''; warning:``For external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes''; and directions:``Moisten tip of pencil with water and apply to the affected area. Drypencil after use.''References<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Letter from W. E.

Noting the Panel's reference to aluminum acetate solution as a ``clearsolution'' (47 FR 39427), one comment stated that this reference was basedon ``The United States Pharmacopeia XIX'' (U.S.P. XIX) (Ref. 1), whichdescribes Burow's Solution (aluminum acetate solution) prepared de novo.The comment contended that the U.S.P. procedure does not pertain to modifiedaluminum acetate solutions prepared from tablets or powders, which do notresult in a clear solution but do conform with all other requirements setforth in the Panel's recommended monograph. The comment requested thatthe reference to a clear aluminum acetate solution be deleted from theproposed monograph.The reference to aluminum acetate topical solution being a clear solutionwas included as part of the Panel's discussion of a U.S.P. XIX dispensingrequirement for this solution. (See 47 FR 39427.) This statement of theU.S.P. XIX dispensing requirement did not appear in the Panel's recommendedmonograph, nor will it appear as a requirement in this tentative finalmonograph. Therefore, no agency action is necessary in response to thecomment's request.The tentative final monograph proposes monograph status for aluminum acetateas an active ingredient in a use concentration of 0.13 to 0.5 percent.The final product may be prepared from tablets, powders, or liquid solutions.The tentative final monograph does not propose to address the clarity ofthe final solution that is prepared. However, any product that is marketedas Aluminum Acetate Topical Solution, U.S.P., would have to meet the compendialdispensing requirement of being a clear solution (Ref. 2).References<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) ``The United States Pharmacopeia,'' 19th Revision, Mack PublishingCo., Easton, PA, p. 20, 1975.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) ``United States Pharmacopeia XXI_National Formulary XVI,'' UnitedStates Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., Rockville, MD, p. 29, 1985.</ITAG>7. One comment contended that the Panel's recommended monograph containsseveral errors regarding aluminum acetate. The comment stated that Burow'sSolution, which is a 5-percent aluminum acetate solution, is further dilutedto yield a 1:20 to 1:40 solution for use as an astringent. Therefore, thecomment suggested that andSection; 348.10(c)(1) and all references in themonograph to aluminum acetate be revised to read ``Aluminum acetate solution,2.5 to 5 percent (equivalent to a 1:40 and 1:20 dilution, respectively).''The agency agrees that the use concentration for aluminum acetate was incorrectlystated in the Panel's recommended monograph. Further, as discussed in PartIII, paragraph B. 1, below, the agency has revised the use concentrationfor aluminum acetate for astringent use. The active ingredient listingbeing proposed for aluminum acetate in this tentative final monograph reads``Aluminum acetate, 0.13 to 0.5 percent (depending on the formulation andconcentration of the marketed product, the manufacturer must provide adequatedirections so that the resulting solution to be used by the consumer contains0.13 to 0.5 percent aluminum acetate).'' The 0.13 to 0.5 percent solutionscorrespond to 1/40 and 1/10 dilutions of a 5-percent aluminum acetate solution,respectively, and, therefore, include the concentrations mentioned by thecomment. Because the rulemakings for the external analgesic and skin protectantuses of OTC astringent drug products have been combined (see discussionabove), this information about aluminum acetate appears in proposed andSection;347.12(a) of this rulemaking on skin protectants and is being removed fromthe external analgesic rulemaking as it appeared in the Panel's recommendedmonograph in andSection; 348.10(c)(1), published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 7, 1982 (47 FR 39412).8. Referring to the Panel's recommended indication for products containingaluminum acetate, that states ``For use as a wet dressing, compress, orsoak for relief of inflammatory conditions and minor skin irritations dueto allergies, insect bites, athlete's foot, poison ivy, or swelling associatedwith minor bruises and ulcerations of the skin,'' one comment proposedthat the indication be revised to state more clearly the uses for aluminumacetate solution as follows: ``A soothing wet dressing for relief of skinirritations caused by conditions such as insect bites, diaper rash, sunburn,or those caused by poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, soaps, detergents,cosmetics, and jewelry. A cleansing and drying agent to prepare the skinprior to the application of other medications for athlete's foot or hydrocortisonefor rashes due to dermatitis and eczema. Helps to soften and remove crusts.''The agency has determined that some of the comment's suggestions are useful,while others are not. The agency does not normally include the word soothingin an indication for topical OTC drug products because many topical productscan be soothing when applied but the ``soothing'' effect has no relationshipto the pharmacologic action of the drug. In addition, the agency has previouslystated that it considers the term ``soothes'' to be a cosmetic claim inthe context of skin protectant products. (See comment 22 in the tentativefinal monograph for OTC skin protectant drug products at 48 FR 6827 to6828). The agency does not consider the phrase ``for use as a wet dressing(compress or soak)'' to be an indication, and is including such informationin the ``Directions'' section.The agency agrees that ``relief of inflammatory conditions and minor skinirritations'' can be replaced with ``relief of skin irritations'' becausethe latter phrase is shorter and conveys the same meaning. However, theagency is including the word ``minor'' in this phrase for consistency withthe indications for a number of other OTC topical drug products. The agencysees no need to replace the shorter phrase ``due to'' with the longer phrase``caused by conditions such as.''The Panel included ``poison ivy'' in its recommended indications for aluminumacetate. The agency concurs with this recommendation and is further extendingthe indications to also include ``poison oak'' and ``poison sumac.'' ThePanel also included ``insect bites'' in its recommended indications foraluminum acetate, and the agency concurs with this recommendation. ThePanel did not include ``diaper rash'' in its recommended indications, andthe agency is not aware of any data that support the use of aluminum acetatefor the treatment of diaper rash. Therefore, the agency is not including``diaper rash'' in the indications being proposed for aluminum acetate.The agency agrees with the comment that the terms ``soap, detergents, cosmetics,and jewelry'' are informative to describe some of the likely sources ofskin irritation that may be caused by allergies. However, because theseproducts are being used by the relief of minor skin irritations, the agencybelieves that it would be more informative and understandable by consumersif the labeling stated that the products relieved ``rashes'' caused bythese items, rather than ``allergies'' caused by these items. The ``rash''is the physical manifestation of the allergy that the consumer is treatingwith the skin protectant astringent product.Use of the term ``sunburn'' and the phrases ``A cleansing and drying agentto prepare the skin prior to the application of other medications for athlete'sfoot or hydrocortisone for rashes due to dermatitis and eczema'' and ``helpsto soften and remove crusts'' as suggested by the comment are not beingincluded in the revised indication because the comment did not provideany information or data to support these claims and no information on theseclaims has been submitted by any other interested person. The term ``crusts''is unclear and appears to be an inappropriate term for consumer labeling.The claims relating to ``cleansing'' and ``drying'' used alone would becosmetic claims and would not be subject to the monograph. These termscould appear outside of the indications section. Although the agency doesnot specifically prohibit commingled drug and cosmetic labeling separatefrom the indications section, the agency requests that such claims be appropriatelydescribed so that consumers will more readily be able to differentiatethe drug aspects from the cosmetic aspects of such labeling. If commingleddrug and cosmetic labeling claims are confusing or misleading, the agencymay determine that the product's labeling is misleading within the meaningof the act and declare the product misbranded under sections 502(a) and602(a) of the act.Finally, the agency is deleting that portion of the Panel's recommendedindication that reads ``swelling associated with minor bruises and ulcerationsof the skin.'' The Panel did not cite and the ageny is not aware of anydata that show that aluminum acetate reduces swelling. Further, the word``ulcerations'' is not a consumer term. In addition, the agency does notconsider a number of the conditions which the Panel discussed at 47 FR39427 and 39446, e.g., varicose ulcers, acute cutaneous inflammation, planterperforation ulcers, to be conditions which consumers should self-treatwithout a physician's supervision.Because there are a number of conditions that aluminum acetate may be usedfor and manufacturers may not wish to include all of these conditions intheir labeling, the agency is providing that manufacturers may select thoseconditions which they wish to include in the labeling for their product.Based on the above discussion, the revised indication proposed for aluminumacetate in this tentative final monograph reads as follows: ``For temporaryrelief of minor skin irritations due to'' (select one or more of the following:``poison ivy,'' ``poison oak,'' ``poison sumac,'' ``insect bites,'' ``athlete'sfoot,'' or ``rashes caused by soaps, detergents, cosmetics, or jewelry'').<ITAG tagnum="84">II. The Agency's Evaluation of a Submission </ITAG>9. Because the Panel inadvertently did not review a submission for theingredient aluminum chloride hexahydrate (Ref. 1), the agency has evaluatedthe submission. The submission contained information on a marketed productcontaining aluminum chloride hexahydrate labeled to help relieve inflammationoften associated with such common skin conditions as poison ivy, sunburn,athlete's foot, and insect bites. The product is marketed as a packet containing12.9 grams (g) of aluminum chloride hexahydrate crystals for dissolvingin approximately 12 ounces (oz) of water resulting in a 2-percent aluminumchloride solution for use as a wet dressing. The label states that a cleandressing or bandage soaked in the solution is to be applied loosely oninflamed skin and that such dressings are to be removed, remoistened, andreapplied every 10 to 15 minutes for 4 to 8 hours or as directed by a physician;the dressing should not be allowed to dry out; and the dressing materialand used solution should be discarded daily and not reused. The label alsocautions consumers that the product is for external use only; to avoidcontact with the eyes; and if irritation occurs or persists, discontinueuse and consult a physician. The submission contained a study by Leyden and Kligman (Ref. 2) who usedaluminum chloride hexahydrate as an astringent. The authors stated thatastringency cannot be precisely defined and probably encompasses multipleactions involving the alterations of protein's ability to swell and tohold water and the production of dryness. The study (Ref. 2) used proteinprecipitation as a criterion for astringent activity. To each 2-milliliter(mL) portion of a 4-percent bovine albumin solution, 2 mL of the followingwere added: 30 percent, 20 percent, and 10 percent aluminum chloride hexahydrate,30 percent aluminum acetate, 30 percent aluminum chlorohydrate, and 30percent aluminum sulfate. Readings were made at 5 minutes, at 1 hour, and24 hours. The 30 percent aluminum chloride hexahydrate solution produced a thickprecipitate within 5 minutes. With the 20 percent solution, there was turbidityat 5 minutes that became flocculent by 24 hours. The 10 percent solutionhad no effect. The 30 percent solutions of the other salts produced noprecipitation except for 30 percent aluminum chlorohydrate, which becameturbid in 24 hours. Aluminum chloride was the only salt tested that possessed protein-precipitatingproperties to a high degree. From these results, the authors stated thatone would expect aluminum chloride to be more drying than the other agentstested. Two general references (Refs. 3 and 4) contained in the submission citedthe use of aluminum chloride as an astringent at concentrations from 10to 25 percent but provided no supporting data. A textbook (Ref. 5) citedthe use of 2-percent aluminum chloride as an astringent and stated thatit is a rare sensitizer but provided no supporting data. The remainingreferences in the submission were general textbook references on the useof wet dressings and did not mention the use of aluminum chloride. Severalof the references describe the use of 1.5 to 2.5 percent aluminum chlorideas an antimicrobial; and one reference described a sensitization studyusing 10 percent aluminum chloride. The majority of the references haveno bearing on the effectiveness of aluminum chloride hexahydrate as anastringent. The agency reviewed the data submitted and concludes that they are insufficientto establish the effectiveness of aluminum chloride hexahydrate as an OTCastringent drug product for use as a wet dressing for relief of inflammatoryconditions. Because aluminum chloride is classified in Category I at 15 percent orless concentration (calculated as the hexahydrate form) in the tentativefinal monograph for OTC antiperspirant drug products in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of August 20, 1982 (47 FR 36504), the safetyof a 2-percent aluminum chloride solution has been established. Because some of the references in the submission are supportive of theeffectiveness of aluminum chloride hexahydrate as an astringent, the agencyis classifying this ingredient in Category III at this time. Additionaleffectiveness data will be needed to upgrade the ingredient to CategoryI at a 2-percent aluminum chloride concentration. The agency has not addressed specific guidelines for the testing of theeffectiveness of topically applied astringents in this document. In revisingthe OTC drug review procedures relating to Category III, published in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>of September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47730), the agencyadvised that tentative final monographs will not include recommended testingguidelines for conditions that industry wishes to upgrade to monographstatus. Instead, the agency will meet with industry representatives attheir request to discuss testing protocols. The revised procedures alsostate the time in which test data must be submitted for consideration indeveloping the final monograph.

Testing of Category II and Category III conditionsInterested persons may communicate with the agency about the submissionof data and information to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of anyastringent ingredient or condition included in the review by followingthe procedures outlined in the agency's policy statement published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47740), and clarifiedApril 1, 1983 (48 FR 14050). That policy statement includes proceduresfor the submission and review of proposed protocols, agency meetings withindustry or other interested persons, and agency communications on submittedtest data and other information.B. Summary of the Agency's Changes in the Panel's RecommendationsFDA has considered the comments and other relevant information and concludesthat it will tentatively adopt the Panel's report with the changes describedin FDA's responses to the comments above and with other changes describedin the summary below.1. The Panel had recommended directions for aluminum acetate as follows:the manufacturer must provide adequate directions so that the resultingsolution to be used by the consumer contains 2.5 to 5 percent aluminumacetate. The Panel also stated ``Based on the current literature and wideclinical usage, the Panel concludes that aluminum acetate solution 1:20to 1:40 is safe and effective for topical use as an astringent.'' (See47 FR 39428 and 39446.) The agency finds that the above two statements are somewhat inconsistent.Aluminum acetate solution, more commonly known as Burow's solution, isan approximately 5 percent solution of aluminum acetate (Ref. 1). As thePanel noted, aluminum acetate solution has been used for many years asan astringent by dilution with 10 to 40 parts of water as a wet dressing(47 FR 39427 and 39445). In diluting the 5 percent solution 1/40 to 1/10,the actual use concentration of aluminum acetate is 0.13 to 0.5 percent.Because this use concentration may be prepared by dilution of aluminumacetate solution or from tablet or powder concentrates, the agency is revisingandSection;347.12(a) to delete the percent of aluminum acetate recommendedby the Panel and is proposing that this section read as follows: ``Aluminumacetate, 0.13 to 0.5 percent (depending on the formulation and concentrationof the marketed product, the manufacturer must provide adequate directionsso that the resulting solution to be used by the consumer contains 0.13to 0.5 percent aluminum acetate).'' (See also comment 7 above.) Reference <ITAG tagnum="21">(1) ``United States Pharmacopeia XXI_National Formulary XVI,'' UnitedStates Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., Rockville, MD, p. 29, 1985.</ITAG>2. The agency is revising the indication for aluminum acetate. (See comment8 above.) 3. The agency is reclassifying aluminum sulfate 46 to 63 percent (basedon the anhydrous equivalent) for use as a styptic pencil from CategoryIII to Category I. (See comment 5 above.) 4. After reviewing a submission not reviewed by the Panel, the agency isclassifying aluminum chloride hexahydrate in Category III. (See comment9 above.) 5. The agency is classifying the combinations of an external analgesicand an astringent and a skin protectant and an astringent in Category IIIat this time. (See comment 3 above.) 6. The agency is clarifying the Panel's recommended name for witch hazeland is proposing the name ``Hamamelis water, NF XI'' as the only witchhazel active ingredient. (See comment 4 above.) In addition, the agencyis revising and combining the indications recommended for this ingredientby the Panel. The agency agrees with the Panel that hamamelis water maybe used for treating insect bites. However, the terms ``sunburn,'' ``bruises,''``contusions,'' and ``sprains'' as well as the claim ``for relieving muscularpains'' are not being included in the revised indication because the agencyis not aware of any data to support these claims. The claim for externalhemorrhoids is not being included in this rulemaking because the use ofhamamelis water for anorectal conditions, including external hemorrhoids,is more fully covered in the rulemaking for OTC anorectal drug products.More extensive indications for hamamelis water are proposed in andSection;346.50(b)of the tentative final monograph for OTC anorectal drug products. (Seethe <T4>Federal Register</T4> of August 15, 1988; 53 FR 30756.) Manufacturersmay label hamamelis water products with those claims and the claims proposedin this rulemaking provided the conditions of both monographs are fullymet. After combining and revising the remaining indications, the new indicationbeing proposed in andSection;347.52(b)(3) for hamamelis water reads as follows:``For temporary relief of minor skin irritations due to'' (select one ormore of the following: ``insect bites,'' ``minor cuts,'' or ``minor scrapes'').As stated above (see comment 8), the agency is providing that manufacturersmay select those conditions which they wish to include in the labelingfor their product. The agency considers this revised indication to be moreconsistent with the indications proposed by the agency for OTC skin protectantdrug products in andSection;347.50(b) of the tentative final monograph forOTC skin protectant drug products (48 FR 6832) and with the definitionof an astringent being proposed in this document. (See paragraph 7 below.)7. The agency is changing the Panel's recommended definition for an astringentdrug to be consistent with the definition proposed in the tentative finalmonograph for OTC anorectal drug products in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of (53 FR 30781). The revised definition is as follows: ``A drug that is applied to the skinor mucous membranes for a local and limited protein coagulant effect.''8. In an effort to simplify OTC drug labeling, the agency proposed in anumber of tentative final monographs to substitute the word ``doctor''for ``physician'' in OTC drug monographs on the basis that the word ``doctor''is more commonly used and better understood by consumers. Based on commentsto these proposals, the agency has determined that final monographs andany applicable OTC drug regulation will give manufacturers the option ofusing either the word ``physician'' or the word ``doctor.'' This tentativefinal monograph proposes that option. (See andSection;347.52(c)(1)(i).)9. The agency is not including in the tentative final monograph the Panel'srecommended warning for aluminum acetate to ``store in a cool dry place.''The official compendium does not require such a storage condition for theonly official aluminum acetate product, aluminum acetate topical solution(Ref. 1). Manufacturers of powder or tablet products containing aluminumacetate may include such a statement in the labeling of their productsif they determine this type of storage is necessary to preserve the stabilityof the product. However, such a statement will not be a monograph requirement.Reference <ITAG tagnum="21">(1) ``The United States Pharmacopeia XXI_The National Formulary XVI,''United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., Rockville, MD, p. 29, 1985.</ITAG>10. The agency is revising and combining the warnings recommended by thePanel to be consistent with the format and style of other tentative finalmonographs. In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 1, 1986 (51 FR 16258), the agency publisheda final rule changing its labeling policy for stating the indications foruse of OTC drug products. Under 21 CFR 330.1(c)(2), the label and labelingof OTC drug products are required to contain in a prominent and conspicuouslocation, either (1) the specific wording on indications for use establishedunder an OTC drug monograph, which may appear within a boxed area designated``APPROVED USES''; (2) other wording describing such indications for usethat meets the statutory prohibitions against false or misleading labeling,which shall neither appear within a boxed area nor be designated ``APPROVEDUSES''; or (3) the approved monograph language on indications, which mayappear within a boxed area designated ``APPROVED USES,'' plus alternativelanguage describing indications for use that is not false or misleading,which shall appear elsewhere in the labeling. All other OTC drug labelingrequired by a monograph or other regulation (e.g., statement of indentity,warnings, and directions) must appear in the specific wording establishedunder the OTC drug monograph or other regulation where exact language hasbeen established and identified by quotation marks, e.g., 21 CFR 201.63or 330.1(g). The proposed rule in this document is subject to the labelingprovisions in andSection;330.1(c)(2). The agency has examined the economic consequences of this proposed rulemakingin conjunction with other rules resulting from the OTC drug review. Ina notice published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5806), the agencyannounced the availability of an assessment of these economic impacts.The assessment determined that the combined impacts of all the rules resultingfrom the OTC drug review do not constitute a major rule according to thecriteria established by Executive Order 12291. The agency therefore concludesthat no one of these rules, including this proposed rule for OTC externalanalgesic and skin protectant drug products used as an astringent, is amajor rule. The economic assessment also concluded that the overall OTC drug reviewwas not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, PublicLaw 96-354. That assessment included a discretionary Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis in the event that an individual rule might impose an unusual ordisproportionate impact on small entities. However, this particular rulemakingfor OTC external analgesic and skin protectant drug products used as anastringent is not expected to pose such an impact on small businesses.Therefore, the agency certifies that this proposed rule, if implemented,will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. The agency invites public comment regarding any substantial or significanteconomic impact that this rulemaking would have on OTC skin protectantdrug products when used as an astringent. Types of impact may include,but are not limited to, costs associated with product testing, relabeling,repackaging, or reformulating. Comments regarding the impact of this rulemakingon OTC skin protectant drug products when used as an astringent shouldbe accompanied by appropriate documentation. Because the agency has notpreviously invited specific comment on the economic impact of the OTC drugreview on external analgesic and skin protectant drug products used asan astringent, a period of 120 days from the date of publication of thisproposed rulemaking in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> will be provided for comments on this subectto be developed and submitted. The agency will evaluate any comments andsupporting data that are received and will reassess the economic impactof this rulemaking in the preamble to the final rule. The agency invited public comment in the advance notice of proposed rulemakingregarding any impact that this rulemaking would have on OTC external analgesicand skin protectant drug products used as an astringent. No comments oneconomic impacts were received. Any comments on the agency's initial determinationof the economic consequences of this proposed rulemaking should be submittedby August 1, 1989. The agency will evaluate any comments and supportingdata that are received and will reassess the economic impact of this rulemakingin the preamble to the final rule.The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action isof a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significantimpact on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact statement is required.Because the rulemakings for the external analgesic and skin protectantuses of OTC astringent drug products have been combined and are being proposedas part of the tentative final monograph for OTC skin protectant drug products(see 21 CFR Part 347 as proposed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 15, 1983; 48 FR 6820), the agencyis removing in their entirety all paragraphs related to the external analgesicuse of astringents that were included in the advance notice of proposedrulemaking for OTC external analgesic drug products. The paragraphs removed,which appeared in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 7, 1982 (47 FR at 39432 and 39433),are andSection; 348.3(h), andSection; 348.10(c), and andSection; 348.50(a)(3),(b) (4) and (5), (c) (7) and (8), and (d)(2) (i) and (ii).Interested persons may, on or before June 2, 1989, submit to the DocketsManagement Branch (address above), written comments, objections, or requestsfor oral hearing before the Commissioner on the proposed rulemaking. Arequest for an oral hearing must specify points to be covered and timerequested. Written comments on the agency's economic impact determinationmay be submitted on or before August 1, 1989. Three copies of all comments,objections, and requests are to be submitted, except that individuals maysubmit one copy. Comments, objections, and requests are to be identifiedwith the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this documentand may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or brief. Comments, objections,and requests may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,Monday through Friday. Any scheduled oral hearing will be announced inthe <T4>Federal Register.</T4>Interested persons, on or before April 3, 1990, may also submit in writingnew data demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of those conditionsnot classified in Category I.
