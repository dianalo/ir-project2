Public focus thus far has centered on state legislatures,Congress and the Supreme Court. But the role of state courts wasdramatically underscored on Oct. 5, when the Florida Supreme Courtruled that the state constitution gives women a right to abortion.   As a result, women in Florida would be unaffected if thenation's highest court some day reverses its landmark 1973 decisionand says the federal Constitution does not provide the right toabortion.   If the Florida Legislature merely passed a law criminalizingabortions, the state Supreme Court surely would overturn it.Anti-abortion activists instead would have to try to amend thestate constitution, an involved process not undertaken successfullysince 1968.   A state may never give its citizens fewer rights than thoseguaranteed by the federal Constitution, but it is free to providegreater rights. And the ultimate interpreter of each state'sconstitution is not the U.S. Supreme Court but that state's highestcourt.   For example, although governmental refusals to fund abortionsfor women on welfare have survived attacks based on the federalConstitution, such refusals were ruled invalid under theconstitutions of California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jerseyand Vermont.   The Florida court's broad ruling was not unprecedented. TheCalifornia Supreme Court years ago found an abortion right in itsstate's constitution.   Both state courts based their decisions on explicit statementsguaranteeing the right of privacy. Although no other court hasruled directly on a right to abortion, at least five other stateconstitutions _ those of Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Louisiana andMontana _ provide a right of privacy.   In a few other states, most notably New Jersey andMassachusetts, rulings by the highest court have implied a stateprivacy right that could include the right to abortion.   ``We have studied those state constitutions and are looking atthe makeup of the highest court in each of those states,'' saidDawn Johnsen, legal director of the National Abortion Rights ActionLeague.   Part of the abortion rights strategy will be to ask state, notfederal, courts to overturn new restrictive laws based on stateconstitutional grounds.   Mary Spaulding of the National Right to Life Committee says herorganization began to focus on state constitutions long before theFlorida ruling.   ``This battle will be in the states, and state court rulings ontheir constitutions therefore are included,'' she said. ``We knowwe have a problem in some states, and we are studying the matter.''   In those states in which there is no state constitutional rightof privacy, challenges to restrictive abortion laws might be basedon such legal notions as liberty, due process, equal protection andsexual equality.   Such moves likely will be accompanied by efforts, on both sidesof the fight, to amend state constitutions and to reshape thememberships of state legislatures and high courts.   Patricia Ireland of the National Organization for Women saysgetting more abortion rights supporters appointed to state highcourts must be made part of ``the feminization of power'' her groupseeks.   ``State courts are part of the political package we are lookingat,'' she said. ``They are present and future arenas.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITORS' NOTE: Richard Carelli has covered the Supreme Court andlegal affairs for The Associated Press since 1976.</TEXT></DOC>
