Mr. Reagan, speaking at his first White House news conference in more than seven months, said he remains opposed to any &quot;tax that will have a deleterious effect on the economy,&quot; and he said he would be particularly reluctant to accept any increases in personal income taxes.    Although the president didn't say so explicitly, others in the administration have suggested that they might consider &quot;sin taxes,&quot; such as levies on alcohol and tobacco, and other excise taxes.    But he stressed that he wouldn't say beforehand what he might accept in negotiations. And in another gesture to calm financial markets worried about the course of the federal deficit, he said he would launch the budget negotiations by meeting with congressional leaders rather than waiting until later in the process to become directly involved.    &quot;I'm putting everything on the table with the exception of Social Security, with no other preconditions, and I call on the leaders of Congress to do the same,&quot; the president said.    Mr. Reagan also offered some good news about the fiscal 1987 budget deficit that White House officials hoped might help stabilize international markets. He said that the deficit shrank $73 billion -- from $221 billion in fiscal 1986 -- to $148 billion in the year ended last Sept. 30. The narrowing was larger than anticipated.    While much of the narrowing stemmed from a one-time boost in revenue as the new tax bill took effect this year, the White House emphasized that it also reflected reduced federal spending.    In another confidence-building effort, Mr. Reagan said he was appointing a new task force headed by former Sen. Nicholas Brady, chairman of Dillon, Read andamp; Co., to examine stock market procedures and recommend possible changes to the president within the next two months.    Unlike some previous news conferences, this nationally televised session found Mr. Reagan performing smoothly, although he did confuse Secretary of State George Shultz with the secretary general of the United Nations.    Congressional leaders had complained that Mr. Reagan was sending mixed signals about whether he would be involved personally in the budget-deficit negotiations and whether he would be willing to consider raising taxes.    Last night, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) praised the president's &quot;considerable courage and statesmanship&quot; and said he was &quot;encouraged&quot; by the news conference. &quot;By his answers tonight, the president indicated to me that he is flexible and that he sincerely wants to negotiate and achieve a package we can all support,&quot; Sen. Byrd said.    Mr. Reagan emphasized that he prefers to raise government revenue by enacting $22 billion in previous administration proposals, which are mostly user fees and other non-tax measures. He repeatedly refused to be drawn into more specific discussion of a possible tax boost, although he made clear that some taxes might be more acceptable to him than an income tax increase.    &quot;There are some taxes such as the income tax that have a more definite effect on the economy than some other taxes,&quot; Mr. Reagan said. &quot;But I am not going to discuss anymore what we are going to do&quot; once negotiations begin.    Indeed, the president's presentation last night suggests that the administration has established a strategy for the coming negotiations, in which it will remain publicly opposed to taxes that it says hurt the economy while implicitly leaving the way open for increases it can claim don't have that effect. Mr. Reagan stuck to that line in the face of repeated questioning, indicating he'd been well-prepared to stick with that approach.    Pressed about his previous promises to veto any tax increase that reaches his desk, Mr. Reagan squirmed a bit and explained that he still thinks &quot;taxing is something -- well, I think it's what brought on the troubles that we had when -- when I came here.&quot; But he stuck to his line that he was going to remain flexible for the negotiations. &quot;You're all trying to get me into saying what I am going to do when I sit down at the table with the other fellows, and I'm going to tell you that I'm going to do what I think is absolutely necessary for the economy of the United States,&quot; the president said.    Mr. Reagan said the stock market slide &quot;was a long-overdue correction,&quot; and he added that &quot;what factors led to its kind of getting into the panic stage, I don't know. But we'll be watching it very closely.&quot;    Answering one of last night's few foreign-policy questions, Mr. Reagan said the U.S. will continue responding militarily to Iranian attacks. He warned that the Ayatollah Khomeini was &quot;running a great risk because we're going to respond. We're not going to sit there.&quot; But he also stressed that &quot;we're not there to start a war,&quot; and he added that he didn't see such actions as this week's American retaliatory attack on Iranian offshore military platforms as &quot;leading to a war or anything else.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
