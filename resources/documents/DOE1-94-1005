It is designedto serve as a supporting component and as the containment of the reactorcore, and in addition has the function of gas flow control and neutronphysical shielding. The external and internal layers therefore are differentin design, with only the external wall serving as the supporting structure.The whole design of the reflector is determined by the specific propertiesof graphite, and by the irradiation effects on graphite.</TEXT></DOC>
