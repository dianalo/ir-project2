National, closed yesterday by regulators, is to reopen tomorrow as a branch of First National. The FDIC arranged the deposit transfer after the agency received no bids for the failed bank's purchase.    National had assets totaling $24.8 million and held deposits of $23.3 million in 3,500 accounts, including $260,000 in 38 accounts that exceeded the federal insurance limit of $100,000. Holders of those accounts will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds from the liquidation of National's assets.    First National agreed to pay the FDIC an $11,000 premium for the right to receive the deposits, and agreed to purchase loans and other assets of the failed bank for $14.6 million.    National was the ninth U.S. bank to fail this year, the fourth in Oklahoma. </TEXT></DOC>
