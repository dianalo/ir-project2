This year, 20,162 Soviet Jews have been allowed to leave thecountry, the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration said,compared with a 1988 total of 20,082 _ the highest outflow since1980.   In June, 3,965 emigres arrived in Vienna, the second-highesttotal this year after April. Of these, 89 decided to go to Israel,said committee spokeswoman Regina Boucault.   Only 613 emigrants _ 3 percent of the total _ have chosen toresettle in Israel this year, she said. Most are going to the UnitedStates.   Emigration has soared to twice last year's rate, a move seenpartly as a Soviet effort to improve ties with Israel.   About 300,000 Soviet Jews have emigrated since the resettlementprogram began in 1971. The largest official exodus, 51,328, wasrecorded in 1979, before the Soviet intervention in Afghanistanchilled East-West relations.   Between 1971 and 1978, more than three quarters of all emigrantssettled in Israel. In the past three years, the share fell to aboutone quarter before taking a new plunge last year when Israel facedmounting economic problems and a Palestinian uprising in theoccupied territories.</TEXT></DOC>
