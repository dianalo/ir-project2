Also Friday, two people were killed 85 miles northeast ofManagua but versions differed as to whether it was an attack byU.S.-backed Contras on Sandinista supporters or a holdup.   Antonio Lacayo, campaign manager for the United NationalOpposition (UNO), predicted his coalition will win the Feb. 25election by 15 percent over the Sandinistas.   But Lacayo, son-in-law of the group's presidential candidateVioleta Barrios de Chamorro, said that in the ``remote chance of aSandinista victory'' the coalition would be willing to accept it,provided international observers declared the elections free andfair.   ``If the majority decides the next government should be one ofthe Sandinista Front, I believe that we at UNO will respect theresults. Dona Violeta has said so very clearly; this isdemocracy,'' he told a news conference.   Lacayo also dismissed an exchange of threats between thecoalition's vice presidential candidate, Virgilio Godoy, andPresident Daniel Ortega, calling them simply ``campaign speeches.''   Ortega had demanded an explanation of statements Godoy made inspeeches that the coalition was going to ``make the Sandinistaspay'' after the elections. In campaign speeches, Ortega _ who isseeking reelection for a six-year term _ returned the threat.   He said that if his Sandinistas win, they will shut down Mrs.Chamorro's newspaper, La Prensa, and confiscate her house and thatof Godoy's.   ``UNO, in its government program ... emphasizes nationalreconciliation ... and is completely incompatible with makinganybody pay,'' Lacayo said.   Ortega said in the town of Boaco that Contra rebels attackedSandinista supporters on their way a campaign rally there. ``Butthe people, without weapons ... jumped on them and stoned them,''he said.   Ortega's was the third version so far of the incident 3 milesoutside Juigalpa at around 7:30 a.m. Friday.   Carlos Jose Estrada, who said he witnessed the incident, saidtwo Contras in camouflage uniform and carrying AK-47 rifles stoppedtwo pickup trucks carrying Sandinistas to the rally.   He said one passenger, identified as Armengor Espinoza, shot andkilled one Contra; the other Contra returned fire and killedEspinoza and wounded another passenger.   But the receptionist at the Camilo Ortega Hospital in Juigalpa,where all victims were taken, said the attackers were maskedhighway robbers, not Contras.   Defense and Interior ministry spokesmen in Managua said they hadno information on the attack other than what they heard on theradio, and repeated telephone calls to police in Juigalpa did notget through.</TEXT></DOC>
