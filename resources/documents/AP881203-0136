Alfonsin went on national television after government troopsallowed hundreds of mutinous, heavily armed soldiers to leave aninfantry school they had seized and move to another military base.   Alfonsin told the nation that he has ordered the army to``suffocate'' the rebellion. Argentine news agencies later reportedheavy troop movements, which they interpreted as preparations byloyalist forces to end the rebellion.   Local news agencies said scores of angry civilians hurled rocksat the military compound where the rebels were holed up about 12miles outside of Buenos Aires, and that the rebels responded withtear gas and shots fired into the air.   The leader of the rebels, Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, insisted ina statement read to reporters by a subordinate that his rebellion``lacks political motivation and was initiated for militaryreasons.''   The country's democratic institutions ``are not in danger,'' itsaid.   The mutinous soldiers began their revolt Thursday to protest thecriminal trials of officers who have been charged with committinghuman rights abuses during the military dictatorships that ruled thecountry from 1976-83.   Alfonsin described the revolt as a ``seditious attempt'' against``well-being, tolerance and liberty.'' He assured citizens that therevolt ``does not endanger the republic nor the ... constitution.''   The government broadcast repeated pleas on national televisionSaturday for citizens to rally for democracy. Thousands of peoplewere reportedly gathering in streets and squares nationwide,including about 5,000 in Buenos Aires.   Several ambassadors arrived at the Congress building in BuenosAires, including Theodore Gildred of the United States. ``We arehere to lend our complete solidarity to the consolidation ofdemocracy,'' Gildred said.   The U.S. Embassy issued a statement that said President Reaganand President-elect George Bush sent ``their firm and unwaveringsupport'' for Argentine democracy.   Alfonsin met with aides and Cabinet members Saturday in theheavily guarded Government House. Congress also met in an emergencysession on Saturday.   Congressman Cesar Jaroslavsky of Alfonsin's governing CivicRadical Union Party called on citizens to ``go into the street todefend democracy.''   ``This is the moment,'' Jaroslavsky said.   He acknowledged that loyal armed forces members ``have not beenable to dominate the rebels.''   Juan Carlos Pugliese, president of the House of Deputies, said``Democracy is in danger,'' and called the insurrection ``a clearcoup attempt.''   The insurrection began Thursday when about 400 soldiers desertedtheir posts under the leadership of the charismatic Seineldin.   The group, joined later by about 50 coast guard members, seizedan infantry school Friday morning at the giant Campo de Mayomilitary base 22 miles northwest of the capital.   Government forces surrounded the base and exchanged severalrounds of mortar and rifle fire with rebels Friday, during whichfour people were wounded, the army said Saturday.   News reports said one person was killed, but there was noofficial confirmation.   On Saturday, the rebels left the base. Government forces did notfire on the rebels, the official news agency Telam said. It said therebels drove past government troops aboard several trucks loadedwith weapons and ammunition.   Telam said the rebels arrived later at a motorized military unitin Villa Martelli about eight miles away. The unit's officersearlier had been reported as sympathizing with the rebels.   The rebels fortified their positions and set up snipers. At leastsix tanks were seen.   Several explosions were heard outside the base late Saturdaynight, the private news agencies Noticias Argentinas and Diarios yNoticias reported. Telam said lights at the base went out shortlyafterward.   More than 100 area residents showed their opposition to therebels by shouting insults and stoning a car as it entered the baseand rebels responded with tear gas, the reports said.   Presidential spokesman Jose Ignacio Lopez acknowleged Saturdaythat Cabinet ministers and military chiefs meeting at GovernmentHouse were ``nervous,'' and noted the presidential guard was beingreinforced.   ``If a group of rebels moves from one place to another and youdon't know where they're going, the least you have to do to protectthe president is reinforce the guard,'' he said.   Military uprisings in 1987 and in January were led by Lt. Col.Aldo Rico, now discharged and imprisoned. They were called tosupport fellow officers being prosecuted in civilian courts forhuman rights abuses during the dark days of Argentina's militarydictatorships.   During the dictatorships, at least 9,000 Argentines``disappeared'' and were presumed executed by security forces.   In December 1985, five former junta members, including formermilitary presidents Jorge Videla and Roberto Viola, were convictedin civilian court for crimes including kidnapping, torture andmurder.
