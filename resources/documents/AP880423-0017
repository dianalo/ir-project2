Going into the final weekend before Pennsylvania's primaryTuesday, the two surviving Democratic hopefuls found little todisagree about in their first head-to-head debate Friday night inPhiladelphia.   ``Any combination on this stage against George Bush ... willbeat the Republicans in November,'' said civil rights leaderJackson.   ``The two remaining _ and I guess that makes us the leading _candidates for the Democratic nomination are the son of immigrantsfrom Massachusetts and a black man who grew up poor in SouthCarolina,'' the Massachusetts governor told the hour-long debate inPhiladelphia. ``I think that says everything there is to say abouthis country.''   Bush, his nomination victory well in hand, spent Friday fishingin Florida.   Both Democrats headed back out across Pennsylvania today,looking for votes in the Tuesday balloting with 178 delegates atstake. A second debate was scheduled tonight in Pittsburgh.   The good humor of the debate sponsored by the PennsylvaniaDemocratic party stood in sharp contrast to the harsh racial andreligious overtones of the New York primary only a week ago.   Jackson insisted it is a close race for the Democraticnomination, but Dukakis is firmly in the front-runner's spot with awidening lead in the national delegate battle and a substantialedge in the polls for the Pennsylvania primary.   Who will fill the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket occupiedmuch of the debate. It has also dominated the Democratic campaignsince Dukakis won his big New York victory to become the odds-onfavorite to win the presidential nomination at the party conventionin Atlanta in July.   ``It's a bit premature to be giving out coronation roses for thegovernor and taps for me,'' Jackson said when asked if he wouldaccept the No. 2 spot. ``We're now moving into the last lap of asignificant race, and I'm a long-distance runner. I look forward toit.''   Dukakis, who has denied even thinking about a running mate, thenturned to Jackson and asked softly:   ``Are you interested?''   After the audience's laughter subsided, Jackson smiled andreplied, ``You got it, Mike.''   Dukakis had a curt response to a question of whether he believedpolls showing Jackson as the vice presidential nominee would costDemocrats the White House in the fall elections: ``No.''   Jackson drew his share of laughter as well, in response to aquestion about how the Democrats could win the South in the generalelection.   ``Mike Dukakis on my ticket will win the South,'' thepreacher-turned-politician said.   The only harsh words of the day were directed at Republicans.   ``First of all, the drug program of the Reagan administration isto have the First Lady to say `Just say no,' the president to justcut the budget, and Mr. Bush to just say and do nothing,'' Jacksonsaid during the debate.   Earlier, Dukakis said Bush fails to understand what it takes to``build an economic future and to create good jobs.''   ``I don't see how we are going to bring good jobs and good wagesback to the industrial Midwest unless we work together,'' Dukakissaid in Toledo. ``If the vice president doesn't understand that,then he shouldn't be running for president.''   Both men told reporters after the debate that keeping the focuson winning in the fall was the correct course.   The only differences between the two in the debate were notmajor ones.   Dukakis praised plant-closing legislation, saying he had used astate law like the one now before Congress to save thousands ofjobs in Massachusetts.   Jackson said reinvesting in the nation is more important.   He also pressed Dukakis seriously on South Africa, suggestingthat Dukakis's strong stand against terrorism should be applied tothat nation and its ``state-sponsored terrorism.''   ``I would be very tough on South Africa,'' the Massachusettsgovernor replied.</TEXT></DOC>
