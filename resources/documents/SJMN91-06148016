Father Mario ledearly but finished seventh. Mario's nephew, John, finished fifth. Mario'syoungest son, the rookie Jeff, finished 15th.;    Mario was upset afterwardabout being penalized during the race. &quot;They said in the drivers' meeting theonly penalty for driving under the yellow line in turn four is if you'redriving down there by yourself,&quot; Mario said.;    &quot;I had to go for evasiveaction in traffic. What am I going to do -- hit the cars? That's what theycall a penalty?&quot;;    Mario thus continues to be star-crossed at Indy. In the1981 race, he crossed the finish line second to Bobby Unser. The followingday, he was proclaimed the winner because of a one-lap penalty on Unser, but aruling five months later restored Unser's victory.;  LEWIS 14TH: Randy Lewisof Hillsborough finished 14th, matching his best previous Indy finish.;   Lewis had a long day, spending almost 25 minutes in the pits with variousmechanical problems. They included a broken fuel-hose clamp and a stuckthrottle linkage.;    &quot;After all of that,&quot; Lewis said, &quot;I knew I wasn't goingto make 40 laps on the leaders, so I put the car in sixth gear and did thebest I could, trying to finish the race.&quot;;  COGAN INJURED: The only seriousincident on the day came on lap 24 when Kevin Cogan and Roberto Guerrerotangled in the first turn and both cars slammed into the outside wall.;   Guerrero, with only a bruised shoulder, jumped right out of his battered car,but Cogan had to be removed by safety personnel and later underwent surgery ona fractured upper right arm, right forearm and right thigh.;  ETC.: Two-timeIndy champion Gordon Johncock, 54, who was summoned out of retirement twoweeks ago when Ron Hemelgarn and Jonathan Byrd decided to put Stan Fox'sbackup car in the race, finished sixth. . . .
