King World, a television programming distributor, said in New York that it has no immediate plans to start another tender offer. &quot;Right now, the board has decided to buy the shares that were tendered and adopt a wait-and-see attitude,&quot; said Stuart Hersch, chief operating officer. The company has 30.2 million shares outstanding.    King World initiated the $28-a-share tender offer last month, at a time when shares were trading at slightly more than $24 a share. However, during the two days before the offer expired, at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday, the price of the company's shares rose above the tender offer price. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, King World gained 50 cents, closing at $29.    Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer andamp; Co., said he believes so few shares were tendered because the stock's value is substantially greater than the offering price. Mr. Hersch said the small response to the offer &quot;is a great show of faith in the long-term prospects of the company.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
