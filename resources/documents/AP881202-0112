He was arrested in Tennessee, sacked inCalifornia and 25 red-suited Kris Kringles scared the wits out ofchildren with their chorus of ho-ho-hos. And there are still 22shopping days left till Christmas.   Parents in Seattle weren't too happy with Santa, either, after aTV program urged children to hold a phone near the set fortone-activated dialing of calls to the North Pole _ at $2 for thefirst minute and 30 cents thereafter.   In Nashville, Tenn., a misunderstanding over a bill for $360 ledto the arrests of two stretch limousines full of Santas who weretaking toys to children at hospitals and agencies for the poor.   ``We had Santa suits on, no pockets, no money, no checks, noID,'' said Vernon Frank Minow, who organized the Santa task force.Minow said he arranged to rent one limo Wednesday and the AAA MusicCity Limousine Service donated a second but demanded $360 for thecars before all the deliveries were made.   ``In my 17 years as a policeman, this is the first time I'vearrested Santa Claus,'' said burglary detective Gary Mallory.   Minow threatened Thursday to sue ``all those involved trying tostop the good works for the children.''   Limousine company spokesman Mark Fisher declined comment.   Newly graduated Santas in Chicago got some final lessonsWednesday _ including that more isn't always merrier.   The 25 red-suited, black-booted Kris Kringles invaded a downtownhotel lobby expecting cheers and laughter. But the sight of so manyof them at once brought out tears, and children ran to their mothers.   ``I really love kids, but I didn't realize they'd be so scared,''said Chris Davis, 19, of San Diego. ``I reached out to shake one'shand and she started crying.''   Veteran Santa Leonard Utecht, 68, with 48 years behind the beard,used the incident to teach the new dogs old tricks.   ``Don't reach down to the little ones from above or they'llretreat,'' he said. ``If you stoop to their level, you can win themover.''   Utecht's basic rules for Santas: Know all the reindeers' names.Don't make any specific promises. And gently hold the child's hand _it's soothing and keeps the little dickens from grabbing the beard.   He might have added one: Don't make it too easy to call the NorthPole.   Only 10 minutes into a half-hour TV program called ``Here ComesSanta,'' angry parents began calling KTZZ-TV in Seattle on Thursdaycomplaining that their children were urged to hold the phone nearthe TV set. Electronic tones automatically dialed a call to SantaClaus.   After receiving the calls from parents, program director DanLutgen ordered that the words ``ask your parents'' be showncontinuously. Under the station's contract, the production company,Phone Quest, must reimburse parents for calls made without theirpermission, Lutgen said.   Nancy Bernstrom of US West, the local phone company, said shecould not release figures on the number of calls placed during theprogram.   Santa also was the at the center of a storm in Carson, Calif.   The NAACP threatened a boycott of a Carson shopping mall where anemployee allegedly made a racist remark about a black Santa Claus.   The protest was sparked by the firing of Rodney Newton as themall's Santa Claus and a remark a mall official allegedly made tohim that ``there is no such thing as a black Santa Claus,''according to NAACP spokeswoman Ruth Anderson.   On Friday, the mall and officials from the National Associationfor the Advancement of Colored People reached an agreement callingfor the firing of the mall employee, suspension of a supervisor anda public apology.   Mall owner Mark McGaughey had said race was not a factor, notinga second black Santa was quickly hired. Newton was fired because hewas too big for a disappearing act in a holiday program stunt,McGaughey said.</TEXT></DOC>
