Korner III.``And by the Hunts I mean Bunker, Herbert and me. And they wantedto control all of the operations of the Hunts.''   Lamar and his other brothers, Nelson Bunker and William Herbert,are in U.S. Tax Court contesting a total of more than $300 millionin taxes the Internal Revenue Services says is owed from the 1982dissolution of a partnership set up to repay their debts aftersilver price collapse.   Under the partnership agreement, the family's Placid Oil Co.contributed $824 million of a $1.1 billion loan it obtained from aconsortium of banks. Under a Federal Reserve directive at the time,banks were not allowed to lend on silver investments.   The brothers in turn contributed silver, gold stocks, and coalproperties in North Dakota.   Lamar testified the banks insisted he be included in thepartnership with his brothers, as well as serve as a guarantor,although he said he had no outstanding bank debts on silver at thetime.   ``The banks were insisting I be in the partnership,'' Lamarsaid. ``The banks wanted to put their arms now only around Herbertand Bunker but they wanted to put their arms around me ... and thatwas the way it was presented to me.   ``I was told the banks were dictating the wording and the termsof the agreement,'' Hunt said.   Asked if he had pledged all his assets, including his Rolexwatch, Hunt said: ``Yes, the famous watch.''   Bunker testified last week that the banks had demanded ascollateral ``paintings on the wall'' and his brother's Rolex.   Bunker and Herbert each are contesting more than $150 million in1982 taxes, while Lamar is contesting $505,377 in taxes.   Lamar said he lost about $15 million on his silver investments,which began in 1974. At the height of his silver investing, Huntsaid he had 1,600 futures contracts, each for 5,000 ounces ofsilver.   Lamar, like Bunker, blamed restrictions on silver investors bythe commodities markets for the silver price collapse.   In a pending case however, the Commodity Futures TradingCommission has accused Bunker and Herbert of attempting to cornerthe silver market. It says they owned one-third of the world'ssilver bullion when prices collapsed. A jury in New York last yearfound Bunker, Herbert and two others had conspired to manipulateand monopolize the silver market and defraud investors.   The two ex-billionaires now owe $250 million in fines andinterest in that lawsuit, brought by Minpeco, the Peruvian silvermining company.</TEXT></DOC>
