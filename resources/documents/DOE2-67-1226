<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-67-1226 </DOCNO><TEXT>The seismic stratigraphy and geological structure of the continental marginof the Dumont d'Urville Sea off Wilkes Land, near the 140{sup 0}E meridian,are interpreted based on the authors' marine geological and geophysicalsurvey (TH82) in the 1982-1983 Antarctic summer season. Two sedimentaryunits are observed in the continental rise of this area. The upper unit(sequences DS-2, DS-3, and DS-4) is undeformed and well stratified, andprobably represents the post-breakup marine Tertiary sequence. The maximumthickness is 2.0 sec (two-way travel time) in the center of the continentalrise. The unit onlaps the lower one in the outer marginal high and innercontinental slope side of the rise. The lower unit (sequences DS-5 andDS-6) is slightly deformed and poorly stratified. This unit is believedto be Cretaceous pre-breakup nonmarine to shallow-marine intracontinentalsediments. Maximum thickness of the unit is 3.0 sec in the outer marginalhigh of the rise. The authors' interpreted tectonic history of the areais summarized as follows: Crustal extension and igneous intrusion occurredand made a broad inland prerift basin in East Gondwanaland during themid-Mesozoic. Thick lacustrine, deltaic, and shallow-marine sedimentarysequences of the lower unit were deposited in the rift basin. Rapid regionalsubsidence of the rift graben occurred after the uplift of the centralpart of the rift basin (at present, the outer margin of the rise). Thissubsidence was caused by the initiation of breakup of East Gondwanalandand the seafloor spreading between Antarctica and Australia in the earlyPaleogene. After the breakup, thick marine sedimentary sequences of theupper unit filled the tectonically stable sedimentary basin of the continentalrise.</TEXT></DOC>
