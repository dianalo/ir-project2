Air Wis Services, the Appleton, Wis., parent of AirWisconsin, said the AMR Corp. unit has made an &quot;expression ofits interest in entering into an acquisition transaction.&quot;Air Wis said that American would not formulate terms until adue diligence review is completed.</LP><TEXT>   American's interest in Air Wis, which controls 168valuable slots at crowded O'Hare International Airport inChicago, could turn up the heat at United. Based in Chicago,United last month agreed to acquire Air Wis for cash andstock then valued at $8.04 a share, or $72.7 million. United,a unit of UAL Corp., then subsequently loaned Air Wis $10million to alleviate its strained cash position.   In disclosing American's overture, Air Wis said it will&quot;explore any timely specific proposal that may be made byAmerican.&quot; Officials at American declined to comment.   Late last year, Air Wis managed to get a sweetenedfinancial arrangement as a United Express affiliate, whenrumors spread that American might forge an affiliateagreement with the commuter.   An Air Wis spokesman said that the airline did not solicitAmerican's interest. In fact, absent a timely concreteproposal from American or any other interested suitor, AirWis said it will proceed with plans to ask stockholders toapprove the acquisition by UAL. An Air Wis stockholder'smeeting is scheduled for Dec. 9 to vote on the UAL proposal.   United said late yesterday that it's proceeding with thesteps necessary to complete its proposed purchase of Air Wis.In a statement, United said it doesn't view American as aviable alternative for Air Wisconsin.   United cited Air Wisconsin's deteriorating financialsituation, as well as &quot;time requirements for any othertransaction and regulatory constraints,&quot; an apparentsuggestion that an American-Air Wis pact could face antitrustproblems. United described American as Air Wisconsin's&quot;primary&quot; commuter rival in Chicago.</TEXT></DOC>
