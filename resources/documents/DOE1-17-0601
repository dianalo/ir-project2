<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-17-0601 </DOCNO><TEXT>We present a theoretical analysis of a newly demonstrated semiconductorlaser with coupled distributed feedback and Fabry--Perot (DFB-FP) cavitiesand show that three modes of operation are possible for such a laser.In mode-switched DFB mode, the wavelength can be switched between longitudinalmodes on either side of the stopband. In coupled-cavity laser mode, thereare successive mode hops inside the stopband. Finally, in continuouslytunable distributed Bragg reflector mode, a wide wavelength tuning range(4.8 A) without mode hopping can be obtained. The analysis is generalenough to be applied to any laser with a periodic waveguide section,and provides an understanding of the mechanisms and the limits of wavelengthtuning in such lasers. This type of laser has very important applicationsin coherent optical communications.</TEXT></DOC>
