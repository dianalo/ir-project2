President E. Robert Ferguson remembers the good ol' days, when a construction company like his could get a state contract just by submitting the lowest bid.    Times have changed, and now a contractor can be aced out of the competition by any number of &quot;procedural errors,&quot; explains Mr. Ferguson.    Kasler found that out the hard way, as it was passed over recently for a project by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California to increase the capacity of a canal that carries water to San Diego.    As it does with every big contract, Kasler in June told Wall Street that it was low bidder on the canal project, with a $29.9 million bid. Usually, it's assumed by the investment community that the company was awarded the contract, and that's the last that's heard about it.    But yesterday, Kasler said that despite its bid, the company and its joint venture partner &quot;will not be awarded the contract due to the disqualification of a subcontractor.&quot;    It seems the subcontractor, Ball Ball andamp; Brosamer Inc. of Danville, Calif., just couldn't get its math straight.    That's right, math. In the first round of bidding in April, Ball Ball andamp; Brosamer submitted its own bid of $19 million, well below the other bids, which ranged upward of $30 million. The big difference had little to do with Ball Ball andamp; Brosamer's efficiency. Rather, it seems the firm forgot to make a required conversion from tons to cubic yards in calculating costs for the excavation segments of the project, says an attorney for the Metropolitan Water District.    The company realized the error and withdrew its bid, and a second round of bidding began. This time, Kasler and its joint venture partner, Rados Cos.' Steve P. Rados Inc. unit, Santa Ana, won with the $29.9 million bid that included Ball Ball andamp; Brosamer as a subcontractor.    That's when things got nasty. Kiewit Pacific Co. of Santa Fe Springs, which had submitted the second-lowest bid of $30.8 million, filed suit in state court in Los Angeles to disqualify the Kasler-Rados team. California's Public Contract Code states that a bidder who withdraws its bid because it had made certain errors &quot;shall be prohibited from participating in further bidding on the project.&quot; The judge ruled in Kiewit's favor, and Kiewit was awarded the contract. &quot;Kasler andamp; Rados knew what they were doing going into it. They were trying to do an end-run around the statute, said Bernard Kamine, an attorney for Kiewit.    Although Kasler has appealed the ruling to the state Supreme Court, Mr. Ferguson concedes that &quot;realistically, the job won't be awarded to us.&quot; Kasler's portion of the contract would have been about $18 million, but the company said it never added that amount into its backlog, which stood at $188 million on July 31.    &quot;It used to be that if you were the low bidder, and if you added the numbers correctly, you got the job. But that's no longer the case,&quot; laments Mr. Ferguson. </TEXT></DOC>
