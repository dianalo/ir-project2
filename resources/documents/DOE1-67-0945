As part of that technique, the panel included methods for simplifyingthe margins assessment by screening out components and systems usingboth systems and fragilities screening guidelines. At the time of thatreport, the panel was able to develop fragilities screening guidelinesfor all plants, however the systems screening guidelines applied onlyto PWRs (due to a shortage of BWR seismic PRAs upon which to base BWRsystems screening guidelines). This report develops the BWR systems screeningguidelines by utilizing the results of a number of BWR PRAs which havebecome available since the publication of NUREG/CR-4334.</TEXT></DOC>
