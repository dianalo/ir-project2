The crucialpoints to be considered refer to the non-restriction of the existingmobility, in order to be able to conserve energy; the limited possibilitiesof intervening on a security political and road traffic licensing levelin the free choice of traffic; the promotion of non-motorized traffic;shift to public transport with promotion of public transport and shiftto rail transport. Further possibilities of conserving energy are seenin road construction and traffic areas (pedestrian zones, controlledtraffic zones and special public transport lanes) as well as in an improvementof traffic control (traffic-dependent and controlled regulation of trafficlights) and the use of new techniques (guiding and information systems,choice of routes depending on the flow of traffic).
