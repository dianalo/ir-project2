This is one of the first genetically engineered microbialpesticides to be proposed for an EUP under section 5 of the Federal Insecticide,Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. 136(c). This microbial pesticideis unique in that it actually lives within the treated crop plants. TheAgency has determined that this application may be of regional and nationalsignificance. Therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR 172.11(a), the Agencyis soliciting public comments on this application.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE:</T2> Written comments must be received on or before February29, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS:</T2> Comments in triplicate, should bear the docket controlnumber OPP-50675 and be submitted to:<ITAG tagnum="15">Information Services Section, Program Management and Support Division(TS-767C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency,401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">In person bring comments to: Rm. 236, CMandplusmin;2, 1921 JeffersonDavis Highway, Arlington, VA.</ITAG>Information submitted in any comment concerning this notice may be claimedconfidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``ConfidentialBusiness Information'' (CBI).

This application was assigned EPA File Symbol 58788-EUP-R.The proposed experiment involves the endophytic bacterium <T3>Clavibacter xyli</T3> subspecies <T3>cynodontis</T3> that has been genetically engineered to contain a delta-endotoxingene obtained from <T3>Bacillus thuringiensis</T3> subspecies <T3>kurstaki.</T3> After inoculation, the endophytic bacterium grows withinthe corn plants and produces the pesticidal agent which is active againstthe larval stages of the European Corn Borer.The purpose of the EUP is to assess the efficacy of the product in controlof the European Corn Borer on corn plants, study the charateristics ofthe recombinant organism in the environment, and evaluate the effect ofthe organism on crop yield. CGI proposes to initiate the field tests inthe spring of 1988. The proposed field test sites are in Ingleside andBeltsville, Maryland. The sites are each approximately 2 acres in size,isolated and secured. Each site will consist of: (1) A central corn plantpopulation arranged in distinct blocks; (2) a plant-free barren zone surroundingthe test plants; (3) a zone surrounding the barren zone containing plantsto be monitored to detect dissemination of the test agent; (4) a securityfence; and (5) a fallow zone surrounding the security fence.  Studies to be performed at both sites will: (1) Determine <T3>Clavibacter xyli </T3>subsp. <T3>cynodontis/Bacillus Thuringiensis </T3>subsp. <T3>kurstaki </T3>recombinant levels in inoculated plants; (2) monitormechanical and natural spread of the recombinant organism to corn and otherplant species; (3) monitor the recombinant organism in plant residues;(4) monitor the presence of the recombinant organism in runoff water andsoil; and (5) compare yields of colonized and control corn plants. EuropeanCorn Borer control will be studied at the Ingleside site. At Beltsville,ARS-USDA cooperating scientists will examine the effects of recombinantcolonization on: (1) Crop residue decomposition; (2) vesicular-arbuscularmycorrhizae associations; and (3) gram negative phylloplane bacterial populations. According to the applicant, test sites will be monitored until the recombinantorganism can no longer be detected in plant materials or soil. In the eventthat there is movement of the recombinant organism beyond the containedarea, biocides will be employed to the extent necessary for control. Atthe completion of the test, all plant debris will be decontaminated.  The labeling proposed by CGI that would govern the conduct of the experiment,states:  <ITAG tagnum="21">Applicators should wear protective clothing including goggles, dustmask, and gloves. Surfaces of planting equipment should be treated with10% household bleach and wiped with paper towels after use. Dispose ofunused material, paper towels and rinse water by autoclaving or place invessels containing 10% household bleach for disinfection prior to disposal.For use only in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ExperimentalUse Permit.  </ITAG>Following the review of the CGI application and any comments received inresponse to this notice, EPA will decide whether to issue or deny the EUPand, if issued, under what conditions the experiment is to be conducted.Any issuance of an EUP will be announced in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.  <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 25, 1988.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edwin F.
