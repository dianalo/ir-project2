A Centers for Disease Control study said that while otherfactors may influence smoking, education is an increasinglyimportant one.   A 1988 behavioral risk factor survey of 36 states and theDistrict of Columbia found that the less-educated, who also tend tobe of a lower social and economic status, are more likely to besmokers than are others.   ``There has been progress in reducing cigarette smoking,'' saidDr. Luis Escobedo of the Atlanta-based CDC, who analyzed aspects ofthe survey.   ``But the study shows most of the progress is limited to thewell-educated,'' he said.   Escobedo said the National Cancer Institute has a program ininner-city schools working to reduce the odds of children becomingregular smokers, and private institutes and some state healthdepartments do the same.   Results, based on a random telephone survey of 19,822 people 18years of age or older, showed that for people over 35 thelikelihood of being a current smoker increased with each decreasein the level of education.   However, for those age 18 to 34, the chance of being a currentsmoker decreased substantially only for those with more than a highschool education, while smoking rates for high school dropouts andhigh school graduates were more nearly equal.   The study said cultural factors also may affect who smokes. Forexample, Utah, which has a high population of Mormons, whose churchopposes smoking, had the lowest rate of smokers, 18.1 percent, andformer smokers, 9.1 percent.   Kentucky, a tobacco-growing state, had the highest percentage ofcurrent smokers at 37.9 percent. The highest percentage of formersmokers was in Maine, 20.3 percent.   The median figure for current smokers was 26.2 percent, meaningthat half the states were above that figure and half below. Themedian figure for former smokers was 15.1 percent.   The study said other factors affecting who smokes include schoolanti-smoking programs, state cigarette taxes and the intensity ofpromotional events and advertising by the tobacco industry.   The survey was part of a study done annually since 1980 withmore states participating each year, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
