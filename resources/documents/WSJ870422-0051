In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court here, Church andamp; Dwight alleged various violations of trademark law related to Kerr-McGee's Tronacarb product. The suit seeks at least $2 million in damages and $3 million in additional penalties, and an injunction against Kerr-McGee's calling its product sodium bicarbonate.    Church andamp; Dwight, based in Princeton, N.J., claims Tronacarb doesn't meet the minimum industry standards to be called sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda. The suit, which also names Kerr-McGee Chemical Corp., a unit, says Kerr-McGee advertises Tronacarb for various animal-feed and industrial uses. The lawsuit says that recognized industry standards establish at 99% the minimum purity of sodium bicarbonate for use in human food, animal feed and other applications. Church andamp; Dwight claims Tronacarb contains less than 80% sodium bicarbonate.    In Oklahoma City, a Kerr-McGee spokesman said that &quot;We don't feel there is anything to their allegations&quot; and that the company is prepared to respond to the complaint. The spokesman said that Tronacarb contains 88.8% sodium bicarbonate and that Kerr-McGee isn't aware of any standards for minimum purity. </TEXT></DOC>
