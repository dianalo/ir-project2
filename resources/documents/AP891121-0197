Two forest fires sparked by downed power lines burned out ofcontrol in Virginia. The weather was blamed for seven deaths.   A tree toppled by gusting winds struck and killed a principal asshe was getting out of her car Tuesday at her elementary school inMontclair, N.J.   ``She spent a lot of years getting to know these kids and theirfamilies. It's just hard to imagine her not being there,''Superintendent Mary Lee Fitzgerald said in tribute to Agnes Bulmer,60.   A security guard died in Newark, N.J., after a fence blown offby the wind severed his foot.   A Baltimore woman died Monday when a warehouse fell on her home.Slick roads were blamed for four deaths in two separate highwayaccidents in western Pennsylvania. In one, two young men died whentheir pickup slammed into a tractor-trailer and in the other, a9-year-old child and a New York woman were killed when the womanlost control of her car and slammed into a van carrying sixchildren.   The wind and cold were backlashes of an intense storm thatcrossed New York and New England on Monday night and headed intothe Canadian maritime provinces.   The National Weather Service posted blizzard warnings for NewHampshire and most of Maine, where snow accumulations of 15 incheswere expected in some areas.   Bangor International Airport shut down in Maine and Bangorpostal workers suspended deliveries.   The weather service reported gusts of up to 56 mph in Augusta,Maine, and 45 mph in Portsmouth, N.H. Gusts to 47 mph were reportedin Burlington, Vt.   State police in Maine said jackknifed and stalledtractor-trailers were blocking many roads. Three sections ofinterstate were closed temporarily in the Portland and Augustaareas.   As many as 40,000 customers of Maine's largest utility lostelectricity, as did thousands of others in New Hampshire.   Winds up to 86 mph Monday night knocked out power to at least271,500 homes across Pennsylvania, including 97,000 in thePhiladelphia area, utility officials said. Crews were working torestore service to more than 78,420 customers Tuesday afternoon.   In the New York area, gusts knocked out power even as utilitiesdispatched hundreds of workers to fix more than 120,000 outagesfrom a storm Monday night.   That wind storm slung a parked jetliner into a fuel truck atNewark International Airport and badly damaged three jets at JohnF. Kennedy International Airport, authorities said.   Long Island Lighting Co. spokesman Jim Lois said the utilitystill had 28,750 customers without power Tuesday afternoon.   ``Some of the problems are severe _ heavy tree limbs breakingoff, and in some cases whole trees uprooted. We've hadhurricane-force winds for the last 12 to 18 hours,'' said Lois.   Utility workers also were restoring power Tuesday in Ohio,Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., and NorthCarolina.   In Forked River, N.J., 40 mph gusts reversed the flow of waterto the Oyster Creek Nuclear Station on Tuesday.

In New Jersey, high winds damaged 22 homes, a business and 14cars in Seaside Park on the coast and blew two homes off theirfoundations.   Downed power lines sparked more than 50 forest fires Mondaynight in Virginia, two of which remained out of control Tuesday,state and federal officials said.   The largest fire, 250 acres, was in Jefferson National Forest,said Terry Seyden of the U.S. Forest Service. He said he did notexpect containment until the wind abated.
