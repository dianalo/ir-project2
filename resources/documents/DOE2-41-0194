The main objective of thisstudy is to meet some of the goals of the Solar Energy Water DesalinationPlant (SEWDP) plan in the area of economic evaluation. The first partof this project focused on describing the existing trend in the operationand maintenance (Oandamp;M) cost for the SOLERAS Solar Energy Water DesalinationPlant in Yanbu. The second part used the information obtained on existingtrends to find suitable forecasting models. These models, which are foundhere, are sensitive to changes in costs trends. Nevertheless, the studypresented here has established the foundation for (Oandamp;M) costs estimatingin the plant. The methodologies used in this study should continue asmore data on operation and maintenance costs become available, because,in the long run, the trend in costs will help determine where cost effectivenessmight be improved. 7 refs., 24 figs., 15 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
