The ministers of the 13-nation Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries held a flurry of meetings to try to wrap up anagreement.   Venezuelan Oil Minister Celestino Armas, asked if a deal had beenstruck, replid, ``Yes, of course.''   Saudi Arabia's Hisham Nazer said the new production ceiling wouldbe 19.5 million barrels a day. The current cap stands at 18.5million barrels for the first six months of the year.   But the cartel, according to analysts, has been producing abovethat level in recent months.   As a result, analysts say an increase of about a million barrelsin the supply cap should keep crude prices _ and consumers' gasolineprices _ steady.   Further details of the accord were not immediately available.   It was unclear whether the agreement would span six months or befor a shorter period of time.   It also was not immediately known how the ministers had dealtwith Kuwait's demand for a higher production share.   The ministers opened their mid-year conference on Monday, thenbroke up to bargain privately. The talks stalled Tuesday largely dueto Kuwait's demand for a much larger share of any increase in cartelproduction in the last half of the year.   Other members, including influential Saudi Arabia, want theincrease shared proportionately among all the members.   The ministers also appeared to have settled on retaining theirbenchmark price of $18 a barrel. Saudi Arabia had recommendedgetting rid of the target price.   The cartel late last year agreed on its supply ceiling of 18.5million barrels a day for the January-June period, well under outputlevels at that time.   Cutbacks earlier in the year helped drive prices beyond thecartel's $18 benchmark.   Prices have eased a bit recently as OPEC has turned up itsproduction. But the price of a basket of crudes monitored by thecartel was still more than 40 percent above the level of lateNovember.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for Julydelivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, hasbeen trading at more than $20 a 42-gallon barrel.   The International Energy Agency, meanwhile, reported that theOPEC nations lifted their crude production by 500,000 barrels a dayin May to 21 million barrels, the highest so far this year.   The agency's Monthly Oil Market Report predicted demand for thecartel's oil would rise in the second half of the year to about20.85 million barrels a day. The agency previously estimated demandfor the period at 20.4 million barrels a day.</TEXT></DOC>
