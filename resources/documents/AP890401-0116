Speaking before tens of thousands of his supporters in thiscentral port city, Papandreou said he was confident his rulingPanhellenic Socialist Movement would be re-elected to anotherfour-year term in the June 18 elections.   ``The government and I personally set into motion all theprocedures provided by the constitution to clear up the scandal,''Papandreou said.   His socialist government has been accused of involvement in thefinancial scandal surrounding fugitive Greek banker GeorgeKoskotas, jailed in the United States pending an extraditionhearing.   It was Papandreou's first appearance at a mass public rallysince his return from open-heart surgery in London in October.   He was first elected to office in 1981, and again in 1985.   The main conservative opposition New Democracy party said in astatement that Papandreou ``tried with his April Fool's Day speechto present a restored picture'' of himself and his party.   ``Nothing he said deserves special comment,'' the statement said.   The banking scandal and the 70-year-old premier's open affairwith a 34-year-old former airline stewardess have hurt his standingconsiderably among voters, according to recent public opinion polls.   Papandreou has dismissed the scandal as a ``foreign and domesticplot'' to overthrow his government.   Koskotas, former chairman of the Bank of Crete, fled Greece lastNovember after being indicted in a $200 million fraud, forgery andembezzlement scandal. He was arrested in the United States.   In interviews from jail in Salem, Mass., he has claimed thatPapandreou and other senior government officials received millionsof dollars in payoffs and authorized the looting of his bank.</TEXT></DOC>
