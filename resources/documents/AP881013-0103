Choking back tears, Robert G. Brown also told a court that hefeared his family believed that he was the U.S. Marine reportedslain during the ordeal.   ``I was afraid that my wife and children thought I was dead,''said Brown.   Brown testified Wednesday during the trial of Mohammed AliHamadi, who is charged with air piracy and murder in the June 14,1985 hijacking. The Athens-to-Rome flight was diverted to Beirutand 39 Americans were held for 17 days.   U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was shot by the hijackers andtossed out on the runway in Beirut to die. The hijackers hadscreamed ``Marine'' at Stethem while he was beaten and before hewas shot, witnesses have said.   The trial, in a heavily guarded courtroom in a Frankfurt prison,recessed today until Oct. 21.   Brown, 45, described the first minutes after the jetliner wasseized.   ``One man had a pistol in one hand and a grenade in the other,''Brown said referring to Hassan Ezzeddine, Hamadi's allegedaccomplice.   ``The other man (Hamadi) had a hand grenade in has hand. I saw a(grenade) pin on the floor of the plane, which to be honest withyou, frightened the hell out of me.''   He said the hijackers ran through the plane, striking passengers.   ``I was able to see numerous times the brutality that both ofthe hijackers inflicted on the passengers. They were hitting themright and left.''   Brown said that he was later taken off the plane in Beirut andheld by other captors as the hostage ordeal continued. He said hewas first taken to a ``slum house where we were interrogated.   ``We were taken later to an underground prison. For the firstseven days we did not brush our teeth, or wash or change ourclothes. There were no newspapers and no news.''   Brown said the hostages were moved again to a third locationwhere they were allowed to wash and read magazines. The huskyex-Marine said it was then that he believed his family thought he,not Stethem, had been slain.   ``At this time I realized that my wife had been told I waskilled because I had been a Marine and it was published that aMarine had been killed,'' he said.   Hamadi has admitted taking part in the hijacking, but deniesshooting Stethem.   Brown, who said he worked for a medical equipment company, wasnot asked by the court to reveal his residence under courtguidelines for the protection of witnesses.   At the time of the hijacking, Brown listed his residence asStow, Mass.   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in 1987 after customsofficials found explosives in his luggage.</TEXT></DOC>
