Gary Horowitz isn't most people.    Mr. Horowitz, a professor and administrator at Alfred University in Alfred, N.Y., donated $5,000 for renovations at the school last year and got his name on a plaque. It reads &quot;Everyone Has to Be Remembered Somehow!&quot; and is mounted on one of the most scrutinized walls on campus, just across from the toilet in the first floor men's room of Alumni Hall.    &quot;I could have bought a window for $7,500,&quot; he says. &quot;But I wanted to be remembered in a different way.&quot;    Mr. Horowitz's donation has become the butt of bathroom humor at Alfred. But to some, putting plaques in restrooms is no joke. More than ever, many colleges, hospitals, museums and other institutions are naming nearly everything after someone -- for the right price.    To name an endowed chair at Columbia University costs $1.5 million, but naming a plastic chair at the school's football stadium costs just $1,000. Carnegie Hall will name a grand staircase for $500,000 and a loading dock for $250,000; for $75,000, you can have your name on a stagehands' office. Sutter General Hospital in Sacramento, Calif., is putting plaques on a wide range of equipment, from $127,200 ultrasound devices to $1,254 baby scales and $170 tuning-fork kits.    For years, well-heeled philanthropists have donated their spare millions to get their names on entire buildings. But these days, new buildings are so expensive -- or tycoons so cheap -- that few individuals pick up the entire tabs anymore.    So institutions have turned to the masses. Fund-raisers say a main reason for honoring modest donors is an escalation of the alms race among institutions. An ever-growing number of fund drives has increased competition for donations, and people are more willing to give if they get something in return.    &quot;It used to be that people would give money and not care if something was designated or not,&quot; says Robert C. Connor, a Dallas fund-raising consultant. &quot;Nowadays, the reverse is true.&quot; Adds George A. Brakeley III, another fund-raiser: &quot;You're limited only by good taste and imagination. . . . The trouble is, the lower you get, the sillier it gets.&quot;    No one would accuse the Michigan Theater of lacking imagination. In its &quot;Buy a Piece of the Michigan&quot; restoration fund drive last year, the 1,800-seat performing-arts center in Ann Arbor solicited donors for such items as aisle signs ($100 each), light fixtures ($250 apiece), seats ($500 each), stage rigging ($6,000), a boiler ($10,000) and the concession stand ($12,000).    Some items went unsold, but the theater did raise $1.8 million, in part by getting donations for some 800 seats, the mezzanine railing at $12,000 and six toilets and two urinals at $400 a pop. &quot;The plaques went right above the fixtures,&quot; says Sue E. Sasic, the theater's program coordinator.    Hospitals are also proving increasingly adept at the naming game. The Westmoreland Hospital in Greensburg, Pa., will memorialize an elevator lobby or nurses' station for $10,000, a patient room for $5,000 or the ambulance driver's basement office for $3,000. &quot;Who knows what someone may have a liking for?&quot; says Patricia B. Fischl, assistant director of the Westmoreland Hospital Foundation. Besides, elevator lobbies and basement offices are a bargain compared with the hospital's operating suite or radiology department -- both open for naming at $100,000 each.    And then there are more esoteric items. Richard J. Bertero, a trustee of the California Academy of Sciences, recently gave $25,000 to the academy to fund restoration of the stuffed grizzly bear that in 1952 served as a model for California's current state flag. Next year, the bear will go on display at the academy, bearing a plaque with the Bertero family name. &quot;My great-grandfather came over from Italy and hit it big in the gold fields here,&quot; says Mr. Bertero. &quot;That bear is a symbol of California, and the West, and the outdoors.&quot;    Sentimental thoughts also played a role in Laurence F. Doering's recent gift of about $30,000 to his alma mater, Colgate University. He passed up locker rooms and the pole-vault area, among others, to fund the first-aid room in the school's new field house. &quot;I served in the medical corps during World War II,&quot; explains the retired investment adviser.    To solicit donors, many institutions put out glossy catalogs. The most elaborate come complete with floor plans, color-coded diagrams, price lists and payment schedules. All include a reminder that donations are tax-deductible.    The catalogs also offer a lesson: When it comes to named gifts, it pays to do some comparison shopping. A new chapel at Massachusetts General Hospital, for example, costs $2 million; at the Westmoreland Hospital, the chapel went for $20,000. The gift shop at the Seattle Art Museum can be yours for $500,000; the new Judaica shop at Temple of Israel in Greenville, S.C., will be named for a donor who recently gave $10,000.    Whatever the price, the demand for an item is often related to where it is. Because lots of people pass through them, lobbies, waiting rooms and reception areas are among the first things that attract donors in a new building, fund-raisers say.    Elevators are popular, too. &quot;Some people laugh about it,&quot; says Dell N. Thompson, vice president for development at the Albany (N.Y.) Medical Center, which is offering elevators for $150,000 each. &quot;But when you bring to their attention the high kind of visibility that an elevator receives, it really turns people's thinking around.&quot;    Not surprisingly, some things just won't sell no matter what the price. &quot;Who the hell wants to put his name on a boiler?&quot; asks Mr. Brakeley, the fund-raising consultant. &quot;It has no sex appeal.&quot;    Neither, it turns out, did the stage door at the Wortham Theater Center in Houston, which opened in May after a $70 million campaign. Priced at $500,000, the door had no takers. &quot;We were very surprised,&quot; says Marcia James, who helped direct the theater drive. &quot;After all, stage doors have such mystique attached to them.&quot;    Finding donors for some gifts can be tough, but it's not the only problem institutions face when it comes to named gifts. When the University of Pennsylvania received a $4 million gift in 1982 toward renovation of the Wharton School's main building, it wanted to honor the donor, Reliance Group Holdings Inc. chairman and 1959 Wharton alumnus Saul P. Steinberg, by naming the building for him. But it already was named Dietrich Hall after the original donors.    After negotiations, the Dietrich family agreed to a new name: &quot;Steinberg Hall-Dietrich Hall.&quot; But someone forgot to tell the stonecutters. Just weeks before the dedication, they delivered a large new entranceway plaque reading &quot;Dietrich Hall-Steinberg Hall.&quot; Aghast, Wharton sent it back to switch the names.    And what if the name that gave the radiation machine or the reading room becomes sullied? The Jewish Theological Seminary in New York faced that situation last year when one of its benefactors, Ivan F. Boesky, was revealed to have been involved in Wall Street's insider-trading scandal. After the scandal broke, the seminary removed the names of Mr. Boesky and his wife, Seema, from its library. A seminary official hastens to explain the action: &quot;He wanted his name removed from the library, and we complied with his request.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
