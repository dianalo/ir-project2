The EEC, which charges that Washington's measures violateinternational trade rules, made its bid at a regular two-day councilmeeting of the 96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.   GATT sets global trade rules and is a forum for resolving tradedisputes. It traditionally operates by consensus.   EEC delegate Tran Van-Thinh urged a quick probe and warned of afurther deterioration in the latest transatlantic trade dispute, ameeting source reported on condition of anonymity.   Many delegations backed the EEC's criticism of the U.S. measuresin a council debate Wednesday.   But at Thursday's session, U.S. envoy Michael Samuels rejectedthe EEC request for an investigation by a panel of neutral GATTexperts, saying it was premature.   Senior U.S. and EEC trade officials are scheduled to hold talkson the issue in Washington next week. The discussions could becomemore complicated if GATT were to begin an investiation, he said.   Canada, Chile, Brazil and Nicaragua also supported the EEC callfor a panel.   The EEC's import ban on hormone-treated meat went into effectlast Jan. 1, affecting U.S. sales of beef and veal valued at morethan $100 million. The EEC said meat treated with hormones couldpose a health risk, which Washington disputes.   In response, Washington immediately slapped high duties onimports of European food products including boneless beef, ham andpork shoulders.   EEC foreign ministers approved a plan Jan. 23 to impose100-percent duties on imports of U.S. walnuts and dried fruit. Butthe ministers delayed implementation to give more time fornegotiations and said they would review the situation Feb. 20 beforemaking a final decision on retaliation.   Barring a quick settlement, the U.S.-EEC row is likely toresurface at an emergency GATT Council meeting Feb. 21.   GATT officials scheduled the session at the request of Brazil,which wants to renew pressure for a ruling on whether 100-percentU.S. tariffs on Brazilian drugs, paper products and consumerelectronics violate trade rules.   Washington imposed the sanctions last year because it saidBrazilian laws insufficiently protect foreign pharmaceutical patents.   On Wednesday, some 50 countries backed Brazil, leaving the UnitedStates isolated.   But Samuels vetoed the Brazilians' second request for aninvestigation, noting that the new U.S. administration is stillformulating its position on the case.</TEXT></DOC>
