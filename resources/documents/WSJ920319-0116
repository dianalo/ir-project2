Gasoline led the way down in U.S. futures trading,although heating oil also was weak.</LP><TEXT>   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, unleaded gasoline forApril delivery declined 1.33 cents a gallon to settle at58.83 cents. May gasoline dropped 1.10 cents a gallon to60.03 cents.   Oil analysts blamed the price drops on the industry'slatest weekly count of U.S. inventories of gasoline andheating oil. Big multimillion-barrel decreases had beenexpected for the fuels because of recent indications of firmdemand and the cold weather in the northern U.S. But theAmerican Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday thatstocks of gasoline and heating oil declined last week by onlya modest 113,000 barrels and 228,000 barrels, respectively.   &quot;That caught everybody off guard,&quot; said Peter Beutel,director of the energy group at Pegasus Econometric. &quot;Therewasn't an analyst on the street predicting drawdowns thatlow.&quot;   The weakness in fuels helped pull down crude prices asmuch as 17 cents a barrel in both U.S. and London futurestrading. Still, traders noted that U.S. crude for Aprildelivery settled at $19.07 a barrel, above the psychologicalsupport level of $19.   Helping to prevent a steeper fall in crude prices, someanalysts suggested, was the large drawdown -- 4.8 millionbarrels -- that did take place in U.S. crude-oil inventorieslast week. Also, they cited an upturn in U.S. refiningoperations, which had reached the lowest level in five yearslast month. According to the API, U.S. refineries operated at81% of capacity last week, up two percentage points, or447,000 barrels a day, from the week-earlier level.   &quot;We have seen the bottom of refinery utilization for thisseasonal cycle,&quot; said Robert Boslego, a Winchester, Mass.,consultant who analyzes oil industry statistics. While a risein plant operations may be &quot;negative&quot; for petroleum productsbecause more will be produced, it can be &quot;positive&quot; forcrudes because of the higher demand for oil by the refiners,he said.   Firming crude prices also are foreseen by Purvin andamp; GertzInc. The refining consultants, in their latest monthlypetroleum market analysis, estimated that West TexasIntermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, will be back in the$20 range by early in the second quarter.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Prices continued to display weakness butdid not sink as much yesterday as they did on Tuesday.Platinum for April delivery was the weakest, falling $5.70 anounce to $346.90. April gold closed at $338.80, off $1.80 anounce. May silver fell 1.8 cents an ounce to $4.052. TomGriffo, metals analyst for Cargill Investors Services in NewYork, said, &quot;I think more people bought platinum ahead of thereferendum in South Africa than we anticipated.&quot; He notedthat platinum selling first became obvious early Tuesday whenreturns showed the referendum proposed by President de Klerkwas winning. Traders concluded that supplies of gold andsilver were less likely to be interrupted by unrest in SouthAfrica. Mr. Griffo noted that additional pressure was appliedto platinum when a substantial number of traders appeared toabandon &quot;spread&quot; positions consisting of being long platinumand short gold. &quot;Because the platinum market is so muchthinner than the gold market when traders put on or close outthese spreads, it always affects platinum more than gold,&quot;Mr. Griffo said. He pointed out that many traders hadinitiated this spread trade in late February when platinumwas an abnormally narrow $2 away from gold's price. Evenafter platinum's price collapsed yesterday, the spread stillfavored platinum by more than $8. Mr. Griffo said bothmarkets are very close to being oversold. &quot;But I believe thatthe $336 area in gold will have to be retested successfullybefore many traders will want to make a commitment to themetal again,&quot; he said.                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices of wheat futures contracts areexpected to rise today in the wake of the White House'sdecision to immediately give the Commonwealth of IndependentStates the $250 million allocation of food-buying creditguarantees that was originally slated to become available inApril. Grain traders said that the commonwealth plans to use$90 million of the allocation to purchase roughly 700,000metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat. The commonwealth isexpected to use about $52 million of the guarantees toarrange loans to buy 450,000 metric tons of U.S. feed grains.The rest of the allocation will be used to buy soybeans,soybean meal, vegetable oil, and to pay for transportation,among other things. The announcement was unusual because theBush administration said that Ukraine won't have access tothis latest allocation. Some traders interpreted the move asa sign that the White House is beginning to tailor food aidto specific republics. Ukraine has already asked the U.S. foran independent allocation of $300 million in food-buyingcredit guarantees, but it isn't clear how soon theadministration might respond to the request.                                                                                                          LUMBER: May futures fell $3.30 to $253.10 for each 1,000board feet. Bud Merrill, forest products analyst at ShearsonLehman Brothers in Eugene, Ore., said the drop was due to acombination of profittaking and buyers who lack strongbullish convictions being scared out of the market. Lumberprices have been moving up sharply since Thursday. They rosetheir maximum daily permissible limit of $5 for each 1,000board feet on both Friday and Monday and an additional $2.30on Tuesday. Last week the U.S. government announced acountervailing duty on lumber imported from Canada, causingshort sellers, who had sold contracts in expectation of aprice decline, to rush to buy offsetting contracts, which inturn drove prices higher. The shorts began buying when theylearned that the lumber futures contract calls for holders ofshort positions to pay all import duties. Mr. Merrill pointedout that even after prices had run up for three days, thefutures contract still was the cheapest source of sprucelumber. He said he remains a bull on lumber and doesn'texpect this sell-off to send prices below $247. Mr. Merrillalso noted that he expects lumber prices to reach the $265 to$275 range before the May contract expires.</TEXT></DOC>
