If the information about the component limits therange of possible values for the reliability, the required sample sizemay be reduced while acceptable assessments of reliability are maintained.It is shown that for the usual range of interest, the allowed fractionreduction, f, in the sample size is a function of only the ratio of theallocation requirement and the limit on the possible reliability values.A table illustrating the sample size reduction is presented. 3 refs.,1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
