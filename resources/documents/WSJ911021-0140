The files can reveal the immense dimensions of thecrime that was perpetrated against humanity in general andalso against particular nations. Your Sept. 11 page-onearticle, &quot;KGB Files May Fill Holes in History, But WithWhat?&quot; wrongly places emphasis only on the more publicizedKGB-connected assassinations and attempts. It almost fails tomention the central work of the KGB over the 72 years whensome 60 million people were murdered. A score of nationscomprising some 300 million people were kept in constantterror. Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia lost a third of theirpeople.   Due to the existence of these files, we at last have achance to learn how many were killed and also where and underwhat circumstances. We must search out the full details sothat we can prevent it from ever happening again.</LP><TEXT>   Al Kazlauksas   President   Lithuanian Roman Catholic Federation   Chicago District   Chicago</TEXT></DOC>
