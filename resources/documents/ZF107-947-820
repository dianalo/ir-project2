 Suppose it corrected your spelling as it went.andP;  You'd jumpat it, right?andP;  Wrong.andP;  Several such programs exist, but they're languishing.andO;It's not that they're new or secret.andP;  You could find them if you were lookingfor them.andP;  The question is why you aren't looking.andM;The first program I saw was MindReader.andP;  It was written by Kalman Toth, whohad the entrepreneurial zeal necessary to champion a bold new idea.andM;MindReader is a word processor that watches your keystrokes and tries tofigure out what word you're trying to type.andP;  It refines its choices as youget farther into the word, and it keeps track of the frequency with which youuse certain words.andP;  It puts a window onto the screen with what it considersthe likeliest choices.andP;  You press the number of the desired word and it getsinserted into your text.andM;MindReader offers the word you're looking for surprisingly often.andP;  If it'snot the first choice, it's usually one of the others in the box.andP;  Rarely isthe program stumped, and even then, it can learn new words from you and offerthem back with consideration given to the frequency with which you use them.andM;Using MindReader results in effective typing speeds in thehundreds-of-words-per-minute range.andP;  And, of course, every word it completesis spelled correctly.andP;  Sounds like heaven, doesn't it?andP;  But MindReader soldpoorly.andP;  It was marred by sound effects and screen displays that lent a videogame--like atmosphere to the otherwise mundane job of word processing.andO;(Later versions let you disable the sound.)andP;  Such tricks sent the wrongmessage in a market that was trying to convince management that PCs wereserious business machines.andP;  Toth finally gave up on the product and remandedit to Brown Bag Software, which sells it as shareware.andM;The next big effort to crack the typing speed barrier was PRD+, offered byProductivity Software International, the same group that has dominion overStenoscript.andP;  You remember Stenoscript--those matchbooks that said, &quot;IF U CNRD THS U CN GT A GD JB.&quot;andP;  Stenoscript is still taught in secretarial schools,and it really works.andP;  Central to its effectiveness is a standard way ofabbreviating prefixes and suffixes on root words or abbreviations thatsuggest root words.andP;  After learning the method, any Stenoscript-trainedperson can read or transcribe another's notes.andM;OVERCOMING OBSTACLESandM;PRD+ lets your computer comprehend Stenoscript.andP;  It's a memory-residentprogram, so it works with most popular software.andP;  You can even use it at theDOS prompt to abbreviate lengthy DOS commands.andP;  Like MindReader, PRD+ booststyping speeds to hundreds of words per minute.andP;  But like MindReader, it isn'tdoing as well as you might expect.andM;Some of the impediments to the success of these keying accelerators areobvious.andP;  Both products require that proficient typists relearn or modifytheir skills.andP;  The hunt-and-peck typist may be thankful for the assistance;everybody else just gets annoyed.andM;But people can, in fact, retrain themselves, just as they can find andoperate the different light switches and door handles in Ford and GM cars.andO;So that alone wouldn't be enough to explain the relative lack of acceptanceof such productivity-enhancing software.andM;The real obstacle goes deeper, and it involves the way people learn andthink.andP;  There's no doubt that shorthand is more efficient than longhand.andP;  Yetwe don't learn it in school.andP;  It's the province of secretaries trained totake dictation, and even there it's a disappearing skill as more executiveslearn to type.andM;Managers and professionals don't use shorthand because it interferes with thethinking process.andP;  When you're writing, you're really not thinking about thespelling.andP;  The words just flow out of your fingers in response to the imagesforming in your mind.andP;  In a multilevel process, you superimpose a sentencestructure on the images, and rough outlines of the sentences to follow formin your mind.andP;  The slowest aspect of the process is the time that it takes toget the words out.andP;  The process is interactive.andP;  The words we choose to bestrepresent the images in our minds cannot help but modify the images.andM;NOT WITHOUT REASONandM;E.andP;  D. Hirsch, Jr., has written a wonderful treatise on the broader aspectsof the process in his book Cultural Literacy.andP;  Language, he notes, ispowerfully evocative.andP;  We're continually thinking in terms of the images andassociations that the words we use invoke.andP;  In fact, comprehension oflanguage is utterly dependent on context.andM;This may seem blindingly obvious, but the breakthrough is that Hirsch and themany researchers he draws upon have found ways to prove the assumptions andmeasure the effects of style and context on comprehension.andP;  Hirsch points outthat recognizing uncommon words requires a significant expenditure of mentalenergy.andP;  For example, it takes much longer for people to agree that &quot;achicken is a bird&quot; than it does for them to agree that &quot;a robin is a bird.&quot;andO;Small wonder, then, that a program that requires you to substitute anabbreviation for a word or to choose from a list of completed words willinterfere with creative flow.andM;PRD+ and MindReader tend to distance us from the context of the language byforcing us to think about abbreviations or by interrupting us.andP;  Does thatrender products of their ilk valueless?andP;  Hardly.andP;  While I think they'reunsuitable for the creative process, in which style and flow are critical,they're invaluable for high-volume typing.andP;  We all contend with boilerplatewriting in our work.andP;  Products such as MindReader and PRD+ get those wordsonto paper faster and more easily.andP;  Give them a try--but only in context.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
