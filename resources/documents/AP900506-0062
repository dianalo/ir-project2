But Breslin's apology, sent to Newsday staffers on Friday as aninternal computer message, failed to quell the brouhaha over hisremarks.   On Sunday, Asian-American groups called for his resignation forthe outburst against staff reporter Ji-Yeon Mary Yuh, 25, who hadsent him an internal computer message calling his May 3 columnsexist.   In an obscenity-laced newsroom tirade, Breslin called Yuh``slant-eyed.''   ``She's a yellow cur. Let's make it racial,'' Breslin said.   His remarks, made outside the presence of Yuh, were reported bythe Daily News and in a letter of complaint to Newsday managersfrom members of the paper's staff.   The 61-year-old Pulitzer prize winner's apology said in part:   ``To the people I work with. I am no good and once again I canprove it. ... I am sorry. I said things I shouldn't have said. Theracial and sexual insults I spewed are never appropriate.''   But Helen Zia, president of the New York chapter of theAsian-American Journalists Association, said the apology was ``veryflip.''   Zia's group joined the Coalition Against Anti-Asian Violence andthe Organization of Asian Women in demanding that Breslin resign orbe fired, and that he make a formal public apology to Yuh.   The columnist's apology to the staff came after an internalsystem-wide computer reprimand from editor Don Forst _ who calledBreslin's racist and sexist comments ``offensive and inexcusable''_ and protests by the paper's staff, some of whom heard hisoutburst.   ``This is the worst case of racism I have encountered,'' Yuh, anative of Chicago who lives in Jersey City, N.J., said Sunday.   Yuh, who reports for Newsday from Queens, says she has never metBreslin and has never communicated with him before her messageThursday _ also sent to Forst and another editor _ which criticizedBreslin's portrayal of the role of women in Thursday's column.   Breslin said he hated what he called ``official women,''including his wife, City Councilwoman Ronnie Eldrdige, who he saiddevoted too much of her time to official duties and not enough tothe home.   Yuh messaged Breslin that his column was ``spewing sexism.''   According to a letter to Newsday editor Anthony Marro, writtenby reporter Jessie Mangaliman and signed by 46 staff members,Breslin stormed into the newsroom Friday after reading Yuh'smessage. In addition to the racial epithets, Breslin used coarsesexual terms to describe Yuh, according to the letter, whichdenounced Breslin's ``racist vituperation,'' and called hisbehavior ``unprofessional.''   ``There's a part of me that says, `Let him be suspended,' butthere's another part of me that says, `Let him be fired,''' saidYuh.   ``It proves that racism comes in all kinds of packaging, you canencounter it anywhere, from your colleagues, in the boardroom, fromyour neighbors _ not necessarily people in a white sheet,'' shesaid, referring to the Ku Klux Klan.   In a comment about her husband quoted by the Daily News onSunday, Eldridge said Breslin ``doesn't believe what he wrote inhis heart, but the way he is, when he knows he's wrong, he lashesout. He just acts that way.''   Newsday spokeswoman Chiara Coletti said Sunday the paper plansno further action against Breslin.</TEXT></DOC>
