In Milan, share prices fell across the board and theGeneral MIB index tumbled 1.17%, as investors liquidated somepositions ahead of a strike by floor traders that isscheduled to start today for an indefinite period. The Milanbourse will probably be shut down, because the floor tradersexecute transactions for stockbrokers. The planned walkout isto protest expected layoffs of more than 300 floor traders,under a stock-market reform measure to form new Italiansecurities trading houses, called Societa di IntermediazioneMobiliare.

In Stockholm, where stocks fell on negative domesticindicators and worries about the economic outlook, Sweden'snew nonsocialist government, as expected, decided to abolishthe so-called turnover tax on stock transactions as of Dec. 1and will present the proposal to the Riksdag, or parliament,next week. The turnover tax -- it was introduced in 1984 at1% of a transaction's value and increased in 1986 to 2%, thenreduced to 1% this year -- had been sharply criticized bystock market participants, who asserted it contributed toreduced volume in Stockholm and pushed trading activity toother exchanges, especially London, that don't have such atax. Last year, about 45% of all trading in Swedish sharesstemmed from transactions done at exchanges other thanStockholm. Since the tax was cut on Jan. 1, Stockholm tradingvolume has improved about 25%.   Stocks fell throughout Asian and Pacific exchanges.
