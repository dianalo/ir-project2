Anderson, a former Treasury secretary under President Eisenhower, pleaded guilty in federal court to a variety of tax-evasion schemes and the illegal operation of an offshore bank.    Among other things, the 76-year-old lawyer and business consultant admitted that he recruited depositors for Commercial Exchange Bank andamp; Trust Ltd., in the British West Indies, an unregistered bank that lost $4 million of depositors' money from 1983 to 1985 in an energy-project swindle.    Much of the Commercial Exchange money was lost by &quot;innocent&quot; depositors who had relied on Mr. Anderson's reputation as a former cabinet official, said Paul E. Summit, the assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the case. Depositors in many offshore-bank schemes seek to have their money laundered to conceal its origin.    Mr. Anderson, in an appearance at federal court in Manhattan yesterday, also pleaded guilty to failing to file his 1983 and 1984 tax returns and to tax evasion. He admitted, for example, that he concealed $159,000 he received to lobby in Washington and elsewhere for the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church in 1983 and 1984. There is &quot;no indication the Unification Church committed any crimes,&quot; U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said.    &quot;I deeply regret the mistakes I have made,&quot; Mr. Anderson, reading a prepared statement, told U.S. District Judge Edmund L. Palmieri. Mr. Anderson faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and $500,000 in fines at his sentencing, set for May 7.    Before he was Treasury secretary, Mr. Anderson was deputy defense secretary from 1954 to 1955 and secretary of the Navy from 1953 to 1954.    Mr. Anderson also admitted to encouraging a friend, who wasn't charged, to lie to a grand jury hearing testimony in the case earlier this year.    Judge Palmieri released Mr. Anderson on his own recognizance pending sentencing.    Court papers filed by the government indicate Mr. Anderson has known about the investigation since March 1985, when a man described as his partner in the offshore bank, David Gould, was arrested on charges of currency-transaction violations. Mr. Gould later pleaded guilty to the charges.    A second man, Houston businessman Newton Steele, last year pleaded guilty to stealing $4 million from the bank by investing depositors' money in fraudulent oil and gas projects. The government said Mr. Steele was able to steal the money because the bank, being unregistered, wasn't properly monitored by regulators. Both men are awaiting sentencing.    Mr. Summit said the investigation into the bank is continuing.    Prosecutors said that despite his age, they will urge a prison term for the former Treasury secretary, whom Mr. Eisenhower once considered to succeed him as president. In particular, &quot;we were shocked that a former secretary of the Treasury of such high standing had failed to file his tax returns,&quot; Mr. Giuliani said.    Mr. Anderson had been the chief foe of tax reduction in the Eisenhower administration, saying in a 1958 speech that having people pay less taxes to boost the economy is a &quot;form of monetary magic.&quot;    But Mr. Anderson's views on paying taxes apparently changed. In a March 1985 discussion with a Texas businessman that was secretly recorded during the government's investigation, Mr. Anderson compared the tax advantages of his offshore bank with those of domestic banks that can't hide money as well.    &quot;You can go to Chemical Bank and say, 'I want to move my money abroad,' . . . and they'll say 'Fine, we've got an overseas division in England,' (but) the Treasury has got as much control over that money as if (it) were up here on Fifth Avenue in New York,&quot; he said. &quot;You just can't hide it as long as you're in one of these American banks.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
