(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Illinois is taking its juiced-uptourism campaign overseas to dispel a gangster-ridden image andlure foreign visitors.   ``International people still think of us as `Al Capone livesnext door,' and this is one of the things we have to dispel intheir minds,'' said Mary Burns, international marketing specialistfor the Illinois Office of Tourism.   To do that, the state and Trans World Airlines have produced anupbeat commercial for British television that describes Chicago asa world-class city with a rich culture and nightlife.   Tour brochures circulated by British Airways in West Germanydescribe Chicago as ``the heart and soul of the Americas.'' Theyfeature inviting views of the city's lakefront and historic sitesin other parts of Illinois.   ``Chicago and Illinois are described in detail to get rid ofthis Al Capone image that still prevails,'' said Lothar Kegelmann,market development manager in West Germany for British Airways.   The international effort is the latest twist in a four-yearcampaign that officials credit for significant growth in thestate's tourist industry.   Since 1984, the state Office of Tourism has spent $10 million ayear on ads promoting tourism, up from about $800,000 in earlieryears.   From 1984 to 1986, the number of employees in the state'stourism industry increased 14 percent compared with a rise of 9percent in the nation overall. Tourist spending in Illinois in thefiscal year ending June 30 is expected to reach $10.8 billion, up30 percent from $8.3 billion three years ago, state officials say.   Officials hope to boost those figures further and say foreigntourists are a rich, untapped market, especially in light of thedollar's low value compared with many foreign currencies. They havepursued a variety of strategies to lure foreigners, some costly andsome virtually free.   To pay for the British commercials, Illinois and TWA eachcontributed $200,000 and the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administrationkicked in $40,000.   Those commercials attracted the interest of British televisionexecutives, who plan to produce a documentary on Chicago comparingthe Windy City to Paris and Rio de Janeiro.   In the past year, state tourism officials also have helpedorganize visits by 18 groups of foreign travel agents and touroperators, and six groups of travel journalists. Ms. Burns said thetrips were paid for by airline companies, hotels and others in theindustry.   State officials don't expect immediate dividends from theoverseas campaign. Their advisers say it typically takes five yearsto produce a significant response.   ``Don't expect miracles and don't ask for passenger numberswithin the next couple months,'' Kegelmann said. ``It takes timeand a little bit of patience, but we are confident we are going tomake it.''   One expert believes Illinois might get a little help from theCapone legacy.   ``I can understand why (Illinoisans) are sensitive about AlCapone and the so-called violent image of Chicago but I think ithas changed over the years to become a colorful image,'' said JohnCooper, director of marketing for TWA's international division.</TEXT></DOC>
