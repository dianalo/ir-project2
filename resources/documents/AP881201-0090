RJR Nabisco Inc. directors approved the $109-a-share offer byKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. Inc. late Wednesday, capping a day offrantic, confusing maneuvering in the auction of thecigarette-and-food giant.   A member of the competing investment group led by RJR chiefexecutive officer F. Ross Johnson said their last-minute offer _$25.42 billion or $112 per share _ had been higher, but suggestedthe group had been cheated by an unfair bidding process.   The value of Kohlberg's offer for America's 19th largestindustrial company was nearly double the old takeover record, $13.4billion for Gulf Corp. in 1984.   Although the Johnson group's offer appeared to be higher, RJRsaid its board of directors concluded Kohlberg's offer wassubstantially equal. Kohlberg's offer per share broke down to $81 incash, $18 in stock and additional securities worth $10, RJR said.   ``The Board of Directors of RJR Nabisco, by unanimous vote of alldirectors present, adopted the KKR offer as being in the bestinterest of the company and its shareholders,'' the company said.RJR did not say exactly why Kohlberg's offer prevailed.   The breakdown of the Johnson group's bid was not disclosed, butShearson Lehman Hutton, the Wall Street firm that was one of its keyfinancial partners, said, ``From what we know, our bid was thebest.''   ``We are mystified about the process and the standards that theboard used to reach its decision,'' it said in a statement. ``We aregoing to continue to keep our options open. We believe the RJRshareholders will have a lot of questions as well.''   Kohlberg, the undisputed leader in buying companies with borrowedmoney in deals known as leveraged buyouts, said it was happy withthe outcome.   ``We are also pleased that this process has come to an end sothat the employees of RJR, its consumers and suppliers and thecommunities it serves, can be assured that business will now returnto normal and stability will be restored,'' Kohlberg's twoprincipals, Henry R. Kravis and George Roberts, said in a statement.   However, the deal raised the prospect that some businesses in oneof America's biggest consumer product companies might be sold tohelp Kohlberg pay for its prize.   Kohlberg gave no indication which of RJR's worldwide operationsmight be discarded. There was speculation that candidates couldinclude some or all of RJR's food businesses. RJR's tobacco businessroots still account for about 40 percent of its sales.   Atlanta-based RJR is one of the largest consumer productscompanies, with more than 120,000 employees worldwide. Its brandsinclude such well-known products as Camel cigarettes, Shredded Wheatand Life Savers.   The deal's size and complexity have raised major questions aboutwhether the frenzied level of leveraged buyouts and debt-financedrestructurings has gone too far in transforming much of corporateAmerica.   The deal also signaled a spectacular defeat for Johnson, whosegroup began the struggle to take the company private with a$75-a-share offer on Oct. 20 that was raised five times.   ``I am proud that we put the best bid on the table the first timeand this time,'' Johnson said in a statement following Kohlberg'svictory.   It was not clear whether the scrappy, daring executive would tryto reopen the war. His tenure as head of RJR was even less certain.   The Atlanta Constitution reported today that Kohlberg wouldinstall RJR's former chairman and chief executive officer, J. PaulSticht, in the top post for a few months to smooth the transition.The newspaper said Kohlberg would move the company's corporateheadquarters back to Winston-Salem, N.C.   Earlier Wednesday, Johnson's group tried to raise its bid after acompany-decreed deadline for all offers expired. The movetemporarily upended a $106-a-share, $23.8 billion Kohlberg Kravisoffer the RJR board was about to approve.   In heavy New York Stock Exchange trading Wednesday, RJR stockshot up $2.25 to $93 a share on the possibility the auction would beprolonged. In early trading today, RJR was off 75 cents to $92.25 ashare.   Sources familiar with the bidding who spoke on condition ofanonymity said the offer of a third contender, First Boston Corp.was rejected as too tentative, although the bidder valued it as highas $115 a share or $25.87 billion.   When the battle began in October, RJR stock was trading at lessthan $56 a share. For RJR shareholders who held on for the last fivewild weeks, their pretax gain totals nearly 95 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
