The coastal area includesan array of ground motion monitors that recorded the main shock of September19 and the aftershock of September 21. Reliable estimates of the groundmotion experienced at the power plant sites and in the industrial aretherefore available. Damage to structures and equipment installationsat the two hydroelectric power plants was minimal. In the industrialarea near the Port of Lazero Cardenas, a moderate amount of damage wasexperienced. Ground motion records indicate significant differences inthe amplitude and frequency content of the ground motion between therock sites of the power plants, and the soil sites of the industrialfacilities. The difference in levels of damage is primarily attributedto this difference in site conditions. Both the power plants and theindustrial facilities are modern and generally appear well designed andconstructed. The earthquake performance of their structures and equipmentinstallations therefore provides useful information on the expected performanceof modern power facilities, in particular nuclear plants, under similarearthquake conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
