(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Periodic droughts in the western UnitedStates may be linked to changes in the positions of the sun andmoon, researchers say.   Charles W. Stockton of the University of Arizona says there's no``physical proof that these changes actually would influencedrought,'' but since 1600 recurring drought coincided with solarand lunar cycles.   By studying and extrapolating astronomical data, Stockton said,it may be possible to forecast droughts. Based on the research, hesaid, the West's next drought, which will be severe but notwidespread, will be in the late 1990s.   Stockton, David Meko of Arizona's tree-ring laboratory, and J.Murray Mitchell Jr., a retired climatologist with the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, found clues in tree rings,which vary based on rainfall.   Severe but localized droughts, similar to last year's in theMidwest, occur during the solar minimum, the period in the sun's22-year cycle when sunspots diminish to their lowest number,Stockton said. The same thing occurs during the lunar cycle whenthe moon lines up with the sun, every 18.6 years.   When those two phenomena occur in roughly the same year, aboutevery two centuries, a devastating drought should sear most of theWest, Stockton said, adding that the last such occurrence was inthe Dust Bowl days of the 1930s.   No one knows how the cycles may alter Earth's climate, but``there is some evidence now that the luminosity of the sun changeswith sunspot numbers,'' he said. That is, the fewer the sunspots,the hotter the sun's surface.   Whether it would be hot enough to trigger drought is anunanswered question, Stockton said, adding that the sunspots couldcause a slight rise in temperature, evaporating water from theEarth's surface, killing many plants.   The lunar link is more elusive, he said.</TEXT><HEAD>Panther Reintroduction Program Halted After Texas Cougar Deaths</HEAD><DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Researchers hoping to help endangeredFlorida panthers expand and move outside the Everglades have cutshort part of a test after four of seven cougars being used assurrogates died or were killed.   The last two alive were captured last week near Osceola NationalForest, said Tom Logan of the Florida Game and Fresh Water FishCommission. ``The two animals would not have given us any newinformation. We don't feel it's prudent or productive to leave theanimals out in the field.''   Of the seven Texas cougars released in North Florida to see howpanthers might adapt outside South Florida's Everglades, one diedof unknown causes, two were shot by poachers and one was injuredwhile being captured by wildlife officers and had to be killed. Afifth was captured about two weeks ago.   Of the two captured last week, one was found napping in a treein a residential Jacksonville neighborhood and the other had beenhunting exotic deer at a private hunting preserve north of LakeCity.   The Florida panther once roamed North Florida, but is nowconfined to the Everglades where officials estimate no more than 50survive. The last confirmed North Florida sighting of one of thebig cats was in the early 1960s.   Wildlife officials had planned to end the program in June, ayear after the release of the first five cougars; two more werereleased in March.   ``When we had the original group, they behaved as they should.When the numbers were reduced, things started happening,'' Logansaid. ``We need to evaluate the number of animals out there and howit affects them.''   Until information from the experiment is evaluated, Logan saidhe could not recommend whether Florida panthers should be releasedin North Florida.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for April 27</NOTE></DOC>
