The measures are part of a last-ditch effort by Gov. PeteWilson's administration to avert a ballot initiative nextyear that could slap much more restrictive limitations onlogging in California, the third largest timber-producingstate. Gov. Wilson made such an initiative more likely lastweek when he vetoed compromise timber-reform legislationsupported by some of the state's influential environmentalgroups and much of the timber industry.</LP><TEXT>   The measures adopted by the forestry board are temporaryand are likely to be challenged in court by some loggingcompanies. Moreover, they were attacked by manyenvironmentalists as inadequate. If they hold up, they wouldlimit at least some of the practices most criticized by treedefenders everywhere. For example, clear-cutting would bebanned in ancient forests and limited to 20 acres under mostcircumstances on other timberland; buffer zones betweenclear-cuts would be increased and protections for wildlife,and watersheds would be strengthened.   The board's new steps are almost identical to provisionsin the bill Gov. Wilson vetoed last week, under pressure fromthree big timber companies, Louisiana-Pacific Corp., PacificLumber Co. and Simpson Timber Co. The emergency measuresexpire in four months. The governor has said he'll introducenew timber reform legislation when the next session begins inJanuary.</TEXT></DOC>
