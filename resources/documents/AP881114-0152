Says Rights Violations Increase In El Salvador</HEAD><BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Human rights violations have risen sharplythis year in El Salvador, where both the government and guerrillasare to blame for an increase in bloodshed, a U.N. report said Monday.   The report, which echoes a similar accusations made by AmnestyInternational last week, said death squads linked to the militaryhave stepped up their violent tactics in 1988.   ``An alarming number of politically motivated summary executions,including mass executions, have been carried out by members of thestate apparatus, particularly the armed forces,'' said the U.N.report.   But it also said leftist guerrillas have persisted inassassinating people who collaborate with the armed forces.   It said guerrilla groups have ``revived the equally disturbingpractice of indiscriminate urban terrorism, which seriouslyendangers the lives and physical integrity of civilians.''   It said that the rebels' ``continuing systematic attacks on thecountry's economic infrastructure also seriously undermine thepresent and future enjoyment by Salvadoran citizens of importanteconomic, social and cultural rights.''   Meanwhile, Guillermo Ungo, an opposition candidate for president,told a news conference here Monday that there is ``no chance to havea fair election when the army controls the main politicalstructure.''   Ungo is the presidential candidate of the Democratic Convergence,a coalition of three leftist parties.   He also is president of the Democratic Revolutionary Front, whichis allied with the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, theumbrella organization of five guerrilla groups fighting theU.S.-backed government.   ``In El Salvador, as in Chile, just because there are elections,doesn't mean there is democracy,'' Ungo said in English.   He said he agreed with some aspects of the U.N. human rightsreport, but said it did not adequately recognize the problems of warand that both sides, not only the rebels, use mines and grenades.   The increased activity of death squads comes at a time whenPresident Jose Napoleon Duarte is suffering from cancer and leftistleaders are re-entering the country after guerrillas agreed to lettheir political wings participate in a March 1989 presidentialelection.   Duarte, a centrist who has vigorously opposed the death squads,is not a candidate in the election.   The U.N. report was prepared by Jose Antonio Pastor Ridruejo,special representative of the Commission on Human Rights, whichrequested an investigation.Ridruejo visited the El Salvador Oct.9-15.   The report said that armed forces occasionally kill and injurecivilians, but that guerrillas ``continue to cause more civiliandeaths and injuries than the army, as a result of the explosion ofcontact mines (and) ... guerrilla fire.''   In Washington, Amnesty International USA also noted what it saidwas ``an alarming resurgence of death squad activity'' in thecountry.   It said an average of 12 ``death squad-style'' killings per monthoccurred in El Salvador in 1987 and said that figure tripled duringthe first half of 1988, according to estimates by the Roman CatholicChurch.   More than 60,000 people have died during the 9-year-old warbetween the leftist rebels and the government.</TEXT></DOC>
