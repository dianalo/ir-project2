The founding members of the Computer Systems Policy Project areApple Computer Inc., Compaq Computer Corp., Cray Research Inc.,Hewlett-Packard Co., International Business Machines Corp., NCRCorp., Sun Microsystems Inc., Tandem Computers Inc. and Unisys Corp.   The Washington-based group's agenda overlaps with _ but sometimesdiffers from _ the priorities of existing groups such as theAmerican Electronics Association, the Semiconductor IndustryAssociation and the Computer and Business Equipment ManufacturersAssociation.   ``It's not to replace those nor to rival them in size ormagnitude. It's rather an ad hoc group that will exist for anindeterminate period of time,'' Tim Sheehy, an IBM spokesman inWashington, said Thursday.   Among other issues, Sheehy said the group would favor allowingthe U.S.-Japan semiconductor trade agreement to expire on schedulein 1991. The agreement is intended to prevent dumping of chips byJapan and open Japan's home market to foreign-made chips.   Japan is already complying with the prohibition on dumping andthe group expects it will comply with the market-opening provisionby 1991, Sheehy said. The Semiconductor Industry Association is moreskeptical about Japan's compliance, Andrew Procassini, the SIApresident, said in an interview.   Additional U.S.-owned computer makers may join the neworganization in the future, Sheehy said. Digital Equipment Corp. isthe biggest computer maker not among the founders. Digital spokesmanJoseph Codispoti said he could not immediately comment on thecompany's plans.   Sheehy said the organization is seeking a director.</TEXT></DOC>
