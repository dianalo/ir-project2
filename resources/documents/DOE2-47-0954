It is a compact lidar that allowseasy modification of components to verify their performance in the overallsystem. It performs atmospheric measurements through the window of alaboratory and thus is not optimized with respect to size, mass, andpower consumption. A fiber optics coupler connects the scanning receivingtelescope with the detector package. Thus the positioning of the detectorsbecomes uncritical for the instrument alignment, allowing use of a particularlysimple and light structure that still warrants high alignment stabilityof the components. This scanner arrangement performs well in tests andis recommended as baseline design for the spaceborne lidar. A frequency-doubledNd:YAG transmitter laser is suggested.</TEXT></DOC>
