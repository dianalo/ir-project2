Only one in six blacks said sanctions are a good idea becausethey would force the government to abolish apartheid. Six of 10blacks said they would oppose sanctions even if these led thegovernment to resign within five years.   The survey of 2,192 people _ 1,400 blacks, 392 whites and 400 ofmixed race and Asian origin _ was commissioned by the South AfricanChamber of Mines, representing the country's mining industry.   Of those polled, 82 percent of the blacks and 95 percent of thewhites rejected foreign sanctions, with most saying they would leadto higher unemployment.   Release of the survey coincided with a visit set this week byleaders of South Africa's pro-sanctions movement, including NobelPrize-winning Archbishop Desmond Tutu, seeking support fromPresident Bush and congressional leaders for proposed negotiationsbetween the black majority and the white South African governmentto end racial segregation policies.   Tom Main, chief executive of the mining association, said thestudy was commissioned to provide ``a definitive idea of the prosand cons in the sanctions debate'' as other countries considerwhether to follow the U.S. example and impose trade restrictions onSouth Africa.   Congress imposed limited sanctions on South Africa in 1986,overriding a veto by then-President Reagan, in an effort to forcethe government to grant political rights to the black majority.   Main, speaking by satellite from Johannesburg, said at a newsconference to present the Gallup survey that South Africa's coalmining industry had a drop in 1987 exports from 44 million tons to37 million but bounced back last year to post its second bestexports ever.   The sanctions resulted in the loss of 8,000 to 10,000 jobs, headded, all of them held by blacks.   The survey, conducted between March 11 and May 8, had a 4percent margin of error. Neil Upmeyer, research director forGallup, said that to ensure credibility of the responses,interviews were conducted away from the work place by interviewersof the same race as the respondent.   In the survey, 59 percent of the blacks and 51 percent of thewhites, 58 percent of all respondents, said American companies inSouth Africa can help make the government moderate its racialpolicies.   Of those polled, 77 percent of blacks and 50 percent of whitessaid ending American business operations would seriously hurt theSouth African economy.</TEXT></DOC>
