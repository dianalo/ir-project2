 They know it's not easy to get support, maintenance, supplies andpersonnel for an old machine.andP;  However, most of us would rather volunteer fororal surgery than conduct a replacement procurement.andP;  Procurements must bedone with excruciating fairness, so any convenient alternative would beappreciated.andM;Yet, with some foresight and care, we can use our existing contracts toupdate our hardware.andP;  The General Services Administration has raised thepossibility of such &quot;technology substitution&quot; in its Standard SolicitationDocument (SSD).andP;  Although options in the SSD are limited, GSA officials havesome ideas on how to update computer technology without throwing out the oldcontract.andM;To allow for technology refreshment, an agency's request for proposals (RFP)needs provisions in three essential areas.andP;  First, technology refreshmentmust be written into the clause on the scope of the contract.andP;  Becausetechnology refreshment could otherwise expand the contract, it must appear inthe scope.andM;Specifications is the second RFP item.andP;  Sections C and M of the SSD tellindustry what the government needs.andP;  Technology refreshment requirementsshould be as specific as possible, even though these are not likely torequire the detail needed in other areas of the contract.andM;The third area in the RFP to address technology refreshment is the proposalevaluation section.andP;  The evaluation section must state clearly what factorsbear on the contractor's ability to provide technology refreshment substituteproducts for the life of the contract.andP;  The relative importance of technologysubstitution, compared with other evaluation factors of the RFP, must bespelled out so offerers do not misinterpret the agency's needs.andM;Evaluation CriteriaandM;The agency's solicitation should establish four evaluation criteria fortechnology refreshment products before accepting substitutes:andM;* The substitute product must meet the same contract requirements as theproduct being replaced.andM;* The substitute product must satisfy the same technical evaluation criteriaas the old product.andP;  In other words, the new product must be technicallyacceptable according to the technical evaluation criteria in the originalRFP, as well as the technical literature provided by the contractor andincluded in the contract.andM;* The substitute technology refreshment product must pass the same tests asthe product being replaced, including any benchmark or demonstrationcriteria.andM;* The substitute product must conform to the current versions of federal,national or international standards required of the original product.andM;Of course, your agency may have other criteria to add to this list.andM;Take care that prices for the substituted technology are fair and reasonableand the pricing relationship established in the original contract applies tothe substitutions.andP;  Keep the following points in mind as you considersubstitute technology.andM;The substituted technology must represent the lowest overall cost, price andother factors considered (as the original product did at contract award).andP;  Ifthe original contract is for off-the-shelf hardware, the new product ought tobe also.andP;  Otherwise, the scope should say that commercial availability is notrequired.andM;Because the contracting officer ultimately is responsible for the soundnessof the contract, he must be satisfied with the substitution.andM;The contracting officer should negotiate a price for the new product that isthe standard commercial price less the discount given in the originalcontract.andP;  This preserves the price relationship that was the basis for thecontract award.andM;When evaluating the proposed price for the new products, the contract shouldallow an adjustment to reflect the fact that the substitute product may berelatively young in its life cycle.andP;  The costs of developing new productsusually get front-loaded into the product price.andP;  The contracting officer mayneed this incentive to attract current technology.andM;The contract should limit the sum of upgrades to a stated percentage of thevalue of the contract.andM;Apply these ideas with caution because they are relatively new and untried.andO;However, if you can update your hardware without a major reprocurement, youcan save much time and effort.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
