Jefferson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ECO TRA REL ENV CON </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The booming economy of this city and its environs will continue into the first decade of the next century, creating three million new jobs as the population swells 35% to 18.1 million, a new study says.    The study also foresees a smog-bound urban nightmare of crawling traffic and horrendous housing and education conditions if steps to mitigate growth-related problems aren't taken now.    The study by the Los Angeles 2000 Committee, a group of more than 150 civic and business leaders, identifies future threats to a five-county area of Southern California and offers a wish-list of solutions, including:   --New transportation and freeway projects costing $16.3 billion.    --A nonprofit housing trust fund, financed by corporations and others, to help build $4 billion to $12 billion of housing needed to stop the flight away from the city's job-rich center.    --A $4.8 billion project over the next 30 years to increase by 250% the capacity of the city's ports, already the nation's busiest.    --A more-holistic environmental master plan, replacing current piecemeal approaches to problems in this heavily polluted area.    --A radical move toward regional government to attack traffic, smog and other ills that cross city boundaries.    The fastest-growing sector of Southern California's economy -- with $290 billion of goods and services that already ranks it 11th in the world if calculated as gross national product -- will remain business and professional services, including banking, insurance and real estate.    The report predicted vast ethnic divisions as the population mix changes. No group will represent a majority by 2010, with Hispanics and whites each making up about 40%. Hispanic and black workers will continue to fill technical and craft jobs in manufacturing, more vulnerable to plant closings, changing technology and closures from environmental regulations. A growing Asian minority is pictured as increasingly taking professional positions in electronics and banking industries.    To help close the gap of an evolving &quot;bimodal&quot; work force between high-skill and low-skill workers, more literacy programs were recommended, along with expanded partnerships linking business with school programs and increased minority-teacher recruitment.    Crime, identified as the worst problem here, would be attacked by a county-court reorganization and a reform of the sentencing system, along with $300 million spent on education and child care. </TEXT></DOC>
