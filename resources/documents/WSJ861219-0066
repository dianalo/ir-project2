Many traders had expected the announcement by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, but reaction was limited by the lack of market players. The dollar traded within a narrow range throughout the day.    &quot;At this time of a year, it had a minimal impact on the market,&quot; said James T. McGroarty, vice president of foreign exchange at Discount Corp. of New York. &quot;The market doesn't seem to be focusing on much of anything.&quot;    Lower West German interest rates -- or an expected decline in rates -- would make dollar-denominated investments relatively more attractive, increasing demand for dollars. With a decline in West German rates ruled out, demand for dollars should slacken.    News that the Bundesbank will try to keep the nation's monetary growth within 3% to 6% next year fell within market expectations and generated little reaction.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 2.0056 West German marks, down from 2.0150 Wednesday. The dollar eased to 162.92 Japanese yen from 163.48. The British pound firmed to $1.4313 from $1.4297.    In early trading in Tokyo Friday the dollar rose against the Japanese currency to 162.96 yen from 162.92 in New York yesterday afternoon.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $2.60 an ounce, to $394.80, in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 2.3 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $394.35 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                        CURRENCY RATES                           New York    Home Mkt.
