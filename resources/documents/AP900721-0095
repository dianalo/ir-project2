Trcka, manager of the Coralville Pizza Hut, is part of afive-member team leaving Aug. 1 to train 300 Soviets to make pizzafor the chain's next restaurants.   ``I've never been overseas. It will be quite the adventure forme,'' she said. ``It's kind of a mystery. I can picture myselflying on the beach in Mexico, maybe, but I can't see myself inMoscow.''   When she learned last spring that she had been selected from5,300 managers to make the trip, Trcka enrolled in an eight-weeklanguage class at Kirkwood Community College.   ``The thing I fear most is the language barrier. My favoritephrase is going to be `I do not speak Russian,''' Trcka said. Themanagement team will train Soviet employees through interpreters.   Pizza Hut, owned by Pepsico Inc., plans to open two restaurantsin Moscow by the end of August.   One Pizza Hut will be in surburban Moscow and will seat 325people. ``It's about five times the size of my little CoralvilleHut,'' Trcka said.   The second will be near the recently opened McDonald's and willseat about 80 people.   It won't be the first time Muscovites have been exposed topizza. Two New Jerseyites, Louis Piancone Sr. of Newark andUkranian-born entrepreneur Shelley M. Zeiger of Moorestown, entereda joint venture with Soviet officials in 1987 to take the company'sAstro Pizza mobile concession truck to Moscow. The truck beganselling to tourists and Soviet customers in April 1988.   Trcka, along with managers from Florida, Illinois and New York,will spend three weeks training the 300 workers selected to staffthe two Pizza Huts from about 6,000 applicants. In Coralville, asuburb of Iowa City in eastern Iowa, Trcka oversees a crew of 25.   ``I've heard the Soviet people are very friendly and really taketo Americans,'' she said. ``McDonald's broke some ground as far assmiling and such. They're getting used to Western culture.''   But while McDonald's emphasizes fast food, ``We're going toconcentrate more on service and family dining.''   The restaurants will offer carryout service, ``a totally newconcept for the Soviet Union,'' Ms. Trcka said. ``If all goes well,they'll consider delivery, too.''</TEXT></DOC>
