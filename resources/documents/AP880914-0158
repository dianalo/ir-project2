Everett Koop said Wednesday.   Interviewed after an address to the 1,500 employees ofIndependence Blue Cross, Koop said a move toward more hospice carewould have to come from a public-private partnership betweengovernments and private insurers.   ``The public and private sectors have to get together. ... Afrank discussion of what AIDS will cost, how insurance fits in, andthe terminally ill needing a place to stay,'' he said.   Thirty hospitals in the Philadelphia area recently reported a$1.6 million yearly loss from treating AIDS patients. Asked ifhospitals were being shortchanged, Koop said there is a need tomove patients from a high-technology setting to hospice care tosave costs during the final stages of the disease.   Hospices are homelike facilities that provide support forterminally ill patients. Medical care stresses relief of painrather than efforts to prolong life.   Koop said the stigma attached to AIDS has caused financialproblems for hospitals partly because some patients, fearful othersmight think they have AIDS, have stayed away from institutionsknown for treating people with the disease.   Some insurance companies don't insure AIDS treatment and inareas where government has required them to, like the District ofColumbia, the insurance companies leave town, he said.   ``The public sector has provided enough money'' for AIDS care,he said.   During his speech, the surgeon general reiterated his call forAIDS prevention through sexual abstinence, monogamy or condom useand warned that free-needle programs will not wipe out the deadlydisease among intravenous drug abusers. He said camaraderie amongdrug abusers leads to the sharing of needles and the potentialspread of AIDS.   His two-hour speech and question-and-answer session to thePhiladelphia-based insurance company was also beamed to cablesubscribers nationwide, to Canada, Mexico and other parts of SouthAmerica and to Philadelphia's public school students.   From September 1987 to this month, 31,000 new cases of patientssuffering from the symptoms of the disease have been diagnosed inthe United States, Koop said. There have been 73,000 AIDS cases,41,000 of whom have died, reported worldwide since 1981, he said.   Depending on the prevalence of AIDS in the area, the chances ofreceiving a unit of blood infected with the virus are one in 40,000to one in 250,000, he said.   About 900 children have been born infected with the virus, hesaid.   Asked if there was a danger from vials containing AIDS-infectedblood washing up on beaches, Koop said exposure to salt waterinhibits the virus' ability to grow in a bloodstream or in alaboratory.   ``It's sort of icky to go swimming with a bunch of dirtybandages floating around, but it won't kill you,'' he said.   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is most frequently spreadthough sexual contact with a partner infected with the virus orsharing intravenous drug needles.</TEXT></DOC>
