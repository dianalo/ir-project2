A method for solving two-dimensional (2D), piston-like displacementfor incompressible fluids with good accuracy has been developed. Severaltypical example problems with repeated five-spot patterns were solvedfor various mobility ratios. The solutions were compared with the analyticalsolutions to demonstrate accuracy. Singularity programming was foundto be a major advantage in handling flow in the vicinity of wells. TheBIM was found to be an excellent way to solve immiscible displacementproblems. Unlike analytic methods, it can accommodate complex boundaryshapes and does not suffer from numerical dispersion at the front.</TEXT></DOC>
