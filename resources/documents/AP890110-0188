Historic political reforms passed into law Dec. 1 said``conditions would be created for nomination of an unlimited numberof candidates'' for the Congress of People's Deputies, the newSoviet parliament.   Two-thirds of the 2,250 deputies are to be elected by the publicMarch 26. One-third are being chosen by organizations _ includingthe Communist Party, which has 100 seats, and trade unions andscientific groups.   But based on the Central Committee action Tuesday, party memberswill have no choice in electing their deputies, since only 100candidates were nominated.   In a speech delivered before the decision, President Mikhail S.Gorbachev said 312 names remaining from tens of thousands submittedhad gone to the ruling 12-member Politburo, and it reduced the listto 100 before sending it to the Central Committee.   No change has been made in the language of the new election law,but the party's example ``will set the standard'' and otherorganizations will be less likely to offer real choices, a Westerndiplomat said on condition of anonymity.   Multiple candidates already have been nominated in some areas.Tass, the official news agency, said 26 candidates were chosen in 19Moscow districts.   Other signals from Tuesday's meeting of the party CentralCommittee were conflicting.   Gorbachev, who has promised repeatedly that the elections will bepart of his ``democratization'' of the Soviet Union, offered a draftpolitical platform for the party and suggested other organizationswould offer their own.   ``The Soviet people are entitled to know the objectives and tasksformulated by the party for the immediate future, and the platformit takes to elections,'' Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying. Thedocument was not released Tuesday.   ``We should proceed from the premise that the other socialorganizations will come to the elections with their own campaigndocuments,'' and individual candidates can also offer their views,Gorbachev said.   He was referring to other national organizations, including tradeunions and scientific groups, which have been empowered to directlyelect deputies to the congress. The Communist Party is the onlylegal political party in the Soviet Union.   Gorbachev also expressed satisfaction that most candidatesnominated so far in the three-month election campaign are supportersof perestroika, his policy of reforming the Soviet system.   But the president complained the campaign has produced``manifestations of group egotism, ambition and politicalcareerism,'' and worried that some candidates might play on ethnicdisputes.   Under the political reform adopted in December, the new congresswill meet once a year to elect a smaller working parliament of 424members.   Gorbachev said that party members had suggested 31,500 nomineesfor its seats in the new congress. But these were winnowed down andfinally just 100 were chosen by the 12-member ruling Politburo.   Those 100 candidates were nominated by the party's 300-memberCentral Committee Tuesday, Tass said.   A Western diplomat said it was possible that others could benominated at the last minute.   Tass said that before the party formally elects its 100 deputies,``all communists will have an opportunity to express their attitudeto any of the candidates.''   But even then, rank-and-file party members won't even have thechance to vote, Tass said. Only party leaders will cast ballots in aspecial meeting March 15-16.   Those empowered to vote for the party's legislators will bemembers of its Central Committee, its auditing commission, firstsecretaries of the republic and regional party organizations, secondsecretaries of the republic party organizations, presidents andprime ministers of the republics, ministers and heads of stateagencies, and commanders of military districts, Tass said.</TEXT></DOC>
