KCNC-TV insists it received a videotape of the fight in the mail.   The allegations arose from a four-part series on illegal dogfights compiled by KCNC reporter Wendy Bergen and two video cameraoperators. In Colorado, staging a dog fight or attending one is afelony punishable by up to four years in prison and a maximum$1,000 fine.   One of the series of reports _ broadcast April 29 through May 2during a ratings ``sweep'' period _ featured the fight between twounmuzzled dogs that police say occurred on a grassy area near theSouth Platte River in Sheridan, a Denver suburb.   After the report, sources telephoned some competing Denver TVstations and a newspaper with claims the fight was staged for KCNCand that the station paid for it. Their reports identified thesources only as current or former KCNC employees.   KCNC general manager Roger Ogden on Wednesday denied the claims,saying the station received unsolicited tape of the fightanonymously in the mail.   Investigations were launched by the Sheridan and Lakewood policedepartments and the district attorney's offices in Arapahoe andJefferson counties.   Sheridan is in Arapahoe County, and Lakewood, the hometown of aman who allegedly owns one of the fighting pit bulls, is inJefferson County.   ``We are close to concluding our investigation,'' Lakewoodpolice spokesman John Hunt said. ``We expect, within the next fewdays perhaps, to have some sort of statement.''   Ogden said an internal investigation is underway at theNBC-affiliated station, and the network also is looking into thematter, said NBC spokesman Richard Cutting in New York.   The station has released edited tapes of the four-part series topolice. Police say they identified the owner of one of the pitbulls involved, but declined to identify him.   The tapes showed people at the dog fight, but their faces weredistorted to protect their identities, said Robin Duxbury,executive director of the Rocky Mountain Humane Society.   The organization has called for advertisers to boycott thestation until it releases the unedited versions of the tapes. KCNCnews director Marv Rockford declined to say whether the stationwould release the tapes.   The organization sent letters to businesses this week, askingthem to boycott KCNC, but it was too early to measure the effort'ssuccess, she said.   Ms. Bergen has declined to be interviewed.   Ratings sweeps periods take place four times a year and arecrucial to local stations because they help determine localadvertising rates.   The controversy heightened local debate over the pressure-cookereffect of the sweeps on news operations.   ``The staging of news is unethical, period,'' David Bartlett,president of the Radio and Television News Directors Association,said from Washington. He declined to speak specifically about theDenver case until the investigations are completed.</TEXT></DOC>
