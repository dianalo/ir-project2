Hessel's March 15 letter to the editor indicates that Jesse Jackson's proposal to increase marginal tax rates by 10 percentage points to 38% for taxpayers earning more than $190,000 a year merely would bring the marginal rate at this income level to where it was before the current, recently reduced rates took effect.    Mr. Hessel apparently has not read the 1986 Tax Reform Act that, in exchange for lower rates, eliminated a mass of legitimate expense deductions for taxpayers. The elimination of these deductions combined with an increase in tax rates back to 38% not only soaks the rich, but it is a fraud against taxpayers.    D.
