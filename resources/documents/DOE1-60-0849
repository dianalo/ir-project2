It has largelyreplaced radionuclide brain imaging as the initial, noninvasive neurologicscreening examination. Although conventional radionuclide brain imagingstill contributes useful and unique diagnostic information in a few clinicalsituations, it appears that new technology and applications must be foundif nuclear imaging is to play a prominent future role in neurologic diagnosisas it did in the past. One of the main advantages of CT over radionuclidebrain imaging at present is CT's ability to demonstrate the size, shape,and position of the cerebral ventricles and subarachnoid spaces. Anotherimportant strength of CT is the ability to differentiate ischemic cerebralinfarction from intracerebral hemorrhage. The overall sensitivity ofCT in detecting intracranial neoplasms is also greater than that of radionuclidebrain imaging, and CT is very useful in demonstrating the effects ofhead trauma. Magnetic resonance imaging appears superior to CT in theevaluation of neurologic disorders. A renewed interest in radionuclidebrain imaging has developed because of recent advances in emission computedtomographic imaging. When tracer kinetic models are used, cerebral bloodflow (CBF), blood volume, metabolic rate, and glucose and amino acidtransport can be measured. Other applications involve investigation ofreceptor bindings, evaluation of the blood-brain barrier, brain blood-volumemeasurement, and cisternography.</TEXT></DOC>
