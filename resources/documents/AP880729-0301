Another firm, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., disclosed that up tothree former brokers may have traded improperly on advanceknowledge of the information as well.   And R.R. Donnelley andamp; Sons Co. of Chicago, one of the companiesthat prints Business Week, said federal authorities had subpoenaedlists of its employees at two printing plants near the officeswhere the affected brokers worked.   The moves came a day after Merrill Lynch Inc. said it had fireda broker because of suspicious trades surrounding stocks touted inBusiness Week.   Prudential-Bache said it had dismissed Brian Callahan, a brokerin its 33-member office in Anaheim, Calif., after it detectedquestionable trading by him. The firm said it had notified theSecurities and Exchange Commission, the federal agency thatenforces securities laws.   Peter Costiglio, a spokesman at Prudential-Bache's headquartersin New York, said Callahan, 28, had worked for the firm for about3{ years.   Executives at Prudential-Bache's Anaheim office referred allqueries about Callahan to Costiglio, who said he did not know thewhereabouts of the broker.   Directory assistance said there was no listing for a BrianCallahan in Anaheim.   Advest, based in Hartford, Conn., said the broker it suspendedworked in the firm's office in New London, Conn., where 10 brokersare based. Spokeswoman Martha Payne declined to disclose thebroker's identity or career history.   ``The suspension was the result of an internal investigationwhich we conducted,'' she said. ``We've notified the Securities andExchange Commission. The investigation is continuing.''   Shearson said in a statement that an undisclosed number ofex-brokers in the Hartford, Conn., office of E.F. Hutton GroupInc., which Shearson acquired last December, ``may have acceptedand executed trades based on advance knowledge of articles thatwere published in Business Week.''   A source at Shearson, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidat least one and possibly three brokers were involved, but saidtheir whereabouts were not clear.   The statement said the questionable trades occured prior to theacquisition and the brokers are no longer with the company. It saidthe SEC and New York Stock Exchange had been notified but providedno further details.   The disclosures widened to four the number of brokeragesinvolved since Business Week, the nation's leading business weeklywith a circulation of nearly 1 million, said last week it wasinvestigating whether stock trading was occuring based on leaks ofits unpublished ``Inside Wall Street'' columns.   Evidence uncovered so far suggests that workers who printBusiness Week shared information about the market-moving columnswith brokers before the magazine was available to the public.   Two of the four plants that publish Business Week are in OldSaybrook, Conn., near New London; and in Torrance, Calif., nearAnaheim.   Business Week officials have said there is no indication thatany of the magazine's editorial staff is involved.   Lawyers likened the situation to the securities fraud casebrought against former Wall Street Journal reporter R. FosterWinans, who sold tips about his impending stock columns to brokerPeter N. Brant. Both were convicted for trading based on stolenconfidential information.   Merrill Lynch said Thursday it had fired broker William Dillonfrom its New London office after investigating a pattern ofsuspicious trading he conducted on stocks featured in ``Inside WallStreet.''   Dillon did not return phone calls to his home in Old Lyme,Conn., seeking comment.   People familiar with Merrill's internal probe, who spoke oncondition they not be identified, also said a second broker in thefirm's New London office, James Smith, was under investigation butno disciplinary action had been taken against him. Smith'ssecretary said he was unavailable for comment.   Business Week, published by McGraw-Hill Inc., said on July 21that its legal counsel was examining the entire operation forpossible leaks.   The magazine has retained a high-powered New York detectiveagency, Kroll Associates, to assist its investigation. Kroll hasbeen involved in several major securities probes, particularlythose involving insider trading, proxy fights and hostile takeovers.   Business Week ackowledged it was investigating possible leaksafter Dow Jones Professional Investor Report made the initialdisclosure about possible misuse of information in the column.   Professional Investor Report said its analysis of 20 stocksmentioned in the column had found at least eight rose sharply theday the magazines came off the presses but before they wereavailable to the public.   The SEC and the major stock exchanges also are investigating thematter.   Donnelley, which operates the Old Saybrook and Torrance plants,said that it was conducting its own investigation into possibleleaks and that anyone accused of wrongdong faced disciplinaryaction.   James Ratcliffe, a spokesman for Donnelley, said Friday that theSEC had subpoenaed lists of employee names and addresses at the twoplants and that the firm's own investigators had intervewed morethan 21 workers.</TEXT></DOC>
