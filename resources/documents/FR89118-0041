Theestablishment of a resource assessment database will also allow the state,operators, and the DOE to better evaluate the state reservoirs and theremaining hydrocarbon resources. The intended research will (1) developan Alabama oil and gas database for evaluating resources available frominfill drilling and/or enhanced recovery, (2) characterize carbonate reservoirheterogeneity and fluid properties important to defining potential additionalreserves, (3) apply the criteria for recognizing carbonate reservoir heterogeneitiesto the Smackover formation, and, (4) transfer the technologies to oil operatorsthrough publication's and workshops. The Geological Survey of Alabama (GSA)will make available to this research project the state well records, geologicaldata archives, well samples, petrographic equipment, and computer resources.In accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i) (B) and (D), the GSA has beenselected as the grant recipient. This activity would be conducted by theGSA using their own resources; however, DOE support of the activity wouldenhance the public benefits to be derived by allowing more thorough coverageof the state's reservoirs. Additionally, GSA has exclusive domestic capabilityto perform this activity. By conducting similar multidisciplinary reservoirstudies of Alabama reservoirs, the GSA has become a unique repository ofwell record and sample information for the state of Alabama.The term of the grant is for a three-year period at an estimated valueof $1,310,000.00. This funding level will be equally shared between DOEand the State of Alabama.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>U.S. Department of Energy, PittsburghEnergy Technology Center, Attn: David N.
