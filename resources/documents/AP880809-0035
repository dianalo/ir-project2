(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A U.S. appeals court ruling upholding alaw requiring minors seeking abortions to notify both parents orget judicial permission will have disastrous effects, a civilliberties lawyer says.   But a leader of Minnesota's largest anti-arbortion lobby saidthe ruling will provide needed safeguards for pregnant teen-agers.   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis, by a 7-3vote, overturned decisions by a federal judge and a three-judgepanel of the appeals court. The earlier rulings deemed the lawunconstitutional.   Rachael Pine, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Unionin New York, called Monday's ruling was ``a disaster for minors inthe state of Minnesota.'' The ACLU brought the class action lawsuiton behalf of minors, a parent, four clinics and two physicians.   Jackie Schwietz, executive director of Minnesota CitizensConcerned for Life, an anti-abortion group, said the ruling``affirms the right of minor girls to have their parents involvedin this important medical decision.''   ``It's always amazed me that abortionists performing surgery ona child would do so without knowing the impact on her health,''Schwietz said. ``There's no way you can get an adequate history onthe girl without parental involvement. There are facts that mayonly be available to the abortionist from the parents.''   U.S. District Judge Donald Alsop of St. Paul in November 1986barred the state from enforcing the notification law. Alsop saidthe required 48-hour notice to both parents unduly burdened aminor's right to seek an abortion, particularly when the pregnantgirl does not live with both parents.   But Appeals Judge John R. Gibson, writing for the majority, saidthe U.S. Supreme Court ``has recognized as a matter of law thatparental notice or consent requirements do not unconstitutionallyburden a minor's abortion rights when an appropriate judicialbypass is in place.''   The Supreme Court legalized abortion in its landmark 1973decision based on women's right to control her body. But in 1981,it allowed states to impose parental-notification requirements for``immature'' girls still dependent on their parents.   Pine said the Minnesota case was the nation's first in which thecourts considered a law involving restrictions on minors' access toabortion that had been enforced.   ``All other cases before the Supreme Court and lower courts havebeen challenges brought before the laws took effect,'' Pine said.``The others were based on speculation.''   Pine said a decision whether to appeal the ruling to the U.S.Supreme Court was being considered.   Twenty-five states have laws that require minors seekingabortions to notify or to obtain consent from at least one parent,Pine said. Most of them allow minors to seek judicial approval toget around the parental notification or consent requirement.   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Donald Lay said the majority``completely ignores the evidence amassed in a five-week trial andthe district court's findings of fact as irrelevant to theconstitutional issues.''   The majority, Lay said, ``has created a new right, apparently ofconstitutional dimension, for non-custodial parents to receivenotice of their minor children's activities.'' Upholding the48-hour waiting period, Lay said, was ``contrary to nearly everyother court decision on this issue.''</TEXT></DOC>
