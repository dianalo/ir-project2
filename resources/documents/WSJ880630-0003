Cenith, a Boston-based investment group, owns about 10% of Ionics's 3.7 million common shares outstanding. A spokesman said to acquire Ionics, a maker of purification equipment, Cenith would buy Ionics's shares and common stock warrants in a transaction with an indicated value of more than $90 million. The spokesman added that the debentures used to acquire Ionics's shares would be issued by a new company formed to make the acquisition.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Ionics's shares closed at $19.375, up 62.5 cents.    Cenith's proposal is subject to availability of financing, approval by Ionics's board and other conditions, Ionics said.    As previously reported, Ionics last year rejected a request by Cenith to discuss a $17-a-share proposal. Arthur L. Goldstein, Ionics president and chief executive officer, said, &quot;I continue to believe that the interests of the stockholders would not be served by any transaction such as that suggested by Cenith.&quot; He added, however, that Ionics's board will consider Cenith's latest proposal &quot;in due course.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
