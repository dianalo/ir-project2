The Antarctic Protection Act of 1990 was one of eight measuresBush signed Friday that are intended to also protect theenvironment in the Florida Keys, Louisiana, New Jersey, the Nevadadesert and coastal regions, as well as provide money for globalwarming research, clean up the Great Lakes and provide grants forenvironmental education.   The Antarctic law will ban indefinitely U.S. mineral activitiesin the region until a new international minerals agreement isapproved by Congress. That agreement would first have to be workedout by an international conference.   Bush's action came three days before the start of a conferencein Chile where 24 countries will take up the future of Antarctica.   Environmental groups have urged the president to commit theUnited States to joining other nations, including France, Australiaand New Zealand, that want to make a permanently protected worldpark in the frozen continent.   U.S. officials say they oppose the permanent ban, urging insteadan international compact for a limited moratorium on oil drillingand other minerals development.   They said a long-term moratorium was the preferred middle groundbetween those nations wanting to block mining forever and those,like the United States, unwilling to rule it out.   Environmentalists claim that the indefinite ban merely givesindustry time to prepare the technology for eventual developmentand mining.   But the White House touted Bush's action on Friday as``advocating a forceful environmental protection agreement tosupplement the Antarctic Treaty'' that has been in effect since1959.   ``Clearly, all of us must work together to preserve America'snatural beauty,'' Bush said at a ceremony on the South Lawn of theWhite House to sign the Antarctic bill and seven others.   He also signed measures to:   -Establish the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary,designating 2,600 square miles off the keys as a national marinesanctuary.   -Establish national wildlife refuges in the 18,000-acre BayouCocodrie in Louisiana and the 7,500-acre Walkill River area of NewJersey, and fund additional marine research programs and stepped upenforcement by the Environmental Protection Agency.   -Designate 83,100 acres in southern Nevada's Mojave Desert asthe Red Rock Canyon National Conservation area.   -Nearly triple the size of the Coastal Barrier Resource Systemby adding 818,000 acres to the system along the atlantic, Gulf ofMexico and Great Lakes coasts. The measure also limits federalfunds for development within the coastal barrier areas and requiresthat any federal property in the coastal barrier regions betransferred to the system.   -Provide grants and training to teachers for environmentaleducation and create an office of environmental education at theEnvironmental Protection Agency.   -Fund research on the global warming trend. The administration,bucking many of its allies, contends there is insufficientscientific data to confirm that the earth is slowly warming due togaseous emissions. Rather than committing itself to a reduction ofthose gases, the administration is putting more money intoresearch.   -Assist in the cleanup of toxic pollution in the Great Lakes andLake Champlain.</TEXT></DOC>
