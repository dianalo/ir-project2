On the rostrum, a socialist is calling passionately for the use of the word &quot;God&quot; in a new national constitution. His colleagues mill in the aisles and ignore him -- even the evangelists.    It's a fitting start to the congressional vote on Brazil's new constitution, which will replace the one imposed by the military government in 1967. Just about everything involving the new constitution is happening behind schedule and against a backdrop of legislative near-paralysis and deep public disillusionment.    In the coming weeks, congressmen are supposed to decide questions of long-term national importance: whether the state should be the ultimate provider of social justice, whether the country should convert to a parliamentary government, whether bosses should be allowed to fire workers at will, whether to nationalize certain sectors of the economy.    But by far, the most divisive issue is fleeting: whether the new constitution should call for a presidential election this year. President Jose Sarney opposes that, insisting on an extra, fifth year.    &quot;The range of topics isn't the problem&quot; bogging down the Constitutional Congress, says political analyst Bolivar Lamounier. &quot;The problem is the interference of Mr. Sarney in the Congress, trying to get his five-year term. This reduces the attention given to economic and social issues, and creates an atmosphere of demoralization for democratic procedures.&quot;    Inflation-weary Brazilians want a new president as soon as possible. Yet in the Constitutional Congress, blatant pork-barreling has bought majority support for an amendment that would give Mr. Sarney his fifth year. Other work in Congress has slowed to a crawl while the Sarney-backers have pieced together the fragile majority. Even as the debate was ringing out last week over the word &quot;God,&quot; for instance, politicians were working behind the scenes to rearrange the voting schedule to favor the fifth year.    &quot;The country is paralyzed,&quot; says Mr. Lamounier, who directs the Sao Paulo Institute for Economic, Social and Political Studies. &quot;The government can't deal with inflation. The government can't present a serious proposal for negotiating the foreign debt. We are completely blocked by Mr. Sarney and his crowd.&quot; The latest promises to control government spending and pay foreign creditors some interest are a far cry from the structural reforms he deems necessary.    For weeks, leading newspapers have been filled with articles exposing the radio-broadcast rights and other concessions being handed out to politicians who line up votes behind the five-year term. Mr. Lamounier notes that one federal development agency, the Community Action Secretariat, spent 41% of its budget last year on projects in a single state, Minas Gerais, where the governor is one of Mr. Sarney's most outspoken advocates. Meanwhile, the impoverished northeastern state of Pernambuco, where the governor supports a four-year term, received not a cent.    Sao Paulo State Congressman Robson Marinho tells of helping a priest from his state, who sought support for his work with alcoholics, to get an audience with the Planning Ministry's chief of staff. The official &quot;asked me if I had signed the amendment for five years,&quot; says Mr. Marinho. &quot;And when I answered that I hadn't, he handed me a copy to be signed. When I refused, he simply turned to the priest and told him he would have to get a better godfather, one who would defend five years, if he wanted to see his request attended to.&quot;    Earlier last week, another congressman, Robertao (Big Robert) Cardoso Alves, a member of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, justified the horse-trading with a quote from St. Francis of Assisi, the saint who found joy in a life of poverty. &quot;For it is in giving that we receive,&quot; the congressman quoted the saint as saying, meaning that by giving their votes to the five-year term, politicians should receive jobs and other favors.    &quot;Even God imposes conditions to go to heaven,&quot; he says. &quot;Anyone who doesn't vote for the five years should have to give back all the jobs they got from the government. Even those who say they didn't get jobs -- because they did.&quot;    Says Mr. Lamounier, the political analyst: &quot;Obviously, Brazil isn't like Switzerland. But what is happening is shocking even to us.&quot;    The length of Mr. Sarney's term mightn't be such a divisive issue if it weren't for the freakish way he became president and for the economy's deterioration under his leadership. After the military government stepped down in 1985, an electoral college selected Tancredo Neves, a Social Democrat and a statesman of national stature, to be the country's new civilian president. But Mr. Neves died before taking office, vaulting Mr. Sarney, his running mate, to the presidency.    Mr. Sarney had an early success with the anti-inflationary Cruzado Plan, but it unraveled. Triple-digit inflation returned, and his popularity evaporated. Brazilians are now highly conscious that Mr. Sarney originally promised to stay in office only four years. Then he broke his pledge and insisted on a six-year term, as his military predecessors had. Last year, he said that in the spirit of compromise, he would stay for only five years.    Some analysts theorize that Mr. Sarney, to restore his self-respect, wants to stay in office long enough to recoup the ground he has lost to inflation. The less-generous explanation has it that pork-barreling has run so wild that it will take an extra year to carry out all the deals.    Meanwhile, economists are predicting monthly inflation rates of at least 15% for the next few months. Former Central Bank President Affonso Celso Pastore says he expects monthly inflation of 17.5% in February, 18.5% in March, and then &quot;a jump&quot; toward hyperinflation.    &quot;People aren't as apathetic as they seem,&quot; says Mr. Lamounier. &quot;People are a bit perplexed about all the things that have happened in the last two years, so there is a temporary withdrawal. But I am convinced that in four to six months, we are going to have enormous social convulsions.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
