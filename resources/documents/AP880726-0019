William Donald Schaefer, said about an hourafter ambulances were sent to the Maryland Penitentiary in downtownBaltimore.   State Police spokesman Cpl. Greg Shipley said no prisonersescaped.   Schaefer met Monday night with the prison warden and stateprison officials, and said afterward that he was satisfied withtheir handling of the disturbance.   Shipley said the disturbance began in the recreation yardshortly before 1 p.m, spread to a crisis clinic where thepsychologist was having a session with inmates, and erupted againin another section of the yard. He said a minor fire also was setin the clinic.   Baltimore police carrying shotguns immediately surrounded theperimeter of the prison, and a police helicopter flew overhead.Several downtown streets were blocked off, causing traffic backups.   Prison officials did not know the reason for the three incidentsand do not think they were organized, Shipley said.   Two homemade knives were recovered, and several gunshots alsowere fired, he said.   Officials said the prison immediately was ``locked down,'' withinmates locked in their cells.   Two inmates, one in critical condition and one in fair, werebeing treated for gunshot wounds, said Anita Hisley, spokeswomanfor Johns Hopkins Hospital. The third inmate was being treated atthe prison hospital, which handles less-serious injuries, officialssaid.   One of the eight injured guards suffered a gunshot wound to theneck, but authorities believe he may have been wounded by anotherofficer during the melee. He and two other guards werehospitalized, while the others were treated and released.   The psychologist was treated for facial injuries and released.   The problem apparently resulted from an altercation thatpossibly followed an aborted escape attempt, said Bill Bowlander,executive director of Council 92 of the American Federation ofState, County and Municipal Employees, which representscorrectional officers.   The penitentiary, which opened in 1811, ordinarily holds 700 to800 men, but Monday's inmate count was 1,270. Eighteen of itsinmates are on death row.</TEXT></DOC>
