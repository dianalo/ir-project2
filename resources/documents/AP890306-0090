SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A group of scientists concerned aboutthreatened changes in the Earth's climate called Monday for morefederal spending on research.   ``Given the enormous momentum in the Earth's climate system, wedelay response actions at our peril,'' said the report from theClimate Institute, a private group which seeks to coordinateinterests of public and private researchers and officials.   A committee convened by the institute recommended approval ofPresident Bush's proposed $190.5 million request for global changeresearch, plus federal support totaling about $170 million for aseries of additional efforts.   The panel cited the recent series of unusually warm years, whichsome believe are a result of a greenhouse effect on Earth'senvironment.   ``If this strong warming trend is, as some very crediblescientists believe, the beginning of a significant and rapidgreenhouse warming, humanity may soon be faced with some vexingchallenges,'' the committee concluded.   The greenhouse theory contends that increasing levels of carbondioxide and other gases in the atmosphere are causing the planet'sclimate to warm up, by trapping the sun's heat in somewhat the way agreenhouse traps heat inside.   Scientists disagree over whether the recent warm years are theresult of normal variations in climate or the first signs of agreenhouse effect.   If the warming turns out to be a trend, it could pose suchproblems as changes in the regions where agriculture succeeds,relocation of forests, melting of polar ice and raising sea levels,stronger hurricanes and other weather and climate changes.   ``Unfortunately, the nations of the world are woefully short of aclear understanding of fundamental processes at work in theatmosphere, oceans and biosphere,'' reported the committee headed byGordon J. MacDonald of the Mitre Corp.   Among the projects that the committee urged, in addition to theBush budget recommendations for climate research, were:   _A $14 million program to accelerate the phase-out ofchlorofluorocarbons, chemicals blamed for damaging the protectiveozone layer and which also add to the greenhouse warming.   _Studies of the impact of sea-level rise, totaling $25 million.   _Some $1.5 million for health impact studies.   _Upgrading the volunteer weather network and setting up regionalclimate centers, $12.2 million.   _A $14 million national greenhouse gas monitoring system.   _Forest Service research on global change totaling $17 million.   _Some $21 million for international studies of climate warmingimpact.   _A $20 million United Nations program for climate research in theThird World.</TEXT></DOC>
