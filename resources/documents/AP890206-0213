Ms. Rigsby, who lives with her 8-year-old granddaughter, says shewould not want her to get near Jason. She opposed his entry intoregular classes. ``It's too contagious, and I don't know enoughabout it.''   ``Nobody harassed her in this neighborhood,'' says Alice Perkins,34, who lived next door to the family for nearly 10 years. ``Therewas no vigilante group.   ``She's trying to write a book and she wants a grand finale aboutGranite City. I'm glad she's moved because someone else can have allthis fun that we had.''   With family permission, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch printed thephone number.   To protest state cuts in funding for hemophiliacs, Mrs. Robertsoncontacted two newspapers, including the Post-Dispatch, and thefamily's life became public record.   ``I did not comprehend that it would be this big of an issue,''says Mrs. Robertson. ``Maybe we made some mistakes. I was doing whatwas best for my kids.''   Stu Mills, the Granite City district's supervisor of specialeducational programs, described her as ``volatile.'' She ofteninitiated confrontations. But he said he had sympathy for any parentin Mrs. Robertson's situation.   He said that the mother of an AIDS child thinks she has speciallicense to say whatever she wants, even characterizing one town asthe good guys and the other the bad.   Mrs. Robertson says the family decided to leave Granite Cityafter a man accosted her and hit her on the head with a stick.   They moved to South Roxana, a oil refinery town of 2,300 nearby,to the home where Jason's father, who manages a plastics company,grew up. It was a good move for Jason.   ``He just smiles all over,'' says Sharon Waters, a teacher's aideand registered nurse hired for Jason's second-grade room at the375-student South Roxana Elementary School.   ``His little eyes just dance; they talk more than he does,'' shesays. ``I think he's happy. Just to see him play, like when he getsthe right answer, he gets real excited.''   At first, she said, Jason didn't know how to deal with hisclassmates, because he had had only limited contact with childrenhis age for nearly two years. But they encouraged him and in days hemade friends.   South Roxana Principal Dorothy Stickels calls Jason an ``averagesecond-grader'' in a class of 24. His writing has improved and heseldom misses school, she said. ``I see him every morning with hisback pack and a smile on his face.''   But the school lost eight students because of Jason's attendance.Fear of AIDS again.   Jason's mother says her new neighbors are quick to offer support.``They said, `We want you to stop running. Make this your home.'''she said.   Many of the new neighbors seem knowledgeable about AIDS, whichcripples the body's defenses against disease and leaves the victimprey to infections and cancer. It is both incurable and fatal, butcannot be spread casually. It can be passed on by contact withinfected blood or by sexual contact.   Jason doesn't talk often about his disease, or his experience inGranite City, his mother says, although his hurt has spilled over tothe family's new life in South Roxana. Once, hurt, he was crying andasked, ``Doesn't God know I am sick?''   It hasn't been easy for Jason's sister either. Frustrated andconfused, she needed counseling.   Now, Jason feels more at home. His kitchen poster ends with thewords, ``Love may be the hardest thing to get.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Feb. 19</NOTE></DOC>
