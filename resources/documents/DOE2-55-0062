Commercially-marketed seafood sampleswere collected from Boston, Massachusetts, Atlantic City, New Jerseyand San Francisco, California. Each of these cities is near a previously-usedU.S. ocean disposal site for LLW. The data obtained during this monitoringprogram shows that the concentrations of man-made radioactivity in seafoodssampled are below levels of public health concern. The data are consideredto be of normal background level, attributable to global fallout overthe oceans.</TEXT></DOC>
