Meanwhile, President Bush said Mr. Sununu's use of agovernment limousine for a trip to a stamp auction in NewYork last week had created an &quot;appearance problem.&quot; But Mr.Bush, in his most extensive comments so far on Mr. Sununu'scontroversial travel practices, also strongly defended hischief of staff. The president denied he was angry with Mr.Sununu and said his job was safe.</LP><TEXT>   In response to questions about Mr. Sununu's recent shiftto use of corporate jets in the wake of restrictions imposedlast month on his use of government planes, the White Housereleased the list of five jets the chief of staff has usedfor travel to fund-raisers.   The identity of owners of two of the jets already had beenpublicized, and the others are not large nationalcorporations. White House counsel C. Boyden Gray's officeapproved all the travel in advance, and he vetoed somesuggested corporate jets because of potential conflicts ofinterest, White House officials said.   Use of corporate jets for political travel is legalprovided the corporation is reimbursed for providing the rideor reports the travel as an &quot;in-kind&quot; political contribution.Reimbursement for Mr. Sununu's travel often is made by thehost of the political fund-raiser he is attending.   The White House list said that on May 20 Mr. Sununu used acorporate jet provided by Donald Bryant, a benefits andinsurance executive, to travel to a St. Louis fund-raiser forMissouri Gov. John Ashcroft. On June 7, Mr. Sununu used a jetprovided by Fiber Materials Inc. of Biddeford, Maine, totravel to a fund-raiser for the Maine Republican party.   Mr. Sununu used a jet provided by three individual owners-- identified by the White House as Howard Bender, MartinBender and John Mason -- to travel to a Chicago fund-raiserJune 11. The next day, as previously reported, Mr. Sununuused a jet provided by Beneficial Corp., a financialmanagement and planning concern, to return from a fund-raiserfor the New Jersey state party. He had taken his White Houselimousine to reach nearby New York to attend a stamp auctionbefore that event.   And, as also previously disclosed, Mr. Sununu used a jetprovided by KVI, an Iowa insurance brokerage firm, to travelTuesday to a fund-raiser in Des Moines.   Mr. Sununu has resorted to regular use of corporate planesfor political travel in the wake of controversy over hisheavy use of costly government aircraft for political andpersonal travel in the past two years. White House spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater said that use of corporate planes forpolitical purposes is a &quot;well-established practice&quot; that Mr.Sununu will continue.   President Bush rose to the defense of his embattled chiefof staff, while also making clear he is chagrined about thetravel controversy. The president said that Mr. Sununu is&quot;doing a first-class job&quot; and that there is a &quot;piling-onsyndrome&quot; feeding the publicity about his travel.   But Mr. Bush, who spoke to reporters before a White Housemeeting as Mr. Sununu sat nearby, also seemed to suggest thathe would like his chief of staff to avoid creating new travelcontroversies. &quot;I think when you have an appearance problem,I think all of us would agree you want to try to avoid it asmuch as possible, and I think all of us have,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
