The 0.9% increase, adjusted for the 3.6% rise in consumer prices, was the fourth consecutive annual increase in average household after-tax income. Average household income before taxes was $29,070 in 1985, an inflation-adjusted increase of 1.3% from 1984. The bureau said the difference in the before-tax and after-tax figures wasn't statistically significant.    From 1981-1985, after-tax income rose a total of 8.9% after adjustment. The bureau said the increase mainly reflected the rise in average pre-tax income. Furthermore, reductions in federal income taxes offset increases in other types of taxes.    The average after-tax incomes of white and black households in 1985 increased to $23,484 and $15,790 from $23,168 and $15,327, respectively; the average income of Hispanic households remained about unchanged at $17,920. The average after-tax income of married couples with children rose to $28,390 from $27,797, as did the average income of households maintained solely by a female, to $13,093 from $12,679.    The average income of married couples without children was $27,710, which wasn't significantly different from the year before.    The census study also shows that tax payments totaled $569 billion in 1985, or about 22% of the total money income received by all households. The average amount paid was $6,950, $170 more than the average paid in 1984 after adjusting for changes in consumer prices.    Of the total tax payments, 56% went to federal income taxes, 22% for Social Security payroll taxes, 13% for state income taxes and 8% for property taxes.    The study also shows that 65% of the households below the poverty level paid at least one type of tax in 1985. </TEXT></DOC>
