This EIS will be preparedto assess the environmental impacts of a proposed DOE action: to grant(with terms and conditions) or to deny a Presidential permit authorizingBangor Hydro-Electric Company (Bangor Hydro) to construct, connect, operateand maintain at the international border between the United States andCanada new facilities for the transmission of electric energy.Issuance of the Presidential permit by the DOE is one of the necessarysteps leading to the construction of an electric transmission line whichcrosses the U.S. international border. Issuance of the permit indicatesthat there is no Federal objection to the project, but does not mandatethat the project be completed.<T3>Invitation to Comment: </T3>To ensure that the full range of issuesrelated to this proposal are addressed, comments on the proposed scopeand content of the EIS are invited from all interested parties. Writtencomments or suggestions to assist the DOE in identifying significant environmentalissues and the appropriate scope of the EIS should be postmarked by July21, 1989. Comments received after that date will be considered to the extentpracticable. Agencies, organizations, and the general public are also invitedto present oral comments or suggestions pertinent to preparation of thisEIS at the public scoping meetings scheduled as indicated below. Writtenand oral comments will be given equal weight in the scoping process. Commentsand suggestions received during the scoping period will be considered inpreparing the draft EIS. The draft EIS is expected to be completed in 1989,at which time its availability will be announced in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, and public comments will again be solicited.Comments on the draft EIS will be considered in preparing the final EIS.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Written comments or suggestions on the scope of theEIS, requests to speak at the scoping meetings, or questions concerningthe project should be directed to: Anthony J.

This application has been docketed as PP-89.Bangor Hydro's proposed project is scheduled for service by 1991 and wouldconsist of construction of an 80-mile, 345-kilovolt (kV), overhead electrictransmission line which would cross the U.S. Canadian border at Baileyville,Maine, extend approximately 80 miles southwest, and terminate at an existing345/115-kV substation located at Orrington, Maine. The proposed facilitieswould connect at the international border with similar facilities to beconstructed by the New Brunswick Electric Power Commission.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ On February 7, 1989, DOE Delegation Order No. 0204-127was issued transferring the authority to grant Presidential permits fromthe Administrator, Economic Regulatory Administration, to the AssistantSecretary, Fossil Energy.Approximately 12 miles of the line will follow existing rights-of-way,and much of the remainder will require clearing. Bangor Hydro estimatesthat roughly 1500 to 2000 acres of land will have to be cleared. The proposedright-of-way would be 270 feet wide except in areas where only a narrowercorridor can be obtained.The DOE has determined that the issuance of a Presidential permit to BangorHydro for the proposed facilities would constitute a major federal actionsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Consequently,pursuant to the provisions of the NEPA, an EIS will be prepared to assessthe impact of the proposed action on the environment.Interested agencies, organizations, and members of the general public desiringto submit written comments or suggestions for consideration in connectionwith the preparation of this EIS are invited to do so and are encouragedto attend the public scoping meetings which will be held as previouslyidentified.Parties who desire to present oral comments at the scoping meetings shouldprovide advanced notice to the DOE as described below under ``COMMENTSAND SCOPING MEETINGS.'' Upon completion of the draft EIS, its availabilitywill be announced in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>at which time further comments will be solicited.<ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Definition of Environmental Issues</ITAG>The purpose of this notice is to solicit comments and suggestions for considerationin preparation of the EIS. As background for public comment and suggestions,it is useful to list those environmental issues which have been tentativelyidentified for analysis and assessment in the EIS. This list is not intendedto be all inclusive or to imply any predetermination of impacts. Additionalissues for analysis may be identified as a result of public comment.A. Environmental Issues Associated with Transmission Line Construction(1) The loss or modification of upland plant communities due to the permanentremoval of all tall-growing vegetation from proposed rights-of-way, andof all vegetation from tower footings, access roads substation sites;(2) Minor relocations and alterations to other existing facilities alongproposed rights-of-way;(3) Temporary disruption of wildlife communities, agricultural productionand other land uses along the line route during actual construction;(4) Potential long-term effects on wildlife communities from loss and modificationof habitat;(5) Temporary interference with aquatic life during construction at streamand river crossings;(6) Potential long-term effects to aquatic resources from erosion and sedimentationand clearing of riparian vegetation;(7) Temporary socioeconomic perturbations due to the influx of constructionworkers into sparsely populated areas;(8) Temporary noise and air pollution resulting from operation of constructionequipment and from burning of slash from clearing of rights-of-way;(9) Disruption and displacement of soils during activities associated withland clearing; and(10) Potential contamination of groundwater.B. Environmental Issues Associated with Transmission Line Operation andMaintenance(1) Long-term withdrawal of traditional land use (e.g., forest, agriculture,residential) within rights-of-way and land required for other project facilities;(2) Periodic interference with plant and wildlife communities along rights-of-waydue to required maintenance activities, particularly vegetation control;(3) Generation of acoustic noise and electromagnetic interference withradio and television reception along rights-of-way;(5) Possible health effects from periodic and/or prolonged exposure toelectric and magnetic fields produced by alternating current transmission;(6) Possible long-term effects on public health and aquatic and terrestrialorganisms due to the use of herbicides for vegetation control along rights-of-way;(7) Indirect ecological and socioeconomic effects resulting from easierunauthorized human access to some areas via access roads and rights-of-way,such as increased hunting or use by motorcycles or snowmobiles; and(8) Long-term visual impacts resulting from the presence of support towers,conductors, and other project facilities.C. Other Specific Environmental Issues(1) The possibility of affecting threatened or endangered species or criticalhabitats for such species;(2) Identification and review of alternatives to construction within a100-year floodplain or identified wetlands and identification and reviewof mitigating measures to be taken if it is found that there are no practicablealternatives to construction in a floodplain or wetland;(3) Possible direct and adverse effects on the values for which a wild,scenic or recreational river was established;(4) Environmental factors relevant to any proposed construction in or overnavigable rivers, or to any proposed actions resulting in the dischargeof dredge or fill materials into any waters of the U.S.; and(5) Actions having an impact on the continued use and viability of primeand unique farmlands.<ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Definition of Alternatives</ITAG>One of the major purposes of an EIS is to define the reasonable alternativesto the proposed action and the environmental impacts to be expected fromeach reasonable alternative. As background for public comments and suggestionsconcerning reasonable alternatives to be considered, the broad classesof alternatives which have been tentatively identified are described brieflybelow.``Alternatives to the Transmission Line Should the Presidential PermitBe Denied'' addresses those alternatives to the proposal which attemptto achieve the stated benefits of the proposed line if the DOE denies thepermit. ``Design Alternatives to the Proposed Action'' addresses design,routing and other variations to the line as proposed should the DOE grantthe permit with such conditions.A. Alternatives to the Transmission Line Should the Presidential PermitBe DeniedIf the DOE does not grant the permit, alternatives to the proposal availableto Bangor Hydro to achieve the stated benefit of the project include:(1) Installing larger size conductors on existing transmission lines toincrease transfer capability and reduce electrical losses;(2) Development and construction of new, non-conventional types of generatingplants (e.g., solar or wind) closer to load centers to reduce the needfor construction of conventional generating plants and to reduce electricaltransmission losses;(3)Load management by energy storage or conservation and/or replacementof some end uses of electricity by other sources of energy, which wouldreduce seasonal variations in load and total annual electrical energy requirements;(4) Purchases of power from utilities within the United States; and(5) Development of cogeneration and distributed small power projects throughoutthe state.B. Design Alternatives to the Proposed Transmission LineThe environmental impacts which would result from construction and operationof the proposed project would depend on the choice among a number of alternativepossibilities as to where, when and how the project was constructed, aswell as the choice of alternative maintenance and repair procedures duringoperation. The DOE could grant the Presidential permit subject to conditionscontrolling these variables. Such conditions would be identified in theEIS. Tentatively identified groups of alternatives for consideration inthe EIS include: (a) Design, (b) route selection, (c) construction practicesand (seasonal) timing, (d) rights-of-way clearing procedures, and (e) rights-of-waymaintenance practices.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Scoping Meetings</ITAG>The purpose of the scoping meetings is to obtain information from interestedparties on the issues which should be addressed when preparing the EIS.These meetings will be conducted informally; however, a transcript of themeetings will be prepared. Parties who desire to present oral commentsat a meeting should provide advanced notice to the DOE by June 6, 1989,if possible. The DOE has designated Ms. Constance L. Buckley, Deputy Directorof DOE's Office of Fuels Programs, as presiding officer at these meetings.The presiding officer will establish the order of speakers and provideany additional procedures necessary for the conduct of the meetings.Speakers will be allotted approximately 10 minutes for their oral statement.Should any speaker desire to provide for the record further informationwhich cannot be presented within the designated time, such additional informatinmay be submitted in writing by July 21, 1989. Written comments will beconsidered and given equal weight with oral comments. Meetings will commenceat the times specified above and will continue until those present whowish to speak have had an opportunity to do so.A transcript of the scoping meetings will be retained by the DOE and, uponrequest, made available for inspection and copying at the Freedom of InformationLibrary, Room 1E-090, Forrestal Bldg., 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington,DC 20585, between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday throughFriday.<ITAG tagnum="84">Draft EIS Schedule and Availability</ITAG>The draft EIS is scheduled for completion by December 1989, at which timeits availability will be announced in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and public comments again will be solicited.Those individuals who do not wish to submit comments or suggestions atthis time but who would like to receive a copy of the draft EIS for reviewand comment when it is issued should notify Mr. Anthony J. Como at theaddress given in the prior section.One of the requirements placed on the applicant for a Presidential permitis the submission of an Environmental Report. This report is scheduledfor completion by July 1989. This and other documents to be used in thepreparation of the draft EIS will be made available for public inspectionat several public libraries or reading rooms in Maine. A notice of theselocations will be provided in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> at a later date.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC on May 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Peter N.
