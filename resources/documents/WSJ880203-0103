The interested acquirer, Atlantic Richfield Co., distinctly American.    Not since the Los Angeles-based oil company made an offbeat purchase of the London Observer newspaper in 1976 has Arco stirred such interest in the United Kingdom. (Arco sold the paper in 1981.) But this time the company's pursuit of things British is less whimsical and prospectively more profitable than its foray into publishing.    The unsuccessful bid for as much as 49.9% of Glasgow, Scotland-based Britoil and a more-recent accumulation of a 14.8% stake in London-based Tricentrol, another oil company, are part of a plan to treble Arco's foreign oil and natural-gas reserves, overturning the company's longstanding preoccupation with domestic oil and gas operations.    Lodwrick M. Cook, Arco's chairman and chief executive officer, says the overseas interest is &quot;the one piece of unfinished business&quot; among a series of strategic changes that in recent years have seen the nation's seventh-largest oil company halve its work force, take more than $1.5 billion in writedowns, lop $700 million from its yearly expenses and buy one-fifth of its stock.    The wrenching restructuring already has made Arco one of the nation's most profitable oil companies -- and one of a very few to report per-share earnings that actually surpass the profits reported in the halcyon days of $30-a-barrel oil. The 1987 record per-share profit of $6.68, or $1.22 billion, was earned on revenue of $16.83 billion.    If Arco's foreign thrust succeeds, it will further boost the company's profitability, better its chances of finding giant oil fields and align it more closely with the structure of other major oil companies.    For many years, Arco's stake in the giant Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska made an overseas search for oil unnecessary. &quot;In the 1970's and early '80's, we were putting so much money into Alaska that we didn't have the time, the money, or the resources to do more overseas,&quot; recalls Mr. Cook.    But Prudhoe Bay oil production is expected to peak shortly. And Arco's foreign reserves today are just shy of 10% of the company total -- compared with other major oil companies that average about a third of their oil and gas reserves outside the U.S. &quot;Arco is by far and away the most domestically oriented of all the major U.S. oil companies,&quot; says Frederick P. Leuffer, an industry analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc., a New York-based securities company.    Arco plans to boost its percentage of foreign reserves to about the industry average. That will take time, Mr. Cook cautions. &quot;We don't have any particular timetable in mind.&quot;    But Arco's British campaigns suggest a willingness to move sooner rather than later. &quot;The most efficient, low-risk approach is to buy operations,&quot; says Eugene L. Nowak, an industry analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., New York.    Arco's proposed purchase of nearly half of Britoil would have more than trebled in a single step Arco's proven petroleum reserves in the U.K. The acquisition was thrown off track two weeks ago, when a determined British Petroleum Co. sweetened a hostile bid for the 70.1% of Britoil it didn't own to a total of #1.77 billion ($3.11 billion). Arco, which last Friday tendered its 24.03% Britoil stake to BP, rounded up a tidy profit of about #134 million before taxes and expenses.    With its profit wrapped up, Arco has bought a 14.8% stake in Tricentrol, a much smaller company with gas-rich North Sea reserves that would nevertheless boost Arco's proven reserves in the U.K. by about 50%.    Arco is widely expected to make a bid for all or part of Tricentrol, topping a #148.6 million bid by Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, a French state-controlled energy company. Mr. Cook declines to comment on any matters pertaining to Tricentrol or Britoil.    Foreign reserves are attractive because they often cost less to find, for reasons including the price of land, labor costs and the possibility of bigger discoveries abroad. In the five years through 1986, major oil companies spent an average of $8.40 to discover a barrel of oil outside the U.S. -- 21% less than the $10.69 it cost to find a barrel of domestic reserves.    As well, many oil men believe that foreign oil acreage offers greater prospects of finding so-called elephants -- the big discoveries of a billion barrels or more that the major companies need to replace depleting reserves.    &quot;The big finds are clearly going to be made overseas,&quot; predicts Mike R. Bowlin, the fast-rising, 44-year-old executive who recently was appointed to head Arco's international oil and gas operations.    Arco has operated in Indonesia for some years and has had relatively small holdings in the North Sea. &quot;Both countries are good places to be these days,&quot; says Thomas A. Petrie, a Denver-based analyst with First Boston. However, it appears that Arco may want to offset its Indonesian operations with increased reserves in the politically more secure North Sea.    The company also has expanded operations in other parts of the globe. It is in the process of negotiating new drilling rights in Ghana and Gabon. It is considering buying its way into exploration now under way in central Africa. Acreage has been acquired in Egypt, and drilling began recently in Turkey.    In all, Arco expects to participate in about 55 overseas exploration wells in 1988, up from 34 in 1987.    Arco can afford to increase exploration both inside and outside the U.S. Its restructuring has assured the company a healthy cash flow -- even at relatively low oil prices. Analysts estimate that Arco's flow of funds exceeded $3 billion in 1987, up from $1.3 billion from continuing operations a year earlier.    While long-term debt remains hefty after the restructuring, at about $6.7 billion, the company has amassed more than $3.5 billion in cash and securities, up from $2.4 billion at the end of 1986.    Such a trove could attract unwanted suitors for Arco. But Mr. Cook professes that he's not worried. &quot;I don't lose any sleep over it,&quot; he says, adding, &quot;It would be terribly expensive if someone did it.&quot; Indeed, at current prices, the company has a total market value of about $13.5 billion.    Meanwhile, the prospect of making acquisitions of its own after years of shrinking seems to have brought a new levity to Arco's executive floors. A senior executive, peeking in on Mr. Cook and Mr. Bowlin at a private meal a few days ago, joshed a bit about Mr. Bowlin's profitable sale of Britoil stock to BP. &quot;I see you're havin' lunch with Boone Pickens,&quot; the executive said to laughter from the chairman and Mr. Bowlin. </TEXT></DOC>
