The investigation found that there had beena substantial improvement in U.S. energy security since the last section232 petroleum finding in 1979. However, declining domestic oil production,rising oil imports and growing Free World dependence on potentially insecuresources of supply raise a number of concerns, including vulnerability toa major supply disruption. Given the importance of oil to our economicsecurity, foreign policy flexibility, and defense preparedness, the Secretaryfound that imports of petroleum threaten to impair the national security.However, taking into account the Reagan Administration's detailed programto improve energy security transmitted to Congress on May 6, 1987, theSecretary recommended that no action, such as an oil import fee, be takento adjust imports under section 232. It was determined that such actionwould not be cost effective and, in the long run, would impair rather thanenhance national security. On January 3, 1989, President Reagan approvedSecretary Verity's finding and determined that no action to adjust oilimports under Section 232 need be taken.

The petition did not suggesta specific remedy, but requested that the Department of Commerce (DOC)``recommend appropriate remedial action to the President.'' On December 23, 1987, the Department of Commerce accepted the petition,initiated an investigation and invited public comment. (Extensive commentsreflecting support for and opposition to the allegations made by the petitionwere received from oil producers, refiners, consumers, public officials,and foreign governments.)Under then-existing law, DOC had one year, until December 1, 1988, in whichto complete its investigation and forward its report with recommendationsto the President. (Since that time, Congress has amended the statute torequire future reports to be completed within 270 days.) In conductingthe investigation, the Department made use of the extensive data and analysisthat were already available regarding the current and prospective statusof the domestic petroleum industry and the world oil market as well asthe extensive recent national security analyses of oil supply and demandunder crisis conditions.MethodologyThe investigation used a three step process to evaluate the effect of petroleumimports on the national security. The methodology for this investigationwas to: (1) Review previous energy security assessments and resulting initiatives;(2) review current world oil market and status of U.S. petroleum producingand refining industries to develop a current U.S. energy security assessment;and (3) perform a national security review.AnalysisThe investigation commenced with a review of previous analyses of the effectof oil imports on the domestic petroleum industry and on United Statesenergy security. These included national security investigations conductedin 1975 and in 1979 under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962,as well as the 1959 investigation under section 8(d) of the Trade AgreementsExtension Act of 1958. DOC also reviewed the analyses and findings of twomajor studies done by the Department of Energy (DOE)_``Product Imports,Energy Security and the Domestic Refining Industry'' (1986) and ``EnergySecurity: A Report To The President of the United States,'' (1987) andother studies done by the Administration since 1981. This review highlightedthe focus of several Administrations regarding this issue.The investigation presented an analysis of the current and prospectivestatus of U.S. energy security in light of recent developments in the worldoil market. This analysis highlighted a number of key trends and factorswhich will have a significant effect on U.S. energy security in the future.Since 1979, U.S. energy security has been strengthened and the United Statesis better prepared than before to deter as well as respond to an energysupply emergency. The following factors have served to enhance U.S. energysecurity since the late 1970's: andbullet; U.S. petroleum imports have declined by over 2 million barrelsper day (MMB/D) from 1979 to 1987 or 27 percent. The U.S. Strategic PetroleumReserve (SPR) now contains over 555 million barrels, whereas in 1979, only91 million barrels were stored. Other OECD countries' government-ownedemergency oil stocks now amount to 400 million barrels and coordinatedenergy emergency sharing programs have been developed and tested regularly.In addition, many private companies have stocks in excess of commercialneeds. Some of these stocks are potentially available for use in an emergencysituation. Non-OPEC oil production now accounts for 60 percent of FreeWorld oil production, approximately 9-10 MMB/D of surplus oil productioncapacity exists in the market. Natural gas supplies use has been expandedin non-OPEC countries. The construction of additional crude oil pipelineshas diversified Middle East oil transportation patterns and thus has reducedthe share of Persian Gulf production delivered to world markets throughthe Straits of Hormuz. andbullet; There have also been important developments in conservation andinterfuel substitution that contribute to enhancing U.S. energy security.The United States consumed only as much energy in 1987 as it did in 1973,even though the economy grew 40 percent over that period. At the same time,many large oil users such as industrial firms and utilities have developedthe capability to substitute large volumes of natural gas or coal for importedoil when economic conditions or other factors dictate. andbullet; Since the late 1970's, there has been a shift in the sources andlevels of U.S. oil import dependence. Sources outside of the Middle Eastnow account for a larger share of U.S. oil imports. During 1987, Canada,Mexico, and the United Kingdom supplied 31 percent of net petroleum importsas compared to 15 percent in 1979. andbullet; Although many small U.S. refineries have closed between 1981 and1986, current U.S. refining capacity (15-16 million B/D) combined withimports from reliable Free World sources is sufficient to meet demand.The principal cause for the closure of 120 U.S. refineries during thistime was the elimination of both crude oil price controls and the SmallRefiner Bias Provision of the Entitlements Program. The Department's investigation also identified a number of other factorsaffecting future U.S. energy security: andbullet; Various U.S. Government energy reports have concluded that bythe mid-1990's and beyond, we may be importing about half or more of ouroil consumption. To the extent the United States and other countries importmore oil in the future, it is projected they will turn increasingly toOPEC countries_particularly those located in the Persian Gulf region whichhave the largest amounts of surplus oil production capacity and reserves.Dependence on a small number of suppliers located largely in a volatileregion could make the United States and the OECD countries increasinglyvulnerable to oil supply disruptions or cartel manipulation of productionand price. andbullet; U.S. petroleum imports are likely to increase in the years aheadbecause domestic reserves of economically recoverable oil are declining.Further, as world crude oil prices have declined since 1986, the relativelysmaller U.S. oil fields with higher cost U.S. production became uneconomicand some wells were shut-in or abandoned. andbullet; The level of domestic drilling activity remains low, and the lowprices have had an adverse effect on the U.S. petroleum services industries.andbullet; The most promising currently known prospects for major new oilfields in the United States are in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) andin the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Exploration and eventualproduction from these areas could help offset anticipated production declinesin other parts of the United States, thereby helping to limit the growthin U.S. dependence on foreign oil supplies. However, the long lead timesneeded from exploration to production mean that it could still be a decadebefore oil is extracted, even if access were granted within the next yearor so.andbullet; Though not currently a problem, in the event of a large priceor volume increases, rising outlays for imported oil would increase theneed for expansion of exports or decreases in other imports. However, ifpriced below the cost of domestic supplies, expanding oil imports wouldenhance domestic economic efficiency and continue contributing to the internationalcompetitiveness of U.S. firms. andbullet; On the other hand, lower priced oil has had a beneficial effecton U.S. international competitiveness and economic growth thereby contributingto one of the longest sustained post-war economic recoveries.In addition, national defense petroleum mobilization requirements wereevaluated in light of previous national security studies and a review ofthe current world oil market. It was determined that the United Stateswould be able to meet defense requirements and essential industrial andcivilian needs in a major conventional war from domestic energy production,the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and reliable petroleum imports. It wasalso determined that we have sufficient refining capacity to process thisoil.In the event of a three year, large scale conventional conflict coupledwith a substantial decrease in oil supplies, defense needs would receivepriority. Consequently, domestic dislocations resulting from decreasedpetroleum availability could be significant and have a significant deleteriouseffect upon the U.S. economy. Further, growing Free World dependence onpotentially insecure sources of oil can constrain foreign policy flexibilityand U.S. military power projection capabilities even in peacetime.FindingThere have been substantial improvements in U.S. energy security sincethe last section 232 Petroleum finding in 1979. However, declining domesticoil production, rising oil imports, and growing Free World dependence onpotentially insecure sources of supply raise a number of concerns, includingvulnerability to a major supply disruption. The investigation found thatthe maintenance of U.S. access to sufficient supplies of petroleum is essentialto our economic security, foreign policy flexibility, and defense preparedness.Given the above factors, it was found that petroleum imports threaten toimpair the national security.U.S. Government Energy Actions Which Enhanced National SecuritySince 1981, the Administration has implemented policies that have substantiallyincreased U.S. energy and national security. Major actions include: (1)Fully decontrolling oil prices in 1981 and eliminating allocation controls;and (2) filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to 555 million barrelsand committing to a 750 million barrel reserve. Other actions to enhanceenergy security and maintain a strong domestic oil industry include: andbullet; Reestablishing the five-year Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leasingprogram and reducing the minimum bid for certain offshore leases. andbullet; Increasing Federal spending for clean coal to $2.5 billion overthe next five years and reestablishing a Federal coal leasing program.andbullet; Preserving the intangible drilling costs treatment in the TaxReform Act of 1986 and retaining the full-cost accounting provisions. andbullet; Encouraging our allies and friends to build up their government-ownedstrategic stockpiles, which amount to about 400 million barrels (mostlyin Germany and Japan), and to coordinate stock drawdowns during an emergency.andbullet; Developing with our partners in the International Energy Agencypolicies and programs, including stock drawdown measures, for coordinatedinternational responses to future oil supply disruption. andbullet; Obtaining Congressional repeal of the Windfall Profits Tax whichremoves major disincentives for producers to develop further existing oilreserves, explore for new reserves, and reduce the paperwork burden onthe industry. andbullet; The implementation of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement whichwill promote increased bilateral energy trade and provide reliable suppliesat competitive prices. RecommendationsWhile U.S. energy security has improved since the 1970's, a threat to U.S.national security cannot be ignored and future projected trends requirevigilance. Although no single program or specific action could eliminateU.S. dependence on some insecure petroleum imports, there are a numberof cost-effective actions that could reduce our vulnerability and increaseour flexibility.The best means to enhance U.S. energy security is to increase opportunitiesfor economic domestic energy production and toensure that adequate oilsupplies are available in the event of a supply disruption. The Congressand the States should continue to be urged to take immediate steps to implementthe President's program. Specifically: andbullet; <T3>Enacting Comprehensive Natural Gas Reform_</T3>this action would helpgas to reach its full potential in substituting for imported oil; andbullet; <T3>Permitting Environmentally Sound Oil Exploration and Development ofthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Coastal Plain in Alaska and of theOuter Continental Shelf_</T3>these are the most promising prospects fordiscovering major new oil reserves in the United States. Exploration andproduction from these areas would serve to limit our growing dependenceon foreign oil; andbullet; <T3>Ensuring the Viability of Nuclear Power Through Licensing Reform_</T3>Thiswould involve the issuance of a combined license for both constructionand operation of a nuclear power plant. This action would provide a vehicleso that utility, public, State, and Federal concerns could be resolvedbefore plant construction, thereby reducing project costs;andbullet; <T3>Removing Tax Disincentives To Domestic Oil Exploration and Developmentand Reducing Early Well Abandonment_</T3>These consist of: (1) Increasingthe net income limitation on the percentage depletion allowance from 50to 100 percent per property; and (2) repealing the transfer rule to permituse of percentage depletion for proven properties that have changed hands;andbullet; <T3>Filling the SPR to 750 Million Barrels_</T3>The Naval Petroleum Reservesat Elk Hills, California, and Teapot Dome, Wyoming, should be sold in orderto finance an increased fill rate for the SPR, which is a more effectiveemergency reserve, and to pay for a new 10 million barrel Defense PetroleumInventory;An action to adjust imports by way of quotas, fees or tariffs, under theauthority of section 232, is not recommended because such actions are notcost beneficial and, in the long run, impair rather than enhance nationalsecurity. Section 232 states that ``In the administration of this section,the Secretary and President shall further recognize the close relationof the economic welfare of the Nation to our national security * * * .''An oil import fee and/or quantitative import restrictions would raise theprice of oil resulting in only a small temporary increase in U.S. production,while causing substantial increased economic costs and adverse competitiveimpacts throughout the U.S. economy. In addition, the beneficial effectthat the President's initiatives should have on U.S. energy security arguesagainst taking formal action to adjust imports under section 232.The DOE<T3> Energy Security</T3> report of 1987 examined oil import fees in detail.The report found that oil import fees have overall economic costs far inexcess of their benefits. Specifically, the study concluded that a $10per barrel fixed import fee could increase domestic production (about 400thousand B/D) and discourage consumption, leading to a reduction of importsof about 1.5 million B/D.However, a $10 per barrel import fee would have greater negative effectson the overall economy (<T3>e.g.,</T3> stimulating inflation, decreasing the competitiveness ofoil consuming industries, reducing the GNP). Consumers would pay higherprices for oil and this would inflate costs throughout the economy. Thus,the economy would incur substantial adjustment costs. The Department ofEnergy has estimated that the economy would suffer a loss in output of$150-200 billion over the 1988-1995 period as a result of a $10 per barrelfee. This output loss would exceed the estimated benefits accruing fromthe fee. The DOE<T3> Energy Security</T3> report also analyzed the impact of a $5 per barrelfee on the economy. DOE estimates that the $5 fee would result in an additional200,000 b/d of domestic oil production by 1995. However the $5 fee wouldalso have the same negative effects on the economy as the $10 fee, albeiton a smaller scale. On balance, the costs of $5 fee outweigh the benefitsto the petroleum sector. Additionally, other methods for affecting imports,such as volumetric quotas, would have similar economic and competitivenessimpacts.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-3311 Filed 2-10-89; 8:45am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3510-DT-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
