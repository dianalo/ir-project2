Only a few will be called back for a full-scale trial.    &quot;I hope we're on the list,&quot; says an anxious Peter Boer, head of research at W.R. Grace andamp; Co. Otherwise, he says, the company is going to &quot;lose position to the competition.&quot;    Pending clean-air legislation has sparked both a heated contest to develop technologies for curbing acid rain and intense investor interest in the contenders. But a sound technology alone may not guarantee a piece of the estimated $3.5 billion-a-year market for controlling acid rain. Engineering companies need to find utilities willing to test their science, or be left at a disadvantage. &quot;It's impractical to set up a pilot plant from scratch, so you have to work with someone's site,&quot; says Mr. Boer.    A technology is &quot;in the club&quot; only after a utility tests it, says Paul Knight, an analyst at Washington Analysis Corp., a research concern. &quot;There are at least a hundred technologies out there, and more will emerge, but only a few will get the stamp of legitimacy.&quot;    Since the 1977 Clean Air Act, only a handful of engineering companies have entered the club with their &quot;scrubber&quot; technologies, which chemically extract pollutants from flue gases. The newer technologies include improved versions of some old approaches, such as &quot;coal washing,&quot; and installation of huge towers and chambers packed with sophisticated catalysts to catch the byproducts of coal burning -- sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides -- which fall to earth as acid rain.    Coal-producing communities, especially in the Appalachian region, have a large stake in these technologies, too. Coal-burning utilities generate 60% of the nation's sulfur dioxide emissions. Without new solutions to the problem, power plants will likely be forced to seek more expensive, low-sulfur coal, which is usually found in the East.    The impetus for these new technologies is coming from clean-air bills pending in Congress and the high priority the Bush administration has given in its own proposed amendments to the current Clean Air Act.    How extensively the utilities will have to retrofit their plants will depend upon the final legislation expected by next year. Even the least stringent administration bill would require a company like Southern Co. to retrofit at least half its plants with one or the other new technologies and switch to low-sulfur coals in the others. &quot;That will mean at least a billion dollars increase in annual costs, or an 8% rate increase for customers,&quot; says Charles Goodman, vice president of research at Atlanta-based Southern Co.    One of the reasons the utilities must find alternatives to the relatively new scrubber technology, even though it's quite effective, is that the byproducts of scrubber methods will be suspect under the new pollution regulations. The scrubbers, which account for a quarter of the size of a power plant, use a fine spray of lime or limestone to extract sulfur dioxide from the flue emissions, and produce huge amounts of sludge. A storage problem also arises with the tons of limestone that the process requires.    One old technology that has been refined into a leading contender for commercial application is coal washing. An advanced process, developed by a McDermott International unit and Asea Brown Boveri of Sweden, involves crushing coal into fine powder and then &quot;washing&quot; it during combustion with calcium-based absorbents to soak up sulfur dioxide.    American Electric Power Service Corp. is building a small plant in Brilliant, Ohio, to test the process. In this technology, coal is kept churning under high pressure during combustion. Michael J. Mudd, principal engineer at the utility, says that in such a condition coal requires only half as much heat to burn as in conventional boilers, and so produces only half as much nitrogen oxide.    A major drawback of these methods is that additional technologies are required to completely remove nitrogen oxides. Some technologies attempt to simultaneously remove both gases with catalysts, the same way catalytic converters render automobile emissions harmless. Noxso Corp., a new company founded to develop one such technology, is designing a pilot plant at a site of an Ohio utility.    The Noxso process involves passing flue gases through a bed of alumina beads coated with sodium. The beads, stored in tanks 40 feet high and 40 feet in diameter, absorb both gases. The beads are then drained from the tanks in a continuous process, heated with natural gas and treated with steam. As the final product, the process yields elemental sulfur, a basic chemical commodity widely used to make sulfuric acid.    The nitrogen oxides released by the beads are recycled back into the coal boilers, triggering a &quot;reversible&quot; chemical reaction in which nitrogen oxides are produced and reduced in the same amounts, at the same time. &quot;The net is zero emission,&quot; says L.G. Neal, president of Noxso.    W.R. Grace, which has agreed with Noxso to jointly develop the process, also has a technology of its own -- the one it's trying to market to Southern and other utilities. It involves first mixing flue gases with ammonia and sending the mixture through a large catalytic converter, a honeycomb ceramic made of metal oxides. The catalyst helps the ammonia react with nitrogen oxides to form harmless nitrogen and water.    But cost is a big problem with these catalysts. &quot;They have to be replaced every year,&quot; says Southern's Mr. Goodman.    On the fringes of these developments is RCM Technologies Inc., a Los Angeles engineering concern. In a rundown industrial section of Camden, N.J., it has rigged up a demonstration plant. The pilot plant appears to burn high-sulfur coal in a boiler and to send the dark fumes through looping pipes and chambers to a chimney that, according to RCM's chairman, Robert Sackett, doesn't emit any noxious gases.    RCM assiduously courts the media but declines to give details of its process. Mr. Sackett claims that some utilities have looked at the demonstration plant, but he declines to disclose the names. Mr. Knight, the analyst, has looked at the RCM demonstration and says the technology &quot;looks and sounds good.&quot; But, he adds, unless a utility checks it out at a power plant &quot;you don't know.&quot;    The Electric Power Research Institute, a utilities trade group, is itself evaluating technologies, singling out ones that should get its stamp of approval. Edward Cichanowicz, manager for air-quality control, says the group has identified 65 potential processes, using 40 different criteria. He says eight of the technologies will be targeted for further development in co-operation with utilities.    &quot;Environmental controls cannot be evaluated solely according to reduction in airborne emissions,&quot; says Mr. Cichanowicz. &quot;They must also produce byproduct liquids and solids that can be safely managed, or preferably sold as a resource.&quot;    ---@ Cost Estimates for Clean Air Technologies @ (In millions, for 500-megawatt plant) @ ANNUAL @ CAPITAL OPERATING @ COST COST @ Catalytic reduction* $125 $20 @ Scrubbers $100-$150 $15 @ Clean-coal $100-$150 $ 5 @ Low-sulfur coal $ 30-$ 50 $15-$25 @ *NOXSO technology @ Source: Washington Analysis Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
