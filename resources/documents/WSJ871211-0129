House Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.) and House telecommunications subcommittee chairman Edward Markey (D., Mass.) said the FCC proposal &quot;would expose telephone customers to marketplace abuse by sanctioning telephone prices that are higher than economic costs.&quot; Their comments were contained in a letter to FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick, whose highest priority is to end traditional telephone regulation.    Many industry analysts have considered the FCC proposal a shoe-in, and have cited it in justifying bullish predictions for ATandamp;T's future profits.    As previously reported, the FCC in August asked for comment on a proposal that would effectively freeze the prices ATandamp;T charges for interstate long-distance services. These so-called price caps then could be adjusted annually to reflect changes in inflation, productivity and other costs. Critics contend such price caps would keep rates higher than costs would dictate; Mr. Patrick has said it would give ATandamp;T the incentive to cut costs and pass along some of the savings to consumers.    Currently, the FCC regulates ATandamp;T's profit margin; any cost savings that push profits above the allowed limit must be returned to ratepayers. Under the FCC's plan, the price caps would take the place of any regulation of profit margins.    But the opposition by Reps. Dingell and Markey underscore that the FCC proposal faces an uncertain future. At a hearing last month of Rep. Markey's committee, both Republican and Democratic members expressed deep skepticism that the plan would benefit consumers. Ultimately, any FCC proposal could be checked by legislation.    Mr. Patrick, who probably will remain in office for a little more than a year, also faces severe time constraints. The issues involved in telephone regulation are enormously complex, and a different chairman may choose a different approach. </TEXT></DOC>
