(ARC), anindependent consulting company based in Medfield, Mass.andM;ARC found that costs for labor, which ranges from creating softwareapplications to writing the interfaces and drivers for various hardwareplatforms, currently account for 35 percent of the cost of an integrated CIMimplementation.andP;  Hardware accounts for the rest of that expense, which mayrange from as low as $50,000 for a small PC-based project, to amulti-million-dollar investment.andP;  Within the next three to five years, ARCprojects that labor costs will rise to 50 percent of total system costs, duelargely to a continuing drop in hardware prices.andP;  (See &quot;Where money for CIMsystems goes,&quot; page 33.)andM;Determining the return on an investment in even a simple CIM implementationcan be tricky.andM;Most attempts to justify CIM projects have centered around reducing laborcosts.andP;  Unfortunately, this is a red herring.andP;  Manpower savings are perhapsthe last place companies should look for CIM benefits.andP;  According to ARC,only 10 percent of manufacturing cost results from labor.andP;  Overhead accountsfor 35 percent of the cost, and materials and energy consumption amount to 55percent.andM;Thus, reducing materials usage or improving yield rates is a more effectiveway to justify a CIM system.andP;  (See &quot;Where to look for CIM savings,&quot; page 37.)andO;Most estimates of factory-floor waste range between 20 percent and 25 percentof manufacturing cost.andP;  Materials and energy account for more than half ofthe cost of production, therefore this approach provides considerable fiscalleverage for CIM cost justification.andM;By adding statistical analysis packages that permit on-line monitoring andadjustment of manufacturing processes, some companies have reduced waste byas much as 65 percent and, in some cases, eliminated rework costs.andM;Manufacturing waste stems from both random and systematic errors, both ofwhich may be reduced by a CIM system.andP;  In continuous-process applications,CIM can also be particularly effective because it can eliminateoverproduction errors that arise, for example, when moe ingredients are addedto a process to correct a measuring error.andM;Energy savings are also provided by a CIM system that reduces excess demandby executing real-time load control.andP;  A CIM system can control energy use inmotors, pumps, compressors and other devices that require a lot of energy,tailoring energy demands to a desired, cost-effective profile.andP;  Overall, anautomated energy management system can reduce steam and electricity use by 10percent to 20 percent, according to ARC.andM;Although smaller-scale CIM projects are the best investment today, even theseinvestments must be made with an eye toward the inevitable integration withother systems throughout the company.andP;  Seventy percent to 80 percent of thelifetime costs of a CIM system are fixed at the time of purchase, and thesecosts may be as much as six or seven times the initial purchase cost of theCIM system.andM;The lifetime costs of a system include system expansions, training, parts andmaintenance.andM;Several studies indicate, not surprisingly, that plantwide andorganizationwide systems are cheaper if they are homogeneous.andP;  Developinginterfaces and expanding homogeneous systems is less difficult, and thereforeless costly.andP;  However, this trend directly counters what is happening in manyother parts of an organization, where heterogeneous MIS platforms have becomethe order of the day.andM;According to a study conducted last year by Advanced Manufacturing Research(AMR), a consulting company in Cambridge, Mass., DECnet holds the pre-eminentposition in plantwide networks, representing close to 50 percent of theinstallations surveyed, while TCP/IP takes second place as the protocol stackof choice.andM;At the same time, 80 percent of the companies surveyed said that Open SystemsInterconnect (OSI) plays an important role in their networking plans for thefuture, mostly through upgrades to DECnet Phase V.andP;  This percentage indicatesa stronger trend toward OSI standardization in the manufacturing arena thanin other business segments, which often still rely on IBM's Systems NetworkArchitecture or, increasingly, PC networks.andM;But standardized networking and system homogeneity are not the only keys to asuccessful long-term CIM strategy.andP;  To make the most effective CIMinvestments, companies would be well-advised to alter some of theiraccounting methods to gain a better understanding of both the costs andbenefits of CIM.andM;Computer Aided Manufacturing-International (CAM-I), a research anddevelopment consortium in Arlington, Texas, recommends that companies dividesingle-plant cost centers into several smaller centers.andP;  CAM-I suggests thesesmaller cost centers should be based on what it calls &quot;group technology,&quot;where a process includes a cell with related equipment that can be thought ofas a single, complex machine.andP;  The costs and the benefits can thus bedirectly measured.andM;In developing a cost-justification for CIM, manufacturers should alsoquantify the benefits CIM may provide in flexibility, customer service andspace reductions, as well as adjust hurdle rates so that the long-termadvantages of CIM may be recognized in the cost-justification process.andM;Another area that cannot be overlooked, according to CAM-I, is manufacturinglead time.andM;Lead time includes manufacturing steps such as inspection time, move time andwait time, processes that add nothing to the value of the product, yet costthe company money.andP;  By applying CIM--via such methods as just-in-timeinventory, or quality-control measures--a company can reduce its lead timeand thus lower its attendant costs.andM;CAM-I suggets two measures of lead time.andP;  The first, called theManufacturing-Cycle Efficiency (MCE) ratio, is derived by dividing theprocessing time by the sum of the processing time and the wait time, movetime and other steps that add no value.andP;  (See &quot;How to CalculateManufacturing-Cycle Efficiency,&quot; right.)andP;  The perfect manufacturing processwould have an MCE of 1.andM;Another way to measure the efficacy of reduced manufacturing lead time is tocalculate the cost of work in progress (WIP) and measure gains as a result ofreductions in WIP costs.andM;For example, if a product costs $100 to produce, if it has a lead time of 30days, and if 100 units are produced beginning on the first day of each month,then the product's WIP inventory value would be calculated as 100 units timesthe cost of $10 per unit, or $10,000.andP;  But if lead time were reduced by 50percent, to 15 days, the WIP inventory value would also be reduced by 50percent; it would average $10,000 for the first 15 days and nothing for theremainder of the month.andM;Therefore, the benefits of introducing a CIM system that reducesmanufacturing lead time can be measured by looking at the reduction in WIPcosts.andM;Reduction in non-value-added process costs and reductions in energy,materials and reworking costs all add up to effective quality control.andP;  Thethrust today on the part of CIM suppliers, including DEC, is toward totalquality control (TQC), the integration of these different process- andcell-level automation procedures.andP;  TQC incorporates on-line statisticalprocess control, engineering quality analysis and manufacturing qualitymanagement.andM;The demands on such a TQC system are high.andP;  The user interface must berelatively simple at the operator level, the hardware and physical networkmust be robust to reduce maintenance, and the system's ability to collectdata must be vast.andP;  Translating information from the analog world ofshop-floor gauges and machines into a digital one has never been easy.andO;According to DEC, the bulk of code in quality-control systems is devoted toshop-floor data acquisition.andM;Thus, CIM software requires libraries of standard shop-floor devicecontroller drivers, such as programmable logic controllers and computernumerical controllers.andM;For discrete-manufacturing environments, the software must also be capable ofproviding a range of time-based transactions.andP;  Short-term events, such aspart completion, must be rolled into long-term events, such as batchcompletion.andP;  The consolidated data would ideally be shipped to amanufacturing resources planning system.andM;Developing the interfaces between different applications accounts for much ofthe cost of a TQC system.andP;  No less important is the interface betweenterminal and user.andP;  According to an AMR survey, 70 percent of themanufacturing managers in Fortune 500 companies polled said that people arethe chief barrier to CIM.andM;The key here is that as control of the production system moves closer to theplant floor, its users will require what is referred to as &quot;enabling&quot;technology.andP;  Enabling technology, for example, permits process engineers whohave no programming skills to develop their own applications.andM;Often, the capabilities that a CIM system presents to blue-collar workers arethreatening to them as well as to their managers.andP;  According to AMR'sresearch, 67 percent of Fortune 500 companies surveyed said managers wereresistant to the changes required by automation, and 37 percent said laborunions were a significant stumbling block.andM;For those with little computer literacy, graphical user interfaces will easesome of the pain of transition, but not all of it.andP;  For example, many of theemployees at one tire company lack basic reading and mathematical skills thatwould enable them to use data presented to them on the screen, whatever theformat.andP;  And when an assembly-line employee is given the power to manipulatedata and make decisions--such as stopping the line--he or she must also betaught decision-making skills to ensure that this power is used effectively.andM;Companies approaching a comprehensive CIM implementation must be aware ofthis non-technological, non-financial hurdle.andP;  The solution may be found onlythrough adequate education, often under the auspices of an outsideconsultant.andP;  Through training and education, plant-floor employees andmanagers can be given the self-confidence and skills necessary to distributedecision making throughout the line or across cells.andM;Such education is an added, frequently overlooked cost of a CIM system.andP;  Butthe costs of failing to train employees may be high as well, if untrainedworkers simply neglect to use the system, or, worse yet, if the CIM system isdeveloped entirely without their input and as a result is disregarded as muchas possible.andM;Union involvement may also mean that the implementation ofcomputer-integrated manufacturing will require restructuring of existing jobclassifications.andP;  If employees are expected to share the responsibility ofline-level decision making, they in turn will expect to be paid more forthese new responsibilities.andM;Thus, the effects of an integrated CIM system on the workplace extend beyondthe simple cost vs.andP;  benefits equation.andP;  The ripple effects, fromemployer-employee relations to the accounting methods used for manufacturers,are extensive.andM;In light of CIM's potential to alter structures throughout an organization,as well as the large hardware component of its cost, it makes sense to applyCIM in measured doses today, preparing the site for more extensiveinstallations later.andP;  Through pilot projects, companies can get a firmestimate of the time required to develop the applications and interprogramcommunications that will be needed for a particular manufacturing environmenttomorrow.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
