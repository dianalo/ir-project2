Frank Cordaro in Logan, Iowa, granted sanctuary to a manure spreader.    Rev. Cordaro hauled the spreader from a parishoner's farm and parked it on the lawn of his St. Anne's Catholic Church so that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. wouldn't repossess it to settle a loan from a failed bank. &quot;I'd like to see more people bring equipment to churchyards and make the FDIC take it off,&quot; he says. &quot;They're breaking people out here.&quot;    As the economic troubles of farmers and the banks that lend to them mount in the Midwest, so do tensions between financially strapped farmers and the FDIC, the agency charged with picking up the pieces of failed banks. Under pressure from farmers and Congress, the FDIC is an agency torn between policy, politics and human suffering.    Much sympathy is with the farmer. &quot;While the (bank) failures have been a bad dream for the FDIC,&quot; says Sen. Tom Harkin (D., Iowa), &quot;they have become a nightmare for borrowers.&quot; Sen. Harkin sponsored a provision to a banking bill approved by the Senate last month directing the FDIC to draw up guidelines &quot;to minimize adverse economic effects caused by its actions on individual debtors in the community.&quot;    A concern at the FDIC is that the tensions can spill into violence. Two Sargent, Neb., brothers are awaiting federal court trials for allegedly using shotguns last February to threaten FDIC workers who were attempting to execute a court order to repossess cattle. The livestock were collateral for a loan from a bank that failed in 1985.    A federal grand jury indictment in Omaha charges that one of the brothers smashed a window in an FDIC vehicle with the butt of his shotgun and the other fired a shot into the air, warning that the next blast would be &quot;between your (expletive) eyes.&quot; The brothers deny they are guilty of the charges against them.    Open violence is rare, but not unprecedented. Last year, a bomb threat forced FDIC workers out of a failed bank in Tecumseh, Neb. And Marcia Carrigan, head of the FDIC's Omaha office, still shudders when she recalls the 1984 closing of Bank of Verdigre andamp; Trust Co. in Verdigre, Neb. The FDIC took over about 65 delinquent loans, she recalls, and some of those borrowers became upset when the agency laid claim to their earnings from crop sales. Then, one Sunday morning in February 1985, a fire broke out in the FDIC's office in Verdigre, causing minor damage. The authorities said it was arson.    Farm banks account for a major portion of the rising numbers of bank failures. Of the 138 federally insured banks that failed last year, 59 had made more than a quarter of their loans in agriculture. More than half of these farm banks were in Kansas, Iowa, Missouri and Nebraska.    When a bank is declared insolvent and closed, the FDIC is named receiver of the failed institution. In most cases, the agency is able to sell the closed bank, along with its good loans, to a healthy institution. The FDIC keeps the bad loans and tries to salvage what it can, with the proceeds going to a fund that insures bank deposits.    FDIC officials say that foreclosure is a last resort and that it has also settled loans for as little as 30 cents on the dollar. But critics contend that the agency still is treating many farmers unfairly.    &quot;The FDIC went into this exceptionally aggressive,&quot; says Corky Jones, a corn and soybean farmer in Brownville, Neb., who is national president of the American Agriculture Movement. While he says the FDIC has gotten more flexible in recent months, he complains that some agency officials are still &quot;too eager to foreclose.&quot;    Even when settlements are lenient, critics say that the FDIC, burdened by the large increase in bank failures, sometimes takes too long before deciding what to do.    Sen. Harkin tells of one Iowa farm family who offered the FDIC a partial payment for a loan. The FDIC accepted the proposed settlement 18 months later. &quot;During that time the family had become so desperate, they had to resort to food stamps and their local church to eat and they found it impossible to pay their bills,&quot; Sen. Harkin says. &quot;Of course, this meant that their creditors who owed the FDIC money found themselves deeply in trouble as well.&quot;    To try to ease such problems, the FDIC has adopted special procedures for farmers. For instance, when the agency has a lien against the sale of a farmer's production, it has begun returning as much as $1,000 a month from the proceeds from the sale to the farmer for living expenses, plus money to pay for the maintenance and operation of his equipment. Last year, the Omaha office collected $6.1 million from the sale of borrowers' crops and turned $3.7 million of it back to the farmers.    Sen. Harkin argues that with a little extra leeway on the FDIC's part &quot;and a willingness to establish procedures where actions occur quickly, businesses can survive and in many cases make a complete payment of their debts.&quot;    But nobody expects an end anytime soon to the current tensions between farmers and the FDIC. Even when shots aren't fired, dealing with angry and hard-pressed farmer-borrowers can leave FDIC workers wounded. &quot;You go home wondering if you're doing the right thing,&quot; says Ms. Carrigan in the agency's Omaha office. &quot;I've lost many a night's sleep over it, especially when you see them so distraught. . . . But we've got a job to do.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
