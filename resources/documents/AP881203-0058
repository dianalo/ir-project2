(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The federal grand jury investigating JimBakker and former associates at PTL may return indictments thisweek, a newspaper reported Saturday.   Unidentified sources told The Charlotte Observer on Friday thatthey believe prosecutors are ready to end the 17-month investigationand intend to present an indictment for the grand jury to consider.   ``I would guess they're going to come back with an indictmentnext week. I don't know what day,'' a source told The Observer.   Bakker's attorney, Jim Toms, who has met with prosecutors, saidhe believes Bakker will be charged with mail and wire fraudinvolving PTL ``lifetime partnerships'' and with tax violations inconnection with PTL money spent on Bakker.   Lifetime partners received free lodging at PTL's Christian themepark in Fort Mill, S.C., in exchange for big contributions to theevangelical empire built by Jim and Tammy Bakker before his downfallin a sex and money scandal in 1987.   Prosecutors have reserved a courtroom for Monday throughWednesday for the grand jury to meet. Toms and other sources saidthey believe prosecutors on Monday will explain what charges theybelieve ought to be brought.   U.S. Attorney Tom Ashcraft refused to discuss the secretproceedings.   Last month, Bakker, former PTL executive Richard Dortch and RoeMessner, PTL's former chief builder, received letters fromprosecutors informing them that they are targets of theinvestigation and inviting them to testify.   Only Messner, a Wichita, Kan., contractor, accepted. He refusedto talk with reporters after testifying Wednesday and Thursday.   Bakker resigned from PTL in a scandal over the payment of hushmoney to Jessica Hahn, with whom he had a sexual encounter in ahotel room in 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
