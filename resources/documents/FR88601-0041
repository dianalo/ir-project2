Background</ITAG>The DFARS revisions are required by the 1987 Omnibus Appropriations ContinuingResolution (Pub. L. 99-591). Under the proposed coverage offerors/contractorsin certain noncompetitive acquisitions are required to certify that theprices offered to the Government for spare or repair parts that the contractoralso offers to the general public, are no higher than the lowest commercialprice at which such parts were sold during the most recent regular periodof not less than 30 days duration, or submit a written justification ofthe difference. This proposed rule is being considered for the purposeof implementing 10 U.S.C. 2323. Comments received on this proposed rulewill be considered in formulating the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The proposed rule adds DFARS 215.813, DFARS 252.215-7004 and 252.215-7005to implement Section 101(c) of Pub. L. 99-591. Under the new coverage,offerors/contractors in certain noncompetitive acquisitions are requiredto certify that the prices offered for spare or repair parts that the contractoroffers for sale to the general public are no higher than the lowest commercialprice at which such parts were sold during the most recent regular monthly,quarterly, or other period of not less than 30 days in duration, for whichsales data are reasonably available. Such coverage is not expected to havea significant impact on a substantial number of small entities becausethe information required should be readily available to small businessessince they are less likely to have decentralized sales records and thelarge volume of sales transactions normally associated with larger businesses.An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has therefore not been performed.Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties.Comments from small entities concerning the affected DFARS Subpart willalso be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such commentsmust be submitted separately and cite DFARS Case 88-610D in correspondence.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The rule does contain information collection requirements which requirethe approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. DoD is preparing for submissionto OMB a request for review and approval of a new information collection.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 215 and 252</ITAG>Government procurement.<ITAG tagnum="6">Charles W. Lloyd,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Executive Secretary, Defense Acquisition Regulatory Council.</ITAG>Therefore, it is proposed to amend 48 CFR Parts 215 and 252 as follows:1. The authority citation for 48 CFR Parts 215 and 252 continues to readas follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 5 U.S.C. 301, 10 U.S.C. 2202, DoD Directive 5000.35,and DoD FAR Supplement 201.301.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 215_CONTRACTING BY NEGOTIATION</ITAG>2. Sections 215.813 through 215-813-6 are added to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">215.813</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Commercial pricing certificates for spare or repair parts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">215.813-1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>(a) ``Lowest commercial price,'' as used in this section, means the lowestprice at which a sale was made to the general public of a particular part.Such term does not include the price at which a sale was made_(1) To any agency of the United States;(2) To any customer for resale after such customer performs a service orfunction in connection with such part that increases the cost of the part,unless the agency procuring the part can demonstrate that the agency isprocuring the part before such service or function has been performed byany such customer (see 215-813-5(b));(3) To a subsidiary, affiliate, or parent business organization of thecontractor, or any other branch of the same business entity;(4) To any customer at a price that, for the purpose of making a donation,has been substantially discounted below the fair market value or regularprice of such part; or(5) To a customer located outside the United States.(b) ``Spare or repair part,'' as used in this section, means any individualpiece, part, subassembly, or component which is furnished for the logisticsupport or repair of an end item and not as an end item itself.<ITAG tagnum="80">215.813-2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy.</ITAG>The Government should not purchase spare or repair parts offered for saleto the general public at a price that exceeds the lowest commercial priceat which such parts are sold by the contractor unless the price differenceis clearly justified by the seller, or unless exempt under 215.813-4. Tothis end, 10 U.S.C. 2323 requires an offeror to certify that the priceoffered is not more than its lowest commercial price, or to submit a writtenstatement specifying the amount of any difference and providing justificationfor that difference. Because the forces of the competitive marketplaceshould ensure that the Government does not pay too high a price for commercialspare or repair parts, commercial pricing certificates are necessary onlywhen these forces are not present in a particular contract action.<ITAG tagnum="80">215.813-3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Applicability.</ITAG>Except as provided in 215.813-4, the contracting officer shall requestthat a commercial pricing certificate be submitted in connection with anyoffer/proposal covering spare or repair parts which is submitted in connectionwith any of the following:(a) Contracts awarded using other than competitive procedures, that is,those procedures under which an agency enters into contracts pursuant toother than full and open competition (see Subpart 206.3).(b) Contract modifications including contract modifications for additionalitems but not including contract modifications that are within the scopeand under the terms of the contract, such as contract modifications issuedpursuant to the Changes clause (but see paragraph (e) of this section),or funding and other administrative changes.(c) Noncompetitive orders under the provisioning line item of a contractor under a Basic Ordering Agreement or under a similar arrangement.(d) Definitization of price or a letter contract, unpriced order, or othercontract, modification, or order awarded without a definitive price. Thecommercial pricing certificate is not required prior to the initial award,but rather will be submitted with the offer or proposal to definitize.(e) Any modification issued pursuant to the Changes clause which resultsin the providing of new or different commercial spare or repair parts.<ITAG tagnum="80">215.813-4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Exemptions from commercial pricing certificates.</ITAG>The contracting officer shall not request that a commercial pricing certificatebe submitted when_(a) Using the simplified small purchase procedures of Part 213;(b) An order is placed under an indefinite delivery type contract. (A certificateis required in connection with the award without full and open competitionof an indefinite delivery type contract.);(c) The contracting officer determines that obtaining the commercial pricingcertificate is not appropriate because of:(1) National security considerations, or(2) Significant differences in quantities, quality, delivery, or otherterms and conditions of the contract from commercial contract terms;(d) An order is placed under the procedures established by the GeneralServices Administration for its multiple award schedule program.(e) Using the sealed bid procedures of Part 214.<ITAG tagnum="80">215.813-5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedures. </ITAG>(a) When commercial pricing certificates are required in accordance with215.813-3, the contracting officer shall request the certificate as setforth in paragraph (b) of the clause at 252.215-7004, Certification ofCommercial Pricing for Spare or Repair Parts, and ensure that the certificateis submitted at the appropriate time. The certificate may be requestedthrough the use of a solicitation provision such as the one at 252.215-7005.Circumstances may make advance agreements desirable between an offeror/contractorand a contracting officer in areas such as detailed repetitive justifications,determinations to include sales to persons or corporations for resale andthe time period covered by the certificate. Provided the Government's interestsare adequately protected, contracting officers may consider these typesof arrangements as a means of lessening the administrative burdens of certificatesof commercial pricing. (b) A contracting officer may make a determination that the definitionof ``lowest commercial price'' in the clause at 252.215-7004 shall includethe price at which a sale was made to any person or corporation for resaleby the person or corporation. In making this determination, the contractingofficer must be able to demonstrate that the spare or repair parts arebeing procured by the contracting officer under the same terms and conditionsat which a sale was made to the person or corporation for resale. (c) The contracting officer shall request submission of a new certificatewhen the validity of the certificate originally submitted with an offer/proposalbecomes doubtful prior to award due to submission of a new or revised proposalor as a result of discussions. (d) If, before agreements on price, the contracting officer learns thatthe certificate is inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading, the contractingofficer shall immediately bring the matter to the attention of the offeror/contractor,request a revised certificate, and negotiate accordingly. (e) If, after award or agreement on price, the contracting officer learnsor suspects that a certificate was inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading,the contracting officer shall request, as appropriate, an audit under authorityof paragraph (c) of the clause at 252.215-7004. If the contracting officerdetermines that a certificate was inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading,the Government is entitled to an equitable price adjustment (see paragraph(d) of the clause at 252.215-7004). (f) Individual or class determinations made under 215.813-4(c) and advanceagreements and determinations under this subsection, shall be documentedin the contract file. (g) Possession of a contractor's Certificate of Commercial Pricing is nota substitute for examining and analyzing a contractor's proposal and determiningthat the prices offered are fair and reasonable. Notwithstanding the submissionof a Certificate of Commercial Pricing, Subpart 215.8 must be compliedwith. Particular attention should be paid to FAR 15.804-3(c) with regardto items which are substantially similar to commercial items sold in substantialquantities at established catalog or market prices. <ITAG tagnum="80">215.813-6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contract clauses. </ITAG>(a)(1) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 252.215-7004,Certification of Commercial Pricing for Spare or Repair Parts, in all solicitationsand contracts when a commercial pricing certificate is required in accordancewith 215.813-3, unless exempt under 215.813-4. (2) The contracting officer shall use the clause at 252.215-7004 with itsAlternate I when a determination has been made in accordance with 215.813-5(b).(b) The contracting officer may use the provision at 252.215-7005, Spareor Repair Parts Pricing Certifications, in solicitations when a certificateis required. The provision may also be appropriately modified and includedas a clause in contracts that provide for subsequent noncompetitive orderingof spare and repair parts and for which certificates will be required.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 252_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES </ITAG>3.
