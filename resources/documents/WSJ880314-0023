In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Salomon Brothers said it holds 3.1 million depositary receipts representing 3,105.3 Series C preferred shares.    The filing said that Valhi Inc., the controlling shareholder of NL Industries, is considering the redemption of the Series C preferred for cash as part of a proposal to combine Valhi with NL Industries. According to the filing, the Series C preferred was &quot;issued as an interim step in the proposed spin-off of NL Chemicals Inc.,&quot; a unit of NL Industries. Valhi is based in Dallas and controlled by Harold Simmons.    Salomon Brothers, a New York-based investment banking firm, said it believes the value of NL Chemicals stock &quot;would be greater than the cash redemption price&quot; of the Series C preferred.    Houston-based NL Industries, an oilfield services and equipment company, declined to comment on the Salomon filing. </TEXT></DOC>
