(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An intelligence-gathering satellitecapable of spying on 80 percent of the Soviet Union will be carriedby the secret space shuttle mission scheduled for late this month,an industry magazine reports.   ``When fully deployed, the spacecraft will have a span as largeas 150 feet,'' Aviation Week and Space Technology reported. ``It hasthe characteristics of an imaging radar or optical reconnaissanceinvolving digital imaging, or both.   ``The radar transmission is designed to penetrate cloud cover andwould be valuable in both ocean and land surveillance,'' themagazine said in its Nov. 7 issue, available Friday.   Space shuttle Atlantis and its five-man crew will be flying thethird classified Defense Department shuttle mission, and thePentagon and NASA have cloaked most details about it in secrecy.NASA processing director Conrad Nagel said the agency was aiming forlaunch on Nov. 28 or 29.   Aviation Week said the satellite will be launched into an orbitthat will enable it to look down on 80 percent of the Soviet Union.At least three of the 27 earlier shuttle missions flew over the sameSoviet territory.   The magazine said the satellite will be dropped overboard fromthe cargo bay by an astronaut using the craft's 50-foot robot arm.Two astronauts are prepared to take a space walk in case there istrouble deploying the satellite.   Aviation Week said estimates of the cost of the satellite, filledwith advanced-technology equipment, range as high as $500 million.It said the satellite could be retrieved on a later shuttle missionand returned to Earth for improvements.   Sources who insisted on anonymity earlier told The AssociatedPress that Atlantis would carry an intelligence-gathering satellitethat would help U.S. intelligence officials verify that the Sovietswere complying with arms control treaties.   The sources also said the astronauts will conduct severalexperiments aimed at defining man's role as a military observer inspace. The tests would involve coordination with troop and shipmovements and missile launchings on Earth.   The space shuttle program resumed Sept. 29 with the successfullaunch of Discovery, the first shuttle launched since the fatalexplosion of the shuttle Challenger in January 1986.   During the hiatus, the Pentagon relied on conventional rockets tosend military payloads into space.</TEXT></DOC>
