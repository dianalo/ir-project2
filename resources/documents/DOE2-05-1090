The resultwas as follows: Eluted solution used was octane sulfonic acid of 0.1mM with maximum flow rate 0.7 ml/min. By this, 5 types of carboxylicacid were simultaneously measured in roughly 20 min., with low variationcoefficient of 4% or less; minimum detectable concentration was alsoas low as ppb level. But, oxalic acid and malonic acid were poor in separationand required ordinary IC method. Carboxylic acid decomposes in 1 - 2days if left in a room, but is stable over 3 months by the addition ofHC1(II) or chloroform. Most abundant components were formic acid andacetic acid showing the concentration of average, 0.181 and 0.112 micro-gram/mol:other components were 0.018 micro-gram/ml or less.
