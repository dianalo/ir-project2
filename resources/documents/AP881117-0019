They all were eager to help O'Brien in hiscampaign to unseat Republican Rep. Tom Tauke.   Their appearances weren't enough. O'Brien got only 36 percent ofthe vote on Election Day.   But for Sens. Simon, Bradley and Biden, the effort wasn't wasted.For them, a chance to campaign in Iowa, to make a few friends in thestate that holds the nation's first presidential caucuses every fouryears, is no waste of time.   Other familiar Democratic faces who campaigned in Iowa in 1988were Jesse Jackson, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the winner ofthe 1988 Iowa caucuses, and former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona.   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee bypassed Iowa during the caucuscampaign and later as well, but he was on the road elsewhere.   With the exception of Bradley, those are all leftover names from1988.   Jackson, Gephardt and Gore are considered likely contenders forthe 1992 Democratic nomination.   Michael Dukakis, the defeated 1988 Democratic nominee, was ``backat a job I love,'' being governor of Massachusetts. At hisappearances immediately after his defeat, supporters chanted ``'92,'92, '92,'' but Dukakis refused to discuss the possibility ofanother presidential campaign.   Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen became something of a folk figure as theDemocratic vice presidential candidate and presumably will receive alot of early attention as a prospect for the top spot on the ticketin four years. But Bentsen will be 71 years old in 1992.   Another familiar name that comes up every four years is Gov.Mario Cuomo of New York. Twice he's been mentioned and twice he'sdeclined to run.   Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas decided against running n 1988, butis certain to take another look.   ``He doesn't know what he'll be doing in four years,'' saidspokesman Mike Gauldin.   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, a favorite of Southern conservatives,also considered a 1988 run and opted out.   ``It's premature to be talking about personalities in '92, me oranybody else,'' said Nunn.   ``It's much too early, premature and downright immature to betalking about 1992 politics,'' said Jackson, when it became clear onElection Night that Dukakis was going down to defeat.   But while two-time presidential candidate Jackson brushed offtalk about 1992, he already has formed a political action committee,Keep Hope Alive, and declared his intention to be involved inmunicipal elections in 1989. He's certain to be involved in thehigh-profile battle for mayor of New York where incumbent Ed Kochwill face a strong challenge fueled in part by his bitter clash withJackson during the 1988 New York presidential primary.   Democratic Party chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr. hopes the potential1992 candidates are serious when they say it's premature to startthe next presidential campaign.   ``Our focus ought to be on 1990,'' said Kirk, who called that thekey year for determining which party has the edge when congressionaland legislative redistricting takes place after the 1990 Census.   That process, occurring once every 10 years, is certain to shiftmore House seats from the Rust Belt to the Sun Belt and force aredrawing of lines that could change the political makeup of scoresof House districts.   Maybe Kirk can keep Democrats focused on redistricting.   But as he is well aware, the first poll assessing the potential1992 field is almost certain to be taken before Christmas 1988.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Donald M.
