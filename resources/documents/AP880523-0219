Hard-core flyfishermen disdain hatchery-raised trout, but defenders say thatwithout extensive stocking, thousands of anglers would never catcha fish at all. This is the second of three articles.</TEXT><BYLINE>By TAD BARTIMUS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DANIEL, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It was a fisherman's fantasy come true:swimming together in an undulating black wave were 30,000 trout.   There was, however, a problem for the eager angler. Each of thecreatures darting around in the concrete tank's 46.5-degree waterwas less than half an inch long.   At the Daniel Hatchery, one of 12 run by Wyoming's Game and FishDepartment, three employees raise nearly 2 million fish every year.The dozen state hatcheries ``planted'' 32 million fish in Wyomingwaters in 1987. Nearly all were trout.   They are kept in temperature-controlled indoor and outdoortanks, depending on their size, and are fed a high protein ``troutchow'' composed of fish meal, liver and grain. A pathologistregularly checks them for viral diseases and parasites.   State biologists continually survey lake and stream fishpopulations and place orders for varieties according to need.   The Daniel Hatchery raises seven kinds of trout as well asArctic grayling and Kokanee salmon. The fish range from fry lessthan an inch long, through fingerlings, up to catchables 8 inchesand larger. There are even lunkers, 3-pounders that producespawning eggs, which are released into streams as 6-year-olds whentheir egg quality declines.   Hatchery fish production is at an all-time high in many states,although budget cutbacks in the Reagan administration have affectedsome government programs.   ``The demand for fish is increasing every year and we'reproducing the maximum here that we can,'' said Daniel manager DickCheeney.   That's because all over America right now fishermen areuntangling lines, buying licenses and plunging with gusto intoanother season of hope.   A recent Gallup poll ranked fishing as the nation's second mostpopular outdoor sport, just behind swimming and ahead of bicycling.   The U.S. Department of the Interior found in a 1986 survey that58.5 million citizens call themselves fishermen. In 1962 only 13million people fished for fun.   In proclaiming June 6-12 National Fishing Week, President Reagansaid, ``Fishing greatly aids our economy, it is a source ofhealthful food, promotes respect for sound conservation and for thebounty and wonder of our natural resources, and introduces millionsof people to the benefits of outdoor recreation.''   The Sports Fishing Institute, founded by tackle manufacturers in1949, estimates Americans spend $28.2 billion a year on the hobby.About 750,000 jobs either directly or peripherally depend on it.   Industry experts agree fly fishing is especially popular amongBaby Boomers who have more money and time to commune with nature.   ``It's an ethical sport that's caught the imagination of youngerpeople,'' said Bob Herbst, executive director of Trout Unlimited, a55,000-member organization devoted to enjoying and improvingcold-water fisheries.   Herbst said the sport seemed to ``attract the hard-driving youngexecutives because it involves a little intellect, it's more thanjust dangling a worm in a body of water.''   Tom Rosenbauer, editor of the Orvis News, a newsletter publishedby America's oldest mail-order company, goes fly-fishing on hislunch hour.   ``The people here in the office fish before work and afterwork,'' said Rosenbauer, who is based at Orvis' headquarters inManchester, Vt.   ``There are three or four little brook trout streams right inthe middle of town that fish very well at noon on a size 14 YellowHumpy.''   He said that in the past 15 years there had been a steady 10percent to 15 percent growth in Orvis' fly-fishing equipmentbusiness.   ``Then last year there was a 50 percent-plus jump in our tacklesales,'' Rosenbauer said. ``Our fly-fishing schools now fill upwith waiting lists. I think the boom everybody's been predictingfor the past decade is here.''   In the West, fly fishing is a vital and growing part of stateeconomies heavily dependent on tourism. Wyoming, Montana, Idaho andColorado, which have depressed agricultural and natural resourcesectors, compete against each other for the big bucks brought in byvacationing anglers.   The growing dependence of tourism dollars on prime fish habitathas engendered a debate over the merits of stocking blue ribboncold-water streams and lakes with hatchery-raised fish.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
