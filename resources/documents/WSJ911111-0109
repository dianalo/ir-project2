Toyota's announcement, which is scheduled for Mondaymorning in Japan, follows by less than four days Nissan MotorCorp.'s decision that it will boost purchases of Americanauto parts by 40%, to $3.3 billion, during the next twoyears.</LP><TEXT>   Other Japanese auto makers also are pledging to buy moreU.S.-made parts. And several, including Toyota, areestablishing programs to train U.S. parts suppliers in theirengineering, production and purchasing methods.   Toyota is expected to announce that by 1994 it will buy$3.6 billion of U.S.-made vehicle components for use in theU.S. An additional $1 billion of parts would be shipped toJapan. Purchases of machine tools and other goods would total$400 million.   The promises by Japanese auto makers to buy more Americangoods offers a potential bonanza for some U.S. partsoperations at a time when the Big Three auto makers areslashing the ranks of suppliers and demanding pricerollbacks.   U.S. trade officials, led by Commerce Secretary RobertMosbacher, can also claim a partial victory. In recentmonths, Mr. Mosbacher and other U.S. negotiators have steppedup public pressure on Japanese industry to buy more U.S.-madegoods. Auto parts are one of the largest single components ofthe overall U.S.-Japan trade deficit.</TEXT></DOC>
