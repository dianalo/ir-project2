The ruling, released Friday, is the first decision made publicby U.S. immigration officials stemming from the Chinesegovernment's crackdown on protesters in early June, which resultedin the deaths of hundreds, possibly thousands of people in Beijing.   The students, who are engaged to be married, took part in aprotest against the crackdown in Tokyo and fled to the UnitedStates on Aug. 7, saying they had received threatening telephonecalls.   ``Until China changes its policy of death, fear and terroragainst dissidents, foreign students involved in thedemocratization movement should not be forcibly returned to RedChina by the government of the United States,'' said ImmigrationJudge Bernard Hornbach.   ``This is a turning point in our lives,'' one of the students,Luo Jian Guang, said in Chinese at a news conference, asinterpreted by his lawyer, Eugene Wong.   ``I came to this country and for the first time am breathing theair of freedom,'' Luo, 32, said.   ``I am very happy,'' his fiancee, Hoy Yu Yi, 27, said inEnglish. Wong interpreted another of her statements as saying shewas taught in China that ``America is a cold and inhuman society,''and was pleased to discover otherwise.   Hornbach's ruling would allow the couple to seek permanentresident status. Its legal conclusions are not binding on otherimmigration judges unless it is appealed by the government andupheld by the Board of Immigration Appeals.   ``We're reviewing the decision to determine what action, if any,we're going to take,'' said David Ilchert, district director of theImmigration and Naturalization Service.   Wong said the decision, if it became a precedent, could helpother Chinese students living overseas, including some 73,000 inthe United States. But he said he did not expect a wave of asylumapplications, in part because President Bush has given U.S.-basedChinese students an additional year of protection againstdeportation.   Wong said the U.S. government had formally opposed asylum beforethe hearing but did not contradict testimony by a scholar, ajournalist and others about the dangers to dissidents in China _crucial points for Hornbach's ruling.   The ruling contrasted with decisions by immigration judges thathave rejected all but a fraction of applications for asylum byrefugees from El Salvador and Guatemala.   In those cases, the U.S. government has generally denied thatCentral Americans face a provable danger if deported, and hasargued that they entered the United States for economic rather thanpolitical reasons.   Luo, an international business student, and Ms. Hoy, studyinglinguistics, attended a protest rally outside the Chinese embassyin Tokyo on June 4, the second day of the killings in and aroundBeijing's Tiananmen Square. Both signed a petition that wasdelivered to the embassy, and said their pictures were taken byembassy officials.   After the demonstration, they said they got anonymous phonecalls telling them they would face the consequences when theyreturned to China.   After arriving in the United States, both were jailed initiallyand later released on $5,000 bail. They said they plan to studyEnglish, look for work and marry soon.</TEXT></DOC>
