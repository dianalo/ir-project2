An outburst of joy spread throughout the country as news brokeearly in the morning that the hijacking of Kuwait Airways Flight422 was over, with the remaining 31 hostages released.   The streets of this tiny oil-rich nation on the Persian Gulfwere crowded with cars decorated with the four-color Kuwaiti flag _green, white, red and black _ spread over their hoods.   Drivers and pedestrians clapped, sang and cheered. Car horns andshouts of ``Mabrouk!'' (``Congratulations!'') filled the morningair that normally is quiet during the current holy month ofRamadan, when Moslems abstain from eating and drinking from dawn todusk.   The state-run radio broadcast a special song glorifying theemir, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, and his government for their``triumph'' over terrorism.   Messages poured into the offices of the ruler and his ministers,congratulating them on rejecting demands of the pirates to releasefrom Kuwaiti jails 17 convicted pro-Iranian bombers.   ``This is a happy moment for the nation,'' a radio announcerdeclared. ``We congratulate ourselves, our government and our emir,and we offer the leadership garlands of roses and jasmine.''   Another radio announcer, her voice choked with emotion, readmessages of support and greetings from citizens to the government.   Shortly after the hostages' release, the Kuwaiti Cabinet met inan emergency session to thank Algeria for its help but condemnedthe hijackers' ``cowardly'' actions, ``part of a conspiracy againstthe Arabs.''   The Cabinet told Kuwaitis their ``courageous stand andsolidarity with the leadership ... provides a striking example topeople of the world in steadfastness versus terrorism and the firmrejection of blackmail.''   Kin of the released hostages kept their homes open, while womeninside trilled their voices in the traditional expression of joy.Women in neighboring houses echoed in kind, and the desert musiccrept from one block to another.   Multicolored light bulbs and flags decorated facades of houses.The merriment was to continue through Thursday, when the freed 24passengers and seven crew members are scheduled to arrive fromAlgeria. Kuwait was the original destination of the jet, which washijacked after it took off from Bangkok on April 5 with 112 peopleaboard.   The Kuwait News Agency reported from Algiers that the deal underwhich the ordeal was ended included an Algerian promise of safeconduct for the hijackers to either Lebanon or Iran.   Knowledgeable sources in the gulf, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said the hijackers left Algiers ``immediately'' afterthe release of the plane. KUNA said the nine hijackers slipped outin two groups 10 minutes apart before the hostages streamed out ofthe plane.   Ali Khaled Al-Sabah, brother of the three royal family membersamong the freed captives, said: ``My happiness in indescribable. Ifeel as if my brother and two sisters have been resurrected from aninevitable doom.   ``We feel deeply indebted to the Kuwaiti leadership and thegovernment of Algeria,'' he said in an interview.   Not forgotten were the two Kuwaiti men who were killed inCyprus, where the jet was flown after it was diverted to Mashhad,Iran.   Rashed Abdel-Aziz al-Rashed, minister of state for cabinetaffairs, said the country's leaders will ``remember with extremepride their two martyrs Abdullah al-Khaledi and Khaled Ayoub whowere assassinated by the hand of treachery and terrorism and whoremain a sympol of patriotism and honesty.''   Al-Rashed said the government ``expressed deep gratitude for theefforts made by Algerian officials, foremost President ChadliBendjedid and officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization,including Chairman Yasser Arafat.''</TEXT></DOC>
