Researchis intended to help the system take advantage of new opportunities inconservation, fuel substitution, and renewable energy. To establish theneeds and direct the program, several general studies have been conductedon energy use in the Canadian agricultural sector, to indicate patternsof use and energy requirements. Conservation techniques are being investigatedwith an emphasis on the economic viability of the technology; specificareas of work include equipment performance and operation, energy conservationand heat recovery systems for greenhouses and animal buildings, and energyconservation in the food processing industry. A close look is being madenot only to use agricultural wastes as energy sources, but also to growcrops specifically for energy use. Specific projects include investigationsin the combustion, pyrolysis and gasification of residues, and the productionof alcohols and vegetable oils for fuel. Other renewable energy sourcesbeing investigated are wind and solar energy. A list of energy researchcontracts is included. 7 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
