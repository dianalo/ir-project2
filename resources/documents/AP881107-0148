Pinochet, the army's commander, accepted the resignation of Gen.Humberto Gordon from the junta, said a statement issued by armyheadquarters. No reason was given for the resignation.   Gordon, 61, served on the junta since December 1986.   Hours later, another communique announced thar Gen. SantiagoSinclair, 58, an officer noted for his fervent personal loyalty toPinochet, had been picked by the 72-year-old president to replaceGordon.   The move apparently prompted the retirement of Gen. BrunoSiebert, public works minister and a Pinochet loyalist, who had moreseniority than Sinclair. Although leving the army, Siebert woul kepthis Cabinet post, the government said.   Until last week, Sinclair had been the army's deputycommander-in-chief, the man who handles the day-to-day business inthe service, as Pinochet devotes most of his time to the presidency.   Sinclair was replaced by Gen. Jorge Zincke, 54, considered less ahardliner than this predecessor.   Last week, Pinochet reshuffled the highest ranks of his army,sending 13 generals into retirement. He also promoted 10 brigadiersto the rank of general.   The junta also includes the commanders-in-chief of the navy, airforce and national police. It has served as a legislature in theabsence of a congress, which was disbanded when Pinochet seizedpower in a bloody 1973 military coup that ousted the elected leftistgovernment of Salvador Allende.   Pinochet last month lost a referendum in which citizens refusedto extend his rule to 1997 and voted for a transition to democracy.   Elections for a civilian congress and a successor to Pinochet arescheduled for December 1989.   Since the 1973 coup, the army's representative on the junta haschanged four times. The navy's representative, Adm. Jose Merino, hasbeen a junta member since the coup.</TEXT></DOC>
