A relationship was demonstratedbetween postexercise blood T/sub 3/ variation and functional coronarycirculation reverse. Hormonal baselines, and exercise-induced blood T/sub4/ changes were basically similar in patients with coronary disease ofdifferent severity. The results are suggestive of pathogenetic importanceof thyroid function in these patients.</TEXT></DOC>
