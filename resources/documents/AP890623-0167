The U.S. SupremeCourt said it was OK.   The young woman's discussion of explicit sex acts on a recordedline was part of a multibillion-dollar industry _ one that thenation's highest court ruled has the constitutional right to dobusiness, under some restrictions.   ``It's fantastic,'' Gloria Leonard, publisher of High Societymagazine and one of the leading dial-a-porn entrepreneurs, said ofthe ruling. ``We feel very triumphant. It really is a victory forthe First Amendment.''   Ms. Leonard opened her ``adult telephone service'' in 1983, whenthe newly broken-up telephone companies first offered dial-upinformation services to independent operators. Callers pay the fee,usually a few dollars, on their phone bill. In exchange, they canhear Bernice and her counterparts pant.   ``I know it started in 1983 because that's when the complaintsstarted coming in,'' said Diane Killory, general counsel of theFederal Communications Commission. The problem: Curious childrenwere calling the numbers umpteen times, racking upthousand-dollar-plus phone bills.   Parents were not amused. Neither were organizations such as theChildren's Legal Campaign in Phoenix, which has been mountinglobbying and legal campaigns to have dial-a-porn banned as acorrupting influence on minors.   ``There's no way to discriminate between adults and children inthe listening audience,'' said Len Munsil, the campaign's chieflawyer. ``And it's quite clear that these messages are harmful tochildren.''   In arguing her case, Ms. Leonard cites First Amendmentprotections of free speech. And she points to dial-a-porn's enormousfinancial success as evidence that it meets community standards ofacceptability.   ``At its peak, a number of years ago, we were getting half amillion calls a day,'' she said.``The number of willing customersfor these services is testimonial that it's a national standard.''   While her business is off dramatically _ down to perhaps 5,000calls a day, Ms. Leonard said _ she maintained that is because of aproliferation of competitors across the country, not any diminutionof interest in sex talk.   ``There are dozens if not hundreds of these numbers in everycity,'' she said. ``This stuff has really taken off, on amom-and-pop basis.'' However, a source in the Justice Department,who spoke on condition he not be identified, said many of thedial-a-porn services appear to have corporate links.   Whoever runs them, the opportunity for profit is enormous.Overhead is low: All that's required is a contract with the phonecompany for an information service number, a switchboard capable ofhandling many calls at once, and women and men willing to berecorded making suggestive words and noises. Some of the servicesprovide live telephone contacts.   While precise figures haven't been compiled, court records say180 million dial-a-porn calls were placed in New York in 1984.California has 204 separate dial-a-porn services, making up 25percent of its information service numbers. Nationwide, the industrydid an estimated $2 billion in business last year.   Efforts to reduce that business reach to its beginnings. Congressasked the FCC to look into restricting dial-a-porn in 1983, and lastyear the federal lawmakers decided to ban the services outright.   The Supreme Court ruling upholds the ban on obscene phonemessages, but rejects the ban on messages that are only ``indecent.''   There can be lesser restrictions on indecent calls, and Ms.Killory said the FCC likely will revive an earlier plan to requireaccess codes, scrambled messages or credit card payment fordial-a-porn. The idea is that children, lacking the codes,unscramblers or credit cards, could not make the calls.   Other steps are possible. Since the numbers begin with the samethree-digit exchange, Pacific Bell in California can cut off accessto customers who request it, and 800,000 have done so. And the banon obscene calls remains in effect _ though the difference betweenobscenity and indecency can be a difficult one to draw.   ``Many, many of these mesages are obscene,'' said Munsil, theporn line opponent. ``How do you decide which? We'll find out prettysoon, when the Justice Department starts enforcing the law.''</TEXT></DOC>
