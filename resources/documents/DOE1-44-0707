In theory, the convolution of a symmetric kernelwith a step function will yield a function that is symmetric about theinflection point. Conversely, by deconvolution, the kernel may be extractedfrom a measured distribution. In practice, however, due to the uncertaintiesand errors associated with the measurements and due to the singularitiesproduced in the fast Fourier transforms employed in the deconvolutionprocess, the kernels thus obtained and the dose distributions calculatedtherefrom, often exhibit erratic fluctuations. We propose a method thattransforms measured profiles to new, modified distributions so that theysatisfy the theoretical symmetry condition. The resultant kernel fromthe deconvolution is then free of fluctuations. We applied this methodto compute photon and electron dose distributions at various depths inwater and electron fluence distributions in air. The agreement betweenmeasured and computed profiles is within 1% in dose or 1 mm in distancein high dose gradient regions.</TEXT></DOC>
