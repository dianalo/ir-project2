Gen. Prosper Avril.   Rebels surrendered control of the international airport, whichreopened Tuesday for the first time since Sunday's coup attempt.   The U.S. Embassy said there no longer appeared to be any activeresistance in the army to the government.   ``I think there's no doubt that President Avril is completely incontrol now,'' said embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde. ``There are nosigns of a continuation of the coup attempt against him.''   A government communique identified the three alleged coupconspirators as Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu, commander of the LeopardsBattalion; Col. Phillipe Biamby, commander of the PresidentialGuard; and Col. Leonce Qualo, an administrative officer at armyheadquarters.   The government accused Rebu, Biamby and Qualo of a ``foolhardy''attempt to overthrow the government but said Avril had``magnanimously'' decided to free them from arrest on humanitariangrounds.   The communique, read on state-run TV, said the three were givensafe passage to the United States and were driven Monday night tothe Dominican Republic border for a flight out. Rebu wasaccompanied by his wife and four children.   Independent Radio Haiti Inter said Tuesday the Leopard Battalionhad accepted their new commander, Col. Lionel Claude _ a strongindication the insurgency had ended.   In Santo Domingo, Foreign Ministry sources said the Haitianscrossed the border at dawn. It was not known how long they wouldremain in the country before flying to the United States.   Release of the coup leaders was seen mainly as an attempt toappease soldiers of the elite, 300-man Leopard Battalion who weredemanding freedom for Rebu, their commander.   At least four mutinous soldiers in the battalion were killedMonday in skirmishes with troops loyal to Avril. The rebels brieflyseized control of national television station Monday before beingevicted by the Presidential Guard, and held the airport until lateMonday night.   The airport was reopened Tuesday, but all commercial flightsinto the country had been canceled earlier.   Schools remained closed, but most stores in Port-au-Prince, thecapital, were opened by midday Tuesday and traffic was picking upsteadily.   Avril, who assumed power six months ago in a coup led bynon-commissioned officers demanding democratic reforms, narrowlyescaped the attempt to topple his government. Loyal troops rescuedhim Sunday as he was being led to the airport to be deported to theDominican Republic.   Motives for the coup attempt remained unclear, and it was notknown whether Rebu, Biamby and Qualo were the only officersinvolved.   The state-run daily newspaper L'Union said Tuesday that Rebu wasthe ``main ringleader,'' and said he and the other conspiratorswere arrested and held under military guard at the National Palace.   There was speculation the coup attempt was prompted by fearsthat a crackdown by Avril on illegal drugs within the army mightlead to widespread dismissals of officers suspected of corruption.Avril last week dismissed four high-ranking army officers accusedof drug trafficking.   In Washington on Tuesday, the State Department denied giving theHaitian government a list of officers it wanted cashiered from thearmy because of alleged involvement in drug trafficking.   ``No, we did not,'' State Department spokeswoman MargaretTutwiler said when asked about the suggestion that the U.S. demandled to the attempted coup.   She said Richard Melton, a department envoy, had visited Haitiand discussed with Avril ``the broad range of U.S. interests inHaiti, which would include narcotic cooperation, along withdemocratic reforms, respect for human rights and credibledevelopment programs.''   ``We did not deliver any list of names; nor did we give any kindof ultimatum,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.   Radio Haiti Inter reported Tuesday that the army high commandhad discharged five lieutenant colonels. Among them was Lt. Col.Serge David, who has been linked in the past with brutal treatmentof dissident peasants.   The report gave no explanation for the dismissals, and thesignificance of the move was not immediately clear.   Hubert De Ronceray, a Haiti opposition politician, said hebelieved the coup attempt was financed by elements of the armylinked to the corrupt Duvalier dynasty and ``threatened to plungeHaiti into chaos.''   Another opposition leader, Rockefeller Guerre, said althoughAvril appeared to be in control, the situation remained volatile.   ``The affair is not over,'' he said. ``The contradictions in thearmy still exist and may explode at any time.''</TEXT></DOC>
