The standard represented an increase of0.5 mpg over the 1988 level, and a decrease of 1.0 mpg from the statutorylevel of 27.5 mpg. The Center for Auto Safety and Public Citizen jointlysubmitted a petition requesting the agency to reconsider its decision tolower the statutory standard. This notice denies the petition</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Mr. Orron Kee, Office of MarketIncentives, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 SeventhStreet, SW., Washington, DC 20590 (202-366-0846).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Title V of the Motor Vehicle Informationand Cost Savings Act specifies a CAFE standard of 27.5 mpg for each modelyear after 1984. (Title V was added to that Act by the Energy Policy andConservation Act.) However, the Act permits NHTSA to amend the statutorystandard to a level determined to be the ``maximum feasible average fueleconomy level.'' 15 U.S.C. 2002(a)(4). In determining the ``maximum feasibleaverage fuel economy level,'' the agency is required to consider the followingfour factors: technological feasibility, economic practicability, the effectof other Federal motor vehicle standards on fuel economy, and the needof the nation to conserve energy. NHTSA commenced the rulemaking proceeding regarding the model year (MY)1989 standard on August 25, 1988 with the issuance of a notice proposingto reduce the standards for MYs 1989-90 from the statutory level of 27.5mpg to some level from 26.5 mpg to 27.5 mpg (53 FR 33080, August 29, 1988).On September 30, 1988, NHTSA issued a final rule (53 FR 39275, October6, 1988) setting the MY 1989 corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standardfor passenger cars at 26.5 mpg. While this level represented a loweringof the statutory standard, it also represented a first step in returningto the statutory level of 27.5 mpg. NHTSA noted that its raising of thestandard from the MY 1986-88 level of 26.0 mpg was thus consistent withthe fact that the nation's conservation needs were greater then than theyhad been in 1985, when the agency first set the standard at 26.0 mpg. On November 7, 1988, the Center for Auto Safety (CFAS) and Public Citizen(PC) jointly submitted a petition requesting the agency to reconsider itsdecision to lower the statutory standard. The petitioners alleged thatNHTSA erred in reducing the standard for a number of reasons, including``(1) erroneously finding that Congress' energy conservation goals havebeen met, (2) finding General Motors' maximum feasible fuel economy as26.5 mpg when it is at least 27.5 mpg, (3) falsing (sic) blaming GeneralMotors' declining sales on CAFE standards, (4) misconstruing the EnergyPolicy and Conservation Act (EPCA) and its requirement that manufacturerssplit their fleet into domestic and foreign, and (5) erroneously findingCAFE standards will result in foreign companies selling more large cars.''The petitioners' arguments regarding the reduction of the MY 1989 standardare addressed below. The agency notes that in MY 1990 the standard will return to the statutorylevel of 27.5 mpg. See NHTSA's notice terminating its rulemaking regardingthe proposed reduction of the MY 1990 standard (54 FR 21985, May 22, 1989).NHTSA relied, in large measure, on the continuing increase in imports offoreign petroleum in taking this action. <ITAG tagnum="84">Energy Conservation Goals </ITAG>CFAS/PC's first contention is that ``NHTSA incorrectly stated that Congress'energy conservation goals have been met since 1988 overall CAFE was 28.7mpg.'' The petitioners argued that Congress intended energy conservationto be maximized by setting CAFE standards higher than 27.5 mpg if feasible.CFAS/PC also argued that even the statutory 27.5 mpg has not been met inactual use because actual on-road CAFE is at least 15 percent below thatcalculated under the statute. Finally, citing legislative history, thepetitioners asserted that, at the time EPCA was adopted, Congress' expresspurpose was to improve actual on-road new car fuel efficiency over 1974levels by 100% to 27.5 mpg by 1985 and reduce U.S. oil consumption by 3million barrels per day (MMB/D) by 1985. CFAS/PC contended that the actualsavings in 1985 when new car CAFE averaged 27.6 mpg was 1 MMB/D less thanthat, and that even the 1987 vehicle fleet with a CAFE of 28.3 mpg stillmissed Congress' 3 MMB/D goal and consumed 2.35 MMB/D less gasoline thanwhat it would have if the fleet had the same fuel economy as in 1975. NHTSA believes its statements that Congress' statutory goal of reachingan average fuel economy of 27.5 mpg for new cars has been met and exceededare correct, given that MY 1988 industrywide CAFE is 28.7 mpg. In settingthe 27.5 mpg goal, Congress included a requirement that CAFE be measuredaccording to ``the procedures utilized by the EPA Administrator for modelyear 1975 (weighed 55 percent urban cycle, and 45 percent highway cycle),or procedures which yield comparable results.'' 15 U.S.C. 2003(c). Theagency's statements that Congress' statutory goal has been met and exceededwere made in the context of that ``measuring stick.'' Use of that measuringstick in gauging progress is common. NHTSA has previously noted that the27.5 mpg goal is roughly twice the MY 1974 CAFE. Even Clarence M. Ditlow,Executive Director of CFAS, stated in the 1989 edition of <T3>The Car Book </T3>that ``Federal gas mileage standards are one of themost successful government programs ever adopted, with 1989 cars gettingmore than twice the fuel economy of 1974 cars.'' Thus, in at least onecontext, one of the petitioners apparently embraced the use of that measuringstick. NHTSA notes that the primary purpose of its statements was to draw attentionto two points: (1) The significant progress that has been made in improvingautomotive fuel efficiency since 1975, and (2) the fact that GM's and Ford'sdifficulties in achieving the 27.5 mpg statutory standard are partly anartifact of the ``two fleet rule.'' As discussed below, the two fleet ruleprevents GM and Ford from including their smallest, most fuel-efficientcars in their domestic CAFE (since those cars are largely imports). Thecountry of origin of a car, however, has no effect on its contributionto energy conservation. NHTSA notes that the point made in the MY 1989 decision that Congress'statutory goal of reaching an average fuel economy of 27.5 mpg for newcars has been met and exceeded should <T3>not </T3>be confused with a belief that energy conservation is no longerimportant. That decision expressly recognized that there is a continuingneed to conserve energy. 53 FR 39297. In addition, contrary to the implicationof the CFAS/PC petition, the decision to reduce the MY 1989 standard wasnot based on the point that Congress, 1975 energy conservation goals havebeen met. Even if there is more than one reasonable interpretation concerninghow those goals should be quantified, this is not an issue that was materialto the agency's MY 1989 decision.<ITAG tagnum="84">GM's MY 1989 CAFE Capability </ITAG>CFAS/PC's second contention is that NHTSA erred in finding that GeneralMotors' CAFE capability was 26.5 mpg instead of at least 27.6 mpg, thelevel that company achieved in MY 1988. The petitioners made several argumentsin support of this position. First, CFAS/PC argued that NHTSA relied on a net CAFE reduction of 0.5mpg for use of airbags and daytime running lights. According to the petitioners,however, GM is not offering daytime running lights on any 1989 models,and the market penetration of optional airbags is not projected to reachthe 33 percent level that would trigger inclusion of an option in fueleconomy ratings. (See 40 CFR Part 86.) The petitioners also argued thateven if actual sales of an option unexpectedly exceed 33 percent, thereis no adjustment to CAFE for that model year. Second, CFAS/PC argued that NHTSA erroneously lowered the CAFE standardto permit GM to boost performance and acceleration so that its sales wouldimprove, while GM could instead improve performance <T3>and </T3>fuel economy by use of 4-valve per cylinder engines. The petitionersargued that NHTSA did not adequately assess use of this technology eitherin assessing GM's fuel economy capabilities or in evaluating whether thatcompany made ``reasonable efforts'' to meet the 27.5 mpg standard. Third, CFAS/PC argued that NHTSA had concluded that EPA testing resultedin lower fuel economy for individual models from 1988 to 1989 due to uncertaintyin EPA testing. The petitioners asserted that comparison of the 1988 and1989 EPA test car lists do not show fuel economy reductions for the samevehicle which can be attributed to EPA testing variation, and requestedthat NHTSA make a model and configuration comparison to show this. Fourth, CFAS/PC argued that NHTSA erroneously lowered GM's fuel economycapability by at least 0.3 mpg on the grounds that GM has been wrong aboutCAFE projections by this magnitude in the past. The petitioners statedthat NHTSA should only look at those years where GM was requesting a CAFErelaxation to ``avoid letting GM stack the deck by submitting arbitrarilylow estimates.'' In addressing the petitioners' arguments concerning GM's MY 1989 fuel economycapability, it is again helpful to the review the agency's presentationof the issue in the MY 1989 preamble. A portion of that discussion follows(53 FR 39289-90):<ITAG tagnum="21">NHTSA has analyzed GM's MY 1989 CAFE projection and underlying plan.As discussed above, GM indicated in its September 1988 comment that itscurrent product plan is expected to result in a MY 1989 CAFE level of 27.2mpg. If NHTSA focused narrowly on GM's MY 1989 CAFE projection and itsMY 1988 CAFE achievement, it would presumably conclude that GM's MY 1989capability is above that of Ford. While manufacturer product plans aresubject to risks, GM's 27.2 mpg projection reflects that company's bestestimate of its MY 1989 CAFE, in light of its current product plan. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As discussed above, however, NHTSA believes that too narrow a focuson GM's MY 1988 CAFE achievement and MY 1989 CAFE projection could havethe effect of ratifying the significant loss in market share that companyhas experienced over the past several years and the significant job lossesthat accompanied that market loss. The agency believes that its analysisof GM's capability should also consider the CAFE level that company mightachieve if it more aggressively seeks to regain, in MY 1989, a portionof its lost market share. As indicated above, GM's current product planreflects the constraints of a 27.5 mpg standard, and the agency does notbelieve that it reflects the kinds of actions GM might wish to take torestore market share and jobs if there were a lower MY 1989 CAFE standard.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NHTSA recognizes that it is difficult to estimate what GM's CAFE capabilitywould be under a scenario of seeking to regain lost market share and jobs.Ford's recent CAFE experience suggests that a full line manufacturer canachieve approximately 26.5 mpg, while remaining fully competitive in allmarket segments. The agency has analyzed GM's product plan and concludedthat efforts by that company to restore its market share in less fuel-efficientmarket segments could, consistent with its capacity restraints, resultin a MY 1989 CAFE of 26.5 mpg or below. These efforts could include pricingand other actions to promote sales of compact, intermediate and luxurycars. In light of Ford's experience and NHTSA's analysis of the kinds ofactions GM might take to restore lost market share and jobs, the agencyconcludes that 26.5 mpg appropriately represents GM's MY 1989 CAFE capability.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">. . . NHTSA believes that in order for GM to be able to adequatelycompete in today's intensely competitive market, it must be able to accommodateconsumer demand for such attributes as larger engines and larger interiorspace. These actions come at a CAFE price, however, since they generallyreduce the fuel efficiency of a model. To the extent that GM is able toso accommodate consumer demand or otherwise increase the sales of its lessfuel-efficient vehicles, including less fuel-efficient compacts as wellas larger vehicles, its CAFE will decline, relative to what it achievedin MY 1988. This decline is in addition to that portion of the declinethat reflects unexpectedly high EPA test results in MY 1988.</ITAG>NHTSA believes that several points should be made concerning the petitioners'arguments about GM's MY 1989 CAFE capability. First, the petitioners areincorrect in asserting that the agency lowered GM's CAFE capability by0.5 mpg due to airbags and daytime running lights and another 0.3 mpg onthe grounds that GM has been wrong about CAFE projections by this magnitudein the past. The Final Regulatory Impact Analysis's (FRIA) discussion of GM's capabilitydid cite possible increased use of daytime running lights and airbags,as well as the uncertainty associated with GM's MY 1989 CAFE projection,including past forecasting errors by that company. However, the FRIA alsolisted other factors that could result in GM achieving a MY 1989 CAFE belowits 27.2 mpg projection, including greater sales of large cars and higherperformance compact cars as part of an effort to regain lost market share.Following this discussion, the FRIA noted that ``(i)f GM realizes evena portion of the CAFE penalty the agency postulates for increased performanceof compact cars or more large cars sales as descibed above, voluntarilyadopts half of the safety improvements described above, and realizes itshistoric CAFE prediction error by overestimating its CAFE, its CAFE couldactually be below 26.5 mpg.'' FRIA, p. V-101. The FRIA then stated that``(r)ecognizing that the actual product and market decisions of GM arelikely to differ from the illustrative examples given above, and that theeffect on fuel economy may likewise differ from the agency's example, theagency believes its analysis is nevertheless reasonable, given historicalinaccuracies in projecting CAFE, the current dictates of consumer demand,and the agency's policy not to have CAFE standards adversely affect safety.''NHTSA thus did not determine GM's MY 1989 CAFE capability by means of aformula that ascribed specific values to the factors cited by the petitioners.The agency also notes that the two factors cited by the petitioners werenot even included in the preamble's discussion of GM's capability. (Elsewherein the preamble, however, the agency noted the potential CAFE impact ofairbags and daytime running lights and expressed concern that overly stringentCAFE standards might discourage manufacturers from these and other voluntarysafety actions. See 53 FR 39296. Also, the agency has long recognized theuncertainties associated with manufacturer CAFE projections.) On the issue of uncertainties associated with manufacturer CAFE projections,the FRIA included an analysis of GM's pre-model-year reports. Like othermanufacturers, GM is required to submit the pre-model-year report duringDecember, and include, among other information, the company's projectedCAFE, vehicle configuration, base level and model type. These data aresubmitted to the agency some months into the model year in question. TheFRIA's analysis showed that, over a 10-year period, GM missed its estimatedCAFE projection by an average of more than 0.3 mpg. Sometimes GM overestimatedand other times underestimated its CAFE. The basic point is that, giventhe broad range of product offerings sold by GM and the many factors affectingthe sales of its different models, that company is unable to predict its<T3>exact </T3>CAFE even at the time of the pre-model-year report. The petitioners argued that NHTSA ``should only look at those years whereGM was requesting a CAFE relaxation to avoid letting GM stack the deckby submitting arbitarily low estimates,'' or ``(a)t the very least . .. average the differences rather than use the absolute value.'' The petitionersalso stated that NHTSA should ``include the differences for 1987 and 1988where GM underestimated its CAFE by 0.4 and 0.7 mpg respectively.'' NHTSA notes that there is no basis to support the petitioners' suggestionthat GM may have submitted arbitrarily low CAFE estimates in support ofits request for a lower CAFE standard. In addition, the agency did notmerely accept GM's CAFE projections but instead analyzed a great deal ofsupporting data including GM's detailed product plan and analyses providedby that company concerning how its plan differed from prior model yearsand why it had exceeded its CAFE estimates for prior model years. Sincethe purpose of the FRIA's analysis of GM's pre-model-year reports was toshow the uncertainties associated with CAFE projections, the agency seesno basis to adopt the petitioners' suggestion to average the differencesrather than use the absolute value. The issue is not whether, over a longperiod, the differences tend to average out but instead to recognize theinherent uncertainty associated with any CAFE projection for a particularmodel year. With respect to the petitioners' suggestion that NHTSA includethe differences for 1987 and 1988, the agency notes that the differencescited by CFAS/PC in fact illustrate the uncertainties associated with CAFEprojections. GM exceeded the particular CAFE projections cited by the petitioners.However, NHTSA has always recognized that the uncertainties associatedwith CAFE projections go in both directions. NHTSA believes that the preamble's discussion of GM's capability is clearand adequate. The agency noted the difficulty in estimating what GM's CAFEcapability would be under a scenario of seeking to regain lost market shareand jobs, recognized that Ford's CAFE experience suggests that a full linemanufacturer can achieve approximately 26.5 mpg while remaining fully competitivein all market segments and that efforts by GM to restore its market sharein less-fuel-efficient market segments could, consistent with its capacityrestraints, result in a MY 1989 CAFE of 26.5 mpg or below, and concludedthat 26.5 mpg appropriately represents GM's MY 1989 CAFE capability. NHTSA disagrees with the petitioners' argument that the agency did notadequately assess improving fuel economy by use of multi-valve engines.The FRIA discusses multi-valve engines in its section on technology (atp. IV-12). The agency notes that this technology is one of several meansof achieving more efficient fluid flow and combustion in an engine andthat the improvement that can be obtained from this technology is alsoincluded in Table IV-2 of the FRIA under the more general listings of reducedfriction, mechanical and pumping losses. GM's 4-valve-per-cylinder engine, the ``Quad 4,'' is already providingfuel economy gains in the Pontiac Grand Am, Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais,and Buick Skylark. The agency notes that this engine reflects a numberof technology improvements in addition to multi-valve technology. The Quad4 was introduced in MY 1988, and GM noted in an earlier proceeding thatit provides a major advance in fuel economy. With the exception of theMY 1989 Ford Taurus SHO, a lower volume premium performance-oriented car,and the high-performance, low-volume Corvette ZK-1, the Quad 4 is the only4-valve engine offered in domestic cars.The use of the Quad 4 was, of course, reflected in GM's MY 1989 productplan and considered by NHTSA in its evaluation of GM's capability. TheQuad 4 was discussed in several places in the agency's FRIA. With respect to whether GM could make greater use of multi-valve enginesinstead of 6- or 8-cylinder engines during MY 1989, the agency notes thatleadtime constraints prevent use of the Quad 4 in any models beyond thosealready included in GM's plans. For the three models where the Quad 4 isoffered, the vast majority of the cars already use either the Quad 4 ora less expensive (base) 4 cylinder engine. While GM also offers a 6 cylinderoption or turbo 4 cylinder option for these cars, the volumes for theseoptions are sufficiently small that there would be little CAFE impact evenif those engines could be replaced by the Quad 4. NHTSA believes that the Quad 4 represents a significant fuel economy accomplishmentfor GM and considers its development and use to be part of the reasonableefforts made by that company to achieve the statutory 27.5 mpg standard.The agency recognizes that the introduction of a major new engine involvessignificant risks, especially if it incorporates new technologies, andthat a manufacturer typically needs to ensure its acceptability at lowvolumes and with a small number of models prior to expanding its use. Accordingly,the agency does not believe that further use of this engine or technologyfor MY 1989, beyond what GM currently plans, should be expected as partof an asssessment of GM's ``reasonable efforts.'' (A complete discussionof the ``reasonable efforts'' test was provided in the MY 1989 preamble.53 FR 39284-86. 39290-92.) With respect to whether a portion of the decline in GM's projected CAFEfor MY 1989, as compared to MY 1988, appropriately reflected uncertaintyin EPA testing, CFAS/PC asserted that comparison of the 1988 and 1989 EPAtest car lists do not show fuel economy reductions for the same vehiclewhich can be attributed to EPA testing variation. NHTSA notes that a comparisonof the two test car lists shows that of the domestic GM cars that carriedover from MY 1988 to MY 1989 with the same specifications, 17 tests showedlower fuel economy, 16 showed higher fuel economy, and 6 were unchanged.The value of such an exercise is limited, however, since the impact onCAFE depends on the relative production volume of each configuration. NHTSAnotes that it considered this issue during the MY 1989 proceeding (seeFRIA, pp. V-88 to V-89) and does not believe that further evaluation ofthis issue is warranted at this time. <ITAG tagnum="84">GM's Loss in Market Share </ITAG>CFAS/PC's third contention is that NHTSA erroneously concluded that GM'sCAFE of 27.6 mpg in MY 1988 caused it to lose sales. The petitioners assertedthat GM's lower sales in recent years including MY 1988 are due not toCAFE but instead ``to well known GM mistakes including poor quality, failureto differentiate its models in the marketplace, [and] poor styling comparedto its competitors.'' The petitioners are incorrect in asserting that NHTSA concluded that GM'shigh domestic CAFE of 27.6 mpg in MY 1988 <T3>caused</T3> that company to lose domestic sales. The agency did recognizethat GM's achievement of 27.6 mpg in MY 1988 ``can be traced in part toits smaller share of the large car market.'' 53 FR 39277. In making thispoint, the agency stated the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">While the market share loss may have occurred for a variety of reasons,the results were nonetheless dramatic. The decline in market share ledboth to a high CAFE last year and to the laying off thousands of workers,estimated by GM to be a loss of 75,000 workers in the past three years.</ITAG>NHTSA also recognized that ``it is likely that GM plant closings and theother GM product decisions cover the past few years are due in part toovercapacity in the auto industry generally and in part to the market convergingon the medium, `compact' car.'' 53 FR 39278. The agency emphasized, however,that ``the larger car market, while shrinking, is not disappearing in theshort term, and it is clear from Ford's experience that the CAFE of a companythat serves that marget segment will be lower than if the company doesnot serve that market.'' 53 FR 39278. With respect to GM's MY 1989 CAFE capability, the key point is that effortsby that company to regain a portion of its lost market share would comeat a CAFE price. This is particularly true given current consumer demandfor larger engines (in cars of all sizes), and since part of the marketshare lost by GM is in the larger car market, a market segment where thatcompany is traditionally very competitive but which is inherently lessfuel-efficient than other market segments. As NHTSA concluded in the MY1989 proceeding, ``(t)o the extent that GM is able to so accommodate consumerdemand or otherwise increase the sales of its less fuel-efficient vehicles,including less fuel-efficient compacts as well as larger vehicles, itsCAFE will decline, <T3>relative </T3>to what it achieved in MY 1988.'' 53 FR 39290 (emphasisadded). <ITAG tagnum="84">Impact of the Two Fleet Rule </ITAG>CFAS/PC's fourth contention is that NHTSA was incorrect in concluding thatEPCA's requirement that manufacturers separate their fleets into two categories_domesticand not domestically manufactured (i.e., imported)_creates a threat toAmerican jobs. The petitioners asserted that Congress established the twofleet rule to protect domestic jobs and that it does just that if NHTSAdoes not relax CAFE standards. CFAS/PC stated that Congress amended theCAFE law in 1980, at a time well after Japanese imports began capturinga larger market share and started to upscale in the vehicles they wereproducing, and that ``surely'' Congress would have amended this provisionif it were costing U.S. jobs. The petitioners also asserted that UAW PresidentOwen Bieber ``pointed out . . . [that] relaxing CAFE standards costs jobsas it permits the domestic manufacturers to build small cars abroad ratherthan produce them in the U.S.'' NHTSA believes that this issue was fully addressed in the MY 1989 preambleand will not repeat all of that discussion. With respect to Mr. Bieber'scomments, the agency notes that while he did state that ``(t)he loweringof the standards should not provide the companies with an incentive tooutsource smaller vehicles,'' he also urged the agency ``to consider boththe implications of <T3>not </T3>lowering the standards and <T3>of </T3>lowering the standards.'' (Emphasis his.) Mr. Bieber recognizedthat the manufacturers have said that one option for meeting the standardswould be to outsource large vehicles, and expressed concern that ``we arefaced with the threat of outsourcing large cars and the good paying jobsthe manufacture of such vehicles provides for American workers with noimprovements in overall fuel economy or environmental benefits.''NHTSA acknowledges, of course, that the <T3>purpose</T3> of the two fleet rule was to attempt to prevent the fueleconomy program from directly encouraging the importation of small, fuel-efficient,foreign-produced cars. In 1975, when EPCA was passed, the domestic manufacturerswere already importing some fuel-efficient cars, and Congress was concernedthat the manufacturers might decide to meet fuel economy standards largelyby increasing such imports.NHTSA does not agree, however, that the two fleet rule is currently meetingits intended purpose. Today, the domestic manufacturers are importing substantialnumbers of smaller, fuel-efficient cars for reasons unrelated to CAFE.The introduction of low priced, entry-level cars from countries with lowcosts has precluded the domestic manufacturers from competing in this segmentof the market with domestically produced cars. These low-priced modelsare produced in such countries as Korea, Mexico, Brazil and Yugoslavia.This competition has affected import manufacturers as well as domesticmanufacturers. Western European manufacturers have not competed in theAmerican entry-level market for several years, and Japanese manufacturersare now beginning to lose market share to Korean cars. For example, Mitsubishiis now importing a Korean-produced Hyundai as its lowest priced MitsubishiPrecis. Since the domestic manufacturers will necessarily continue to import small,fuel-efficient cars in order to remain in that segment of the market, notwithstandingthe two fleet rule, the current primary effect of the rule is to createan incentive for the domestic manufacturers to transfer the productionof their larger, less fuel-efficient cars to production facilities outsideof the United States, in order to meet CAFE standards. This action wouldresult in a higher domestic CAFE value for these manufacturers, makingit easier for them to meet CAFE standards. and would not create a complianceproblem for the manufacturers' import fleets since the larger, less fuel-efficientcars would be averaged in with the small, more fuel-efficient cars beingimported for competitive reasons. Ford commented in the MY 1988 proceeding,for example, that it could improve its domestic CAFE by 0.6 mpg by sourcingsufficient LTD Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis components outsidethe United States to transfer these vehicles into its import CAFE fleet.While such outsourcing would increase the manufacturers' domestic CAFEvalues, it would reduce the number of American jobs while having no effecton energy conservation. With respect to the petitioners' suggestion that Congress would ``surely''have amended this provision in 1980 if it were costing U.S. jobs, NHTSAobserves that the inability of the domestic manufacturers to compete inthe entry level small car market with domestically produced cars has primarilyoccurred after 1980. For example, GM produced the fuel-efficient Chevettefrom 1975 to 1987. As discussed in the MY 1989 preamble, GM stated at NHTSA'sSeptember 14, 1988 public hearing that the Chevette was not redesignedbecause GM could no longer compete in that market. GM emphasized that itsinability to compete in that market is the reason it is working on Saturnat this point in time, and that it has increased its import fleet fromzero in 1984 to over 300,000 in 1988 to maintain a presence in that marketuntil it can get Saturn on the street. <ITAG tagnum="84">Competitive Impacts </ITAG>CFAS/PC's fifth contention is that NHTSA erroneously concluded that CAFEstandards will result in foreign companies selling more large cars. Thepetitioners argued that the CAFE standards do not give foreign companiesan unfair advantage and that the upscale mid-size and luxury cars beingsold by foreign manufacturers are priced above comparable domestic carsand compete on the basis of quality. NHTSA addressed the issue of competitiveness at considerable length inthe MY 1989 preamble and will not repeat all of that discussion. A portionof the agency's presentation follows (53 FR 39276):<ITAG tagnum="20">. . . (T)he fleet averaging requirement . . . was originally intendedto ensure that manufacturers could continue to offer consumers a wide choiceof makes and models, because compliance with the standard would be measuredon a fleet average basis. In other words, a manufacturer could continueto offer models that achieved fuel economy levels below the standard, aslong as it sold a sufficient number of models that exceeded the standard.While intended as a means to preserve consumer choice, the provision givesa real advantage to Asian and some European manufacturers that generallyhave not been manufacturing large, family-size or luxury vehicles. Thesetting of the standards largely based on the capabilities of the majordomestic manufacturers results in standards that are well below the capabilitiesof these foreign manufacturers, giving them substantial latitude in designingand introducing new models to take advantage of changing consumer preferences.While the full-line U.S. manufacturers must struggle to adjust their fleetmixes to meet the standard on a fleet average basis, these other companiesare manufacturing fleets that are automatically more fuel efficient byvirtue of their sales mix, but not by virtue of any inherent fuel efficiencysuperiority of their individual models. Thus, they need not be concernedwith the adverse CAFE effects of their new, higher performing, less fuel-efficientmodels that the market now demands. And, as discussed below, they are activelyentering the larger and luxury car markets in the U S., posing a real competitivethreat to the U.S. manufacturers in this segment.</ITAG>NHTSA believes that it is obvious that CAFE standards result in unevenimpacts on different manufacturers, depending on the market segments theyserve. Since the Japanese and other Asian manufacturers have traditionallyspecialized in smaller cars and, as a practical matter, are not affectedby the two fleet rule, they can freely introduce new, higher performancelarge or luxury models without fear of CAFE noncompliance. Since GM andFord have traditionally been full-line manufacturers, and cannot averagetogether their most fuel-efficient cars (which are imports) with theirlarger cars, they have lower (domestic) CAFE values than the Japanese andother Asian manufacturers. Thus, overly stringent CAFE standards couldmake it difficult or impossible for GM and Ford to adequately compete withthe new, higher performance large or luxury Japanese models, since suchstandards could constrain the domestic manufacturers from selling competitivemodels. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>After carefully considering the arguments raised by CFAS/PC, NHTSA hasdecided to deny their petition for reconsideration. None of the argumentslead the agency to believe that, on the basis of the record before theagency at the time, it should have declined to exercise its discretionto reduce the MY 1989 passenger car standard, or that the standard shouldhave been set a level other than 26.5 mpg.<ITAG tagnum="20">(15 U.S.C. 2002; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued on May 23, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jeffrey R.
