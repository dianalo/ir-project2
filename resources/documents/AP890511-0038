SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   This just in: The climate of the Earth changeddramatically 20 million years ago when high plateaus rose up inTibet and western North America.   With new threats to the climate looming, upwards of 3,000scientists have gathered here this week for the AmericanGeophysical Union's semiannual exchange of ideas on weather andclimate, volcanoes, earthquakes, water, the solar system and evenpolitics.   Several hundred listeners assembled Wednesday to hear Rep.Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., discuss the need for leadership tocombat the threats of global warming, acid rain and wasteful energypolicies.   ``You don't have to be an alarmist to recognize that if theEarth's average temperature rises as much as five degrees ... itwill completely change our way of life,'' observed Gephardt.   In another hall, William Ruddiman of Columbia University'sLamont-Doherty Geological Observatory explained his calculationshowing that the rise of the mountains in Tibet and western NorthAmerica forced the winds to shift direction around them, causingclimate changes that led to the ice ages.   Scientists have long speculated about the reasons for the iceages. Ruddiman, a marine geologist, and John E. Kutzbach, aclimatologist from the University of Wisconsin, say computerizedmodels of the Earth's climate are convincing them that the risingmountains and high plateaus were the major factor in cooling offNorth America and the northern parts of Europe and Asia.   In addition, they said, those shifts in the wind helped changethe flow of ocean currents and led to conditions that promote thesummer monsoons in Asia, dry summers in California and theMediterranean and increase the cold winter winds in parts of thewestern United States.   A pair of National Aeronautics and Space Administrationscientists, meanwhile, reported their conclusion that the barrageof charged particles from the sun may be contributing to the damageto the Earth's protective ozone layer.   Linwood Callis reported that the flow of high-energy particlesfrom the sun leads to the formation of oxides of nitrogen in theupper parts of the stratosphere.   In turn, those nitrogen compounds can settle into thestratosphere where ``if you have any kind of significant buildup,then what you have is the possibility of catalytic destruction ofozone,'' said Callis.   Ozone helps protect the earth from potentially damagingultraviolet radiation from the sun. Losing some of the ozone couldlead to an increased incidence of skin cancer.   ``What the model calculations show and that the data confirm isthat from 1979 to 1985 the (nitrogen oxide) levels in the polarlower stratosphere probably increased between 30 and 80 or 90percent. In the equatorial region there have been increases, muchsmaller, on the order of 10 or 15 percent,'' Callis said.   Damage to the ozone over the South Pole has been widelydiscussed in recent years. Callis said that so-called Antarctic``ozone hole'' appears to be largely a result of chlorine compoundstrapped over the polar areas, since ice particles in this regiontend to remove many nitrogen compounds from the air.   ``The interest that we have in this is primarily related toglobal ozone ... there are larger than expected ozone changes,''said Callis.   In the air about 16 miles above the surface, the area whereozone is most concentrated, Callis and Dan Baker found the gasdepleted by as much as 14 percent between 1979 and 1985, Callissaid.   Natural changes in the solar cycle should reduce the amount ofincoming charged particles between now and the mid-1990s, saidCallis, and he and Baker are anxious to see if ozone levels willrecover during that period.   While modern and ancient climate changes were under discussion,the massive convention center swarmed with students in jeans,geologists in string ties, nervous speakers rehearsing theirpresentations and political advocates proclaiming the Greenhousewarming a hoax.   A steady drizzle dampened arrivals, while an appropriatelyplaced booth emblazoned ``Hydrology'' greeting them just inside themain entrance.</TEXT></DOC>
