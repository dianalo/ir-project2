The ease of hydrophosphorylation is determinedby the strength of the negative inductive effect of the substituentson the triple bond and the steric factor. The structure of the bis-adductswas confirmed by elementary analysis and the {sup 31}P and {sup 13}CNMR spectra. The {sup 31}P NMR spectrum is an AB two-spin system. Thevalues of the chemical shifts and spin-spin interaction constants {sup3}J/sub PP/ are in agreement with the data in the literature for similarcompounds.</TEXT></DOC>
