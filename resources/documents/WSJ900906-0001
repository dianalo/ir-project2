The catch is that RJR runs the risk of having smokerstrade down from its full-priced brands. Marketing expertswarn that with this campaign, RJR effectively concedes toconsumers that full-cost smokes are overpriced.</LP><TEXT>   The ads, scheduled to begin appearing in magazines and onbillboards early next month, compare Sterling to Benson andamp;Hedges and Virginia Slims, both Philip Morris brands, and toKent, which is made by Lorillard. One billboard ad shows apack of Benson andamp; Hedges on the left with the word &quot;Dollars.&quot;A pack of Sterling appears on the right, next to the word&quot;Sense.&quot; The ads were created by Long, Haymes andamp; Carr.   The ads don't, of course, compare Sterling to RJRNabisco's own regular smokes, like Winston or Camel, butmarketing experts say the Sterling ads will have a negativerub-off on them, too. &quot;This sounds like one more in a longseries of brand introductions where RJR's shooting itself inthe foot,&quot; says Edward Popper, professor of marketing atBryant College in Smithfield, R.I.   Sterling will be priced $3 a carton less than regularcigarettes, which sell for $17 a carton in states likeCalifornia and Texas; in other states like New York, theprice is somewhat higher.   Originally, when tobacco makers concocted discount smokes,the idea was that they would be barely advertised. Instead,they would be simply thrown out to retailers to satisfy asmall niche of consumers so price-sensitive that they wouldrather quit than pay for brand imagery. Recent ads havecelebrated the value of discount smokes, but mostly haven'tmentioned full-priced rivals.   But with the big success of discount brands like Liggett'sPyramid, which entered the market in early 1989, othercigarette makers have scrambled to get a piece of the action.Suddenly, the market is glutted with cheap brands, and adspending has grown apace.   If Sterling is the latest good news for consumers, itposes risks for RJR. Industry insiders privately expressshock that RJR is almost going out of its way to imperil thefuture of its core brands, which are far more profitable thanthe cheapie smokes, for the sake of a short-term sales hit.Once consumers are taught to buy on price, not image, there'sno going back, these sources say.   &quot;RJR is telling consumers not to buy on the basis ofimage, but to buy on the basis of dollars,&quot; Mr. Popper says.   RJR says it knows the risks of the campaign. But theWinston-Salem, N.C., tobacco maker says it has taken greatpains to make Sterling a quality smoke that will createbrand-loyal consumers. And the company plays down the hazardsof cannibalizing its own full-price brands.   &quot;Anytime you bring a new product into a static market, youhave to draw the business from somebody else,&quot; an RJR Nabiscospokeswoman says. &quot;Granted, part of that is probably going tocome from your existing stable of brands.&quot; But she stressesthat RJR research shows that 70% of Sterling's smokers willcome from people who are now smoking a non-RJR brand.   With Sterling, RJR seemingly has borrowed a page fromLiggett's marketing plan for Pyramid, which also usescomparative advertising. &quot;They're even more impressive whenyou discover they cost 40% less than Winston,&quot; one Pyramid adsays. (Since Liggett commands only a tiny share of thefull-price cigarette market, its decision to use thehigh-risk comparison strategy makes good sense.)   Another potential problem facing Sterling is that, despiteits boastful advertising, it simply isn't the best dealgoing. Although it's about $3 a carton cheaper than regularcigarettes, the &quot;sub-generics&quot; like Pyramid and AmericanBrands' Montclair brand are some $5 dollars cheaper.   Larry Turner, a stockbroker in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, says itdoesn't appear to him that RJR is offering much of anincentive for smokers to switch to Sterling. Just last month,after 22 years of smoking Winston, he and his wife bothswitched to Montclair. &quot;I'm not too excited about tryingSterling if it's $2 {a carton} higher than Montclair,&quot; hesays. &quot;There's no reason to.&quot;   ---   Mattel Reviews Europe                                                                                                          Mattel has put its European advertising account up forreview. Currently, J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy andamp; Mather,both units of WPP Group, are the giant toy maker's majoragencies in Europe. Billings on the account couldn't belearned.   A Mattel spokesman confirmed the review and said it plansa decision this fall. The spokesman declined to say whatprompted the review, but industry aides cited the arrival ofa new top international executive as one reason.   It isn't clear what agencies will be involved in thereview.   Mattel's U.S. account, which is split between Ogilvy andFoote, Cone andamp; Belding, isn't affected by the review.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
