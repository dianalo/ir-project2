(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some call him ``Maximum Bob,'' but JudgeRobert Potter isn't always as harsh as his early handling of the PTLtrial might indicate, according to lawyers who have watched him foryears.   Potter is presiding at the federal fraud trial of PTL founder JimBakker, who is accused of diverting more than $3.7 million inministry money to fund his lavish lifestyle.   The trial, which opened three weeks ago, was to resume today.   On the trial's first day, Potter repeatedly scolded defenseattorney George T. Davis. On Sept. 6, he ruled that Bakker wascompetent to stand trial, despite a panic attack in which Bakkersaid he thought he was under attack by wild animals. Two days later,Potter sentenced former Bakker aide David Taggart to the harshestprison term allowed by law.   But lawyers who have watched Potter during his eight years on thebench say he's not a cruel man, despite the moniker that refers toPotter's sentencing practices.   ``He can be harsh when it's called for,'' said Charlotte lawyerGeorge Laughrun, ``but compassionate when it's justified.''   If a defendant is guilty and admits it, Potter is likely to weighthat on the defendant's behalf during sentencing, he said. If hethinks a defendant is lying, he's likely to weigh it against him.   Before he sentenced Taggart and his brother for tax evasion,Potter said he thought they lied on the witness stand. He sentencedDavid Taggart to 18 years and five months in prison, and JamesTaggart to 17 years, nine months.   But Potter sentenced former PTL executive Richard Dortch to eightyears, out of a possible 10, after Dortch pleaded guilty,apologized, and agreed to testify for the government.   Potter's average prison sentence of 7.4 years in 1986 was 1{times the national average, The Charlotte Observer reported Sunday.   He has been particularly harsh on white-collar criminals and drugoffenders _ his average drug sentence of 10.6 years was twice thenational average in 1986, according to the newspaper.   ``There's no question he deals sternly with those crimes that hebelieves have a harder impact on the community, and that's alwaysbeen his trait,'' said Ken Andresen, a former federal prosecutor nowin private practice in Charlotte. ``But across the board, to callhim `Maximum Bob,' I don't agree with that. In other cases, he hasdealt leniently.''   In 1985, Potter gave a break to a former state trooper who robbeda Federal Armored Express truck of more than $250,000. The man, analcoholic with financial troubles, had no prior convictions and agood law enforcement record. Potter gave him a suspended sentenceand a $1,000 fine.   As an attorney, Potter worked in the 1970s and early 1980s in thecampaigns of Sen. Jesse Helms and Ronald Reagan. In 1981 Reagan, atHelms' urging, appointed him to the bench.   ``I've appeared in front of him for civil jury trials, and I'vecome away feeling that Judge Potter was evenhanded and fair, and hekept the trial moving right along,'' said civil rights attorney JohnGresham.</TEXT></DOC>
