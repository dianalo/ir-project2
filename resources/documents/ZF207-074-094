althoughall parties were keeping a discreet silence on the announcement, weunderstand that the companies will introduce a cut price software package for80386-based systems, including SCO Xenix with PC Interface from Locus, theIngres database, the OSF Motif user interface and X-Windows along with DEC'sX toolkit, all packaged and distributed by Santa Cruz and costing less thanIngres on its own; although the price we had heard - $995 - was the onlyaspect of the announcement that no-one would confirm: the package ispresumably aimed at those who would otherwise consider OS/2, and will beoffered - though not exclusively - on Tandy micros, which DEC also takes andre-badges.andM;IBM Corp's Gerry Lautenbach is the keynote speaker at the conference thisyear, and he will be followed on the Wednesday morning by ATandamp;T Data SystemsGroup chief Robert Kavner - and there is gossip suggesting that Open SoftwareFoundation chief David Tory might speak on the third morning of the show.andM;IBM was keeping very tight-lipped about its plans for UniForum as we went topress yesterday, although it looked increasingly unlikely that the expectedpower boost for the RT workstation would be among the announcements - despitethe ideal opportunity the show would afford: other announcements we mightlook for include more details on what IBM plans for the NeXT Inc NeXTStepgraphical user interface, and news on its database for the RT.andM;ATandamp;T Co has some new hardware waiting in the wings, which should be announced&quot;within a month&quot; according to industry sources - but it is not expected toshow up this week.andM;And along with its Open Look and Secure Unix announcements at UniForum thisweek, ATandamp;T Co is also launching its System V Application Verifier, fortesting the conformance of applications to the System V Interface Definition,and a multinational language supplement for the Release 3.2 of Unix System V.andM;What of IBM's new &quot;advanced&quot; version of AIX?andP;  The Open Software Foundationhas said that it expects to have seleable code of its own version of AIX assoon as this June - but that requires IBM to be ready.andM;UniForum attendees will have a chance to see the much hyped NeXT computersystem on Relational Technology Inc's stand, where it will be running theNeXTStep windowing package acting as a front end to the Ingres relationaldatabase: Ingres versions for the NeXT computer, and for the recentlyannounced MIPS Computer Systems Inc RISC-based DECstation 3100, will be outin the second quarter of the year.andM;The show-wide vendor network installed around San-Francisco's Moscone Centerfor UniForum this year has a 10Mbps twisted pair backbone, externalconnections to Arpanet and NSFnet, and TCP/IP-based network management:installed by Hewlett-Packard Co and Cisco Systems Inc, Menlo Park,California, the network will have an operations center which will showavailable wiring and connections, and also demonstrate the various directory,mail and network services provided.andM;Text retrieval specialist Fulcrum Technologies Inc has introduced a newclient-server distributed processing architecture version of its Ful/Textpackage, which supports remote searching of document collections across localand wide area networks: Ful/Text runs on a variety of MS-DOS and Unix-basedsystems, and is a free form, full text retrieval system popular amongstcommercial software developers wanting to include text retrieval facilitieswithin their packages - Hewlett-Packard Co, Data General Corp, Siemens AG,Nixdorf Computer, Philips International BV and ICL are amongst the Ottawa,Canada-based company's OEM customers.andM;Quicksilver for Unix, said to be the world's first dBase language compilerfor Unix environments, will be demonstrated at UniForum running underInteractive Systems Corp's 386/ix - Quicksilver adds windows, graphics, and arange of other functions to the Ashton-Tate Corp version of the dBaselanguage while remaining file and syntax compatible with dBase III Plus:Orinda, California-based WordTech Systems, which introduced its first dBasecompiler back in 1984, says it is currently working on versions for SantaCruz Operation Xenix and other Unix versions, and will start shipping in thesecond quarter.andM;Abraxus Software Inc, from Lincoln, California, will be showing its Athenawholesale distribution and accounting system at UniForum, which was writtenusing the Accell applications generator from Unify Corp - but in case theattractions of such a system are not sufficient to draw huge crowds to itsstand, it is also offering a trip for two to Athens, drawing a the winner'sname from the business cards of attendees who stop by and agree to see ademonstration of the product.andM;ATandamp;T Co says it has &quot;updated&quot; Unix System V/386 Release 3.2 to includesupport for Locus Computing Corp's MS-DOS-under-Unix package Merge 386, andhas added system and Remote File System administration facilities, sourcecode for AT and Multibus I and II drivers, as well as for additional graphicsboards.andM;Prime Computer Inc has signed to offer Apollo Computer Inc's NetworkComputing System on its EXL family of 80386-based Unix supermicros.andM;Glendale, California-based software house MCBA Inc has completed itsambitious 19-module MCBA Classic manufacturing software system for Unix-basedcomputers with the launch of the final package - Capacity RequirementsPlanning: the full system runs on NCR.andP;  Compaq and Altos hardware usingMotorola 680X0 or Intel 80X86 processors, and is deemed suitable for small tomedium-sized jobs shops as well as discrete repetitive manufacturers.andM;Last night, on the eve of the show.andP;  Intel Corp was due to reveal marketingand sampling information on its N-10 RISC processor - there's an announcementhere today, and as well as providing a name for the highly integrated, part64-bit, 50 MIPS chip, Intel will presumably explain where it will target it:all the major workstation vendors have now chosen their next generation CPUs,leaving only a few of the proprietary minimakers still looking for an entryinto high performance Unix markets, and only the news that IBM and AppleComputer have been sampling the chip puts future market share predictions ona more optimistic footing; it has been suggested that IBM could use the chipfor future  generations of the RT, although that would mean IBM abandoningdevelopment work on its own ROMP RISC.andM;Many in the Unix industry had hoped that ATandamp;T Co and the Open SoftwareFoundation would have patched up their differences at last year's UniForumshow in Dallas, Texas, but here we are, one year on with two sharplypolarised industry groups: even so we hear there were moves afoot before theshow to attempt some sort of reconciliation between Unix International andthe Foundation, centered around the common link of X/Open Group Ltd, and thatat one stage a press conference on an agreement was pencilled in forWednesday afternoon.andM;Meanwhile the Open Software Foundation has apparently considered taking outfull X/Open membership, saying that it is entitled to do so as a softwaredeveloper (implying that the rival Unix International would not be eligible):both groups are working to implement X/Open's Common ApplicationsEnvironment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
