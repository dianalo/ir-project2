The index of leading indicators, the government's main economic forecasting tool, probably slipped in December. That would mark two consecutive declines -- one dip short of the three in a row that prompt recession worries. A rule of thumb for economists is that three consecutive months of decline presage a recession.    But a fact of life is that the index is an amalgam of mostly already-reported statistics, and an imperfect one at that.    &quot;If the index declines, the leading indicators could create a lot of hoopla,&quot; Robert Gay, senior economist at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., says. But he and other economists are more interested in the unemployment rate, because &quot;it tells you what's going on with hiring -- people don't hire unless they've got something to produce,&quot; Mr. Gay says. Because much of the recent economic momentum has come from nuts-and-bolts industry, manufacturers' workforce plans are particularly significant. Mr. Gay figures the civilian unemployment rate reached 5.9% in December, slightly higher than in the previous month, reflecting the jump in weekly initial unemployment claims. As previously reported, those jobless claims, for the week ended Jan. 16, rose to the highest level in a year.    As for the index of leading indicators, economists expect a decline ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 percentage point, reflecting an economy that has chugged along mainly in industries that produce for export, while chilling in the financial services fields. Strength in a few of the index's 11 components -- notably the hefty durable goods orders reported last week -- probably was offset by weakness in stock prices, sensitive raw materials and building permits.    &quot;The leading indicators have seen their day,&quot; Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., says. &quot;The unemployment and payroll survey numbers are going to be key.&quot;    &quot;I think we're within a couple of months of cutbacks in payroll, based on the fact that the consumer sector is clearly weakening and on the fact that inventories are clearly excessive,&quot; Mr. Straszheim says. &quot;Companies will respond to that with cutbacks in output and employment.&quot; The problem is that much of the recent production appears to have just piled up in inventory.    Strength in the manufacturing sector &quot;has showed up in the unemployment figures already and might show up in January&quot; to help the rate, says Geoffrey Moore, director of the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University.    Still, Morgan Stanley's Mr. Gay figures the unemployment rate may have edged up slightly, reflecting an ebbing of those job gains, as well as stabilization of the expansion in the service sector. The economists caution that January employment figures can be sticky, because of seasonal employment patterns following Christmas hiring.    Economists are sticking to predictions of slow going for the economy in the first half.    High inventory levels reported last week also make Kathleen Cooper, chief economist at Security Pacific National Bank, Los Angeles, more sure of a slowing. &quot;It made me a little more nervous that the first quarter may be weaker than anticipated,&quot; she says.    Many economists stop short of predicting a recession, though they admit to being more worried.    Richard Peterson, chief economist at Continental Illinois National Bank in Chicago, says: &quot;What we're seeing is a very minor inventory cycle. The buildup isn't at the manufacturing level, it's at the trade level, both wholesale and retail.&quot; He notes inventories grew in the fourth quarter, as domestic production stayed high while imports also were strong.    On the home front, December sales of existing homes, reported last week, fell 3.8%-the second consecutive monthly drop. This week's December tally of new home sales also is expected to be down.    James Christian, chief economist at the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, expects new-home sales of about 650,000 units, well under the previous 11-month average of 685,000. &quot;Consumers just said 'Bye-bye' in the fourth quarter,&quot; Mr. Christian says.    With the Midwest getting a boost from exports and the East suffering a decline in financial services, the geographic composition of new-home sales may be in for a change, he says.    &quot;It will take us well into the spring to see what shift in the GNP will cause in housing,&quot; he adds.    ---                   The Economy in Numbers            Statistics Released in the Past Week                                                CHANGE                                                (from prior                                     TOTAL      period) Real GNP 4th quarter preliminary (in trillions) .................... $3.875     + 4.2% M1 Money Supply Week to Jan. 18 (in billions) ..................... $761.5     + .004% Domestic car sales (Jan. 11-20) ...................... 186,385    + 31.7% Personal income Dec. annual rate (in trillions) .................... $3.865     +  0.7% Personal consumption Dec. annual rate (in trillions) .................... $3.031     +  0.5% Durable goods orders Dec.
