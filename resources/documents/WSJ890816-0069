Tired of pedestrian insults heard on the street, members of the Jane Austen Society of North America recently trooped to the New York Botanical Gardens to sling some more refined dirt.    To be sure, the cultivated yet caustic remarks at the gathering weren't original. Instead, the insulters preferred to bow to past masters of the put-down, flinging barbs that, while witty, were definite hand-me-downs.    The members took their theme from the Box Hill picnic scene in Jane Austen's &quot;Emma.&quot; They took turns reading from the chapter, in which Emma asks picnic participants to say either one brilliant thing, two moderately amusing things, or three dull things. Emma then delivered a barb to the elderly, notoriously wordy Miss Bates:    &quot;Pardon me -- but you will be limited as to number -- only three at once.&quot;    In the novel, Emma is taken to task for the insult, but society members appear to like her all the more for it.    Among the ripostes they repeated was Samuel Johnson's daunting reply to an aspiring author: &quot;Sir. Your manuscript is both good and original. But the part that is good is not original, and the part that is original is not good.&quot;    Gladstone to Disraeli: &quot;You, sir, shall either die by hanging or from some loathsome disease.&quot; To which Disraeli replied: &quot;The former, sir, only if I embrace your politics; the latter if I embrace your mistress.&quot;    &quot;Janites,&quot; the name Rudyard Kipling gave Jane Austen fanatics, say their favorite author is an oasis amid the upsets of late 20th-century life.    &quot;We are all seekers of civilized life,&quot; says Jeanne Kiefer, picnic coordinator.    &quot;She is the Garden of Eden, and there is no devil,&quot; says Sedell Rand, a longtime Jane fan.    The gatherers pointed out that Jane herself wasn't malicious in her writing. &quot;While the insults we read may be abrasive and harsh, this was never her way,&quot; says Marian Attarian Bryer.    Still, they seemed to enjoy flinging a few good ones. In fact, they allowed themselves three comments each -- which makes one wonder in which category Emma would have placed the witticisms. </TEXT></DOC>
