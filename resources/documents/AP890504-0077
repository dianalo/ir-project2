Border security has been tightened in south Texas by theImmigration and Naturalization Service, INS officials say. Inaddition, Mexican authorities have arrested 13,000 Central Americanrefugees in the last six months, up from 12,000 the prevous year,the INS says.   James L. Buck, deputy immigration commissioner, told reportersWednesday that Mexico has reinstituted checkpoints along thatcountry's southern border and authorities are randomly stoppingmotorists to spot illegal aliens.   Buck noted that the number of border arrests of illegal aliensin south Texas has dropped from 200 to 300 a day to about 50 dailysince a 400-member INS task force was assigned to Port Isabel,Texas, on Feb. 21.   The task force was set up to help stop the explosion ofpolitical asylum applications from Central Americans at the border.Between June and December of last year the INS was receiving anaverage of 5,000 asylum applications a month.   Most of the refugees were not eligible for political asylumbecause they couldn't satisfy the INS requirement that theydemonstrate a well-based fear of persecution.   As many as 2,500 were detained at the Port Isabel facility,which now holds 1,500 aliens awaiting adjudication of their asylumclaims. Another 1,700 have been deported, INS officials say.   The number of asylum applications submitted at the border hasalso dropped from 200 daily to only a handful, Buck said.   If current trends continue, ``probably by the end of the summer,we will begin to see this entire task force sized downsignificantly,'' Buck said.   INS Commissioner Alan Nelson said INS has received JusticeDepartment clearance to begin deportation of 100 Nicaraguans whowere denied political asylum.   Under an attorney general's order, Nicaraguan refugees whoseasylum applications are rejected at INS are screened by a JusticeDepartment unit before deportation proceedings are instituted.   Nelson said about 16 percent of Nicaraguans seeking asylum havereceived it, compared to 4 percent from El Salvador.   Nelson, meanwhile, credited the employer sanction provisions ofthe 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act with helping to reducethe overall number of arrests along the 1,000-mile U.S.-Mexicanborder.   The INS has assessed $7 million in fines to employers accused ofhiring illegal aliens and collected $1.6 million, Nelson said.   Nelson noted INS and Border Patrol agents arrested 1.6 millionillegal aliens in 1986, the year before the immigration law wasenacted. Since then the yearly totals have declined significantly,he said.   In the first six months of the 1989 fiscal year, arrests weredown about a third from 1988, when the total for 12 months was940,670, Nelson said.   The trend ``continues to demonstrate that the law is working,''Nelson said.   Under the one-year amnesty program for once-illegal aliens, theINS is gearing up to process nearly 3.1 million requests fromforeigners to become permanent U.S. residents.   The application deadline for amnesty was a year ago today. Sincethen the INS has approved nearly 1.8 million applications fortemporary residency, while denying about 70,000.   It continues to process the balance of the applications fortemporary residence.   Aliens may apply for permanent residency 18 months after beinggiven legal status. They must apply for permanent residency withina year of becoming eligible for face deportation.   Advocacy groups contend the INS isn't doing enough to spread theword about the impending deadlines.   But INS officials say 60 percent of those who are now eligibleto apply have done so and they expect the application rate to reach97 percent by the time the program ends.   Nelson said the agency has received 290,000 applications so far.   INS officials say computerized mailings make advertisingcampaigns unnecessary because ``we are reaching out directly tothese people,'' said Richard Norton, associate commissioner forexaminations.</TEXT></DOC>
