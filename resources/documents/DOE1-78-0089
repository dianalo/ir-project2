When the annular widths are smaller than{lambda}/sub J/, analytic solutions of magnetic field dependence of themaximum Josephson current l/sub m/ are obtained. Because the externalmagnetic field is nonuniform distributed in the junctions, the minimaof l/sub m/ are not equal to zero. These results exhibit a quasi-diffractioncharacteristic. When the annular widths are larger than {lambda}/subJ/, the numerical solutions of the self-field equations are obtained,which show the magnetic field dependence of the maximum Josephson currentl/sub m/ and the current distribution. Due to the 2-dimensional character,the points of maximum of l/sub m/ are not on the axis where the externalfield is equal to zero in the plot of l/sub m/ vs. l/sub H/.</TEXT></DOC>
