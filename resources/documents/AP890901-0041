The new deadline for implementing the so-called Section 89 rulesis Dec. 1, the IRS said Thursday.   Legislation enacted in 1986 requires employers to demonstratethat health and accident plans and group life insurance do not favorhigher-paid workers. The original deadline of Jan. 1, 1989, had beendelayed until Oct. 1.   Business groups have lobbied to have the rule dropped altogether,arguing that it is so complex, costly and time consuming that itwill drive some small companies out of business.   They claim the rule is having the opposite effect intendedbecause companies are dropping benefits rather than extend them toall workers.   Several measures affecting Section 89 are pending in Congress.</TEXT><NOTE>New Hearing Set for Poindexter in Iran-Contra Case</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A hearing will be held next week to determinewhether Iran-Contra figure John M. Poindexter may introduce evidencethat covert aid to Nicaraguan rebels was legal.   A federal judge Thursday scheduled a Sept. 6 hearing to discusswhether there was valid evidence that the former national securityadviser could use to defend the charge that he obstructedcongressional inquiries into whether National Security Council aideOliver L. North was secretly helping arm the Nicaraguan Contras.   Poindexter is accused of obstructing Congress in August 1986 byassuring three House committees that the National Security Councilwas observing ``the spirit as well as the letter'' of a ban on U.S.military assistance to the anti-Sandinista rebels.   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene said he wanted to determine ifPoindexter should be given a chance to prove he had no motive toconceal North's activities by showing they were ``legal, authorized,or known throughout the government.''   At issue is whether any knowledge of the activities by PresidentReagan or other government officials could be presented as evidencethat Poindexter thought the National Security Council was followingthe law.</TEXT><NOTE>NASA Selects Schools for Space Study Grants</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA has selected 17 universities or universitygroups to participate in its new National Space Grant College andFellowship program.
