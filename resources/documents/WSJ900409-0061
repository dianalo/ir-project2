The optimistic estimate was made by James Cannavino, IBM'sgeneral manager of personal systems, in an annual backgroundsession for securities analysts here.

IBM's U.S. market share forworkstations during 1989 was minuscule, only about 2%, butthe company recently unveiled a hot new line called the RISCSystem/6000, which should boost that number in 1990. Noreliable figures are available for IBM's world-wide marketshare.
