(synchronous optical network standard)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Sweeney, Terry.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The future of the synchronous optical network standard, or Sonet,is being questioned by potential users.andP;  The main problem is thatit is regarded as a carrier medium which will expand transmissionspeed and bandwidth but have little applicability to the needs ofthe user.andP;  Upon implementation, Sonet will provide standardizationfor transmission speeds of 51.84M-bps to 13G-bps on fiber opticnetworks.andP;  But it can also eliminate multiplexing at each centraloffice in the network.andP;  In addition to faster transmission, Sonetcan make a network more efficient by allowing the equipment ofmultiple vendors to be utilized anywhere along the fiber opticspan.andP;  It can provide a platform for the implementation ofbroadband ISDN services.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     SONET (Computer Network Protocol)StandardsFiber OpticsNetwork ManagementOptical CommunicationsTransmission SpeedUser Needs.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
