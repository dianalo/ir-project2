What's apresident to do?   If the president stands firm and waits for lower interestrates to spark recovery, the wait may be long. Conversely,efforts to jump-start the economy with accelerated spendingprograms or tax cuts will break the Budget Agreement, at atime when budget deficits are already huge.</LP><TEXT>   There is a way, however, to stimulate the economysignificantly in the &quot;pay as you go&quot; spirit of the BudgetAgreement. The goal is a bold, targeted program to restorereal estate values, thereby restarting America's economicengine through increased consumer and investor confidence. Acompelling motivation for the initiative-and a possiblesource of fundingcomes from reducing the fastest-growing itemin the budget: the bailout of the thrift and bankingindustries.   In fiscal 1991, deposit insurance outlays to bail outfailed savings and loans were $66.6 billion, up from $10billion three years ago. That figure is expected to rise to$100 billion or more in 1992. Additional outlays in futureyears could total as much as $80 billion, depending on howmuch the Resolution Trust Corporation can get from sellingthe real estate assets of failed thrifts. Add to that thepotential conversion into actual outlays of the $70 billion&quot;loan&quot; to the Bank Insurance Fund so it can repay depositorsof failed banks, and there's more than $250 billion in futureoutlays in prospect just to pay off depositors of federallyinsured banks and thrifts.   This is the only expense line in the federal budget thatis both huge and unpopular -- everyone would like to see itfall to zero. Let's use this money in a more constructiveway. Here's how.   What's driving up the cost of deposit insurance bailoutsis the continuing credit crunch for real estate. In manyareas, real estate is in a depression. Values of land andbuildings -- $10.7 trillion at the end of 1990 -- continue toweaken. Lower real estate values do more than reducehousehold and business net worth (whether in perception orreality); they also erode the value of loans and securitiescollateralized by real estate, which represent about 30% ofbank, insurance and other financial institution portfolios.   Banks and thrifts then become insolvent, forcing taxpayerbailouts of depositors. This gives the government moredistressed properties to sell, which further depressesproperty prices. When sales of this real estate bring inlower-than-expected prices, deposit insurance outlays riseand the vicious cycle continues.   No country can be financially strong with its real estatebase in disarray. The real estate industry has pointed thisout, but its arguments have been seen as parochial. They aremuch more than that.   -- Real estate assets account for a third of household networth. Soft home values have restrained consumer spending,especially at a time when consumer debt is high (mortgagedebt as a percent of owner-occupied housing climbed to 58% in1990, from 50% in 1989). Furthermore, 1990 was only thesecond year since World War II when aggregate personal networth in homes declined. With commercial real estate valuestumbling, consumer fears of falling home values are growing.No wonder consumers are scared and consumer confidence islow.   -- Commercial real estate alone contributes about 23% ofall taxes paid in this country, and more than 70% of alllocal taxes collected. So, depressed property values and realestate activity reduce revenues for many cities, forcing themto raise other taxes, or else close parks, hospitals orschools.   -- Every economic recovery in the postwar period has begunwith real estate: people buying new or bigger houses, orbusinesses investing in new office or factory construction asinterest rates come down. While residential housing andconstruction have been picking up, the recovery has not beenstrong, even with the lowest mortgage rates in years.   The death march of real estate must be stopped before itseffects on the rest of the economy get even worse. Otherwise,falling real estate values will trigger more failures bythrifts, banks and insurance companies (which nowincreasingly feel these trends); federal spending on thriftand bank bailouts will go up another notch, increasing thebudget deficit and interest rates; more forced property saleswill undercut asset values, causing new problems for ownersand lenders; declining real estate prices will further erodeconsumer confidence, and deepen the crisis for state andlocal governments; reduced demand, higher taxes, and cutbacksin public services will then weaken real estate values. Andso on.   To stop the real estate crunch, we must address itscauses. One cause was the interplay between the 1981 and 1986tax acts. The 1981 act created excessive incentives thatcontributed to commercial overbuilding. But the 1986 actovershot and knocked the props out of real estate prices bytaking risk capital out of the industry. Another cause wasover-aggressive lending, aided by inadequate regulation,which helped fund a run-up in prices and overcapacity incommercial real estate.   What's the cure? Where can the money come from? How can itbe done without making the budget deficit worse? The answeris a comprehensive program to stabilize real estate valuesand thus avoid the &quot;needless costs&quot; of the present open-endeddeposit insurance bailout. That's the missing conceptuallink. If real estate prices stabilize and improve, fewerbanks and thrifts will fail, and their depositors won't needto be bailed out in the first place.   In short, a bold and comprehensive program aimed atinducing investment in real estate is in order. What's neededis a combination of lower interest rates, regulatory policiesthat allow sound real estate financing, and a federal taxprogram aimed at stabilizing and restoring commercial andresidential real estate values.   First, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Departmentshould work to lower interest rates even further,particularly long-term rates. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspanheld out the promise of lower rates in his testimony beforethe House Ways and Means Committee Wednesday.   Second, the Federal Reserve and other financial regulatorsshould send clear signals that lenders who continue tofinance or refinance sound real estate investment will not bepenalized.   Third, Congress should quickly adopt a targeted realestate tax program to address current cash-flow problemsfacing the industry, for example by restoring some form ofpassive loss treatment (at a minimum for actual economiccosts), cutting the capital gains tax on real estate, andexpanding incentives for low-income housing. For commercialreal estate, where a supply glut exists, this program shouldfavor existing properties. For residential real estate,coverage could include sound new construction -- especiallyfor low- and middle-income families -- as well as existingproperty. Federal targeting could be supplemented at thestate and local levels.   If the tailspin in real estate were arrested and valuesstabilized, the dominolike effects of depressed real estateprices on the economy could be stopped. Consumer and businessconfidence would improve, as would the health of our moneyand capital markets. Using the discipline of &quot;pay as you go,&quot;the budgetary cost of the tax program could be at leastpartly, if not fully, offset through lower future outlays fordeposit insurance bailouts, because better real estate priceswould mean fewer bank and thrift failures.   The impact of this program would be significant, and itsbenefits for the economy enormous. This would be a standaloneinitiative; other debates on tax policy, the defense budget,health-care costs, etc., can continue as separate issues, tostand or fall on their own merits.   Real estate values have an impact on every community.Reasonable prices and rents are part of low inflation-but novalues, no buyers, no investors, and no building is theframework for a major recession or worse. Let's act now,before the first quarter of 1992 passes.   ---   Mr. Freedman is chairman of Coopers andamp; Lybrand.
