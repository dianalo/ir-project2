Inflation, which has been at or below 4 percent for the past sixyears, is being pushed higher by price pressures caused by tightlabor markets, high factory operating rates and a weak dollar,analysts said.   The April price increase followed a 0.5 percent March advance,which had been the sharpest monthly gain since January 1987.Analysts said the uptick in inflation over the past two months isworrisome because it reflected price increases in a variety ofareas.   In April, grocery store prices shot up 0.8 percent, the biggestincrease in 20 months, while gasoline costs, which had fallen fromSeptember though February, jumped 1.1 percent.   Clothing costs, which had surged a record 2 percent in March,posted another 2 percent rise in April, reflecting higher costs ofimports.   ``We have an unacceptably high rate of inflation that iswidespread,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.``This is the consequence of both the strength in the economy andthe effect of the weaker dollar on imported goods prices.''   Seven months after the October stock market crash raised fearsof a recession, analysts have now switched to worrying that theeconomy is growing so strongly that inflationary pressures arebuilding. They cite the fact that factories are now operating atthe highest level in eight years while unemployment has fallen to a14-year-low of 5.4 percent.   The Federal Reserve already has boosted interest rates twice inthe past two months in an effort to dampen demand and head offfurther inflationary pressures.   But the tightening has done little to reassure financialmarkets, which have been in a tailspin in recent days, driven downnot only by inflation concerns but fears that interest rates willgo higher.   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 6.13 to close at1,952.59, bringing the loss for the week to 37.95 points asconcerns about inflation and higher interest rates continued todominate the market.   Top Reagan administration officials, including TreasurySecretary James A. Baker III, have contended the market'sinflationary fears are overblown.   In a statement Friday, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwatersaid ``inflation remains under control'' with no significantacceleration from recent years.   But private economists disagreed. David Jones, an economist withAubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co., a government securities dealer, predictedconsumer prices would rise by 5.5 percent this year. That would bethe fastest inflation rate since 1981 and up substantially from the4.4 percent increase in 1987.   ``The fears that people have had about higher inflation arejustified,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch.``The general message in this report is that prices have beenrising in the past two months at a faster pace and they willcontinue to do so.''   Steinberg said the Fed will be forced to keep pushing interestrates higher to fight rising inflationary pressures and that thiseventually will lead to a recession sometime next year. But othereconomists said it was too soon to predict a recession from theupturn in inflation.   The Labor Department gave these details of its Consumer PriceIndex for April:   _More than one-fourth of the monthly increase came from the 2percent rise in clothing costs, paced by a 3.5 percent jump inwomen's apparel, a 2.7 percent rise in the prices for children'sgoods and a 2.1 percent increase in men's clothing.   _The 0.8 percent rise in grocery store prices, the biggest sinceAugust 1986, reflected higher prices for beef (up 2.3 percent),fish (up 2.9 percent) and fruits and vegetables (up 1.4 percent).The higher food costs contributed another one-fourth of the overallprice increase in April.   _In addition to the 1.1 percent rise in gasoline prices, homeheating oil rose 0.9 percent and natural gas and electricity costswere up 0.4 percent. Some analysts predicted further gasoline priceincreases in May, but they said prices should moderate after thatbecause of the failure of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries to reach agreement with non-member nations to limitproduction.   _New car prices were unchanged in April, but the cost of publictransportation jumped 0.8 percent, reflecting higher airline ticketprices.   The various increases left the consumer price index at 117.1,meaning a market basket of consumer goods costing $10.00 on averagebetween 1982 and 1984, cost $11.71 last month.   The Labor Department said in another report Friday thatAmericans' average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation,rose 0.9 percent in April as the 0.4 percent rise in inflation wasoffset by increases in hourly pay and number of hours worked.   The changes left Americans' inflation-adjusted earnings 0.3percent above a year ago.   In other economic news Friday:   _Income tax collections helped shrink the federal budget deficitby $13.9 billion in April, but the deficit for the first sevenmonths of the fiscal year, $105.0 billion, was running 24.6 percentahead of last year. Economists said the Reagan administration wouldhave difficulty meeting its deficit projection for 1988 of $146.7billion.   _The Veterans Administration announced that effective Monday itwas increasing the maximum interest rate on federally-backed VAhome mortgages by 0.5 percentage points to 10.5 percent.   _Average rates on 30-year, fixed-rate conventional mortgagesincreased to 10.52 percent this week, up from 10.40 percent lastweek, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said.</TEXT></DOC>
