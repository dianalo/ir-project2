These changes are too numerous to detailhere. All interested parties are encouraged to study the appendix, whichcontains all the proposed changes, and compare them to the current rules.We will highlight some of the more significant changes.Part 1136 requires that rail and motor carriers give advance notice andjustification for commutation or suburban passenger fare increases. Noticeto the public of such increases is already required by 49 CFR 1312.5(c)The Commission may not investigate, suspend, revise, or revoke a rate proposedby a motor passenger common carrier, acting independently, on the groundthat such rate is unreasonable. 49 U.S.C. 10708(e). However, the Commission,on complaint, may review rates established by independent action. <T3>Procedures_Complaints Against Bus Car. Rate andamp; Fares,</T3> 133 M.C.C.240 (1983); 49 CFR part 1142. An independently established motor passengercarrier rate may become effective after only 1 day's notice. 49 CFR 1312.39(i)Independently established passenger carrier rates (motor and rail) havebeen challenged on only three occasions during the last 5 years (none onthe motor side). Similarly, there have been no complaints or protests stemmingfrom collective ratemaking activity by passenger carriers. For these reasons,we proposed to retain part 1136 only as it pertains to rail passenger carriers.We propose to revise 49 CFR 1331.5 in substantial part. Part 1331 governsapplications by rate bureaus seeking immunity from the antitrust laws tonegotiate collective rates. The Motor Carrier Act of 1980 changed approvalstandards considerably by narrowing the range of actions that could beimmunized. Section 5 of part 1331 was added to provide guidance for ratebureaus seeking approval of amended agreements filed under the mandateof the Act. Not until 1986, however, did the Commission give priority toreviewing existing agreements for compliance. Now, we have given finalapproval to about two thirds of the agreements, and have provisionallyapproved most others. Viewed in this context, 49 CFR 1331.5, as it currentlyreads, has served its purpose. To make part 1331 more meaningful, we propose:(1) Revising the title of section 5 to clarify that it governs all ratebureaus, not just motor passenger carrier bureaus; and (2) prescribingrules on retaining antitrust immunity to replace the rules on seeking approvalof agreements since we have approved most agreements.Finally, we propose to remove parts 1080, 1083, and 1085 in their entirety.Part 1080 covers the contents and filing of contracts between householdgoods freight forwarders and motor carriers. Part 1083 concerns the filingof contracts between household goods freight forwarders for joint loadingand terminal services and facilities. Removal of these Parts is consistentwith the relaxation of contract filing requirements and our experiencethat filing these contracts is not necessary to enfore the statute. Part1085 requires that a household goods freight forwarder (HHGFF) give shipperscertain information, including Commission office locations where complaintsmay be filed. The Part does not apply where the HHGFF has actual noticethat the shipper has already received the information. Much of the trafficmoves in foreign commerce and involves personnel relocations by the Departmentof Defense or by internationl corporations in the private sector. The Commissionhas received few complaints under this part. The opportunity for abuseis minimal, has not arisen, and does not warrant retention of Part 1085.Additional information is contained in the Commission's decision.
