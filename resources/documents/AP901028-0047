At least 10 people have been arrested in connection with theOct. 12 attack that killed People's Assembly speaker Rifaatel-Mahgoub, his driver and four security men, police said.

Early Saturday, authorities raided a Cairo apartment andarrested five men accused of taking part in the slaying.   Later, two suspects were killed and two were captured followinga shootout at Cairo University, police reported.   Security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, say themen are members of the extremist groups Jihad and Salvation fromHell.   Jihad was responsible for Sadat's assassination, and Salvationfrom Hell was blamed for the attempted killing in 1987 of twoformer interior ministers and a journalist close to President HosniMubarak.   Both groups have been charged with attempting to replace Egypt'ssecular government with an Islamic theocratic rule.   Government sources also suspect Iraq had a role in theel-Mahgoub assassination, as punishment for Egypt's stand againstBaghdad in the Persian Gulf crisis.</TEXT></DOC>
