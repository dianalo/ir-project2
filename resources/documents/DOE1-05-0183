A thermal luminescence (TL) age determining methodwas introduced in this report; a study method called an alteration agemapping wherein numerous age values are obtained for one altered zoneis a simple method of measurement. By measuring various altering agefor various altered zones, changes in the hydrothermal systems and therelation with the surface geothermal symptoms. As a result, it was clarifiedthat the geothermal activity of the Kakkonda and Omatsukurazawa areaswas a regenerating activity which were caused by using old alterationzones as a cap rock, and the concrete figures were obtained for the periodand the duration of the activity. Almost all the ground surface geothermalsymptoms are found in the zones of such relatively new alteration ageas 300,000 years. This gives a bright prospect for the geothermal explorationby TL alteration age method. (5 figs, 1 tab, 18 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
