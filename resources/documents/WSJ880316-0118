First RepublicBank said that it was forced to seek a government-assisted rescue after its banks had increasing difficulties raising funds in recent weeks. Yesterday, the once proud and confident banking company turned to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for emergency funds, its first withdrawal from the Fed's discount window in years.    Gerald W. Fronterhouse, chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview late yesterday that First RepublicBank had been relying increasingly on overnight funds it purchased from other banks as its deposit base eroded, but the amount of money and the cost of borrowing from the so-called federal-funds market forced the bank to tap the discount window.    In the first two months of this year, First RepublicBank, which isn't connected with San Francisco-based First Republic Bancorp, said average deposits at all of its banks have shrunk by about $1.9 billion, or about 7.5%, including a five-day period last month at its flagship Dallas bank, when some $600 million departed.    &quot;Naturally, we had hoped to work our way out of the current difficulties without assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,&quot; Mr. Fronterhouse said. But the financial condition of the corporation, with $33.2 billion in assets at the end of last year, had deteriorated markedly recently as it began to acknowledge huge loan problems and reported a $656.3 million net loss last year.    As a cost-saving step, albeit a modest one, First RepublicBank said it rescinded payments of quarterly dividends on all classes of its preferred stock. The payments, totaling about $9 million a quarter, were scheduled to be paid April 1 and had been announced only a month ago, when the company was still confident it would survive without assistance. First RepublicBank suspended quarterly dividend payouts on its common stock last year.    Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, First RepublicBank's common shares closed at $1.50, down 25 cents, on unusually heavy trading of more than 1.5 million shares. Prices of other classes of common and preferred also slid.    In Washington yesterday, the FDIC confirmed that it has held preliminary discussions about a rescue of some First RepublicBank units. But FDIC officials said it is undecided what form the federal rescue could take. Either way, a bailout of First RepublicBank could be one of the largest banking rescues in history.    Mr. Fronterhouse said yesterday that the First RepublicBank board decided to continue working with two New York investment banking firms, understood to be Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., that are separately attempting to come up with a proposal that First RepublicBank might present to the FDIC for recapitalizing the company's banks. Mr. Fronterhouse said he expects that First RepublicBank should be able to offer a plan to the FDIC &quot;in two to three weeks,&quot; after internal reviews.    He said it is too early to say what that plan might include. He acknowledged that one concept includes spinning off a major portion of the company's $4 billion in nonperforming loans and carving out a &quot;good&quot; bank that might be recapitalized by new investors. However, Mr. Fronterhouse said he didn't know if an adequate amount of investor money could be attracted to a Texas banking company. One estimate is that a First RepublicBank rescue could require $4.5 billion in fresh capital, including whatever portion the FDIC might contribute. A bailout of that size would match the 1984 rescue of Continental Illinois Corp.    First RepublicBank's problems worsened in the past few weeks as individual and corporate customers switched to other financial institutions at least some of their money. The withdrawal threatens the ability of some First RepublicBank units to meet future cash withdrawals. The withdrawals were prompted in part by a rating service's downgrading of First RepublicBank's certificates of deposit.    In fact, officials familiar with First RepublicBank's condition said that one reason it decided to seek federal help is that it feared major, seasonal withdrawals by government and corporate depositors later this month.    Separately, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it lowered ratings on about $850 million of First RepublicBank debt. The issues were placed on CreditWatch with negative implications earlier this month. The rating concern said it also downgraded First RepublicBank's Dallas banking units' certificates of deposit and letters of credit to Single-B-minus/C from Double-B/B.    Asset quality and funding pressures have necessitated an appeal for FDIC assistance, Sandamp;P said, in downgrading the issues. Sandamp;P said it downgraded First RepublicBank's senior debt to Triple-C-minus from Single-B-plus; its subordinated debt to Single-C from Single-B-minus; its preferred stock to Single-C from Triple-C-plus and its commercial paper to Single-C from Single-B. </TEXT></DOC>
