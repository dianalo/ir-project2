The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is trying toset up a consortium to build a new facility for testingcommercial satellites. Up to one-third of the money wouldcome from government investments, with as much as half comingfrom private loans arranged with government encouragement.Manufacturers would supply the rest of the capital.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;For Japanese makers to develop their own commercialsatellites, they have to have a large-scale testing chamber,&quot;Katsumi Osuga, director of the ministry's spacecommunications policy division, said in an interview. But&quot;the market is too small because the American satellites aremore cost effective,&quot; he added.   &quot;The {Japanese} makers can't afford it alone,&quot; said Mr.Osuga, &quot;so the presidents of four Japanese companies sent theministry an appeal for help.&quot; The August 7 plea, he said,came from Mitsubishi Electric Corp., NEC Corp., Toshiba Corp.and Hitachi Ltd.   The Japanese companies have reportedly been worried abouttheir prospects ever since the Japanese government decidedlast year it would no longer guarantee them a chunk of theburgeoning market for communications, broadcast, and othercommercial satellite projects.   Under the policy, which was forced by Bush administrationthreats of trade sanctions, the more advanced American andEuropean makers can submit competing bids for those projects.Later this week, Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp. isexpected to take bids from several foreign makers on asatellite purchase originally guaranteed to a Japanesecompany.   Mr. Osuga stressed that the telecommunications ministry'sproposal -- first reported in yesterday's Nihon KeizaiShimbun, Japan's daily financial newspaper -- doesn't violatethe trade agreement. He said the government doesn't considerits help a &quot;subsidy&quot; because the makers will ultimately haveto pay back the loans and investments. He said that Americanand European companies would be free to invest in the testfacility and to use it under the same terms the Japanesecompanies will. He added that the government's procurementpolicy remains open.   The ministry included the testing facility proposal in itsoverall budget plan for the fiscal year starting April 1,which it submitted to the Ministry of Finance at the end oflast month. The finance ministry and the Diet must stillapprove the project. The total cost of the facility could beabout 10 billion yen ($73.6 million), and thetelecommunications ministry would allocate about 400 millionyen in the first year. The facility would be completed around1998.   An official at the U.S. embassy in Tokyo said he wasn'tfamiliar with the proposal and couldn't comment. An NECspokesman said the company &quot;has been told about this kind ofproject but we haven't decided yet how we're going toparticipate.&quot; Spokesmen for the other companies weren'tavailable for comment or said they couldn't comment.</TEXT></DOC>
