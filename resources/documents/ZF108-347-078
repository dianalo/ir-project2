 Users can create as many as99,999 accounts, each one containing up to 999 subaccounts, and can alsoconsolidate data from as many as 99 companies.andP;  Only one time period can beopen at a time, but users can post to the previous 25 periods.andP;  Other modulespost to the general ledger only upon user command.andM;There is a good selection of built-in reports, with an &quot;option grid&quot; thatlets users specify criteria for the records that will appear on thosereports.andM;SBT does not, however, offer a report writer.andP;  Both the PC and Macintoshproducts are written in the dBASE III language, so users who need to producecustomized reports purchase a dBASE-compatible report writer.andM;Because both versions use the same dBASE file structures, they can exchangefiles easily.andP;  By using run-time versions of FoxBASE on both systems, userscan even share files on a network of PCs and Macs.andM;The PC and Mac versions, however, are not identical.andP;  The Mac version sportsa Mac-style user interface with standard pull-down menus and dialogue boxes.andO;Unfortunately, it retains a few vestiges of its PC heritage; in theinstallation procedure, for example, SBT cautions against using blank spacesin drive or folder names.andM;Both versions are fairly easy to use, and the reliable documentation helpsoffset the lack of an on-line Help facility.andM;The Database Accounting Library is available both directly from the firm andin customized versions from many resellers.andM;PC modules cost $295 each for single-user versions and $595 each formultiuser versions.andP;  The Mac modules are available only in $695 multiuserversions.andP;  Source is also available upon request with the multiuser versions.andM;There is no separate inventory module.andP;  Instead, SBT includes inventoryfeatures in the Accounts Receivable module.andM;Sales order and purchase order modules are also available on both systems.andO;Several other modules, including fixed assets and job cost, are availableonly on the PC.andM;Software Business Technology Corp. can be reached in Sausalito, Calif., at(800) 227-7193 or (415) 331-9900.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;&quot;It's a flexible program that you can use to build around your business,rather than building your business around some software,&quot; said Eric Rogge,business manager at Strite Construction, a remodeling contractor in Boise,Idaho.andP;  Rogge is running the PC version on Compaq Computer Corp. 286 andPackard Bell 386 computers.andM;SBT's Database Accounting Library comes with source code, so it was possibleto modify the program to suit the company's needs, he said.andP;  For instance, hewas able to simplify the data-entry process in the job costing module andchange the entry screens.andP;  The product needs an on-screen Help system, headded.andM;Jerry Simper, vice president of First Choice Inns Inc., a hotel managementfirm in Bainbridge Island, Wash., found the availability of source code to behelpful.andM;&quot;We have some particular needs in job costing that we had to modify for,&quot; hesaid.andP;  Another criterion for choosing the product was dBASE filecompatibility, he added.andM;The database in the Macintosh version lets users import files directly fromFoxBASE Pro for the PC as well as other PC database files, he said.andM;However, FoxBASE+/Mac 2.0 has a problem working with SBT's product, heclaimed.andP;  &quot;When you try to escape from a print command, it escapes to thedesktop,&quot; he said.andP;  SBT is aware of the problem and is working to correct it,according to Simper.andM;Refining the Macintosh screens would be an improvement for the product, andthe interface ought to be more like the Macintosh, Simper said.andM;&quot;The interface is like a hybrid,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;In some areas you can use amouse, but in some places you have to tab over.andP;  It's built to do fast dataentry without the mouse.&quot;andM;According to Simper, SBT's product runs slowly on an AppleTalk network; herecommends using it on an Ethernet network.andP;  &quot;It will slow down to the pointwhere it is unacceptable and takes 30 seconds to do some posting,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;On Ethernet, as soon as the screen refreshes, you are ready to roll.&quot;andM;Another PC accounting-software ven dor is entering the Macintosh market.andP;  Asthis issue went to press, Champion Business Systems Inc., of Golden, Colo.,andO;was beta testing a Mac version of its PC-based Champion III BusinessAccounting Software version 89.12.andM;PC Week tested Champion's current PC version and a beta-test copy of the Macproduct.andM;Both the PC and Mac versions offer solid basic accounting features, with thenumbers of accounts and companies limited only by the available disk spaceand as many as 24 periods capable of being opened at once.andM;The modules are written in dBASE III and can be used with a run-time versionof Clipper on the PC and a run-time version of FoxBASE+/Mac on the Mac.andM;The Mac and PC versions look almost identical, which means that the Macintoshproduct looks much too PC-like.andP;  For example, users must type folder namesrather than choosing them from a dialogue box.andM;PC Week initially installed the product a few folders deep and could not fitthe path name of any file in the space provided by the program.andO;Subsequently, the entire program had to go in a &quot;shallow&quot; folder.andM;The Mac and PC versions also use the same dBASE file structures.andM;However, there is no direct file-exchange mechanism for moving files betweenthe PC and the Macintosh.andM;Despite these problems, though, the products are fairly easy to use.andM;Champion offers single-user versions of all five basic modules for $450 eachon either the PC or the Mac.andP;  Multiuser PC modules cost $550 each.andM;Unfortunately, there is no multiuser support for the Macintosh modules.andP;  TheMac modules also do not support multiple companies, and the PC Report Writermodule is not currently available for the Macintosh.andM;Champion Business Systems Inc. can be reached at (800) 243-2626 or (303)278-8666.andM;-- Mark L. Van NameandM;and Bill CatchingsandM;All of the accounting packages in this review, except the Great PlainsAccounting Series, used the dBASE language to run on both PCs and Macs.andM;A few years ago, products such as FoxBASE+/Mac and McMax brought the dBASElanguage and file formats to the Macintosh.andM;By recompiling their PC source code with such products, Champion BusinessSystems Inc., Lake Avenue Software Inc. and Software Business TechnologyCorp. (SBT) could move their PC accounting packages to the Mac.andM;Unfortunately, some of these Mac versions were so close to the PC originalsthat they ignored the Mac's user-interface standards.andP;  The Lake Avenue andChampion Mac packages, for example, are likely to be far too PC-like forexperienced Mac users.andM;SBT has taken a step in the right direction by making its entries use suchMac standards as pull-down menus, buttons and dialogue boxes.andP;  These changesrun the risk of increasing training time for PC users, but they are a boonfor Mac users.andM;By demanding such efforts from vendors, buyers can enjoy both the benefits ofdBASE products and get Mac versions that conform to current Mac standards.andO;-- Mark L.
