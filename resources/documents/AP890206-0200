Ben Jones how he feels aboutthe 51 percent congressional pay raise and he'll tell you to readhis lips. Then he'll twist them into contortions defying translation.   Jones, the TV actor-turned-Georgia politician, demonstrated thatevasion technique at a black-tie dinner the other night. It wascomedy with a message.   The 101st Congress is in a political and parliamentary maze onpay, an issue that has nagged senators and representatives since thefirst.   While he backed this raise, President Bush said that in a perfectworld the members of Congress would vote on salaries instead ofoperating under a system of raises by remote control. That vision ofperfection is not widely shared at the Capitol.   For 200 years, setting pay has been a headache for members, whofear voter retribution for approving their own raises. For the last20, the Senate and House have sought political shelter in a systemdesigned to spare them votes on their own salaries.   Using one of the best-tested of political hedges, Congress turnedthe pay dilemma over to a commission. That usually means gettingsomebody else to cope with a high-risk issue, preferably somebodywho doesn't have to run for re-election.   That process was supposed to make Congress a spectator whensalary commissions proposed pay increases for House and Senate, thefederal courts and the top tier of the executive branch. Thepresident can accept, reject or modify before sending the payrecommendation on to Congress, which gets the raise unless bothhouses vote no within 30 days.   That sounded foolproof. It isn't.   It led to intramural bickering at the Capitol, since the Senateoften has had free, politically-popular votes against pay raisesthat took effect anyhow for lack of House rejection. That seemed tobe happening again, but the game plan came apart in the Housebecause of widespread public opposition to the $45,500 raise thecommission recommended.   Congressional pay is a ready-made issue for an electionchallenger _ who, if elected, comes to see the need for highersalaries in a new light.   That instinct showed when Republicans tried to use ``yet anotherwhopping pay increase'' as a 1989 fundraising issue. But they had todrop it because President Reagan recommended the raise and PresidentBush endorsed it, both coupling support with a ban on thespeechmaking fees many members have used to supplement their pay.   The pay commission said the increase is needed to restore a 35percent drop in the spending power of congressional, judicial andtop executive branch salaries during the past 20 years. Debateseldom centers on the merits of an increase, although the size ofthis one has made it particularly vulnerable to voter wrath.   Congress has tried again and again to find a system that wouldcalm the salary issue. There have been proposals to turn the issueover to a permanent, independent panel; even to have the SupremeCourt set congressional salaries.   Nor is there new business in the call for reform as the price ofa pay raise. President Ford said his endorsement of a 1977 raise wasbased on ``a firm commitment to a new code of conduct'' that was tohave included a ban on moneymaking speeches. The raise took effectwithout the ban.   One salary commission called the whole business a prolongedadventure in futility. Prolonged indeed. The first Congress, in1789, got $6 a day. That was raised to $1,500 a year in 1816,stirring a voter rebellion that ousted incumbents including DanielWebster. That led to repeal and an $8 daily wage.   When the Bill of Rights was proposed, so was a constitutionalamendment forbidding any Congress from raising its pay until afterthe next election. It never was ratified. The assumption was thatHouse and Senate would vote on their salaries, and that theirconstituents would be the final judges.   Now the sytem avoids pay votes.   Lloyd Cutler, chairman of the salary commission, said that's theway it should be. In advocating a raise without a direct vote,Cutler, a Washington lawyer and former Democratic White Housecounsel, said utility infielders who bat .200 are being paid morethan judges and members of Congress.   Some are. But they do have to risk going to bat.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter R.
