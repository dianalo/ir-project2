Federal Programs Generally </ITAG>The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), 30 U.S.C.1201 <T3>et seq., </T3>established a nationwide program for the regulation ofsurface coal mining and reclamation operations. To provide a consistentregulatory framework for this nationwide program, section 501(b) of SMCRArequires the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to promulgate apermanent regulatory program. The permanent program regulations are groupedin 30 CFR Chapter VII. These regulations include performance standardsfor surface coal mining and reclamation operations (Subchapter K) and proceduresfor establishing State and Federal programs (Subchapter C). Pursuant to section 503 of SMCRA, a State program may be established that,with certain exceptions, gives a State exclusive jurisdiction over theregulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations within itsborders. Where a State does not establish a State program, section 504of SMCRA requires the Secretary to establish a Federal program for thatState. Standards and procedures that govern Federal programs and theirpromulgation appear in Subchapter C at 30 CFR Part 736. Once the decision is made that a Federal program is necessary for a State,the Secretary must make several determinations before promulgating a program.Section 504(a) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 736.22(a)(1) require that the Secretarytake into consideration the nature of the State's soils, topography, climate,and biological, chemical, geological, hydrological, agronomic, and otherrelevant physical conditions. Section 505(b) of SMCRA provides that ifa State has more stringent land use and environmental protection laws orregulations, they shall not be construed to be inconsistent with SMCRAor the Secretary's regulations. The Secretary believes that the requirementsof section 505(b) of SMCRA can best be met by identifying any State lawsand regulations that may impose more stringent environmental controls andby listing them in the Federal program. If the State's laws or regulationsestablish more stringent standards than those of SMCRA or the Secretary'sregulations, or if the State regulates any aspect of the environment thatneither SMCRA nor the Secretary's regulations protect, the Secretary wouldthen specifically preserve those State standards in the Federal programand any permits issued pursuant thereto.Section 504(g) of SMCRA specifies that any State statutes or regulationsthat regulate surface mining and reclamation operations are to be identifiedby the Secretary and will be superseded and preempted by the Federal programto the extent that they interfere with the achievement of the purposesand requirements of SMCRA and the Federal program. This provision is reinforcedby section 505(a) of SMCRA, which states that only inconsistent State lawsshall be superseded by any provision of SMCRA or regulation. Thus, Statestatutes and rules regulating the same activities as those covered by theFederal law and regulations and that do not provide as much protectionas do the Federal law and regulations are considered to interfere withthe achievement of the purposes and requirements of SMCRA. Accordingly,they must be identified and preempted.Finally, a Federal program, according to section 504(h) of SMCRA, mustinclude a process for coordinating the review and issuance of surface miningpermits with other Federal or State permits applicable to the proposedoperation. The Federal statutes for which compliance must be coordinatedin the issuance of a surface mining permit are set out in 30 CFR 736.22(c).State statutes for which a permit is required must be identified in theprocess of promulgating a Federal program, and the Federal program mustprovide for coordination with the permit review and issuance procedures.To the degree practicable, OSMRE will coordinate coal mining permit requirementswith State agencies to avoid unnecessary duplication.Federal programs are based on the Secretary's permanent program regulations,30 CFR Subchapters A, F, G, H, J, K, L and M. The permanent program regulationsimplement five essential aspects of the surface coal mining regulatoryprogram: permitting, performance standards, designation of lands as unsuitablefor mining, bonding and inspection and enforcement. These rules form thebenchmark for State and Federal regulatory programs.The permanent program rules refer to the ``regulatory authority,'' which,under a Federal program, is the Secretary. The Secretary has delegatedall of his authority under SMCRA to the Assistant Secretary-Land and MineralsManagement (Secretarial Order Nos. 3013 and 3099 of November 9, 1977 andDecember 22, 1983 respectively). With limited exceptions, the AssistantSecretary has in turn redelegated all of this authority under SMCRA tothe Director, OSMRE, through the DOI Departmental Manual (216 DM 1, November9, 1977). Thus, the Director, OSMRE, is the official directly responsiblefor the implementation of a Federal regulatory program.The parts of the permanent regulatory program rules that must be includedin a Federal program are listed in 30 CFR 736.22(b). They include the generalrequirements and definitions (Parts 700 and 701), the exemption for coalextraction incident to government-financed highway or other construction(Part 707), the designation of lands as unsuitable for surface mining (Parts761, 762 and 764), permits and permit applications (Subchapter G), reclamationbonding (Subchapter J), performance standards (Subchapter K), inspectionand enforcement (Parts 842, 843 and 845) and blaster training and certification(Subchapter M).To take full advantage of the existing permanent program regulations whileavoiding unnecessary repetition, most of the rules that make up each Federalprogram do not themselves set out detailed requirements, but instead cross-referencea corresponding part in the permanent program. In situations where a cross-referenceto the permanent program does not meet the needs of a particular State,the Federal program rule for that State also includes an additional paragraphor paragraphs with appropriate detailed requirements. For example, theFederal program for California will be codified at 30 CFR Part 905. Thegeneral requirements for permits and permit applications, andSection; 905.773,in paragraph (a) cross-references the corresponding Part 773 of the permanentprogram regulations. In addition, paragraphs (d) through (g) provide State-specificpermit application review procedures.One effect of this cross-referencing from the Federal program to the permanentprogram is that whenever a permanent program rule is revised, each Federalprogram rule that cross-references that particular permanent program ruleis similarly revised. The notice of proposed rulemaking to revise the permanentprogram rule would invite comments not only on the proposed rule generally,but also on how the change might affect a particular Federal program. Ifcertain changes are needed for a Federal program, then a separate provisionwould be added to the Federal program rule that is the counterpart of thepermanent program rule.Several provisions of the permanent program rules already apply to allFederal programs because they were promulgated for application to all regulatoryprograms and therefore need not be cross-referenced. These provisions are30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter P_Protection of Employees, Part 706_Restrictionson Financial Interests of Federal Employees.

California Federal Program</ITAG>A. BackgroundOn July 28, 1982, OSMRE published a proposed Federal program for Californiato regulate coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operationson non-Federal and non-Indian lands in that State (47 FR 32686). On August12, 1982, OSMRE postponed the scheduled public hearing and extended thecomment period indefinitely (47 FR 35011). During the comment period, OSMREwas informed by the California Division of Mines and Geology that all knowncoal deposits in California were too small and of too poor quality forcommercial recovery in the foreseeable future.As a result of California's comments, it was determined that developmentof the State's known coal reserves on non-Federal and non-Indian landswas extremely unlikely and that a regulatory program was not needed. Publicationof this determination was made in the May 10, 1983, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(48 FR 20939). The notice also provided that,``Should information come to light which indicates an increased likelihoodof coal exploration or surface coal mining on non-Federal and non-Indianlands within the State, promulgation of the required program will be reinitiatedby subsequent rulemaking notice.''Subsequent information available to OSMRE indicated that coal explorationand coal surface mining operations do exist in the State, and OSMRE determinedit was necessary to promulgate a Federal program for the State of California.Therefore, on October 22, 1987, OSMRE published a proposed Federal programfor California in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 39594). The proposal was consistent withthe previous proposed rulemaking of July 28, 1982 (47 FR 32690) althoughsome modifications were made to take into account revisions OSMRE had madeto its permanent program rules since that date. The notice announced a70-day comment period ending on December 31, 1987, and a public hearingon December 24, 1987, in Sacramento, California. Shortly afterward, OSMREextended the comment period to January 21, 1988, and rescheduled the publichearing for January 14, 1988 to avoid conflict with the holiday season(52 FR 44918, November 23, 1987).Section 504(a) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 736.22(a)(1) require that each Federalprogram consider the nature of the State's soils, topography, climate,and biological, chemical, geological, hydrological, agronomic, and otherrelevant physical conditions. Section 505(b) of SMCRA provides that ifa State has more stringent land use and environmental protection laws orregulations, they shall not be construed to be inconsistent with SMCRAor the Secretary's regulations. Section 504(g) of SMCRA specifies thatany State statutes or regulations that regulate surface coal mining andreclamation operations are to be identified by the Secretary and will besuperseded and preempted by the Federal program to the extent that theyinterefere with the achievement of the purposes and requirements of SMCRAand the Federal program.OSMRE reviewed California statutes to determine which ones provide regulatoryrequirements for coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamationoperations as defined by SMCRA, and to identify provisions that might beeither more stringent than or inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA.The more stringent requirements, whether State or Federal, have been adoptedfor this program. Section 905.700(e) lists the State statutes that setmore stringent controls and for which compliance is required in the surfacecoal mining and reclamation operation. Although OSMRE has made a comprehensivesearch of California law, the list in andSection; 905.700(e) may not be complete.OSMRE does not intend an omission to mean that a permittee does not haveto meet those obligations under State law. To the contrary, any relevantState law not superseded by these rules must be complied with by permitteesand permit applicants.Determining whether State statutes are more stringent than the Federalregulations will often require a case-by-case analysis, the result of whichcannot be predetermined. Citation in the program of State statutes withwhich compliance is required is not meant as an adoption of those Statestatutes for purposes of enforcement by OSMRE. Citation of such statutesis instead intended as an aid to persons who must comply with both theFederal program requirements and State statutes.OSMRE has primarily cited statutes, and has minimized citations to theCalifornia Administrative Code, in the various parts of the CaliforniaFederal program. This is because State regulations can readily change andOSMRE's incorporation of these changes would necessarily lag behind them.However, if an operator must comply with a State statute, the operatormust also comply with the State regulations that implement the statute.In accordance with 30 CFR 736.23, OSMRE has identified the California statutescited at andSection; 905.700(f) as inconsistent with the requirements ofSMCRA and the Federal program and thus superseded by the Federal programto the extent they relate to coal exploration or surface coal mining andreclamation operations subject to regulation under SMCRA. Permittees willbe required to conduct surface coal mining activities in compliance withall other existing State statutes and regulations.Section 504(h) of SMCRA requires that each Federal program include a processfor coordinating the review and issuance of surface mining permits withother Federal or State permits applicable to the proposed operation. OSMREwill coordinate permit requirements with State agencies to the degree practicableto avoid unnecessary duplication. The California Department of Conservation,Division of Mines and Geology, has statutory responsibility for administeringand enforcing the laws and rules pertaining to surface mining.OSMRE has concluded that this responsibility interferes with the achievementof the purposes of the Federal program. Therefore, after the effectivedate of the Federal program, the California statutes cited in andSection;905.700(f) will no longer be applicable to the regulation of coal exploration,surface coal mining operations or the reclamation of surface coal minedlands in the State of California except insofar as they are as stringentas or more stringent than the Federal provisions.The Federal statutes for which compliance must be coordinated in the issuanceof a surface mining permit are set out in 30 CFR 736.22(c). Federal andState statutes for which a permit is required are identified in andSection;905.773(b). The California Federal program provides for coordination withthese permit review and issuance procedures by stipulating that no personmay conduct coal exploration or surface coal mining operations withoutfirst obtaining all other necessary permits from the State in andSection;905.773(c).B. Content and Organization of the ProgramThe content and organization of the Federal program for California followsthe permanent program regulations. As discussed above, however, insteadof the full text appearing, each section includes only a reference to thepertinent permanent program regulation part. Sections 905.700 (e) and (f)set out more stringent and inconsistent State statutes and regulationsrespectively. A separate paragraph has been added under any section wherethere are deviations from the Federal permanent program regulation forthe California Federal program. These paragraphs will generally be foundin a subsection (b).The content and organization of the Federal program for California is basedon the following provisions of the Federal permanent program regulations,30 CFR Chapter VII:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Subchapter A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Subchapter F_Areas Unsuitable for Mining</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Subchapter G_Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations Permitsand Coal Exploration Systems Under Regulatory Programs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Subchapter H_Small Operator Assistance</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Subchapter J_Bonding and Insurance Requirements for Surface Coal Miningand Reclamation Operations</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Subchapter K_Permanent Program Performance Standards</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Subchapter L_Permanent Program Inspection and Enforcement Procedures</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Part 955_Certification of Blasters in Federal Program States and onIndian LandsTechnical literature cited by OSMRE in the preambles to the permanent regulatoryprogram and subsequent rulemaking notices revising those rules was reliedupon in developing the California Federal program. The reader is referredto those preambles for a discussion of the basis and purpose of the permanentprogram rules proposed to be referenced in the California program withoutsubstantive change.The numbering system of the permanent program regulations has been incorporatedinto the numbering system for the proposed California Federal program.Subchapter T in 30 CFR Chapter VII has been established to include regulatoryprograms by State in alphabetical order. Each State is assigned a partnumber; the regulatory program for California is assigned Part 905. Programelements have been categorized under headings similar to the subchaptertitles of the permanent program in 30 CFR Chapter VII.C. Detailed Discussion<T3>General</T3>_Section 905.700 contains six subsections. The first four,subsections 905.700 (a), (b), (c) and (d), contain general statements onthe scope and applicability of the program. Section 905.700(e) lists CaliforniaState laws that have been identified as having provisions that regulateactivities involved in surface coal mining operations and are more stringentthan SMCRA and the Secretary's regulations. The second sentence of thesubsection provides for an instance when a provision of one of the listedState laws establishes less environmental protection than does the Federalprogram, and the operator is placed in a situation of complying with oneand violating the other. Section 905.700(f) identifies the California Statelaws interfering with the achievement of the purposes of SMCRA and Federalregulations and, therefore, being preempted and superseded by this Federalprogram insofar as they pertain to surface coal mining. The subsectionalso allows preemption of other State laws in an instance where the Federalact or regulations set more stringent standards than an unpreempted Statelaw.Sections 905.701 through 905.707 establish the same provisions, where applicable,as 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter A, General. Section 905.701(a) containsall applicable general requirements, including the definitions in 30 CFR700.5 and 701.5. Subsection (b) makes clear that beginning on the effectivedate of this program and continuing until an operation has a permanentprogram permit issued by OSMRE, compliance with the initial program standardsin 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter B is required. Section 502(c) of SMCRAprovides that all surface coal mining operations on lands on which suchoperations are regulated by a State shall comply with the initial programstandards until a permanent program permit is issued. Paragraph (c) providesthat records required by 30 CFR 700.14 to be made available locally tothe public shall be retained at the OSMRE Albuquerque Field Office. Section905.707 establishes the same requirements as 30 CFR Part 707, Exemptionfor Coal Extraction Incident to Government-Financed Highway or Other Construction.<T3>Areas Designated Unsuitable for Mining</T3>_Sections 905.761 through905.764 establish the same provisions, where applicable, as 30 CFR ChapterVII, Subchapter F, Areas Unsuitable for Mining. However, 30 CFR 736.15(b)(1)provides that the procedures and criteria for designating lands unsuitableshall be implemented one year after a Federal program is made effectivefor a State. Therefore, andSection; 905.764 provides that Part 764 shallapply beginning one year after the effective date of the California program.No separate section for Federal lands is included because 30 CFR Part 769is directly applicable and need not be made a part of a Federal programfor a State.<T3>Permits and Coal Exploration Approvals</T3>_Sections 905.772 through905.785 establish the same provisions, where applicable, as 30 CFR ChapterVII, Subchapter G, Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations Permitsand Coal Exploration Systems under Regulatory Programs. The following amplificationshave been made:For exploration applications where 30 CFR 772.12 applies, andSection; 905.772(b)requires publication by the applicant of public notice of the filing uponsubmission of an administratively complete application. Section 905.772(c)allows ten days after publication of the public notice for persons adverselyaffected to file written comments. Section 905.772(d) requires the regulatoryauthority to act upon a complete exploration application and any writtencomments within 15 days from the close of the comment period.In andSection; 905.773, Requirements for permits and permit processing, subsection(b) has been added to list Federal laws and corresponding or relevant Statelaws that need to be coordinated by OSMRE in order to prevent or minimizeduplication of effort with California. Section 905.773(c) has been addedthat contains the stipulation that no person may conduct coal explorationor surface coal mining and reclamation operations without first obtainingall other necessary permits from the State and lists State laws with whichthe Secretary will endeavor to coordinate when issuing a surface miningpermit under this Federal program.In addition to the requirements under the permanent program rules, otherprovisions are added for permit review. More detail is necessary when OSMREis the regulatory authority in order to provide direction to the permitapplicant. Section 905.773(d) establishes specific permit application reviewprocedures. This is necessary to dispose of grossly deficient applicationsearly in processing, to provide a procedure for obtaining additional information,and to indicate the procedure for determinations of completeness. Section905.773(e) allows OSMRE to require an applicant to submit supplementalinformation to ensure compliance with applicable Federal laws and regulationsother than SMCRA and its implementing regulations. Section 905.773(f) establishes,pursuant to 30 CFR 773.15(a)(1), a time period of 60 days from the closeof the comment period for the regulatory authority to issue a written decision.Section 905.773(g) establishes a procedure for ensuring confidentialityof qualified permit application information. Such information must be labeledconfidential and submitted separately to be reviewed by OSMRE for withholdingfrom disclosure. In addition, andSection;905.773(g)(1) requires the publicnotice required by andSection;905.773(d)(3) to identify the type of informationconsidered to be confidential. Finally, andSection;905.773(g)(2) requiresOSMRE to rule on the confidentiality of labeled application informationwithin ten days of the last publication of the notice required under andSection;905.773(d)(3).Section 905.774(b) provides that a revision of the permit will be consideredsignificant if it has the potential to adversely affect the achievementof reclamation as specified in the approved plan. A significant revisionrequires public notice and is subject to a formal hearing if one is requested.Section 905.774(c) specifies a period of 30 days within which OSMRE mustapprove or disapprove non-significant permit revisions. Section 905.774(d)allows 30 days for any person having in interest that is or may be adverselyaffected by a decision on the transfer, assignment, or sale of permit rightsto submit written comments after publication of the notice required by30 CFR 774.17(b)(2). The proposed rule would have allowed 10 days but hasbeen revised in the final version to be consistent with the time periodallowed in other Federal program States for such comments. Section 905.774(e)allows interested persons and public entities 30 days from the last publicationof the notice to submit written comments or objections on an applicationfor significant revision or renewal of a permit. In andSection;905.777, a new subsection (b) has been added to provide thatany person wishing to conduct new surface coal mining and reclamation operationsshall file a complete application as early as possible prior to the datepermit issuance is desired and to pay a permit fee in accordance with 30CFR 777.17. Also, a new subsection (c) has been added that requires anyperson wishing to revise a permit to file a complete application as earlyas possible prior to the date approval of the permit revision is desiredand to pay a permit fee in accordance with 30 CFR 777.17. OSMRE is currentlyin the process of establishing fees for permits and permit revisions. Therefore,payment of a permit fee will be deferred until final promulgation of afee schedule. Prospective permit applicants should contact OSMRE's WesternField Operations office in Denver, Colorado, to determine the format foran application. The permanent program regulations at 30 CFR 779.19(a) give the regulatoryauthority discretion to require a map that delineates vegetation typesin the proposed permit area. Section 905.779(b) requires the applicantfor a surface mining permit to submit such a map. Similarly, andSection;905.783(b)exercises the discretion provided to the regulatory authority by 30 CFR783.19(a) to require a vegetation map for underground mining permits. <T3>Small Operator Assistance_</T3>Section 905.795 establishes the samestandards for the small operator assistance program (SOAP) as are foundin Part 795 of the permanent program rules. OSMRE expects during its administrationof the SOAP in California that Federal funds will be sufficient to providefor authorized services and does not expect to exercise its option at 30CFR 795.11(b). That option allows OMSRE to establish a formula for allocatinglimited funds to provide the service pursuant to Part 795. OSMRE will awardSOAP contracts to qualified laboratories utilizing a streamlined procurementsystem that complies with the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Prior toissuing a Request for Proposals, OSMRE will announce its intention throughpublication in the Commerce Business Daily. OSMRE will qualify laboratoriesas part of its contracting process. <T3>Bonding_</T3>Section 905.800 establishes the same provisions, whereapplicable, as 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter J, Bond and Insurance Requirementsfor Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations. Section 905.800(b)requires the operator to file an application for release of performancebond no later than 30 days prior to the end of the growing season. Section905.800(c) specifies the three types of acceptable bonds, surety bond,collateral bond and self-bond. These terms are defined in 30 CFR 800.5.Section 905.800(d) allows a permittee to replace existing bonds with otherbonds that provide equivalent coverage. <T3>Performance Standards</T3>_Sections 905.815 through 905.828 establishthe same provisions, where applicable, as 30 CFR Chapter VII, SubchapterK, Permanent Program Performance Standards. The following changes havebeen made:Section 905.816(b) has been added that lists State laws with which compliancegenerally will be required notwithstanding the preemption of the State'sSurface Mining Act. When the unpreempted State statute or regulation establishesa less stringent standard than does the Federal program, the operator maybe in a position of not being able to comply with both State and Federalprovisions. In such cases, OSMRE will make a determination that compliancewith the State law or regulation, as provided by section 504(g) of SMCRA,interferes with the purposes of the Federal program. Thus, the State statuteor regulation will be preempted in that instance so that compliance witha particular law could not be required by the State. In order to effectthe <T3>ad hoc </T3>preemption, OSMRE will publish a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> identifying the particular State law or regulationthat is being preempted. Section 905.816(c) requires that the standardsfor revegetation success for surface mining activities shall be those specifiedin 30 CFR 816.116(a)(2) and that the statistically valid sampling techniquesfor measuring success shall be included in the mining and reclamation plan.Section 905.817(b) has been added that lists for underground mining thesame State laws with which compliance is required under andSection; 905.816(b)for surface mining. In some instances these statutes and their implementingregulations establish more stringent standards than those found in 30 CFRParts 816 and 817.Determinations of stringency, however, will be made on a case-by-case basis.Section 908.817(c) requires that the standard for revegetation successfor underground mining activities shall be those specific in 30 CFR 817.116(a)(2)and that the statistically valid sampling technique for measuring successshall be included in the mining and reclamation plan.<T3>Inspection and Enforcement Procedures</T3>_Sections 905.842, 905.843and 905.845 establish the same provisions as 30 CFR Chapter VII, SubchapterL, Permanent Program Inspection and Enforcement Procedures. No changesto the inspection and enforcement provisions of the permanent program regulationshave been made for the California Federal program. Sections 905.842(b)and 905.843(b) require OSMRE to furnish the California Department of Conservation,Division of Mining and Geology, or request, copies of inspection reportsand enforcement actions, respectively. Section 905.846 incorporates Part846 of the permanent program regulations, <T3>Individual Civil Penalties, </T3>into the California Federal program.Section 905.846 was not included in the proposed California Federal programbecause Part 846 had not been promulgated at the time the proposal waspublished. Subsequently Part 846 was promulgated (53 Fr 3664, February8, 1988) and is therefore incorporated by reference into the final CaliforniaFederal program.<T3>Blaster Training and Certification</T3>_Section 905.955 establishesthe same provisions, where applicable, as 30 CFR Part 955.D. Response to CommentsOn October 22, 1987, OSMRE published a proposed Federal program for Californiain the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 39594). In the preamble to the proposedprogram, OSMRE invited comments from all interested persons. A public hearingwas scheduled for December 24, 1987 in Sacramento, California, and laterrescheduled for January 14, 1988. Since no one requested to testify atthe hearing, it was not held. The extended comment period closed on January21, 1988. During this time, OSMRE received comments from three State agencies,the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the CaliforniaDepartment of Health Services and the California State Water ResourcesControl Board, and from one Federal agency, the Advisory Council on HistoricPreservation.Most of the comments received by OSMRE concerned the State laws identifiedin the proposed program as being either more stringent than or supersededby the Federal regulations, in paragraphs (e) and (f) respectively of proposedandSection; 905.700. The California State agencies identified State lawsthat they believed were more stringent than the requirements of the Federalprogram. The changes made to the proposed program in response to thesecomments are discussed more fully in the responses to individual commentsbelow. Specific regulatory provisions addressing the permit coordinationprocess required pursuant to section 504(h) of SMCRA have been added tothe final rule at andSection;andSection; 905.773(b) and (c), 905.816(b) and905.817(b).One commenter identified the Z'berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act of 1973,Cal. Pub. Res. Code section 4511 <T3>et seq.</T3> as containing reforestation requirements and timberlandconversion mitigation requirements that are more stringent than the proposedregulations. The commenter suggested that the Forest Practice Act be listedat andSection; 905.700(e) of the California Federal program rules. OSMREhas examined the State statute and agrees that the Forest Practice Actmay establish more stringent standards than those contained in SMCRA orthe Secretary's regulations or may regulate an aspect of the environmentthat neither SMCRA nor the Secretary's regulations protect. The ForestPractice Act has been added to the list of more stringent State laws atandSection; 905.700(e). It should be emphasized that determining whetherState statutes are more stringent than the Federal regulations will behandled on a case-by-case basis. For the same reason, the Forest PracticeAct has been added to the Federal program provisions concerning permitcoordination (andSection;andSection; 905.773, 905.816 and 905.817). One commenter recommended changing paragraph (e)(1) of proposed andSection;905.700 to read, ``California Hazardous Waste Control Law, Cal. Healthandamp; Safety Code section 25100 <T3>et seq.</T3>'' instead of ``California Hazardous Waste Management Actof 1986, Cal. Health andamp; Safety Code section 25179.1 <T3>et seq.</T3>'' The commenter indicated that his recommendation is thecorrect citation for the body of State laws addressing control of hazardouswaste. OSMRE has accepted this change. The revised citation appears inparagraph (e)(3) of andSection; 905.700 of the final rule.The commenter recommended that two California State laws be added to thelist of more stringent State laws at paragraph (e) of andSection; 905.700of the proposed rule. These State laws are: The Porter-Cologne Water QualityControl Act, Cal. Water Code section 13000 <T3>et seq.; </T3>and The State Underground Storage of Hazardous SubstancesLaw, Cal. Health andamp; Safety Code section 25280 <T3>et seq.</T3>; OSMRE has examined these State statutes and agrees thatthey may establish more stringent standards than those contained in SMCRAof the Secretary's regulations or may regulate an aspect of the environmentthat neither SMCRA nor the Secretary's regulations protect. They have beenadded to the list of more stringent State laws at paragraphs (e)(2) and(e)(4) respectively of andSection; 905.700 of the final rule.The commenter also opposed the proposed preemption of the State HazardousWaste Control Law and implementing regulations in paragraphs (f)(4) and(f)(5) of proposed andSection; 905.700. According to the commenter, thislaw should be identified as more stringent than SMCRA and the Federal regulations;it was specifically enacted to provide additional protection to the environment.OSMRE agrees with the commenter and has deleted the State statute and itsimplementing regulations from paragraph (f) of andSection; 905.700 and addedthe State statute as paragraph (e)(3) of andSection; 905.700 of the finalrule.In addition, the commenter identified several State statutes for whicha permit is required, including section 1225 of the State Water Code, thePorter-Cologne Act, the Toxic Injection Well Control Act of 1985 and theToxic Pits Cleanup Act of 1984. OSMRE has examined these State statutesand agrees that the California Federal program should provide for coordinationwith them, where applicable. OSMRE has added section 1225 of the StateWater Code and the Porter-Cologne Act to paragraphs (b) and (c) of andSection;905.773 of the final rule. OSMRE did not include specific references tothe Toxic Injection Well Control Act of 1988 and the Toxic Pits CleanupAct of 1984 in the final rule. Citation in the final rule of the CaliforniaHazardous Waste Control Law (Cal. Health andamp; Safety Code Ann. section25100 <T3>et seq.</T3>) which is the body of State laws addressing control ofhazardous waste, is sufficient to provide for coordination with the provisionsof these two State laws.One commenter suggested that the preamble to the proposed rule did notprovide sufficient background information to allow the commenter ``to provideconstructive comments on the proposed rule.'' In reference to andSection;905.700(e)(1), (f)(4) and (f)(5) of the proposed rule, the commenter requestedthat additional information be sent to him concerning the proposed preemptionof the California Hazardous Waste Control Act and implementing regulationsalong with identification of a portion of the same statute as more stringentthan SMCRA and the Federal regulations. OSMRE believes that the commenter'sconcerns are addressed by the changes made to andSection; 905.700(e) and(f) in response to other commenters.One commenter suggested that the proposed program failed to provide clearlyfor OSMRE to meet its responsibilities under section 106 of the NationalHistoric Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 470 <T3>et seq. </T3>The commenter recommended integrating provisions for compliancewith the Act and its implementing regulations, 36 CFR Part 800, into thespecial provisions for compliance with the National Environmental PolicyAct in proposed andSection;905.773. OSMRE agrees with the commenter and hasmodified andSection;905.773(d)(5) and (f) accordingly. The commenter also suggested that the California Environmental QualityAct (CEQA), Cal. Pub. Res. Code Ann. section 21000 (West), be added tothe list of State statutes found to be more stringent than SMCRA or theFederal regulations by virtue of CEQA's provisions for the protection ofhistoric properties. OSMRE agrees and has added CEQA as paragraph (e)(1)of andSection;905.700 of the final rule. In addition, CEQA is listed in thefinal rule at paragraphs (b) and (c) of andSection;905.773 as one of theState statutes requiring coordination during permit review and issuance.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.
