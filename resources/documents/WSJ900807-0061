Despite the strong rhetoric, however, there's little thegovernment can do if it can't show some sort of collusion inthe oil industry.   The federal government dismantled the last controls overgasoline prices in 1981, and there is little interest inCongress for reimposing them. There were a few calls forprice controls earlier in the year when congressional panelsfocused attention on a spurt in heating oil prices.   Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore said the agency wouldmonitor prices, but said, &quot;We at DOE have no authority todictate prices, nor should we.&quot;   &quot;We do not have any price control system now,&quot; said Rep.Philip Sharp (D., Ind.), chairman of the House energysubcommittee who is convening a hearing into energy pricestoday. &quot;The president ought to be focusing on some jawboningwith the oil companies.&quot;   In response to reporters' questions yesterday, White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, &quot;It's not clear that all ofthe increases that have been reported at the consumer levelare necessary, and we would certainly urge . . . allcompanies not to be anticipatory.&quot;   Gasoline prices at service stations across the countryspurted almost as quickly as Iraqi troops moved into Kuwait.Prices jumped an additional seven cents a gallon over theweekend, bringing the four-day average national increase to11 cents since Mideast hosilities put oil markets in turmoil.   The average price for regular unleaded climbed to $1.186 agallon, according to a spot check of 1,400 service stationsby the American Automobile Association. While the increaseswere across the board, California may have the biggestadvances, with prices up 12 to 15 cents.   Gasoline price-increases are being initiated at all pointsin the supply chain, from refiners to wholesalers to cornerstations, in step with soaring commodity market quotes. Moreincreases may be in store; gasoline futures on the New YorkMercantile Exchange rose more than nine cents a gallonyesterday.   The supply of gasoline hasn't significantly changed, andmuch of the fuel currently for sale has been in inventory.But oil experts say that when Iraq invaded Kuwait last week,the same nervousness about possible supply disruptions thattouched off panicky crude-oil buying also hit gasolinemarkets, leading to the rise in pump prices.   Like many consumers, members of Congress complained thatthe prices moved before the events in the Middle East had anyimpact on U.S. oil supplies.   But the day-to-day price of oil -- and even of gasolineand other refined products -- is heavily influenced byfutures-market traders who buy and sell contracts onspeculation about future price moves. When prices are rising,the changes often hit the gasoline pump immediately becausewholesalers and retailers have the ability to sell theirsupplies through exchanges at the futures-market price.   &quot;There's no conspiracy,&quot; said Philip Verlanger of theInstitute for International Economics, a Washington thinktank. &quot;It is the market at work.&quot;   Nevertheless, House and Senate committees called hearingsfor today into energy prices, and there was congressionalpressure on the Bush administration to tap the U.S. strategicpetroleum reserve. More than two dozen senators signed aletter to President Bush asking him to convene a specialfederal task force to monitor gasoline prices and recommend aresponse.   &quot;Across the board, the big oil companies have gone on afeeding frenzy,&quot; said Sen. Richard Bryan (D., Nev.), chairmanof the Senate consumer subcommittee, which also scheduled ahearing for today. &quot;This isn't panic. This is greed.&quot;   But Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D., Conn.), who spent yearsbattling oil companies when he was attorney general inConnecticut, acknowledged yesterday that the government'slegal options &quot;are not enormous.&quot; Besides a JusticeDepartment antitrust investigation, the Federal TradeCommission could investigate unfair trade practices.   Although there has been a surplus of oil in world markets,the Energy Department said that at last tally, U.S. gasolinestocks were &quot;slightly below the lower limit of the averagerange for the last three years.&quot; As of July 27, the nationhad 217.8 million barrels of gasoline on hand, 10.1% belowthe same date last year.   ---   Caleb Solomon in Houston contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
