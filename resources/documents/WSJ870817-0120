When Mr. Hamdoon arrived in 1983, Iraq didn't have diplomatic relations with the U.S., and a lot of Americans, angry at the Iraqis' support for terrorism and their hostility toward Israel, thought things should stay that way. Mr. Hamdoon, an operative in Iraq's ruling Ba'ath party who spoke halting English and had never served in an Iraqi embassy, didn't seem likely to change much.    Yet diplomatic ties were re-established in 1984. Washington is now openly guaranteeing export credits for Iraq and more quietly providing it with intelligence help for its war effort. The clearest U.S. tilt toward Iraq in the seven-year war has come in protecting tankers of its critical ally, Kuwait. Despite U.S. arms sales to Baghdad's enemy Iran and the Iraqi attack on the USS Stark, bilateral relations have never been better.    The dapper, dignified and deeply serious Iraqi ambassador didn't turn around relations by himself. U.S. animosity toward Iran helped, as did his own country's decision to reduce support for terrorists. But experts say his clever maneuvering and creative public diplomacy in forums ranging from network television to American high schools has allowed Baghdad to maximize the gains of wooing the U.S.    &quot;Nizar did quite a remarkable job of seizing the opportunity of improved relations and building a base of support in a town very unfriendly to Iraqis when he arrived,&quot; says William Quandt of the Brookings Institution.    &quot;I have been an architect in Washington,&quot; says the 43-year-old Mr. Hamdoon, who will be replaced by Iraq's current ambassador to London, Abdul al-Anbari, when he returns to Baghdad next month to become the foreign minister's deputy. &quot;We had to build a structure of relations from the floor up.&quot;    Iraq has won new friends even among pro-Israeli members of Congress and administration officials, who are frequent guests at the ambassador's lively dinner table.    &quot;Hamdoon is the most astute and adept Arab ambassador in town,&quot; says Richard Strauss, the pro-Israeli editor of the Middle East Policy Survey, one of the ambassador's recent dinner guests. &quot;He's made people sit up and realize that foreigners other than those who have a constituency in this country can operate effectively if they play the game right.&quot;    There are 154 embassies in Washington. They struggle to figure out how government decisions are made and to compete for influence and visibility. Mr. Hamdoon says the secret of his success is simple.    &quot;My first advice to any ambassador here is don't spend more than five percent of your time with the administration,&quot; he says. &quot;There are limits to its power. Anything you agree to with the administration, despite any guarantees, means nothing if Congress and public opinion are not with you.&quot;    Mr. Hamdoon hence travels regularly. He answered questions for three hours at Prince George High School in Richmond, Va., in June, and he'll woo business executives and academics in Indianapolis today at the Hudson Institute. He tries to visit at least five congressmen a week. He is readily accessible to journalists. On the day after Iraqi planes inadvertently fired upon the USS Stark, killing 37 American sailors, he had only one official meeting at the State Department and 15 television interviews.    Iraq also responded cleverly to news of U.S. arms sales to Iran. Instead of withdrawing Mr. Hamdoon in protest, it kept him on to capitalize on the public outrage.    &quot;If you leave the scene open, who is going to put forward Iraq's point of view?&quot; the ambassador asks.    One of Mr. Hamdoon's hallmarks has been his open wooing of pro-Israeli Washington figures -- although he insists that he remains clear of Israeli diplomats. He has given dinners in honor of National Security Council aide Peter Rodman and New York Rep. Stephen Solarz, both known in Washington as friends of Israel. Mr. Solarz this month will make his second trip to Iraq arranged by Mr. Hamdoon, during which he is likely to meet with President Saddam Hussein.    State Department officials say Mr. Hamdoon realized early on that U.S. policy toward the Middle East is shaped in large part by this group and to ignore them was counterproductive.    &quot;A pro-Israeli American is still an American,&quot; Ambassador Hamdoon says simply. &quot;I always believe in dialogue. Congressman Solarz listens to us and we listen to him.&quot; Rep. Solarz recently sponsored a bill that very much pleased Iraq, calling for a cease-fire in terms that focused attention on Iran's intransigence.    A large part of Mr. Hamdoon's success, however, has nothing to do with how he handles Washington. As a prominent member of the ruling Ba'ath party who is close to both President Saddam Hussein and Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, he understands the thinking of his superiors and enjoys their confidence. He is thought to be behind his government's uncharacteristic openness in inviting Americans to investigate the Stark attack.    &quot;I know what they want and the way they think in Baghdad,&quot; he says. &quot;If you don't have the confidence and support of your government, you can't initiate anything.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
