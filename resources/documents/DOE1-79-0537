One purpose of the system liesin unification of the data of flow rate, water temperature, topography,geology, and so on which were independently measured and utilized conventionally.This system can show a more clear relation between marine flow and contouror a structure, and realizes various survey of higher precision on hotwater discharge, fishing reefs, and so on. Also, the system is usefulin survey prior to marine work and in work control. In this paper, asan example, the practical survey and the data processing which were employedto examine the fundamental design and execution of the main towers ofthe AKashi Channel large bridge are described. Particularly, the realtime information is effective as fundamental information for variouscontrol during the execution. It has become possible to control the executionon a highest level.
