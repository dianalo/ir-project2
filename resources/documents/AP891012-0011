Bulger, chairman of the committee and president of theAssociation of Academic Health Centers.   ``In urban areas, this often means that low-income women havebeen hurt the most by the lack of providers,'' he said, but notedthat there is a ``serious shortage of obstetrical care'' in bothrural and inner areas.   He said health providers tend to avoid patients with high-riskpregnancies. These most often are the impoverished because theygenerally are more likely to smoke and have poor diets, both ofwhich increase the risks of having an imperfect child.   One result, he said, is that the United States ranks 19th in theworld in infant mortality and, by some measures, the statistics finfant death are getting worse.   ``In 1985, infant mortality for blacks and other non-whitesactually increased for the first time in 20 years,'' said Bulger.``While the causes for this increase are many, the inaccessibilityof care for poor women, a situation clearly made worse by liabilityconcerns, is an important factor.''   The committee, which includes doctors, lawyers and educators,suggested both short-term and long-term solutions. Immediateactions recommended were:   _State subsidies for medical liability premiums for obstetricalproviders who treat women on Medicaid.   _Reviving the National Health Service Corps. This would providemore loans for medical students who then would be obligated toserve in areas where physicians are in short supply.   For more permanent solutions, the committee recommended:   _State experiments with alternatives to the system of medicalliability. Possible models could include a no-fault compensationsystem for certain conditions, such as neurological impairment of anewborn. Also suggested were negotiated contracts between doctorand patient, and establishing in advance a system of bindingarbitration to settle disputes.   _Consideration of a plan by the American Medical Associationthat calls for an administrative processing of claims that woulddetermine fault, fix awards and discipline offenders.   The committee found that legal claims against obstetricians runtwo to three times higher than for other medical specialties, andthat juries are twice as likely to find for the plaintiff in caseswhere an obstetrician is the defendant.   ``It is easy to understand this situation, since most casesinvolve brain-damaged infants whose parents generally are withoutthe resources to provide for a lifetime of complex health care,''Bulger said.   Malpractice insurance premiums for obstetrics in some cities nowexceed $100,000 a year _ and sometimes the pro-rated cost perdelivery is higher than the Medicaid reimbursement for a normaldelivery, the committee found.   Members of the committee said they found a number ofmisperceptions on the part of both patients and baby doctors.   Dr. Arthur L. Herbst, chairman of the department of obstetricsat the Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Chicago, saidmany doctors mistakenly believe poor families are more apt to sueif there is a poor result from childbirth.   Another misperception, said Dr. Donald N. Medearis Jr.,professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, is thatobstetricians are to blame for all of the mental retardationproblems that occur in newborns.   ``We don't know what causes most mental retardation,'' he said.   The committee said the number of obstetrical care providers inrural areas has fallen by 20 percent over the last five years. Insome states, said Bulger, there are whole counties where there isno obstetrical care available.   Doctors' fear of liability is also contributing to an increasein the number of babies delivered by cesarean section, Herbst said.The committee said that 20 years ago, only one in 20 babies wasdelivered by the surgical procedure, but the rate in some areas nowis one in four babies.   The Institute of Medicine is chartered by the National Academyof Sciences. It is a private organization that acts as an advisorto the federal government and initiates research of its own.</TEXT></DOC>
