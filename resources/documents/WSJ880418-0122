The White House repeated Friday that it would veto the trade bill if it contained that provision, and in the past it has made clear that it sees the foreign-disclosure requirement, too, as veto bait.    Some Democrats, however, hoping to demonstrate their ability to override a veto, believe the provision could pick up votes for the entire bill. Alternately, some believe that even if the bill dies, they can score points with constituents by including a provision aimed at foreign investors.    Speaker Wright (D., Texas) late last week encouraged House conferees to work out a compromise with their Senate counterparts on the amendment, sponsored by Rep. John Bryant (D., Texas), which would require foreigners to disclose significant investments in the U.S.    Some senators, as well as the Reagan administration, fear that such a requirement would deter needed new investment in the U.S.    The House conferees have offered a compromise version that would require the government to study the need for more foreign-investment disclosure and turn over to Congress existing data on such investments collected by the administration.    Senate conferees so far have refused to agree to that compromise, but the issue remains open. The apparent inevitability of a veto might sway some senators who had opposed the amendment only because they wanted to produce a bill the president would sign.    &quot;This present bill with plant closings is dead,&quot; said Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.) yesterday on CBS-TV's &quot;Face the Nation.&quot; He said the congressional leadership's decision Thursday to keep the plant-closing provision was a &quot;decision to kill the bill.&quot;    But Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said yesterday, &quot;I hope the president will reconsider&quot; his veto threat, but concluded that the fate of the trade bill &quot;will come to an override.&quot;    The administration already has sounded out some lawmakers about upholding a presidential veto, according to one senior White House official, and is &quot;cautiously optimistic.&quot;    The message the president sends along with any veto could be critical in shaping Congress's next move if it couldn't manage an override, congressional sources said.    If Mr. Reagan were to say that he liked the legislation except for the plant-closing and foreign-investment provisions, Congress might drop those parts and send back a smaller package to the president.    If, however, Mr. Reagan were to say the bill was loaded with problems, Congress would be unlikely to work up another bill, and could stall approval of other legislation President Reagan really wants -- the U.S.-Canada trade agreement. </TEXT></DOC>
