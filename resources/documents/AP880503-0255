(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Farmers around the country are out kickingthe tires on new tractors again, and equipment sales are reboundingfrom post-Depression lows so quickly many manufacturers are havingtrouble keeping up.   ``The situation has changed dramatically,'' said DickUnverferth, president of Unverferth Manufacturing, a Kalida, Ohio,company that makes tillage and grain-handling equipment and specialfarm vehicle wheels.   ``It went from a pretty sick apple to one where we're onovertime and have been on overtime for quite a while,'' saidUnverferth, who heads the Farm Equipment Manufacturers Association,a 330-member trade group of small manufacturers.   While manufacturers anticipated an upswing with an improved farmeconomy, most misjudged its size and momentum.   ``I never thought things would turn around to this magnitudethis quickly,'' said Bud Fleischer, who runs a Columbus, Neb.,company that makes tillage and planting equipment.   ``I thought it would be a gradual turnaround, something youcould adjust to,'' he said. ``We went from moderate production toextremely heavy production.   ``Unless something happens to change things drastically in thenext six weeks, this could be a record year in sales for thiscompany,'' Fleischer said.   The sales spurt has left farmers waiting months for new tractorsand equipment as manufacturers attempt to fill an unexpectedbacklog of orders.   Steel has become a precious metal because of the manufacturingpush. Prices are up 20 percent to 45 percent for some tubing andsteel bars that are in short supply. Machinery makers also reportproblems getting bearings.   In addition to farmer income, factors propelling the surgeinclude a nearly depleted inventory of good used equipment, bettercommodity prices, stronger export sales of grain and a continuingmoderation of interest expenses and costs for fuel, fertilizer andother materials.   Farm Equipment and Industrial Institute monthly sales surveysshow a strong recovery. In March, manufacturers sold 9,876 tractorscompared with 7,712 the same month a year earlier. For the firstquarter of this year, 22,986 tractors have been sold compared with18,061 in the same period a year ago.   Sales of combines and hay and forage equipment also are upsharply in the first quarter.   After record or near-record sales in the late 1970s as farmersexpanded their operations, equipment manufacturers and dealers werehit hard when the farm recession began. During the early 1980s,many farmers quit buying new equipment and either made usedequipment purchases or just tried to get by with additionalmaintenance or repair.   Dozens of little companies that made specialized machineryfolded or scrambled to get into other product areas.   Even the big manufacturers were hard hit. A hallowed name inagricultural equipment for decades, International Harvester Co.,sold its farm machinery division to J.I. Case in 1984 so it couldconcentrate on making more profitable heavy trucks.   At Deere andamp; Co., the No. 1 ag equipment maker in the UnitedStates, farm machinery sales peaked in 1981. When they begandeclining, company profits followed. In fiscal 1986, Deere lost$229 million, its first loss since the Great Depression.   As the slump bottomed out, sales and manufacturing capacitydipped to around 50 percent of previous levels, said JamesEbbinghaus, vice president of the Farm and Industrial EquipmentInstitute. The institute represents large manufacturers who providemore than 90 percent of all the farm equipment and machinery madenationwide.   ``About a year ago things started to turn around,'' Ebbinghaussaid. ``Sales stopped their decline and leveled off or started backup.''   He said by the end of 1987, early-year losses had been recoupedand the industry stood about even with its position at the end of1986.   U.S. Department of Agriculture economists are predicting amodest increase in sales during 1988.   ``The big news is there isn't expected to be a decline for thefirst time in several years,'' said Stan Daberkow, a USDA EconomicResearch Service economist.   Preliminary USDA statistics show 1987 was the eighth consecutiveyear of declining farm equipment expenditures. But when finalfigures are released in July, they are expected to show a lesssevere decrease than in previous years, Daberkow said.   He and other ag economists say the improvement in net farm cashincome _ the difference between gross income and expenses _ finallyis affecting equipment sales. For two years or more, farmers whosaw their incomes improve have used the money to pay off debts,most economists agree.   The outlook of many farmers began changing about eight monthsago, according to economists and other equipment industry analysts.   ``It's as positive now as it's been in a long period of time,''Ebbinghaus said.   Deere andamp; Co. broke a string of five straight quarterly losses inthe second quarter of fiscal 1987. The company hasn't had a losingquarter since and it has been calling back laid-off workers.   ``We expect the recovery to continue,'' said Deere spokesmanBrian Alm. ``We have what we call `cautious optimism.' We've beenthrough so much for so long we almost don't want to get too excitedtoo soon.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions May 7-8</NOTE></DOC>
