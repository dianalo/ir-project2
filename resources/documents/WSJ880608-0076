The nation's cities employed 25,441 corrections workers in October 1986, up from 17,945 five years earlier, for an annual increase of 7.2%, the bureau said in its annual study of city employment.    Many cities have been finding they need bigger, better corrections facilities, while others seem to be taking on prisoners held by county systems, said Betty P. Stark, a Census Bureau statistician.    A Justice Department study put the nation's jail population at 274,444 as of mid-1986, a 23% rise in three years. At that time, the most recent period for which detailed figures are available, nearly one-fourth of the jails were under court order to reduce populations because of overcrowding.    City and county jails are increasingly being used to handle spillover from crowded state prison systems, the Justice Department said.    Although corrections was up sharply, the total number of people working for city governments edged up a slight 0.2% annually during the five years, to 2.49 million from 2.47 million. A record 2.56 million workers were counted in 1980.    Payrolls for October 1986 totaled $4.40 billion, up from $3.22 billion in the same month five years earlier. That represented an increase in average monthly earnings to $2,065 from $1,529.    After corrections, the next fastest-growing segment of city employees was librarians, which grew 5.2% annually over five years, rising to 42,961 from 33,402.    Public welfare workers and health workers each grew 3.4% annually, while air transport employees rose 3.2%.    On the other hand there was a drop of 15.7% a year in college teachers and a nearly 1% annual decline in school teachers. Only a small share of cities operate their own schools and colleges.    A major factor in this decline was the transfer to state control in 1983 of colleges operated by the cities of New York and Cincinnati. In the same year the Newark, N.J., school system was switched from city operation to a special district.    Here is a rundown of the number of city government workers in various major government functions, and the annual rate of change between 1981 and 1986:                                   Workers         % Chng    Corrections .................. 25,442          +  7.2    Libraries .................... 42,961          +  5.2    Health ....................... 34,277          +  3.4    Welfare ...................... 49,752          +  3.4    Air Trnspt ................... 12,911          +  3.2    Sewerage ..................... 66,891          +  2.4    Parks-Rec. .................. 111,975          +  2.2    Electric ..................... 49,597          +  2.0    Transit ...................... 70,108          +  2.0    Housing ...................... 45,576          +  1.9    Highways .................... 127,334          +  1.8    Police ...................... 391,239          +  1.4    Water ........................ 99,160          +  1.4    Gas ........................... 7,161          +  1.3    Finances ..................... 71,461          +  1.0    Admin ....................... 113,134          +  0.3    Fire ........................ 193,560          +  0.3    Schools ..................... 312,007          -  0.9    Hospitals ................... 123,888          -  1.0    Sanitation ................... 92,168          -  1.2    Water Trnspt .................. 2,548          -  1.8    Colleges ...................... 8,138          - 15.7</TEXT></DOC>
