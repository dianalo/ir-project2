It was unclear how many soldiers were taking part in theinsurrection, and there were no reports of gunfire or injuries byearly afternoon. The Campo de Mayo base was the fourth militaryoutpost reporting unrest in two days.   The army sent loyal troops to the base and reported other basesnationwide were calm. Vice President Victor Martinez convenedemergency meetings to discuss the rebellion with Cabinet ministersand military chiefs.   Alfonsin is in New York to address the U.N. General Assembly.   The rebel officer, who identified himself only as an aide to Col.Mohamed Ali Seineldin, said the revolt was not against Alfonsingovernment.   ``Our posture is one of absolute respect for the Constitution,''he said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. He saidthe rebellion was aimed at toppling the army chief, Gen. Jose DanteCaridi.   Seineldin ``is raising arms against the authorities of the forcein a definitive attempt to restore the honor of the army and itshistoric role,'' the officer said from the base, 20 miles northeastof Buenos Aires.   The insurrection followed incidents Thursday in which 53 coastguard men armed themselves and deserted their base and an captainattempted to incite infantry troops at La Tablada, west of BuenosAires. The Defense Ministry said the captain was arrested.   Government officials had believed those incidents, and anotherfailed uprising at an army communications facility in City Bell, 25miles south of the capital, had been isolated.   Today they were treating the Campo de Mayo revolt as part of thesame unrest and trying to make sure there were no other pockets ofdissent.   The elite coast guard unit on Thursday deserted their base inthree trucks, into which they loaded four light machine guns, 200rifles, 30 handguns and 100,000 rounds of ammunition, officials said.   The Diario y Noticias news agency reported the coast guard unitwas inside the Campo de Mayo base today.   At the base, no clashes were reported, but rebels in combat gearput a heavy machine gun at the entrance to the military school andtook in weapons.   The military action was denounced on all sides.   ``No action of this type is capable of threatening democracy,''said Eduardo Angeloz, presidential candidate of Alfonsin's RadicalCivic Union.   Carlos Menem, the opposition Peronist Party candidate in the May1988 elections, said: ``If it were necessary, I don't doubt theArgentine people would mobilize in defense of democracy.''   Elements within the army have complained about Caridi'sleadership, the selection of officers for promotion and retirement,the military budget that under Alfonsin has shrunk by half, and paythat has not kept pace with 332 percent inflation.   Officers also are unhappy about the resumption of trials againstcolleagues charged with human rights abuses in the crackdown onleftist subversion during the 1976-83 dictatorship.   The 1987 and 1988 uprisings led by Lt. Col. Aldo Rico, nowdischarged and imprisoned, were motivated to support fellow officersbeing prosecuted in civilian courts, and reflected the unwillingnessof colleagues who were called to testify.   During the dictatorship, kidnappings, bombings and assassinationsby leftist groups were curtailed, but at least 9,000 Argentines``disappeared'' and were presumed executed by security forces, agovernment commission reported.   In December 1985, five former junta members, including formermilitary presidents Jorge Videla and Roberto Viola, were convictedin civilian court for crimes including kidnapping, torture andmurder.</TEXT></DOC>
