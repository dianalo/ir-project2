The talks, which broke down in London last week, concernwhether UAL Corp.'s United and AMR Corp.'s American Airlineswill be allowed to replace Pan American World Airways andTrans World Airlines at Heathrow. United has agreed to pay$290 million for Pan Am's London routes, subject to approvalfrom the U.S. Transportation Department. But Pan Am, which isoperating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection, won'tget the money until the British government also clears thedeal.   American Airlines wants to buy several London routes fromTWA for $445 million, also subject to U.S. governmentapproval. TWA says the sale is &quot;essential if TWA is to avoidPan Am's fate.&quot; U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinnerhas warned that the deadlock could force Pan Am and TWA outof business.   One point Britain wants addressed is access to non-hubU.S. airports. British airlines, the official said, &quot;can'tget access to the substantial market for travel within theAmerican hinterland.&quot;                                                                                                          CHINA'S LOTTERY                                                                                                          China, which officially brands gambling as an evil, hassold $244 million of lottery tickets since the game of chancewas launched three years ago, the Beijing-funded China NewsService said. A total of $96.15 million from the proceeds wasused for social-welfare programs, the China Social WelfareLottery Committee was quoted as saying. The government-runlottery, which can be played in most of China, is the onlyofficial method to raise funds to finance more than 5,000social-welfare services and subsidize some 500 social-welfareorganizations, CNS said.                                                                                                          LAND OWNERSHIP IN BULGARIA                                                                                                          Bulgaria's Parliament gave preliminary approval to a lawpermitting private ownership of farmland after decades offorced collectivization. Under the new law, to be enactedafter some amendments and a second reading, arable land canbe owned by individuals, the state and communities as well ascooperatives.                                                                                                          HELP FOR FRENCH INDUSTRY                                                                                                          The French Industry Ministry is looking at ways to supportflagging industrial sectors, ministry officials said. Butthey stressed that the measures, which are still in the earlystudy phase, are likely to be more on the order of advice andtechnical assistance to businesses than direct monetarysubsidies. A ministry official denied that the government isplanning to institute a subsidy program for flaggingindustries such as automobiles, computers, or textiles.                                                                                                          FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN PORTUGAL                                                                                                          Direct foreign investment in Portugal reached a record508.9 billion escudos ($3.88 billion) last year. The figuresshow a 45.6% rise from 1989, continuing a four-year boom. Theforeign-investment expansion started in 1986, when Portugalbecame the 12th member of the European Community. The figuresshowed that Britain was Portugal's biggest investor, withGermany in second place.                                                                                                          NEW STEP FOR ROMANIA                                                                                                          The Council of Europe granted Romania observer status,asserting the country has made progress toward democracy.Romania became the seventh of the former East bloc countriesto affiliate itself with the council, best known as Europe'shuman-rights watchdog. It was turned down in its first bid tobe an observer last fall because of concerns about thecountry's slow progress toward democracy. A council officialnoted that it was illogical to allow the Soviet Union, whichwas given observer status last year, to be an observer butnot Romania.                                                                                                          EC FARM PLAN DRAWS HEAT                                                                                                          Britain, the Netherlands and Denmark, the EuropeanCommunity's firmest backers of a far-reaching global tradeaccord on agriculture, are expected today to criticize plansfor overhauling the EC's own farm-subsidy program.   EC agriculture ministers are due to discuss guidelinesadopted last week by the EC Commission for revamping thecostly Common Agricultural Policy. The commission hopes theplans will help unblock global trade talks, which collapsedat the end of last year, by convincing trade partners that itis serious about cutting subsidies.   But given the stiff resistance expected from many ECgovernments, it's unclear whether the commission will be ableto deliver anything near the broad changes outlined lastweek. Opponents fear the commission outlines would penalizelarge, efficient producers the most.   Among other things, the commission wants to shiftsubsidies away from production supports toward direct incomeaids and slash the guaranteed prices paid to farmers.

An increasing number of young people in Vietnam's ruralareas are marrying at age 15 or 16 despite governmentprograms urging them to wait until the legal age of 18, thearmy newspaper Quan Doi Nhan Dan said. . . . More than 2,500Malaysian Muslims have volunteered to go to Iraq to help inrelief work, a senior official of the opposition PanMalaysian Islamic Party was quoted as saying by a Japanesenews agency. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has appealed toMalaysians not to take sides in the Gulf war.</TEXT></DOC>
