The plan, adopted by the House Ways and Means public assistance subcommittee on a 9-2 vote, would provide benefits costing about a third more than those proposed by the Reagan administration. The proposal, however, doesn't increase premiums as much as the White House plan. The subcommittee would make up the difference with the tax increase.    The panel's catastrophic health plan was offered by Reps. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.) and Willis Gradison (R., Ohio), the chairman and ranking Republican, respectively. Under their proposal, Medicare recipients generally wouldn't have to pay more than about $1,700 annually for medical costs, compared with $2,000 under the administration plan developed by Health and Human Services Secretary Otis Bowen.    Under the panel's proposal, people with annual incomes between $20,000 and $30,000 -- more than one third of the nation's old people -- would pay an additional $266 in income taxes to finance the increased coverage. Those with incomes in the $30,000-to-$50,000 range would face a tax increase of almost $497. About 54% of the elderly would face no tax increase at all, according to the subcommittee.    Because premiums by law must cover 25% of the per-capita cost of Medicare's medical insurance program, they would rise $15.60 to $279.60 annually under the Stark-Gradison bill from the $264 recipients are scheduled to pay after Oct. 1, according to a subcommittee estimate.    Dr. Bowen's plan, in contrast, wouldn't raise taxes. But it would increase the annual premium about $73, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates.    &quot;We've come up with an innovative funding mechanism that provides cost-effective protection to all, while establishing the principle that those who have more should pay more,&quot; Mr. Stark said in a statement on the subcommittee bill.    The panel's proposed funding mechanism may face difficulty in the full Ways and Means Committee when it considers the catastrophic measure after Easter recess. The subcommittee adopted the financing structure by a narrow 6-5 vote, with two Democrats voting with the minority.    &quot;I don't think many members of Congress campaigned on the promise they would place a new income tax on people over 65,&quot; said John Bender, an aide to Rep. J.J. Pickle of Texas, one of two Democrats opposing the financing plan. </TEXT></DOC>
