Bill Buckley died on June 3, 1985, and theworld stood silent.   ``On April 17, 1986, American Peter Kilborn and two Britishhostages were executed in retaliation for the U.S. raid on Libya.Americans applauded this hostile act, and the families of thehostages buried their dead. In 1987, French hostage Michel Seuratbecame so ill that he was reduced to crawling on his hands and kneesto use the toilet. He died before the horrified eyes of his fellowhostages, and once again the world stood silent.   ``Today, we know that of the nine American hostages being held,one has gone mad and another has twice attempted suicide. Twohostages tried to escape and were beaten senseless by their captors.Terry Anderson has pounded his head against the dirty, stone wall ofhis cell until the blood ran. Frustrated, angry, lonely and tired ofbeing caged like an animal, he finally broke.   ``How long will America stand silent in the face of thisabomination? How long will their fellow Americans debate and discusswhat, if anything, should be done to free these innocent men whilethey waste away and some go mad and some die and we still continueto debate and discuss.   ``This is not or should not be a political issue. This is a humanrights issue, a humanitarian concern, a crime against humanity inthe words of (U.N. Secretary-General Javier) Perez de Cuellar andstill we discuss and debate and some die and some go mad.   ``Enough is enough I say. No more debate. No more discussion. Ourmessage to their captors, to President Bush and to the world must bethat simple: Enough is enough. In the words of Terry Anderson, thiscannot continue. I say again: This cannot continue. Enough, forGod's sake, enough.''</TEXT></DOC>
