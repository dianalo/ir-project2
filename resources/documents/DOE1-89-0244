Plants ofPicea abies were fumigated with sulfur dioxide in a special cabinet,and the sulfur content of the needles was analyzed. Exposure to SO{sub2} caused the accumulation of large amounts of sulfate-S. The incorporationof S into organic compounds lagged behind the deposition of SO{sub 4}-S{sub2} and seems to depend on the developmental age and the concentrationof sulfur dioxide.</TEXT></DOC>
