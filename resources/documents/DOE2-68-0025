<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-68-0025 </DOCNO><TEXT>Natural gas steam reforming today covers more than 70% of synthesis gasproduction. The gas specific consumption has been largely improved duringthe last thirty years. It has now reached 32 GJ/metric ton of NH/sub3/ on HHV, from 45 in the sixties. Ammonia is still the major user ofsynthesis gas. The successive improvements are: thermal energy recoveryfrom the combustion gases at the outlet of the tubular reformer, whereonly 40% of the energy input is absorbed by the endothermal reaction;better quality of the reforming and conversion catalysts; better CO/sub2/ removal processes; improved catalyst for ammonia and methanol synthesisand recovery of the H/sub 2/ from the purge gas. One of these processeshas been successfully experimented. It involves the suppression of thetubular steam reforming, replaced by a simpler autothermal catalyticreactor and the new REGATE reheater of reactant gases to 1500{sup 0}Cunder pressure (air + steam for NH/sub 3/, recycled gas + steam for H/sub2/ and CH/sub 3/OH). No oxygen is needed. The system is simpler, moreefficient (27,0 GJ/metric ton of NH/sub 3/ HHV) and safer.</TEXT></DOC>
