The buyout is being formed by Adler andamp; Shaykin, a New York investment firm that specializes in leveraged buyouts. Under the plan, which was one of several offers Joy's board considered, a newly formed company will make a $35-a-share tender offer for as much as 94.3% of the company's 17.7 million shares outstanding.    A. William Calder, Joy's chairman, president and chief executive officer, called Pullman-Peabody's latest offer &quot;inadequate,&quot; but added that the Princeton, N.J.-based supplier of material-handling and food service equipment nevertheless had &quot;opened the Pandora's box&quot; that led to the buyout proposal. Joy is a maker of oil field and petroleum equipment and coal-mining machinery.    Pullman-Peabody's chairman and chief executive, Thomas M. Begel, declined to comment on Joy's plan to go private. Mr. Begel said he hadn't yet seen details of the plan and that Pullman-Peabody will &quot;consider all options and take the appropriate action&quot; after examining the information.    Joy's board previously rejected Pullman-Peabody's earlier $31-a-share offer and said it was weighing selling the company, possibly through a leveraged buyout. Pullman-Peabody recently paid about $18 million for 750,000 Joy shares, representing a 4.2% stake.    In an interview, Mr. Calder said Joy directors also considered separate employee-led and management-led leveraged buyouts, as well as several &quot;actual hard proposals&quot; to acquire Joy from several other companies that he wouldn't identify.    As part of the buyout, Ecolaire Inc., a Malvern, Pa.-based maker of machinery for the utility, incineration and industrial process industries, will be merged into the new company. Ecolaire, which was taken private in a leveraged buyout also formed by Adler andamp; Shaykin, is headed by a former Joy executive.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Joy's stock jumped $2.125 to close at $34.625 on volume on 1.2 million shares.    Pullman-Peabody launched a $31-a-share tender offer Dec. 2, which is scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m. EST Dec. 31. Pullman-Peabody had set a deadline of Friday for Joy's board to respond to its sweetened $34-a-share bid. Joy said that Adler andamp; Shaykin's offer will begin &quot;within the next few days.&quot;    In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors takes a company private in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of assets.    Although Joy said &quot;certain members&quot; of its current senior management will be offered an equity participation in the new company, it was unclear whether senior executives would stay on. &quot;Present management as a group is intended to stay in place,&quot; said Mr. Calder, who is 63 years old, adding &quot;I would like to stay, but that hasn't been decided.&quot;    Joy said Roy Wennerholm Jr., Ecolaire's chairman, president and chief executive officer -- and former head of Joy's environmental systems group -- will become its new chairman and chief executive after the buyout is completed.    Mr. Calder said Joy likely will sell its ailing petroleum equipment and products unit following the buyout to reduce debt. Through the fourth quarter ended Sept. 27, Joy's petroleum unit had incurred an operating loss in all but one of the past 16 quarters, and was largely responsible for an $83 million charge the company took in the quarter. In fiscal 1986, Joy had a net loss of $83.9 million, including the charge, on sales of $692.8 million.    Mr. Calder said &quot;several people,&quot; whom he wouldn't identify, have expressed an interest in Joy's petroleum unit. He added that First Boston Corp., Joy's investment banker, had received &quot;overtures for some of (Joy's) other businesses,&quot; which include air machinery and air pollution control equipment.    Joy said the company being formed to actually make the buyout, Joy Acquisition Corp., has received &quot;firm commitments&quot; for all of the needed financing. Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. and Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. have committed to provide $225 million of so-called bridge financing, while Citicorp's Citibank unit has committed to provide as much as $450 million of senior bank financing. A bridge loan is a short-term loan that is repaid through the later sale of debt securities by the borrower. Joy said the balance of the debt and a portion of the equity financing will be provided by the Equitable Capital Management Corp. unit of Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S.    Under the buyout proposal, if the offer is fully subscribed holders of the remaining 5.7% of Joy's shares will get preferred stock in Joy Acquisition Corp. designed to have a market value of $35 a share. If the tender offer isn't fully subscribed, holders will receive a combination of cash and preferred stock, on a pro rata basis, with a total value of $35 a share. Joy said First Boston and Kidder, Peabody will set the terms of the preferred stock.    As part of the proposed buyout, Joy also will redeem all the rights outstanding under its shareholder rights plan for five cents each. </TEXT></DOC>
