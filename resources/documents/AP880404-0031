Newly declassified documents, mostly Carter-era CIA and StateDepartment memos, provide the first detailed account of PresidentCarter's efforts to extricate the hostages before the 1980election, which Ronald Reagan won by a landslide, The Miami Heraldreported Sunday.   The documents were turned over to Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich,chairman of the House Judiciary criminal justice subcommittee, aspart of his investigation into whether Reagan's 1980 campaign madea secret arms-for-hostages deal with Iran.   Under the Reagan administration, the U.S. sold arms to Iran inexchange for the release of American hostages held in Lebanon.Funds from the sale were diverted to Contra rebels at a time whensuch aid was banned by Congress.   President Carter considered offering $10 million in militaryspare parts for the 52 Americans held hostage at the U.S. Embassyin Tehran, according to the Herald.   However, his administration backed away from the plan afterdeciding that arms dealer Houshang Lavi did not have the backing ofAbolhassan Bani-Sadr, then president of Iran, the newspaperreported.   Lavi, an Iranian-born resident of Long Island, N.Y., becameinvolved with the Carter administration after first contacting thecampaign of independent presidential candidate John Anderson. Thedocuments gave no indication whether the Reagan campaign wasapproached.   The papers include CIA memos to Carter's National SecurityCouncil chief David Aaron and State Department memos by then-deputyassistant secretary Harold Saunders.   One of the CIA memos dated Oct. 3, 1980, mentioned aconversation between an unidentified agency officer and Lavi inwhich Lavi offered to make the hostage exchange and handed over a aseven-page list of F-14 parts.   Lavi ``wished to arrange the delivery to Iran of $8 to $10million of F-14 spare parts,'' the memo said, adding he ``wouldarrange the swap of all the hostages upon the delivery of the spareparts'' and U.S. agreement to unfreeze Iranian assets, forgiveclaims against Iran and stay out of internal Iranian affairs.   The CIA officer recommended against pursuing the offer.   The memos indicate Carter officials ended contacts with Lavi onOct. 19, 1980, after a foreign ambassador in Tehran reported thatBani-Sadr had not been aware of Lavi's offer.   WLS-TV in Chicago reported on Oct. 15, 1980, thatarms-for-hostages talks were under way, and a 1984 congressionalinvestigation concluded the leak came from a ``highly placed memberof the U.S. intelligence community'' associated with the Reagancampaign.</TEXT></DOC>
