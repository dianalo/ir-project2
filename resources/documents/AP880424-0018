The threat was contained in a handwritten statement signed bythe Revolutionarey Justice Organization and delivered to the Beirutoffice of a Western news agency.   Revolutionary Justice holds Joseph James Cicippio, 57, of ValleyForge, Pennsylvania, and Edward Austin Tracy, 57, of Burlington,Vermont.   They are among the 22 foreign hostages held in Lebanon.   The conservative ad-Diyar newspaper reported earlier Sunday thata deal to free three French hostages held by another Shiite factionfell through when the kidnappers reneged on pledges to release thembecause the hijackers of a Kuwaiti airliner were still in Algiers.   Kuwaiti officials said when the Algerians negotiated an end tothe 16-day hijack drama Wednesday the Shiite hijackers left theplane on condition they were given safe passage to another country.   Sunday's Revolutionary Justice statement was accompanied by aphotograph of Cicippio, the acting comptroller at the AmericanUniversity of Beirut who was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986.   ``Any new (U.S.) aggression under any pretext or excuse willlead to the execution of spy Edward Tracy first and Cicippiosecondly,'' the Arabic-language statement said.   Another Western news agency received a photocopy of a membershipcard of an unidentified Lebanese organization bearing Tracy'sphotograph to authenticate the statement.   Tracy, a writer of children's books, was kidnapped Oct. 21, 1986.   ``The attacks occurring in the gulf will not go unpunished andwill not be as easy as America assumes and defines the beginningand the end of the aggression,'' the letter said.   The letter said that if U.S. attacks continued one option wouldbe to move ``the battle arena to inside America, after which thingswill get out of control.'' It did not elaborate.   The U.S. Navy disabled two Iranian frigates and sank or disabledfour other armed Iranian vessels in the Persian Gulf last Monday.   U.S. officials said the attack was in retaliation for the minestrike on an American Navy frigate that left 10 crewmembers injured.   President Reagan warned Saturday that further Iranian attacks onneutral shipping ``will be very costly to Iran and its people.''   U.S. officials have disclosed that American warships in the gulfwill now be allowed to go to the aid of neutral vessels underattack. Previously, the Navy was not permitted to intervene inraids on non-American vessels.</TEXT></DOC>
