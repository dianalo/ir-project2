(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two former White House aides runningfor Congress in California have turned to former Marine Lt. Col.Oliver North for tactical support.   North, who faces federal conspiracy charges for his role in theIran-Contra affair, on Wednesday urged the election of conservativeRepublican Dana Rohrabacher to represent the 42nd CongressionalDistrict.   It was his first campaign appearance since the Iran-Contrahearing last year, said Rohrabacher spokesman Robert Rule.Rohrabacher, a former speechwriter for President Reagan, is afriend from North's days as an aide to the National SecurityCouncil.   North was to campaign today for Christopher Cox, who is runningin the GOP primary for 40th Congressional District.   Cox, 35, of Newport Beach, was senior associate counsel forReagan from 1986 to this year, when he resigned to seek election.   North, speaking Wednesday to about 350 people in the hangarwhere Howard Hughes' mammoth Spruce Goose airplane is housed,repeatedly said that American freedoms were being stripped away,and urged greater support for the Nicaraguan Contras in their fightagainst that country's Sandinista government.   ``Congress decides to send Contras Band-Aids and donuts,'' Northsaid. ``That's their contribution to democracy, and that's not whatdemocracy is all about.''   North also said the conservative political movement is ``beingpicked apart, piece by piece, day after day, by a liberal Congresshell-bent on undoing this president's economical program andselling out freedom across the world.''   About $135,000 was raised for Rohrbacher, a former speechwriterfor Reagan, in several North appearances Wednesday, Rule said.   Protesters showed up at North events throughout the day.
