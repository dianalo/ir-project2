This method would be known as the``Streamlined Inspection System-Cattle'' (SIS-Cattle) when the system isoperated without a slaughter partial quality control (PQC) program or asthe ``Streamlined Inspection System/Partial Quality Control-Cattle'' (SIS/PQC-Cattle)when the system is operated in conjuncted with a slaughter PQC program.An approved slaughter PQC program would be required for establishmentsoperating at slaughter rates greater than 275 head per hour. The PQC programwould be optional for establishments that operate at slaughter rates of275 head per hour or less. This SIS inspection system would be implementedin all establishments that slaughter cattle (steers and heifers only) andhave an on-line staffing requirement of three inspectors or more.SIS-Cattle would incorporate modifications of the present cattle post-morteminspection procedure and combine viscera and carcass inspection stationsso that that inspection is completed at the viscera table. The proposedrule would also establish Finished Product Standards (FPS) for carcasses,heads and tongues and standards for other edible byproducts. The FPS programuses the cumulative sum (CUSUM) which is a statistical concept used bythe establishment and monitored by the inspector. Compliance is determinedbased on sample results collected over a period of time. These standardswould be used to evaluate the wholesomeness and acceptability of products.This proposed rule would also establish staffing standards for the inspectionof steers and heifers based on work measurement data and facility requirements.All establishments under the SIS system would be responsible for properhead, tongue, viscera, and carcass presentation. The operation of a PQCprogram for the presentation standards would be an option for SIS-Cattleestablishments. Establishments operating under SIS/PQC-Cattle would includepresentation standards in their PQC program.The SIS-Cattle system would also require establishment employees to palpateand present the tongue, incise the cheek muscles, and open the heart forinspection personnel.Additionally, the establishment would be responsible for the removal fromcarcasses of defects that are the result of the handling, slaughtering,or dressing operations and the removal of designated trimmable defectsas listed in the beef carcass finished product standards program.This system would provide an increase in slaughter method and personnelefficiency, as well as provide an increase in product yield, while stillproviding consumers with wholesome and otherwise unadulterated products.These gains have been demonstrated and documented in four pilot cattleestablishments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before: January 30, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Written comments should be sent in duplicate to the PolicyOffice, Attn: Linda Carey, FSIS Hearing Clerk, Room 3175, South AgricultureBuilding, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture,Washington, DC 20250 (see also ``Comments'' under <T2>Supplementary Information</T2>).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Dr. Douglas L.

It will not result in an annual effect on the economyof $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or prices for consumers,individual industries, Federal, State or local government agencies or geographicregions; or significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The principal effect of this proposed rule is to improve post-mortem inspectionprocedures for cattle which will result in maximum inspection efficiencyand increased productivity. Certain new requirements should be placed uponthe establishment; however, these requirements would be counterbalancedby the dollar gain resulting from the increased productivity.It is estimated that the cost of complying with these new requirementswould not exceed $40,000 per establishment. There are currently 55 operationswhich slaughter steers and heifers and require three or more inspectors.However, 24 of these operate in two shifts from a single facility. Therefore,the total number of facilities to be modified would be 43. As such, theestimated initial cost to industry for implementing the SIS-Cattle systemwould not exceed $2 million.Net productivity gains would offset the one-time cost of facility changes.It is estimated that an approximate 40 percent gain in productivity wouldresult because of an establishment's ability to increase its productionrate without requiring additional inspectors or inspection space. Fourpilot cattle establishments under this system have been able to show, bydocumented evidence, an increase in yield, an increase in control of production,and better supervisory control of employees. Under SIS/PQC-Cattle, establishmentsshould also realize further gains due to decreased product contamination,decreased trimming, increased shelf life of products, and other considerations.Actual monetary gain would depend upon the management practices at eachindividual establishment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effect on Small Entities</ITAG>The Administrator has determined that this proposed rule would not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesas defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Pub. L. 96-354 (5 U.S.C.601). SIS-Cattle is designed for slaughter establishments having threeor more inspectors. Specifically, this proposal would affect the approximately43 establishments which slaughter steers and heifers and require threeor more inspectors. Those establishments are not small entities. Establishmentshaving less than three inspectors would not be affected by this system.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Requirements</ITAG>This proposed rule would require establishments to perform finished productand edible byproduct testing. All establishments would be required to maintaincertain records to verify that the finished product standards and the ediblebyproduct standards have been met. This proposed rule would also requireestablishments operating under SIS/PQC-Cattle to develop and submit tothe Administrator for approval a PQC program designed to ensure that thedressed cattle carcasses are wholesome and properly prepared. Such establishmentswould be required to maintain certain records to fulfill their obligationunder the approved PQC programs. These requirements will be submitted tothe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under control number 0583-0015for approval (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)).<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning thisproposed rule. Written comments should be sent, in duplicate, to the PolicyOffice and should refer to the docket number appearing in the heading ofthis document. All comments submitted pursuant to this notice will be madeavailable for public inspection in the Policy Office between 9:00 and 4:00p.m., Monday through Friday.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The United States has had mandatory meat inspection for products preparedfor commerce since 1906. The Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C.601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) requires, among other provisions, that the Secretaryof Agriculture, through appointed inspectors, carry out a post-mortem examinationof the carcasses and parts of certain domesticated food animals, includingcattle, which are capable of use as human food when these animals are slaughteredin an official establishment that is subject to inspection under the Act.Post-mortem inspection involves an examination by one or more trained foodinspectors, under veterinary supervision, of the head, viscera, and otherparts of the carcass of each animal slaughtered, for the purpose of detectingdisease or other conditions that could cause the carcass or any part tobecome unfit for human food or otherwise adulterated.I. Traditional InspectionRoutine cattle post-mortem inspection has traditionally been performedat three points in the slaughter operation. Cervical (head) inspectionis conducted at an early point in the dressing operation; viscera inspectionis conducted after the carcass has been eviscerated; and carcass inspectionis conducted towards the end of the dressing operation. At each point,an inspector observes and palpates the carcass and its parts. For headand viscera inspection, an inspector also incises certain muscles, lymphnodes, and organs. The inspector examines the carcasses and directs andverifies establishment employees' performance of trimming operations. Thesetraditional procedures, which are outlined in the Meat and Poultry InspectionManual,1<NOTE/> have proven to be an effective method of inspection and havechanged little since the inception of Federal meat inspection in 1906.Since that time, however, there have been many significant changes in theway cattle are raised and moved to slaughter, in the types and frequencyof cattle diseases, and in the technology used to slaughter the animalsand dress their carcasses. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>1A copy of the Meat and Poultry Inspection Manual is on filein the office of the FSIS Hearing Clerk.The improved health of cattle today is largely the result of modern productionmethods. A large number of cattle are now bred and raised under controlledenvironments designed to promote growth and prevent disease. The controlleduse of various chemicals, antibiotics, and vaccines has improved the healthof cattle and decreased the number of these animals rejected as human food.Competitive pressures have produced many industry changes. Slaughter operationsare now located close to where the animals are grown, thus eliminatingarduous and costly shipment to slaughter. Also, the packing industry continuesto become more concentrated with less than 10 percent of the cattle abattoirsslaughtering more than 75 percent of the cattle. Furthermore, automationand technology have increased industry productivity and product uniformity.The inspection procedures for cattle carcasses have not kept pace withchanges in the livestock and meat industry. By ``modernizing'' cattle inspectionprocedures, FSIS would increase its inspection productivity while maintainingthe assurance of wholesomeness of cattle carcasses entering the Nation'sfood supply.In certain situations, the traditional cattle inspection procedures maylimit the rate at which an establishment slaughters animals and dressescarcasses. A redesigned system of cattle inspection would improve inspectionproductivity and allow faster line speeds for cattle slaughterers, thusproviding a means for increased efficiency.In 1982, FSIS implemented new swine post-mortem inspection procedures andstaffing standards which allowed higher production rates for swine operations(August 4, 1982, 47 FR 33673). The post-mortem inspection staffing standardsfor traditional cattle inspection were also revised at that time. Duringthat rulemaking procedure, FSIS announced that a new method for cattlepost-mortem inspection was being developed. FSIS has completed its developmentof the new method, called the Streamlined Inspection System-Cattle.II. The Streamlined Inspection System-CattleAs discussed earlier, under the traditional method of cattle inspection,inspectors are closely involved with the slaughter establishment's operations.In addition to examining each carcass for signs of disease, the inspectorsidentify and point out carcass dressing nonconformances and designatedtrimmable conditions to establishment workers, and direct them to ensurethat the defects have been properly removed. Dressing nonconformances arethose defects which occur on the carcass as a result of errors in the handling,slaughtering, or dressing operations performed by establishment employees.They include, but are not limited to, such things as bruises, hair, dirt,ingesta, organ remnants, and machine grease. Designated trimmable conditionsare those abnormal conditions that are not caused by improper dressingprocedures, that are readily identifiable, and that do not affect the dispositionof the carcass. They include, but are not limited to, fractures, arthritis,localized abscesses, and pigmentation. The identification and directingfor removal of these conditions have become a significant part of the inspectionjob and require 70-90 percent of carcass inspectors' time. These carcassdressing nonconformances and designated trimmable conditions are obviousand easily identifiable by a skilled person. Agency officials have concludedthat responsibility for controlling the dressing operation and removingobvious and readily identifiable carcass dressing nonconformances and designatedtrimmable conditions could be shifted to the establishment. This wouldallow inspectors to direct their efforts toward the detection of cattledisease conditions and enable the cattle industry to assume full responsibilityfor dressing operations.Since the greatest increase in inspector efficiency can be realized atthe higher slaughter rates, SIS-Cattle and SIS/PQC-Cattle would apply onlyto those establishments slaughtering steers and heifers with three or moreon-line inspectors. SIS-Cattle consists of a routine post-mortem inspectionprocedure whereby the inspector would focus on disease conditions and wholecarcass disposition, while the establishment employee would focus on controlof the dressing operations. For the purpose of monitoring the establishment'sremoval of dressing nonconformances and designated trimmable conditions,finished product standards for carcasses including tongues and heads, andstandards for other edible byproducts have been developed and includedin this proposal. Finished Products Standards (FPS) were tested and then validated by additionaltests in a number of establishments before the initation of SIS-Cattle.These establishments were operating under traditional inspection, whichis a carcass-by-carcass inspection. The standards are based on the averagequality of product produced following good manufacturing practices thatwere monitored using traditional inspection procedures. Historically, thisprocess has produced a product with a level of cleanliness that has beenconsidered aesthetically acceptable within the requirements of the FederalMeat Inspection Act. Therefore, Agency officals have concluded that whengood manufacturing practices are followed, a process that yields productsmeeting the FPS have an inherent level of cleanliness and are acceptable.Carcasses whose degrees of cleanliness are found to be within the actionlevel, are not injurious to health or othewise unfit for human food, andare therefore considered by the Agency not to be adulterated.The process of monitoring compliance with finished product standards willutilize the CUSUM statistical concept, which is defined as a statisticalmethod for comparing the output of a process against finished product standardsto determine compliance. The point at which product action is requiredis determined by an ``action'' number, ``subgroup absolute limit,'' or``subgroup maximum limit.'' The action number for this process was determinedby statistically weighing the test data results collected for NCIS.Tolerance number, start number, subgroup absolute limit, subgroup maximumlimit values and number of defects per sample were given values based onprofessional judgement of experienced veterinarians and other field personnelafter analyzing the test data. In determining these values, defects areweighted on the basis of public health significance or by how obvious thedefect was in terms of expected good manufacturing practice.The standards for edible byproducts were developed in response to a needrecognized by both industry and the Food Safety and Inspection Service(FSIS) for objective standards for such product. The Slaughter InspectionStandards and Procedures (SISP) Division of Technical Services collecteddata from randomly selected federally inspected establishments nationwideto determine the level of quality at which inspectors were accepting finishedbyproducts. The standards for edible byproducts were determined in thesame manner as for carcasses.A PQC program along with the SIS-Cattle system would be required in establishmentsthat slaughter cattle at rates greater than 275 head per hour. The velocityof the conveyer at speeds in excess of 275 head per hour has multiple effectson the slaughter operation as well as on the inspection operations. Successfulhigh speed operation require installation and maintenance of optimum facilities,close supervision of operators' techniques, and an aggressive, problem-solvingattitude by management personnel in order to produce carcasses and partswhich meet the FSIS finished product standards. A prevention-oriented processcontrol program is essential for the successful maintenance of a high speedoperation which routinely produces a wholesome product. Agency officialshave determined that establishments with speeds in excess of 275 head perhour must operate under a quality control program to ensure the uniformproduction of a wholesome, unadulterated product. The selection of a speedof 275 head per hour was based upon the results of interviews with experiencedfield veterinarians and FSIS supervisors, and the results of work measurementstudies. In their professional judgement, speeds above that rate requiredthe additional assurance afforded by a partial quality control program.The application of the finished product standards and the PQCA programwould be the responsibility of establishment employees and would be monitoredby inspectors to ensure the production of wholesome product.The provision for uniform presentation standards is a key element in thestreamlined inspection system. The presentation standards would have tobe met to ensure the effectiveness of inspection when the proposed staffingstandards are used. Presentation standards would be applied by inspectors,when not included in a PQC program. A separate PQC program for presentationwould be optional for establishments operating under the SIS-Cattle programat slaughter rates of 275 head per hour or less.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. The SIS-Cattle Post-Mortem Inspection Procedure</ITAG>A study comparing the effectiveness of the traditional procedure to thatof the proposed procedure was conducted in four establishments slaughteringsteers and heifers using the New Cattle Inspection System (NCIS), the forerunnerof SIS. FSIS evaluated a total of 28,800 samples_7,200 from each establishment(3,600 inspected by the traditional procedure and 3,600 by NCIS). An analysiswas made of the percentage of units that were free of errors. The resultsof the study showed that the inspection error rate with NCIS is equal to,or lower than, the inspection error rate with the traditional procedure.\2\<NOTE/> FSIS officials, using data obtained during the effectivenessstudy, determined that the procedures eliminated under the SIS inspectionsystem were not necessary to make an accurate disposition of cattle carcassesand parts.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ A report of this study is available upon request fromthe Slaughter Inspection Standards and Procedures Division, Technical Services,Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington,DC 20250 Area Code (202) 447-3219.In 1986 a feasibility study was performed using the NCIS with changed presentationrequirements for the head and heart. This new system was called the StreamlinedInspection System (SIS) for Cattle. Since there was no change in the inspectionprocedure, no additional testing was required. Now industry's presentationfor inspection must meet a minimum presentation standard to ensure thatthere is adequate time to perform inspection.1. Cervical (head) inspection. Under the traditional cervical inspectionprocedure, the inspector performs the following: (1) Observes the eyesand surfaces of the head; (2) incises the mandibular, parotid, lateralretropharyngeal (atlantal), and medial retropharyngeal (suprapharyngeal)lymph nodes; (3) incises the lateral and medial masticatory muscles (cheeks);and (4) observes and palpates the tongue.The SIS cervical inspection procedure would differ from the traditionalone in three principal ways. First, the new procedure would eliminate therequirement to incise the lateral retropharyngeal (atlantal) lymph nodes.Instead, the lateral retropharyngeal lymph nodes would be observed by inspectorsfor abnormalities. Second, the inspector would observe the masticatorymuscles only after an establishment employee presents the incised musclesfor inspection. Third, the inspector would observe the surfaces of eachtongue and routine palpation would be eliminated. In the development ofthe New Cattle Inspection System, it was determined that abnormalitiesfound in the tongue do not affect whole carcass disposition. This premisewas tested and documented in four test establishments and found to be valid.Therefore, as part of the routine dressing operation, an establishmentemployee would palpate each tongue for abnormalities prior to the cervicalinspection station and notify the cervical inspector of any abnormal findings.Thus, the palpation of tongues by establishment personnel is considereda sorting function only. The cervical inspector would then determine thesignificance of the findings and take appropriate action. These proceduresare monitored by inspection personnel who are not working on the line,such as the inspector in charge or an offal inspector. In addition, priorto chilling, all tongues would be subject to finished product standardsusing a statistically based sampling program.2. Viscera/carcass inspection. Carcass inspection would be performed togetherwith viscera inspection at the viscera/carcass inspection station.a. <T3>Viscera inspection</T3>. Under the traditional cattle inspection procedure,the inspector performing viscera inspection is required to: (1) observethe mesenteric lymph nodes, the abdominal viscera, the esophagus and spleen,and the ventral surfaces of the lungs; (2) observe and palpate the ruminoreticularjunction, the dorsal (costal) surfaces of the lungs, and the surfaces ofthe liver; and (3) incise and observe the tracheobronchial (bronchial)and mediastinal lymph nodes, the heart, the hepatic (portal) nodes, andthe bile duct.Under the SIS-Cattle inspection procedure, the viscera inspector wouldnot observe the ventral surfaces of the lungs, but would continue to observeand palpate the dorsal (costal) surfaces of the lungs. The SIS procedurewould eliminate the requirements to incise and observe the right tracheobronchial(bronchial) lymph node, to incise the heart, to incise the hepatic (portal)lymph nodes, and to palpate the ruminoreticular junction. The heart wouldbe inspected by observation only after an establishment employee presentsthe incised organ for inspection.b. <T3>Carcass inspection</T3>. The traditional carcass inspection procedureincludes palpation and observation of the superficial inguinal lymph nodesin the male or mammary (supramammary) lymph nodes in the female, medial(internal) iliac lymph nodes, diaphragm, and kidneys. Inspection also includesthe observation of the lumbar region, pillars of the diaphragm, peritoneum,pleura, cut surfaces of muscles and bones, and the exterior surface ofthe carcass.The SIS carcass inspection procedure would eliminate palpation of the diaphragm,superficial inguinal (mammary) lymph nodes, medial (internal) iliac lymphnodes, and kidneys. The procedure, however, would include the observationby the inspector of the diaphragm, lymph nodes, and kidneys. The inspectorwould not observe the split vertebral column and surrounding tissues.Under the SIS procedure, the inspector would observe the dorsal surfacesof the carcass with the aid of a large mirror strategically placed behindthe moving carcasses at the viscera station. The establishment would berequired to furnish adequate lighting for the mirror examination.In order to achieve maximum inspector efficiency at the lower speeds, thenew procedure would require the kidneys to be exposed and removed fromthe carcass for presentation along with the viscera at the viscera/carcassstation. An exception to the kidney removal requirement would be offeredto establishments slaughtering at rates greater than 234 per hour. Basedon work measurement studies, an additional inspector is required at a rateof 234 per hour. The work measurement study showed that kidney removaldid not improve inspector efficiency if the additional inspector was dedicatedto carcass and kidney inspection only.By combining viscera inspection and carcass inspection into a single viscera/carcassinspection station, FSIS would be able to maximize inspector efficiency.Also, the elimination of the traditional carcass inspection station wouldfacilitate the establishment's assumption of its responsibility for theidentification and removal of dressing nonconformances. Since inspectionwould be completed at the viscera/carcass inspection station, there wouldbe greater assurance that all carcass parts and organs are accurately identifiedwith the corresponding carcass throughout the dressing operation. Undertraditional inspection there is physical separation of the carcass andviscera after the viscera inspection station. An inspection decision atthe carcass station which might affect carcass disposition creates a logisticalpossibility of loss of identity of the viscera. Under SIS-Cattle, inspectionhas complete visual control of the viscera and carcass until inspectionis completed.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. The Slaughter Partial Quality Control (PQC) Program</ITAG>Recent field studies in selected pilot establishments have reinforced FSIS'long-standing view that Federal meat inspection is more efficient and effectivein establishments where the concepts of production control are practiced,in contrast to establishments which do not maintain the facilities, personnel,or procedures necessary to ensure control of their production operations.Establishments without production operation control tend to rely on theinspection service as a substitute for proper management and control oftheir operations. This subsequently requires Federal meat inspectors tocarry out quasi-supervisory functions that are inherently an establishment'sresponsibility. An establishment's PQC program would eliminate the needfor the inspection service to act in a quasi-supervisory role and wouldgreatly improve inspector efficiency.Under SIS-Cattle, establishments that operate at slaughter rates greaterthan 275 head per hour would be responsible for designing their own slaughterPQC program. The PQC program would be optional for establishments thatoperate at slaughter rates of 275 head per hour or less. The PQC program,developed by the establishment, would consist of three major elements:(1) Identification of points (generally known as critical control points)in the slaughter and dressing operation which are critical to the productionof carcasses in compliance with the finished product standards for dressedcattle carcasses; (2) development of certain standards at each controlpoint; and (3) specification of a series of predetermined actions to betaken if critical control point standards are not met. The last criticalpoint of each program would involve the examination of samples of finishedcarcasses, heads, tongues, and other edible byproducts to determine compliancewith the finished product standards program. The PQC program would furtherdefine how often each critical point is checked by the establishment andwould include a recordkeeping system.The establishment's PQC program would be submitted to and approved by theAdministrator under section 318.4 (9 CFR 318.4) of the Federal meat inspectionregulations and the requirements outlined in this document. The establishmentwould conduct the program, and FSIS would monitor the operation to ensurethat the provisions of the PQC program and regulations are met. FSIS' monitoringactivities would consist principally of reviewing critical control pointrecords and periodically sampling and examining products at the slaughterline critical control points to ensure the production of dressed carcasseswhich meet the finished product standards.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Presentation Program</ITAG>The provision for uniform presentation standards is a key element in thestreamlined inspection system. Presentation of the head, tongue, viscera,and carcass has traditionally been a responsibility of the establishmentbased on standards established by the inspector in charge. Uniform presentationis important in maintaining inspection efficiency and is critical at thehigher rates of slaughter. When the carcass or its parts are not uniformlypresented in a predetermined manner, time allotted for inspection mustbe used to correct or compensate for presentation errors. The adequacyof presentation, in turn, depends on such factors as disease conditions,establishment operating conditions, lighting, and facilities. FSIS hasdeveloped guidelines for the presentation of the head, tongue, viscera,and other parts of the carcass in official slaughter establishments.\3\<NOTE/> These guidelines provide objective criteria for determiningacceptable presentation and for reducing the line speeds when presentationis less than acceptable. These guidelines would be applied by FSIS as apart of SIS-Cattle. In the SIS/PQC-Cattle program, the guidelines wouldbe included in the establishment's PQC program which is monitored by FSIS.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\These guidelines are available for public inspection inthe office of the FSIS Hearing Clerk. Copies may be obtained free uponrequest from the Slaughter Inspection Standards and Procedures Division,Technical Services, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Departmentof Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250.III. Operational Requirements forthe Streamlined Inspection System-Cattle.There would be three areas of responsibility for an establishment underSIS-Cattle: (A) Inspection of the carcass, viscera and head, (B) equipment,facilities, and inspection space, and (C) removal of carcass and ediblebyproduct nonconformances. These responsibilities are described below alongwith a discussion of how they may affect the cattle industry.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Presentation of the Carcass and Its Parts For Inspection</ITAG>The primary difference between SIS-Cattle and SIS/PQC-Cattle is the partyresponsible for assuring proper presentation of the head, tongue, viscera,kidneys, and other parts of the carcass for inspection according to standardsset by FSIS.The presentation guidelines for establishments operating under SIS-Cattlewould be applied by FSIS. Establishments may request a PQC program forpresentation. If approved, the establishment would have the responsibilityof applying the guidelines with inspectors monitoring its application.Establishments operating under SIS/PQC-Cattle must include the presentationprogram in their PQC program and would be responsible for applying it.If post-mortem inspection cannot be performed at the current line speedunder SIS-Cattle or SIS/PQC-Cattle because of preparation of presentationdeficiencies or because of disease incidence, the inspector in charge wouldhave the authority to require the establishment to reduce speed and takeother corrective actions necessary for proper presentation for inspection.The following presentation standards are applicable to both SIS-Cattleand SIS/PQC-Cattle:<T3>1. Head and tongue presentation. </T3>Prior to the inspector's examinationof the tongues, an establishment employee would palpate the tongues andnotify the inspector if abnormalities were found. Notification to the inspectorwould be accomplished either directly or by means of a marking system developedby the establishment and acceptable to the inspector in charge, such astags, rings, cuts, or other markings. The inspector would visually inspectand incise the lymph nodes of each tongue and palpate any tongue identifiedas abnormal by the inspector or by an establishment employee on examination.A finished products standards program, which is statistically based, wouldbe applied to ensure that only wholesome tongues would pass. This procedureis as effective in detecting conditions relating to adulteration and wholesomenessas the current procedure. (See footnote 2 which refers to the study doneto validate this point.)Prior to the inspector's examination of the head, an establishment employeewould incise both lateral and medial masticatory muscles (cheeks) for inspection.The establishment would be responsible for assuring that the cheek muscleswere properly incised and presented for inspection.<T3>2. Viscera.</T3> An establishment employee would open all chambersof the heart and incise the interventricular septum before it reaches theinspector. The inspector would observe all surfaces of the heart for abnormalities.<T3>3. Carcass.</T3> The establishment would be required to spread thecarcasses at the viscera/carcass station so that carcass inspection couldbe performed.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Equipment, Facilities and Inspection Space</ITAG>The facilities required by SIS-Cattle for viscera/carcass inspection wouldinclude a mirror for viewing the dorsal surface of the carcass, additionallighting for the mirror, and lighting to adequately view the interior ofthe unsplit carcass at the combined viscera/carcass station. In addition,the space required to perform cervical (head) inspection would be basedon three interrelated variables: (1) The velocity of the head chain; (2)the number of heads presented per hour, and (3) the spacing between heads.In some establishments, the cumulative effect of these variables wouldrequire additional workspace to perform cervical inspection. Table 1 inandSection; 307.2(m) of this proposal supplies the maximum required workspacefor cervical inspectors when heads are spaced 4 feet apart. Additionaltables for head spacings of other than 4 feet will be available from theAgency. As discussed earlier, additional workspace may be needed in thoseestablishments where kidneys must be removed prior to the viscera/carcassinspection station. Most establishments should gain workspace as a resultof the removal of the inspector from the traditional carcass inspectionstation.<T3>1. Line speed indicator.</T3> A digital line speed indicator for boththe head chain and the evisceration chain would be required at a locationwhich is readily accessible to the inspector in charge. Knowledge of theline speeds is necessary to ensure that the inspection stations are properlystaffed.<T3>2. Mirror</T3>. For cattle slaughter lines with a moving top visceratable and requiring three or more inspectors as prescribed by the new staffingstandard, a one-piece, distortion-free, glass or plastic mirror would berequired. This mirror would be mounted and positioned, (i.e. angled ortilted) so the inspector may have a clear unobstructed view of the dorsalsurface of the carcass.<T3>3. Lighting.</T3> Shadow-free lighting with a minimum Color RenderingIndex (CRI) of 85 \4\<NOTE/> would be required at each inspection station. In addition,a diffuse light source (such as a double tube fluorescent light fixture)would be mounted at the top of the carcass mirror to provide adequate lightat the carcass shoulder level. Directional lighting would also be requiredat the viscera/carcass inspection station so that adequate light wouldbe provided inside the thoracic cavity of the carcass. This lighting wouldbe carefully adjusted so that it would pass through the relatively narrowopening in the ventral surface of the carcass lighting the sides and backof the cavity in sequence.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ This requirement may be met by using deluxe cool whiteor high intensity fluorescent type lighting.<T3>4. Inspection space.</T3>a. <T3>Cervical inspection station.</T3> Cervical inspection is currentlyrequired to be completed prior to viscera inspection (Meat and PoultryInspection Manual, section 11.1(h)(1). See footnote\1\). In some instances,when establishments have added new equipment and/or remodeled their slaughterfacilities, it has been necessary, when a moving chain is used, for themto increase the velocity of the head chain in order to meet this inspectionrequirement.There would be new requirements for cattle cervical inspection when theheads are spaced evenly on the head chain at 4-foot intervals. The interrelationshipsbetween the speed of the head chain, the rate at which heads are presentedfor inspection, the number of inspectors needed, and the required workspacefor inspectors to inspect them are defined in the proposed regulation.If the head spacing is less than 4 feet, the head chain velocity must beproportionally decreased. Establishments which desire to space heads atdistances greater than 4 feet would be handled on an individual basis asdiscussed earlier (Section III B). The velocity of the head chain wouldnot be allowed to exceed the maximum limits.b. <T3>Tongue and head reinspection station.</T3> For evaluating samples offinished tongues and heads, as required by the finished product standardsprogram, a reinspection area would be required where the manufacturingprocess is determined to be completed. It would be required to be illuminatedas defined in the facility requirements of this proposed rule. The areawould include a reinspection table or stand with hooks. It is proposedthat the reinspection area be located as close as possible to the headchain and/or area of head processing completion in order to minimize workand maximize the flow of product.c. <T3>Viscera/carcass inspection station. </T3>The inspection space at theviscera/carcass inspection station for slaughter rates of 234 head perhour or less would remain unchanged at 8 feet. However, the space for theinside carcass inspector would increase to 9 feet and be arranged with5 feet along the viscera table and 4 feet along the line of travel of thecarcasses. When kidneys are presented in the carcass (slaughter rates greaterthan 234 head per hour), the kidneys and carcasses would be inspected froman adjustable platform, the height of which can be easily and rapidly adjustedfrom the platform. The platform would have to meet specific minimum widthand length requirements. Under these specifications, establishments wouldbe required to submit blueprints for approval to FSIS' Facilities, Equipment,and Sanitation Division. The complete specifications may be obtained fromFacilities, Equipment, and Sanitation Division, Technical Services, FoodSafety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington,DC 20250; (202) 447-5627. Slaughter rates greater than 400 head per hour would require additionalfacilities, developed by the establishment, to allow organs to remain atthe inspection station until the inspector has completed routine inspectiontasks. In addition these facilities will allow proper identification ofthe carcass and its parts throughout the inspection process. d. <T3>Carcass reinspection station. </T3>For evaluating samples of finishedcarcasses, as required by the finished product standards program, a reinspectionarea would be required off the main conveyer chain, large enough to adequatelyhold six to nine carcasses for defect examination and illuminated as definedin the facility requirements of this proposed rule. The area would alsoinclude a stationary platform. The space is best located after the carcasswash and before entry into the cooler. However, it may alternatively belocated before the carcass wash. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Carcass Dressing Requirements </ITAG>Establishment employees would be responsible for independently removingdressing nonconformances and other designated trimmable conditions. Thiswould include, but not be limited to, bruises, certain abscesses and adhesions,larvae of <T3>Hypoderma bovis </T3>and <T3>Hypoderma lineata </T3>(cattle grubs), hair, dirt, organ remnants,and grease and oil. <T3>IV. Inspector Staffing Requirements </T3>Preliminary inspector staffing requirements (known as inspector staffingstandards) have been developed for establishments that slaughter steersand heifers at rates requiring three or more on-line inspectors. ProposedSIS staffing standards are under development for establishments which slaughtersteers and heifers and require less than three inspectors, and for establishmentsslaughtering cows and bulls. It is anticipated that the inspection ratesfor cows and bulls would be less than those for steers and heifers. Cowsand bulls are not subject to this proposed regulation. <T3>V. Impact Of Implementation </T3>SIS-Cattle would enable FSIS to inspect cattle more efficiently and effectively.The change in location of the kidney inspection operation would accomplishtwo desirable goals. First, kidneys may be inspected at the same time asother organs to allow correlation of all findings simultaneously by theinspectors. The traditional method of kidney inspection in the United Stateshas been criticized by foreign inspection officials because findings cannotbe correlated simultaneously with all visceral organs. Second, combiningthe carcass and viscera inspection stations would allow both industry andinspection personnel greater assurance that the correct viscera remainsidentified with the corresponding carcass until disposition of the carcassand all of its parts has been made. Combining the carcass and viscera inspection stations in the slaughteringestablishment should benefit both the industry and the government. SIS-Cattlewould be utilized in establishments using three or more on-line inspectors.These establishments may elect to use the SIS/PQC-Cattle. As discussedin the preamble summary and section II of this document, those establishmentscurrently slaughtering at rates greater than 275 head per hour would berequired to convert to SIS/PQC-Cattle in order to control their operation.Those establishments which do not develop and implement a PQC program tocontrol their operation would be required to reduce their rate of productionto 275 head per hour. Establishments slaughtering at rates of 275 headper hour or less can demonstrate sufficient process control without a formalQC program and QC personnel. Those establishments wanting to exceed 400head per hour would be required to develop methodology, i.e., side tablesto allow organs to remain accessible to the inspector until inspectionis completed. It is anticipated that the cattle slaughtering industry would experiencea net gain if this new system of inspection were implemented, in spiteof the initial costs of facility modifications which may be necessary insome establishments. Based on pilot testing, the industry as a whole shouldrealize a savings because of increased productivity and reduced overtime.Also, the pilot tests indicated that by assuming a more active role overthe control of its dressing operations, the industry should be better ableto control its rate of production and its cost per unit produced. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>9 CFR Part 307Facilities9 CFR Part 310Meat inspectionFor reasons set out in the preamble, Title 9, Parts 307 and 310 of theCode of Federal Regulations would be amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 307_FACILITIES FOR INSPECTION</ITAG>1.

The current CUSUM equals the sum of the totalvalue of nonconformances for a subgroup plus the starting CUSUM (eitherthe start number or the CUSUM for the previously tested subgroup), minusthe tolerance number. CUSUM may not be less than zero or greater than theaction number.(2) <T3>Tolerance number. </T3>The total value of nonconformances in each subgroupif product is being produced at a national average product quality level.See Table 2 of this section.(3) <T3>Action number. </T3>A CUSUM value which indicates that product actionis required. See Table 2 of this section.(4) <T3>Start number. </T3>A value halfway between zero and the action number.The start number is used to determine the starting CUSUM for the firstsubgroup of a shift and to reset the CUSUM value if the CUSUM is equalto or greater than the action number. See Table 2 of this section.(5) <T3>Subgroup. </T3>For carcasses, three half-carcass (three sides) sampleunits collected before product enters the cooler; for edible byproducts,except for tongues and heads, ten sample units of each byproduct; and fortongues and heads, five tongue and five head sample units collected priorto chilling.(6) <T3>Subgroup absolute limit. </T3>The tolerance number plus 5. See Table2 of this section.(7) <T3>Maximum number. </T3>For edible byproducts the maximum number of nonconformancesfor each of the 12 categories that may be recorded for a single sampleunit. The maximum number for each category is contained in Table 3 of thissection.(8) <T3>Subgroup maximum limit. </T3>For tongues and heads, when 3 or moresample units in a subgroup have nonconformances that equal or exceed themaximum number for any one nonconformance; for other edible byproductsthe limit is 5 or more.(9) <T3>Rework. </T3>Reprocessing the product to correct the condition or conditionscausing the nonconformances listed in Tables 1 and 3 of this section.

The process will be monitored by random sampling.(15) <T3>Process out of control. </T3>The process is out of control when processverification test results are above the tolerance number. The establishmentmay stop identifying product for rework after a verification test resultis below tolerance; however, the process is not in control until a secondconsecutive verification test result is below tolerance. Random samplingis suspended while the process is out of control.(c) <T3>General. </T3>(1) The inspector in charge shall have the authorityto require the establishment to reduce line speeds as stated in andSection;310.1(b)of this subchapter.(2) Adulterated product shall be condemned and destroyed, except that carcasses,parts of carcasses, and edible byproducts which may be made wholesome byrework under the supervision of the inspector may be passed after the conditioncausing the nonconformance is removed as prescribed in andSection;310.18.Inspectors shall monitor the sampling of finished carcasses and parts ofcarcasses for compliance with finished product standards (See Table 1 ofthis section) and shall monitor edible byproducts for compliance with ediblebyproducts standards (See Table 3 of this section). If nonconformancesare present at certain statistical levels, the establishment shall takecorrective action. If the establishment does not take corrective action,the inspector shall initiate corrective action.(3) The inspector shall determine which carcasses and edible byproductsshall be condemned, retained for veterinary disposition, or allowed toproceed as a passed carcass or edible byproduct subject to trim and reinspection.Carcasses with nonconformances listed in Table 1 of this section, whichdo not require condemnation of the entire carcass, shall be passed by theinspector, but shall be subject to reinspection to ensure the physicalremoval of the nonconformances. The inspector shall identify such carcassesfor trim when the defects are not readily observable and shall identifycarcasses for reconditioning. Trimming of carcasses passed subject to reinspectionshall be performed by one or more establishment trimmers positioned aftercarcass splitting and prior reinspection.(d) <T3>Post-mortem inspection. </T3>(1) <T3>Facilities. </T3>The establishment shall provide inspection stationsin compliance with andSection;307.2(m) of this subchapter.(2) <T3>Presentation. </T3>(i) <T3>Head (cervical). </T3>(A) Tongue: Prior to inpsection, an establishmentemployee shall palpate the tongue and notify the inspectors at the cervicalstation of any abnormalities.

An inspector shall monitor theestablishment's compliance with the standards and shall take correctiveaction if the establishment has failed to apply the standards.(2) <T3>Finished product standards (FPS):</T3> Finished product standards arecriteria applied to carcasses. These criteria consist of nonconformances(listed in Table 1 of this section), measured on randomly selected, consecutivesubgroup samples collected on the slaughter line at a point after all trimmingis completed. The total value of nonconformances for each subgroup is reducedto a CUSUM number and measured against the finished product standards (SeeTable 2 of the this section). Compliance with FPS is measured by determiningthe CUSUM on consecutive subgroup samples. Reinspection may be performedbefore the carcass washer or immediately after the carcass washer.(3) <T3>Edible byproducts standards: </T3>(i) Edible byproduct standards applyto fully processed brains, cheeks, cheek trimmings, feet (front and hind),heads, hearts, small intestines, kidneys, lips, livers, mountain chain,pancreas, spleens, tails, thymus, tongues, tongue trimmings, tripe, andweasands.(ii) Edible byproduct standards are criteria which consist of nonconformances(listed in Table 3 of this section), measured on consecutive subgroup samplescollected after all cleaning and preparation is completed. The total valueof nonconformances for each subgroup test is reduced to a CUSUM numberand measured against the edible byproduct standards (See Table 4 of thissection). Compliance with the standards in measured by determining theCUSUM on consecutive subgroup samples.(iii) Except as provided elsewhere in Part 310, edible byproducts shallbe examined using the criteria contained in Table 3 of this section.(4) Finished product testing:(i) Actions to be taken when the process is in control. If the CUSUM isless than the action number, and the subgroup absolute limit for cattlecarcasses is not exceeded, the process is in control. If the CUSUM is lessthan the action number, and the subgroup maximum limit for heads, tonguesand all other edible byproducts is not exceeded, the process is in control.(A) Establishment Actions. The establishment shall:(<T3>1</T3>) Randomly select and record a subgroup testing time for eachproduct. The record of randomly selected times must be available for theinspector to monitor.(<T3>i</T3>) Carcasses, head, and tongues are to be sampled once each productionhour.(<T3>ii</T3>) Sampling frequency for edible byproducts, except tongues andheads.Each edible byproduct shall be sampled at a frequency of an average ofonce every two hours, except that the inspector in charge may allow anestablishment which produces more than six types of edible byproducts,not including tongues and heads, to select by random method, a minimumof six types of edible byproducts for sampling, provided that each typeof edible byproduct must be sampled at least once during the productionshift. The process for selecting random sampling times for edible byproductsmust given each hour of the production shift an equal chance of being selected.(<T3>A</T3>) The inspector in charge may allow an edible byproduct to besampled at a frequency on an average of once every 4 hours after the ediblebyproduct has completed 20 consecutive sample tests without any CUSUM scoresreaching the action number or exceeding the subgroup maximum limit.(<T3>B</T3>) If an edible byproduct, which has been sampled at a frequencyof once every 4 hours, has completed 10 consecutive sample tests withoutany CUSUM scores reaching the action number or exceeding the subgroup maximumlimit, the inspector in charge may allow the edible byproduct to be sampledat a frequency of an average of once every 8 hours, provided that the ediblebyproduct shall be sampled at least once during the production shift.(<T3>C</T3>) If the CUSUM score for any edible byproduct that is sampledat a frequency of an average of less than once every two hours reacheseither the action number or exceeds the subgroup maximum limit, the ediblebyproduct shall be sampled at a frequency of once every 2 hours. Each typeof edible byproduct process must independently earn reduced frequency sampling.(<T3>2</T3>) Conduct designated subgroup tests at the preselected times.(<T3>3</T3>) Total the value of the subgroup nonconformances and calculatethe current CUSUM. Immediately record the current CUSUM score and informthe production supervisor about any process trend.(B) Inspector Actions. The insepctor shall:(<T3>1</T3>) Conduct subgroup tests on carcasses, head, and tongues at randomtimes twice during each shift. The randomly selected times shall be knownonly to the insepctor until the sample is selected.(<T3>2</T3>) Monitor subgroup tests conducted by the establishment.(<T3>3</T3>) Compare subgroup test results with establishment's subgrouptest results. If results are not in agreement, the inspector will correlateresults with the establishment.(<T3>4</T3>) Instruct the establishment to take corrective action when asubgroup total exceeds the subgroup absolute limit for carcasses or exceedsthe subgroup maximum limit for heads, tongues and other edible byproducts.(ii) Actions to be taken when the subgroup absolute limit for carcassesis exceeded. If an individual subgroup total exceeds the subgroup absolutelimit, but is less than the action number, the establishment shall determineif any of the five previous subgroups resulted in a CUSUM above the startnumber.(A) If none of the five previous subgroups resulted in a CUSUM above thestart number, the establishment shall immediately conduct another subgrouptest. If this retest subgroup total equals the tolerance number or less,then random testing may continue. If the retest subgroup total exceedsthe tolerance number, the establishment shall immediately begin the actionsdescribed in subparagraph (iv)(A) of this paragraph. In either case, theretest results shall be used to calculate CUSUM.(B) If any of the five previous subgroups resulted in a CUSUM above thestart number, the establishment shall begin actions described in subparagraph(iv)(A) of this paragraph.(iii) Actions to be taken when a designated trimmable condition is foundon a carcass. If any designated trimmable condition is found during a subgrouptest, the establishment shall immediately:(A) Notify the inspector in charge of the findings.(B) Identify the carcass and all subsequently produced carcasses for possiblerework.(C) Conduct a verification subgroup test examining only for designatedtrimmable conditions.(<T3>1</T3>) If any designated trimmable condition is found, all carcasses,beginning with the last previous sampled subgroup that was passed, shallbe reworked by the establishment. The establishment shall not be requiredto identify and rework carcasses produced after a second verification subgrouptest results in the finding of no designated trimmable conditions. Theestablishment shall conduct another verification subgroup test for designatedtrimmable conditions within 30 minutes.(<T3>i</T3>) If no designated trimmable condition is found, the establishmentmay continue random sampling.(<T3>ii</T3>) If any designated trimmable condition is found, the testedcarcass and all subsequently produced carcasses shall be identified andreworked by the establishment. The establishment shall not be requiredto identify and rework carcasses produced after a subsequent subgroup testresults in the finding of no designated trimmable conditions.(<T3>2</T3>) If no designated trimmable condition is found, the establishmentshall not be required to rework the identified carcasses. The establishmentshall conduct a second verification subgroup test for designated trimmableconditions within 30 minutes.(<T3>i</T3>) If no designated trimmable condition is found, the establishmentmay continue random sampling.(<T3>ii</T3>) If any designated trimmable condition is found, the testedcarcass and all subsequently produced carcasses shall be identified andreworked by the establishment. The establishment shall not be requiredto identify and rework carcasses produced after two consecutive, subsequentsubgroup test results in the finding of no designated trimmable conditions.(iv) Actions to be taken when the CUSUM reaches the action number for carcassesor for heads, tongues, and other edible byproducts or when the subgroupmaximum limit for heads, tongues, and other edible byproducts is reached.When CUSUM reaches the action number for carcasses or heads, tongues, andother edible byproducts, the process may be out of control. When the subgroupmaximum limit for heads, tongues, and edible byproducts is reached, theprocess may be out of control.(A) Establishment Actions. The establishment shall immediately:(<T3>1</T3>) Identify the product and subsequently produced product of thesame type for possible rework. The initial test results which reach theaction number indicate only the possibility that the process is out ofcontrol. The process is not out of control until a verification subgrouptest exceeds the tolerance number. When the process is out of control,identify the product beginning with the last previous sampled subgroupthat was passed. Product action (identification and rework) begins at thatpoint in the process.(<T3>2</T3>) Notify the inspector in charge and production supervisor thatthe CUSUM has reached the action number.(<T3>3</T3>) Suspend random subgroup testing of the affected type of product.(<T3>4</T3>) Examine establishment records with the responsible productionsupervisor to determine the cause of the problem.(<T3>5</T3>) Conduct a verification subgroup test.(<T3>i</T3>) If the subgroup total for the verification subgroup test exceedsthe tolerance number for carcasses, all carcasses identified for possiblerework shall be reworked by the establishment. The establishment shallnot be required to identify and rework carcasses produced after a subsequentsubgroup test results in a subgroup total equal to or less than the tolerancenumber.(<T3>A</T3>) If the subgroup total for the verification subgroup test isless than or equal to the tolerance number, the establishment shall notbe required to rework the identified carcasses. The establishment shallconduct a second verification subgroup test within 30 minutes.(<T3>B</T3>) If the subgroup total for the second verification subgrouptest exceeds the tolerance number, the tested carcass and all subsequentlyproduced carcasses shall be identified and reworked by the establishment.The establishment shall not be required to identify and rework carcassesproduced after a subsequent subgroup test results in a subgroup equal toor less than the tolerance number.(<T3>ii</T3>) If the subgroup total exceeds the tolerance number or thesubgroup maximum limit is reached for heads, tongues and other edible byproducts,all edible byproducts identified for possible rework shall be reworkedby the establishment. The establishment shall not be required to identifyand rework edible byproducts produced after a subsequent subgroup testresults in a subgroup total equal to or less than the tolerance numberand the subgroup maximum limit is not reached.(<T3>A</T3>) If the subgroup total for the verification subgroup test isless than or equal to the tolerance number and the subgroup maximum limitis not reached, the establishment shall not be required to rework identifiededible byproducts. The establishment shall conduct a second verificationsubgroup test within 30 minutes.(<T3>B</T3>) If the subgroup total for the second verification subgrouptest exceeds the tolerance number or the subgroup maximum limit is reached,the tested edible byproducts and all subsequently produced edible byproductsof the same type shall be identified and reworked by the establishment.The establishment shall not be required to identify and rework edible byproductsproduced after a subsequent subgroup test results in a subgroup total equalequal to or less than the tolerance number of the subgroup maximum limitis not reached.(<T3>6</T3>) The process is in control and random sampling may be resumedafter two consecutive subgroup tests are equal to or less than the tolerancenumber for carcasses; or are equal to or less than the tolerance numberfor edible byproducts; or the subgroup maximum limit for edible byproductsis reached:(<T3>i</T3>) Establishment continues random subgroup testing.(<T3>ii</T3>) CUSUM may be reset. If the two consecutive subgroup totalsdo not cause CUSUM to fall to the start number or below, CUSUM is resetat the start number.(B) Inspector Actions. The inspector shall: (<T3>1</T3>) Monitor the establishment's corrective actions to ensure thatthe FPS requirements for actions are met.(<T3>2</T3>) Suspend random monitoring when the establishment is conductingproduct action.(<T3>3</T3>) Correlate nonconformance criteria with the establishment asneeded.(f) After the subgroup tests are completed, nonconformances on carcasses,parts of carcasses, and edible byproducts sampled should be removed beforethe carcasses, parts and byproducts are returned to the product flow, orif such nonconformances cannot be removed, the articles shall be handledunder the provisions of Part 311 of this subchapter.(g) Slaughter Line Partial Quality Control.
