Giant monopole statesare calculated by the HF+RPA response function method using three parametersets of the Skyrme interactions SGI, SGII and SIII which give the compressionmoduli K/sub {infinity}/ = 269 MeV, 217 MeV and 356 MeV, respectively.Our calculations reproduce the kink of the observed isotope shifts at/sup 208/Pb, while the second-order effect due to the giant quadrupoleresonances is not enough to explain the observed odd-even staggering.The Skyrme force SGII having K/sub {infinity}/ = 217 MeV shows the bestquantitative agreement among three forces in comparison with the experimentaldata of the isotope shifts of Pb nuclei. The effect of the effectivemass is also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
