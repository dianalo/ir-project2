The enraged General Assembly rebuked Washingtonand traveled to Geneva in protest to hear him. But even that disputewas set aside when the United States accepted what Arafat said as arenunciation of terror and opened talks with the PLO.   _By Victoria Graham</TEXT><NOTE>In Central America, No One Said `Uncle'</NOTE><TEXT>   WASHINGTON _ Reagan took office determined to reverse pro-Sovietsentiment in Central America. He leaves with those hopes unfulfilled.   Nicaragua's leftist government appears firmly entrenched as thethousands of Contra rebels on whom Reagan invested much politicalcapital find themselves in dreary camps along theHonduran-Nicaraguan border, cut off from U.S. military support.Reagan once told a press conference that his goal in Nicaragua wasto see the Sandinistas ``say uncle.''   In El Salvador, there is more uncertainty than at any time since1984 when a democratically-elected president, Jose Napoleon Duarte,took office.   That event was a victory for administration perseverance butDuarte's term is ending with a guerrilla war still raging and livingstandards far below what they were a decade ago despite hundreds ofmillions of dollars of U.S. aid. The country's political life ismarked by increasing polarization.   Military governments in Guatemala and Honduras have given way toelected governments but in both countries full blown democracy hasyet to take root.   Nicaragua ranks as a major Reagan disappointment. In every otherregional conflict _ Afghanistan, Angola and Cambodia _ theadministration can claim a measure of success.   Reagan was never able to sell the notion to the American peoplethat the Sandinista government was a menace which, left unchecked,would result in the spread of Marxism throughout Central America andinto Mexico.   He could never rally a sustainable consensus in support of hisview that the best way to deal with the Sandinistas was throughgenerous support for the Contra rebels, who Reagan once called the``moral equivalent of the founding fathers.''   Within the Reagan White House the Contra cause became a highlyemotional issue. It induced some of the administration's moststrategically placed people _ National Security advisor JohnPoindexter and Lt. Col. Oliver North _ to bend or perhaps break thelaw because defeat of the Contras seemed so unthinkable. Both werecharged with breaking the law.   _By George Gedda</TEXT><NOTE>Arms Control: A Landmark Agreement and a Dashed Hope for Even More</NOTE><TEXT>   WASHINGTON _ Reagan leaves office with a mixed record on armscontrol. The treaty he signed at the Washington summit withGorbachev in December 1987 was a landmark. For the first time inhistory, an entire category of U.S. and Soviet missiles _ those inthe intermediate range of 300 to 3,000 miles _ was abolished.   The treaty also broke new ground in providing for Sovietinspectors to observe the destruction of banned U..S. missiles here,while American monitors checked up on the Soviets at their sites.   Left undone, however, was the larger Reagan goal of completing atreaty to reduce globe-girdling nuclear missiles, bombers andsubmarines by 30 to 50 percent.   Some of the weapons ticketed for cutbacks, such as sea-launchedcruise missiles, are extremely difficult to detect. Negotiationsstalled over verification procedures, while the Soviets neverabandoned their attempt to impose some sort of restrictions on theU.S. anti-ballistic missile program as part of a Strategic ArmsReduction Treaty.   The program, known formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative,is aimed at mounting a defense in space against Soviet ballisticmissiles.   In other arms control areas, Reagan did not reach an agreementwith the Soviets on ways to monitor underground nuclear tests norfind a way to deter the proliferation of chemical weapons. Heaccused the Soviets in reports to Congress of probably exceeding thepermissible 150-kiloton ceiling on underground blasts.   _By Barry Schweid</TEXT><NOTE>Japan: The Porcupine Cooperates</NOTE><TEXT>   WASHINGTON _ The prime minister of Japan made his get-acquaintedcall less than four months into President Reagan's first term.   Questioned about defense policy by members of the House ForeignAffairs Committee, Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki said Japan felt it``Better to be a porcupine than a roaring lion.''   But the official interpreter got it wrong and ``porcupine'' cameout in English as ``wise mouse.'' The Japanese embassy corrected theanimal mixup but the incident still triggered a burst of commentthat Japan was shirking responsibility and enjoying a ``free ride''on defense at the cost of the United States.   To some Americans _ those displaced from jobs by imports _ Japanmay look today like a lion-sized economic porcupine. But expertsrate overall relations better today than at the beginning of theReagan years.   Quality- and price-conscious U.S. consumers continue to buy upJapanese products. Lack of American competitiveness has becomerecognized as part of the problem of U.S. trade deficits that rosefrom $16 billion with Japan in 1981 to nearly $70 billion beforethey started to decline last year.   Eight years and two prime ministers after Suzuki visitedWashington, the Japanese continue to shun a ``roaring lion''military role and there is greater acceptance of this at thePentagon and White House. The Reagan administration hails as asuccess the defense relationship in which Japan now helps pay theupkeep of nearly 55,000 U.S. personnel on its territory and providesdestroyers, anti-submarine patrols and jet fighters to defendsealanes up to 1,000 nautical miles off its shores.   It also applauds Japan's offsetting of itsconstitutionally-mandated low military profile by becoming theworld's largest foreign aid donor with a five-year, $50 billionprogram of assistance tied less and less to buying Japanese products.   Experts give Reagan and his administration good marks forrecognizing Japan's growing status as an economic superpower vitalto the United States and encouraging the relationship to mature intoa partnership stressing dialogue and shared benefits more thanname-calling.   _By Gene Kramer</TEXT><NOTE>The Ron-Margaret Relationship: A Staunch Ally in Europe</NOTE><TEXT>   LONDON _ The Reagan years brought a specialness to theBritish-American relationship not seen since World War II, and PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher made it the cornerstone of her foreignpolicy.   For Reagan, Mrs. Thatcher has stood alone among the other WestEuropean leaders, even at political cost. For example, she was thesole ally to back the 1986 U.S. bombing raid on Libya, which mostothers in Britain denounced as heavy-handed and futile.   Under Mrs. Thatcher, Britain followed the United States out ofUNESCO in 1985; was the first to deploy U.S. cruise missiles inEurope in 1983; and, when the superpowers agreed in 1987 to removethe missiles, she publicly endorsed the deal despite privatereservations.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
