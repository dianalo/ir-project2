Currency traders said some customers who had closed their books for 1987 returned to unload dollars yesterday, apparently trying to limit their losses from the U.S. currency's renewed dive of recent days.    As on Monday, the dollar's weakness spilled over into the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 16.08 points, to 1926.89. Prices of long-term Treasury bonds rallied late in the day, though, rising about $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Bond traders said they were encouraged by central bank intervention in support of the dollar.    The dollar has fallen 3.3% against the Japanese yen and 2.3% against the West German mark since Dec. 15. For the year, the dollar is off 22% against the yen and 17% against the mark.    People &quot;can't ignore moves of this magnitude,&quot; Garrett R. Glass, vice president, First National Bank of Chicago, said. &quot;No one can afford to stay home.&quot;    Yesterday's foreign exchange market at times was unusually active for an end-of-year session. Mr. Glass said trading was &quot;at least moderate&quot; during the morning in the U.S. market, in response to central banks' efforts to shore up the dollar. Among the central banks buying dollars and selling foreign currency were the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan.    Activity late in the day turned choppy and trailed off. By midafternoon, one New York trader said, &quot;You probably couldn't get a price around here if you wanted to.&quot;    Some traders said the central banks' failure to spark a sustained dollar rally in a relatively thin market was a sign of profoundly bearish sentiment for the currency. But others said the governments wanted only to stabilize the falling dollar. One trader said it would have been unwise for the government bankers to try to do more now.    If central banks had intervened more heavily, said Varick Martin, a vice president in New York for Union Bank of Switzerland, &quot;you set the stage for a pullback in the new year,&quot; after the holiday season ends and large numbers of participants return to the markets.    The dollar probably could have been forced higher through intervention, he said, but this could make it more expensive for the central banks to defend those higher levels next week in more liquid markets.    The Bank of Japan bought dollars &quot;continuously&quot; in afternoon trading in Tokyo, reports from Japan said. Later, the West German Bundesbank intervened at the Frankfurt foreign exchange fixing and reportedly bought dollars in the open market as well. The Swiss National Bank confirmed it bought dollars in Zurich trading, and the Bank of England, U.S. Fed and Bank of Canada also reportedly moved to support the U.S. currency.    Reports varied on the amounts involved, but the activity was generally described as light. Some traders characterized it as a &quot;token&quot; move aimed at showing the market that the nations will act to support the latest call by the Group of Seven for a halt in the dollar's decline.    Estimates of dollar-buying by the Fed, which wouldn't confirm or deny reports of its activity, ranged from $50 million to $100 million. The Bundesbank bought $18.3 million at the fixing; reports of its open-market activity didn't cite any figures. Bank of Japan activity was estimated at $30 million to $100 million. The figures added up to a tiny fraction of overall world market activity, which was estimated at $100 billion or more yesterday.    The activity brought the dollar off its intraday lows of 123.10 yen and 1.5880 marks, reached in European trading. The low against the mark tied the dollar's postwar low against the West German currency set Monday.    In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 123.48 yen, down slightly from 123.65 late Monday, and 1.5947 marks, compared with 1.5980 a day earlier. The British pound eased to $1.8605 from $1.8612.    Wednesday, the dollar was quoted in early trading at 123.65 yen, up marginally from 123.60 at the opening of trading in Japan, and also higher than 123.50 yen at the Tokyo close Tuesday.    Yesterday's session, with central banks stepping in to buy dollars and traders selling them, may have provided a preview of the skirmishes that many traders and analysts expect in the new year as the market tests the central banks' willingness to support the U.S. currency.    There was &quot;a lot of posturing and gesturing for 1988 going on&quot; yesterday, Mr. Martin of UBS said. He said he expects the new year to begin with a large dollar sell-off, followed by heavy central bank intervention aimed at sending the dollar back up and &quot;punishing the speculators.&quot;    Although such intervention only is effective for a while, Mr. Martin said, &quot;that can seem like a lifetime to a trader.&quot;    But whatever strategy the central banks and traders adopt, many economists and analysts still expect the dollar to set new lows in 1988.    A West German commercial bank economist, who asked not to be identified, said major exporters in that country have been basing their 1988 budgets on a projected dollar value of 1.40 to 1.50 marks. Some, he said, are beginning to think they should be planning for a dollar rate of 1.30 marks.    One reason is the belief that there won't be as much central bank intervention to hold the line on the dollar-mark rate next year. This year's heavy dollar-buying and interest-rate cuts by the Bundesbank have caused the nation's foreign currency reserves and money supply to soar, raising fears of inflation ahead.    The West German inflation rate is still extremely low by international standards, the economist said. But a historic fear of inflation means the German government will be reluctant to continue policies that could lead to higher prices at home.    In addition, he said, the November U.S. trade report due Jan. 15 will be the first U.S. trade report to reflect much of the current lower exchange rates for the dollar. The past quarter's trade reports, he said, have valued West German imports at a rate of 1.80 marks to the dollar. The numbers that are used after the U.S. Customs Service makes its quarterly exchange rate adjustment, he said, will tend to raise the dollar value of imports and thus widen the deficit.    First Chicago's Mr. Glass, expressing doubt that a turnaround in the trade deficit will come soon, said: &quot;The only policy tool the U.S. has that can stop the dollar's fall is interest rates. Until the U.S. changes its stance (of not wanting to raise rates), the dollar will continue to fall.&quot; He predicted that the currency's decline will become severe enough to force the Reagan administration to raise some rates in 1988, despite the risk of triggering an economic downturn during an election year.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $1.60 an ounce to $486.10 in very light trading. Estimated volume was 1.2 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $486.75 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Tuesday, Dec. 29, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
