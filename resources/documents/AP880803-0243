(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pat Robertson says the legacy of hisfailed presidential bid are ``the tens of thousands of people whoare now activated in the political life of America'' and the 25minutes of prime time the Republican National Committee will givehim at the convention.   But longtime Robertson watchers say the former Southern Baptistpreacher and president of the Christian Broadcasting Network may bemisinterpreting his political impact.   ``He is going to have a very miniscule role in the convention,''said Mark Rozell, a political scientist from Mary WashingtonUniversity in Fredericksburg, Va. ``And, frankly, I think he isoverstating his importance to the conservative movement.''   ``It's a mixed blessing that Robertson bestows on the party,''said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist.``He is not an appealing figure to young Republicans who bring alibertarian flavor to the party. Robertson is anything butlibertarian.''   Robertson sees himself as the party's conservativestandard-bearer, leading thousands of new members.   ``The reward that I have from this effort,'' Robertson saidrecently in an interview with The Associated Press, ``is to befound in the tens of thousands of people who are now activated inthe political life of America.''   Robertson's campaign utilized a strong grassroots organizationof political neophytes, many from fundamentalist or charismaticchurches, to seize control of the party leadership on the locallevel in several states.   The operation resulted in a pattern for the campaign _ poorfinishes in primaries such as New Hampshire and moderate successesin caucuses, including Iowa.   In his home state of Virginia, Robertson placed third amongthree candidates. Seven days later, he laid off his top twocampaign aides, cut the staff and said he would limit hiscampaigning to states with caucuses.   In April, Robertson said he was withdrawing from the race, thenlater amended that to suspending his campaign. While pledging hissupport for Bush, Robertson refused to release his delegates,saying he wanted to go to the national convention as theconservative voice of the party.   Shortly thereafter, he returned to CBN to rescue the financiallystrapped religious broadcasting empire that had laid off more than1,000 workers during his campaign and cut its budget by more than40 percent as contributions dwindled.   Robertson goes to the convention pushing for a platform thatmirrors the 1980 and 1984 versions on which Ronald Reagan waselected. Those battles were fought and won by conservatives at thelast two conventions, giving Robertson no new ground.   And with only about 200 delegates to Bush's 2,000, Robertson``has no leverage on the platform issues,'' Rozell said.   ``The Robertson people are perceived to be there not to supportthe ticket, but to support Pat,'' said Rozell, who is the co-editorof a soon-to-be released book on the contemporary conservativemovement. ``So the party regulars are making overtures to themthrough Robertson.''   Robertson said his speech will deal with foreign policy. Sabatobelieves the topic is significant.   ``I think it's an attempt to keep him off social issues where hetends to turn off young people,'' he said. ``You can bet thatBush's people will be at work editing the speech.''   Robertson points to the scheduling of his speech _ the Tuesdaynight of the convention _ as a sign of his standing in the party.His speech follows a tribute to former Arizona Sen. BarryGoldwater, the party's 1964 presidential nominee and longtimeleader of its conservative wing.   Robertson will be introduced by Goldwater's former campaignmanager, Cliff White, showing ``the continuity of conservatism overthe last 25 years of the party.   ``It would be nice to have Barry Goldwater's campaign managercome and say this is the conservative leader who fits in with someof the things that have come from the past,'' Robertson said.   ``That is a vast overstatement,'' Rozell said. ``And I imagine alot of conservatives are uncomfortable. Most of them came upthrough the ranks of government and fought for the conservativecause from within. Now Robertson is showing up _ an outsider _ andclaiming to be the heir-apparent.   ``That ought to anger the (New York Rep. Jack) Kempsupporters,'' he said.   Robertson, who is back hosting the CBN's flagship program, ``The700 Club,'' said he hopes to broaden news coverage and its appealto young professional viewers. He said the ministry has turned thecorner and that donations are starting to go up again.   But his presidential campaign is still more than $1 million indebt, and he has turned to his supporters for more money, couchedin language that is vintage Robertson.   ``I ran for president because I felt God wanted me to run forpresident,'' he said in a recent letter to supporters. ``My faithwas ridiculed. My motives and my words distorted. Lies were spreadabout my war record, my education, and my resume.   ``Why did I go through all of this? The answer is very simple.God does not want us to turn America over to radical feminists,drug dealers, militant homosexuals, profligate spenders, humanistsor world communists. God does not want our unborn babiesslaughtered, our homes broken up, our bodies defiled, or our littlechildren forbidden to pray in our schools.''   He then asks for $25 donations to retire the debt, otherwise,``All my future work as your champion would be injured.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 7</NOTE></DOC>
