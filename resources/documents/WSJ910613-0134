Civil libertarians have praised it,critics such as The Wall Street Journal have condemned it,and police officers recite it thousands of times a day.   It was the result of the Supreme Court's most famouscriminal decision, made 25 years ago today. In its 5-to-4decision in Miranda vs. Arizona, perhaps its most famouscriminal case, the court held that arrested suspects must beadvised of their constitutional-rights -- before theirconfessions to police -- could be presented at trial.</LP><TEXT>   After laboring for years with subjective and variablecriteria, the court in Miranda formulated objective anduniform standards and required that specific, constitutionalinformation be read to persons in custody. Only when suspectsunderstand their rights can they waive those rights. Foryears, critics have denounced Miranda for blockingconfessions from unwarned suspects and for mandating thatconstitutional information be given to citizens when theyneed it most -- upon their arrest. According to itsdetractors, Miranda undermines the criminal justice systembecause police investigations have been compromised; lawenforcement has become more difficult; and dangerouscriminals have gone unprosecuted or have been turned loose ona &quot;technicality.&quot; Met head-on, these criticisms are wrong orare hugely exaggerated.   In almost every instance, Miranda does not affect methodsof pre-arrest investigation and detection because the court'sdecision applies only to suspects in custody. For thisreason, police need not read &quot;Miranda warnings&quot; to witnesses,third parties or even suspects themselves until they areactually under arrest. Miranda only crimps police when theyconduct custodial interrogations.   Has Miranda made law enforcement more difficult? Of courseit has. For 25 years, police have been forced to readconstitutional rights to hundreds of thousands of suspects,without word games, lies or qualifiers. If the arrestingofficers are not professional enough to read the Mirandawarnings in the first place, and if the only evidence is theunwarned suspect's confession, then the prosecutor's casewill be stillborn. However:   -- Reading suspects their rights is hardly more than anettlesome inconvenience for police. And under theConstitution, it is supposed to be difficult to deprivecitizens of their liberty.   -- Unlike other constitutional protections such as trialby jury, Miranda's &quot;burden&quot; on the justice system can beshouldered quickly and inexpensively. It takes only secondsfor trained officers to read Miranda warnings.   -- All Miranda did was &quot;constitutionalize&quot; what the FBIhad been doing for years before -- read arrested suspectstheir rights. Surely the FBI would not have engaged in apractice that compromised effective law enforcement.   As the Supreme Court ruled in 1971 in Harris vs. New York,Miranda does not give suspects a license to lie. If policefail to warn a suspect properly and the suspect confesses,the police can then read the suspect a Miranda warning. Ifthe suspect at that point changes his mind and denies thecrime, the original confession can still be presented attrial to &quot;impeach&quot; or contradict the suspect's denial.   But what about the principal law-and-order argument: thatMiranda has permitted dangerous criminals to go free? Hasthis &quot;judicially invented technicality&quot; stifled the rate ofconfession, indictment and conviction? The realities arethese:   -- According to John Kaplan of the Stanford Law School ina November 1987 issue of the American Bar AssociationJournal, suspects confess just as easily when they are giventheir Miranda warnings as when they are not. The more politeand professional the police, the more inclined suspects seemto be to talk, explain or unburden themselves.   -- Empirical studies bear Prof. Kaplan out. In 1981, theOhio State Law Journal reported that field research hasdemonstrated that Miranda has not significantly affected thenumber or rate of confessions, convictions or &quot;clearances,&quot;confessions to crimes &quot;cleared&quot; but not prosecuted.   -- Once prosecutors have confessions in hand, remarkablyfew founder at trial. Newsweek reported in July 1988 thatfewer than 1% of criminal cases are thrown out because ofdefective confessions. Of that 1%, only a fraction werevoided because of noncompliance with Miranda. A 1983 study of260 arrests for robbery in California found that no evidenceat all was excluded on Miranda grounds. Another analysis of2,804 cases in 38 U.S. attorneys' offices revealed that only4.4% of defendants even filed motions to suppress their ownconfessions at trial.   -- Given these studies and statistics, it is notsurprising that the overwhelming bulk of informed opinionaffirmatively favors Miranda or, at least, finds its impactto be neutral. Both former Justice Tom Clark, who dissentedin Miranda, and former Chief Justice Warren Burger, whomPresident Nixon appointed to the Supreme Court, haveexpressed the view -- in a 1989 issue of the University ofChicago Law Review -- that Miranda has not had a negativeimpact on criminal prosecutions. And this acceptance is notrestricted to lofty judges or cloistered academics.   -- Perhaps the best example of how the Miranda decisiondid not turn loose the criminal population is Ernesto Mirandahimself. After the Supreme Court reversed his conviction,Miranda was re-tried without his confession being presentedin court and he was convicted again and re-sentenced, allwithout enjoying a single day of freedom. Indeed, because ofthe scrutiny the Arizona Parole Board gave its most famouspetitioner, Miranda probably served more, not less, time inprison as a result of the Supreme Court's land mark ruling inhis own case. Miranda is anything but a mind less&quot;technicality.&quot; Even if every thing its critics said weretrue, Miranda would still make compelling, constitutionalsense. It all comes down to this: The organized criminal, theeducated and the affluent are almost always aware of theirconstitutional guarantees when they confront the state in acriminal showdown, but there are literally millions offunctionally illiterate, poor and uneducated citizens who donot know what their rights are when the cuffs snap on, thepressure is applied or, as recently happened in Los Angeles,the night sticks strike. More than anything else, Miranda vs.Arizona means that information about our Constitution is nolonger rationed on the basis of wealth, experience oreducation.   Happy anniversary, Miranda vs. Arizona.   ---   Mr. Baird, a lawyer in Phoenix, Ariz., was one of thelawyers who represented Ernesto Miranda in his retrials.</TEXT></DOC>
