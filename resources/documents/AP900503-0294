Genentech, a San Francisco-based biotechnology concern, revealedthe SEC inquiry in a filing of its merger proxy with the agency.   The SEC, as a matter of policy, neither confirms nor denies theexistence of an investigation.   In the filing, Genentech said it understands the inquiry isfocusing on ``certain communications between the wife of G. KirkRaab,'' Genentech's president, and a member of her family beforethe merger agreement was announced.   The filing did not disclose who was involved in the questionedtrades but said they involved ``persons other than Mrs. Raab.''   According to the document, a routine filing required under SECdisclosure rules, Genentech said it and the Raabs have cooperatedwith the investigation and the company said it does not believeeither it or the Raabs is under investigation.   Under the merger agreement, which must be ratified byshareholders at the company's annual meeting June 8, Roche will pay$492 million for control of 60 percent of Genentech.</TEXT></DOC>
