The experimental drug for Kaposi's sarcoma, a skinmalignancy, was one of several new strategies againstacquired immune deficiency syndrome outlined here yesterdayat the Seventh International Conference on AIDS. Among othernew approaches are a gene therapy against AIDS and antidotesfor various enzymes that nourish the virus and help it do itsdamage.</LP><TEXT>   Separately, researchers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute inBoston reported here that certain cells of the body permitthe virus to pass directly through mucus membranes duringsexual intercourse. These cells -- called dendriticLangerhans cells -- are present in the mouth and genitalareas, and may help researchers shed new light on the sexualtransmission of the virus when there are no cuts or abrasionsto allow entry of the virus.   Dr. Gallo said the experimental Kaposi's sarcoma drug,made by Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co. of Tokyo, is still inearly animal tests to check for toxic side effects. However,he said he hoped it would soon proceed to human clinicaltests by his co-workers at the National Cancer Institute. Hemade his remarks after a spirited demonstration by Italiananimal-rights advocates protesting the use of animals inmedical research.   Daiichi has signed a comprehensive research anddevelopment agreement with the National Institutes of Health.Under terms of such a pact, the company would give a supplyof its drug, called SP-PG, to the National Cancer Institute,a unit of NIH, to use in laboratory, animal and humanclinical tests.   An AIDS activist voiced concern about financial profitsfrom the pact between the NIH and a for-profit drug company.   &quot;I don't stand to earn anything,&quot; Dr. Gallo bristled. &quot;Asto what Daiichi could earn, I don't know. . . . I'm not aneconomist. But if it helps {Kaposi's sarcoma} patients,that's what I'll get out of it.&quot;   SP-PG, a natural product made by bacteria in soil, hasreduced the size of Kaposi's sarcoma lesions in mouseexperiments. However, Dr. Gallo warned that the company saidit has production problems making the purified version slatedfor human tests. He said he hadn't any idea what such a drugwould cost.   Gene therapy against AIDS -- long a theoreticalpossibility -- is becoming a more practical pursuit. Dr.Gallo said a coworker, Juliana Lisziewicz, is working on apiece of genetic material that could be inserted into thebone marrow cells of infected people.   Such a maneuver would flood the body with extra copies ofa virus part called TAR. Excess TAR would stick to and blockaction of a viral protein called TAT that is known to triggerreproduction of the AIDS virus.   This so-called &quot;TAR decoy&quot; tactic is attracting otherscientists as well, including Eli Gilboa of MemorialSloan-Kettering in New York, who recently published reportsthat extra copies of TAR could make cells in the test tuberesistant to the virus.   Other researchers have attempted total bone marrowtransplant in AIDS -- so far without success. But Dr. Gallosaid that targeting a specific piece of genetic material forinsertion into the bone marrow's stem cells is a more refinedtool.   &quot;Doing gene therapy vs. total bone marrow transplant islike a precise bullet vs. an atomic bomb that explodes allover,&quot; he said.   Technical hurdles are huge, however. Successfully splicingTAR into bone marrow cells so that it manufactures enough TARto protect against the AIDS virus has proven &quot;very difficultso far,&quot; said Jerome Groopman, an AIDS expert in Boston.   Dr. Gallo also proposed trying to harness a protein calledoncostatin as possible weapon against Kaposi's sarcoma, andtaking aim against an enzyme called ribonucleotide reductaseas another target for an anti-viral drug against AIDS.</TEXT></DOC>
