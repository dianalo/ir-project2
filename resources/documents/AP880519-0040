A group of 80 minority members who advise Dukakis has decided,with his approval, to expand efforts to meet and talk with membersof the Jackson campaign and to lobby black leaders before theDemocratic National Convention in July.   The group will be working to identify possible party platformdifferences _ before the convention can put them in the spotlight.   Also, there is to be a meeting later this month between theMassachusetts governor and about 100 black leaders from across thecountry. And there will be appearances by black Dukakis supportersthroughout the South in the next eight weeks.   The Dukakis group's leader, long-time adviser Joseph Warren,says he and Jackson go way back together.   Warren, a college classmate of Jackson, said in an interviewthis week, ``We went to civil rights fights together, to jailtogether.''   ``We see our role as getting out there now as advance folks,getting out and letting our people know who this man is, much moreaggressively than we have in the past,'' Warren said.   ``We feel that the people who are supporting Jesse Jackson oughtto know who Mike Dukakis is,'' he said. ``That investment at thistime is very important.''   Besides Warren himself, the group of minority Dukakis supportersincludes many black leaders with ties to Jackson aides.   Jackson supporters have threatened to fight delegate-selectionand other rules at the convention. But Warren said he hopedincreased communication between the campaigns would allow Dukakisand Jackson to settle other differences and avoid public feudingthat could alienate black Jackson supporters.   ``We're going to talk unity,'' Warren said. ``But there are onlytwo guys who can make the final deal _ Mike Dukakis and JesseJackson.''   Robert Beckel, Walter Mondale's presidential campaign managerwho handled negotiations with Jackson in 1984, said Dukakis, whospeaks with Jackson at least weekly, appears to have a betterrelationship with Jackson than Mondale did.   ``Jackson believes that Dukakis respects him and that goes along way with Jackson,'' Beckel said. ``It's not a question ofgetting something resolved now but to begin talking about howyou're going to do it.''   Jackson campaign manager Gerald Austin declined comment whenasked if the Jackson campaign would cooperate with Warren and otherblack Dukakis supporters. He said recently that he was speakingfrequently with Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich but thatthose talks have not involved issues likely to arise at or justbefore the convention.   Dukakis has insisted the choice of picking a running mate is hisalone to make, and he is not expected to offer Jackson the No. 2spot on the Democratic ticket.   As his delegate lead has widened, Dukakis in recent weeks hasbeen more forceful in asserting differences with Jackson but stillhas avoided direct criticism of the civil rights leader. Aides sayDukakis is banking on winning the final primaries in New Jersey anddelegate-rich California on June 7 to lessen Jackson's bargainingposition heading into the Atlanta convention.   Some Dukakis aides say privately that they fear a falling-outwith Jackson would cost the Democratic ticket black support itneeds to carry several states in the South. Publicly, however, theaides profess only optimism.   ``We feel strongly that Jesse will come out with us,'' Warrensaid. ``We are looking forward to a fight with George Bush and weare looking forward to locking arms with Jesse Jackson.''   Christopher Edley, issues director for the Dukakis campaign anda White House aide during the Carter administration, refused to saywhether he personally has had recent talks with Jackson aides.   Edley, who is black, did say, ``I share my candidate's optimismthat we will be able to bring the party together without seriousacrimony on any front.''   The meeting between Dukakis and the black leaders, most of themalready Dukakis supporters, is planned for Memorial Day in Boston.Members of Warren's group and other black Dukakis supporters thenwill fan out across the South and to Northern cities with largeblack populations, holding rallies and meeting with black mediaorganizations to discuss Dukakis' record, Warren said.   ``We want to get there early, not wait until after June 7 orafter the convention to sell the Dukakis message and the Dukakisrecord,'' Warren said.   An information package his group has put together says thatwhile minorities make up 6.7 percent of Massachusetts' population,12 percent of Dukakis' judicial appointments have been minoritiesand 13 percent of state workers are minorities.   ``This isn't some Johnny-come-lately that we're all sitting herewindow dressing because the national press is asking `Where is theblack presence around Michael Dukakis.' It's always been there,''said Janet Langhart, a former Boston television personality servingas a Dukakis media adviser.</TEXT></DOC>
