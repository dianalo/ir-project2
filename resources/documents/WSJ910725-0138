Heinz invents apotato-peeling laser.   The new contraption, which features three 25-kilowattlasers costing more than $1 million each, blasts potatoes atthe rate of more than one a second. And the lasers know whenthey've gone too far: They're programmed to stop blastingwhen they reach a surface that's higher in water content thanthe skin. Once the skins are sizzled into carbon dioxide, thecarbon residue is rinsed off, leaving a naked potato.   The method may seem drastic, but it saves money. Heinz nowskins potatoes by dumping them into industrial-sized pressurecookers. When the potatoes are cooked just underneath theskin, the pressure is released, and the skins fall off in anoozy mass that makes fodder for pig farmers.   But the pressure method takes some of the tater with theskin: By the end, the spud could be a dud, having lost 7% to25% of its weight, says Bill McComis, a projects manager atBattelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit research corporationin Columbus, Ohio, that Heinz commissioned to develop thelaser. The laser beam reduces a potato's weight only 4% to5%, and it burns mold off, too. It also works on tomatoes.                                                                                                          Finding Missing Children   By `Aging' Their Photos                                                                                                          COMPUTERS can help find missing children by guessing whatthey might look like now.   The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children isusing equipment made by Sony and QMA, Reston, Va., to turnphotographs of missing children into pictures of what theymight look like years after their abductions.   Some law-enforcement agencies have used similar systemsfor several years, but mainly on adults; aging childrenproduced fuzzy results, and much of the work had to be doneby hand. The QMA system is more automated and &quot;stretches&quot;children's faces to reflect changes in their bone structureas they grow.   The method works best if investigators also have a pictureof an older sibling, preferably at the age the missing childwould be. If not, pictures of parents will do.   Using a Sony scanner, police convert the photos intodigital information that can be read by a computer. Then,using QMA software, the computer merges the younger face withthe older ones. The software knows which features will changewith age. For instance, a child's eyes won't get much bigger,but the head will, and girls' heads stop growing earlier thanboys' heads.   The technology recently helped investigators find KelliAmanda Dominique Barr, who was abducted by her stepfather atthe age of three in 1988. This May, six months after anage-progressed photo of Kelli was distributed nationwide,police found her and her stepfather in Oklahoma. Says RonJones, a case manager at the National Center for Missing andExploited Children: &quot;The picture made him move, and that'show we found him.&quot;                                                                                                          Electronic Eyes Sort   Boxcars at 80 MPH                                                                                                          RESEARCHERS at Carnegie Mellon University have invented anelectronic eye that can sort railroad cars.   Railroad companies currently use human eyes to keep trackof which car is which -- an important detail since not allcars are fit for all trips. A car with aging brakes, forinstance, might not be a good choice to send across thecountry. Other cars are mistakenly sent to the wrong place.   But eyeballing isn't always good enough. Railroad workersoften must squint in poor light or through fog at fadedboxcar numbers and thus misread them.   Commissioned by CSX, Carnegie Mellon researchers inventeda computer that can accurately scan as many as 500 connectedrailcars moving at speeds of as much as 80 miles an hour. Ifa railroad worker can make out the number on a stationarycar, the computer can read it when the car is moving.   If the number has faded, the computer takes ahigh-resolution digital &quot;picture&quot; of the car showing otheridentifying marks, such as dents and rust spots. Then itcompares the information to its memory banks to come up withthe car's number. If it's never seen the car before, someonelater figures out the number and keys it in to the computerfor future reference.   The computers are expected to cost about $50,000 each andwould need to be located at 2,000 to 3,000 sites around thecountry. CMU's head researcher on the project, RobertThibadeau, estimates the system could become an industrystandard within two years if a company steps forward to buildit.</TEXT></DOC>
