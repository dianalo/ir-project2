The nation's federally insured commercial banks earned $3.7billion last year on assets of $3 trillion, down from $17.5 billionearnings in 1986, said L. William Seidman, chairman of the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp.   That amounted to a return on assets of only 0.13 percent lastyear and was the lowest level since the FDIC, which insuresdeposits of up to $100,000, was established in 1934.   The year-to-year drop in earnings was due entirely to largebanks adding to reserves to cover anticipated losses on loans toThird World countries, Seidman said. Nine of the 10 largest banksand 17 of the 25 largest reported a loss for 1987.   ``Absent the extraordinary reserving for (developing country)loans ... net income would have been roughly equal to 1986'slevel,'' Seidman said in the FDIC's bank profile for the fourthquarter of 1987.   Seidman said he believed there was a good chance that bankscould avoid further large additions to reserves for bad Third Worldloans and said, ``The outlook for 1988 is cautiously optimistic.''   ``Barring any new shocks, loan loss provisioning should be lowerthan usual this year, and profitablity at money center and regionalbanks will be much improved,'' Seidman said, predicting that bankprofits this year could return to about the 1986 level.   He also said office occupancy rates and other signs appear toindicate that the economy of the Southwest, which accounted formore than half of last year's bank failures, may have hit bottomand be on the rebound. But he cautioned that much of the region'shealth depends on oil prices remaining stable or rising.   The oil-producing states of Texas, Louisiana and Oklahomaaccounted for 95 of last year's 184 bank failures, the mostrecorded since 1933. Twenty-eight banks have failed in the firsttwo months of this year, 16 of them in the three oil states.   The number of federally insured commercial banks, which isshrinking because of failures and mergers, dwindled from a peak ofabout 14,500 in 1985 to about 13,700 last year, the lowest numbersince 1971.   The results for all of 1987 masked a more positive fourthquarter. Despite loan loss provisions of $7.7 billion for thequarter, banks posted a $3.2 billion profit, 25 percent higher thanthe last quarter of 1986.   Seidman said banks were especially strengthened in the fourthquarter by a flood of new deposits as investors after the Oct. 19stock market crash pulled their money out of stocks and put it intoinsured bank accounts.   The crash also triggered a surge in loan demand from stockbrokerages and other financial service firms, the FDIC chairmansaid. And, because the Federal Reserve pumped money into theeconomy in response to the crash, banks are enjoying lower interestrates.   Another encouraging sign, Seidman said, was the drop from 1,609to 1,559 during the last half of 1987 in the number of banks on theFDIC's problem list.   In addition, the number of banks losing money fell for the firsttime since 1980. The FDIC estimated that 2,366 banks wereunprofitable last year, down from 2,784 in 1986 and 2,453 in 1985.   In a report earlier this week, the FDIC said its insurance fundheld steady in 1987 despite the heavy load of bank failures. Thefund finished the year at $18.3 billion, up modestly from $18.25billion at the end of 1986.   The slight gain was posted despite a provision for thesecond-largest bank rescue ever by the FDIC. Shareholders of FirstCity Bancorporation of Houston are scheduled to vote Friday on arestructuring package that would involve nearly $1 billion ingovernment assistance.</TEXT></DOC>
