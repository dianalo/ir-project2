So she has to be placed into aplastic cage when the missiles rain down. On Friday night, Ilana had to puther in it three times, for two false alarms and a real one.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ISRAELIS' SECOND ROUND OF FEAR  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  War in the GulfSee related stories pages 1A and 17-28A of this section.  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;The baby was told by her mother that the cage is her little house, and shehas to lie inside,&quot; said her grandmother Ruth Shany, 67. &quot;Inside she is quitecontent as her mother tells her stories.&quot;;    Larry and Pippa Derfner liveless than two miles from where the first Iraqi missiles struck Tel Aviv in themiddle of the night. All the next day, they lived in fear of another strike.;   It came the next morning.;    The second attack, on Saturday morning (9:15p.m. PST Friday) was just as terrifying. But it brought relief and resolve.;   &quot;No. 1, it was not gas,&quot; said Derfner, a former correspondent for theJerusalem Post who has lived in Israel for six years. &quot;No. 2, we're going tosmash him now and the world is not going to stand in our way.&quot;;    It was areaction to be expected. And the very reaction Iraqi President Saddam Husseinhas pushed to provoke.;    Worse than the damage inflicted by his antiquatedScud missiles is the fear. That each warhead will carry nerve gas or otherchemical weapons. That the air, the ground, the city will be poisoned.;    TheDerfners, who live in south Tel Aviv, were awakened by the air raid sirenstoday. &quot;We heard sirens and three explosions,&quot; Pippa said. She and her husbandspent half an hour in a sealed room with a bleach-soaked towel stuffed underthe door. Then an announcement came over Israel Radio saying there was nodanger of poison gas.;    &quot;We've just been told we can leave our sealed rooms,and we're going to make a cup of coffee,&quot; Pippa Derfner told the Mercury Newssoon afterward. &quot;It hurts me to say this, but after the first two times, youknow how to handle the situation.;    &quot;We just hope and pray that that crazymaniac is going to die soon.&quot;;    At 7:15 a.m. today in Tel Aviv, with mostresidents still inside, the streets were quiet. The television was playing achildren's program.;    &quot;Yesterday was just awful in that anticipation that itwas going to fall and it was going to be awful,&quot; Larry Derfner said. He pauseda moment, realizing that though he had come through it unscathed, otherIsraelis might not be so lucky.;    &quot;I'm saying all this, but for all I knowsome atrocity happened out there,&quot; he said. &quot;Many people could be dead.&quot;;   (Early reports were of 10 casualties but no fatalities.);    He paused.&quot;There's this whole kind of defiant casualness: 'It's no big deal. I've beenthrough this before.' And also there are a lot of people who are reallyafraid.&quot;;    Derfner was among them.;    &quot;After I woke up and saw that Ipassed the night, I planned to go out and get some cigarettes. I didn't smokeall day yesterday. I was inside. I thought it was safer this morning. Then,first thing -- pow!&quot;;    The attacks have also changed Derfner's politicalviews. He said he used to be a liberal who advocated talks with thePalestinians.;    &quot;I don't even know if I can qualify as that anymore,&quot; hesaid. &quot;Look at these Palestinians. How can they support such a character?&quot;;   But Jews are not the only ones in the line of fire as the imprecise missilesstrike Israel.;    &quot;I'm so scared,&quot; said Samia Sakis, a Palestinian highschool student in Jaffa. &quot;We are all so scared, but what can we do? I can'tspeak. I feel I'm suffocating. I really pray for peace. When? I ask myself.When? We all say: When can we have peace?&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LAURA KURTZMAN AND RUTH MACKAY, Mercury News Staff Writers  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910119  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  23A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  719  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday January 19, 199100019018,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
