SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Amid expressions of concern from two members ofCongress, a Pentagon-appointed ombudsman has left for the Far Eastto look into allegations of censorship and employee harassment atthe Pacific edition of the military newspaper Stars andamp; Stripes.   The ombudsman, Philip M. Foisie, planned to meet with thenewspaper's staff during his trip, as well as with thecommander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, Adm. HuntingtonHardisty, a Pentagon official said Wednesday.   The official spoke on condition he not be named.   Foisie, a former Washington Post editor, was appointed to thepost of ombudsman for the Pentagon's military newspapers earlierthis year, partially in response to the ongoing problems at thepublications.   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said in an interview Tuesday thatcivilian employees have contacted her office with allegations ofcensorship and actions taken against employees who have dealt withCongress about the problems.   ``What we have here is harassment of whistle blowers andcensorship,'' Boxer said. ``It's bad enough to censor the news. Ourmen and women in uniform deserve the news as all of us get it, asharsh as it is. But they're not getting it.''   The General Accounting Office, assisted by the Society ofProfessional Journalists, Sigma Delta Chi, reported last year thatit found evidence of censorship and improper management at thegovernment-run daily paper.   Boxer and Earl Hutto, D-Fla., chairman of the House ArmedServices readiness subcommittee, have written Hardisty, asking himto investigate the situation.   Pentagon spokesman William Hart said the paper's military editorsdeny the claims of censorship and contend they have not been givensolid evidence to back up the allegations.   ``We'll let the ombudsman play his role,'' Hart said. ``Thesenewspapers are essential to the military overseas. If there isevidence of censorship, that needs to come out. But if it is onlyeditorial judgment that is being exercised, that needs to come outtoo.''   In her letter, Boxer cited ``evidence of harassment ofjournalists who have expressed their views to senior management andto members of Congress.''   Boxer cited the cases of Bill Bartman, who was removed from hisposition as the Washington bureau chief of the Pacific edition, andPacific editor Dewey Brackman, who has been temporarily relieved ofhis duties and assigned work as a supervisory editor.   Hutto, in a letter obtained by the Associated Press, said he hadreceived information about ``questionable management and personnelpractices, including continued efforts at news management'' at Starsandamp; Stripes.   The GAO recommended that the editor-in-chief should be a civilian_ rather than a military officer _ with solid journalism credentials.   The House Armed Services Committee, in the defense authorizationbill report for fiscal 1990, said the editor should have solidjournalistic credentials but stopped short of calling for a civilianin the post.   The GAO investigation was launched last year at the request offormer Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis.   Although frequently referred to as one newspaper, the Stars andStripes is published in two separate editions by largely autonomousbureaus in West Germany and Japan.   They were designed to serve as the ``hometown paper'' forAmerican servicemen posted overseas. The papers have a long historythat dates to publication in France during World War I.   The Pentagon describes the papers as ``authorized but unofficialpublications.'' Both operate under a charter to provide ``a freeflow of news and information ... without censorship or newsmanagement.''   Reporters who have worked for the papers say they walk atightrope between reporting the news and satisfying militarycommanders worried about local sensitivities in the host country.</TEXT></DOC>
