About 100,000 people, more than half of them students, defiedpolice and peacefully gathered in the huge square for a festiverally to seek greater freedom, cleaner government, a free press andofficial recognition of the new independent student union thatauthorities say is illegal.   Students held much smaller demonstrations in Shanghai, Nanjingand Changsha, and about 300 journalists from the official Chinesemedia joined the student rally in Tiananmen. Throughout Beijing,crowds of workers applauded the students and shouted encouragement.   ``Perhaps the march will not bring democracy today, tomorrow orthe day after tomorrow, but if we keep working on it, China hashope,'' said one worker who claimed he risked being fired byattending the demonstration.   ``We have to transform China,'' echoed an excited 20-year-oldsophmore from the Political Science and Law College, one of atleast 55 schools that participated in the rally, which capped aremarkable three weeks of pro-democracy student demonstrations inBeijing.   After initially saying the student marches were designed toundermine China's government, the communist leadership in recentdays has said that the demonstrators are being manipulated byunspecified people and that most protesting students are patriotic.   Student activists appeared ready Thursday to shift theirtactics. After six successful marches in defiance of thegovernment, they indicated future activity may not center ondemonstrations. They also announced that a nearly 2-week-oldboycott that shut down most Beijing university classes would endFriday.   Wu'er Kaixi, a leading activist, said setting up independentnewspapers would be among the new steps.   The students _ chanting slogans such as ``Down with officialprofiteering!'' and ``Patriotism is no crime!'' _ poured intoTiananmen in the early afternoon after marching all morning fromtheir universities on the outskirts of Beijing.   At a few intersections, marchers had to shove their way throughhundreds of unarmed police lined six deep across the road, but thegovernment clearly wanted to avoid serious confrontation. Thesecurity presence was smaller than a week earlier, when about150,000 students and supporters marched on Tiananmen.   Although authorities had ordered the square closed Thursday, thepolice who surrounded Tiananmen offered no resistance and quicklyleft when the students arrived.   Red banners bearing slogans and school names soon flutteredabove the square as students sat or milled about, some listening toactivists speak and others seeking shade, soft drinks and gardenhoses for relief from the hot sun. Throughout the afternoon,students ferried countless boxes of popsicles to the sweaty crowd.   The rally ended about 4 p.m., when the students began theexhausting walk back to their schools up to 10 miles away.   ``We haven't achieved our goals yet,'' acknowledged one BeijingUniversity student. ``I think this movement already is significant... but we can't say, `That's it.'''   Students returned to their schools by a different route than theone taken the week before, disappointing workers who crowdedoverpasses along the previous path to cheer the protesters.   Support from the thousands of onlookers was obvious from thebeginning of the day, when they jeered police who attempted toblock the students and warned, ``You're not allowed to hit people.''   Marchers gathered contributions from the crowds and distributedpamphlets explaining their movement. Some students went into thesubway, throwing packets of pamphlets in each car. ``Workers,peasants, soldiers, unite!'' sang other demonstrators as theywalked toward Tiananmen.   One worker captivated marchers from Beijing Normal Universitywhen he grabbed a bullhorn and gave an emotional speech of supportas he rode on the back of a pedicab. ``We should stand up for thenext generation,'' he bellowed in a voice raw from screaming.   And as the students rushed into the square, an opera actor withstained teeth proclaimed: ``This is a big day. I want to be here.''He brought a camera to record the massive protest, as did thousandsof others.   But a strong police presence in Shanghai prevented workers fromjoining a demonstration by about 7,000 students, according to JasonHurtado, an American witness.   In Nanjing, about 1,000 students from three schools marched tothe headquarters of the provincial government, an American witnessreported.   The demonstrations marked the May Fourth Movement of 1919, whichwas China's first student movement. Starting in opposition toconcessions granted to the Japanese government during World War I,it developed into a movement calling for ``Mr. Democracy and Mr.Science'' to save China.   Officially sponsored celebrations to mark the 1919 movement wereheld throughout China. Ironically, hours before the universitystudents invaded Tiananmen, 10,000 youths gathered in the square totake the oath admitting them to the Communist Youth League.</TEXT></DOC>
