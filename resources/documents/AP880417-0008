WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   From Hispanic and Irish wards of the Bronx toJewish crowds in Manhattan, Democrat Michael Dukakis has reveled inthis city's ethnic diversity while urging supporters not to beoverconfident in Tuesday's crucial New York primary.   After a Sunday of campaigning across New York City under abrilliant spring sky, Dukakis was skipping around the state todayto deliver final arguments that he would make the strongestDemocratic presidential nominee.   As he did, Dukakis' organization was concluding two weeks oftelephone calls to a half-million likely Democratic voters in atargeted effort to remind them to turn out when the voting beginsTuesday.   Dukakis' aides were trying to spread their view of the race withJesse Jackson and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. as tightening, although alate poll by Cable News Network-USA Today put Dukakis ahead by 12points.   ``I never talk about polls because I don't pay any attention tothem. I did once and will never do it again,'' Dukakis said, areference to the re-election defeat he suffered after his firstterm as governor of Massachusetts.   On Saturday, standing in a blustery cold in front of chunks ofice floating on Lake Erie in Buffalo, Dukakis offered a reminder ofhis crushing loss in Michigan's caucuses, a 2-1 defeat that had notbeen predicted.   ``What is important is that they vote,'' he said. ``I've beenahead in the polls before, in my own state, and I was way ahead inMichigan, and we all know what happened there.''   His New York campaign director, Paul Bograd, said volunteers hadbeen working 500 to 600 phones a night calling voters in precinctswhere demographic indicators suggest Dukakis should be strong.   After meeting his rivals in their last debate of the New Yorkcampaign Sunday morning, Dukakis walked 25 blocks up 5th Avenuewhere he drew warm cheers from thousands of people who lined thestreets for the city's parade honoring Israel's 40th anniversary.He followed, out of sight of Mayor Ed Koch and Gore, who walkedtogether.   At Gaelic Park in the Bronx, Dukakis threw a ball duringhalftime of an Irish football game _ a rough sport that haselements of soccer and rugby.   He moved into a dance hall at the park as a band and femalesinger shifted smoothly from a Patsy Cline country-blues medley tothe Irish tune, ``Take Me Home To Mayo,'' and Dukakis and his wifeKitty waltzed for the cameras.   Shifting to a Latin beat, Dukakis traveled to another Bronxneighborhood where a band played rhythmically with conga drums andother instruments and the 200 people danced and sang, ``MikeDu-ka-key, pres-i-dent-e.''   With him was Puerto Rico Gov. Rafael Hernandez-Colon of PuertoRico, and each spoke in Spanish to the predominantly Hispanicaudience inside the Club Cubano Americano, where pink paint peeledfrom the walls and stairwell windows were broken out.   Dukakis ``talks our own language,'' the Puerto Rican governortold them, using Spanish.</TEXT></DOC>
