 An emergingtechnology and associated standards, SONet (Synchronous Optical Network), hasonly recently become available, but will eventually allow the full potentialof fibre optic technology to be realized.andM;In addition to specifying a standard fibre optic interface, current worldwideSONet standards specify transmission rates that start at 51.84 Mbps and reachto 2.488 Gbps.andP;  The iong-term ramifications of this standard arefar-reaching: throughout this decade, SONet will gradually replace theasynchronous networks of today.andP;  With essentially the same fibre cable thatsupports asynchronous networks, transmission capacity can be increasedone-thousand fold by using end-to-end SONet equipment.andP;  The cost savings tousers promises to be quite substantial.andM;Cost is only one of several factors in the decision to go with SONet ratherthan propertary fibre implementations such as T3 (44.736 Mbps).andP;  SONet alsooffers:andM;* A standard optical interface -- currently, the conversions betweenelectrical and optical signals are proprietary, and vary among vendors.andP;  Thislimits product selection and configuration flexibility, while increasingdependence on a single vendor.andP;  SONet changes all that.andM;* Network management -- bandwidth may be managed to the DSO (64 Kbps) levelto provide maximum control of bandwidth, regardless of carrier.andM;* Functional support -- complies with B8ZS and ESF signalling formats toinsure optimal network performance.andM;* Fast transmission rates -- 51.84 Mbps to 2.488 Gbps, and can be extended to13 Gbps.andM;* Connectivity -- as the future backbone technology for carrier networks, theuse of SONet equipment provides seamless interconnectivity with a variety ofcurrent and emerging carrier services.andM;SONet, by definition, is reverse compatible with today's T3 networks becauseit can transport DS3 signals.andP;  However, much of the installed base of T3 andhigh-order optic facilities are not capable of being expanded or integratedinto SONet.andP;  Such migrations to SONet would require &quot;fork-lift&quot; conversions.andM;SONet promises true interconnectivity between fibre transmission equipmentvendors, which is a significant improvement over the proprietary fibreinterfaces that currently exist.andP;  With true interconnectivity betweenvendors, users will have more choice in product selection, making it fareasier to implement highly effective system solutions.andM;The basic building blocks of a SONet-compliant private network node includeterminal multiplexer, add-drop multiplexer and fibre transmission systemmodules connected to a SONet-equipped T1 multiplexer under the control of asophisticated transport management system (TMS).andP;  This configuration isexemplified by General DataComm's Megamux-S/TMS, an intelligent networking T1multiplexer equipped with SONet-compliant interfaces.andP;  It is thisconfiguration that provides a smooth migration path from the T1 world intothe SONet world--without prematurely obsoleting the installed base ofcustomer premises equipment.andM;Private networkandM;When the multi-node private network outgrows its T1 (1.544 Mbps) boundaries,the terminal multiplexer becomes the first gateway into the SONet world.andP;  Ina typical point-to-point configuration, a terminal multiplexer at thetelephone company central office is paired with a terminal multiplexer at thecustomer premises, which provides a transparent SONet interface for T1 nodes,placing up to 28 DS1 signals in the SONet payload at 51.84 Mbps.andM;For further networking flexibility, the terminal multiplexer can be combinedwith the add-drop multiplexer to form a multi-point transmission system thatcan add or drop DS1 and/or DSO bundles from the T1 multiplexer nodes alongthe route.andM;The add-drop multiplexer shares high- and low-speed port capabilities withthe terminal multiplexer, but can be equipped to perform DS0 as well as DS1&quot;grooming.&quot;andP;  This means that the add-drop multiplexer can act as a digitalcross-connect system, separating lower-speed signals from the SONet payload.andM;With the fibre transmission system, users can prepare for bandwidthrequirements higher than OC-1 (Table 1).andP;  Depending on the fibre transmissionsystem used, it can transport any combination of up to three STS-1(Synchronous Transport Signal -- Level 1) or DS-3 signals at an OC-3 (OpticalCarrier -- Level 3) line rate of 155.52 Mbps, or transport up to 12 STS-1 cDS-3 signals at an optical OC-12 line rate of 622.08 Mbps.andM;Monitoring and control are handled via an integrated network managementsystem, which provides access to all SONet overhead functions as well asother network management capabilities.andP;  These capabilities include troubleticket administration, customer report generation, multi-level operatorsecurity, and system utilities.andM;The Megamux-S/TMS offers modular packaging design that simplifiesconfiguration, maintenance and repair.andP;  Standardized plug-in DS1, OC and STSinterface cards, other system cards and power supplies are mounted in a steelcard cage to form terminal multiplex, add-drop multiplex and fibretransmission system modules.andP;  These modules plug into subframes (shelves) bymeans of ribbon cables.andP;  This arrangement permits partial removal of moduleswhile still in service and eliminates the need for rear access andinstallation and repair.andM;Businesses must approach SONet the way they approach their entry into newmarkets -- with a well-defined forecast and positioning strategy.andP;  Planningthe timing for and level of commitment to SONet should be though out ascarefully as any new business initiative.andP;  This means that SONet planningshould start with the accumulation of a comprehensive information basecontaining:andM;* carrier technology deployment schedules, including trials;andM;* vendor equipment migration plans (Phase I to Phase II), prototypeofferings, beta test sites, and product rollout schedules:andM;* organizational inventory of highly specialized applications, theiroperating parameters, performance requirements and existing terminalequipment, as well as geographic location;andM;* competitor technology deployment plans, noting applications involved,projected economies and efficiencies, and vendors/carriers involved; and,andM;* progress of international standards bodies, such as CCITT and ANSI.andM;As SONet becomes more widely available and the promised efficiencies and costsavings materialize, it will change the way networks are designed, operatedand managed.andP;  For carriers, timely and effective deployment of SONet willdetermine the types of broadband services that they can offer.andP;  Forcorporations, planning for SONet will determine how the emerging broadbandservices will support new applications, how these applications can beintegrated into various business operations, and within what timeframes.andM;Ray Wroblewski is vice-president and general manager of General DataComm Ltd.andO;in Willowdale, Ont.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
