Stands By Plan for 'Poison Pill' And Special Dividend </HL><SO> </SO><CO> N </CO><DATELINE> TORONTO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Inco Ltd. said that it doesn't plan to modify a U.S.-style &quot;poison pill&quot; and attached special dividend it proposed earlier this month and that it is confident shareholders will approve both.    Though such plans are common in the U.S., Inco's proposal has prompted a wave of criticism among analysts and investors in Canada, where poison pills are rare.    Donald Phillips, Inco's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the big nickel producer has &quot;absolutely no plans of changing&quot; any elements of its plan, which includes a special $1.05 billion payout to holders and a shareholder rights plan -- or poison pill -- that would make a hostile takeover difficult.    &quot;We wouldn't go ahead if we didn't think (the plan) would pass,&quot; Mr. Phillips said. &quot;Unequivocally, we have no plan whatsoever to deviate from what we have proposed.&quot;    Inco's shareholders are expected to vote on the dividend and poison pill next month. Inco said it adopted the plan to ward off predators and address the &quot;value gap&quot; between its strong profit performance and its stock price.    Mr. Phillips said a number of Canadian institutions have privately expressed support for the plan to Inco, though he wouldn't name them. He said he expects U.S. institutions, which are more familiar with such plans, to be more receptive to Inco's. About 50% of Inco's stock is in U.S. hands.    Mr. Phillips conceded that some institutional investors in Canada are &quot;quite worried&quot; that other widely held Canadian concerns could adopt similar plans, and thus reduce the possibility of takeover premiums. But he argued that Inco is unique, because of its high percentage of U.S. shareholders.    &quot;My job is to represent the best interests of Inco's shareholders. I can't address the shareholders of other companies in Canada,&quot; he said.    Inco stock rose 37.5 cents to close at $30.25 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
