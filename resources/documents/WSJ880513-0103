It's easy turning down the ex-convict who wants to market an anti-theft device for Porsches -- which he developed through his expertise in stealing the cars. Another rapid reject is the money-losing San Francisco liquor store that wants $30,000 to buy more booze.    But how do you say no to an emergency shelter for homeless women and children in Detroit, to a plan to help orphans in Uganda, to AIDS research and to a project to support cottage industries in South Africa? So far this year, the Kellogg Foundation has rejected all these worthy proposals -- and hundreds more.    The foundation expects to get 5,000 pleas in 1988. It will probably refuse more than 90% of them. A close look at how the Kellogg staff picks which projects to fund shows the often-mysterious workings of a major foundation and how the business of giving away money changes over time.    While the '80s have seen a mushrooming in the ranks of shop-aholics, there are also more donate-aholics than ever. Many wealthy people and thriving corporations do their giving through private foundations and they have formed 446 of them -- major ones, with assets of at least $1 million -- since 1980. The growth rate of new foundations is 12% higher in this decade, according to the Foundation Center, than in the '70s. This year, 5,148 major private foundations in the U.S. with total assets of about $90 billion will pass out more than $5 billion all told. Some will do so with considerable flair, others with almost no fanfare at all.    Kellogg is among the latter. It is so lowkey that few realize it is the nation's third-largest foundation. Only the Ford Foundation and the J. Paul Getty Trust outweigh its approximately $3 billion in assets. Nearly 60 years after it started operations, its late founder still sets its unpretentious tone. W.K. Kellogg, the &quot;King of Cornflakes,&quot; was a driven, unsmiling, introverted man who started the Kellogg Co. when he was 46 and surprised himself by becoming a millionaire many times over. He arranged for the foundation to remain independent of his company but left it about half the company's stock.    Today the foundation's board doesn't include any Kellogg descendants, but if it did they would feel right at home with the foundation's down-to-earth Midwestern conservatism.    Mr. Kellogg set few rules, but he stipulated that the foundation had to remain in Battle Creek. That has deeply affected the foundation's style. Still a small town, the &quot;Cereal City&quot; today has a population of 50,000. Its low-rise, red-brick downtown smells of corn from the nearby cereal factories. The foundation occupies a low, spare building outside town, but it is preparing to build a $60 million headquarters downtown and to renovate the city's center. Now, boarded-up shops and businesses testify to a decade of Rust Belt decline.    More than 25 years after its founder's death, the foundation still helps ordinary people meet basic needs, and its leaders would also suit Mr. Kellogg. Russell G. Mawby, the foundation's chief executive since 1970, uses words like &quot;golly&quot; and &quot;doggone&quot; and studied horticulture at Michigan State. A slightly paunchy man with big hands, a hearty voice and twinkling eyes, he lives on a farm, where he trained oxen named Yankee and Doodle. It's hard to imagine the head of some elite East Coast foundation saying, as Mr. Mawby does, &quot;There's something therapeutic about going out and tending livestock morning and night.&quot;    The Kellogg Foundation now has only a 35% stake in Kellogg Co., but in the last five years the bull market doubled the value of its diversified portfolio. Still, the practitioner of what has been called shirtsleeve philanthropy has only 92 employees. Preferring straightforward letters, it doesn't even have grant application forms. &quot;We're looking for the germ of a great idea, not someone who's good at grant forms,&quot; says Norman Brown, the foundation's president.    Unless they are addressed to one of the dozen program directors, proposal letters sent to the Kellogg Foundation arrive first at the cubicle of Debbie Rey, a program assistant. Ms. Rey, a relentlessly polite young woman, recalls: &quot;One man sent a letter about radio waves and talking to God. I wrote back that we were sorry, but we don't have a program category that fits his project.&quot;    Because of Mr. Kellogg's concerns, the foundation concentrates its programs in three basic areas: agriculture, health and education. Mr. Kellogg's words, printed on the foundation's front door, say the organization exists &quot;for the application of knowledge to the problems of people.&quot; Thus, the practical Kellogg Foundation has given money to community colleges and rural hospitals, not theoretical physicists.    On a recent morning, the mail yields half a dozen pleas that fall into the foundation's general areas. One group wants $64,000 to set up two rural economic-development councils in Illinois. &quot;We do fund some economic-development programs, but only in Michigan,&quot; says Ms. Rey. &quot;But we do rural programs and they may want to know about this.&quot; She attaches a small routing slip to her boss and to an appropriate program director.    A nonprofit advocacy group for the handicapped wants money to set up a Washington, D.C., office. &quot;We don't pay for things like offices, equipment or cars,&quot; says Ms. Rey. She makes a rejection-letter notation for the word-processing department but, for the record, also sends the request to the person who handles projects for the disabled. A California group wants $325,000 to educate children about drug abuse, but Ms. Rey says it will probably be turned down. &quot;We don't fund just one disease or health problem at a time,&quot; she explains. &quot;We get some tear-jerkers too, like one woman who said she had terrible medical problems and sent a photograph of herself hooked up to all these tubes. We just can't help everybody.&quot;    Also destined for rejection letters on this day: The request by a medical professor in Ireland for a grant to study &quot;global medicine issues&quot; after he retires, and the plan of a British microbiologist to research sorghum disease in Africa.    Program directors eventually review all but the most frivolous proposals. Then the board, which meets monthly, must approve any grant over $50,000. The average grant stretches across three years and totals about $300,000, though grants range from roughly $5,000 to $5 million. The foundation makes about 300 grants a year, and at any one time has some 600 to 700 active projects.    It favors grass-roots efforts to help communities -- mostly in the U.S. and Latin America.    Even worthy ideas may be declined. Perhaps they are too much like another program in the works, or maybe the area is one the foundation is no longer funding: In the early '80s, the foundation gave some 25 grants to develop computer software for farmers, but now universities and commercial concerns provide such programs.    Kellogg is concerned about getting &quot;the most bang for the buck.&quot; An ideal project is one that, if successful, could either be copied elsewhere -- &quot;replicated&quot; in philanthropyspeak -- or will become self-sufficient.    For instance, Rick Little turned to the Kellogg Foundation as a 19-year-old college dropout, after 155 other foundations rejected his idea. He developed a highschool course to teach practical skills like how to balance a checkbook along with helping kids make responsible decisions in such areas as sex and drugs. He asked for $55,000, but Mr. Mawby decided that that wasn't enough and granted $150,000.    That was in 1977. Kellogg gave modest grants to Mr. Little for a decade and now his course, called Quest, is being taught to 1.4 million teen-agers in 29 countries. Quest International has a $15 million budget, which it raises mostly by selling materials to schools. More important, the program has cut absentee and dropout rates and drug and alcohol use in the schools that offer it, while improving academic performance.    Like many foundations, Kellogg singles out its own community for attention: the Chicago-based MacArthur Foundation doles out money in Palm Beach County, Fla., not because of poverty in the area but because that community was important to the founder. In Battle Creek, the $60 million of Kellogg grants since 1931 have been pivotal in keeping the town alive. The foundation donated a community college, an ice rink and various clinics and training programs. But most unusual are the fastgrowing zoo and an 18-mile-long strip of park that winds along rivers and through town; every summer, the foundation pays teen-agers to work on these projects, making them job programs as much as monuments of civic beautification.    Even though the basic focus of the Kellogg Foundation hasn't changed, its staff has a chance at a summer retreat each year to argue for new approaches. At last June's retreat, the staff agreed to recommend funding in six &quot;experimental&quot; areas, including volunteerism and science education. But much of the talk was about the frightening national statistics showing rising drug use, pregnancy and suicide among teen-agers.    The staff and trustees decided that a foundation could try something far more intense and long-term than any government body could. They emerged with a 20-year program targeted to three Michigan communities: Battle Creek, an impoverished rural area and a segment of innercity Detroit. The foundation is now assembling groups of leaders in each community who will dream up a whole series of interrelated projects. The challenge is to try to make each community &quot;the best place in the country to be born into.&quot;    When foundations do change course, it is often due to a changing of the guard at the top. Mr. Brown, who became president of the foundation in January, is a former county extension agent who has run many educational and agricultural programs in developing countries. He has talked the board into making grants in southern Africa. &quot;Frankly, I was concerned that this foundation was looked upon as conservative and not risk-taking,&quot; Mr. Brown says. &quot;I wanted to work in parts of Africa not considered safe.&quot;    After meetings with various African leaders and outside advisers, Mr. Brown delivered some $3.5 million for scholarships to black Africans in five countries, including South Africa, and there is more to come.    Once the money is spent, the hardest task for any foundation is figuring out whether anything was accomplished. Kellogg often includes money for evaluation as part of a grant, and supplies consultants to take surveys. Some goals are more easily measured than others: The foundation counts a local women's clinic a success partly because the infant-mortality rate in the county has dropped. But deciding whether the many Kellogg leadership programs are actually developing leaders is far trickier.    Failures are inevitable. Mr. Mawby cites an effort in the '60s to teach Eskimo men to raise musk oxen, whose fine wool could be knit into expensive sweaters by their wives. The women finally took to knitting. But the men, hunters and fishermen for generations, resisted their lessons in livestock-tending. The oxen developed breeding and disease problems. &quot;It was a cultural contradiction,&quot; says Mr. Mawby. Despite a photo in the 1970 annual report of an Eskimo hugging an ox, Kellogg gave up and put the herd under a professional manager. But the women are still knitting and selling sweaters.    At the Kellogg Foundation, staff members like to say that &quot;money doesn't solve problems; people do,&quot; but they still have to ask themselves, over and over, as they give away their millions: Which problems? Whose solutions?    ---   Ms. Cox covers philanthropy and the arts from The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau.    ---               Kellogg's Largest Grants in 1987                      AMOUNT                    (DURATION GRANT RECIPIENT    OF GRANT)  PURPOSE University of      $5.0       Encourage interdisciplinary   Michigan         (5 years)    scholarship   (Ann Arbor)                    $5.0       Funding for a chemical                    (2 years)    science building                    $2.1       Computerized database of                    (5 years)  libraries in Michigan City of            $4.1       Recreational and cultural   Battle Creek,    (2 years)  facilities   Mich.
