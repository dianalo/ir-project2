But the agency added that ``producers are adjusting gradually,without major liquidations or drops in production.''   Cash receipts from livestock sales are expected to rise slightlyfrom last year's $76.2 billion, but higher feed costs will reducenet incomes.   The commercial slaughter of cows from beef and dairy herdsthrough the end of August remained at about 7 percent below a yearearlier, indicating that no massive herd liquidations occurred ashad been feared earlier when the drought worsened.   ``Even so, this summer's drought likely resulted in some cowsbeing slaughtered ahead of the normal culling period because ofpoor forage conditions,'' the agency said in a new issue ofAgricultural Outlook magazine. ``An even greater increase couldoccur later this year.''   But cow slaughter in the third quarter was expected to be about1.6 million head, down 4 percent from July, August and September1987. Third-quarter increases in cow slaughter are common, and thisyear's seasonal increase was about average for the last five years.   In the fourth quarter, cow slaughter _ a major source ofhamburger and other beef for processing _ also usually increase,but this time the gain is expected to be far less than the 5-yearaverage of 18 percent.   The fourth-quarter slaughter increase slowed to 10 percent in1986 and to 5 percent last year, the report said. This fall'sincrease is also expected to be around 5 percent.   ``Fewer cows going to slaughter, as well as seasonally decliningsteer and heifer slaughter in coming months, should reduceavailable beef supplies during the remainder of the year,'' thereport said.   Market prices of fed cattle dropped to the mid-$60s per 100pounds by late September from more than $71 earlier in the month asmore animals went to slaughter.   ``The relatively strong prices this summer reflected increaseddemand for beef exports and continued strong demand by retail,hotel, restaurant and institutional establishments at a time ofnearly record retail prices,'' the report said. ``Cattle pricescould move even higher during the fourth quarter as beef productiondeclines by up to 10 percent from the summer quarter.''   However, the report added, the rising cattle prices ``are notexpected to push retail beef prices much higher'' because marketingmargins, or the markup between producer and consumer, ``shouldbegin to narrow and a larger share of the consumer's dollar will bereturned to producers.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The public has almost a month to file commentswith the Agriculture Department on a rule-change proposal thatwould allow ``a wider variety of binders'' in processed meat andpoultry.   Binders are additives that act as extenders and to hold productstogether. For example, the proposal would allow such additives in``chili con carne'' and a number of other products.   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's FoodSafety and Inspection Service, said the agency has receivedrequests from a number of companies asking for the rule change.   ``The petitioners have made a reasonable request, consideringthat these binders, including wheat gluten, tapioca dextrin, wheyprotein concentrate and sodium caseinate, are generally approved assafe for use in food, and are already approved for use in manyproducts including spaghetti and meatballs and poultry rolls.''   But the binders are currently allowed in specific meat andpoultry products as part of individual product standards, he said.Under the proposal, the binders would be listed in federalregulations under a table of ``approved substances.''   The listing would name the binders, the products they can beused in, the approved purpose and the use levels.   Interested persons should submit comments by Nov. 7 to: PolicyOffice, Attn: Linda Carey, Hearing Clerk, FSIS, USDAa, Room 3175-S,Washington, D.C. 20250.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Soviet Union says its 1988 grain harvestis almost wrapped up, somewhat ahead of last year when heavy rainsdelayed progress, says an Agriculture Department report.   Soviet watchers in the department's Foreign Agricultural Servicesaid Soviet press reports put the harvest at 93 percent complete asof Sept. 26, with threshing of grain done on 100.9 millionhectares. A year ago, 95.7 million hectares had been threshed bySept. 28.   The USDA has forecast total Soviet grain output this year at 205million metric tons, down from 211.4 million tons in 1987 and 210.1million tons in 1986, but still one of the largest yields on record.   One hectare is about 2.47 acres and a metric ton isapproximately 2,205 pounds.</TEXT></DOC>
