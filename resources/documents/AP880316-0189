The director of state-run Voice of Nicaragua, Caros JoseGuadamuz, put out a nationwide alert calling on the people to``maintain in a state of alert in defense of the neighborhoods,cooperatives, businesses, industries because we can't discount thepossibility that President Reagan will invade Nicaragua in defenseof his mercenaries.''   He said there was ``a direct threat from the White House that wehave to take seriously.''   The radio also said unidentified airplanes were flying over theAtlantic Coastal city of Puerto Cabezas. It said the people were``scared and expected a bomb.''   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said todaythe Reagan administration was considering ``everything ... short ofinvasion'' after national security officials met to discuss what itsaid was a Nicaraguan attack on Contra rebel positions in Honduras.   On Tuesday, about 6,000 Nicaraguan soldiers used helicopters andheavy artillery in a major offensive against Contra rebel forces.   But the Defense Ministry today strongly denied its soldierspenetrated Honduran territory.   ``We have never invaded Honduras and we have never invaded anyneighboring country,'' said a ministry spokeswoman, Maj. RosaPasos. ``So we totally deny those declarations made this morning bythe White House.''   Fitzwater said the Nicaraguan moves amounted to a ``very seriousbreach of regional borders.'' He said 1,500 Nicaraguan troops werealready inside Hondruas and that 4,500 more appeared to be in astaging area to cross the border.   Heavy fighting was reported throughout Nicaragua's 5th MilitaryRegion, which includes Boaco, Chontales, Rio San Juan and ZelayaSouth. The Contras said Sandinista troops had overrun some rebelpositions.   The Defense Ministry said 35 Contra fighters, seven Sandinistasoldiers and one civilian had been killed in the fighting.   A State Department official in Washington, speaking on conditionof anonymity, said on Tuesday that initial reports suggested theSandinistas hoped to deliver a ``knockout blow'' to the Contras.   The Defense Ministry announced Tuesday that the offensive waslaunched last Friday and intensified Monday and Tuesday.   The drive occurred a week before the leftist Sandinistas were tonegotiate with the U.S.-supported rebels about a cease-fire intheir six-year war. Three days of talks scheduled to begin nextMonday in the small southern town of Sapoa, near the border withCosta Rica.   The U.S. House of Representatives defeated a $30 million aidpackage for food and clothing for the rebels two weeks ago, justafter U.S. aid ran out. President Reagan opposed the packagebecause it did not contain military aid.   In a White House meeting Tuesday, Reagan pleaded withcongressional leaders for a renewal of Contra aid, but met an icyreception from Democrats.   Congressional sources, declining to be identified, said Reaganpounded the table and said, ``There are some people around thistable who don't seem to know who the bad guys are down there.''   Nicaragua did not report the offensive until Tuesday evening,when a Defense Ministry spokesman said it was under way but deniedContra claims that Sandinista troops crossed into Honduras, wherethe rebels have bases.   ``The army has undertaken major offensive operations ... Reportsthat the army has penetrated Honduras are not true,'' the spokesmantold The Associated Press in a telephone interview. He cannot beidentified for security reasons.   In December 1986, Honduran warplanes and artillery poundedSandinista troops who had penetrated Honduras to attack Contrabases, and U.S. Army helicopters were brought in to ferry Honduraninfantrymen to the front.   Honduras charged at the time that up to 2,500 Sandinista troopshad gone up to nine miles into Honduras before returning toNicaragua about a week later.   Contra spokesmen in Washington and Miami claimed Tuesday thatSandinista troops entered Honduras in the latest offensive inpursuit of rebel forces.   Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides, a Honduran armed forces spokesman,said on Tuesday he had no information of Sandinista incursions intohis country. ``Nevertheless, tomorrow we will probably be able toreport on the situation.''   President Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras was watching developmentsclosely and a government team ``is monitoring reports on thesubject,'' a Honduran government source said on Tuesday inTegucigalpa, the Honduran capital. The source spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The Contras' clandestine Liberation Radio, in a broadcastmonitored in Managua on Tuesday, claimed the Sandinista army wascarrying out ``genocidal bombardments'' in Chontales, dropping500-and 1,000-pound bombs from helicopters. ``Many peasants had toflee for fear of being torn to pieces,'' the radio said.   Contra leaders said Sandinista forces were knocking the rebelsback. ``They have overrun certain of our positions,'' said ErnestoPalazio, director of the Contras' Washington office.   Sandinista military sources said the offensive involved about6,000 troops and called it ``an important anti-insurgentoperation.''   All sources spoke to the AP on condition they not be identified.</TEXT></DOC>
