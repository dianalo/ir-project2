The ministry said more than 1,000 people on both sides had beenkilled or wounded this year and that the rebels, known as Contras,attacked military or civilian targets 58 times in the first half ofMay alone.   Contra spokesmen denied the claims, accusing Nicaragua's leftistSandinista government of trying through propaganda to avoidcomplying with a regional peace agreement.   Nicaragua's protest was contained in a letter to Secretary ofState James A. Baker III from Jose Leon Talavera, the deputyforeign minister.   ``If the United States is truly interested in advancing toward asolution of the Central American crisis, it should begin byrespecting the will of Central Americans themselves,'' Talaverasaid in the letter, dated May 16.   Barricada, the newspaper of the ruling Sandinista NationalLiberation Front, published the letter Wednesday, and ministryspokesman David Silva said it had been sent to Baker.   Last month, Congress approved $48 million in non-lethal aid tokeep the Contras intact through Feb. 25, 1990, when generalelections are scheduled in Nicaragua.   About 10,000 Contras are in jungle camps in neighboring Hondurasalong with 11,000 family members. Most of the rebels left Nicaraguaafter Contra and Sandinista leaders signed a temporary truce inMarch 1988.   Since then, the Sandinistas have extended the truce unilaterallyon a month-by-month basis and only sporadic skirmishes had beenreported.   Talavera said in the letter, however, that Contras attacked 58times in the period May 1-15. So far this year, he said, theContras had killed 47 civilians, wounded 38 and kidnapped 131.   He said the army had suffered 309 casualties and the Contras 707since Jan. 1, but did not give a breakdown of dead and wounded.   The letter to Baker said the ``account of actions against mycountry is more than enough to show that your government's currentpolicy is not contributing toward peace in Central America.''   Wilfredo Montalvan, a member of the Nicaraguan Resistancedirectorate, denied the letter's claims.   ``The Sandinista regime has always wanted to present the civilwar, which is now suspended, as Yankee aggression,'' he said in atelephone interview from Miami. The Sandinistas use ``that oldtactic ... every time they find themselves in difficulties'' andwant to avoid fulfilling the peace agreement, Montalvan said.   Contra spokesman Jorge Rosales, also in Miami, said 2,000-3,000rebels remain in Nicaragua and have been ``strictly observing thecease-fire.'' He claimed the Sandinista army attacked rebels andtheir sympathizers, but he would not give casualty figures.   Talavera said any aid not intended to dismantle the Contras goesagainst the will of the presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador,Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala and serves to continue the war.   The presidents signed a regional peace pact Feb. 14 in ElSalvador in which Nicaragua promised more democracy and also agreedto draft a plan by May 15 to disband the Contras, most of whom arein neighboring Honduras.   At the request of President Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador,the deadline was extended until an unspecified date in July afterthe inauguration of his successor, Alfredo Cristiani.</TEXT></DOC>
