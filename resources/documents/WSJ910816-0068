Reed was named chairman sevenyears ago, Citicorp was, by almost every measure, America'sleading bank, first in assets, earnings, equity capital andbranch offices. With the pending merger of BankAmerica andSecurity Pacific, it will have forfeited all those titles butone: measured by assets, it remains the country's largestbank. And with merger-minded rivals breathing down its neck,even that is in jeopardy.   For Mr. Reed, once hailed as the whiz-kid of banking, timeappears to be running out to keep Citicorp on top. As anationwide wave of bank mergers dramatically changes thecompetitive landscape around Citicorp, the bank is stillstruggling with problems of the past decade: mounting badloans and inadequate capital. The weakened giant has had tosit on the sidelines while others position themselves for anew era of nationwide banking.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I wouldn't count them out, but they're handicapped,&quot; saysChristopher Mahoney, senior bank credit analyst at Moody'sInvestors Service.   Mr. Reed insists he's up to the challenge, whileacknowledging that he has to move fast to lift earnings andcapital and get Citicorp back into the race. But so far inhis career as chairman, there's little evidence that the52-year-old Mr. Reed can deliver on his latest set ofpromises. Only once during his tenure has Citicorp met itsgoal of a 15% annual earnings increase. A stranger tocorporate banking, he neither checked the runaway exposure tocommercial real-estate loans nor built a capital cushion byselling enough stock when markets were favorable.   Even now, some analysts say his current strategy doesn'tgo far enough. They say Citicorp should be moving morequickly to sell some businesses and tap the equity market fornew capital before merging banks grab the spotlight with newstock offerings. Citicorp executives are &quot;ignoring therealities of the marketplace,&quot; says Charles Peabody, ananalyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. &quot;The longer they wait, theless attractive price they get.&quot;   Mr. Reed contends that &quot;we're moving as fast as we can onall fronts.&quot; Sliding prices are obviously persuading him thatanother large sale of assets or stock should wait at leastuntil Citicorp's earnings are rebounding. That's a gamble, ofcourse, since additional capital raised now could serve as abuffer if Citicorp's loan-portfolio problems turn worse thanexpected.   Citicorp's travails, which led to a slight loss in thesecond quarter, even led Rep. John Dingell to term thecompany &quot;technically insolvent.&quot; His comment, at a hearingearlier this month, was quickly refuted by Citicorp andbanking regulators and, after press reports of the remarksparked a brief run on some Citicorp branches in Hong Kong,Mr. Reed complained to the Michigan Democrat.   The bank's problems and its dim prospects for a quickreturn to high profitability have fueled speculation on WallStreet and among former Citicorp executives that its boardmight dump Mr. Reed.   And yet, his most important constituents -- Citicorp'sboard members -- seem confident that this time, Mr. Reed hasfound the right formula. At the May board meeting in MexicoCity, Mr. Reed asked for and received full support during atwo-hour session with outside directors, according to oneparticipant. That duplicated a similar endorsement he got forhis plans, just before that meeting, from regulators inWashington. Mr. Reed declines to comment on the reports.   Mr. Reed has set a course that ultimately will dismantlemuch of the bank's huge bureaucratic structure. So far, thebank has cut its world-wide payroll by 5,000, to 90,000,mostly by thinning management ranks. Mr. Reed has said thatbefore 1993 another 10,000 employees, some from the sale ofperipheral businesses, are likely to go.   Even as he displays a new bottom-line consciousness, Mr.Reed remains the visionary who has long dazzled morepedestrian banking colleagues. He now talks of runningCiticorp like a new-age industrial company with thin layersof management, peer-review evaluations, far fewer meetingsand &quot;judgment&quot; replacing a lot of three-year plans &quot;that noone ever looked at anyway.&quot;   Mr. Reed maintains that Citicorp is on the mend. Itsexpenses in the first half showed what he calls an annual&quot;run rate&quot; of $10.05 billion, which is $750 million lowerthan last year's total. At the same time, Citicorp raised$1.25 billion of equity capital through two privateplacements and got the equivalent of another $800 million ofequity capital through the sale of 50.3% of its Ambacmunicipal-bond insurance unit.   Although still one of the least-capitalized major banks,Citicorp now, at least, has crossed the 4%-of-assetsthreshold of basic equity capital that regulators insist onby the end of 1992. He wants to increase that capital fromthe present $8.9 billion to well over $12 billion by the endof 1993. More than half that increase would stem from a risein retained earnings, with cost cutting playing a major role.   But although Citicorp's assault on expenses has producedimpressive numbers, it is off to a slow start in meeting someother goals. The sale of the Ambac stake brought at least$100 million less than investment bankers had anticipated,and they say other salable assets, such as a piece of thelucrative credit-card operation, aren't likely to fetch whatthey were worth earlier in the year.   Moreover, the cost of writing off and carrying troubledloans is running 25% higher than expected, primarily becauseof rising delinquencies in the consumer credit-card andmortgage portfolios, Mr. Reed says. As a result, ThomasHanley, a bank analyst at Salomon Brothers, sees Citicorphard pressed to earn its $1-a-share dividend on common thisyear, let alone have anything left over to add to capitalfrom retained earnings. Next year's prospects will dependheavily on global economic growth and stable asset values, headds. &quot;The things that are hurting John Reed now are not ofhis own making; they're external events,&quot; Mr. Hanley says.   Brent Erensel, an analyst at Mabon Securities, seesCiticorp &quot;in a race against time. While there is clearevidence of revenue/expense margin improvement, can itoverpower loan-asset problems? For the near future, we don'tthink so, but over five years, there's reason for optimism.&quot;   Mr. Reed says his &quot;objective, by the end of next year, isto grow our operating margin between revenues and expensesfrom $4.5 billion {in 1990} to more than $7 billion.&quot; Incomparison, the margin before consideration of problem loansand taxes for the proposed union of BankAmerica and SecurityPacific is $5 billion, and it would hit $6 billion if themerged institution meets its cost-cutting objective.   Once Citicorp succeeds in raising its operating margins,Mr. Reed says, &quot;We will have the ability to eat sustainedcredit losses and add to retained earnings.&quot; The surge inretained earnings could be massive once the present rate ofloan charge-offs and related expenses dwindles. This year, inthe commercial sector, that cost is expected to be about $1.6billion, four times its level several years ago. Mr. Reedsays he is managing as if the problems in the loan portfolio,which include rising consumer-debt delinquencies, will remainnear present levels for several years.   The progress that Citicorp has made isn't going unnoticed.&quot;I'm more impressed with John Reed over the past year thananytime since he took over in 1984,&quot; says Salomon's Mr.Hanley, a frequent critic of Citicorp. Mr. Hanley adds thatit &quot;probably has done the best job of any major bank inexpense management.&quot;   While the BankAmerica merger's impact on Citicorp will belimited initially to greater competition in the Western U.S.and the Far East, where both Security Pacific and BankAmericaare powerful, the proposed union of Chemical Banking Corp.and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. will increase competitionin consumer banking in Citicorp's home town. However, Mr.Reed observes that size alone means little unless thecombined bank can succeed in cutting hundreds of millions ofdollars of duplicative costs.   &quot;They're setting out to do in cost cutting what we arealready well into. And I'd say we have the advantage becausewe all know each other.&quot; He has a point: Studies show thatmergers among relative equals, such as theBankAmerica-Security Pacific and Chemical-Hanover deals,often yield fewer efficiencies than expected.   Even so, Mr. Reed says he envies the powerful allure suchcombinations can have on potential stock investors. Althoughhe says he doesn't plan now to engage Citicorp in mergerdiscussions, even if he got regulatory clearance, &quot;the bestargument I've heard for us to merge is to take advantage ofthat immediate euphoria to raise capital.&quot;   Mr. Reed says Citicorp wouldn't have been a bidder in anyof the recent deals because they all involve heavycommitments to middle-market corporate lending, whichCiticorp shuns. Richard Braddock, Citicorp's president, addsthat Citicorp may even turn out to benefit from missing thecurrent wave of mergers. &quot;Bankers are like lemmings: A lot ofthem will go careening into mergers that won't work,&quot; hesays. When Citicorp has a stronger balance sheet, &quot;there'sgoing to be an Act 2,&quot; with new opportunities emerging.   But Mr. Reed freely admits mistakes. Though defending thebank's evaluation of individual loans, he says: &quot;We did nothave within the company overall portfolio management&quot; thatconsidered the portfolio mix. He adds, &quot;I've spent a lot oftime trying to understand what happened.&quot;   Another part of the problem, he believes, is that &quot;we soldourselves on the notion that we were better than we were.&quot; Inaddition, he says, &quot;One of the flaws of American managementis that it is results-oriented. We published that we wantedto grow earnings at a rate of 15% or better, and that becamea driving force. The B-School kids, of which I was one,managed by turning the dials.&quot; That numbers orientation, heexplains, &quot;made real-estate guys afraid to turn in&quot;projections below the prior year's results.   Now, Mr. Reed seeks to head off such disasters whileretaining the bank's full presence in the individual,institutional (including corporate) and investment-bankingbusinesses. He also has identified more than a dozen businessunits that might be sold in whole or part. But althoughQuotron Systems, the electronic stock-quote service thatCiticorp bought for $680 million in 1986, has lost money foryears and isn't one of the bank's main businesses, Mr. Reedsays it isn't on the auction block.   With Citicorp retaining its commitment to its corebusinesses while continuing to fund expansion in manyperipheral areas, such as opening consumer branches inConnecticut and Japan, some analysts wonder whether it shouldcontinue to try to be all things to all people in bankingservices. Shouldn't it cash in on some of the profitablebusinesses now? they ask.   Most banks &quot;under duress,&quot; Mr. Reed replies, leave majorbusinesses and markets. &quot;What we're doing is more gutsy.&quot; Hisapproach includes avoiding across-the-board personnel cuts,leaving all customer contacts in place and trimming middle-and upper-management positions.   By centralizing human-resources, legal and financialfunctions, for instance, he is eliminating not only thoseexecutive functions at more than 100 separate business unitsin at least half of the 93 countries where Citicorp operates,but their supporting staffs as well. He cites the eliminationof five executive vice presidencies in the internationaldepartment, which also cut about 600 staffers who hadreported to them. However, he is said to have told Citicorp'sboard that he intends to strengthen top management bybringing in another senior executive.   Mr. Reed also is trying to instill a new approach to goalsetting. It includes peer-review teams that will evaluate abusiness unit and its managers, not from an auditor's stanceof whether growth objectives were met but rather through moresubjective measures, such as service quality, managementsuccession and product positioning in the market.   And he wants meetings to take up &quot;sets of alternatives,not just a story justifying whatever argument is beingpitched.&quot; He adds: &quot;I'm a great believer in looking atoutlandish positions as well. The other day I threw peopleout of a meeting because they came in with a proposition thatwas carefully designed to lead us through a single door.&quot; Asmuch as 80% of meetings are useless anyway, he maintains.   Mr. Reed sees no letup, at least through next year, in theloan problems. He criticizes regulatory examiners because, bydemanding that loan assets be marked to current market value,&quot;we're being asked to provide for tomorrow's risks withoutaccounting for any of tomorrow's benefits.&quot; Adding tocredit-quality problems, he believes, is a &quot;fundamentalrepricing of whole classes of assets around the world&quot;because real interest rates are twice real growth rates. Thisdeflationary pressure will keep driving down asset values forseveral years, he predicts.   With that in mind, Mr. Reed has discarded Citicorp'straditional view that excess capital is merely excess idlefunds. Besides, he adds, &quot;I know when I've been beaten; themarkets now want capital.&quot;   However, neither Mr. Reed nor Paul Collins, his vicechairman in charge of capital raising and financial controls,is in any rush to sell assets or stock, as analysts arerecommending. &quot;We raised $1.25 billion earlier this year; noother bank has come close to that,&quot; Mr. Collins says. Headds: &quot;We're making continual progress on capital. Unlesssomething changes, I see no reason to pop out equity betweennow and the end of the year.&quot; Similarly, he says, &quot;We'vepulled back for now&quot; on an initial public offering of part ofthe credit-card operation, partly because of alower-than-expected price.   Where Citicorp wants Wall Street's help is in selling offsome of its more than $4.1 billion of nonperforming andforeclosed commercial real-estate assets. William Rhoades,another vice chairman and a man known for devising novel waysto deal with the less-developed countries' debt, is spendingpart of his time working with Mr. Reed on problem realestate. &quot;If we can package this stuff and securitize it, Ithink a market will spring up just as in LDC debt,&quot; Mr.Rhoades says.   Dealing with such day-to-day problems isn't what Mr. Reed,who has often been described as a visionary thinker, prefers.He comments: &quot;I hate every minute of what I have to do.Please don't think this is fun and games. But we will be amuch stronger institution than we otherwise would have been.&quot;And although he has vowed to keep his horizons short,concentrating on only 1991 and 1992, &quot;I still keep my eye ontwo long-term projects.&quot;   One is the portion of the proposed banking legislationthat would allow industrial companies to own banks. In lightof a recent court decision allowing regional phone companiesto transmit information services over their lines, he wasrecently lobbying in Washington in favor of theindustrial-company idea in case Citicorp someday wants tolink up with a phone company. &quot;We can't compete with theseguys,&quot; he says. &quot;It costs $450 a year to serve a bankingcustomer in a branch, roughly $20 through a credit card andonly $10 over a phone line.&quot;   Mr. Reed's other pet project is to monitor Citicorp'soptions for possibly moving its headquarters to anothercountry, where the regulatory and capital-raising climatewould be more favorable to its mix of business. &quot;The UnitedStates is the wrong country for an international bank to bebased,&quot; he said.   Although Citicorp isn't likely to pack its bags anytimesoon, exploring the idea reflects his penchant for alwaysconsidering alternatives. In the same vein, he says that onhis way to the West Coast, he will visit Omaha next week tomeet, for the first time, Warren Buffett, the billionaireinvestor who recently gained Federal Reserve Board clearanceto buy up to 22% of Wells Fargo Co. stock.   Mr. Reed says there is nothing more to the visit than thesuggestion from a friend, Thomas Murphy, former chiefexecutive of Capital Cities Broadcasting Co., &quot;that I shouldmeet Mr. Buffett because I would find him fascinating. I alsolike a good steak.&quot; In any event, Mr. Reed says, &quot;I doubtWarren Buffet is going to buy 22% of Citicorp.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
