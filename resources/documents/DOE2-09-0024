<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-09-0024 </DOCNO><TEXT>InP/CdS cells have been produced by the thermal evaporation of CdS onto1 x 1 cm single crystals wafers of InP. The acceptor concentration ofthe wafers used varied from 10/sup 15/ cm/sup -3/ to 10/sup 18/ cm/sup-3/ and the optimum was found to be in the mid 10/sup 16/ cm/sup -3/range, giving cells with efficiency over 15% (AM1.5). The behaviour ofcells with mid 10/sup 16/ cm/sup -3/ doped InP under variations of temperatureand irradiance is discussed and a model of the heterojunction is presented.5 figs., 6 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
