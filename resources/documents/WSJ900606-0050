The civil suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan,accuses Alan C. Goulding, formerly an Aandamp;P senior executivevice president and chief operating officer, of passing oninside information that the others used in purchasing stock.The insider-trading scheme allegedly lasted from May 1986through March 1987. Mr. Goulding allegedly tipped the otherdefendants off about Aandamp;P's plans to acquire Shopwell Inc.,Delchamps Inc., and Waldbaum Inc., as well as tipping themoff about higher-than-projected Aandamp;P earnings.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Goulding, 60 years old, of Allendale, N.J., and theother defendants signed consent orders settling the case. Inthe consent orders, the defendants neither denied noradmitted any wrongdoing. The other defendants are Robert J.Foley, 68, a food-marketing consultant in Redwood City,Calif.; Joel Lopate, 56, of Miami; Murray Verlin, 68, partowner of a food-distribution company, of Miami; Kurt Goldman,65, of Boca Raton, Fla.; and Peter Goldman, 62, also of BocaRaton.   In the consent order, the defendants agreed to turn overalleged insider-trading profits totaling $513,881, plusinterest of $189,880. They also will pay penalties totaling$1.3 million. Mr. Goulding, who isn't accused of trading onthe inside information, will pay a penalty of $635,000, thelargest portion of the disgorged profits and penalties.   Michael Himmel, an attorney for Mr. Goulding, said hisclient left Aandamp;P for health reasons, and that he settled thecase in order to put it behind him.   An Aandamp;P spokesman said Mr. Goulding's departure from Aandamp;Phad nothing to do with the SEC allegations. He said the SEC'sinvestigation began after Mr. Goulding had taken earlyretirement in July 1987.   Pamela Rogers Chepiga, an attorney for Kurt Goldman andPeter Goldman, said she doesn't believe her clients committedinside trading because they received their informationsecond-hand, rather than directly from Mr. Goulding. But shesaid the two men decided that the settlement &quot;waseconomically advisable.&quot;   Lawrence Horn, an attorney for Mr. Lopate, declined tocomment. Attorneys for the other defendants couldn't bereached for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
