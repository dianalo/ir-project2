Vice Minister for Economics Chiang Pin-kung sighsthat &quot;it's very difficult to get away from Japan&quot; andcomplains that there are &quot;a lot of barriers&quot; to foreignersselling in Japan. Foreign Minister Frederick Chien warns thatJapan's business practices encourage lingering Asian fears of&quot;the rejuvenation of the military imperialism of Japan.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Why is there so much negative talk about Japan in acountry where many people still speak Japanese and harborfond memories of the pre-1945 period when Japan was Taiwan'scolonial master?   On the surface, the problem is Taiwan's trade deficit withJapan, which jumped 10% last year to $7.66 billion, more thanthree times the 1985 level. But the more fundamental problem,in the opinion of the Taiwanese, is the nature of thedeficit. About half of America's $40 billion annual tradedeficit with Japan is accounted for by one finished consumerproduct -- Japanese autos. By contrast, all consumer productscombined make up only 10% of Taiwan's imports from Japan; therest consists of parts, components and machinery.   In other words, it is Taiwan's industry rather thanconsumers that is hooked on Japanese products. The same istrue in many countries, but nowhere is it more of a problemthan in such newly industrialized economies as Taiwan.   As a country of only 20 million people with a fairlyrecent industrialization, Taiwan has many gaps in itsindustrial structure. It manufactures some things very wellbut others not at all, including a lot of machines, parts andother things needed to make what it does make.   Because the Japanese are very competitive in this area andbecause many Taiwan businessmen speak Japanese and arefamiliar with Japanese business practices, the parts andmachinery tend to come from Japan. Thus, when Taiwanincreases its exports of manufactured goods, it alsoincreases its imports from Japan.   For a country with an overall trade surplus of $13billion, a deficit with one country isn't an enormouseconomic burden. But Taiwan is embarking on a six-year, $300billion infrastructure spending plan that is expected toboost domestic demand and reduce its trade surplus to about$4 billion by 1996. But unless Taiwanese industry reduces itsreliance on Japan, the deficit with Japan may continue towiden.   Some Taiwanese also worry that being dependent on Japanfor intermediate goods makes it difficult to compete withJapan in finished goods, something that newly industrializedcountries increasingly must do. If the Japanese company thatsupplies a critical component for a Taiwan finished-goodsmaker also supplies the same component to its Japanesecompetitors, who will get faster delivery during a time ofheavy demand?   R.C.T. Lee, dean of academic affairs at National Tsing HuaUniversity, worries about Japan's growing monopoly in thefield of semiconductor-making equipment. &quot;It's quite criticalto the world who controls these semiconductor machines,&quot; Mr.Lee says. &quot;If the Japanese refuse to sell the equipment,you're lost.&quot;   Theoretically, one solution to the trade deficit would befor Taiwan to export more finished goods to Japan. But lastyear, Taiwan's exports to Japan fell to $8.34 billion from$9.06 billion in 1989 and were even below 1988's $8.77billion.   The trend in 1987 and 1988 that saw many Japanese eagerlysnapping up Taiwanese and South Korean products is over.Japanese companies appear to have stymied their competitorsin the newly industrialized economies at both ends of theproduct spectrum. For sophisticated products, Japanesecompanies say privately they are actually widening theirtechnological lead. For cheaper products, the Japanese haveoutflanked Taiwan and Korea and built factories in SoutheastAsia to take advantage of lower-cost labor.   Another partial solution would be to buy more American andEuropean parts and components. But many Taiwanese businessmensay the Americans and Europeans either don't make what theyneed, charge more for it or don't have good service networksto repair it. Even when Western industries offer qualityproducts at competitive prices, the overall Japanese packageis often considered to be better, taking into account factorssuch as after-purchase service.   Still another solution would be for Taiwan to lessen itsreliance on Japanese components by upgrading its technologyand filling the gaps in its industrial structure. Thegovernment has numerous programs aimed at doing just that,but progress is slow. So Taiwan is pressuring Japan to helpit achieve those ends by transferring more technology.   Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry saidlast week it was considering a technology-transfer policy toease the growing trade imbalance. No strategy has beendecided yet, but one approach, MITI said, would be to havefactories in Taiwan make Japanese-designed semiconductors andother high-technology products.   Meanwhile, Japanese investment in Taiwan is growing.Taiwan government approvals of Japanese investment jumped 26%last year to $839 million, and companies, including SonyCorp. and Matsushita, are locating research facilities inTaiwan. Canon Inc. makes a third of its cameras in Taiwan,and exports 20% of those back to Japan.   But transferring technology is difficult, the Japanesesay, because companies in Taiwan are fixated on short-termprofit, spend little on research and development, and thushave a limited ability to absorb sophisticated technology.Some Taiwanese concede there is merit to the Japanese concernabout Taiwan's ability to further develop transferredtechnology.   &quot;The burden is still on our side,&quot; says Eric C.Y. Huang,special assistant to the chairman of Teco Electric andamp;Machinery Co. Teco, a Taipei electrical-equipment maker, hasobtained technology from Japan, the U.S. and Europe andcompetes successfully with Japanese companies inair-conditioners and other products.   Still, government officials worry that this year, for thefirst time in 10 years, Taiwan's trade deficit with Japanwill surpass its trade surplus with the U.S. And that,officials fear, will spark intense criticism that thegovernment isn't being tough enough with Japan.   Other Taiwanese are annoyed by what they assert is theassumption in Japan that nothing Taiwan makes is good enough.They feel Japanese companies have propagandized Japaneseconsumers to believe this in an effort to keep out foreignproducts.   &quot;The Japanese people are brainwashed,&quot; says Paul C. Chang,president of Primus Capital Group, a direct-investment fund.&quot;They really believe Japan manufactures superior products.They are 60%-to-70% right, but they are 30% wrong.&quot; BonnieKao, a vice president of an American bank's Taipei office,says, &quot;With their kind of culture, I don't think they're evergoing to buy from anyone else.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
