Mr. Brookes's case is based upon his claim that the welfare caseload in our state has gone up while ET has been in place and that, therefore, ET is a waste. But in fact the caseload has gone down. In October 1983, the start of ET, those receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children stood at 88,500. As of Dec. 31, 1986, the figure was 84,700, a drop of 4.4%. And of the 84,700 adults now on welfare, 8% are working (most in part-time jobs) and receive some benefits to supplement their wages. Some 3,000 are attending community colleges and preparing to enter the work force and leave the welfare rolls.    Since December 1982, the averge length of stay on AFDC has decreased 29% -- one full year -- much of it attributable to ET. The average length of stay has declined from 40 months when I took office to 28 months today. Best of all, the greatest reduction under ET -- 25% -- has been among those who have been on welfare five years or more. Moreover, the number of two-parent welfare families has been cut in half.    Were it not for ET, our AFDC caseload would be as high as 100,000 because we have also raised welfare benefits by 32% over the past four years to help poor families pay for rent, utilities, clothing. That is because under federal rules an increase in benefits expands the number of families eligible.    We pay for the benefit increases with the money saved through ET. For every person who goes off welfare through ET, we save nearly $8,000 in AFDC, food stamps and Medicaid benefits.    After deducting all the costs of running the program, we estimate that ET has saved more than $100 million in 1986 as a result of a combination of reduced welfare benefits and increased revenue -- state and federal income taxes, sales tax and Social Security payments.    The women (almost all of the people on welfare in Massachusetts are single mothers with children) who have found jobs because of ET speak passionately about the way their lives and their children's lives have improved. I received a letter from one of our first ET graduates, Doris Pineo, who wrote, in part: &quot;How do you say 'thank you' to someone who has given you a will to live and helped you gain back your self-respect?&quot;    We don't club people off the welfare rolls into dead-end, make-work jobs because the only future in those jobs is dependency and a return to the welfare rolls. ET has placed more than 30,000 welfare recipients and applicants into good jobs, at decent pay, with a future. The average starting wage for ET graduates in full-time jobs is $12,000, more than twice the average welfare grant. And 86% of our ET graduates who leave the welfare rolls are still off one year later.    We have one very successful approach in Massachusetts. But there are others in other states modeled closely after what we started. Many of those programs will be discussed at the end of this month at the annual mid-winter meeting of the National Governors' Association in Washington during a session devoted exclusively to welfare reform.
