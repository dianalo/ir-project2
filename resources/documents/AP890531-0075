First therewas the vision, the concept of free peoples in North America andEurope, working to protect their values. And second, there was thepractical sharing of risks and burdens in a realistic recognitionof Soviet expansionism.   And finally, there was the determination to look beyond oldanimosities. The NATO alliance did nothing less than provide a wayfor Western Europe to heal centuries-old rivalries, to begin an eraof reconciliation and restoration. It has been, in fact, a secondrenaissance of Europe.   As you know best, this is not just the 40th birthday of thealliance. It's also the 40th birthday of the Federal Republic _ arepublic born in hope, tempered by challenge. At the height of theBerlin crisis in 1948, Ernst Reuter called on Germans to stand firmand confident. And you did _ courageously, magnificently.   The historic genius of the German people has flourished in thisage of peace, and your nation has become a leader in technology,the fourth-largest economy on Earth. But more important, you'veinspired the world by forcefully promoting the principles of humanrights, democracy and freedom.   The United States and the Federal Republic have always been firmfriends and allies, but today we share an added role: partnersd inleadership. Of course, leadership has a constant companion _responsibility. And our responsibility is to look ahead and graspthe promise of the future.   I said recently that we're at the end of one era and at thebeginning of another. And I noted that in regard to the SovietUnion, our policy is to move beyond containment.   For 40 years, the seeds of democracy in Eastern Europe laydormant, buried under the frozen tundra of the Cold War. And for 40years, the world has waited for the Cold War to end. And decadeafter decade, time after time, the flowering human spirit witheredfrom the chill of conflict and oppression. And again, the worldwaited.   But the passion for freedom cannot be denied forever. The worldhas waited long enough. The time is right. Let Europe be whole andfree.   To the founders of the Alliance, this aspiration was a distantdream. And now it's the new mission of NATO. If ancient rivals likeBritain and France or France and Germany can reconcile, then whynot the nations of the East and West?   In the East, brave men and women are showing us the way. Look atPoland, where Solidarity ... and the Catholic Church have won legalstatus. The forces of freedom are putting the Soviet status quo onthe defensive.   In the West, we have succeeded because we've been faithful toour values and our vision. And on the other side of the rustingIron Curtain, their vision failed. The Cold War began with thedivision of Europe. It can only end when Europe is whole.   And today, it is this very concept of a divided Europe that isunder siege. And that's why our hopes run especially high, becausethe division of Europe is under siege, not by armies, but by thespread of ideas that began here, right here. It was a son of Mainz,Johannes Gutenberg, who liberated the mind of man through the powerof the printed word. And that same liberating power is unleashedtoday in a hundred new forms.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
