Col. Ralph Hayles as a result of a&quot;friendly fire incident&quot; in the Persian Gulf War.   Col. Hayles was stripped of command and forced into earlyretirement last month because of the Feb. 17 incident, whenhe fired two Hellfire missiles at what he mistakenly believedto be two Iraqi armored vehicles. Two U.S. servicemen died,and Col. Hayles became the only American to have beendisciplined for a friendly fire incident during the war.</LP><TEXT>   The Army has insisted Col. Hayles was cashiered largelybecause of an unusual guideline in his unit -- the FirstInfantry Division -- that officers of his rank should bemanaging, not firing.   But Army officials now concede the guideline in the FirstInfantry Division was a merely verbal directive that implieda certain flexibility. Maj. George Rhynedance, a Pentagonspokesman, said, &quot;There's always flexibility in how thecommander's intent is accomplished. You have to not limit thecreativity and initiative of subordinate commanders orleaders.&quot;   But Maj. Rhynedance stopped short of saying Army officialserred in disciplining Col. Hayles, and he said there aren'tplans for a military review of his case.   Col. Hayles has unsuccessfully appealed his dismissal withArmy officials. His appeal of his final efficiency report bya supervisor is still pending.   The Army's apparently softened interpretation came afterquestions about Col. Hayles's counterpart in the 101stAirborne Division -- Lt. Col. Dick Cody. Although Col. Cody,also the commander of an Apache battalion, wasn't involved infriendly fire, he too led his helicopter gunships into battleand fired rockets in a raid on an Iraqi radar site. Col. Codywas awarded the Air Medal, while Col. Hayles was stripped ofcommand and sent home in disgrace.   Congressional investigators are questioning the apparentdiscrepancy, among other things, in their inquiry into theArmy's handling of the Hayles friendly fire incident.   The First Infantry's guideline was rare and possiblyunique among the nine major U.S. combat units in Saudi Arabiaat the time, Army officials said. The Army says that Col.Cody fired rockets and his 30mm cannon while leading theattack on an Iraqi radar site.   Some Apache pilots who flew with Col. Hayles say he is ascapegoat singled out for discipline to narrow the focus ofthe friendly fire investigation -- thus protectinghigher-ranking officers who ordered helicopters up in ablinding sandstorm to hunt targets too close to allied lines.The pilots also say he is taking blame that should go partlyto faulty equipment on the Apache that may have contributedto the tragedy.   Videotapes recorded internally by Col. Hayles's Apaches,disclosed in a front-page story in this newspaper on Nov. 7,show that he tried to fire his 30mm cannon before he engagedthe Hellfires, and it jammed. The timing is crucial becausehad Col. Hayles been able to use his cannon before shootingthe missiles, the armored vehicles might have had time toidentify themselves as American.   The General Accounting Office, Congress's investigativearm, is questioning suspected flaws in the Apache'snightseeing infrared device, navigation equipment and itscannon. The performance of the Apaches -- which cost about$10 million each -- has long been a concern to the GAO.Public embarrassment over the helicopter's role in thecontroversial friendly fire incident could play a part indelaying Pentagon plans to make expensive upgrades to itsApache fleet, military officials said.   Ironically, McDonnell Douglas Corp., manufacturer of theApache, is touting the exploits of Col. Cody. It reprinted afavorable article about him in the April issue of Soldiersmagazine, an Army publication. The company's latest Apachenewsletter also includes a feature story on Col. Cody,headlined, &quot;Out With a Bang.&quot; He recently left the 101stAirborne for a senior staff post at the Army's TransportationCenter at Fort Eustis, Va.   ---   Rick Wartzman contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
