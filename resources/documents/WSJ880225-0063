Degussa, a precious-metals and chemicals group, owns 35% of Nukem, a nuclear-materials processor whose Transnuklear G.m.b.H. transport unit is being investigated for suspected bribery of power-industry officials and breaking rules when shipping and storing radioactive waste.    Degussa Chairman Gert Becker told an investigating panel of the Hesse state legislature on Tuesday that Degussa's senior tax expert had detected &quot;irregularities&quot; in Nukem's accounts early in March 1987.    Mr. Becker was informed of the internal finding on March 25, according to a Degussa spokesman. Mr. Becker said the Degussa executive advised Nukem management against prosecuting wrongdoers until after last year's April 5 state election in Hesse, where Degussa and Nukem are based. Nukem waited until April 8 before filing charges.    Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats won the April 5 ballot by a slim margin over the incumbent coalition of Social Democrats and the environmentalist Green party. The Social Democrats and the anti-nuclear Greens are accusing Degussa and Nukem of having manipulated the voting, which might have gone against the pro-nuclear Christian Democrats if the alleged transgressions became public knowledge ahead of the ballot.    A Degussa spokesman said: &quot;There will be no personnel consequences until the case is completely cleared up.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
