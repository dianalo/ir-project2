On the basisof these experiments, an analytical model has been developed to describethe release of radioactive iodine and noble gas from defective fuel intothe primary coolant. An analytic treatment has also been used to modelthe low-temperature release of fission products from small particlesof uranium-bearing compounds (uranium contamination) deposited on in-coresurfaces. As a result of this study, a methodology is established wherebyrelease from surface uranium contamination can be distinguished fromthat resulting from fuel pin failure. Application of this work to powerreactor operation is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
