The Ex-Im Bank said its interest rates for loans supporting U.S. exports to poor developing countries will be raised to 8% during the first half of 1988 from 7.4%. The agency raised its interest rates on loans to buyers in more developed nations to 8.85% for credits with maturities of two to five years and to 9.35% for loans with maturities of more than five years.    These rates had been 8.25% and 8.75%, respectively.    For loans to borrowers in other industrial nations, minimum rates are increased to 10.15% from 9.55% for shorter-term credits and to 10.4% from 9.8% for loans with maturities of more than five years.    The bank said its new rates will be the lowest permitted under an international export-credit agreement among 22 industrial nations that are members of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.    Under the agreement, the export-credit rate floors are subject to automatic adjustment twice a year to reflect changes in the weighted average interest rates on government bond issues denominated in U.S. dollars, West German marks, British pounds, French francs and Japanese yen during the month preceding the semi-annual reviews. </TEXT></DOC>
