In the study, conducted at medical centers in Zaire, the test performed significantly worse than it has in previous studies, the biotechnology company conceded. While not considered a definitive showing, the study suggests either that the test to detect the presence of antibodies to the AIDS virus has accuracy problems or that it is somewhat error-prone in the hands of technicians in the developing countries, which could be a major market.    The blood test is one of several recently developed AIDS diagnostics that give results more quickly and are simpler to use than currently marketed tests. The test also doesn't require refrigeration or special handling -- a potential advantage for use in Third World countries.    The Zaire study found that the Cambridge BioScience test failed to detect antibodies in about 15% of patients who had them, said Gerald Buck, chairman and chief executive officer of the Worcester, Mass.-based company. Previous studies with the test showed that it failed to detect the antibodies, which indicate an immune system response to the virus that causes AIDS, in 5% or less of patients who have them, he added.    Sponsored by the Program for Appropriate Technology andamp; Health, or PATH, a nonprofit Seattle-based group that researches medical technology for less-developed countries, the study compared results among some 4,000 patients with five different new tests for diagnosing AIDS. The Cambridge BioScience test performed worse than the other tests, some of which detected antibodies to the AIDS virus in 98% or more of the patients who had them, a PATH spokesman said. As part of its agreement with the developers of the tests, PATH allowed them to withhold publication of data on their tests.    Cambridge BioScience's Mr. Buck said the company decided to withhold publication of the data on its diagnostic test pending its review of the study's validity. &quot;The results were so much in contrast with previous experience that we wanted to see the raw data&quot; on which they were based, he said. Mr. Buck added that the company received the data only a few days before the conference began, &quot;which didn't give us enough time to determine what the problem was&quot; before researchers who conducted the PATH study planned to present the data in Stockholm.    Mr. Buck said &quot;inadequate training&quot; of technicians using its test in Zaire may have caused the test's relatively poor performance. &quot;One thing we have concluded from this is that we have to make our instructions (on using the test) simpler and more detailed than the materials we provide here,&quot; he added. Still, he maintained, the procedure is very easy to use. Under the test, AIDS antibodies are present when a milky liquid becomes slightly grainy as a patient's blood is added to it.    Sarah Gordon, an analyst with Hambrecht andamp; Quist, said the Zaire study probably won't have much effect on the marketability of Cambridge BioScience's test. In any case, she added, such tests -- typically priced at $1 to $2 each -- may not sell well in many Third World countries, in which annual per capita medical expenditures are often less than $10. The total U.S. market for AIDS diagnostics is about $18 million a year, she added.    Earlier this year, Cambridge BioScience applied for Food and Drug Administration permission to market its AIDS test in the U.S. It already is being marketed in several European and African countries, including Zaire, Mr. Buck said. </TEXT></DOC>
