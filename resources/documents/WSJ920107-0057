The venture, InterMountain Canola Co., reached anagreement to supply a stable canola oil to Anheuser-Busch'sEagle Snacks Inc. unit, for use in making potato chips. Eaglealready is selling its Cape Cod brand potato chips made withthe new oil in the Pacific Northwest.</LP><TEXT>   The agreement represents the first commercial use of thenew canola oil, called Clear Valley brand, developed by thejoint venture. So far, the oil has found a market mainly inhome use in cooking and as a salad oil. But until now, canolaoil hasn't been used widely in commercial cooking becauseuntreated canola oil develops unwanted odors and flavors, andtreated canola oil becomes higher in saturated fat.   InterMountain said the seed it has developed for the newoil overcomes those problems and can be used at hightemperatures while remaining low in saturated fat.   According to InterMountain officials, canola oil, at 6%saturated fat, is the lowest in saturated fat of any oil usedin the U.S., and thus is touted as the healthiest of cookingoils. Foods high in saturated fat are tied to hardening ofthe arteries. Canola oil is a form of rapeseed oil.   The new product &quot;is a breakthrough in terms of being ableto use a canola oil 100% in a product that gets high heatapplications . . . and a real breakthrough from thestandpoint of health and nutrition,&quot; said Richard Laster,chairman and chief executive officer of DNA Plant Technology,an agricultural biotechnology concern. Mr. Laster said foodprocessors may be using some canola oil in frying and baking,but are not using it exclusively.   The Cape Cod potato chip package includes a long messagefrom the company's president proclaiming the benefits ofusing canola oil and offering to replace the product ifconsumers aren't satisfied. The package also includes a bargraph comparing the saturated-fat content of its canola oil(6%) with sunflower oil (11%), corn oil (13%) and soybean oil(15%). Eagle uses cottonseed oil for its Cape Cod chipsoutside the Pacific Northwest.   An official of Eagle Snacks, based in St. Louis, said it'sunclear how broadly the oil might be used in other products.But he said given consumer interest in lower levels ofsaturated fats, if the new oil performs well, &quot;naturally wewould consider using it in additional products.&quot;   Mr. Laster said he expects sales of the oil will be $5million to $6 million this year. He noted that InterMountainis in talks with other large food processors and said thepotential market in the processed-food industry is about 10billion pounds of oil, or about $3 billion a year.   In addition, the venture is considering selling the oil tothe consumer market for cooking and salad oil, which Mr.Laster said represents a wholesale market of eight billionpounds a year, or about $2 billion.   &quot;There is a real potential for this oil to move into theconsumer area,&quot; said Jeff Jury, director of marketing forInterMountain Canola and a marketing manager at Du Pont. &quot;Weare looking at the consumer market in terms of how best toapproach it, since we don't have access to it,&quot; Mr. Jurysaid. Procter andamp; Gamble Co. markets a canola cooking oil toconsumers.   Mr. Jury said the venture is targeting the processed-foodand restaurant markets, which he said represent about 90% byweight of all oil used.   InterMountain also is developing and testing othervarieties of canola that it said are even lower in saturatedfat and higher in mono-unsaturated fatty acids, whichresearch suggests may improve cholesterol levels.   The company develops and grows improved seed varieties,contracts for the processing of the harvested seed andmarkets the oil to food processors. In 1991, InterMountaincontracted for about 26,000 acres in the Pacific Northwest togrow commercial quantities of canola varieties.</TEXT></DOC>
