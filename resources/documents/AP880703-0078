In a high-pressure system, also known as an anticyclone, dry airgradually descends toward the ground and moves in a clockwisepattern around the center.   It is the opposite of a cyclone, where rising, moist,counterclockwise winds promote the development of clouds, and thusrain.</TEXT><DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three years after 39 Americanswere held captive in a hijacked TWA jetliner, a Shiite Moslemcharged in the crime will face testimony from former hostages whosay time has not diminished their pain and rage.

The record backs up that statement.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Think of recent Democratic NationalConventions. Sweet harmony doesn't exactly spring to mind.   More like bitter divisions that spilled over into street battlesin Chicago 20 years ago. Or the last-ditch floor fight that Sen.Edward M. Kennedy waged against President Carter in 1980. Or anasty little firefight over selection of a new party chairman fouryears ago that weakened Walter F. Mondale almost on the eve of hisnomination.

The semantic distinction _ in which Bush attacks liberals orDemocrats but not Dukakis by name _ has allowed the vice presidentto take several trips on the Republican Party tab at a time whenhis own campaign funds are virtually gone.</TEXT><DATELINE>CLEARWATER, Fla.

Those digits have become synonymous with high technology, urbansophistication and progressive politics, town officials say, whilethe new 508 area code is strictly for hicks.   On July 16, approximately 190 communities in central and easternMassachusetts are slated to switch from 617 into 508. New EnglandTelephone Co. says that the new area code is unavoidable.</TEXT></DOC>
