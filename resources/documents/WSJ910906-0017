Peter Da Puzzo, a rising star at Shearson who was co-headof world-wide trading, sales and research, was suspended withpay along with a senior stock trader, Manny Geronimos. Mr. DaPuzzo, 50 years old and a senior executive vice president, isone of Shearson's best-known executives because he isfrequently quoted in the press about the stock market.</LP><TEXT>   Shearson said the only party hurt by the alleged stockmanipulation was ConAgra itself, which wound up raising lessmoney than it would have otherwise. A Shearson official saidthat $550,000 was &quot;refunded&quot; to ConAgra in January and thatthe company remains a Shearson client.   Although the case isn't related to Salomon Inc.'sTreasury-auction scandal, Shearson clearly wanted to avoidgetting mired in a similar debacle. Shearson determined justlast month that there were serious allegations against itsemployees; it then hired the New York-based law firm ofCadwalader, Wickersham andamp; Taft, stepped up its internalinvestigation andon the law firm's advice -- suspended thetwo executives even though no wrongdoing has been proven.Shearson also has ordered a review of all its tradingoperations.   The case under scrutiny is an offering of ConAgra stockmade last November. According to Shearson employees, thesecurities firm is investigating whether its trading deskinstigated an improper trade on the Pacific Stock Exchange,effectively changing the stock's closing price -- and thusthe price of the ConAgra stock offering -- to Shearson'sbenefit. The offering was being led by the firm's LehmanBrothers investment-banking and trading division.   Mr. Da Puzzo, in a statement, said he has been cooperatingwith Shearson and also with the New York Stock Exchange,which has been probing the suspicious ConAgra trade on thePacific exchange since last December. &quot;I look forward to anearly resolution of this matter, and I am confident that theinternal and exchange inquiries will confirm that I actedproperly at all times,&quot; the statement said.   As for Mr. Geronimos, he &quot;is cooperating fully with bothhis firm and the exchange in connection with theinvestigations,&quot; said Anne Flannery, his attorney at MorganLewis andamp; Bockius in New York. &quot;He is being completely candidwith them and looks forward to this being resolved,&quot; shesaid.   The questionable trade consisted of 100 ConAgra shares.They were sold &quot;short&quot; -- borrowed and sold -- on the Pacificexchange just after the closing bell in New York, at a price12.5 cents below ConAgra's Big Board close that day. (As ithappens, the trade never became official, because it violatedstock market rules against short-selling at a lower pricethan the previous trade. Shearson says it then refunded themoney ConAgra had foregone as a result of this oddball tradeeven though it didn't yet suspect that its own traders mightbe to blame.)   Why would a Shearson trader want the price to drop? Theprice of the 4.4 million-share ConAgra offering was to be theday's closing price. To the surprise and chagrin of Shearsontraders who had spent all day lining up buyers at thethen-prevailing price of $33.25 a share, the stock's pricerose 12.5 cents just before the Big Board's closing bell. Butbecause of the trade on the Pacific exchange, Shearson wasable to sell the stock at the $33.25-a-share buyers wereexpecting to pay.   The Pacific-exchange trade immediately raised eyebrows inthe stock market, and the Big Board began its investigationlast December with Shearson's cooperation. The Big Board hasrules against &quot;pegging&quot; or artificially affecting a stockprice before a public offering.   Initially, Shearson traders denied having anything to dowith the trade. But last month, Shearson officials said, alower-level employee disclosed that she got instructions toquietly place the trade with a floor trader at the Pacificexchange. The Cadwalader law firm was brought in at thatpoint, leading to yesterday's suspensions.   Shearson said the alleged activities were unrelated to theTreasury auction scandal at Salomon. However, a Shearsonexecutive said the firm has recently widened itsinvestigation &quot;given the climate for these kinds of things.&quot;   The disclosures could set back Shearson's recent effortsto recuperate from more than a year of financial andmanagement turmoil. A year ago, the big brokerage firm almostcollapsed. But since then, its parent, American Express Co.,has replaced top management and vowed that Shearson would berun as tightly as any firm on Wall Street.   In a letter to employees, Howard L. Clark Jr., Shearson'schairman, said the two executives were suspended &quot;becauseserious allegations have been made that call into questionthe conduct of these employees. It will also allow theseindividuals the opportunity to devote their energies . . . toresolving the matter.&quot; Because of the ConAgra case, Shearsonand its lawyers have gone back and reviewed all of Shearson'spublic stock offerings since January 1990. Shearson saidnothing else suspicious has turned up.   Mr. Clark, keenly aware of the attention that the Salomonscandal has received around the world, told the employees:&quot;We will not tolerate any conduct that violates either theletter or the spirit of laws and regulations that govern theconduct of our business. Where questions of integrity areconcerned, we will act quickly and decisively to ensure thatwe continually meet the highest ethical standards in allaspects of our business.&quot;   In Omaha, Neb., a ConAgra spokesman declined to comment.The Big Board wouldn't comment except to say that Shearson iscooperating.   Shearson was the sole underwriter of the ConAgra offeringof 4.4 million shares, issued primarily to finance theacquisition of brewing materials, wool and meat assets ofElders IXL Ltd., Australia, which later changed its name toFoster's Brewing Group Ltd. ConAgra completed thatacquisition in May for $125 million.</TEXT></DOC>
