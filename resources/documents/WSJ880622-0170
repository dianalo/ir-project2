Complex rules are designed to keep U.S. corporations from taking tax-free advantage of foreign earnings. Example: A loan for over a year from a controlled foreign corporation to its parent is deemed a taxable dividend. Up to now, short-term loans have escaped this treatment. But last week, an obscure provision in temporary and proposed IRS rules on foreign units revoked the exception. &quot;This is terribly important to a lot of companies,&quot; says Steven Hannes of Touche Ross andamp; Co., CPAs.    The rule change is meant to stop companies from using successive short-term loans to repatriate foreign earnings tax-free for the long term. In practice, the tax effects vary. A foreign unit's dividend payment is likely to incur foreign tax -- and to create more foreign credits against U.S. tax than the U.S. parent can use. A loan won't incur foreign tax, but it may trigger U.S. tax without bringing back cash permanently.    It's an effort to curtail well-established planning techniques for cash flow and credits, Hannes says.    TAXPAYERS HAVE RIGHTS? You bet. A new IRS brochure spells them out.    &quot;You have the right to plan your business and personal finances in such a way that you will pay the least tax that is due under the law,&quot; says four-page Publication 1, which the IRS is getting ready to issue. It's partly in answer to a pending &quot;taxpayers' bill of rights&quot;-legislation the IRS thinks is mostly unnecessary. But it agrees that taxpayers often don't know their rights and need clear statements of them.    The brochure describes rights to privacy and confidentiality, courtesy and consideration, and special aid for problems that aren't solved through normal channels. It tells about free help. Being audited &quot;does not suggest that you are dishonest.&quot; The brochure explains appeals, abatements of penalties, and collections. &quot;Our goal . . . is to make sure that your rights are protected, so that you will have the highest confidence in . . . our tax system,&quot; it says.    TAKEOVER TARGETS face tougher criteria for spinning off assets tax-free.    One defense against a hostile takeover involves giving shareholders the stock of a subsidiary with major assets. A target must get the IRS to rule that such a spinoff is tax-free. That requires a valid business purpose; thwarting a raider is one. Formerly, an investment banker's letter finding vulnerability sufficed to show a takeover threat. But, Thomas Kane of the IRS told tax lawyers in May, the business-purpose requirement has been stiffened.    Needed now: A banker's opinion that the spinoff will protect the company, plus the SEC Schedule 13D filing by a raider with a proven track record who owns 5% of the stock. New ruling 8819075, for an anonymous company, exemplifies this, says Robert Willens of Shearson Lehman Hutton. A group led by a person with a takeover history filed 13Ds; the company's banker said a takeover bid might be imminent and that a spinoff would lessen vulnerability.    &quot;It appears that an unknown hostile suitor might not prompt a favorable ruling,&quot; Willens adds.    FIRED because her employer thought she had incited an inquiry into sex-based wage disparities, Christine A. Byrne of New Jersey won $20,000 in settlement of a suit filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The IRS sought to tax it all. But the Tax Court says half is tax-free damages for personal injuries.    A BREAKING-UP BOON for one spouse who buys the other's interest in their home as part of a divorce or legal separation: IRS Notice 88-74 says that interest on debt incurred for the purchase is deductible under new law covering mortgage interest.    TAX-COURT SECURITY is tightened. At a trial last month in Seattle, a man who had been told his claims were frivolous shot himself to death. &quot;We are going to make sure that such an incident doesn't happen again,&quot; says Chief Judge Nims.    LIFE-INSURANCE CONCERNS stray far from 1984-tax-act goals, a study shows.    And that may well spur new Congressional tinkering with industry taxes. Government tax-revenue estimaters tried with the 1984 act to set the level and division of industry taxes. Mutual companies, owned by policyholders, were to pay 55% of the taxes; stock companies, owned by shareholders, would pay 45%. Now a long-awaited Treasury study says 1984 and 1985 tax revenues were way off the mark for reasons unforeseen by estimaters.    The industry paid $5.3 billion over two years, well under the $6.2 billion forecast. In 1985, for example, mutual companies paid $1.3 billion instead of $1.7 billion; stock concerns paid $1.6 billion instead of $1.4 billion. Estimaters misjudged the effects of tax-law changes and new products on such things as dividend payments and the use of net-operating-loss carry-forwards -- both of which rose. A final Treasury report due Jan. 1 is to evaluate the success of current law and discuss possible changes.    The Treasury favors trying to project taxable income accurately instead of setting tax-revenue goals.    BRIEFS: Penalties that a truck-engine maker paid to the Environmental Protection Agency for failing emission tests aren't fines and are deductible as business costs, says IRS Revenue Ruling 88-46 . . . A transitional tax break for gasohol producers will continue through Dec. 31, the IRS says; their reduced tax rate on gasoline purchases was to expire June 30. </TEXT></DOC>
