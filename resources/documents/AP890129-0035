The allegations of corruption, fraud and waste in federal Indianprograms were aired initially in a series of articles by The ArizonaRepublic.   All evidence of criminal wrongdoing will be handed over to theJustice Department, said Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., head of thespecial committee formed in October 1987 following the newspaperarticles.   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also areon the committee.   DeConcini and McCain told the Republic's Washington bureau theinitial two weeks of hearings will bring to a close the inquiry'sfirst phase.   After initial testimony on the U.S. government treaty'sobligations to Indians, the first week of hearings will be dominatedby examples of abuses and fraud in federal programs designed toencourage the government to contract with Indian-owned firms forconstruction projects on reservations and for providing supplies toIndians, DeConcini said.   Owners of companies have offered bribes of cars, trips and moneyto Indian leaders and Small Business Administration officials to wincontracts, DeConcini said.   DeConcini declined to provide specifics, saying they would bedisclosed during the hearings.   A second round of hearings, slated to begin this spring, willinvestigate fraud in Indian-resource programs.   Senate investigators have found that large companies bilkedtaxpayers and Indians of undisclosed amounts by outright theft ofresources and by underpaying royalties for oil, gas, minerals andtimber from Indian lands, DeConcini said.   But he said investigators have not yet uncovered what TheRepublic's series reported was billions of dollars in theft ofresources or underreporting of production volumes, done to lowerroyalty payments.   DeConcini said the ongoing resources inquiry has been slowed byshoddy record keeping by the Interior Department, of which theBureau of Indian Affairs is a part.   He said record keeping is so lax investigators have been forcedto piece together contracts and production levels by cross-checkingthem with documents at resource companies and associations.   DeConcini and McCain stressed that corruption is not the centralfocus of the investigation.   ``We want to highlight the problems for American people, whodon't know or don't care, about a significant portion of thepopulation which lives under vastly different conditions than themajority of other Americans,'' McCain said.   McCain, discussing allegations of child abuse at Indian schools,said Senate investigators will show that federal officialsrepeatedly fail to make even cursory background checks ofprospective teachers. The Senate inquiry also found that indianaffairs officials have resisted investigating charges of abuse, hesaid.   DeConcini said investigators also have solid evidence thatorganized crime figures have infiltrated Indian gaming operations,using coercion and ``a heavy hand.''   ``The bingo area has been a real invitation to organized crime,''DeConcini said, adding that the hearings will look into ``theinability or unwillingness of tribal leaders to resist'' andinadequate laws and enforcement.   Officials said the Senate inquiry has taken investigators to 30states. More than 900,000 pages of documents have been reviewed andmore than 600 people interviewed.   The panel has subpoenaed more than 270 people and, afterconsulting with the Justice Department, granted immunity to anundisclosed number, including Indian aides and contracting companyowners, The Republic said.</TEXT></DOC>
