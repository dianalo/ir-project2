The air flow pattern in the return airway model illustratedthe conditions in that specific underground very well and ensures translatabilityof the findings obtained from model experiments. Using the measurementsit was also demonstrated that the measuring point in the return airwaywas appropriately located to allow an evaluation of the work sites inthat area.</TEXT></DOC>
