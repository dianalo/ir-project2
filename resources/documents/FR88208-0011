Background</ITAG>When an individual in an institution is determined to be eligible for Medicaid,his or her income, except for a small amount for personal needs, must beused to partially pay for the cost of institutional care. The Medicaidprogram pays the remaining amount at the Medicaid reimbursement rate. Existingregulations require that States deduct from a recipient's income billsfor medical expenses that are not covered in the State Medicaid plan. Statesmay, however, place reasonable limits on these deductions. The existingregulations were published under the authority of section 1902(a)(17) ofthe Social Security Act (the Act), which gives the Secretary broad authorityto set standards for the reasonable treatment of an individual's income.States have complained that the existing regulations require them to deductthe cost of medical services that States have decided not to cover in theirMedicaid plans. Some of these noncovered medical deductions are consideredby States to be nonessential medical services, or services that duplicatecovered services. The result is that less of an individual's income isavailable to contribute to the cost of institutional care, and the Statepays more for care. In addition, States have reported that it is difficultfor them to make monthly payment adjustments to an institution when a recipient'sincome is reduced by irregular medical deductions. States suggested thatit would be easier for them to pay institutions if they are allowed theflexibility to estimate and project monthly recipient income and medicaldeductions, based on their experience in a preceding period.On March 19, 1985, we published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, at 50 FR 10992, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(NPRM) to solicit comments on proposed changes to the regulations thatspecify how much of an institutionalized individual's income must be appliedto the cost of care in the facility.In an effort to reduce administrative problems for States, we proposedin the NPRM to permit States the flexibility to use either actual monthlyincome received or to project anticipated income using the average amountof monthly income received by an individual over the preceding 6 monthperiod. Second, we proposed that a State may deduct from an individual'sincome none, some or all of the cost of medical expenses that are not coveredunder the State's Medicaid plan, subject to reasonable limits. Further,we proposed that a State must deduct from an individual's income any medicalexpenses that are covered in the State's plan, even though they exceedlimits set by the State on amount, duration or scope, subject to reasonablelimits set by a State. Third, although not included as a proposed rulechange, we solicited comments on the feasibility of permitting States theadditional option of projecting deductions of an individual's medical expenses,based on an average of those expenses in previous months. On this lastproposal our intent was to permit such an option if we received sufficientpublic support for the proposal.These regulations do not reflect the provisions of Pub. L. 99-643, whichbecame effective on July 1, 1987. This law amends section 1611(e)(1) ofthe Act, to provide an additional 2 months Supplemental Security Income(SSI) payment for certain institutionalized individuals. The additional2 months of SSI payment is intended for the individual's use in meetingexpenses outside the institution. Pub. L. 99-643 also amends section 1902of the Act to provide that this income must be disregarded under the Medicaidprogram when determining the individual's required contribution to thecost of care in a medical institution. We are developing instructions andrevisions to the regulations to implement the provisions of Pub. L. 99-643.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Response to Public Comments </ITAG>In response to our request for public comments on the March 19, 1985 publication,we received 37 letters, of which 24 were from State Medicaid agencies.A. Permit States to Project Anticipated Income Based on the Average MonthlyIncome Received in the Previous 6 Month Period We proposed that, in determining an individual's monthly income to be appliedto the cost of care, each State may continue to use monthly income receivedor it may project anticipated income using the average amount of monthlyincome received by an individual over the preceding 6 month period. Ifa State chooses to project income, we proposed that the State must periodicallyreconcile actual income with estimated income. 1. <T3>Comment:</T3> Three commenters questioned whether the proposal appliesnot only to income that is irregularly received or that fluctuates in amount,but also to income that is regularly received in fixed amounts, such asSocial Security benefits. One commenter suggested using different methodsof projection for various types of income. For example: andbullet; For income that is received seasonally or yearly, a State wouldbase the projection on the corresponding period of the year. andbullet; For regularly received income, a State would base the projectionon the current amount of income. andbullet; For income that is irregularly received or that fluctuates inamount, a State would base the projection on the average amount receivedin the preceding 6 month period. <T3>Response:</T3> Our intent was that the provision to project incomeapply to all types of income mentioned by the commenters. As the commenterspointed out, a State may be able to anticipate income that is receivedby an individual seasonally or yearly, and want to include that incomein the projection. We believe that this is reasonable, and compatible withthe intent of the projection method. Therefore, we are clarifying in thefinal regulations, andSection;andSection; 435.725(e)(2), 435.733(e)(2), 435.832(e)(2),and 436.832(e)(2), that the agency's estimate of income must include anticipatedincome. 2. <T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters had difficulty understanding the varietyof terms we used with regard to income. They asked that we define the terms``income,'' ``total income,'' ``actual income,'' and ``available income.''<T3>Response:</T3> In the proposed rule, we used ``total income'' to meangross income from all sources, before any deductions are taken. The otherterms listed were synonymous with total income. We distinguish total incomefrom ``countable income,'' which is used in Medicaid eligibility determinationsto mean income remaining after certain deductions are taken. We agree thatthe terms used in the proposed rule were confusing, and as a result, inthe final regulations we are consistently using the term ``total income.''3. <T3>Comment:</T3> Three commenters recommended that we disregard infrequentlyreceived income when it is less than $20.00 per month, and small amountsof income (less than $10.00) from interest and dividends because they aredifficult for States to verify. Another commenter suggested that Statesbe permitted to allow small amounts of income from interest or dividends,for example, that are received infrequently to accrue as a resource, andthen adjust monthly income periodically to reflect amounts exceeding allowableresource limits. <T3>Response:</T3> We do not consider interest and dividends to be resources.We define them as income when received. Therefore, interest and dividendsmust be taken into account in the eligibility process. The post-eligibilityprocess is based on a consideration of all income considered in the eligibilityprocess. Since interest and dividends are taken into account in the eligibilitystep, we do not believe it is reasonable to make an exception for thistype of income in the post-eligibility step. Once the State knows the amountof interest and dividends for the eligibility step, that income, no matterhow small, can be calculated into the projection of total income. 4. <T3>Comment:</T3> Five commenters were concerned that the projections ofincome should be based not only on past experience, but also on reliableinformation concerning future changes. <T3>Response:</T3> We agree, and are revising the regulations to requirethat States consider significant changes in income as they occur, and takefuture or past changes in circumstances into consideration when projectingincome. This provision is contained in revised paragraph (e)(3) of andSection;andSection;435.725, 435.733, 435.832, and 436.832. While we are requiring that Statesmake adjustments as soon as significant changes in circumstances are known,in the interest of State flexibility, we leave it to each State to define``significant change.'' 5. <T3>Comment:</T3> Commenters had many concerns about the requirement thatStates periodically reconcile the income projection with income actuallyreceived. Four commenters saw reconciliation as duplicative of the regularbudgeting process, and unnecessarily burdensome. One commenter complainedthat requiring periodic reconciliation reduces the flexibility States hadwanted. <T3>Response:</T3> We believe that it is essential that States reconciledifferences between projected and actual income to assure that the recipient'sactual liability, rather than an estimate, is determined. The projectionmethod was intended to reduce budgeting problems for States when incomeis irregularly received or fluctuates in amount. It was not meant to takethe place of actual income in determining a recipient's contribution tothe cost of care and the amount of the State's payment. 6. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter recommended that we use a retrospectivebudgeting procedure instead of reconciliation. <T3>Response:</T3> Retrospective budgeting methods do not use current incomeas the basis for projection, but income previously received. In the retrospectivebudgeting used in some State cash assistance programs, future income isestimated solely on the basis of the income that was actually receivedin a prior period. There is no consideration of anticipated changes inincome. For income such as pension checks, that are usually constant inamount, the result under both methods will be the same. When income isirregularly received or differs in amount from time to time, retrospectivebudgeting may understate or overstate recipient liability, with no mechanismfor adjustment. Therefore, we believe that the use of retrospective budgetingis not appropriate in the post eligibility period, and is not sufficientto protect the interests of recipients and States. 7. <T3>Comment:</T3> Three commenters were concerned that when projectionsof income are lower than actual income received, at the time of readjustmenta recipient may suddenly owe the facility a large amount of money, andmay have already spent that money for other things. They asked if thisincreased liability could be applied in future determinations. One commenter suggested that we require that States notify a recipientat the beginning of a 6 month period that the recipient's liability isbased on an estimate of income to be received in future months, and thatadjustments will be required if the estimated income is different fromactual income received. <T3>Response:</T3> If a projection is too low, the additional funds receivedby a recipients would be adjusted in the month of reconciliation. As discussedin the response to comment A.4 States must make an immediate adjustmentwhen there is any significant change in income. We believe that this willreduce adjustments at reconciliation to a minimal level. Moreover, thissituation should occur infrequently when States work with recipients and,when appropriate, their representatives. We do not agree with the suggestion that States should be required to notifyrecipients at the beginning of a period that their liability for futuremonths is based on an estimate. Existing regulations at 42 CFR 431.206and 431.210 require that an agency notify an applicant or recipient ofany action affecting his or her claim for Medicaid benefits, and explainthe reasons for the action. We believe that it is reasonable to requirethat agencies notify a recipient only when reconciliation results in anadjustment in the recipient's liability. Agencies may, however, provideadvance notice to recipients in addition to the required notice. 8. <T3>Comment:</T3> Some commenters were concerned about the frequency ofreconciliations between projected and actual income. One commenter thoughtthat the requirement that States ``periodically'' reconcile projected incomewith actual income was too general, and suggested that the term, ``periodically,''be replaced by ``at the close of each 6 month period.'' Two commentersrecommended that reconciliation be required when a recipient dies or leavesthe facility, rather than at a predetermined date. <T3>Response:</T3> We agree with the comment that the term, ``periodically''is vague. In response to the comment, we are revising paragraph (e)(3)of andSection;andSection; 435.725, 435.733, 435.832, and 436.832 of the regulationsto specify that States must reconcile estimated income with income receivedand adjust estimates at the end of a prospective period not to exceed 6months. In regard to the second suggestion, that States should reconcile incomewhen a recipient dies or leaves an institution, we believe the changesdiscussed in the response to comment A.4 would apply. That is, paragraph(e)(3) of andSection;andSection; 435.725, 435.733, 435.832, and 436.832 ofthe regulations now requires that States adjust their calculations whena recipient's income or circumstances change significantly. 9. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter noted that the proposal seemed to permitStates to continue averaging of income. <T3>Response:</T3> Contrary to the commenter's belief, we have never permittedaveraging of income when computing recipient cost of care liability inan institution. As we understand the term, income averaging means thatincome received over a number of months is totaled and then divided bythe number of months to obtain an average. This average income is thenapplied to the cost of care without any readjustment for actual amountsreceived. The final rule provides that projected income must be reconciledat least once every 6 months. 10. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that we include guidelines inthe final rule to assist States in making reasonable income projections.<T3>Response:</T3> We will issue guidelines to States in the form of instructions.We believe that detailed guidelines are more appropriately placed in instructionsthan in the final regulations.B. Permit States to Deduct None, Some or all of Medical Expenses not Coveredin the State Medicaid Plan, Subject to Reasonable LimitsWe proposed that a State may deduct from an individual's income none, someor all of the cost of medical expenses that are recognized under Statelaw, but not covered in the State's Medicaid plan, subject to reasonablelimits set by a State. Further, we proposed that a State must deduct anymedical expenses that are included in the State's plan, but limited bythe State in amount, duration or scope, subject to reasonable limits setby the State.On the basis of numerous comments against the proposal to require Statesto deduct from an individual's income medical expenses that are coveredin the State plan, but beyond amount, duration and scope limits, we arerevising our position on this issue. Several States said that our proposalrequires them to subsidize indirectly services for which they have chosennot to pay. They believe that it also increases Medicaid program costsbecause recipient income that is used for noncovered medical expenses isnot applied to the cost of institutional care. The result is higher paymentsby the State Medicaid program to a facility to compensate for smaller amountsof income from recipients. Some commenters also stated their belief thatthis provision is contrary to their authority under the Act to establishlimits on amount, duration and scope of services covered in their Stateplan. Other commenters objected to it because they believe that it willbe burdensome and difficult to implement, or have inequitable results,and gave illustrations.After careful consideration of the numerous comments on this issue, wehave come to the conclusion that requiring States to deduct medical expensesfor services included in the State plan, but which exceed State plan limits,would be inconsistent with our intent to provide States with greater flexibility.Moreover, the comments convince us that these services fall into the samecategory as services not covered under the plan, in that no payment ismade for them. We believe that it is reasonable to treat these servicesin the same way as services not covered under the State plan. Consequently,we are not requiring that States deduct these services, but are makingthese deductions optional. In andSection;andSection; 435.725(d)(1), 435.733(d)(1),435.832(d)(1), and 436.832(d)(1) of this final rule, we provide that aState may deduct any medical expenses included in the State's plan, whichexceed that State's limits on amount, duration or scope of services forthe group under which the individual is eligible, subject to reasonablelimits set by the State. In andSection;andSection; 435.725(d)(2), 435.733(d)(2),435.832(d)(2), and 436.832(d)(2), we provide that a State may deduct medicalexpenses recognized under State law, but not included in the State's Medicaidplan.Other specific comments follow.1. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter requested clarification on how the provisionto deduct none, some, or all expenses not covered in the State plan wouldbe implemented for State plan covered services requiring prior approval,and for covered services furnished by non-enrolled providers. The commenteralso suggested that we revise the regulations to specify that a recipientmay not deduct an institution's daily rate.<T3>Response:</T3> We regard any service included in the State plan thatis subject to prior approval, and which has been disapproved or for whichthe request has not been acted upon by the State in a timely manner, asa service that exceeds amount, duration and scope limits. Under these finalregulations, States may deduct none, some or all of the expenses for theseservices from the individual's income, subject to reasonable limits setby the State. A service included in the State plan that is furnished bya nonenrolled provider may be deducted from a recipient's income. Statesmay also choose to deduct none, some or all of an individual's expensesfor services not covered under the State plan.Since the daily or per diem rate paid by the Medicaid program to a facilitythat is enrolled in the program is an expense covered under the State plan,it is not an expense that is deducted from an institutionalized person'sincome that is applied to the cost of care.2. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that we require that States providerecipients with a ``notice of noncovered allowance''. The allowance shouldbe made only when the recipient requests it and when he or she providesverification of medical expenses.<T3>Response:</T3> States may take this approach if they choose, but weare not making it a requirement for all States. We think it most appropriatefor States to decide how to implement these provisions.3. <T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters suggested that we revise the regulationsto place limits on medical deductions for expenses incurred during a periodof ineligibility. One of these commenters argued that deductions shouldbe permitted only for services furnished within a budget period. Otherwise,a State is subsidizing medical expenses for a period during which an individualwas ineligible. The second commenter asked if States may limit the amountof deductions for institutional expenses during periods of ineligibilityto no more than the Medicaid reimbursement rate. A third commenter askedfor specific examples of limits or parameters in guidelines.<T3>Response:</T3> Services furnished to an individual during a periodof ineligibility are services not covered under the State plan. Therefore,the State is not required to deduct medical expenses for services furnishedduring a period of ineligibility, and may limit deductions to serviceswithin the budget period. If the State chooses to allow deductions formedical expenses furnished during a period of ineligibility, it may placereasonable limits on these deductions. This includes institutional expensesincurred during a period of ineligibility and expenses for other coveredservices. States have the option to deduct institutional expenses at theprivate rate or at the Medicaid reimbursement rate, subject to reasonablelimits imposed by the State.We will provide guidance to any State requesting it, and will considerissuing State Medicaid Manual guidelines that contain examples.4. <T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters suggested that the regulations includea definition of ``reasonable limits.'' One of the commenters was concernedthat a State may establish limits that underestimate actual medical costs,resulting in the disadvantage of recipients. The commenter suggested thatwe define ``reasonable'' to mean ``reasonably reflecting actual costs incurred.''The commenter suggested that States should also be required to describehow they determine that an expense is reasonable.<T3>Response:</T3> A fixed definition of the term, ``reasonable limits,''would limit the flexibility we intended. Therefore, we are not definingit in these final regulations. However, as noted in the response to comment3, we will consider issuing guidelines on this subject. Because each Statehas the discretion to decide what optional services will be covered underits Medicaid program and how much it will pay for the service, we believeit is inappropriate to define what constitutes ``reasonable limits'' inthese final regulations. States have always been required to describe anylimits they place on these expenses, subject to our review, and these regulationsdo not change this requirement.We note that in the preamble to the proposed rule, we cited aggregate limitsas an example of limits we would consider to be unreasonable. We said thatit would be unreasonable for States to set a monthly dollar (aggregate)limit on all noncovered medical expenses to be deducted by an individual,but that it would be reasonable for States to set limits on each type ofservice not covered in the plan. In reviewing the comments, we have cometo the conclusion that restricting States from imposing aggregate limitswould limit flexibility in a manner inconsistent with our intent in revisingthis policy.  5. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter was concerned that requiring States todeduct expenses for covered services exceeding State plan limits wouldincrease the quality control (QC) error rate.  <T3>Response: </T3>In these final regulations we are not requiring thatStates deduct expenses for covered services exceeding State plan limits.Quality control reviews are done in accordance with individual State planprovisions. We see no reason for increased error rates if reasonable limitsare clearly described in the State plan.  6. <T3>Comment: </T3>Five commenters believe that the provision giving Statesthe option to permit deductions only for services covered in the Stateplan will result in higher Medicaid costs. The commenters expect that significantnumbers of recipients will go without needed medical care or preventiveservices, which will lead to recipients who need more expensive servicesin the future.  <T3>Response: </T3>We do not believe that this provision will result insignificantly higher Medicaid costs. We have no evidence that the anticipatedshift in the pattern of care will occur. Each individual in an institutionis under a plan of care that must meet strict standards, and most of anindividual's medical needs are met by the institution. Further, we believethat States will be careful to assure that a recipient's medical needsare met and that a neglected condition does not result in a higher costat a later date.  7. <T3>Comment: </T3>Thirteen commenters argued against implementing the proposalbecause it will adversely affect institutional patients by denying themaccess to necessary medical care by preventing them from using their incomefor this purpose. They cite as a possible consequence that providers willrefuse services. The personal needs allowance, at a minimum of $25.00 permonth, is insufficient to cover the cost of noncovered care.  <T3>Response: </T3>We agree that when a particular service is not coveredin a State's Medicaid plan there may be no way for a recipient to obtainthat service without financial help. We believe that, because most necessarymedical services for institutionalized individuals are included in servicespaid for by Medicaid, there is no strong evidence that individuals willnot receive essential medical services that are available to a State'sMedicaid population.  8. <T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters contend that the proposal is inconsistentwith a provision of the Act which requires that States take into accountcosts for incurred medical care.  <T3>Response: </T3>While section 1902(a)(17) of the Act requires that Statestake into account some costs of incurred medical expenses, it does notrequire that all incurred expenses be considered. The Act gives the Secretarya great deal of discretion in setting standards to determine the extentof medical assistance. Moreover, the provision in section 1902(a)(17) regardingconsideration of incurred medical expenses is the basis of the spend downprocess by which eligibility is determined for the medically needy. Thestatutory basis for the post-eligibility process is found elsewhere insection 1902(a)(17) in the language that authorizes States to determinethe extent of medical assistance.  9. <T3>Comment: </T3>One provider association predicted that providers willlose Medicaid revenue under this proposal, or they will restrict servicesto institutional patients. The commenter also thought that the proposalwould jeopardize the ability of institutions to provide quality care.<T3>Response: </T3>The commenter seems to suggest that an institution willdetermine whether a recipient's income will be used for institutional careor be used for care that is beyond State plan limits. The physician, inconsultation with the recipient, usually determines the need for care notprovided in the institution, and the extent to which it needs to be provided.We do not believe that providers participating in a State's Medicaid programwill lose Medicaid revenues since these regulations do not change the waynon-institutional providers are reimbursed, and States are required toreimburse facilities the difference between patient contributions to careand the Medicaid reimbursement rate.10. <T3>Comment: </T3>One client advocacy group contends that the provisiondiscriminates against individuals in States with very limited Medicaidprograms. Another commenter argued that this proposal creates an incentivefor States to restrict their Medicaid coverage.<T3>Response: </T3>Section 1902(a)(10) of the Act requires that Statesprovide a basic level of medical coverage for Medicaid recipients. Statesmust provide certain basic services, but have the option to expand therange of services. We believe that this provision is consistent with thisbasic Medicaid program principle. The potential impact of permitting Statesthe option to exclude deduction of noncovered services, however, may begreater in States with very few covered services, which decide not to deductuncovered medical expenses since the recipient's income after requireddeductions would be applied to the cost of institutional care.There are many criteria upon which a State bases its coverage and limitationsof coverage. We believe that it is unlikely that a State will substantiallyalter the extent of covered services in response to this provision.11. <T3>Comment: </T3>One client advocacy group believes that the proposalwould require an individual to use his or her personal needs allowancefor noncovered care. The commenter reported that in the Tax Equity andFiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-248), Congress declared thatnursing home residents are not required to use their personal needs allowancesfor copayments for Medicaid services.<T3>Response: </T3>We did not propose that nursing home residents use theirpersonal needs allowances for medical services. We are defining how incomeremaining after deduction of the personal needs allowance and other specificdeductions is used for medical services not paid for by a State.12. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter noted that since the proposed regulationsdo not use the phrase, ``recognized under State law,'' this would permitStates to treat medical services in different ways, depending on whetherthe service is covered in the State Medical plan.<T3>Response: </T3>The phrase, ``recognized under State law,'' remainsin andSection; 435.725(d)(2), 435.733(d)(2), 435.832(d)(2), and 436.832(d)(2),and is used only in reference to services that are not covered in a State'sMedicaid plan. We omitted that reference in regard to covered servicesbecause it is unlikely that a service would be covered in a State planand not be recognized under State law.13. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter believes that we need to encourage Statesto more carefully evaluate whether a noncovered medical service is medicallynecessary and whether the cost is reasonable. Also, the commenter suggestedthat we place greater emphasis on preventing unscrupulous providers fromtaking unfair advantage of institutionalized recipients by furnishing unnecessaryor duplicative services.<T3>Response: </T3>We agree with the commenter that institutionalized recipientsmay be coerced into obtaining unneeded or expensive services. We are continuingto encourage States to work with the provider community to ensure thatthis problem is minimized.C. Permit States to Project Medical Deductions for Services not Paid forby a State, Based on an Average of Expenses in Previous MonthsAlthough not included as a proposed rule change, we indicated in the preambleto the March 19, 1985 proposal that we were particularly interested inreviewing public comments on whether States should have the additionaloption to project deductions of an individual's medical expenses basedon an average of expenses in previous months. This proposed option wasintended to eliminate the need for States to do monthly budgeting.1. <T3>Comment: </T3>Nineteen commenters support the idea of permitting Statesto project medical expenses. Six commenters added that without permittingprojection of medical expenses, projection of income alone would not makemonthly budgeting any easier for States. One commenter pointed out that,because existing regulations at 42 CFR 435.725, 435.733, 435.832 and 436.832do not require that deductions for noncovered medical expenses be madeon a monthly basis, we could interpret the existing regulations to permitprojection of medical expenses.<T3>Response: </T3>The overwhelming number of commenters favored permittingStates to project medical expenses. While we agree that the existing regulationscan be interpreted to permit projection of medical expenses, we believeit best to explicitly provide for projection of medical expenses in theregulations and to clarify the policy. In response to the comments, weare revising the regulations to permit States to project anticipated medicalexpenses for a period not to exceed 6 months. This estimate is to be basedon the average monthly medical expenses incurred by a recipient duringthe preceding 6 month period. As with income projection, we will requirethat States consider future changes in a recipient's expenses when makingthe projection, and to reassess the projection if unpredicted changes occurwithin the 6 month period. To ensure that the projection estimate is inline with actual deductions, we will require that States reconcile estimatedexpenses with actual expenses at the end of each 6 month period.2. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters asked how quality control reviews willbe performed when medical expenses are projected.<T3>Response: </T3>Quality control reviews will determine whether a Statepaid the correct amount to an institution based on actual recipient incomereceived and medical expenses deducted. If a State chooses to estimateand project income and medical expenses, QC will determine whether a Statecorrectly followed requirements in the regulations and procedures specifiedin the State's Medicaid plan. The QC reviewers will determine if the estimatesof income and medical expenses are correct in view of previously receivedincome and incurred medical expenses, whether significant changes wereconsidered timely, and whether a reconciliation was properly done.3. <T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters had different views on what time period shouldbe used as a basis for projections of medical expense deductions and whatprospective period should be used. Two commenters recommended basing theprojection on the previous 6 month period, while one commenter suggestedusing a shorter period of no more than 3 months. Three commenters believea prospective period of 6 months should be used to be consistent with projectionof income.<T3>Response: </T3>We agree with the majority of the commenters that a6 month prospective period is the longest period that should be used inthe interest of avoiding errors and making adjustments easier. This periodis also consistent with the period used for projection of income. We arerevising the regulations (paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of andSection;andSection;435.725, 435.733, 435.832 and 436.832) to provide that States may projectmedical expense deductions for a prospective period not to exceed 6 months.States may base the projection on a preceding period, not to exceed 6 months.4. <T3>Comment: </T3>Seven commenters agreed that, as with income projections,some kind of adjustment will be needed to reconcile estimated medical deductionswith actual deductions. A variety of recommendations were made on how weshould modify the regulations to ensure prompt and accurate adjustments.One commenter suggested that we permit States to set aggregate allowancesfor medical deductions with a reconciliation at the end of 6 months. Anothercommenter recommended a flexible system allowing States to recalculateexpenses whenever significant changes occur. A third commenter advocatedrequiring that if actual costs exceed average projected costs by more than$50, a State must recalculate the projection.<T3>Response: </T3>In considering the comments, we believe that two issuesare important: (1) Flexibility for States to devise their own procedures,and (2) consistency with the policy on projection of income so that expensesand income are considered together. Consequently, we are revising the regulations(paragraph (f) of andSection;andSection; 435.725, 435.733, 435.832, and 436.832)to parallel the provisions on income projection, to require that adjustmentsto estimates of monthly medical deductions must be made at the end of theprospective period, not to exceed 6 months, or when any significant changeoccurs. In the interest of flexibility, States are free to define ``significantchange.'' We believe that if States readjust calculations when medicalexpenses change significantly, then a recipient's monthly liability canbe adjusted accordingly. To further increase flexibility, as we noted inthe response to comment B.4, we are permitting States to set aggregatelimits on monthly medical deductions.D. General Comments Relating to All the Proposals1. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters suggested that we revise the regulationsgoverning the quality control system and Federal financial participation(FFP) disallowances based on error rates. The commenters contend that thequality control system is unfair because FFP disallowances are taken onlyon errors that result in overpayment by the Medicaid program. Underpaymentshould also be penalized. The commenters are concerned that estimatingand projecting income and medical deductions under these regulations mayresult in a recipient paying too much income to a facility, and the Medicaidprogram making too small a payment.<T3>Response: </T3>If procedures on reconciliation of income and expensesare correctly followed by States, we anticipate few errors. We think thatit is unlikely that States would deliberately underpay when they have theflexibility to design a system which promotes both accuracy and ease ofadministration in the post eligibility process.2. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that these provisions be exemptfrom the quality control review process saying that it is too difficultto account for expenses prospectively when they are not fixed expenses.<T3>Response: </T3>Revisions to the quality control review process arebeyond the scope of these regulations.3. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters suggested that we must also amend 42 CFR435.831(c)(1) (which concerns deduction of incurred medical expenses forpurposes of establishing Medicaid eligibility of medically needy individuals).<T3>Response: </T3>On September 2, 1983, we published a proposed rule (48FR 39959) and requested public comments on revisions to regulations at42 CFR 435.732, 435.831, and 436.831. That rule proposed changes to theeligibility process commonly known as spenddown, in which incurred medicalexpenses are deducted from income in determining eligibility for Medicaid.The proposed spenddown procedures are similar to those contained in thisfinal rule, but apply only to medical deductions before an individual qualifiesfor Medicaid. Any revision to section 435.831 will be accomplished afterpublic comments are considered and when the final rule is published.4. <T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter suggested that the deduction for maintenanceof a home, specified in 42 CFR 435.725(d), should be permitted not onlyfor an individual, but also for an institutionalized couple.<T3>Response: </T3>We agree that, in order to maintain the home in casesin which both members of a couple are institutionalized temporarily, Statesshould be permitted to deduct an amount from their joint income for maintenanceof their home. In response to this comment, we are revising andSection;andSection;435.725(d), 435.733(d), 435.832(d) and 436.832(d) to permit States to deductan amount for maintenance of the home when both spouses are institutionalizedtemporarily.5. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that we revise the regulationsto permit deductions in cases in which a support obligation is court-ordereddue to separation or divorce, and the amount exceeds allowable limits.<T3>Response: </T3>The existing regulations, 42 CFR 435.725(c)(3), 435.733(c)(3),435.832(c)(3), and 436.832(c)(3), require that a State deduct an amountfrom an institutionalized recipient's income for maintenance needs of afamily at home. In applying the criteria on amounts to be deducted, wedo not make a distinction between individuals with court ordered obligationsexceeding the limits and individuals with other financial obligations abovethe limits. The same limits apply to deductions in both cases.6. <T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters suggested that we extend these revisionsto regulations at andSection;andSection; 435.726 and 435.735 on post eligibilitytreatment of income and resources of individuals receiving home and communitybased services. One commenter suggested that we should set a higher levelof protected income for housing and maintenance for individuals receivinghome and community based services, define ``medical and remedial deductions,''waive a percentage of insurance payments to individuals for medical expenses,and develop a system for validating medical expenses that does not notrequire collection of receipts from recipients and families.   <T3>Response: </T3>We will examine the regulations concerning home andcommunity based services to see if revisions are desirable, and considerissuing a proposed rule. Our consideration will involve changes to homeand community based services made by Pub. L. 99-272, the Consolidated OmnibusBudget Reconciliation Act of 1985, enacted April 7, 1986.  7. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter argued that we failed to comply with theAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) and solicit comments before we publishedthe existing final rules in October, 1978.   <T3>Response: </T3>The regulations published in October, 1978 were recodificationsof existing rules. Since those regulations were not revised policy, wewere not required to publish a proposed rule and request public commentsunder the APA.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Application of the Special Income Standard in the First 30 Daysof Institutionalization    </ITAG>We are revising our regulations to conform them to the Medicaid statuteas amended by section 9510 of the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act,Pub. L. 99-272, enacted April 7, 1986. We believe that it is unnecessaryto publish these revisions in a proposed rule because section 9510 containsclear language that leaves us no discretion in implementing the policy.(See section V._Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking.) Following is a discussionof legislative changes and background concerning State use of the optionalspecial income standard for institutionalized individuals.   Sections 1902(a)(10) and 1903(f)(4) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(10)and 1396b(f)(4)) permit States to provide Medicaid coverage to certaininstitutionalized aged, blind, or disabled individuals whose income exceedsthe payment standards for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits orState supplements to SSI benefits as established by title XVI of the Act(42 U.S.C. 1381 et seq. and 42 U.S.C. 1382e). Under this optional provision,a State determines financial eligibility for Medicaid by comparing an individual'sincome to a special income standard for institutionalized individuals.This higher institutional income standard reflects the higher cost of institutionalcare compared to the cost of residential living in the community. Individualsoften have adequate income, according to cash assistance standards, topay living expenses in a home or apartment, but inadequate income to payfor the cost of care in an institution. For example, an individual with$800 per month income in the community may be ineligible for Medicaid basedon cash assistance standards. Another individual with the same monthlyincome in an institution costing $1,000 per month may be eligible for Medicaidif a State uses a special income standard for institutionalized individuals.  Existing regulations at 42 CFR 435.722(c) provide that this special incomestandard must be applied beginning with the first full month of institutionalization.We have interpreted ``full month'' to mean that an individual must havebeen in an institution from the first day of a calendar month through thelast day of that month. Thus, individuals entering an institution afterthe first day of a month, under existing policy, are not eligible for Medicaidunder the special income standard until the following month. Thus, underexisting regulations and interpretations, an individual's days in an institutionprior to the first day of the calendar month would be disregarded in applyingthe special income standard. This interpretation parallels a requirementunder the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program that an individual'sSSI benefit is reduced if he or she has been in a medical institution throughouta full calendar month.   The existing full calendar month policy has been criticized as rigid andunfair, and can have inequitable results for recipients who have been inan institution for the same length of time as other recipients, but nota full calendar month.Recent legislation has made significant changes to the application of thespecial income standard. Section 9510 of Pub. L. 99-272, enacted April7, 1986, amends section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(V) of the Act, and requiresthat eligibility under the special institutional income standard beginwith the first day of a period of not less than 30 consecutive days ofinstitutionalization. This provision is effective with respect to paymentfor services furnished on or after October 1, 1985. We are revising 42CFR 435.722(c) to add this new provision.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Revisions to the Regulations</ITAG>We are adopting as final the proposed rule published on March 19, 1985at 50 FR 10992 with the following modifications:1. In andSection;andSection; 435.725, 435.733, 435.832, and 436.832, we areadding headings for paragraphs, for ease of reference.2. In andSection;andSection; 435.725(a), 435.733(a) and 435.832(a) and 436.832(a),we are inserting the term ``total income,'' at the end of the first sentence.We are also moving provisions of the option for agencies to project incometo a new paragraph (e) in each section listed above.3. In paragraph (c) of andSection;andSection; 435.725, 435.733, 435.832, and436.832, the cross reference in the introductory language is changed torefer to paragraph (e).4. In paragraph (d) of andSection;andSection; 435.725, 435.733, 435.832, and436.832, language is changed to refer to paragraph (e). In paragraph (d)(1)of the same sections, we are clarifying that the agency may deduct expensesfor necessary medical and remedial services included in the State plan(for the categorically needy in andSection;andSection; 435.725 and 435.733,and for the medically needy in andSection;andSection; 435.832 and 436.832)that exceed agency limitations on amount, duration, or scope of services.In paragraph (d)(2) of these same sections, we are specifying that agenciesmay deduct from couples' income in addition to single individuals, an amountfor maintenance of the home.5. We are revising 42 CFR 435.725, 435.733, 435.832, and 436.832 by addinga new paragraph (e) to each section. In (e)(1), we clarify that State agenciesmay project income over a period not to exceed 6 months; in (e)(2), werequire that States base estimates of projected income on income receivedin the preceding period, not to exceed 6 months and on income expectedto be received; and in (e)(3) we require agencies to readjust estimatesof projected income whenever significant changes occur in a recipient'sincome.6. We are revising 42 CFR 435.725, 435.733, 435.832, and 436.832 by addinga new paragraph (f) to each section. In (f)(1), we specify that, in determiningthe amount of medical expenses to be deducted from an individual's income,an agency may deduct either incurred medical expenses, or estimate andproject medical expenses for a prospective period not to exceed 6 months;In (f)(2), we require that an agency base the prospective monthly estimateof incurred medical expenses on expenses incurred in the preceding period,not to exceed 6 months and medical expenses expected to be incurred; andin (f)(3) we require that agencies adjust estimates of monthly medicalexpenses at the end of the prospective period, or when any significantchange occurs.7. Finally, we are revising 42 CFR 435.722(c) to require that States applythe special income standard for institutionalized individuals effectivewith a period of not less than 30 consecutive days of institutionalization.This revision is in accordance with the requirements of section 9510 ofPub. L. 99-272, enacted April 7, 1986. This change was not a part of theMarch 19, 1985 proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>It is our practice to publish general notice of proposed rulemaking inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>, and afford prior public comment on proposedrules. Such notice includes a statement of the nature of rulemaking proceedings,reference to the legal authority under which a rule is proposed, and theterms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjectsand issues involved. However, we do not provide a public comment periodwhen we find good cause that such a notice and comment procedure is impracticable,unnecessary or contrary to the public interest, and incorporates a statementof the finding and its reasons in the rules issued.The revisions we are making to andSection; 435.722(c) bring it in conformancewith the requirements of section 9510 of Pub. L. 99-272. The requirementsof this section of the law are very clear and not subject to interpretation.Consequently, we believe it is unnecessary to publish a proposed rule,and find good cause to waive proposed rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Impact Analysis</ITAG>A. IntroductionExecutive Order 12291 requires us to prepare and publish a regulatory impactanalysis for any regulation that is likely to:andbullet; Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;andbullet; Cause a major increase in cost or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, or local governments, agencies, or any geographicregions; orandbullet; Have significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation or on the ability of the United States based enterprisesto compete with foreign based enterprises in domestic or export markets.In addition, we prepare and publish a regulatory flexibility analysis consistentwith the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) forregulations unless the Secretary certifies that the regulations would nothave a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.For purposes of the RFA, we treat all institutional providers as smallentities. Institutional providers in any State that chooses to deduct someor all of a recipient's income spent on noncovered medical services willbe directly affected. We also consider providers of noninstitutional services,such as physicians, dentists, and pharmacists, to be small entities. Althoughthis rule may not directly affect the latter entities, it may affect theamount of income institutionalized recipients have available for the purchaseof medically necessary services not covered by the Medicaid State plan,which may, in turn, have an economic effect on providers of the noncoveredmedical services. Thus, it is clear that this final rule will affect asubstantial number of small entities.In the proposed rule, we stated that the regulations would have a savingseffect of between 0 and $28 million, thus not requiring us to treat thisas a ``major rule''. In view of this relatively small effect on total Medicaidexpenditures, we also determined that the proposed rule would not havea significant economic impact on small entities as defined under the RFA.<T3>Comment:</T3> We received two comments questioning the estimated savingsamount to be gained from the proposed rule. They claimed that our estimatedsavings figures were too low and the actual impact will be in excess of$100 million. On this basis, the commenters argued that we had not providednecessary analyses.<T3>Response:</T3> In order to verify our initial estimates of the savingsimpact these regulations will have on State and Federal expenditures, wereexamined the assumptions and the data upon which our initial estimatewas based. As a result of our reexamination, we have determined that theeffect of these regulations could be in excess of $100 million a year withinthe five year period from the date these regulations become effective.Therefore, we have decided to treat this rule as a major rule and to conductan impact analysis. Also, because the impact on small entities may be significant,we are conducting a regulatory flexibility analysis.B. Objectives of the RegulationsAs explained in section I of this preamble, section 1902(a)(17) of theAct gives the Secretary broad authority to define income for purposes ofdetermining continued Medicaid eligiblity. Under current regulations, oncean institutionalized person is determined to be eligible, and continuesto meet the income requirements, a State must deduct the cost of all noncoveredmedical expenses from the recipient's income. Some States have argued thatthis requirement forces them to subsidize medical services they have electednot to cover under their State plan. By excluding the cost of such noncoveredservices from a recipient's income, the State is indirectly paying forthe services even though the State has chosen not to provide certain services,or to limit services with respect to amount, duration, or scope.In addition, by reducing the amount of a recipient's available income,a State must pay a larger share of the recipient's institutional care coststhan it would otherwise have to pay, if it could include, as income, theamounts paid by recipients for noncovered services. Permitting a Stateto include amounts currently paid for noncovered medical services as incomeenables the State to shift more of the financial responsibility for thecost of nursing home care to the recipient, thereby permitting the Stateto reduce its reimbursement to the institution for institutional care.It also allows the State to eliminate the indirect subsidy for noncoveredservices.These regulations will permit States to include, as income, any amountsa recipient spends for services that are not covered under the State'sMedicaid plan. This provision also may be applied to those services uponwhich the State has set limits with respect to amount, duration, or scope.In either instance, a State has discretion over when, how, and to whatextent it will consider a recipient's expenses for noncovered or coveredmedical services that exceed a State's limits on amount, duration, or scope.For example, a State may elect to exclude (that is, not count as availableincome) a recipient's expenses for certain noncovered services, and notothers. Another possible approach is for a State to establish reasonablelimits on the amount, duration or scope of covered or noncovered servicesfor which it will exclude expenses from a recipient's income, Thus, Stateshave several alternatives, which may be employed in various combinationsof approaches, in excluding or including amounts expended by recipientsfor noncovered medical expenses as income.The most likely approach we believe States will take under these regulationsis to restrict the income deductions for those services that the Statebelieves have marginal or questionable therapeutic value. By limiting theamount of income a recipient spends on such questionable services (eitherwith respect to the entire service, or limited to the scope or amount),the State can discourage the recipient from using his or her income topurchase medical services of dubious value.C. Projected ImpactSince the revisions we are implementing give States the option to consideras income money a recipient spends on noncovered services (or serviceswhich exceed a State's limits), but does not require them to do so, itis difficult to predict precisely the impact of this rule on States, recipientsand providers. Many factors will influence the course of action individualStates adopt with respect to these revisions. In deciding how best to implementthese revised rules, States will examine the needs of their institutionalizedrecipients, their current policies on noncovered services, the averageincome of institutionalized recipients residing in the respective States,budget constraints and other local issues specific to each State.In keeping with the uncertainty over how States will react to the addedflexibility in determining recipients income granted under these regulations,we have examined the sensitivity of estimates of Federal and State Medicaidprogram savings to two key assumptions: the number of recipients affected(which is dependent on the number of States that elect to exercise theflexibility authorized under this rule), and the average monthly savingsper recipient realized by the States as a whole (which is dependent onboth the available income of recipients currently spent on noncovered services,and the amount of that income that States elect to include).It is impossible to predict exactly which States would include this income.However, we assume that enough States would do so to affect at least 20percent of all institutionalized Medicaid recipients, and it is possiblethat as many as 50 percent of recipients could be affected. It is conceivablethat less than 20 percent or more than 50 percent of recipients would beaffected, but we view it as unlikely.\1\<NOTE/> In a similar manner, we have assumed that the average monthlysavings per recipient (which would be shared by the States and the Federalgovernment) would probably fall between $50 and $75 a month. In particularStates, annual per recipient savings could be higher or lower.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Based on an unduplicated count of recipients in skillednursing facilities, (SNFs) intermediate care facilities (ICFs) and intermediatecare facilities for the mentally retarded (ICFs/MR), the total number ofinstitutionalized recipients reported for fiscal year (FY) 1984 was 1.488million.Based on these variables, and assuming a May 1, 1988 implementation date,we have developed a low estimate (assuming that only 20 percent of recipientwould be affected and that monthly savings per recipients would average$50) and a high estimate (assuming that 50 percent of recipients wouldbe affected and that monthly savings per recipient would average $75),as follows: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>10,L2,tp9,p7,7/8,i1,s10,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11 </C><T4>Fiscal Year (FY) Savings </T4>(Rounded to Nearest $5 Million) <H1>Assumptions used </H1><H1>1988 </H1><H2>Federal </H2><H2>State </H2><H2>Total </H2><H1>1989 </H1><H2>Federal </H2><H2>State </H2><H2>Total </H2><H1>1990 </H1><H2>Federal </H2><H2>State </H2><H2>Total </H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Low <D>$5,000,000 </D><D>0 </D><D>$5,000,000 </D><D>$25,000,000 </D><D>$20,000,000 </D><D>$45,000,000 </D><D>$45,000,000 </D><D>$40,000,000 </D><D>$85,000,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">High <D>10,000,000 </D><D>10,000,000 </D><D>20,000,000 </D><D>100,000,000 </D><D>80,000,000 </D><D>180,000,000 </D><D>170,000,000 </D><D>140,000,000 </D><D>310,000,000 </D></ITAG></ITAG> The assumptions concerning the amount of money recipients currently spendon noncovered services, which underlie our assumptions on average annualsavings per recipient, deserve some discussion. Typically, an institutionalizedrecipient is female, over 85 years old, and receives some form of income.The most common source of income is Social Security survivors benefits.Almost all institutionalized recipients would be eligible for SSI benefitsbut for the fact that they are in a Medicaid certified institution. Also,because almost all of the recipients are over 65, they are eligible toreceive Medicare Part A benefits as well as Medicaid. In addition, mostStates ``buy-in'' to the part B program by paying the premium, deductible,and copayments for their dually eligible recipients, thereby enabling themto receive additional inpatient and outpatient services that may not becovered under Medicaid. While we do not have exact information on the average institutionalizedrecipient's income level, we estimate the median income for a nursing homepatient receiving Medicaid benefits is approximately $583 per month, andmay range as high as $853 per month. These estimates are based on Bureauof the Census data and maximum allowable income levels for Medicaid institutionalizedrecipients. Based on the available data, we estimate that institutionalizedrecipients in States that provide a more complete range of optional services(``generous'' States) may deduct from patient income up to $300 per monthfor noncovered services. We believe that, ultimately, such ``generous''States will not choose to deduct all such expenses from income, but willreduce the amount protected for noncovered services by $50 to $75 per month.States that are less generous in allowing expenses for noncovered services,naturally, also may seek to cut the protected amount. However, States withfewer covered services and more restrictive income criteria also generallyare States with the poorest populations. Thus, recipients in these Stateshave very little extra income to spend on noncovered services. As a result,we believe that the ``poorer'' States, also, will only be able to savefrom $50 to $75 per month institutionalized recipient. D. Impact on Small Entities These regulations could save from $160 to $615 million (combined Federaland State savings) for fiscal years 1987 through 1989 through transferringa portion of the cost of institutional care from the State to the recipient.However, while a State will be permitted to count more of recipients' incomeas available for paying for their institutional care, under current regulations,States may not force recipients to apply their income toward their nursinghome care. We expect some States, as a result of exercising the flexibilityavailable under these rules, will reduce the total amount they pay to SNFs,ICFs, and in some cases to ICFs/MR for the care of recipients. To protect themselves from financial harm, SNFs, ICFs, and affected ICFs/MRwill probably seek to adopt strategies to ensure that recipients will compensatethem for the reduction in State payments. Because the institution is generallyin a position to deny admission to Medicaid recipients without sufferingfinancially, it seems likely that some will persuade newly admitted recipientsto apply their available income toward their institutional care ratherthan for the noncovered services. However, we doubt that abuses will occurin this area because of the likelihood of adverse publicity to the institutionconcerned as well as possible local restrictions on the actions of nursinginstitutions in such matters. Also, we believe that in most cases, recipientsvoluntarily will assume the additional cost of paying for their institutionalcare and forego some of the noncovered services. In many cases, these noncoveredservices are of marginal value, and when faced with the choice of eithercontributing a larger share of their income toward their maintenance andcare in the nursing home or paying for medical services whose benefitsare questionable, we believe that most recipients will elect the formeroption of paying for their institutional care. Based on this assessment of the impact of the change in the rules for posteligibility income determination, it appears highly likely that the majorimpact of this regulation will fall on providers of noninstitutional servicessuch as physicians, dentists, and physical and occupational therapists.Since each State imposes its own set of restrictions on the various typesof services available in the State, it is impossible to know how the effectsof these rules will be distributed.  <T3>E. Application of the Special Income Standard  </T3>We have determined that the revision to the regulations that establishesMedicaid eligibility from the first day of a stay of at least 30 days ina medical institution will not result in an annual economic effect of $100million or meet the other thresholds in section 1(b) of the Order. Ouractuaries estimate that this proposal would result in total annual costsof $9 million beginning in FY 1988 ($5 million Federal costs and $4 millionState costs). Even though these costs depend on the number of States thatchoose to apply the special income standard as described, we have betterdata on which to base a cost estimate because we know that there are 17States that use the special income standard and can project the extentto which the Medicaid institutionalized population could be affected. Establishing Medicaid eligibility from the first day of a stay of at least30 days will benefit those who, to date, have paid the cost of care forthose days prior to the first full month of institutionalization. We believethat this change will primarily benefit recipients and family members whoare paying these costs for institutional care.  <ITAG tagnum="84">VII.
