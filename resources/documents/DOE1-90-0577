<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-90-0577 </DOCNO><TEXT>It has been shown that propagation of lower hybrid rays sometimes involvescases where three types of waves are coupled through linear mode conversionin the same region of space, namely the cold lower hybrid wave, the warmlower hybrid wave, and an ion Bernstein mode. This three wave mode conversionproblem is analyzed in terms of a sixth order differential equation whichdescribes coupling between all branches, and analytic coupling coefficientsare found for the case without the local absorption term. The formalsolution of this equation shows that a non-trivial amount of the incidentcold wave energy goes into an ion Bernstein mode, which is then absorbedby electrons via Landau damping, rather than converting into the warmbranch totally, when they are closely coupled in space.</TEXT></DOC>
