Front-runner Fernando Collor de Mello claimed Sarney has ``asinister plan'' to manipulate the Nov. 15 election by backing thelast-minute candidacy of Silvio Santos, head of Brazil'ssecond-largest television network.   ``I'm talking to you, Jose Sarney. I'm talking to anirresponsible, dishonest and weak man,'' Collor de Mello said inhis spot on a 70-minute television campaign program, which all fivenetworks are required to run twice a day.   Collor de Mello, leader of the center-right NationalReconstruction Party, called Sarney ``incapable, incompetent andcorrupt.''   Sarney declared he would respond to Collor de Mello'saccusations with an address on national television.   Santos' candidacy also was denounced by other leaders among the22 presidential candidates.   In a televised debate Sunday night, Leonel Brizola of thecenter-left Democratic Labor Party called Santos ``a test-tubecandidate'' of the Sarney administration.   Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the leftist Workers Party comparedthe Santos candidacy to a ``coup d'etat'' against the electoralprocess.   Both Sarney and Santos, conservative candidate of the newBrazilian Municipalist Party, deny allegations that they areengaged in a joint political effort.   Sarney, who by law cannot run for re-election, opposes Collor deMello and polls have shown that Santos' late entry in the racecaused a sharp reduction in Collor de Mello's lead.   Santos presented his candidacy officially to the SuperiorElectoral Court on Saturday, and it is being challenged.   A law decreed in 1970, when Brazil was under a militarydictatorship, that directors of government-licensed businesses,such as television stations and networks, must resign from suchpositions at least three months before elections if they arecandidates.   Santos' lawyers say although he is the main stockholder in theSBT network he is not an active director and the law should notapply to him.   Jose Francsco Rezek, president of the seven-member electoralcourt, said the tribunal would rule on the legality of Santos'candidacy by Friday.   Rezek noted the 1970 law was adopted during military rule andsaid the main issue for the electoral court will be to determinewhich points of that law ``have survived'' under Brazil's newconstitution written in 1988.   Santos is not among the 22 candidates listed on the ballots,which have gone out to Brazil's 250,000 polling stations. To votefor Santos, Brazilians will have to draw an `X' through the boxnext to the name of Armando Correa, the Municipalist Partycandidate who withdrew to be replaced by Santos.   If no candidate gets a majority a runoff will be held betweenthe two top vote-getters.</TEXT></DOC>
