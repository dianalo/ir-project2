The maker of computers and business information processing equipment boosted its quarterly payout to 25 cents a share from 23 cents, payable April 24 to stock of record March 13. It was the 11th consecutive annual dividend increase.    NCR directors also authorized the company to buy four million of its shares over the next two years. A spokesman said the company considered the buyback &quot;an appropriate way to enhance shareholder value.&quot; At Dec. 31, NCR had 93,984,000 shares outstanding.    The company said it will use the repurchased shares for general purposes. It declined to elaborate on the buyback plan, other than to say it expected to make the purchases &quot;at times and prices considered to be advantageous.&quot;    The latest buyback plan is in addition to a similar program begun last May. Under the earlier plan, NCR also said it expected to buy four million shares over a two-year period. The company said it has thus far repurchased about two million of those shares.    In consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading, NCR shares closed at $56.75, up 75 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
