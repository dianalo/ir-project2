On an average, the 2 million square kilometers of mostlydesert lands of Saudi Arabia receive 5000 Kcal/m/sup 2/ every day ofsolar energy. Saudi Arabia is planning to develop the solar technologyfor the best utilization of solar radiation. This paper will discussthe available solar energy collected in Saudi Arabia as well as theirpotential uses. Conventional utilization of solar energy such as waterheaters, room heaters, agriculture, drying and desalination will be mentionedtogether with recent solar energy uses in electrical power and hydrogenproduction from water. The current fundamental research in the countrywill also be discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
