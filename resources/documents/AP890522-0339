In an interview with The Milwaukee Journal, Brady said massivebuying that pushed the dollar to a 19-month high Monday in Tokyohad to be viewed in terms of world unrest.   ``You have a million Chinese rioting in the streets,'' he said.``You have NATO in an unsettled state of affairs. You have, inJapan, lack of clear definition of leadership really for the firsttime since the second World War. So it doesn't surprise me thatpeople pause for a moment and want to put their money in a countrywhere the people have settled their leadership question.''   Brady was in Milwaukee mainly to speak to about 750 businesspeople and educators at the Baird-Manegold Lecture Series at thePfister Hotel, sponsored by the University of Wisconsin-MilwaukeeSchool of Business Administration and Robert W. Baird andamp; Co. Inc.   The dollar has soared in foreign exchange during recent weeksdespite waves of dollar-selling for government central banks. Thedollar on Monday traded at levels not seen since December 1986against the West German mark and since October 1987 against theJapanese yen.   The White House on Monday, in an apparent coordinated effortwith the Federal Reserve Board, issued a statement in Washingtondeclaring that a further rise could ``undermine internationalefforts to reduce global trade imbalances.''   The statement, the first time the White House has commenteddirectly on the dollar since President Bush took office, appearedto be tied to a late-morning selloff of dollars by the FederalReserve in international currency markets, traders and analystssaid.   Brady also indicated that recent jumps in inflation stemmedpartly from one-time factors such as higher energy prices due tothe Alaska oil spill and higher food prices caused by last year'sdrought.   ``The figures I look at, without energy and food, are prettycalm,'' Brady said.   In remarks prepared for the luncheon, Brady said that for theUnited States to sustain and strengthen its position as a worldeconomic leader in the next century, the government must play arole in coordinating economic policies with major trading partners,in working to abolish barriers to free trade and in reducing thecost of capital to corporations.   Efforts to coordinate economic policies with trading partnershelped reduce the U.S. trade deficit last year by $34 billion toabout $127 billion, Brady stated.</TEXT></DOC>
