(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man who took three hostages at acounty courthouse surrendered peacefully to authorities Wednesday,ending a 23-hour standoff during which he released his captives butreported his wife killed herself.   Kevin Patrick Firth, 30, was taken into custody at 9:15 a.m.,police Sgt. Greg Kuhn said. He had reported four hours earlier thathis wife, Helen, had committed suicide.   Authorities were uncertain, pending an autopsy, whether thewoman had killed herself or was shot to death by her husband, MesaCounty District Attorney Steve ErkenBrack said.   The standoff began Tuesday morning when Firth's wife slipped hima gun, and the two took three hostages just prior to the jailedFirth's hearing on sexual assault charges. A jailer was sprayed inthe face with Mace during the apparent escape attempt, authoritiessaid.   Mrs. Firth said she had smuggled explosives into the courthouse,according to police. During the standoff, Firth threatened to blowup the two-story building.   A bomb squad searched the courthouse after Firth was taken intocustody, but no explosives were found, authorities said.   ErkenBrack said hostages had reported seeing wire, tape andround objects inside the courthouse. ``There apparently wassomething there to make the hostages believe there wereexplosives,'' he said.   The hostages, court clerks Joyce Bailey and Sheila Shumway andreceptionist Linda Romersberger, were released one at a time, thelast walking out about 2 a.m. Wednesday.   Shumway, the first to be set free, said Firth made the hostageslie on the floor in a judge's chambers.   ``We huddled together for two hours, holding hands andpraying,'' she said.   Shumway said she was more frightened of Mrs. Firth than of Firthhimself. ``She was aggressive, and nervous and mad,'' she saidduring a news conference by the three hostages Wednesday. ``He wasrelatively calm, but I was only there for two hours.''   Shumway said she thought Firth meant to kill her when he toldher she was going home.   ``He told us not to cry and I said: `I'm sorry. I'm scared.' Andhe said, `You get up. You're going home.' I thought he meant he wasgoing to kill me.   ``Those 10 steps to the door, to the landing, was the longestwalk of my life.''   Authorities said Firth appeared willing to give himself up about3:30 a.m., but his wife balked and threatened many times todetonate explosives.   At 5:10 a.m., Firth used a police radio he had taken to reportthat his wife had shot herself. When negotiators tried to calm himdown, he said:, ``I can't. I've got to be with her. It's too late.''   Police said they believe the incident began as an abortiveescape attempt. But Firth made no demands, except to talk withinvestigtors about the sexual assault case pending against him,authorities said.   Firth, a Delta auto mechanic, was released from prison inOctober after serving time on a rape conviction.   He was arrested again on March 8 and charged with first-degreesexual assault and kidnapping in the Feb. 24 attack on a grocerystore employee.   ErkenBrack said Firth faces possible charges including taking ofhostages, kidnapping, a felon in possession of a weapon and being ahabitual criminal.</TEXT></DOC>
