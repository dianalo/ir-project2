Analysts credited the rebound, in part, to the strongparticipation of baby boomers in the housing market, saying theirnumbers alone should help keep sales steady in 1989 despiteforecasts of higher mortgage rates.   The National Association of Realtors said existing single-familyhomes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.71 millionunits in November, compared to an October sales pace of 3.67 millionunits.   Sales had shown no improvement at all in October after droppingby 1.1 percent in September.   Sales of new homes have been rising as well. In October, sales ofnew single-family homes climbed to 733,000 units, the highest levelin 20 months. The government will report new home sales for Novemberon Friday.   Analysts attributed the sales upswing in part to a growing numberof buyers in the marketplace.   ``The fact is, the bulk of the baby boom is now being felt inhousing markets across the country,'' said John Tuccillo, chiefeconomist for the Realtors group. ``The strong pace of existing homesales in November is more a tribute to the numbers of buyers out inthe market than it is to any particular short-term economicconditions.''   The November gain was the first increase since a 2.2 percent riselast August.   The price of an existing home edged down slightly to $87,900 inNovember, compared to an October median price of $88,100.   Tuccillo said he expected home sale prices nationally to increase4.8 percent for all of 1988, about in line with the overall rise inconsumer prices. That would be down from a 6.6 percent priceincrease recorded in 1987.   The price moderation was attributed to a shift in sales from themore expensive markets of the Northeast to the less expensivemarkets in the Midwest.   The Northeast remained the most expensive place to buy a homewith a median price of $142,500 in November, up 5.9 percent from ayear ago. The typical home in the West sold for $122,300 inNovember, up 6 percent from a year ago.   Homes in the South sold for $80,300 in November, an increase of1.4 percent from a year earlier, while the Midwest remained theleast expensive housing area at $66,700, an increase of 3.6 percentfrom a year ago.   Many economists had been expecting a drop in sales of both newand existing homes in 1989 because of rising mortgage rates. Lastweek, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 10.68 percent and manyanalysts are predicting they will hit 11.5 percent by spring.   However, Tuccillo said the large number of adults in their 30sand 40s who are looking for homes had prompted him to revise hisoutlook for 1989 to show sales of around 3.38 million, down only 4.2percent from an expected 3.53 million sales this year.   In November, the sales increase was led by a 4.6 percent rise insales in the Northeast, which climbed to an annual rate of 680,000units, up 3 percent from a year ago.   Sales were up 4.3 percent in the Midwest, to an annual rate of960,000 units. This is 7.9 percent above the sales rate a year agoas this region continues to benefit from a boom in export sales bymanufacturing companies.   Sales were unchanged in the South, at an annual rate of 1.40million units but this was 11.1 percent higher than a year ago,reflecting the fact that the region has begun to recover somewhatfrom depressed conditions caused by a slump in the oil patch.   The West was the only region of the country reporting amonth-to-month sales decline, a 7 percent setback, which left theannual sales pace at 660,000 units, still nearly 18 percent higherthan a year ago.</TEXT></DOC>
