The modifying effects of the drugs are discussedin terms of possible mechanisms. In addition, it should be noted thatthe membrane-specific drugs exhibit toxicity preferentially toward cellsunder conditions of hypoxia and that they can potentiate hyperthermickilling in bacterial and mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo.</TEXT></DOC>
