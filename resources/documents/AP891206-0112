Troops opened fire in the West Bank town of Nablus to dispersedemonstrators, wounding eight Palestinians, hospital officialssaid. Six Arabs were shot by troops in stone-throwing clashes inGaza, they said.   The army imposed a curfew that will confine Gaza's 750,000residents to their homes beginning Thursday to head off possibleprotests Friday, when the uprising enters its third year. A similarcurfew was expected for the West Bank.   Soldiers also demolished three houses of Palestinians suspectedin attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians.   Palestinian spokesman Faisal Husseini, who lives in the Arabsector of Jerusalem annexed by Israel, was banned by the army fromentering the occupied territories for six months. He accusedauthorities of trying to increase tension among Palestinians in theoccupied territories.   The army orders said the travel ban against Husseini, 49, wastaken ``for the sake of ensuring public peace, the defense of thearea and the establishment of public order.''   A military official said Husseini was involved in ``incitementagainst the authorities, against the army.'' The official, whoinsisted on anonymity, gave no details.   Husseini, a pro-PLO activist, was released from prison inJanuary after being held for 18 months without charge or trial. Buthe has since been invited to several meetings by Israeli officialsseeking his views on peace prospects.   Husseini said in an interview that the army action ``was notwarranted.''   He noted that his trips to the occupied territories have largelydealt with settling disputes among various Palestinian factions.   ``Apparently the occupiers are looking for more fights among thepeople, possibly to justify their staying there,'' Husseini said.   In Jerusalem, Rabin told a Parliament debate on the uprisingthat while the army has not succeeded in quelling the revolt, hebelieved Israel eventually would convince Palestinian activiststhey can gain nothing by violence.   ``I am convinced that we mustn't under any circumstances give into violence and must use every path to show those that deal inviolence they will pay a heavy and painful price,'' he said.   However, Rabin also said in remarks to soldiers that werebroadcast on Israel radio that the rebellion may last ``anotheryear or two.''   At least 626 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiersor civilians in the rebellion; 155 Palestinians have been slain byfellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with Israel; and43 Israelis have died.   In Nablus, six protest marches involving hundreds of peopleerupted during a two-hour relaxation by the army of a curfew thathas been imposed since Friday, Palestinian reporters said.   The protesters waved outlawed Palestinian flags and chanted theywould avenge the deaths of four members of a gang called the BlackPanthers who were killed by soldiers on Friday, Arab witnesses said.   Eight people were shot and wounded in clashes with soldiers inthe city's old market, or Casbah, and the nearby Balata refugeecamp, hospital officials said. One victim was a 14-year-old boyshot in the back, the officials said.   The army confirmed two injuries.   Six Palestinians were shot and wounded in stone-throwing clasheswith Israeli troops in the Gaza Strip, hospitals reported.   Also in Gaza on Wednesday, several hundred Israeli settlersstaged demonstrations protesting the Israeli decision to beginadmitting 5,800 Palestinians from Egypt. The Palestinians ended upon the Egyptian side of the border when Israel returned the Sinaito Egypt under the 1979 Camp David peace accords.   Datya Hershkowitz, a spokeswoman for the settlers, accusedIsrael of admitting people ``trained as terrorists'' during theiryears in Egypt and described it as ``a birthday present for theuprising.''   The first to be admitted were five men and several sons, whowill build houses and then bring the rest of their families.</TEXT></DOC>
