The announcement, which came after the close of tradingyesterday, startled grain analysts. U.S. grain prices havebeen slumping in recent sessions in large part because theBush administration had signaled that any credit offer mighttake several more weeks to arrange.</LP><TEXT>   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that thegrain-buying credit will be offered to the Soviet Union inthree parts over the next nine months. The U.S. government isoffering to immediately make available $600 million incredit, and then is offering $500 million in October and $400million in February.   If Moscow accepts the offer, most grain traders expect itto quickly begin purchasing large amounts of U.S. crops. Lastwinter, the Soviet Union immediately spent a $1 billionpackage of U.S. credit on U.S. corn and soybean meal.   Daniel W. Basse, director of market research at AgResourceCo., Chicago, said that at current prices Moscow could usethe credit available to it this year to buy as much as fivemillion metric tons of U.S. corn, as much as 2.5 millionmetric tons of U.S. wheat and roughly 400,000 metric tons ofsoybean meal. Moscow might also use the U.S. credits to buyother products such as pork and vegetable oils.   The Bush administration was leaning against the Sovietrequest in April amid worries about Moscow'scredit-worthiness. But the Soviet Union is almost too big ofa customer to ignore. With Moscow out of the market much oflast year, U.S. grain exports withered.   The U.S. offer clears the way for Moscow to satisfy itsobligations under a long-term trade agreement to buy U.S.crops.   Wheat prices are also expected to rise today in the wakeof the Agriculture Department's decision to trim its harvestestimate for soft red winter wheat.   After the close of trading yesterday, the AgricultureDepartment lowered its soft red winter wheat estimate to400.2 million bushels from its May estimate of 461 millionbushels.   Midwest wheat yields are falling because an unusually wetand warm spring is allowing fungus and plant diseases toweaken the crop. Earlier this week, the government rated 59%of Illinois's impending wheat harvest in poor to very poorcondition. During the previous week, 48% of the Illinois cropwas rated in that condition.   Meanwhile, good growing weather in the southern Plainsstates allowed the Agriculture Department to raise itsharvest estimate for the hard red winter wheat crop grownthere. The government raised its estimate for that variety to890.2 million bushels from the 874 million bushels itprojected in May.   Wheat prices jumped yesterday because the White Houseauthorized China to buy two million metric tons of subsidizedU.S. wheat.   The move follows President Bush's decision in recent weeksto renew preferential trade status with China despitedispleasure in Congress over China's arms control and humanrights records.   In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the soft redwinter wheat contract for July delivery rose 5.5 cents abushel to settle at $2.985. Wheat prices also rose at thegrain exchanges in Kansas City, Mo., and Minneapolis.   Under a program designed to fuel exports, the AgricultureDepartment compensates exporters that sell discountpricedwheat to targeted countries such as China.   China bought 3.8 million metric tons of U.S. wheat duringthe 12 months ended May 31, and has already arranged to takedelivery of an additional 2.4 million metric tons. Thisactivity doesn't include the new amount authorized by theBush administration.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Petroleum futures rallied on the New YorkMercantile Exchange just before trading closed 20 minutesearly because of a computer problem. After falling to atwo-month low on Monday, crude oil for July delivery roseyesterday 12 cents a barrel to settle at $19.96. August crudewas up 11 cents at $20.07. Gasoline and heating oil contractsalso were higher. Traders attributed the gains to a generalbelief the market may have been oversold in recent sessions.But except for a burst of activity after the sudden warningof the early close trading was light. Traders were cautiousin advance of the American Petroleum Institute's weeklyreport on industry data. The report, released after futurestrading had closed, was even more bearish than expected. Thefigures showed that inventories of crude oil and gasolineincreased last week by much more than had been anticipated.Inventories of crude were up 3.6 million barrels while thosefor gasoline increased nearly 2.4 million barrels.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices rose on labor developments in SouthAmerica. After trading as high as $1.021 a pound, copper forJuly delivery ended at $1.007, up 1.5 cents. Unions in Perucalled for a national miners' strike beginning on Monday,analysts said, but they added that threatened strikes in therecent past didn't materialize. Labor negotiations in Chilealso appear to be hitting some snags, and workers werescheduled to vote last night on extending a go-slow action,analysts said. When the price rose above $1, buying based ontechnical factors pushed the price up further.                                                                                                          ALUMINUM: Prices surged in London following ReynoldsMetals Co.'s announcement Monday that it plans to temporarilyclose three of five aluminum production lines at an Oregonplant. After trading as high as $1,360 a metric ton, thethreemonth aluminum bid price at the close of the second ringof trading on the London Metal Exchange was $1,338, up $86.Aluminum prices are still low. Last week, the metal hit afour-year low of $1,250, off more than 40% from the recentpeak of $2,125 last September. Also contributing to the pricerise yesterday was a deeper analysis of statistics releasedby International Primary Aluminum Institute of London onMonday, said Fred Demler, metals economist at PaineWebber.The institute said April producer inventories were 40,000metric tons higher than in March and, at 3,350,000 metrictons, were at the highest levels since August 1989. A metricton equals 2,204.62 pounds. But the report also noted adecline in inventories in North America, which was a surpriseconsidering the weak economy, said Mr. Demler. In addition,consumption appears to be picking up: World-wide shipments inApril grew by almost 4% after falling 1% in the first quarterand 7% in the fourth quarter 1990, he said. Domesticproduction through April was up 2% from a year earlier, saidJohn E. Gross, a West Nyack, N.Y., metals consultant. So,even after taking into account the Reynolds shutdown aluminumproduction remains strong, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
