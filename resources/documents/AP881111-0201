(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An anchorwoman was fired after she wrotein a Christian magazine that religious considerations figured intoher news judgments.   ``Naturally, I have to lead with the hard news stories thataffect our neighborhood and world ... but it's such a thrill to alsohave the power to `sneak' Jesus into the news as often aspossible,'' KDLT-TV weekend anchor Marilee Joyce wrote.   On numerous occasions she used her position to prevent broadcastof network stories that she said were of ``questionable nature,''she wrote in Good News, a magazine published by TEAM Television, aChristian cable television station.   These included series on the New Age movement and on the HareKrishna religion. ``I decided it would not be good to fill ourviewers' minds with such information, so I didn't permit the storiesto air,'' Joyce wrote.   Steven Herman, KDLT president and general manager, said Joyce wasfired Tuesday for ``an error in journalistic judgment,'' reflectedin the article headlined ``A Different Type of TV Evangelism.''   ``I don't want to make it a public issue,'' Herman said Thursday.``I don't think it's in her best interest to battle out in the presswhat's really a personal, private decision between Marilee Joyce andmyself.''   Joyce, 25, worked as an anchor, reporter and producer at the NBCaffiliate since April, and on weekends she was responsible fordeciding which stories were broadcast. She said she was devastatedat being fired.   ``I am a news professional and I conducted myself in thatmanner,'' she said. ``I have been precautioned by my advisers not tosay anything further.''   In the article, Joyce criticized television producers for theirreluctance to broadcast ``good news'' stories, and she criticizedviewers for their appetite for ``bad news.''   Joyce also described how she assigned several stories withreligious angles, including an interview with a local Christianauthor and a story on a anti-abortion agency.</TEXT></DOC>
