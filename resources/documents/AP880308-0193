Solomon Schwartz, 52, of Monsey, was sought out by the CIA in1982 and later had contact with the Defense Intelligence Agencyconcerning the possible purchase of the Soviet T-72 tanks, whichthe U.S. government wanted to study for intelligence purposes, saidattorney Lawrence Dubin.   Schwartz negotiated with three Polish generals for the tanks butthe sale never materialized, Dubin said in his opening statement atthe trial of Schwartz and three co-defendants, who are also armsdealers.   The defendants are accused of plotting four illegal weaponsdeals, including smuggling military equipment to the Argentiniangovernment during the Falkland Islands War and an unsuccessfulattempt to ship guns to Iraq.   ``They were willing to sell to anyone, no matter whose hands theweapons fell into, if the price was right,'' said Assistant U.S.Attorney Larry Krantz.   The Argentinian deal, the only one that went through, includedthe shipment of 1,300 night vision goggles and resulted in a profitof $1 million for the defendants, Krantz said.   The prosecutor charged that Schwartz would use the Soviet tankdeal to ``cover up'' one of the illegal arms deals, a shipment of500 automatic rifles and ammunition destined for Poland but seizedby U.S. Customs agents at John F. Kennedy Airport in February 1984.   Dubin said the weapons were to be shipped to Poland but thenwould be immediately re-shipped to Mexico, using a legal exportlicense, by an independent trading company.   He said the arms shipment to Poland was needed to establish ``acourse of routine business'' in Poland to facilitate any possiblefuture dealings involving the Soviet tanks.   Schwartz, the owner of Texas Armament Advisors Inc., willtestify during the trial about the tank deal, Dubin said.   The other illegal arms shipments alleged in the indictmentinvolved 110 boxes of handguns, shotguns and ammunition destinedfor Iraq but seized by Belgian authorities; and 400 night visiondevices to the Soviet Union in a sting operation orchestrated byU.S. Customs. All took place between 1982 and 1984.   ``Although these weapons are routinely bought and sold in theU.S., the export of these weapons are highly regulated by thegovernment,'' Krantz said. ``The defendants were caught red-handedparticipating in a series of illegal arms transactions.''   The other defendants are H. Leonard Berg, 52, of the Bronx,owner of HLB Security Electronics Ltd. of Manhattan; GrimDePanicis, 44, of Mount Dora, Fla., a vice president of HLB; LeonLisbona, 63, of Queens, an HLB employee.   Berg, Lisbona and Schwartz are charged with racketeering,racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud and violating arms export lawsand are accused of participating in all four illegal deals.   DePanicis is not charged with any of the racketeering counts andis named only in the Argentinian and Soviet Union deals.   Krantz said the trial was expected to last several weeks andwould include secretly recorded conversations.</TEXT></DOC>
