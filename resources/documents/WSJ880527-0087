The Defense Science Board's SDI task force has concluded that the U.S. could begin to deploy a limited antimissile defense right now, if the Reagan administration had the will to ask for it.    For too long, the SDI debate has been caught in a false dilemma. The President sticks to his admirable but visionary ideal of a leak-proof antimissile Astrodome, while SDI opponents dismiss any defense at all as a threat to their theories of mutual assured destruction. In between, however, the technology exists for gradually deploying a partial defense that could significantly enhance the credibility of America's existing nuclear deterrent.    &quot;There are a number of possible ways in which a ballistic-missile defense system might be deployed in steps,&quot; says the Defense Science Board report. The task force didn't specify any single plan, but it did lay out a &quot;possible&quot; direction, starting with &quot;a limited deployment of long-range, ground-based interceptors.&quot;    The task force said it was &quot;favorably impressed&quot; by proposals for such a deployment, and listed some advantages. &quot;Capability would be limited . . . but a thin defense over much of the country would provide some preferential defense against small attacks, and some protection against accidental, unauthorized launches and against third-country attacks and threats of blackmail.&quot; The Science Board's members understand that missile technology is starting to spread to nations such as Saudi Arabia; in time, the Soviets may not pose the only nuclear threat.    Such a deployment wouldn't violate the 1972 ABM Treaty, moreover, though it might help prevent the Soviets from breaking out of that treaty themselves. The Soviets already have their own anti-missile system deployed around Moscow, but the U.S. has only research. By starting the production lines rolling and deploying its own limited system, the U.S. would at least be prepared when the Soviets do break out. And U.S. scientists and engineers would gain valuable experience that could pay off in later SDI stages in space.    Support for a ground-based missile defense continues to build in Congress, by the way. Two weeks ago, Wyoming Republican Malcolm Wallop offered an amendment on the Senate floor to put $100 million of the SDI budget toward the deployment of an Accidental Launch Protection System, or ALPS, of the kind described in the Defense Science Board report. The amendment got 37 votes, even though the White House stayed neutral.    Nebraska Democrat James Exon scrambled to explain that while the amendment had merit, he opposed it because it &quot;complicates our relationship&quot; with anti-SDI members of the House. In other words, the Senate should give a higher priority to the partisan obsessions of the House Democratic Caucus than to the national interest. Georgia Senator Sam Nunn also opposed the amendment, though only a few months ago he gave a speech urging that an ALPS system be studied. Proposing a study is always easier, of course, than taking the political heat for actually doing something.    President Reagan's support for SDI has altered the West's strategic debate, but as a research program alone it risks being undermined as too visionary to be worth today's tax dollars. The Defense Science Board suggests a better course. </TEXT></DOC>
