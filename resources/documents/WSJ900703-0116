These are largely happy times for mostAmericans.   Yet other, less noble images lurk in the background of ourJuly 4th celebrations: the guards who patrol our 2,000-mileborder with Mexico or reports by government agencies that thenation's immigration law has indeed caused widespread hiringdiscrimination against non-whites. We read that SoutheastAsian nations and British officials in Hong Kong have warnedthe United States that they may no longer provide firstasylum for the flood of refugees that still flee fromVietnam.   The question for Independence Day is which symbolrepresents this country's attitude toward the modernequivalent of our desperate immigrant forbears -- the Statueof Liberty or the stiff arm of refusal and prejudice?   The law of our land is now the 1986 Immigration Reform andControl Act, which seeks to hound &quot;illegal&quot; immigrants andpersists in sending anyone who hires them to jail or finingthem. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service hadassessed millions of dollars in fines against employers underthis law. Four years ago today, we offered an alternative. Wewrote, &quot;If Washington still wants to `do something' aboutimmigration, we propose a five-word constitutional amendment:There shall be open borders.&quot;   We added, &quot;Perhaps this policy is overly ambitious intoday's world, but the U.S. became the world's envy bytrumpeting precisely this kind of heresy.&quot; A policy ofliberal borders is no more or less radical than the notionthat a democracy founded in a new, wild world could becomethe envy of all nations.   Without question, many free nations have done much thepast 15 years to absorb the world's refugees. But howevergrim and arduous this task, there can be no justification forabandoning it, and them. The price of freedom does not lieonly in defending it through force of arms but also inproving its worth by extending it to the unfree. What isrequired now when many are tired of helping the huddledmasses is leadership.   The consensus in Congress after the immigration law passedwas that it would be modified if it proved discriminatory.Instead, there has been talk of creating an improved personal&quot;document system,&quot; which sounds very much like a nationalidentity card. Some elected official -- Republican orDemocrat -- has to provide the leadership that will eliminatethe abuse of immigrants.   We have no illusions that this will be easy. There will beopposition. Backers of immigration limits are a coalitionbuilt on unattractive arguments. Nativists cast theiropposition to immigration in terms of protecting a culturalstatus quo. Some of them think legislation is needed to makeEnglish an official language, though surely the growth ofEnglish as an international language is likely to make suchparochial laws unnecessary. Limits-to-growth types, prevalentalong the coast between New York and Washington, say we'verun out of space.   Recall that when the Statue of Liberty was unveiled, anearlier generation of nativists had said that the Irishpouring into the U.S. would never assimilate. Their Englishwas, well, unEnglish. Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedyappear to have disproved these intensely held fears.   The past year has seen a number of works publishedallaying some of the most frequently heard criticisms andfears of the harm immigrants pose to U.S. society. GeorgeBorjas of the University of California at Santa Barbaracompiled &quot;Friends or Strangers: The Impact of Immigrants onthe U.S. Economy,&quot; and Julian Simon continued his research in&quot;The Economic Consequences of Immigration.&quot; The President'sEconomic Report this year advocated more liberal immigrationrestrictions, because of immigration's benefits.   Our support for more immigration isn't entirely for thebenefit of the immigrants alone. This nation needs therejuvenation that waves of new Americans bring. Latins,Vietnamese and West Indians are the new Irish, Italians andPoles. We must guard against slipping into the self-satisfiedview that we are good enough as is, no more need apply ortrespass on the American experiment.   The yearning masses offer us their talents, ambitions andobviously unbreakable spirit. In return, we acquire a renewedview of our own difficult past and, if we are true to thatpast, a reason for confidence in our future.</TEXT></DOC>
