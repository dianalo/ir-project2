Ironically, current moves to end the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, to be discussed at the U.S.-Soviet summit meeting this week, could prove a major blow to future aid to Pakistan.    The U.S. Congress is currently debating the Reagan administration's request for a six-year, $4.02 billion economic and military aid package for Pakistan, to, among other things, help Pakistan aid Afghan resistance fighters.    Under a law designed to limit the spread of nuclear weapons, Congress must grant Pakistan -- which has never signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty -- a waiver to allow it to receive any aid. A six-year waiver expired Sept. 30. The House of Representatives late last week refused to consider a move by Rep. Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.) that would have required the president to certify that Pakistan isn't enriching uranium beyond the 5% level required for electricity generation. Uranium enriched beyond 5% has little use but for nuclear weapons. The House has approved the full aid package without strings, but it is still under consideration by the Senate.    But Rep. Solarz plans to try again this week. And other congressmen are looking for additional assurances that Pakistan won't make a bomb. Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio) is expected to introduce a similar enrichment amendment in the Senate. Some congressmen have suggested granting the waiver, but for only one or two years, instead of six.    The Reagan administration has argued vigorously against any fresh restrictions on aid to Pakistan, saying that would send the wrong signal to Moscow just when Pakistan-backed Afghan guerrillas seem to have turned the tide in the Afghan war.    An end to that war, which is now being negotiated by the Soviets, the U.S., Pakistan and Afghan resistance fighters, would almost certainly result in a big cut in the amount of U.S. military aid, U.S. officials say. It would also remove a key weapon used by pro-Pakistan lobbyists. &quot;If the war ends, {the U.S.} focus would shift from Afghanistan to {Pakistan's} nuclear program,&quot; says Daniel Pipes, director of the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia. &quot;We've been biting our tongues on the nuclear issue.&quot;    Pakistan says it will do anything Congress wants on that issue -- provided India does the same. But India, which also hasn't signed the non-proliferation treaty, doesn't get much U.S. aid and hasn't come under similar congressional pressure.    &quot;If you really believe in non-proliferation, why single out Pakistan?&quot; asks Prime Minister Mohammed Khan Junejo. &quot;Why not India? Make the rules the same for both countries. We won't be singled out. We're going to take India with us on this one.&quot; Adds President Mohammed Ziaul-Haq: &quot;I grant them {Congress} concern over Pakistan's nuclear program. By all means follow the policy of non-proliferation, which Pakistan also supports. But you can't beat Pakistan while hugging India.&quot;    Congressional opponents of aid to Pakistan argue that the issue is more truth than fairness. Recent newspaper and magazine articles -- heatedly denied in Pakistan -- quoted President Zia and a top nuclear scientist as saying the country already had a bomb. U.S. intelligence sources believe Pakistan could make a weapon if it hasn't already done so, as well as being certain that Pakistan has enriched uranium well beyond 5%. Last summer a Pakistani national, Arshad Pervez, was arrested in Philadelphia and charged with trying to illegally export special steel that could be used to make a bomb.    &quot;Relations are very strained at the moment,&quot; says a Senate staff member. &quot;It goes beyond the details of the nuclear issue. The Pakistanis have made repeated promises which they've broken. How can you have a relationship with a country that out and out lies to you and treats things that are important to you contemptuously?&quot;    Beyond the charges and countercharges lie major strategic issues. Pakistan argues that any U.S. aid cutoff plays into Soviet hands. &quot;The Soviets smelled this possible aid cut, and knew it would create strong, anti-U.S. feeling in Pakistan,&quot; says a Pakistani diplomat. &quot;So they stopped a promising peace process {in Afghanistan} to see what Congress would do. This could drive Pakistan toward the Soviets at the same time U.S. policy in the {Persian} gulf is driving Iran to them.&quot;    He adds with a sigh: &quot;Pakistan's fortitude is great but Pakistan's resources can't sustain us forever against the Soviet Union. It would be a great tragedy if a policy that is now succeeding were to be reversed.&quot;    Pakistan also argues that any aid cutoff would be counterproductive on the nuclear issue. Says the diplomat: &quot;If Congress insists on its pound of flesh and stops the aid, they remove the only fig leaf that was stopping us going all the way and making a bomb. We'd no longer have any inhibitions.&quot;    A break in aid would also feed anti-U.S. feelings that longtime observers say aren't far from the surface, anyway. &quot;There is a lot of latent anti-Americanism here,&quot; says a British diplomat, &quot;because of U.S. support for Israel, because Pakistan feels betrayed over lack of U.S. support in the 1965 and 1971 wars against India, because some people wonder if the Afghan conflict is a Pakistani or really an American problem, and because Iran's depiction of the U.S. as the Great Satan finds some resonance here among {Moslem} fundamentalists.&quot;    He adds: &quot;They aren't going to crawl begging to the Congress for aid. But they expect the aid to come through. They figure few Senators will want to be known as the guys who cut off the Afghan rebels.&quot;    Counters Leonard Weiss, a policy aide to Sen. Glenn: &quot;Too much has been made of the link between aid to Pakistan and aid to the {Afghan} mujahadeen. They can't afford to cut off the mujahadeen, because they need the Soviets out and the refugees back home. Even if there's nothing we can do about Pakistan's nuclear program, we've got to worry about the credibility of our policy towards Brazil, Argentina and other pre-nuclear countries.&quot;    Another Senate staffer notes that the difference between Pakistan and India on nuclear problems is momentum. &quot;Yes, India has a bomb, but after their test in 1974 they put their program on hold, where it is today,&quot; he says. &quot;Pakistan's program, on the other hand, has been moving ahead. We want Pakistan to put their program on hold, too. They've probably got enough material for two or three bombs now, so why go for five or six? If India sees Pakistan's program moving ahead, they'll move ahead and make weapons.&quot;    Senate sources agree that even if moves to deny Pakistan aid fail this year, they are sure to be renewed under a new U.S. president.    A State Department official says the Reagan administration wants Pakistan &quot;to agree to some sort of restraint on their enrichment program, so the president can be sure they aren't doing what they say they aren't doing. The administration wants to both uphold the law and give them the money. But the ball is in Pakistan's court.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
