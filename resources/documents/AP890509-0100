However, some opposition members who contend police inflamerioters, called Tuesday in the National Assembly for the governmentto limit police use of tear gas.   Roh, on the other hand, ordered Cabinet ministers to use allgovernment and security force resources to clamp down on radicalstudents, dissidents and striking workers who resort to violence.   He accused them of plotting a leftist revolution to overthrowwhat he called South Korea's liberal democratic system.   Roh's warning came after six riot policemen were burned to deathand 10 others critically injured in a May 3 clash with radicalstudents in southern Pusan. It was the worst political violence inSouth Korea in recent years.   The incident prompted a nationwide call against politicalviolence, and the government swiftly arrested several radicalleaders.   Under mounting public pressure, the main radical NationalCouncil of Student Representatives last week renounced violence.The group said it would not use firebombs if authorities easecontrols on anti-government demonstrations.   On Tuesday, 6,600 students peacefully demonstrated at 21universities and colleges in Seoul and elsewhere. No clashes wasreported, police said.   At some schools, police said students even destroyed hundreds offirebombs before starting anti-government rallies or campus marches.   At a special session of the National Assembly on Tuesday, manyruling and opposition lawmakers supported proposals to banfirebombs, a main protest weapon.   But some opposition members objected. They claimed excessive useof tear gas has tended to aggravate violent protests.   The main opposition parties, which have condemned violentprotests, plan a major attack on the government during the session,based on charges Roh has failed to carry out promised democraticreforms.   Top opposition leaders Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung aredemanding the resignation of Roh's entire Cabinet to acceptresponsibility for the political unrest.   Roh told Tuesday's Cabinet meeting he will use police to endviolent strikes and protests.   ``We cannot allow indefinitely a situation in which somecampuses become hotbeds for training leftist revolutionary forcesand bases for producing firebombs and leftist revolution,'' Rohsaid.   Radical students and anti-government dissident groups havelittle support because of their violent tactics and extremepolitical views.</TEXT></DOC>
