Ross Johnson, who triggeredthe multibillion-dollar buyout battle for RJR Nabisco Inc., lastweek sold 60,000 shares of RJR stock for nearly $5.5 million,according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Tuesday.   The stock sale came about a week after RJR directors rejected thebuyout bid from a management investor group led by Johnson in favorof Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.'s record $24.53 billion takeoveroffer.   The one-page SEC filing said the 60,000 common shares hadbelonged to Johnson's wife, Laurie, but could be consideredbeneficially owned by him. They were sold in the open market on Dec.7 for $91 each, or $5.46 million, the filing said.   It was not immediately known how many RJR shares Johnson owns orhis profit from the latest sale.
