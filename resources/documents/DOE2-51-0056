The year to year drop was 5.4% in comparison with 1981and the two years drop since 1980 was 11.07%. Reevaluation of previouslydiscovered fields and new discoveries suggest the world recoverable reservesbeing about 670.2 billion bbl of oil and 3,025 Tcf of gas. The most importantcontribution to the future increase of conventional oil resources willbe improvements in production technology. Enhanced recovery may add reservesof medium grade heavy oil as would the rehabilitation of depleted fields.Consequently, with the exception of a few long term deep sea discoveries,it is believed that efforts at the dawn of the 21st Century should bedirected towards improvements in producing technology as opposed to dreamsof many new basins.</TEXT></DOC>
