Palo Verde said it won't contest the NRC's findings. &quot;We acknowledge the violations and will pay the civil penalty,&quot; said William F. Conway, executive vice president of Palo Verde, which is operated by the Arizona Public Service Co. utility unit of Phoenix-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. &quot;We have since instituted strict programs and standards to preclude recurrence of similar violations in the future.&quot;    The violations were found by an NRC inspection team following the shutdown of Palo Verde Unit 3 on March 3, during which several equipment malfunctions occurred. The violations included inadequate preventive and corrective actions on equipment in the steam system, for which a $100,000 penalty is proposed; inadequate training and certain operating procedure violations, for which a $50,000 penalty is proposed; and inadequate lighting and failures to inspect and test emergency lighting systems, for which a $100,000 penalty is proposed. </TEXT></DOC>
