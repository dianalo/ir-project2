Project Description</ITAG>Tennessee proposes to construct and operate facilities on its Niagara Spurand on its 200 mainline in order to transport Canadian natural as to theproposed Ocean State Power (Ocean State) and Ocean State Power II (OceanState II) electric generating plant units in Burrillville, Rhode Islandand to take delivery of Canadian gas for system supply.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ On November 19, 1986, Ocean State filed an applicationwith the ERA, under section 3 of the NGA, for authorization to import upto 100,000 Mcf per day of Canadian natural gas over a 20-year term beginningon the date of the first delivery. The imported gas would fuel Ocean State'snew power plant which it plans to build in Burrillville, Rhode Island.The plant will be comprised of two 250 megawatt combined cycle electricalgenerating units to be constructed sequentially.<ITAG tagnum="28">On June 13, 1988, the ERA issued DOE/ERA Opinion and Order No. 243(Order 243) in ERA Docket No. 86-62-NG (1 ERA Para. 70,778) conditionallyauthorizing Ocean State to import up to 100,000 Mcf per day of Canadiangas over a 20-year period. On September 14, 1988, after DOE's completionof its NEPA review, the ERA issued DOE/ERA Opinion and Order No. 243-A(1 ERA Para. 70,810), authorizing Ocean State to import up to 100,000 Mcfper day over a period of 20 years plus 180 days, beginning on the dateof first delivery. On April 21, 1989, Ocean State and Ocean State II fileda joint application with FE to amend order 243-A. According to the jointapplication, at the time Order 243-A was issued, Ocean State planned toconstruct, own, and operate both combined units. Ocean State currentlyplans to develop only the first unit, Unit 1, which will utilize 50,000Mcf of gas per day. To facilitate financing of the project, Ocean StateII was formed to develop the second unit, Unit 2.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">On September 22, 1989, FE issued DOE/ERA Opinion and Order No. 334(Order 334) which amended Paragraph A of Order 243-A by authorizing OceanState to import up to 50,000 Mcf per day of Canadian gas over a 20-yearperiod plus 180 days beginning on the date of first delivery. Additionally,on September 22, 1989, FE issued DOE/ERA Opinion and Order 335 (Order 335)which authorized Ocean State II to import up to a total of 50,000 Mcf ofCanadian gas over a 20-year period beginning on the date of first delivery.</ITAG>On December 18, 1986, Tennessee filed an application in FERC Docket No.CP87-132-000, as amended on August 31, 1987, in Docket No. CP87-132-001,under section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), requesting authorizationto provide a firm, long-term transportation service of 50,000 decathermsper day for Ocean State and to construct and operate compression and pipelinefacilities in order to perform that service.Additionally, on December 18, 1986, Tennessee filed an application in FERCDocket No. CP87-131-000, as amended on August 5, 1987, in Docket No. CP87-131-001under section 7(c) of the NGA, requesting authorization to construct andoperate compression facilities to increase the capacity of the NiagaraSpur in order to take delivery of authorized Canadian imports for Tennessee'ssystem supply. The compression would be added in two phases to accommodatethe building of the volumes.In Phase I, Tennessee proposed to operate on a permanent basis two idlecompressors: The 3,500 horsepower (hp) compressor at Station 233, LivingstonCounty, New York, along the 200 mainline and the 1,000 hp compressor atstation 230-B, East Aurora, New York, at the interconnection of the Spurand the 200 mainline.

Background</ITAG>On October 9, 1987, ERA issued DOE/ERA Opinion and Order 195 (Order 195)\9\<NOTE/> authorizing Tennessee to import from Canada up to 5,000 Mcfof natural gas per day during the period November 1, 1987, through October31, 1988. Order 195 conditionally authorized Tennessee to import up to29,000 Mcf of Canadian gas per day during the period November 1, 1988,through October 31, 1989, up to 79,700 Mcf of Canadian gas per day duringthe period November 1, 1989, through October 31, 1990, up to 125,000 Mcfper day thereafter through October 31, 2002. The gas would be purchasedfrom KannGaz Producers Ltd. (KannGaz) for Tennessee's system supply andwould be delivered to Tennessee through an existing interconnection withTransCanada PipeLines Limited (TransCanada) near Niagara Falls, New York.The first year import volumes could be imported by Tennessee through existingpipeine facilities. The ERA conditioned authorization for imports above5,000 Mcf per day on the issuance of a final ERA opinion and order afterreview by the DOE of FERC's environmental analysis and completion of theDOE's NEPA responsibilities in connection with the new facilities requiredfor the transportation of the additional authorized volumes.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ 1 ERA Para. 70,726. Order 195 was issued subsequent topublication by the ERA of a Notice of Application in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 25908, July 1987) and an unprotested proceedingin which 11 interventions were granted.In DOE/ERA Opinion and Order No. 195-A issued on July 15, 1988, in ERADocket No. 87-28-NG, the ERA authorized Tennessee to import from Canadaup to 5,000 Mcf of natural gas per day during the period November 1, 1987,through October 31, 1988, and up to 29,900 Mcf per day during the periodNovember 1, 1988, through October 31, 1989. Order 195-A reiterated Tennessee'sconditional authorization to import up to 79,700 Mcf of Canadian gas perday during the period November 1, 1989, through October 31, 1990 and upto 125,000 Mcf per day thereafter through October 31, 2002.The first and second-year import volumes could be imported by Tennesseethrough existing pipeline facilities. The ERA conditional authorizationfor imports above 29,900 Mcf per day as granted in Order 195-A, statedin ordering paragraph C that all other terms and conditions of Order 195remained in effect, requiring the issuance of a final ERA opinion and orderafter review by the DOE of the FEIS being prepared by the FERC, assessingthe impacts of the additional facilities proposed by Tennessee. These facilitieswould increase the pressure on Tennessee's Niagara Spur pipeline and northernNo. 200 mainline to enable it to receive the remaining import volumes fromKannGaz and move them from the Niagara Spur through the mainline. Subsequently,the review was completed, the FEIS was adopted by the DOE, and a finalauthorization approving the import was issued to Tennessee in Order 195-B.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Governmental Responsibilities</ITAG>For tennessee's proposed project, the issuance of several major permitsand authorizations are required. On May 22, 1987, Tennessee filed an applicationwith the ERA in Docket No. 87-28-NG for authorization under section 3 ofthe NGA to import gas from Canada to be used for system supply. The FERChas the responsibility under sections 3 and 7 of the NGA, respectively,to approve the place of entry of imports whenever the import involves theconstruction of new domestic facilities and to certificate the pipelinefacilities supplying the gas. Tennessee filed an application with the FERCon December 18, 1986, to construct and operate compression facilities toincrease the capacity of the Niagara Spur pipeline to take delivery ofthese imports.\10\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ FERC Docket No. CP87-131-000, as amended on August 5,1987, in Docket No. CP87-131-001 and Docket No. CP87-132-000, as amendedon August 31, 1987, in Docket No. CP87-132-001.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Description of Alternatives</ITAG>FE has two alternative courses of action in processing Tennessee's applicationto import natural gas. It may grant the application (with or without conditions)or deny the application (no action). If the application is granted, Tennesseemay proceed with the project as proposed, subject to any conditions imposedby FE and the FERC. If FE denied the application for importing gas to theNortheast U.S., Tennessee would need to look elsewhere for an alternativesupply of gas to meet the expected future requirements of its customersin the region. Tennessee may be required to construct additional pipelinefacilities in other locations to transport gas supplies from other sources.Failure to offset the projected supply deficiencies if alternative sourcesare not available could have an adverse impact on the economy of the Northeast,as well as diminish the quality of life.It is significant that regardless of whether Tennessee's increased importsare approved, the facility additions proposed on the Niagara Spur in NewYork would still take place because they are necessary to provide previouslyapproved Canadian gas imports to the Ocean State and Ocean State II electricgenerating facility units that will be built in Rhode Island. On September14, 1988, the ERA authorized the Ocean State imports.11<NOTE/> Although the Ocean State project and Tennesee's applicationare independent import projects, the two proposals are dependent on theexpansion by Tennessee of its Niagara Spur. The FERC, on October 3, 1988,granted a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing Tennesseeto construct and operate facilities on its Niagara Spur and on its mainlinein order to transport Canadian gas to the Ocean State plant and to takedelivery of gas for system supply.12<NOTE/> The environmental impacts associated with Tennessee's proposedimports and Ocean State's approved imports would be no different becausethey are tied to the same Niagara Spur expansion.13<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>11 1 ERA Para. 70,810.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>12 45 FERC Para. 61,010, rehearing granted in part and deniedin part, 45 FERC Para. 61,324, November 29, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>13 The enviromental effects associated with the Niagara Spurfacilities expansion were discussed in the ERA's Record of Decision forthe Ocean State project (53 FR 36483, September 20, 1988).If FE granted the application, Tennessee could proceed to import the Canadiangas subject to the construction of the facilities approved by the FERCto transport said gas.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Basis for Decision</ITAG>The principal criteria in choosing whether to approve or disapprove a gasimport is the requirement, under section 3 of the NGA, that an applicationto import gas must be approved unless, after opportunity for hearing, itis determined that the import is not consistent with the public interest.In addition, the environmental implications of granting or denying theimport application must be considered pursuant to NEPA.1. General Conclusions Orders 195,    195-A and 195-BFE is guided in making its determination by the DOE's natural gas importpolicy guidelines.14<NOTE/> Under this policy, the competitiveness of an import in themarkets served is the primary consideration for meeting the public interesttest. In the case of long-term arrangements such as this, need for thegas supply and security of supply are also important considerations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>14 49 FR 6684, February 22, 1984.FE concluded that the proposed import, which will be made under a market-responsivegas purchase contract containing a low take-or-pay obligation, price adjustmentand periodic review provisions, meets the DOE guidelines concerning competitiveness,need for the supply, and security of supply, and is consistent with thepublic interest. In addition, it was determined that the import authorizationwould have limited environmental impacts and would be environmentally acceptable.2. Environmental DeterminationThe FERC was the lead Federal agency in conducting an examiniation of theenvironmental effects of Tennessee's additional Niagara Spur facilitiesand in preparing the FEIS. Since both projects involve common facilities,the Ocean State FEIS addressed the environmental impacts of the transmissionfacilities proposed by Tennessee, as well as the new powerplant and ancillaryfacilities proposed by Ocean State. However, this Record of Decision dealssolely with Tennesee's facilities. The DOE participated as a cooperatingagency during the preparation of the FEIS, and utilized the FEIS (whichwas adopted as a DOE EIS) as well as an independent evaluation in assessingthe environmental effects of granting or denying Tennessee's import authorization.<ITAG tagnum="21">As stated in the FEIS ``* * * generally, construction of pipelineloops parallel with, and adjacent to, existing pipelines is environmentallypreferable. Parallel construction takes advantage of available clearedright-of-way during construction of the loop. This prevents the establishmentof new pipeline corridors and minimizes the amount of required clearing.Preferable alternatives to paralleling an existing pipeline route musthave significant environmental advantages over a parallel route, must bepracticable to construct from an economic and engineering standpoint, andshould pose no long-term operation or maintenance problems.'' 15<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>15 Page 2-193, DOE/EIS-0140.The proposed modification to Tennessee's pipeline and its associated compressorfacilities will be performed at various locations along the pipeline route.As the following discusson demonstrates, the compressor station changesproposed are the environmentally preferable construction alternative becausethey involve the least amount of environmental change to the affected areas.The FEIS evaluated the following proposals by Tennessee for facilitiesto expand capacity on its Niagara Spur pipeline and No. 200 mainline toenable it to accommodate the scheduled buildup of contract volumes to beimported from KannGaz: (1) Expand measurement and odorization facilitiesat the Lewiston Meter Station at the Niagara River in Niagara County, NewYork; (2) convert from temporary to permanent operation the 3,500-hp gascompressor at Station 233 on Tennessee's mainline in Livingston County,New York; (3) convert from temporary to permanent operation the 1,000-hpgas compressor at Station 230B on Tennessee's mainline in East Aurora,New York, at the interconnection of the Niagara Spur and the mainline andadd 1,200 hp of compression; and (4) construct a new 4,500-hp gas compressorstation 230C at Lockport, in Niagara County, New York.The impacts from modifying the Lewiston Meter Station are anticipated tobe minimal. No additional buildings would be erected, and work would beconfined to Tennesee's existing property. Aquatic and terrestrial ecologicalimpacts are not anticipated, since no additional structures are proposedby Tennessee.Compressor Station 233 would have only minimal impacts from constructionand operation. No additional land is required for increasing the horsepowerand there would be no effect on the cultural resources.Compressor Station 230B is located in a rural residential area. Improvementsto the station would be contained within land which is zoned industrialand is already owned by Tennesee. The station is bordered on one side bya park, but a 60-foot hill between the park and the site will shield thepark from the compressor station. A trailer park also abuts the site. Accessto the compressor station is along the road next to the trailer park. Trafficnoise is expected to impact the park as equipment is moved in and out.There would be no effect on cultural resources.Proposed Compressor Station 230C would be a new use for a currently cultivatedparcel of land. It will be located near a residential and industrial area.Although construction traffic is expected to add to the traffic commutingto the nearby General Motors plant, the impacts are expected to be minimal.Upgrading of existing compressor stations and construction of new compressorfacilities are not expected to affect the aquatic environment since nostreams are affected. None of the compressor stations would be considereda major source of air pollution and the impact on ambient air quality wouldnot be significant. The construction and permanent operation of the gas compression facilitieswould result in increases in ambient sound levels at these locations. Asidefrom some temporary noise due to construction, the permanent operationof the compressors may result in an annoyance to nearby residents. Tennesseehas agreed to a FERC staff recommendation that its proposed compressoradditions would not produce a day-night sound level (L<T2>dn</T2>) of 555 decibels on the A-weighted scale (dBA) at the nearestnoise-sensitive receptor, such as a residence or hospital. This can beachieved by installing mufflers, barriers, and other noise-suppressiondevices on the compressors. The FEIS concluded that no significant environmental impacts would occuras a result of the proposed upgrades to Tennessee's existing gas compressorstations and construction of the new gas compressor station. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Considerations in Implementing the Decision </ITAG>In the FEIS, the FERC staff specified only one mitigation measure whichit considered appropriate for the construction and operation of the compressorstations. The FERC staff determined that if the compressors are designedto minimize noise levels, minimal environmental impacts would occur fromthe proposed compressor station additions. We note that the certificateauthorizing Tennessee to construct and operate the facilities to transportgas for Ocean State and its system supply volumes was granted on the conditionthat Tennessee, among other things, implement the mitigation measure identifiedas No. 18, on page 5-32 of the Ocean State FEIS, which called for the proposedcompressor station additions to be designed such that operational compressornoise shall not exceed L<T2>dn</T2> of 55 dBA at any existing noise-sensitive areas nearby.\1\\6\<NOTE/> After construction is completed, Tennessee is required tosubmit to the FERC sound level surveys to verify that these performancegoals have been achieved. Tennessee has agreed to the noise emission limitations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ <T3>See supra </T3>note 8. <ITAG tagnum="84">IX. No-Action Alternative </ITAG>As stated in Paragraph VI, Description of Alternatives, regardless of whetherTennessee's increased imports are approved, the facility additions proposedon the Niagara Spur in New York, would still take place because they arenecessary to provide previously approved Canadian gas imports to OceanState and Ocean State II. On September 14, 1988, the ERA authorized theOcean State imports. Although the Ocean State project and Tennessee's application are independentimport projects, the two proposals are dependent on the expansion by Tennesseeof its Niagara Spur. The FERC, on October 3, 1988, granted a certificateof public convenience and necessity authorizing Tennessee to constructand operate facilities on its Niagara Spur and on its mainline in orderto transport Canadian gas to the Ocean State plant and to take deliveryof gas for system supply. The environmental impacts associated with Tennessee'sproposed imports and Ocean State's approved imports would be no differentbecause they are tied to the same Niagara Spur expansion. <ITAG tagnum="84">X. Conclusion </ITAG>The decision whether to authorize Tennessee to import the conditioned volumesof natural gas has been evaluated against the potential environmental impacts.Implementing the specific mitigation measure identified in the FEIS wouldminimize the social, economic, and environmental effects and promote thepositive effects of the requested import project. These additional importvolumes significantly would enhance Tennessee's ability to meet the futuresupply requirements of its customers. The proposed facilities representthe environmentally preferable construction alternative. The FEIS identifiesno significant environmental impacts resulting from the Tennessee constructionproposals. Authorizing the increased volumes would have no environmentalimpact since the facilities would be built regardless of DOE's decision.Accordingly, FE has decided to grant Tennessee authority to import thefull scheduled contract volumes of Canadian gas under its arrangement withKannGaz and determined that this decision is not inconsistent with thepublic interest under section 3 of the NGA. <ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, on October 31, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance L.
