Higher resolution-400 dpi-and some new packagingstrategies.andP;  For the first time ever, Microsoft sells its mouse a la cartefor $125, which means you should be able to buy it for less than $100 on thestreet.andP;  Bundled with PC Paintbrush (by Z-Soft Corp.), it costs $150.andP;  With afull version of Microsoft Windows 3.0, you'll see a list price of $225.andO;(Microsoft no longer sells it with a runtime version of Windows 286.) Themouse is available in serial, PS/2, InPort, and bus versions.andM;The mouse comes with two versions of Microsoft's mouse driver, Version 7.0:MOUSE.SYS for installation through CONFIG.SYS, and MOUSE.COM for installationfrom the command line.andP;  There is also support for OS/2.andM;CPANEL.EXE provides configuration support for both linear and ballistictracking, covering the range from very fast to very slow.andP;  (Ballistic controlcan be turned off.) CPANEL is invoked from the command line by simplypressing Ctrl-Shift and the left mouse button.andP;  Rounding out the software isa copy of Microsoft PaintBrush or Microsoft Windows, and a little game calledBOA, which sends a snake after the mouse pointer.andM;The ball is slightly forward from the mouse's center, and provides goodtraction on the desk.andP;  With ballistic control turned on, it is possible tocover the entire screen by using about I square inch of disk space.andO;Ballistic control takes a good bit of getting used to, and with both linearand ballistic settings set very high, the cursor is almost impossible tocontrol.andM;For absolute compatability, comfortable design, and top-notch quality, you'llfind the Miscrosoft Mouse, no matter what package you purchase it in, isworth every penny.andP;  Microsoft Mouse Microsoft Corp., 1 Microsoft Way,Redmond, WA 98052; (206) 882-8080.andP;  List Price: $125, with MicrosoftPaintbrush, $150; with Microsoft Windows 3.0,$225.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
