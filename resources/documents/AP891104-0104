(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The 10th anniversary of the seizure ofthe U.S. Embassy in Tehran brings bitter memories to Joseph Subic,the only military hostage rejected for a decoration after 444 daysin captivity.   The Army says the former non-commissioned officer appeared in afilm criticizing the U.S role in Iran, and, when tortured,disclosed facts about other hostages.   Subic, 33, now a law enforcement officer for Florida'sDepartment of Agriculture, strongly disagrees with the Army'sreasoning in not awarding him the Defense Meritorious Service Medal.   He said he told his captors only what they already knew byperusing the numerous undestroyed files left in the embassy. All hedid, he says, is confirm his signature on specific documents _ andhe notes he received an honorable discharge.   ``If I'm bitter or not is immaterial, Iran is in the past. Ilive for the present,'' he said in an interview in Saturday'sSun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale. ``You never forget those 444 days.But you accept them.''   Subic thinks he was a scapegoat. He does not turn away from whathe did because he thinks there is no need to. He said he simplyobeyed the Iranian radicals who took him prisoner.   ``I read whatever they asked me to. I have no idea what itsaid,'' said Subic.   He did it, he said, ``Because death was always there. So was theisolation.''   On Nov. 4, 1979, six months after he arrived in Iran and armedwith a shotgun and a 9mm pistol, Subic was informed the chancelleryof the embassy had been breached. He was the first military personto have armed contact with the Iranians.   ``I would have shot but it was a question of whether deadlyforce was necessary. They led with women in front of them. To shootunarmed people was wrong. We had standards to maintain.   ``We thought we'd be kept 20 or 30 minutes and the governmentwould come and retake the embassy.''   They were wrong. After destroying many sensitive documents, theysurrendered, were handcuffed, and were lined up against a window.   ``They then put guns to the back of our heads and we heard ametallic click,'' he recalled.   But Subic said he was unafraid.   ``On the day of the takeover, I had no fear of dying because Iwas defending the embassy and doing my job. After that, I began towonder, `What am I going to die for?'''   The sergeant _ at 23, he was already a six-year Army veteran _believed in his country and in its president.   When he returned to this country in 1980, he still did. But ithad been a long 444 days.   ``I don't know if I lost faith. But I wondered, where is mycountry? I was not disillusioned by America; I was disillusionedthat we didn't receive the proper training, that they didn'tunderstand the magnitude of the situation,'' he said.   During those days, Subic read the Bible because there wasnothing else to read, he says. He read it completely throughseveral times. He read high school textbooks. He found out the shahof Iran was dead by reading The Sporting News. He found out aboutyellow ribbons that way, too.   ``We couldn't understand yellow ribbons.''   Without bitterness, he says: ``What were yellow ribbons going todo for us? We wanted to see B-52s.''   He tried escaping once.   ``At least, then, I would know what would happen. I tied sheetstogether and went. I made it 200 yards. I got beat up, I sucked a.45. They tied me up with electrical wire and kept me awake fordays.   ``But I don't really equate the physical torture so much whencompared to the mental torture. They'd come in with hoods overtheir heads. They'd handcuff you, put you against a wall and put agun to your head. Your knees would buckle and they'd laugh.''   Still, the young man from Redford Township, Mich., says it washis job and he did it.   He knows some of the other 51 hostages, the ones with whom hebriefly shared an entire world inside a single room. Today, theyexchange Christmas cards.   ``I have my new life to live,'' Subic said.   He does not question what the military decided to do about hismedal. He says that life is too short, that he is no loser, that hehas proved that. And that in the future, others will realize that.   ``Someday I'll be able to hold up my medal. I haven't doneanything wrong.''</TEXT></DOC>
