He argued that the state's new evidence waseither unrelated or irrelevant to the present charges and that introducing itwould amount to trying Mandela for crimes for which she had not beenindicted.;    But Swanepoel managed to air the evidence in court anyway bysubmitting a document in which he outlined the new evidence against Mandela.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Johannesburg, South Africa  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910319  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  300  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday March 19, 199100079138,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
