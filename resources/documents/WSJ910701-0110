But don't look for the current spat to escalate into anall-out row, observers say. The two sides need each other toomuch to terminate their decades-old marriage of convenience.</LP><TEXT>   Officials on both sides acknowledge that disclosures ofwidespread wrongdoing at the brokerage firms have securitiesexecutives and ministry officials bickering with each otherlike never before.   &quot;We've been angry {with the securities firms} many timesbefore,&quot; says one ministry official. &quot;But this time issomewhat different. The degree of misconduct is much moreserious.&quot;   The ministry's displeasure broke into the open last weekafter a series of statements by Yoshihisa Tabuchi, NomuraSecurities Co.'s former president. Speaking at the company'sannual meeting Thursday, Mr. Tabuchi, who announced hisresignation only days earlier to deflect growing criticism ofthe firm, said Nomura had acted &quot;in consultation with theMinistry of Finance&quot; when it paid compensation of more than$114 million to wealthy clients who suffered stock losseslast year. He disputed critics who suggested that thepayments were improper.   Hours later, Nomura's new president, Hideo Sakamaki,issued an apology for his predecessor's remarks. Still, theministry was not amused. At a news conference the nextmorning, Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto denied that theministry knew of the payments in advance and criticized Mr.Tabuchi for not taking his firm's transgressions moreseriously.   Later in the day, Mr. Hashimoto suggested the governmentmight put tighter controls on brokerage firm involvement ininvesting public pension funds and spoke in favor of amendingJapanese law to forbid compensatory payments to clients.   Ministry officials may be contemplating further measuresto discipline the brokerage firms as well. Over the weekend,the Japanese press reported that the ministry plans to orderNomura and No. 3-ranked Nikko Securities Co. to &quot;voluntarily&quot;refrain from doing business for an unspecified period laterin the year. The reports, which couldn't be confirmed, alsosaid the ministry will insist that the firms tighten in-housesupervisory systems.   The ministry plans to crack down on the firms aspunishment for the improper rebates and for their ties toSusumu Ishii, former leader of an organized crime syndicate,according to the reports. The Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan'sbiggest newspapers, has alleged that Nomura also manipulatedthe stock price of a large railway concern on behalf of Mr.Ishii.   Despite their &quot;get tough&quot; stance, ministry officials knowthey can't afford to impose sanctions that would alienate theBig Four. Privately they admit they are dependent on thecooperation of the Big Four to regulate the market as awhole.   In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission ridesherd over Wall Street with a staff of 2,000, many of whom arelawyers with special training and years of experience. InJapan, the Finance Ministry's securities division strugglesunder the same mandate, but with a staff of only 160 people.   For their part, the brokerage houses recognize that theyneed the good will of the bureaucrats too. Even as Mr.Tabuchi and Mr. Hashimoto sparred last week, officials at theJapan Securities Dealers Association mounted a campaign todraft a former Finance Ministry official as their president.Typically the organization has been headed by a chairman fromone of the Big Four securities houses. Observers said themove is an effort to repair ties between the regulators andthe brokers.   Even if that effort is successful, the relationship faceschallenges as new reports of misconduct continue to surface.To date the Big Four brokerage firms have confessed to payingcompensation totaling nearly $500 million to favored clientswho lost money on stock investments in the year ended March31, 1990. On Saturday, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan'sleading financial daily, reported that the Big Four paid anadditional 5.1 billion yen ($36 million) to clients for,among other things, investment losses since April 1, 1990.Officials at the securities companies couldn't be reached forcomment on the reports.</TEXT></DOC>
