The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said it was taking the action to reduce bureaucratic delays stemming from last year's scandal over illegal sales of milling equipment to the Soviet Union by a Toshiba Corp. affiliate.    The equipment allowed the Soviets to improve the stealth of their nuclear submarines. The U.S. uproar over the disclosure sparked hasty Japanese efforts to beef up enforcement mechanisms mandated by the Paris-based Coordinating Committee for Export Control.    A MITI official said tomorrow's list will identify 19 acceptable products or technological goods for export to East bloc countries. These will include word processors, transistors, certain laser devices, advanced tabulation machines and frequency analyzers, he said.    The agency has issued such lists previously, but only sporadically.    In January, the Cocom members -- the U.S., its 14 North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies and Japan -- agreed in the wake of the Toshiba affair to strengthen and streamline controls on exports to the East bloc. The accord included a decision to reduce the number of items on export-control lists and to spend more time and money policing the exports that remain. </TEXT></DOC>
