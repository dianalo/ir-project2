Takeshita pledged Tuesday to resign after Parliament passes thebudget to take responsibility for the scandal, which involvesinfluence-peddling and questionable stock dealings among seniorgovernment officials.   The Liberal Democratic Party was expected to ram the budgetthrough Parliament later Thursday. The opposition is boycotting thesession, demanding new elections and that former Premier YasuhiroNakasone be summoned to the assembly to testify about his role inthe scandal.   The Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, Japan'spowerful Lower House, took about two minutes to approve the budget.   There still was no clear successor to Takeshita, since manysenior party leaders are linked to the scandal. Former ForeignMinister Masayoshi Ito, 75, widely viewed as the top candidate forinterim premier because he is untouched by the scandal, expressedreluctance again Thursday due to poor health.   On Wednesday Takeshita met with Shintaro Abe, secretary generalof the governing party, and the two agreed to decide on a successorafter Japan's April 29-May 6 ``Golden Week'' holidays.   The normally unflappable prime minister appeared shakenfollowing the suicide Wednesday of Ihei Aoki, 58, an aide since1958 and the man who handled Takeshita's scandal-tainted politicaldonations.   ``I strongly regret (his action),'' Takeshita told reporters.``We walked side by side for over 30 years.''   Aoki, who had served Takeshita since 1958, was found deadWednesday in his Tokyo apartment. Police said he had slashed awrist and an ankle with a razor and hanged himself after leavingnotes to his wife and several other people, including Takeshita.Police declined to reveal the notes' contents.   Takeshita said he had not seen Aoki's note, but thought it waspossible the suicide was linked to the stock-profiteering andbribery scandal.   Aoki's name, not Takeshita's, appeared on loans and sharedealings with the Recruit Co. that are under suspicion both forpolitical ethics and bribery. The company, an information servicesconglomerate, is accused of trying to buy influence withpoliticians, bureaucrats, business leaders and media executives.   Author Yotaro Konaka, a government critic, said, ``Mr. Aoki hadused all his might to protect Prime Minister Takeshita by puttingall blame on himself, and he probably made his choice (to die)after losing the object to protect when the prime ministerresigned.''   Tetsuro Muroboshi, who has written books on a number ofcorruption scandals, said he could not the motive wasresponsibility for Takeshita's fall.   ``I suspect Mr. Aoki was cornered by something _ something hecould escape from only by ending his own life,'' Muroboshi said.   Takeshita announced his resignation plan after disclosures overthe weekend that Aoki had accepted a $384,000 loan from Recruit.   Takeshita told Parliament on April 11 that he had received morethan $1 million in political donations from Recruit, but he did notmention the loan. He told reporters later he had not known about it.   Aoki's name also was on opposition parties' list of 154influential people who earned handsome profits after buyingbargain-price stock in a Recruit subsidiary before it was offeredfor public sale. Takeshita denied personal involvement in the stockdeal.   Prosecutors had questioned Aoki several times. Fourteenbureaucrats and businessmen _ but no politicians _ have beenarrested on bribery and securities law violation charges in thecase.   The wide swath of Recruit's donations, loans and sharetransactions cut through the political leadership have made itdifficult for the Liberal Democrats to find a replacement forTakeshita.   Ito's age and health _ he is a diabetic _ make most observersconsider him an interim choice who would serve for a few monthswhile the party chooses a longer-term leader. The head of theLiberal Democrats becomes prime minster because of the party's bigmajority in Parliament.   ``When the time is right, he will announce his acceptance,''Keichiro Nakamura, a aide to former Prime Minister Miki, told TheAssociated Press.   Nakamura called Ito's acsencion ``certain'' and said his cleanreputation will boost the Liberal Democrats' ailing image.   Hideo Sato, dean of the University of Tsukuba's College ofInternational Relations, agreed.   ``I think we need exactly that kind of person,'' Sato said. ``Heis apparently not involved in big money-making connections withbusiness, and lives in a modest home.''   Ito served as acting prime minister briefly after Prime MinisterMasayoshi Ohira died in June 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
