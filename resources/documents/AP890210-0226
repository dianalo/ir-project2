(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A hardware store sold its entirestock of AK-47 semiautomatic assault rifles and has about 150special orders to fill after it advertised a``get'em-before-you-can't'' sale this week.   ``I guess you can say sales increased,'' said Rob McCarthy, aclerk at Blair's True Value Hardware store who works at the guncounter.   McCarthy said Friday the store had sold all 15 of the AK-47s instock and had put in special orders for many more since placing afour-inch classified advertisement in a Milwaukee newspaper Sunday.Menomonee Falls is about 15 miles northwest of Milwaukee.   The weapon has received increased attention since Jan. 17 when agunman opened fire with an AK-47 on 400 children in a Stockton,Calif., playground, killing five children and injuring 29 others anda teacher.   Store owner Jim Blair said there was no connection between thatshooting and the sale although his store had benefitted from therecent news media attention the gun has received.   ``The day the ad was placed in the paper, we had a poor response.But since then there's been a lot of interest by the news media andsales have picked up,'' he said. Two local television stationscarried stories on the sale.   The advertisement offers one assault rifle, a cleaning kit and abayonet for $350. It also offers a ``buddy package deal'' in whichtwo people can buy two guns and 1100 rounds of ammunition for $790.   State Rep. David Travis criticized the store for using scaretactics to boost its sales, saying the store had played uponunwarranted fears that the gun will soon be outlawed.   No bills restricting purchases of assault rifles are pending inthe state Legislature, but Congress is considered legislation thatwould ban AK-47s, Uzis and other military-style, semiautomaticrifles. On Friday, police urged Congress to pass the bill.   Wisconsin law requires a 48-hour waiting period before thepurchase of a handgun is completed, but there is no wait to buy anassault rifle such as the AK-47 because they are classified as ahunting rifle.   Federal law requires anyone buying a gun to fill out a formasserting that he or she is not a convicted criminal, is notmentally ill and has not been dishonerably discharged from themilitary.   Travis said sales like the one by Blair's Hardware have hurt anyattempts to keep AK-47s off the street since the California shooting.   ``I think the damage is already done if we're having `blue-light'specials in Wisconsin on the sales of these guns,'' Travis said.   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Strohl of Racine, who hassupported stricter regulation of handguns, blamed the news media forgiving too much attention to the AK-47 and thus creating a hysteriato buy the gun.   ``I think what has happened is once people discuss this and askquestions about the control and use of these assault rifles, personsstart saying `I better go out and get one before it's too late,'''Strohl said.</TEXT></DOC>
