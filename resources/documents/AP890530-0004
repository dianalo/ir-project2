Their formal approval will come today in the communique the NATOleaders will issue after concluding the two-day, 40th anniversarysummit of the 16-nation military alliance.   But the sweeping Bush proposal, clearly aimed at seizing thearms control initiative from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev,was greeted at Monday's opening session by unanimous praise.   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a staunch U.S. ally,said the offer had ``transformed the summit,'' which had beenovershadowed by a nagging dispute over the future role ofshort-range nuclear arms in Europe.   NATO foreign ministers early today arrived at compromiselanguage to solve that dispute.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called Bush's initiative a``farsighted step'' that ``impressively affirmed the United States'leadership.''   ``President Bush has today paved the way for further success ofour alliance,'' Kohl told his colleagues.   The Western leaders have been dogged in recent weeks by a fighttouched off by a German demand for NATO to enter into early talkswith the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact on reducing short-range nucleararms in Europe.   The United States and Britain had opposed immediate bargainingon those weapons, arguing that the alliance should first focus itsattention on slashing conventional, or non-nuclear, arms in Europe.   The compromise formula worked out by the foreign ministers in apost-midnight skull session links the start of short-range missiletalks to completion of a conventional arms treaty. It alsostipulates that no nuclear missiles would be pulled out until theconventional reductions were completed.   Even before the ministers fashioned their negotiating strategy,European officials said the Bush troop initiative had made iteasier to resolve the missile dispute.   ``The sting is out of the problem,'' said Dutch Prime MinisterRuud Lubbers. ``It is not of the same urgency any more.''   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney urged the other allies toback the Bush proposals and turn them over to NATO experts to fleshout over the next 60 to 90 days.   The plans would then be put down on the negotiating table at theconventional arms talks between NATO and the seven-nation WarsawPact. The bargaining, which began in early March in Vienna, coversan area spanning the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains in theSoviet Union.   Spanish Foreign Minister Franciso Fernandez Ordonez said Bushhad given a fresh push to those discussions.   ``This proposal,'' he said, ``would reduce the possibility of asurprise attack by the Warsaw Pact.''   A senior administration official, briefing reporters under cloakof anonymity, said the response was ``even warmer than anything wehad reason to expect.''   In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass said the American offercame from a Bush administration ``under serious criticism from thepublic for the lack of any disarmament initiatives at a time whenthe Soviet Union has launched a `peace offensive.''   Bush called for Washington and Moscow to agree to trim theirtroops stationed in Europe to 275,000 on each side.   This would amount to a 20 percent cut in U.S. combat troops inEurope, reducing overall U.S. troop strength by about 10 percent.There are about 150,000 U.S. combat troops in Europe and more than150,000 support personnel.   The Soviets have an estimated 625,000 troops in Eastern andCentral Europe. Gorbachev has already offered to cut to 350,000 andproposed equal ceilings of NATO and Warsaw Pact forces of 1.35million.   Bush also called on the Kremlin to make good on a recentGorbachev proposal to set ceilings on conventional arms: 20,000tanks, 28,000 armored troop carriers and 16,500 to 24,000 artillerypieces, the precise number depending on how those weapons aredefined.   According to NATO, the West has 16,424 main battle tanks and theWarsaw Pact has 51,500 heavy tanks, with announced cuts to reducethat number to 39,500.   The president also pressed for reductions in combat airplanesand helicopters to levels 15 percent below the current NATO levels,or about 5,440 for each side.   All equipment that was pulled back would be destroyed.   The French and the British, Western Europe's only nuclearpowers, immediately said they would resist any attempt to includetheir dual-capable aircraft _ which can fire both conventional andnuclear weapons _ in the Bush arms plan.</TEXT></DOC>
