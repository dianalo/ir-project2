The Canadian Letter Carriers Union launched the action as a first step in its plan for rotating strikes across the country. A union spokesman said that &quot;if we need more pressure,&quot; there will be strikes in more cities today.    Negotiations for a new contract between the union and Canada Post Corp., the government-owned postal service, continued in Ottawa. A union spokesman said the two sides remained far apart. The contract between the union's 20,000 members and the company expired Dec. 31.    Police were called to at least one Montreal mail distribution center to allow delivery trucks to cross picket lines, and one striker was arrested for blocking the trucks' way.    Canada Post has promised to keep the mail moving during the strike. Montreal-based Dominion Textile Inc. said the company's truck was able to pick up mail at a downtown distribution center on its second attempt. But a half-dozen calls to smaller businesses and homes in Montreal showed none had received mail yesterday. In cities other than Montreal and Calgary, mail delivery was normal, but it's expected to fall off as many Canadians stop using the mail service because of uncertainties over the strike.    Unresolved issues in negotiations include job security, work rules, and the company's two-tier wage proposal, with lower salaries for new hires.    Canada Post placed job advertisements in major Canadian daily newspapers offering delivery people 13.25 Canadian dollars ($9.89) an hour. A spokesman for Canada Post said the company is compiling a list of people available for work on a standby basis. Members of the Letter Carriers union currently earn 13.43 dollars ($10.02) an hour.    The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which supports the government's efforts to keep the mail moving, says most Canadians do, too. The small-business trade group says that in a Gallup poll it commissioned, 72.5% of Canadian households favored hiring temporary help to keep mail service operating, and 55% of households with at least one union member favored such action.    Several government departments and many businesses have informed clients of contingency plans for essential communications. </TEXT></DOC>
