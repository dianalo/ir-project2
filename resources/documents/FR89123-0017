One commenter stated that the proposed definitionsof ``evacuation'' and ``transient accommodations'' imply that the costsof transient accommodations in the context of evacuations will not be eligiblefor reimbursement. The commenter also stated that reimbursement to individuals,local governments, and states for costs they incur during an evacuationshould be eligible.  ``Evacuation'' means the emergency relocation of threatened individualsfrom an area. Evacuation activities are carried out by State and localgovernments pursuant to their public health and safety responsibilities.Evacuation costs incurred by individuals and State and local governmentswill not be eligible for reimbursement under these regulations becauseevacuation activities are uniquely State and local governmental responsibilities.However, section 123(a) of the Superfund Amendments and Authorization Actof 1986, Pub. L. 99-499 (SARA) states: ``Any general purpose unit of localgovernment for a political subdivision which is affected by a release orthreatened release at any facility may apply to the President for reimbursementunder this section.'' Executive Order 12580 delegates the responsibilityfor implementation of section 123 to EPA and is therefore not addressedby FEMA.  ``Transient accommodations'' means hotels, motels, or similar accommodationswhich are used to assist eligible applicants who require temporary housingfor a short period of time_usually up to 30 days. When it is determinedby the lead agency that temporary relocation assistance is needed onlyfor a short period of time, transient accommodations are used. Transientaccommodation expenses will be reimbursed pursuant to these regulations. At the time these proposed regulations were published in 1986, the SuperfundAmendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 had not been enacted, and ExecutiveOrder 12580 has not been issued by the President. The previous ExecutiveOrder 12316 had delegated the responsibility for determining the need fortemporary relocation to FEMA. FEMA had found it necessary to redelegatethis responsibility to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ExecutiveOrder 12580 makes it unnecessary for FEMA to redelegate this responsibilityto EPA, because that Executive Order delegates the responsibility directlyto the EPA.  The lead agency notifies FEMA of the need to provide temporary relocationassistance. An interagency agreement (IAG) is signed by the lead agencyand FEMA. In addition to EPA, the lead agency may be United States CoastGuard (USCG), Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Energy (DOE),Department of Interior (DOI), or other federal agencies. The IAG providesfunds to FEMA to provide temporary relocation assistance, outlines thescope of work, and identifies eligible applicants for temporary relocationassistance.  One commenter requested that a definition of ``occupancy'' be included.The definition of an ``occupant'' is already addressed in the regulation.Therefore, further clarification is unnecessary.  Comments were received regarding how much FEMA will pay when the applicantelects to share accommodations with family and friends. Sharing of accommodationswith family and friends is an appropriate method of assistance under transitaccommodations. This type of assistance must be chosen by the applicant.FEMA has updated its Temporary Relocation Assistance Manual, which outlinesthe procedures for providing a subsistence payment to eligible applicantsplaced in transient accommodations. The subsistence payment provides fundsfor food and incidentals which are beyond or in addition to the livingcosts that the applicant would have incurred in their normal living arrangement.When FEMA administers the program, the payment will be based on FEMA Manual6200.1, Travel Regulations.  A commenter asked if the moving of mobile homes to commercial parks andback to the original sites as part of a temporary relocation response actionwould be an eligible expense. The commenter felt that this could be accomplishedat a lower cost than could other forms of temporary housing. However, movingmobile homes in a temporary relocation cannot be addressed as general policyfor several reasons: (1) The appropriate agency would have to determineif the mobile home was contaminated; (2) while some states classify mobilehomes as real property, others classify mobile homes as personal property(and moving real property in a temporary relocation is not an eligiblecategory of assistance); and (3) additional mobile home sites may not beavailable nearby, and the construction of new sites would be very costlyand unnecessary for a temporary relocation project. For these reasons,the mobile home issue will continue to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.However, under certain circumstances such costs might be eligible.  A commenter asked for a definition of ``basic minimum costs'' for utilitiesand whether these include gas or electricity in the winter to keep plumbingfrom freezing. ``Basic minimum costs'' is not an accepted phrase in thetemporary relocation assistance program. In temporary relocation, FEMArefers to ``essential utilities.'' ``Essential utilities'' are definedas gas, electricity, oil, water, sewer, and telephone. Costs for ``essentialutilities'' at the primary residence, during the period of temporary relocation,may be authorized since these costs are in addition to the cost for utilitiesat the temporary residence.Costs for utilities at the temporary residence are the responsibility ofthe occupant. If cost effective, winterization costs may be paid as analternative to, or in conjunction with, the utility subsidy. For example,at one relocation site, the plumbing was drained and winterized to preventdamage to plumbing fixtures. The degree of winterization is not defined,as it would vary with different sections of the country. When evaluatingthe different methods of winterization, cost effectiveness is an importantconsideration.A commenter stated that the use of a home located in the floodplain isnot an issue in temporary relocation. In the temporary relocation program,FEMA has exempted temporary relocation assistance from the requirementsof Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands, 44 CFR Part 9. However,every effort shall be made to place families in existing resources withincommunities participating in the National Flood Insurance Program. Acquiringthe appropriate flood insurance coverage is the responsibility of the homeowner.The same commenter felt that site security is the responsibility of theEPA. The FEMA/EPA Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is currently beingrevised and will state that site security is the EPA's responsibility.Two sections have been added to this final rule. Section 220.5, Site SpecificPlan, requires the FEMA Regional Office to submit a relocation plan asoutlined under State Administration of Temporary Relocation Assistance,andSection; 220.18. The second addition, Cost Sharing, andSection; 220.17,identifies the need for State cost sharing during a remedial action andreferences 44 CFR Part 222, ``Cost Share Eligibility Criteria for Permanentand Temporary Relocation.''The general intent of FEMA's Superfund temporary relocation assistanceprogram is to provide temporary relocation assistance to individuals whohave been identified by the EPA as living in a hazardous substance affectedarea, and who should be temporarily relocated to protect their health andsafety during EPA's cleanup operations. Assistance covers reasonable livingexpenses which are additional to expenses incurred prior to displacement.The method of taking applications may vary among relocation sites. Potentialrelocatees generally will be personally notified by the administering entity.However, in larger operations, availability of assistance may be announcedthrough the media.The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the informationcollection requirements contained in this final rule under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, <T3>et seq. </T3>and has assigned OMB control numbers 3067-0156, 3067-0168and 3067-0184.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental considerations</ITAG>Based on an environmental assessment, FEMA has determined that there willbe no significant impact on the environment caused by implementation ofthis regulation. An Environmental Impact Statement will not be prepared.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The Agency has determined that this rule is not a major rule under ExecutiveOrder 12291, and I certify that the rule will not have a significant impacton a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act.

It is not intended to totally compensate these individualsfor all expenses and losses associated with contamination of the site onwhich they reside. Assistance covers reasonable living expenses that areadditional to the living expenses which existed prior to the relocation.Applicants are eligible only for categories of assistance where additionalexpenses are actually incurred. Nine categories of eligible assistance,designed to pay costs directly related to the temporary relocation programinclude: (a) Temporary housing in locally available private rentals; (b)subsistence payments for individuals placed in transient accommodations;(c) furniture assistance when individuals are placed in unfurnished temporaryhousing, or when the furniture at the permanent residence is contaminated;(d) transportation of household goods to temporary and back to permanentresidence; (e) utility subsidy covering the costs for primary residence;(f) utility connection costs at the temporary housing residence; (g) kennelcosts; (h) personal property purchase or decontamination costs; and (i)other expenses directly related to the relocation. The establishment ofthese categories of assistance does not prohibit advance of funds or establishmentof fixed funding rates for certain categories of assistance, when it isdetermined to be appropriate and cost-effective. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;220.4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Duplication of benefits.</ITAG>FEMA has determined that Temporary Relocation Assistance shall not be providedto an applicant if such assistance or its equivalent is received from anyother source. This also prohibits duplication of benefits by receipt oftemporary relocation assistance, and permanent relocation under CERCLA,or any disaster assistance. If any State or local government or volunteeragency is providing assistance for the same purpose as temporary relocationassistance, temporary relocation assistance under CERCLA, <T3>as amended</T3>, shall not begin until such other assistance is terminated.In the instance of insured applicants, assistance shall not be providedif insurance proceeds are available, unless there is a delay by the insurerin determining whether the proceeds will be available; there is ample reasonto believe that payment of the proceeds may be significantly delayed; suchproceeds have been exhausted; or, the proceeds are insufficient to providethe full cost of relocation benefits. Prior to provision of assistance,the insured applicant shall agree to repay FEMA from insurance proceedshe/she receives for additional living expenses, an amount equivalent tothe assistance provided, or that portion of insurance proceeds, whicheveris less. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;220.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Site specific plan. </ITAG>Each FEMA regional office must prepare a site specific Temporary RelocationPlan to be approved by the Regional Director or his or her official designee.The approved plan shall be submitted to the Assistant Associate Director,Disaster Assistance Programs (DAP), for review within seven days of signingan IAG with EPA.

Guidelines for hotel, motel and other short-term resourcesshall be developed only when there is a substantial variance in price amongthe available supply. The purpose of these fair market rent guidelinesis to prevent development of an inflated rental market resulting from theincident and to insure cost-effectiveness. These guidelines reflect thedesired maximum payment. Use of resources more costly than the guidelinesmay be authorized by the FEMA Regional Director or official designee forfull payment only when other existing resources are not available. Whenless than 10 families are being relocated, fair market rent guidelinesmay be established by a less time-consuming means, e.g., using an estimateprovided by real estate agencies or conducting a sampling instead of acomprehensive survey.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 220.12 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Transfer of occupants.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Transfers requested by occupants. </T3>Occupants who request to transferfrom one temporary housing unit to another, solely for their own convenienceor for reasons necessitated through their fault, shall be responsible forall expenses associated with the move, including any increase in temporaryhousing rent.(b) <T3>Transfers for other reasons. </T3>If FEMA initiates a transfer or ifa transfer is necessitated for reasons which are not the fault of an occupant,all essential costs of the move shall be paid by FEMA.

Withregard to valuable antiques, owners shall be paid whatever benefits theywould have received if this loss had been exclusively covered by theirhomeowners insurance policy. If they do not have homeowners insurance forpersonal property, owners shall be paid the cost of replacement with anitem of similar quality with the same functional use.(c) An appraisal shall be required in all instances.(d) Based on the appraisal, FEMA shall present the initial offer to acquireto the temporary relocation applicant. The offer to acquire shall be inwriting and will include a list of items to be purchased. The total valueof the listed items will be presented in the offer.(e) A written sales contract shall specify what is being purchased andthe terms and conditions of the sale, as well as the responsibilities ofthe seller. (f) When negotiations fail, after a reasonable effort by both parties,an individual who disputes the amount of the offer to acquire shall havethe right to submit a written appeal to the Regional Director.

(a) <T3>Grounds for termination. </T3>Temporary housing (including transientaccommodations) may be terminated for reasons, including, but not limitedto, the following:(1) A determination has been made by EPA that the residence from whichthe occupant was displaced is now available for occupancy. (2) FEMA has determined that the temporary housing occupant has failedto comply with the terms of the lease or reimbursement agreement. (3) An offer for permanent acquisition of the housing from which the individualhas been displaced has been made (and the time period for temporary housingallocated by FEMA's permanent relocation plan for the specific locationinvolved has passed). This includes an offer of relocation assistance,if appropriate. (4) The temporary housing occupant has failed to take due care of the temporarydwelling. (5) FEMA has determined that temporary housing was obtained through misrepresentationor fraud. (6) The temporary housing occupant has failed to pay utilities or othercharges, responsibility for which has been assigned by the lease or reimbursementagreement. (7) FEMA has determined that the temporary housing occupant has permanentlyrelocated to a new location. (b) <T3>Termination procedures. </T3>These procedures shall be utilized inall instances, except when a State is administering the Temporary RelocationAssistance Program. States shall be subject to their own procedures providedthey afford the occupant(s) due process safeguards described in paragraph(b)(5)(iv) of this section. (1) <T3>Notification of occupants. </T3>Written notice shall be given by FEMA(or the entity designated to administer the program) to the occupant(s)at least 30 days prior to the proposed termination of assistance. Thisnotice shall specify: The reasons for termination of assistance/occupancy;the date of termination, which shall not be less than 30 days after receiptof the notice; the administrative procedure available to the occupant(s)if he/she wishes to dispute the action; and the occupant's liability afterthe termination date for additional charges. <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Exception: </T4>Where the temporary housing occupants have been informedin writing, prior to receiving assistance from FEMA that the duration ofthe temporary housing assistance will be 30 days or less, there is no requirementfor a written notice. The notice of the limited duration of such assistanceor occupancy will also serve as notice of termination of the assistancefor occupancy. Those occupants will be notified by telephone or personalconversation as to the exact date of termination of assistance. If occupyingFEMA-leased housing, occupants shall be required to leave within 24 hoursfrom the time of the conversation regarding termination. </ITAG>(2) <T3>Filing of appeal. </T3>If the occupant desires to dispute the terminationof temporary housing assistance, upon receipt of the written notice specifiedin paragraph (b)(1) of this section, he/she shall present the appeal inwriting to the appropriate FEMA office in person or by mail within 5 businessdays.
