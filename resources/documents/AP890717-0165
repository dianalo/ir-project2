The Appropriations Committee's foreign operations panel added $30million to the Philippines aid program, called the MultilateralAssistance Initiative, bringing the total proposed U.S. share to$160 million for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.   But that total still was $40 million below the amount Secretaryof State James A. Baker III pledged for the program at a recentTokyo meeting with other nations participating in the developmenteffort.   In another concession to the Bush administration, subcommitteechairman Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., shifted $128 million from avariety of development programs to military aid grants. But theresulting total of $4.6 billion for military aid still fell wellbelow Bush's request of $5 billion.   The measure also was altered to earmark $15 million to pay for apackage of incentives Bush announced last week in Budapest toencourage economic and political reforms in Hungary.   ``I think we have made a considerable amount of progress,'' saidRep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., who got into an argument with Obeywhen the panel met last week and broke up without acting on the bill.   As usual, Israel and Egypt get the lion's share of U.S. aid as acontinuing reward for their agreement to the Camp David peaceprocess. Israel would get about $3 billion in military and economicaid, Egypt about $2 billion.   Money for the Export-Import bank, which subsidizes overseas salesof big-ticket items like airplanes for U.S. manufacturers, was cutby $60 million to $615 million.   The bill must be approved by the full committe before action bythe House.</TEXT></DOC>
