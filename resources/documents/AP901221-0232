LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   General Dynamics Corp. on Friday announced amajor reorganization of its Fort Worth Division, including thereassignment of the director of the troubled A-12 Avenger bomberprogram.   The St. Louis-based defense contractor said the reorganizationwould emphasize five business groups considered vital to thedivision's future, including the A-12 program, which the Pentagonhas threatened to scrap because of cost overruns and scheduleproblems.   The company said Charles Anderson, the A-12 program director,was reassigned as division vice president of a new unit calledSpecial Programs and Other Business.   His replacement is Ted Webb, the former head of the F-16 fighterjet program, who retired last year.   Company spokesman Mike Hatfield said Anderson's transfer waspart of an overall restructuring of the A-12 program. He said thereorganization had been in the works for several months and was nottied exclusively to the program.   General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas Corp. are the primecontractors on the troubled $4.8 billion bomber program.   On Thursday, the companies announced they were sending noticesto 8,000 workers warning they could be laid off if the Navyscrapped the program. A decision is expected as early as Jan. 2.   Last week, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered the Navy tojustify the project or kill it because of what he calledintolerable problems. Defense Department audits allege thathundreds of millions of dollars in excess payments have been madeto the two companies.   Earlier this week, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and Los AngelesTimes reported that a separate Pentagon audit concluded that theA-12 contractors have a ``possible chance of bankruptcy.''Officials of General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas disagreed withthe audit's findings.   Both companies have said they were cooperating with reviews ofthe A-12 and believed they had solved the major technical problemsthat had surfaced.   Under the reorganization announced Friday, a number of relatedelectronic products were combined in a Military Electronicsbusiness group. Special projects and other separate businesselements were combined in the Special Programs and Other Businessunit.   Each group will be headed by a division vice president, who willhave expanded authority and responsibility and will report directlyto company president Herbert F. Rogers, who is also general managerof the Fort Worth Division.   The changes are effective immediately and will be followed byother realignments within the division to focus resources on thefive key business areas, the company said.   Those areas include the F-16 fighter jet and the AdvancedTactical Fighter program.   General Dynamics is the nation's second-largest defensecontractor behind McDonnell Douglas. It has nine divisions and sixmajor subsidiaries, all involved in defense work except CessnaAircraft, which makes general aviation aircraft.</TEXT></DOC>
