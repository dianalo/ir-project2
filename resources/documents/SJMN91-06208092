Instead, it simply is collected from the assets of a fund.;    Tobegin with, you may pay considerably more or less than the average in fundfees, depending on how much you have invested and in what fund or funds.;   The $150 is an approximation of what you would be charged in a typical fund ifyou had about $10,000 in your account.;    Double your nest egg, and the feeis doubled as well. That principle applies except in cases where largeinvestors qualify for lower percentage charges.;    Your choice of funds makesa big difference, too. &quot;The annual expense ratios of funds range from aslittle as nothing (for funds being subsidized by their sponsors) to as high as9.5 percent,&quot; said Norman Fosback, editor of the Mutual Fund Forecasteradvisory letter in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.;    To get a line on how much anygiven fund might charge, you can check the fund's prospectus for the table offees the Securities and Exchange Commission began requiring in 1988.;    Thistable is &quot;a giant step forward in disclosing all the costs associated withbuying and owning mutual fund shares,&quot; said Sheldon Jacobs in the currentedition of his Handbook for No-Load Fund Investors.;    In the overall schemeof things, how important are fund expenses? After all, the results that a fundproduces include deductions for fees and expenses.;    So isn't an investorbetter off simply concentrating on the bottom line of total return individends earned and capital appreciation achieved?;    Final performance iswhat ultimately matters. But in the effort to gauge the chances for futureperformance, Fosback said, &quot;Hard data prove that higher expense ratios reallydo lead to lower net returns for shareholders.;    &quot;In the short run, thedifference of a few tenths of a percent of annual expense ratio may not beparticularly meaningful. However, over long periods of time different expenseratios can have an extraordinary impact on returns.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  New York  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910726  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  14D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  469  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday July 26, 199100208092,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
