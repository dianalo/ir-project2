Two senior Thai provincial officials said the fighting began onJuly 23, when hundreds of Karen rebels pounded the Mon rebels atBan Chedi, or Pagoda Village, with mortars and rocket-propelledgrenades. They said many civilians were killed or wounded in thethree-hour assault.   The officials said fighting died down today with both sidesshort of ammunition and food, but that about 500 Karen guerrillasstill were besieging about 300 Mon rebels.   The village is in southeastern Mon State and opposite the Thaivillage of Three Pagoda Pass in Kanchanaburi province, about 175miles northwest of Bangkok.   The officials, quoting military intelligence reports, spoke oncondition of anonymity.   The Karen and the Mon are two of about a dozen ethnic minoritygroups who have been fighting the Burmese government for fourdecades for greater autonomy. Both maintain their strongholds alongBurma's eastern border with Thailand, and both generally havecooperated with each other, using the same smuggling routes.   But the fighting erupted after Karen rebels said armed Monguerrillas demanded ``protection money'' from Karen civilians whopassed through Mon-controlled areas to engage in illegal trade withThai villagers.   The Mons said the Karens extorted similar taxes from Moncivilians passing through Karen-controlled areas, the Thaiofficials said.   The officials said fire broke out in the village market duringthe July 23 attack, and smoke could be seen from the Thai side ofthe border.   The Karens then got reinforcements from other rebel groups totry to capture the village, but the Mons fought back, they said.   The most recent big clash was on Sunday, when the Karens againattacked with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades, setting thevillage market ablaze. The attack lasted 30 minutes, the Thaiofficials said.   Thai intelligence officers who crossed the border after Sunday'sfighting and walked near the besieged village said they smelled thestench of rotting corpses.   The provincial officials said one Thai soldier was killed andanother soldier wounded by mortar fire that strayed into Thailandduring the fighting.   Thai officials said border patrol policemen and soldiers weredispatched to the frontier to push back hundreds of Burmesecivilians who tried to cross into Thailand to escape the fighting.About 300 Thais living in the border area have been moved furtheraway, they said.   The Mons and the Karens have been fighting Burma since it gainedits independence from Britain in 1948. They contend the governmenthas reneged on pledges to grant autonomy to ethnic groups.   Among Burma's 38 million people, there are about 3 millionKarens and 1.3 million Mons. Both are predominately Buddhist,although the Karen elite is mainly Christian.</TEXT></DOC>
