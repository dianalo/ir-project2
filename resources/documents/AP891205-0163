East Germans, furious about past corruption, surrounded secretpolice offices in several cities to stop further destruction ofdocuments that could be used to prosecute Honecker, who was partychief for 18 years, and his former lieutenants.   Under Honecker, the secret police were the main instrument forkeeping people under control. The official news agency ADN reportedTuesday night that its 19 top officials resigned but the new chief,Lt. Gen. Wolfgang Schwanitz, would remain in office.   Schwanitz has criticized the organizaton's past role in crushingdissent.   Guenter Wendland, the chief prosecutor, also resigned followingallegations that he was unfit to lead corruption investigations.Wendland was a holdover from the Honecker era.   Communist Party leaders appealed for calm to avoid ``anarchy andchaos'' in a nation that, in two months, has seen the dismissal oftwo sets of leaders, mass pro-democracy protests, the historicopening of its borders and promises of free elections and otherreforms.   The Interior Ministry said the goverment was disarming the``fighting groups,'' party-run militias based in factories.   It said the weapons taken away included automatic rifles,rocket-propelled grenades, anti-aircraft guns and armored personnelcarriers.   Western estimates said the militias had 3,000 active members,but could draw on reserves of 500,000.   On Monday, militia officers had urged the rank-and-file to breaktheir oath of loyalty to the Communist Party.   In Czechoslovakia, the army began Saturday to disarm theCommunist Party's paramilitary People's Militia, which was created40 years ago to protect factories from counterrevolutionaries.Opposition leaders had demanded the militia be disbanded.   East Germany's top lawyer, Wolfgang Vogel, was arrested Tuesdayon suspicion of ``criminal extortion,'' the official ADN newsagency said.   However, early Wednesday, ADN said Vogel had been released andthe ``allegation of criminal extortion had proven to be unfounded.''   It said the allegation concerned Vogel's representation offugitive East German official Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski.   Prosecutors determined that Vogel ``during his representation ofSchalck-Golodkowski had done his duty as a lawyer, of whichupholding the pledge of secrecy is a part.''   ADN said prosecutors also had apologized to Vogel.   Vogel handled spectacular East-West spy and prisoner swaps foryears and was a confidant of Honecker. Honecker and several othermembers of the old leadership are the main targets of thecorruption investigations. He has been expelled from the party andthree members of his Politburo are in prison.   Authorities placed Honecker and other former top officials underhouse arrest Tuesday in their luxurious Wandlitz compound north ofEast Berlin. The compound has become a symbol of past corruptionand abuse.   ``The former general secretary (of the Communist Party) andpresident Erich Honecker is among those who are not allowed toleave their houses in the elegant compound,'' ADN reported.Wandlitz has 23 houses, once filled with Politburo members andtheir families.   The house arrests were an act of ``national self-defense'' andresulted from ``the will of the people,'' said Harri Haarland, thedeputy chief prosecutor.   The house arrests are intended to keep the former Politburomembers from fleeing the country. Schalck-Golodkowski, the formertop official for trade with the West, fled after allegations thathe was involved in huge weapons deals.   ``All former Politburo members who after Oct. 19 were no longermembers of the Politburo and who are still in Wandlitz'' were underhouse arrest, ADN said. Honecker lost his job in a major powerreshuffle on Oct. 18. His successor, Egon Krenz, resigned on Sunday.   ADN did not specify the number under house arrest.   Honecker, 77, has been in ill health following gall-bladdersurgery last summer, and had been a virtual recluse in Wandlitzeven before his arrest.   There were growing reports of bands of angry citizens surgingtoward local headquarters of the secret police, to prevent thedestruction of documents that could be used in criminal trials.   About 2,000 East Germans tried to force their way into thesecret police headquarters in Suhl, and a delegation of the angrycitizens eventually was let inside, ADN said. It quoted localsecret police chief, Gerhard Lange, as saying documents there hadalready been destroyed.   Angry citizens also forced their way into the secret policeheadquarters in the city of Erfurt, ADN added, while severalhundred citizens kept watch outside secret police headquarters inthe northern city of Rostock.   In other developments Tuesday:   _ The government said it is studying a possible prisoneramnesty, in addition to the release of those imprisoned in yearsand months past for trying to escape from East Germany. Theannouncement did not specify if political prisoners were involved.   _ West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff announcedthat Kohl will meet with East German Premier Hans Modrow in Dresdenon Dec. 19.   _ East Germany lifted visa requirements and mandatory currencyexchanges for West Germans, according to Kohl aide Rudolf Seiters,meeting one of Bonn's major conditions for improving ties with itstroubled Communist neighbor. </TEXT></DOC>
