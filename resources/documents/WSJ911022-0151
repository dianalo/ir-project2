In a suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the EasternDistrict of Pennsylvania, the SEC alleged that R. JamesMacaleer, chairman; James Kelly, secretary; and Clyde Hyde, aformer director, sold Shared Medical stock in late 1986 toavoid an expected drop in the value of the Malvern, Pa.,company's stock.</LP><TEXT>   The SEC said Messrs. Macaleer, Kelly and Hyde sold morethan 157,300 Shared Medical shares after learning that thecompany's annual growth rate had declined 20%. Mr. Macaleeralso sold 22,000 shares of Shared Medical stock held in atrust account for his children, the SEC said.   The commission said the three sold their shares for $35 to$41.875 per share. When the news about Shared Medical'sgrowth rate became public, the company's stock dropped to $27per share.   The SEC also charged that from September 1986 through May1987, the defendants made false statements and omittedrelevant information concerning Shared Medical Systems'decline in revenue and earnings growth. Shared Medicalprovides software systems to hospitals and doctors.   Mr. Hyde, without admitting or denying the allegations,agreed to settle the charges. The consent agreement bars himfrom future securities-law violations, and he has agreed topay penalties of $24,646. His attorney declined to comment.   Shared Medical, in a statement, denied the allegations andsaid it would fight the charges against its officers. Thecompany said similar allegations were raised in a classaction in 1987 and that the company paid an after-tax cost of$1.6 million to settle that suit.   But in its statement, Mr. Macaleer said the companyshouldn't have settled the 1987 suit. &quot;First, we had donenothing wrong, and second, far too many people assume that asettlement implies guilt,&quot; he said. &quot;Had we taken the 1987suit to trial and won, which we believe would have been theprobable outcome, we wouldn't be facing SEC allegationstoday.&quot;   Shared Medical stock rose 25 cents to close yesterday at$21.50 a share in national over-the-counter trading.</TEXT></DOC>
