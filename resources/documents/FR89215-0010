Effective February 15,1989 for affected facilities located in Regions I, III, and V, MCandamp;Alicensing reviews required by 10 CFR 70.32(c) and inspections will be performedby the Domestic Safeguards and Regional Oversight Branch, Division of Safeguardsand Transportation, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards. Theperformance of these activities for facilities located in Region II willremain in Region II until further notice by the Commission. This actionis necessary because the small number of affected facilities in each regioncannot support the full spectrum of knowledge, skills, and disciplinesneeded to conduct MCandamp;A inspections.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> February 15, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Dr. Stanley L.

Nationwide, there are, at the present time, sixteen non-reactorfacilities required to maintain MCandamp;A programs and which are subjectto MCandamp;A inspections (10 fuel cycle and 6 others). Transfer of theselicensing and inspection activities from Regions I, III, and V to the DomesticSafeguards and Regional Oversight Branch, Division of Safeguards and Transportation,Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards is effective February15, 1989 while the Region II MCandamp;A inspection program and 10 CFR 70.32(c)licensing reviews will be phased into Headquarters through Region II staffattrition or over a two-year period, whichever occurs first. Region IVhas not affected facilities.This centralization for these functions is needed because the relativelysmall annual workload requirements for the NRC in the majority of Regionsforeclose the possibility of maintaining within each Region a full spectrumof the knowledge, skills, and disciplines needed to perform MCandamp;A inspections.Centralization in NRC Headquarters will assure the maintenance of a viableand adequate nationwide MCandamp;A inspection program for non-reactor facilities.These revisions, necessitated by the centralization, are administrativein nature. They change the NRC recipient office point of contact for licenseereports, and conform the regulation to track the responsibilities now assignedto the Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards.Because these are amendments dealing with minor matters of agency managementand personnel, the notice and comment provisions of the AdministrativeProcedure Act do not apply pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). These amendmentsare effective upon publication in the<T4> Federal Register</T4>. Good cause exists to dispense with the usual30-day delay in the effective date because the amendments are of a minorand administrative nature dealing with the centralization to Headquartersof licensing and inspection activities formerly conducted in the NRC RegionalOffices.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion</ITAG>The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action describedin categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2). Therefore, neither an environmentalimpact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared forthis final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act Statement</ITAG>This final rule does not contain a new or amended information collectionrequirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3> et seq.</T3>). Existing requirements were approved by the Office ofManagement and Budget approval numbers 3150-0009 and 3150-0123.<ITAG tagnum="84">Backfit Analysis</ITAG>The backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to the facilities subjectto this final rulemaking. Therefore, no backfit analysis has been prepared.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>10 CFR Part 70Hazardous materials_transportation, Nuclear materials, Packaging and containers,Penalty, Radiation protection, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,Scientific equipment, Security measures, Special nuclear material.10 CFR Part 74Accouting, Hazardous materials_transportation, Material control and accounting,Nuclear materials, Packaging and containers, Penalty, Radiation protection,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Scientific equipment, Specialnuclear material.For the reasons set out in the preamble and under the authority of theAtomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Energy Reorganization Act of1974, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 552 and 553, the NRC is adopting the followingamendments to 10 CFR Parts 70 and 74.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 70_DOMESTIC LICENSING OF SPECIAL NUCLEAR MATERIAL</ITAG>1.
