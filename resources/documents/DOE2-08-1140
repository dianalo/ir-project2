The primary reason for the change was to reduce the attritionof operators by increasing their job satisfaction. Eighty-four percentof the operators favored the change. Plant performance and safety werenot adversely affected. A statistical analysis of 53 operator-related,off-normal events in 28 months concluded that there was no significantdifference in either the number or the severity of off-normal eventson the 12-hour shift. A statistical analysis of 200,000 log entries concludedthat the error rate in completing logs actually declined by 25 percenton the 12-hour shift. Alertness, which was measured using computerizedtests of mathematics and logical reasoning, reach a nadir on the firstnight shift for the 8- and 12-hour schedules alike, which indicates thatthe primary cause of fatigue was sleep disruption, not cumulative hoursof work. All supervisors and 52 percent of the operators believe theircrews work more effectively on the 12-hour shift; only 12 percent ofthe operators believe that their crews work less effectively. The evaluationindicated that the 12-hour shift scheduled is a reasonable alternativeto an 8-hour schedule at this facility. 2 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
