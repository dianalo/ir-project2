The pulse length foreseenon TORE SUPRA project is between 30 and 210 seconds. Power tetrodes usedfor cyclotronic heating must be built in order to sustain stresses duringnormal operation which depend on four parameters: - output power; - VSWR;- upper operating frequency; - pulse length. The outcoming tetrode isa trade off between contradictory constraints depending on these fourparameters. The calculation of the power dissipated on each electroderesulting from a theoretical approach to the problem allows to determinethe thermal stress on each part of the tube. Tube design and materialscan be selected in order to reduce and to withstand these stresses.</TEXT></DOC>
