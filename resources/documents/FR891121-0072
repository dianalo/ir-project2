Texas Eastern Transmission</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">[Docket No. CP87-312-006]</ITAG>Take notice that on October 31, 1989, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation,(Texas Eastern), P.O. Box 2521, Houston, Texas 77252. filed in Docket No.CP87-312-006 and amended application pursuant to section 7(c) of the NaturalGas Act, and the Rules and Regulations of the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission, for a certificate of public convenience and necessity, requestingauthorization to construct, replace and operate certain pipeline facilitiesto render firm transportation service pursuant to Rate Schedule FTS-5,Phases II and III, all as more fully set forth in the application whichis on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.Texas Eastern states that its amended application modifies its facilitiesand their in-service dates from its previous application in Docket No.CP87-312-004 to implement its participation in Phases II and III of therestructuring and unbundling of storage services previously proposed tobe rendered under the PennEast Gas Services Company Rate Schedule PSS.It is stated that CNG Transmission Corporation (CNG) has advised TexasEastern and its customers of a one year delay in the development of thestorage fields supporting the proposed storage service to be rendered byCNG. Therefore, this amended application reflects a one year delay in thecommencement of proposed FTS-5 Phases II and III transportation serviceto 1991 and 1992. It is further stated that the one year delay has requiredTexas Eastern to revise the construction sequence of the FTS-5 facilitiesand other pending projects, and such facility revisions are relected inthis amended application.Specifically, Texas Eastern requests authorization to: (1) render firmtransportation service pursuant to Rate Schedule FTS-5, Phases II and III,up to the following Maximum Daily Transportation Quantities (MDTQ) listedbelow; and (2) construct, own, and operate pipeline facilities locatedin various counties in Pennsylvania.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp0,i1,s50,10,10,10</C> <H1>Buyer</H1><H1>Phase II \1\ increase (Dt/Day)</H1><H1>Phase III \2\ increase (Dt/Day)</H1><H1>Aggregate MDTQ Dt/Day)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Bristol andamp; Warren Gas Co<D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>813</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Central Hudson Gas andamp; Electric Co<D>2,000 </D><D>0 </D><D>6,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Colonial Gas Co<D>52 </D><D>52 </D><D>2,326</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Elizabethtown Gas Co<D>10,000 </D><D>0 </D><D>10,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Intercontinental Energy Corp. andamp; Public Service Electric andamp; Gas<D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>24,508</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Long Island Lighting Co<D>15,000 </D><D>20,000 </D><D>50,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">New Jersey National Gas Co<D>10,000 </D><D>20,000 </D><D>35,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Penn Fuel Gas, Inc<D>1,000 </D><D>1,000 </D><D>4,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Public Service Electric andamp; Gas Co<D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>45,084</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">South County Gas Co<D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>248</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Texas Eastern System Storage<D>0 </D><D>20,000 </D><D>20,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Valley Gas Co<D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>1,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Yankee Gas Services Co<D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>125</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Totals <D>38,052 </D><D>61,052 </D><D>\3\ 199,104</D><F>\1\ Phase II_Commencing 11/15/91.</F><F>\2\ Phase III_Commencing 11/15/92.</F><F>\3\ FTS-5 Phase I quantity totals 100,000 Dt/Day.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Texas Eastern requests authorization to replace and operate 4.25 milesof existing 20-inch pipeline No. 2 with 36-inch pipeline between Station25 and Station 26 (M.P. 1394.47 to M.P. 1398.72) under Phase II (1991);and replace and operate 5.25 miles of existing 20-inch pipeline No. 2 with36-inch pipeline between Station 25 and Station 26 (M.P 1398.72 to M.P.1403.97), and install and operate up to 6,500 HP electric compressor unitat Station 22-A under Phase III (1992). It is stated that the estimatedcapital cost of the proposed facilities is $8,289,000 for Phase II (1991)and $25,716,000 for Phase III (1992), and that the facilities will be financedfrom funds on hand and funds generated from operations.It is stated that upon the later of November 15, 1991 (Phase II) and November15, 1992 (Phase III) or the completion of all necessary facilities foreach phase, transportation service under Rate Schedule FTS-5 (Phases IIand III) shall consist of the transportation of gas for the account ofBuyer received by Texas Eastern from Buyer for delivery to CNG and thetransportation of gas for the account of Buyer received by Texas Easternfrom CNG for delivery to or for the account of Buyer. In particular, TexasEastern would receive gas for transportation under Rate Schedule FTS-5(Phases II and III) from CNG, or deliver gas to CNG for storage for theaccount of Buyer, at the interconnection of CNG's proposed North Summitstorage field pipeline and Texas Eastern's existing system. Texas Easternwould deliver gas received from CNG to points of delivery with Buyer, orin the case of the Algonquin customers, volumes to Algonquin at MeasuringStation 087 near Lambertville, Pennsylvania. Texas Eastern would receivethe gas from the Buyers for storage injection at their existing deliverypoints with Texas Eastern by displacement of quantities otherwise deliveredand will redeliver such quantities to CNG at the CNG North Summit facility.The cost of service associated with the incremental facilities requiredto render the FTS-5 service (Phases II and III) will be borne by all Buyersreceiving the FTS-5 service. For all gas transported, commencing November15, 1991 and November 15, 1992, Texas Eastern will charge a monthly demandrate of $5.464 and $6.665 per dt, respectively, and an authorized dailyoverrun rate of $0.180 and $0.219 per dt, respectively. The demand ratesfor Phases II and III involve the accumulation of cost of service attributableto Phases I and II and a uniform rate to all FTS-5 customers which TexasEastern states is consistent with prior Commission's treatment of ratesfor Texas Eastern's other phased storage delivery services. It is further stated that Consolidated Edison Company of NY (Con Ed) hasadvised CNG and that it does not require the 20,000 dt per day previouslyproposed for Phase III. Texas Eastern stated that it has agreed with CNGto purchase the storage capacity released by Con Ed for Texas Eastern'sown storage requirements. Texas Eastern anticipates re-marketing the storageand transportation capacity released by Con Ed to other customers on theeast coast, and that such re-marketing is permitted by Texas Eastern'sagreement with CNG. <T3>Comment date: </T3>December 5, 1989, in accordance with the first subparagraphof Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">2.

Oklahoma-Arkansas Pipeline Company </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">[Docket No. CP90-187-000] </ITAG>Take notice that on October 31, 1989, Oklahoma-Arkansas Pipeline Company(Oklahoma-Arkansas), P.O. Box 2521, Houston, Texas 77252, filed in DocketNo. CP90-187-000, an application pursuant to section 7(c) of the NaturalGas Act and subpart E of part 157 and subpart G of part 284 of the Commission'sRegulations for an optional certificate of public convenience and necessityand a blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizingArkansas-Oklahoma to: (1) engage in the transportation of natural gas ininterstate commerce as a natural gas company; (2) to construct, own andoperate a new natural gas pipeline to be used in the transportation ofup to approximately 500,000 dekatherms per day (dtd) of natural gas fromthe Arkoma producing area of Oklahoma; (3) to transport gas on a self-implementingbasis with pregranted abandonment authority; and (4) through the proposedfacilities. Oklahoma-Arkansas requests authority to construct, own and operate an interstatenatural gas pipeline system commencing in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma andextending eastward 352 miles through Arkansas to a terminus at an interconnectionwith Trunkline Gas Company (Trunkline) in Tate County, Mississippi. Oklahoma-Arkansasproposes to transport volumes of natural gas up to the full 500,000 Dtdesign capacity of its system on a firm or interruptible basis, on behalfof shippers who may include producers, interstate pipelines, local distributioncompanies, cogenerators, marketers and end users. Specifically, Oklahoma-Arkansas proposes: (1) To engage in the receipt, transmission and redelivery of natural gasin interstate commerce and thus become a natural gas company, as definedin the NGA, subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission; (2) To construct, own and operate a new transmission system to transportgas from the Arkoma Producing area; (3) To perform self-implementing transportation under blanket authoritypursuant to andSection; 284.221 of the Commission's Regulations;(4) For pregranted authority to abandon service upon expiration of theapplicable transportation service agreements subject to the notice requirementsof andSection; 157.103(f)(2) of the Commission's Regulations; and (5) For approval of initial rates as provided in pro forma Rate SchedulesFTS-1, FTS-2 and ITS. Oklahoma-Arkansas states that the proposed facilities would have a maximumcapacity of 500,000 Dt of natural gas per day for a distance extendingfrom the Arkoma Basin to existing facilities at Texas Eastern TransmissionCorporation's (TETCO) Bald Knob Compressor Station in White County, Arkansasand at Trunkline Gas Company's (Trunkline) Independence Compresor Stationin Tate County, Mississippi. It is indicated that additional interconnectswith other interstate pipelines intersected by Oklahoma-Arkansas's proposedline will be proposed at a later date, under other authorizations, at pointsmutually agreeable to Oklahoma-Arkansas and the interstate pipelines. Oklahoma-Arkansas states that the proposed facilities would consist of240.15 miles of 36-inch pipe and 112.20 miles of 30-inch pipe. Specifically,68.7 miles of 36-inch pipe would be installed in various counties in Oklahoma,171.45 miles of 36-inch and 77.7 miles of 30-inch pipe would be installedin various counties in Arkansas and 34.5 miles of 30-inch pipe would beinstalled in various counties in Mississippi. It is stated that measurementfacilities would be located at the interconnections with TETCO and Trunkline.Oklahoma-Arkansas states that the peak design capacity of the proposedfacilities would be 500,000 Dt per day, with a 259,000 Dt per day deliverycapacity to TETCO and 241,000 Dt per day to Trunkline.Oklahoma-Arkansas states that the estimated cost of the proposed facilitiesis $273,528,000. Oklahoma-Arkansas indicates that it would finance thecost of these facilities through partnership borrowing and partnershipcontributions at a debt to equity ratio of 70/30.Oklahoma-Arkansas proposes to transport up to 500,000 Dt per day of naturalgas on both a firm and interruptible basis by providing transportationservices on an open-access basis pursuant to a Part 284, Subpart G blanketcertificate. It is explained that firm transportation would be providedpursuant to proposed Rate Schedules FTS-1 and FTS-2. Interruptible service,it is indicated, would be available pursuant to proposed Rate ScheduleITS.Oklahoma-Arkansas states that it is providing for multiple receipt anddelivery points in its transportation service agreements. For firm service,it is indicated that shippers could designate multiple receipt points aslong as the total volumes tendered for firm service from these points donot exceed the total volumes under the transportation agreement. As anadded feature, Oklahoma-Arkansas states that shippers would be allowedto designate for the firm service additional ``interruptible'' receiptpoints which will be utilized on a capacity available basis. It is furtherindicated that shippers would not be required to provide necessary linepack, thereby avoiding a significant record keeping burden.Oklahoma-Arkansas states that shippers electing Rate Schedules FTS-1 wouldbe allowed to participate in a transportation assignment program pursuantto the provisions of Section 7 of the proposed FTS-1 Rate Schedule. Oklahoma-Arkansasproposes to allow FTS-1 shippers to assign on either a firm or interruptiblebasis all or a portion of their firm transportation service pursuant toRate Schedule FTS-1 to third parties, provided that such shippers submita notice in writing to Oklahoma-Arkansas or Oklahoma-Arkansas's designatedoperator indicating their desire to engage in the assignment of transportationservice. Oklahoma-Arkansas further proposes that assignees who have beenassigned rights on a firm basis be permitted to reassign these firm rightson either a firm or interruptible basis.Oklahoma-Arkansas states that in order to provide all potential shippersan opportunity to obtain initial transportation services, Oklahoma-Arkansasis establishing an ``open season'' to accept requests for both firm andinterruptible transportation services on a first-come, first-served basisfor all requests received on or before January 12, 1990.Oklahoma-Arkansas states that the pro forma tariff and illustrative rates,are designed to conform to the requirements of part 284, subpart G andpart 157, subpart E and to meet the varying needs of potential shippers.Oklahoma-Arkansas proposed to offer the same firm transportation serviceunder two separate rate schedules, either of which shippers may elect attheir discretion. Oklahoma-Arkansas states that it is indifferent as towhich rate schedule a shipper might find preferential. It is asserted thathigh load factor shippers, such as cogenerators and certain industrialusers, as well as shippers who anticipate lower system utilization wouldbenefit greatly from having this ``basket'' rate selection available. Itis stated that under either the FTS-1 rate schedule or the FTS-2 ModifiedFixed Variable (MFV) rate schedule, shippers would have the same priorityof service. It is anticipated that these rate schedules, as described belowand in the pro forma tariff, meet or exceed the requirements of part 157,subpart E. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of these firm rate schedules.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,b2,i1,xl24,xl30,xl38,5,6,6</C><T4>Table </T4>1<H1>Schedule </H1><H1>Design </H1><H1>Return </H1><H1>Load Factor LF </H1><H1>Rates </H1><H2>Demand </H2><H2>Commodity</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">FTS-1 <D>Demand </D><D>ROE=15% </D><D>100% </D><D>$9.493 </D><D>^0^</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">FTS-2 <D>MFV </D><D>ROE=16% </D><D>90% </D><D>$6.513 </D><D>$.1196</D></ITAG></ITAG>Oklahoma-Arkansas proposes that a one part firm demand rate is permissibleunder the provisions of Part 157, Subpart E when a shipper can freely choosebetween other equivalent services. It is explained that if the shipperso desires he could receive a benefit, ie, a lower rate, for absorbinga greater portion of the risk associated with the venture while alternatively,the shipper could elect to place Oklahoma-Arkansas at risk for certainfixed and variable costs through selection of the Rate Schedule FTS-2 servicedescribed below. It is stated that to ameliorate the risk the FTS-1 customerswould absorb, Oklahoma-Arkansas would provide the transportation assignmentprogram for FTS-1 shippers as previously described.Oklahoma-Arkansas states that Rate Schedule ITS is designed as an interruptibleservice, consistent with the Party 284(G) blanket certificate requirements.Oklahoma-Arkansas proposes a one-part volumetric rate for interruptibleservice, discountable between maximum and minimum levels. It is indicatedthat the maximum interruptible rate of $0.3337 would be equal to the FTS-2100% load factor rate.Oklahoma-Arkansas's proposed facilities it is asserted, provide a costefficient means to connect numerous and diverse markets with substantialnew gas reserves.
