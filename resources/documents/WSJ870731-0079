You quote Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker's June 20 letter on the FSLIC recapitalization, and in the next breath criticize Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire for seeking to close the non-bank bank loophole in the context of this bill. Conveniently overlooked in your editorial is that Mr. Volcker very strongly supports Sen. Proxmire in that regard.    The June 20 Volcker letter reads inter alia, &quot;For several years I have supported closing the non-bank bank loophole to reaffirm the basic policy commitment of the United States to a separation of banking from commerce, which I believe is essential to maintaining a banking system that is fair, efficient and safe and sound.&quot;    Mr. Volcker, like Sen. Proxmire and unlike the Journal's editorial writers, urges the House-Senate conferees &quot;to set the framework for the urgently needed re-evaluation of the structure of the financial system&quot; by closing this loophole now.
