The suit, filed in state court here, alleges that the vocational-school and student-loan-servicing concern, based in Encino, Calif., issued a series of &quot;materially false and/or misleading positive public statements, and omitted material facts regarding {the company's} revenues, profits and growth.&quot; The suit further claims that such misleading statements were made even while the company was mired in problems regarding &quot;false reporting of revenues associated with the fraudulent servicing of federally and state guaranteed student loans owned by the California Student Loan Finance Corp., and with the fraudulent obtaining of and administration of such student loans for students at its trade schools.&quot;    A spokesman for United Education declined to comment on the suit.    An article in Barron's last month discussed federal auditors' examinations of whether United Education followed proper procedures before declaring thousands of loans in default and collecting insurance on them. The company disclosed the review in early August, saying it involved &quot;apparent computer-related servicing problems.&quot;    The shareholder suit, which seeks class-action status, claims that the &quot;positive&quot; public statements issued by United Education served to artificially inflate its stock price. The suit was filed by Allan R. Palapinger, a Pennsylvania resident who bought 500 United Education shares at $22.50 a share March 24.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, shares of United Education closed at $4.75, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
