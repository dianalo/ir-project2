More than 100,000 people werereported arrested and 10 killed.   A daylong general strike shut down commerce and transportation inthe six states governed by the opposition, but it was less effectivein the 19 states controlled by Gandhi's Congress Party.   At least 80 people, including five policemen, were injured andmore than 103,450 people were arrested during the strike, policesaid.   United News of India reported two people were killed during aclash involving police and pro- and anti-government demonstrators inthe southern state of Kerala, which is governed by a coalition ledby the Marxist Communist Party.   The news agency said seven people were killed in the northeasternstate of Tripura, also governed by the Marxist Communist Party. Fourof the victims died when strike supporters hurled a bomb at apassenger bus, the new agency said. Two were killed in a clashbetween police and strike supporters, and one person was stabbed todeath, it said.   In Calcutta, the country's largest city and the capital ofMarxist-ruled West Bengal state, one opposition supporter was killedand 46 injured as police fired into the air and threw tear gas totry to separate the warring groups, police said.   V.P. Singh, leader of the fractious opposition, said more than100,000 opposition supporters were arrested in eastern Bihar statefor enforcing the strike. At least 36 people were hurt, eight ofthem seriously, when baton-carrying police charged stone-throwingmobs, witnesses said.   About 2,700 people, including 16 lawmakers, were arrested forsitting on railroad tracks in southern Tamil Nadu state, policesaid. Arrests during such protests are routine and detainees arereleased after a few hours without charges.   More than 700 opposition activists were arrested in southernAndhra Pradesh states, while 50 were taken into custody in northernPunjab state, police said.   In New Delhi's central shopping arcade, police used batons tobreak up clashes between pro- and anti-government supporters.Opposition leader Atal Behar Vajpayee and several members of hisIndian People's Party were arrested, police said.   The altercation broke out as activists trying to enforce thestrike were confronted by Congress Party workers, police said.   ``As a member of the opposition I wanted the strike to besuccessful, but I also wanted it to be peaceful and non-violent,''said Devi Lal, chief minister of northern Haryana state and a keyopposition leader.   The opposition has been trying for nearly two years to focusattention on government corruption. But previous efforts haverapidly lost momentum, largely because squabbling opposition leaderscould not agree on a strategy.   Last month, in a rare display of unity, 106 opposition membersresigned from Parliament, saying a government audit into acontroversial arms deal proved kickbacks were paid to seniorofficials and members of Gandhi's party.   Opposition leaders contend a Swedish company, AB Bofors, paid $50million dollars in kickbacks and bribes to secure a $1.4 billioncontract to supply artillery guns to the Indian army. The governmentand the company deny wrongdoing.   An opinion poll conducted in July by the respected news magazineIndia Today indicated Gandhi and the Congress Party were almostcertain to win the election. According to the poll of 10,399registered voters, the party would return to power capturing 58percent of the 542 seats in the decision-making lower house ofParliament.   Today's strike was called in part to gauge the opposition's cloutbefore parliamentry elections, which must be held by Jan. 4, 1990.   Most shops and businesses in the capital closed despite increasedpolice.   Government offices operated normally as thousands of employeesstayed overnight in their workplaces. The government had said thosewho failed to work would lose a day's salary.   State-run Delhi Transport Corporation operated its entire fleetof 3,800 passenger buses, PTI quoted an official as saying. Butwitnesses said most buses had few passengers.   Press Trust of India said mobs hurled stones at buses inopposition-controlled areas of New Delhi and at least 14 vehicleswere damaged. Several activists of the right-wing Indian People'sParty were arrested following the violence, it said withoutelaborating.   The other participants of the strike are the Communist Party ofIndia, the Marxist Communist Party and the National Front, a groupof seven parties.   On Tuesday, police arrested at least 5,000 political workersacross the country to prevent violence.</TEXT></DOC>
