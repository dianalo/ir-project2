Fishing boats will be barred from many areas of the sound whenthe season starts May 15, said state biologist James Brady.   At one time, officials had considered canceling the seasonaltogether, just as they had canceled the $12 million herringfishing season and smaller seasons in the sound for shrimp andsablefish after the Exxon Valdez ran aground and spilled more than10 million gallons of oil March 24.   Instead, fishermen will be crowded into a smaller area inefforts to keep their nets clear of oil that would contaminatewhatever salmon are caught.   ``I feel confident that we will be able to proceed with oursalmon fisheries,'' said Brady, a biologist with the AlaskaDepartment of Fish and Game. ``But we will have to sacrifice someharvest.''   State officials will test whatever salmon is brought in by the760 fishermen, and pledge that no contaminated fish will reach themarket. Spotting and smelling fish tainted by crude oil is easy,biologists say.   Also Saturday, skies cleared and the seas were calm, allowingthe cleanup to resume after several days of waiting out blusteryweather.   Pilots in oil-hunting spotter planes and slicker-garbed crewsaboard skimmer boats coordinated their collection efforts as thetar-like residue floated just off or coated shorelines on the KenaiPeninsula.   About 300 people using the USS Juneau as a floating hotel rodelanding craft to Smith Island where crews are trying to hose downrocky beaches before pregnant harbor seals haul out to have theirpups.   Teams from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationand from the state Department of Fish and Game toured Sugarloaf andMarmot islands off the Kenai Peninsula. Those may be next on thelist to be cleaned for seals, the Coast Guard said.   The sections of Prince William Sound most likely to be closedfor the May salmon season include prime fishing grounds along theouter edge where pink salmon arrive still a bright silver aftermonths at sea, Brady said.   The 6 million salmon expected to return to the Sawmill BayHatchery probably will be off-limits to fishing ships because ofthe oil, although hatchery managers may be allowed to take fishinside the bay in order to recover expenses.   Other closures may include the western and southwest corner ofthe sound where non-hatchery salmon gather before making their runsup freshwater streams.   ``A lot of the bigger slicks have moved out of the sound, or arehard on the beach,'' Brady said. ``But there's still a lot of oilon the water.''   There is some concern that fishing boats helping in the cleanupwill be contaminated by the clinging goo. ``We have to make sure wedon't have oily boats carrying clean fish,'' Alaska environmentalcommissioner Dennis Kelso said.   Exxon vice president Ulyesse LeGrange promised the oil companywould stockpile extra nets in case fishermen's nets getcontaminated, but state biologist Brady predicted, ``If fishermenhit oil, we will run out of gear.''   Fishermen are preparing for an unusual salmon season.   ``We've heard a lot of politicians and even James Brady speak ofa fishery as normal, and that concerns us,'' Mike Schomer of theCopper River Fishermen's Cooperative said.   ``I don't think we're ging to have by any means a normalfishery.''</TEXT></DOC>
