Two businessmen in bowler hats tried water-skiing to work on theThames, but not even a police escort could get the two monarchs to a700-year-old church on time for an ecumenical service.   The 24-hour strike, which Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called``absolutely disgraceful,'' idled all railroads and nearly theentire London subway system. It was the second big transit strike ina week and the eighth walkout in 12 weeks by London Undergroundworkers.   Elizabeth and Beatrix were 15 minutes late at the Dutch Church inLondon's financial district, but the service marking three centuriessince William of Orange of Holland and his English wife Mary tookthe English throne did not start without them.   The church was founded in 1253 and rebuilt after being bombed inWorld War II.   ``Police outriders tried to clear the traffic but there wasnowhere to clear it,'' a Buckingham Palace spokesman said. ``Anyonetraveling on the roads this evening would be in a similar state.''   Transport Secretary Paul Channon said the strike was ``utterlyintolerable.'' He said the government would not get involved andurged all parties to seek independent arbitration.   Transit employees staged the walkout to press their demands forhigher wages. They threatened to hold another strike July 5.   Employers reported more workers reached their offices than onJan. 21, when London's bus drivers and conductors joined subway andrailroad employees in the earlier walkout.   The Confederation of British Industry estimated 75 percent ofLondon workers showed up at their jobs, compared with 60 percentlast week.   ``People were lulled into a false sense of security because thetraffic was so light last week, so more people have tried to get inthis time,'' said Jane Calvert-Lee, London regional director of theconfederation.   People have been leaving home as early as 4 a.m., she said.   London buses were crowded but operating normally and trafficcongestion was heavy. Extra buses were running from Heathrow andGatwick airports into the city, and special buses took thousands oftennis fans from central London's Victoria Station to Wimbledon insouthwest London.   A skeleton service of 26 trains was operating on three of thesubway system's 10 lines with workers who oppose the strikes.   Two businessmen, hoping to avoid the choked streets of London'sfinancial district, traveled instead on the less-congested RiverThames _ by water skis.   But their unconventional journey from Putney, south London, cameto an inauspicious end when river police told them that water skiingwas forbidden on the Thames.   ``When we stopped them they just sank into the water, suits andall, their bowlers bobbing off down the river,'' said Constable FredMinnie, one of two officers in the police boat which stopped thebusinessmen near Westminster Bridge.   ``It was quite a sight. They said they'd had a bit of troublegetting to work last week on the day of the strikes, so decided towater ski today and didn't realize it wasn't allowed.''   The River Bus Partnership, which operates river taxis on theThames, said it expected to carry 5,000 passengers, or five timesits normal load.   The Royal Mail said there would be some disruptions in servicebecause 70 percent of the country's mail is carried by trains. Itsaid extra trucks were rented to help the postal service's own34,000 vehicles.   The National Union of Railwaymen is striking to protest the 7percent wage hike offered its 75,000 members by British Rail.   The 10,500 subway workers want a $99 weekly increase to operatetrains without guards. Management is offering $46 plus 14 days extraannual vacation, but is tying the raise to increase productivity.   About 2.7 million passengers use the London Underground daily and2 million use rail services.</TEXT></DOC>
