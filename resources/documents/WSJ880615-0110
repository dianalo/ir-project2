The maker of computer-integrated manufacturing systems said net income rose to $8.9 million, or 47 cents a share, from the year-earlier $6 million, or 31 cents a share.    Revenue, helped by &quot;especially strong&quot; orders for pulp and paper manufacturing systems from Japan and Canada, grew to $65.8 million from $57.6 million.    Measurex said gross profit margins were &quot;returning to more normal levels&quot; from a year earlier, when they were depressed by costs associated with introducing a new product.    For the six months, net climbed 34% to $16.7 million, or 88 cents a share, from $12.5 million, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier. The company said net income for the six months ended May 31, 1987, includes a $1 million, or five cent-a-share, gain from the sale of securities. Revenue rose 17% to $127.8 million from $108.7 million.    &quot;Capital spending in the industries we serve remains strong, and we anticipate 1988 will be another record year,&quot; said David A. Bossen, president and chief executive officer, in a prepared release.    (Revised WSJ June 16, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
