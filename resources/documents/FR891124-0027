Susling, Acting AssistantDirector for Education Policy and Program Administration, Vocational Rehabilitationand Education Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, (202) 233-2092.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Department of Veterans Affairsand the Department of Defense are proposing to amend various regulationsand to add other regulations in order to implement several provisions ofPublic Law 100-689, the Veterans' Benefits and Programs Improvements Actof 1988, which affect VEAP. These provisions provide for cooperative trainingin VEAP; permit refresher and remedial training in that program; allowfor the payment of tutorial assistance to veterans enrolled under VEAP;provide that the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism will not be consideredto be the result of willful misconduct when the Department of VeteransAffairs determines whether or not veteran training in VEAP is entitledto an extension of the period of eligibility due to a disability; and providefor a reduction or termination of VEAP benefits when a veteran is incarcerateddue to conviction of a felony. The changes in law concerning willful misconductas to disabling effects of chronic alcoholism do not apply to the compensationand pension programs. The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense find thatgood cause exists for making the final amendments to andSection;andSection;21.5021 (t), (u) and (v), 21.5042, 21.5072(a), 21.5130, 21.5131 and 21.5296and the final new regulations andSection;andSection; 21.5072 (f) and (g), 21.5139,and 21.5141, like the sections of Public Law 100-689 they implement, retroactivelyeffective on November 18, 1988. The Department of Veterans Affairs andthe Department of Defense find that good cause exists for making andSection;21.5230(c), like the section of law it implements, effective on August15, 1989. The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defensefind that good cause exists for making the remainder of the regulations(other than andSection; 21.5021 (r) and (s) and andSection; 21.5230 (a) and(b)) retroactively effective on January 1, 1989. To achieve the maximumbenefit of the legislation for the affected individuals, it is necessaryto implement these provisions of law as soon as possible. A delayed effectivedate would be contrary to statutory design; would complicate administrationof these provisions of law; and might result in denial or improper paymentof a benefit to a veteran or servicemember. Moreover, the above sectionssimply interpret and implement statutory provisions.The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense have determinedthat these amended regulations do not contain a major rule as that termis defined by E.O. 12291, entitled Federal Regulation. The regulationswill not have a $100 million annual effect on the economy, and will notcause a major increase in costs or prices for anyone. They will have nosignificant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Defense certifythat these amended regulations, if promulgated, will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are definedin the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612. Pursuant to5 U.S.C. 605(b), the amended regulations, therefore, are exempt from theinitial and final regulatory flexibility analyses requirements of sections603 and 604.This certification can be made because the regulations affect only individuals.They will have no significant economic impact on small entities, i.e.,small businesses, small private and nonprofit organizations and small governmentaljurisdictions.<ITAG tagnum="21">The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number for the programaffected by this regulation is 64.120.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 21</ITAG>Civil rights, Claims, Education, Grant programs-education, Loan programs-education,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Schools, Veterans, Vocationaleducation, Vocational rehabilitation.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: August 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward J.
