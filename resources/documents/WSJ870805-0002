HudsonStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/05/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROPTELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><TEXT>   A West German commission report recommending a cautious first step away from monopoly control of German telecommunications is unlikely to satisfy the country's trading partners, but even this watered-down proposal is meeting potentially crippling domestic opposition.    A commission made up of representatives from trade unions, industry, government and major political parties prepared the report, which will be presented to Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Sept. 16. Implementation of its recommendations would require parliamentary approval.    The report recommends splitting the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, known as the Bundespost, into two sectors. Telecommunications would operate under a new company called Telekom, which would be run as an independent venture under the ministry helm. The other sector would assume the remaining functions of the current ministry, including postal service.    Telekom's managers wouldn't be exclusively civil servants, but rather would include recruits from the ranks of industry, proponents of hoped-for deregulation.    Under the proposals, Telekom would keep the Bundespost's present monopoly on telephone and network services. Only ancillary services, such as facsimile transmission, would be open to competition, domestic or foreign. One of the most tangible proposals is for consumer choice of telephone equipment for home installation.    Over the past few months, the U.S. and other critics have eased pressure for changes in the German telecommunications system, pending the commission's report. But with the publication of these recommendations -- which aren't likely to deliver far-reaching changes -- the pressure again may build.    U.S. officials had hoped for the proposed reform to include the unrestricted use of satellites and complete freedom to offer such network services as private electronic mail, video conferencing and computerized data bases.    The U.S. also has criticized Germany's complex and costly specifications for equipment such as telephone switchboards and modems as tantamount to trade barriers, an issue that wasn't dealt with in this report.    Some Free Democrats, who favor freemarket policies, criticized the report for not going far enough, emphasizing that about 95% of the revenue of the Bundespost would stay under the monopoly umbrella.    But even before their formal release, the proposals faced a storm of criticism for going too far. The postal trade union has condemned the proposed liberalization and warned of a job action. And the Social Democrats argue that big business will reap economic benefits from cheaper long-distance service, to the detriment of the consumer, who will pay more for services.    Another stumbling block to the implementation of deregulation is that the system as it exists is an important source of revenues for the government. The telecommunications sector of the Bundespost monopoly is a mammoth cash-generator that last year alone gave the government 4.7 billion marks ($2.51 billion), 1.7 billion marks of which was used to make up the deficits of the mail system.    With the government seeking financing for its tax reform -- a 56 billion-mark package that stretches from 1986 to the 1990s -- it is unlikely to press very adamantly for a restructuring of this cash cow.    &quot;Without the cross-subsidies between postal and telephone services, either the finance minister will have to assume the postal deficit or the people will have to accept a massive deterioration in postal services,&quot; said the secretary general of the Social Democrats, Peter Glotz, a commission member.    Multinational companies that want to sell telecommunications equipment and services in Germany said they aren't expecting sweeping, immediate changes to result from the report. Yet they hailed it as an important first step on a multi-year road toward loosening the Bundespost's monopoly.    &quot;I think there is a sensitivity in Germany that there's a need to liberalize&quot; telecommunications, said Robert Dalziel, head of the European operations of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. Although he doesn't expect quick results, Mr. Dalziel said that &quot;sometime in the 1990's people will look back on this report as the start&quot; of the process of deregulation.    Officials of Swedish communications-equipment maker Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson also expect a gradual progression toward liberalization. &quot;It really takes a long time,&quot; says Joachim Riediger, marketing manager in Germany for Ericsson. &quot;The Bundespost isn't ready to give away everything tomorrow.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
