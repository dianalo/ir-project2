Jackson rejected what he called ``material concessions'' toterrorists but did not rule out political accommodation. He alsosaid he could conceive of situations where he would grant safepassage to hostage-takers and added, ``I choose negotiation overblind bloody confrontation.''   ``If we are going to deter terrorism, we must address theunderlying causes of terrorism,'' he said after an appearance at ahigh school in Pittsburgh. ``Terrorism does not emerge out of theblue.''   The candidates agreed that in hostage situations, the governmentought to talk to people who could bring about the release ofpersons being held.   U.S. policy holds that American officials ``will talk to anyofficial or group about the safety and release of hostages but wewill not make concessions,'' according to the State Department.   But Jackson insisted, ``The fact is tha our government hastalked with terrorists and has negotiated, in some instancessuccessfully. It is good as a policy, but there must be alwaysflexibility in the policy. ... We ought to take every initiative wecan to gain the freedom of the American hostages in Beirut.''   Eight Americans are held hostage by Moslem extremists in Beirut.   The discussion of tactics for dealing with terrorists was anabrupt shift in a campaign debate which had been focused oneconomic issues, particularly how to assist Pennsylvania's ailingsteel industry.   Jackson wound up his Pennsylvania campaign in Philadelphia wherehe spoke to striking workers at a British Petroleum Corp. refinery,attended a reception with gay and lesbian activists and then held aget-out-the-vote rally.   At the refinery, he said the company's profits were up 400percent last year.   ``For profits to be up and wages down is greedy and unfair,'' hesaid.   He also linked the welfare of American workers to the status ofblacks in South Africa.   ``Steelworkers in Pennsylvania are in danger as long asironworkers in South Africa are enslaved,'' he said. Referring toimprisoned South African black leader Nelson Mandela, Jackson said,``Until Mandela is free, you will not be free.''   Dukakis was aiming for his fourth straight primary victory in acontest with 178 delegates at stake.   Vice President George Bush, who could clinch a conventionmajority with a victory in Pennsylvania, compared his campaignrebirth after an Iowa caucus defeat to the revival of Pittsburgh, aonce-strapped steel town.   ``I know what it's like to be knocked to the canvas,'' he said,adding that his political comeback was ``a parallel to what youdemonstrated here.''   The latest Associated Press delegate count gave Bush 1,081 _ 58short of the 1,139 needed for the nomination at the GOP conventionnext August. His only remaining rival, former television evangelistPat Robertson, has 31 delegates.   On the Democratic side, Dukakis was more than half way toward adelegate majority, holding 1,075.15 national convention votes.Jackson has 836.1 while 599.75 were uncommitted. A tally of 2,081or more is needed to win the nomination at the July convention inAtlanta.   Dukakis' strong victory in the New York primary last week madehim the prohibitive favorite to emerge as the Democraticpresidential nominee.   A new poll sponsored by Philadelphia's KYW-TV and Pittsburgh'sKDKA-TV indicated a big Dukakis win here, with the Massachusettsgovernor the choice of 57 percent of the likely Democratic voterssurveyed compared to 31 percent for Jackson.   Dukakis, meanwhile, won a large majority of the 23 delegates atstake in caucuses Monday night in Utah. With 46 percent of thestate's legislative districts reporting, Dukakis had 71 percent ofthe vote to Jackson's 19 percent.   The flap over how to deal with terrorists began on Sunday whenJackson took issue with Dukakis' position.   ``I've raised the point in several debates this year,'' saidJackson ``Every time a question comes up about terrorism, Mr.Dukakis says, `I'm against terrorism. ... We should not negotiatewith terrorists. ... In the Middle East, never negotiate withterrorists.'   ``I disagree with that; If I could get the hostages out, I'd doit.''   When Dukakis was asked Monday about the Jackson statement, hesaid, ``I think we need a tough anti-terrorist policy.   ``I don't have a problem with talking, but you never makeconcessions to terrorists _ ever. If you do, what you end up withis hostage-taking and terrorism all over the world.''   Jackson said that as president he would not talk directly toterrorists because ``it would effectively raise the status of theterrorists and that would be a stimulus and that should nothappen.''   He went on to say that ``talk does not mean materialconcessions.''   He said, ``I would never, never exchange arms for hostages,'' areference to the secret arms sales to Iran by the Reaganadministration. ``That was a fundamental mistake.''   Asked what he meant by material concessions, Jackson said,``Well, you're giving something physical. The first principle isthat we should not jeopardize our national interests or nationalsecurity.''   Pressed on whether he would exchange political prisoners forhostages, Jackson said, ``Well, the other government must make thatjudgment. They must weigh their political circumstances, they mustdetermine the consequences of such an act. Every plea bargainsituation or right of safe passage situation must be weighed on itsown merits.''   Meanwhile, a Gallup poll released Monday evening had Bush andDukakis virtually tied in a head-to-head race, with Bush doingbetter with the addition of Rep. Jack Kemp as a running mate andDukakis a bit worse if he ran with Jackson.   Bush had 45 percent support to 43 percent for Dukakis, with 12percent undecided or favoring someone else. A Bush-Kemp ticket wonthe support of 50 percent, against 40 percent for a Dukakis-Jacksonticket, with 10 percent in the other-undecided category.   With Jackson as the Democratic presidential nominee, the resultwas Bush 60 percent, Jackson 25, other-undecided 15. Gallupsurveyed 1,204 registered voters April 21-23; the poll had a marginof sampling error of 3 points.   Among the 540 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents inthe poll, 66 percent favored Dukakis as the party's nominee to 22percent who wanted Jackson and 12 percent other-undecided. Abouttwo-thirds of Jackson's support was strong, compared to one-thirdof Dukakis' support.</TEXT></DOC>
