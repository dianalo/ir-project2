The South African Council of Churches, which includes almost allleading Protestant denominations, said it backed a plan for ailingblacks to seek treatment at ``whites only'' hospitals beginningWednesday.   The civil disobedience campaign is expected to include othertactics and to intensify in the days leading up to the segregatedparliamentary elections Sept. 6. South Africa's tricameralParliament has houses for whites, Asians and people of mixed-race,but excludes the 28 million black majority.   ``Elections in South Africa have become synonymous with theperpetuation of apartheid and discrimination,'' said Frank Chikane,general secretary of the council of churches.   ``The only means that remain open to the voteless majority is toembark on a program of peaceful, non-violent defiance that willchange these laws,'' Chikane said.   His statement was endorsed by nine prominent church officials,including Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984Nobel Peace Prize.   ``We call on all participants ... to act with discipline andrestraint that such a campaign deserves in order to retain themoral high ground,'' Chikane said.   ``We are seriously concerned at the repressive action which (Lawand Order Minister Adriaan) Vlok has threatened to use,'' he said.   Vlok has said the campaign is part of an attempt to disrupt theelections with violence. Such actions, he said, must be stopped``at all costs.''   There have been several bombings in the past week, and policesaid the three people who were killed had been planting theexplosives. On Monday night, gunmen opened fire and tossed a handgrenade at a Johannesburg police station, but no one was injured.   No one has claimed responsibility for the violence. Police blamemost such attacks on the outlawed African National Congressguerrilla group.   The Mass Democratic Movement, a loose coalition ofanti-apartheid groups that organized the defiance campaign, saidanti-black leaflets that had been circulating in recent days``could be the work of the government so as to instill a climate ofviolence around a non-violent action.''   One organizer, Cas Coovadia, said no more than 50 blacks wereexpected to present themselves Wednesday at any one of the eightwhite hospitals targeted by the movement. Government officials havesaid blacks who arrive at ``whites only'' hospitals and are not inneed of emergency treatment will be referred to ``black'' hospitals.   People entering hospitals without permission could face jailterms of up to two years, according to a government directiveissued last week.   The Mass Democratic Movement has no official structure oracknowledged leader, but is made up of some of the same people whoheaded the United Democratic Front until it was banned last year.</TEXT></DOC>
