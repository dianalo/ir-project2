Any other place, they'd put a mint on your pillow. InPaisley, a dinky town in southeastern Oregon, an offer tospray you is a show of hospitality.</LP><TEXT>   Paisley rolled out the red carpet recently for severalthousand people who (1) managed to find the town on the map;and (2) stayed long enough to learn what a mosquito festivalis.   A mosquito festival is . . . well, it's something thatwould put Tom Sawyer to shame. You may recall that clever Tomgot out of painting the fence himself. Now that was just oneday. The people of Paisley have been carrying out their rusefor seven years.   Since 1984, at the height of what is recognized as theworst mosquito infestation in Oregon, the Paisleyites (all345 of them) have proclaimed their annual Mosquito Festival.   Each year more suckers, er, visitors, pour into town on ahot summer weekend to attend the coronation of Ms. Quito,watch the Mosquito Festival parade, buy souvenir T-shirts andspend money at events such as the horseshoe tournament,tomahawk-throwing contest and chicken-poop lotto.   After the out-of-towners leave Paisley, with their walletsconsiderably lighter, the denizens count their take and putin a big order for mosquito spray. Then, for the rest of theyear, they live in relative comfort, free of the legendaryclouds of mosquitoes that some folks remember frompre-festival days.   Why, it used to be so bad that Bob Rutledge's horses lostabout 200 pounds a year, just trying to run away from themosquitoes. Thanks to the Mosquito Festival, he said, thehorses now lose only 20 pounds.   &quot;You could ride a white horse out into the marsh andpretty soon it would be brown and then {shudder} red,&quot; hesaid.   Pre-festival mosquitoes &quot;reduced visibility,&quot; according toBeverly Hills, the 1984 Ms. Quito. And Pam Forga, the 1987Ms. Quito, said nobody went out at night, but if they had to,they covered as much skin as they could and didn't open theirmouths, for fear of swallowing mosquitoes.   To add insult to injury for Paisley teenagers, the placeone was most likely to be bitten was Lovers' Lane, a gravelroad that extends into the soggy marshlands that surround thetown. Never daring to bare their flesh or open their mouths,young lovers could sit in their cars and watch cattle inneighboring fields being stampeded by swarms of mosquitoes.   Until they hatched the idea of a Mosquito Festival, thePaisleyites tried many solutions. Aerial sprays just blewaway, and electric bug zappers, which they attached to nearlyevery telephone pole in town, kept folks awake with constantbug electrocutions. Besides that, mosquitoes weren'tattracted to the zappers' light.   About a zillion other bugs were, and their zapped corpsescreated huge mounds on the sidewalk at the base of everytelephone pole. The dead bugs attracted a nightly parade ofskunks, but darned if the people of Paisley were going tothrow a Skunk Festival, too.   But this Mosquito Festival notion has been working justfine. The first festival raised enough money to buy a mobilesprayer, and enough spray to douse the town a couple oftimes. Relief was in sight.   The festival proceeds get a little higher each year, sothat these days the town can afford to spray once or twice aweek during the summer. This year's take, for example, waswell over $20,000.   Mosquitoes beware.   Regular spraying plus unusually dry weather kept themosquitoes at bay during the 1990 Mosquito Festival. But justin case, Paisley Mercantile had stocked up on &quot;skeeter dope,&quot;and the folks who rode in the parade (mostly people dressedup as mosquitoes) threw insect swatters to the crowd.   Before the parade began, the 1990 Ms. Quito was crowned inthe shadow of the town's giant mosquito statue. JoAnn Solheimwas all aquiver at the honor, but one got the impressionthat, sooner or later, every female in Paisley would becomeMs. Quito.   The 1989 Ms. Quito, Cindy Vickerman, admitted that bearingthe title for an entire year had not boosted her prestige.&quot;People laugh at me,&quot; she said. As for her official duties:&quot;Shoot, I can't think of anything.&quot;   According to mosquito experts, there are at least 15varieties of mosquitoes breeding in the marshlands aroundPaisley. Cattle ranchers flood-irrigate their hay fieldsevery summer, and the mosquitoes move right in.   The Paisleyites have been told that the only comparablemosquito population in the U.S. is in Alaska, but theoccasional Alaskan visitor to Paisley is said to leave in ahurry, eager to get home to where the mosquitoes just nibble,and don't take a pound (or two, or 200) of flesh.   Thanks to the Mosquito Festival, clouds of ravenousinsects swarming through town are becoming a distant memory.They'll stay that way, too, as long as people are justitching to come to Paisley every year to help celebrate ascourge.   ---   Ms. Hauser is a free-lance writer based in Portland, Ore.</TEXT></DOC>
