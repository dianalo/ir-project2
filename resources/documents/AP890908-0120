The order came after the missionary, Richard Hamilton, wasinterrogated Friday about a recent meeting with a controversialKenyan bishop who accuses government officials of corruption andincreasing authoritarianism.   Immigration officer Frank Kwinga refused to say whether thatmeeting sparked Hamilton's expulsion but said the 51-year-olddirector of the East African Christian Mission in Kenya ``will berequired to go.''   Kwinga said Hamilton and his wife, Jane, should have left thecountry in July 1988 when their mission was de-registered. He wouldnot say when Hamilton would be required to leave or whether theorder also applies to his wife.   All organizations have to be registered in Kenya, a one-partystate where the Hamiltons have worked 15 years amongpoverty-stricken peasants.   In November 1987, the Hamiltons were threatened with deportationafter the government accused them of involvement with an allegedplot to oust President Daniel arap Moi. Seven other Americanmissionaries were deported before the ``plot'' was found to be abaseless story engineered by a disgruntled Kenyan-born priest livingin the United States.   A year earlier, the Kenyans detained two Americans on Hamilton'smission on charges they tried to import guns and radio transmitters.One of the detained missionaries, Lyle Hutson, 63, also fromMedford, had a heart attack and died in police custody.   The mission said the suspect shipment were air rifles and pistolsand that the radios were needed for communication.   Mrs. Hamilton, in a telephone interview from her home in westernKitale town, said her husband is being used as a scapegoat in thedispute.   She said their work permits were invalidated when the mission wasde-registered but that they received verbal assurances fromofficials they could continue their development work in the aridWest Pokot region while authorities considered an appeal of the ban.   ``We assumed we were okay,'' said Mrs. Hamilton.   However, Hamilton on Thursday night was ordered to accompanycriminal investigators to Nairobi.   Mrs. Hamilton said her husband spent Friday being interrogated byofficers who asked him repeatedly about a Sept. 1 meeting withBishop Alexander Muge, who repeatedly has criticized Moi'sgovernment.   She said their mission was banned last year after a localofficial, who believed them involved with his political enemies,complained to authorities their organization somehow was involved inMuge's claims that people were starving in West Pokot. The chargesembarrassed the government.   The meeting Sept. 1 was to discuss whether Muge's church wouldact as an umbrella organization under which the Hamilton missioncould be re-registered, Mrs. Hamilton said.   She said the couple did not know Muge prior to the meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
