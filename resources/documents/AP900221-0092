(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Police stalking a bank robber whopreferred certain bank branches correctly predicted where the thiefwould strike next and nabbed a suspect emerging from a bank after aholdup.   Allen Lorenzo Mills, 34, of Capitol Heights, was charged witharmed robbery and assault with intent to rob after he tried toleave a Sovran bank branch Tuesday.   Police said a man who had become known as the ``bearded bankrobber'' seemed to prefer Sovran Bank branches, striking threetimes at one branch and once previously at the Bladensburg branchthat was held up Tuesday.   Police guessed the robber might return to the Bladensburg branchbecause his robbery there had been among the most lucrative, andset up a stakeout.   Shortly after noon, a man who resembled photographs obtainedduring other bank robberies entered the bank, police said. Withinseconds, a special alarm in the bank alerted authorities that arobbery was in progress.   Undercover officers met the man as he walked out the door andarrested him without incident, police said.   ``We've had several banks under surveillance over the last twoweeks, but today, this was the only bank we were watching,'' saidMaj. Tony Leo, commander of the Special Operations Division. ``Theofficers figured he would come back to this branch sooner or laterand he did.''   Police are investigating whether Mills is connected to at leastsix other robberies committed in the past two months, includinganother Tuesday in District Heights.</TEXT></DOC>
