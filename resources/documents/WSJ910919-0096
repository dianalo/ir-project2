More than one-third of 1,150 companies recently surveyedsaid they had terminated or downgraded a banking relationshipbecause of the financial condition of the bank, according toa study soon to be sent to participants by GreenwichAssociates. Almost as many said they had established a formalpolicy for doing business with banks based on their creditrating.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. banks are also paying the price for increasing theirprofit margins on corporate loans in the first half,according to another study, now in draft form, by LoanPricing Corp. The New York loan monitoring service said U.S.banks have been hurt because companies often seek out lowerrates charged by insurance companies for private placementswhen rolling over a maturing bank loan.   In the Greenwich Associates study, &quot;The number ofcompanies indicating they are penalizing weak banks is high,&quot;said Alan Munro, a partner of the Connecticut firm whichconducts an annual survey of corporate banking and investmentbanking relationships. That was a driving factor behind thesurvey's finding that large companies increased their use offoreign banks to 7.4 from 5.7, on average, and cut backrelationships with U.S. banks to an average of 8.7 from 10.3over the past two years. To an even greater degree, companieswith annual sales exceeding $5 billion increased their use offoreign banks and dropped U.S. banks.   Many of the changes stem from concern about thereliability of the U.S. banks as a source of credit. Thatreason showed the biggest rise when companies were asked whythey changed banks, rising to 57% in the new survey from 51%in a survey two years ago. It's also a sign of currentbanking conditions, with many banks either weakened by badloans or wary about making new loans. The bankingrelationships discussed in the survey covered a broad rangeof activities, including lending, cash management and accessto capital markets.   Most of the banks that lost business because of theirfinancial condition (84%) were U.S. banks, the survey showed.Of those, twice as many were money-center banks as regionalbanks. When it came to gaining business because of financialcondition, almost as many regional banks (28%) got a piece ofthe action as did money-center banks (32%).   At the same time, only 4% of the banks that lost businessbecause of financial condition were foreign banks. And, ingaining a share of business, Swiss banks were the beneficiaryby a margin of better than 2-to-1 over other foreigncountries.   The main reasons cited for moving to a foreign bank werefinancial strength, followed by categories that showed a moreaggressive attitude toward making loans at rates and termsthe companies liked.   While the total number of banks the survey participantsused did not change year-to-year, those banks the companiesconsidered their &quot;principal&quot; banks did show a downturn, to6.9 this year from 7.2 in each of the past two years. Thismeans that companies are concentrating the lion's share oftheir business with fewer banks.   Greenwich Associates' findings on concentration coincidewith corporate banking relationship studies regularly done byGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co. banking analyst Robert Albertson. But heexpects the trend could be ripe for a reversal. &quot;At somepoint those customers who still have a need for credit aregoing to run out of ancillary business, such as trust, cashmanagement and advisory, to help compensate their lendingbanks,&quot; Mr. Albertson said.   &quot;This means one of two things -- either increase thenumber of relationships or pay much more in the unbundledsense for credit,&quot; Mr. Albertson added. Pricing for loans, hebelieves, is still inadequate for the risk despite havingrisen sharply over the past year.   That richer pricing has already driven some business intothe arms of U.S. insurance companies, notes ChristopherSnyder, president of Loan Pricing Corp. Of the $42 billion inlarge corporate bank loans maturing this year, about $8billion is expected to end up in private placements held ininsurance company portfolios rather than as a new bank loan,he said.   While some of that rollover typically moves into thelonger-term fixed-rate insurance market, the banks lost muchof it when they widened the interest rate margins betweentheir loans and five-year Treasury notes to historic highsearlier this year, Mr. Snyder said.   Those wider spreads made private placement rates, whichare priced off Treasury rates, more attractive. Insurancecompanies are eager for the business, Mr. Snyder said, sincethey prefer strong corporate loans in their portfolios to newcommercial real estate mortgages.   Banks have been more competitive of late, Mr. Snyderadded. They need to be. About $68 billion of corporate loansmade in the late 1980s matures in 1992 and 1993, the firm'ssoon-to-be released report says. &quot;Insurance companies couldabsorb up to $20 billion of higher-quality loans&quot; from thebanks, the report adds.   The bright side for banks, Mr. Snyder said, is that theycould roll over many of the loans at more profitable spreadsbecause insurance companies are restricted from lending moneyto all but top-rated companies.</TEXT></DOC>
