Abitibi, the second-largest newsprint producer in theworld, said members of the Canadian Paperworkers Union voted77% in favor of a strike if agreement isn't reached beforethe deadline.</LP><TEXT>   The company said negotiations with the union will resumehere Sept. 7. Talks were suspended Aug. 20 so that the unioncould take a strike vote.   A strike would close most of Abitibi's newsprint mills,which are concentrated in Eastern Canada. Abitibi has totalannual newsprint capacity of about 1.95 million metric tons,or about 8% of North American capacity. A metric ton equalsabout 2,204.62 pounds.   A strike wouldn't have an immediate impact on newspaperpublishers and other newsprint users. Publishers of U.S.daily newspapers had an average 41-day supply of newsprint onhand at the end of July. As well, other newsprint makers canboost their output in the event of a strike. But supplies arealready fairly tight and a strike at Abitibi would put upwardpressure on prices, newsprint buyers said.   An Abitibi spokeswoman said that when talks were suspendedonly minor issues had been settled. &quot;We're very early in thenegotiations process,&quot; the official said.   The union declined to comment until it notifies itsmembers, but a union official confirmed the vote results andstrike deadline.</TEXT></DOC>
