Background</ITAG>On November 8, 1985, EPA proposed to amend its regulations under RCRA toremove iron dextran from 40 CFR 261.33, the list of commercial chemicalproducts which are hazardous wastes when discarded or intended to be discarded;and to remove iron dextran from Appendix VIII of Part 261, the list ofRCRA hazardous constituents (50 FR 46468). EPA also proposed to removeiron dextran from the CERCLA list of hazardous substances. This proposalresponded to an August 9, 1983, petition submitted by Fisons Corporationpursuant to andSection; 260.20 to delist iron dextran.The Agency originally listed iron dextran in 40 CFR 261.33(f) (EPA HazardousWaste No. U139) and Appendix VIII based upon the listing criteria in 40CFR 261.11(a)(3)(i)-(xi) and the Agency's Carcinogen Assessment Group (CAG)assessment that iron dextran exhibited sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity.Iron dextran has been designated as a Class B2 carcinogen by CAG accordingto EPA's Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (51 FR 33992) basedupon sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals, but inadequatedata in humans. A further review of the evidence for the carcinogenicitydextran reveals that it is limited to studies in which iron dextran wasgiven to experimental animals by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection;in addition, there is no evidence that iron dextran is carcinogenic whenorally or otherwise administered. Furthermore, the large size of the irondextran complex (molecular weight approximately 180,000) \1\<NOTE/> prevents its absorption by the oral, dermal, or inhalationroutes. In fact, dextran, to which the iron is complexed, is a large polysaccharide(molecular weight 40,000_75,000) that is commonly used parenterally (nonintestinally)as a plasma expander. By definition, plasma expanders have an osmotic pressurecomparable to plasma, preventing them from crossing membrane barriers,and thereby effectively prohibiting their absorption from the circulatorysystem.\2\<NOTE/> Since they cannot cross membrane barriers, they cannot beabsorbed by the oral, dermal, or inhalation routes. Iron dextran is muchlarger than dextran; thus, it too will not be absorbed. Therefore, EPAnow concludes that iron dextran, when discarded, does not pose a significanthazard to human health or the environment because iron dextran, due toits size, stability, and osmotic pressure, is not absorbed by the oral,dermal, or inhalation routes, and exposure via subcutaneous or intramuscularinjection at levels of concern is not a likely mismanagement scenario.Accordingly, iron dextran also does not meet the standard for listing ahazardous constituent on Appendix VIII of Part 261 set forth at andSection;261.11(a). That section provides for listing in Appendix VIII only if aconstituent has been shown in scientific studies to have toxic, carcinogenic,mutagenic, or teratogenic effects on human or other life forms. Applyingthis standard in the context of Subtitle C, that is, to protect human healthand the environment from the risks of improper hazardous waste management,EPA concludes that the available scientific studies, which address carcinogeniceffects of subcutaneous injection of iron dextran, when viewed in lightof the lack of absorption of iron dextran via oral, dermal, and inhalationroutes, do not demonstrate carcinogenic effects as a result of a plausiblemismanagement scenario. Similarly, iron dextran also does not meet thestandard for listing of a hazardous waste set forth at andSection; 261.11(a)(3).Again, because iron dextran cannot be absorbed by the oral, dermal, orinhalation routes, it is not ``capable of posing a substantial presentor potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperlytreated, stored, transported, disposed of, or otherwise managed.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Lundin, P.M. 1961.

Response to Comments</ITAG>EPA received comments from the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)in response to the proposed rulemaking. The NRDC presented the followingarguments: (1) Sufficient evidence exists of carcinogenicity in experimentalanimals by the injection route indicating the potential to cause tumorsby other routes of exposure including ingestion, (2) suggestive evidenceexists in rodents that iron dextran can induce tumors at distal sites,and (3) there are case reports in the literature of injection site tumorsin humans. These arguments are discussed below in more detail.1. The commenter states that ``the sufficient evidence of carcinogenicityin experimental animals by the injection route indicates the potentialto cause tumors by other routes of exposure, including ingestion.'' Thecommenter states that iron dextran has not been adequately tested by otherroutes of administration and that in the absence of such data, ``a prudentapproach is to assume that iron dextran is potentially carcinogenic inhumans by the oral or inhalation routes.'' In support of this, the commentercites an analysis of the literature that found that of 102 chemicals reviewed,only 8.7% that were positive for carcinogenicity by a subcutaneous routewere negative when tested by other routes.The Agency agrees that other routes are potential pathways for carcinogenicityif one route has shown to be carcinogenic. However, iron dextran, becauseof its size, stability and osmotic pressure is unlikely to be absorbedby any route of exposure other than subcutaneous or intramuscular injection.Accordingly, it could not pose a significant hazard to human health orthe environment through these other routes of exposure.2. The commenter states ``there is, in fact, some suggestive evidence inrodents that iron dextran can induce tumors at distal sites.'' The commentercites, in support of this contention, one subcutaneous injection studyin rats where distal tumors were elevated by 6.3% over a control incidenceof 7.8% in one of four treatment groups.The Agency has reviewed these data and does not deem this positive evidence.The increased incidence was not dose-related, it was only seen in one group,and was not statistically significant. We concluded, therefore, that theincidence of distal tumors found in this study does not provide positiveevidence of carcinogenicity.3. The commenter cites another study in mice that discussed the possibilitythat iron dextran may act as a co-carcinogenic factor in the case of lymphoreticularneoplasms, increasing host susceptibility to the oncogenic virus possiblypresent in both test and control animals.The Agency does not believe that this study provides conclusive evidenceof carcinogenic effects; rather the Agency regards such evidence as speculation.Therefore, this suggestive result is not a significant toxic effect.4. The commenter claims ``further evidence of iron dextran's carcinogenicityis provided by very recent experiments in which iron dextran was injectedin mice implanted with L1210 cell line inoculates. In these experiments,the L1210 cell line acted as a potential tumor analogue. Iron dextran notonly accelerated proliferation of the L1210 cells, but also significantlyincreased the lethality of these cells. This provided further evidencethat iron overload is carcinogenic not only at the site of entry but systemicallyas well.''The Agency agrees that iron overload is correlated with carcinogenicity.The studies cited by the commenter presented evidence of a high incidenceof lung cancer in hematite (iron ore) miners, hepatomas in gold minersdue to the excessive oral ingestion of iron-contaminated beer, and gastriccancer in people with occupations exposed to iron dust, all associatedwith hemochromatosis, a disorder of iron metabolism. However, the EPA doesnot believe that the above-cited studies provide evidence of iron dextran-inducediron overload because iron dextran cannot be absorbed by any route otherthan subcutaneous, nor is there evidence that subcutaneous exposure willresult in concentrations of iron dextran high enough to induce iron overload-associatedcancer at distal sites.5. The commenter states ``there have been a number of case reports in theliterature of tumors at the injection site in humans.'' Specifically, thecommenter cites eight cases of sarcomas that have followed intramuscularinjection of iron compounds. The Agency believes that these studies are of questionable value. All ofthe studies involved tumors or lesions at the site of injection. The Agencypromulgated a policy on September 24, 1986, on how to deal with tumorsat the site of injection in the <T3>Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment </T3>(51 FR 33992). Theseguidelines state that tumors at the site of injection alone are ``limited''evidence of the carcinogenicity of a compound. Furthermore, three of thestudies involved the injection of Jectofer, an iron sorbitol and citricacid complex, rather than iron dextran, and therefore any conclusion drawnfrom these studies about the carcinogenicity of iron dextran is questionable.In summary, the Agency is issuing a final rule to remove iron dextran fromthe list of hazardous wastes on the grounds that, because of its size,it does not present a carcinogenic risk to humans by any route of exposureother than possible subcutaneous. Exposure via subcutaneous or intramuscularexposure at levels of concern, however, is not a plausible mismangementscenario. Multiple doses of milliliter quantities of iron dextran needto be injected into the system to possibly cause a detrimental effect.This is a highly unlikely mismanagement scenario. There are no other knownreasons to list iron dextran.Iron dextran is not absorbed by oral, dermal, or inhalation routes. Itis a drug that is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration for non-intestinaluse only. All of the animal and human data cited by the commenter as supportiveevidence of systemic carcinogenicity have been reviewed by the Agency,and are regarded as being inadequate, inconclusive, or speculative.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Relationship to Other Regulatory Authorities</ITAG>Whenever a hazardous waste or waste stream is listed under section 3001of RCRA, it is co-listed as a hazardous substance under the statutory provisionsof section 101(14) of CERCLA. The Agency, in its April 4, 1985, final ruleon notification requirements and reportable quantity (RQ) adjustments,noted that iron dextran, along with numerous other elements, compounds,mixtures, solutions, and hazardous wastes, was designated as a hazardoussubstance under section 102(a) of CERCLA. (See 50 FR 13456.)In addition to amending the RCRA regulations to remove iron dextran from40 CFR 261.33(f) and 40 CFR Part 261, Appendix VIII, the Agency is todayremoving iron dextran from the CERCLA section 102(a) list of hazardoussubstances. As a result of the removal of iron dextran from the andSection;261.33(f) and Part 261 Appendix VIII lists, the Agency has no basis uponwhich to retain iron dextran on the CERCLA section 102(a) list of hazardoussubstances. The Agency's designation of iron dextran under section 102(a)was based solely upon its inclusion as a hazardous substance under section101(14) of CERCLA. The Agency has previously stated that when hazardoussubstances are added to or removed from the lists which comprise the CERCLAsection 101(14) list of hazardous substances, corresponding changes willbe made simultaneously both to the list of hazardous substances in section101(14) and the list of CERCLA hazardous substances designated under section102(a) and published in 40 CFR Table 302.4. (See 48 FR 23552, 23554 (May25, 1983 proposed rule); Technical Background Document to Support RulemakingPursuant to CERCLA Section 102 (Volume 1, March 1985) at ES-4.)Although iron dextran is today being removed from the CERCLA andSection;102(a) list, wastes containing iron dextran may, in certain circumstances,be hazardous substances under section 102(a). Wastes containing iron dextranwhich exhibit any of the hazardous characteristics identified in 40 CFR261.20 through 261.40, are CERCLA hazardous substances under section 101(14)and are designated as section 102(a) CERCLA hazardous substances. All unlistedhazardous substances have a reportable quantity of 100 pounds under 40CFR 302.5(b).<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. State Authority</ITAG>A. <T3>Applicability of Rules in Authorized States</T3>Under section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administerand enforce the RCRA program within the State. (See 40 CFR Part 271 forthe standards and requirements for authorization.) Following authorization,EPA retains enforcement authority under sections 3008, 7003 and 3013 ofRCRA, although authorized States have primary enforcement responsibility.Prior to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), a Statewith final authorization administered its hazardous waste program entirelyin lieu of EPA administering the Federal program in that State. The Federalrequirements no longer applied in the authorized State, and EPA could notissue permits for any facilities in the State which the State was authorizedto permit. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgatedor enacted, the State was obliged to enact equivalent authority withinspecified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect inan authorized State until the State adopted the requirements as State law.In contrast, under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), new requirementsand prohibitions imposed by the HSWA take effect in authorized States atthe same time that they take effect in non-authorized States. EPA is directedto implement those requirements and prohibitions in authorized States,including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorizationto do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as Statelaw to retain final authorization, the HSWA applies in authorized Statesin the interim.<T3>B. Effect on State Authorizations</T3>Today's rule promulgates regulations that are not effective in authorizedStates since the regulations are not being imposed pursuant to the Hazardousand Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. Thus, the regulations will be applicableonly in those States that do not have interim or final authorization. Inauthorized States, the regulations will not be applicable until the Staterevises its program to adopt equivalent regulations under State law.40 CFR 271.21(e)(2) requires that States that have final authorizationmust modify their programs to include equivalent regulations within a yearof promulgation of these regulations if only regulatory changes are necessary,or within two years of promulgation if statutory changes are necessary.These deadlines can be extended in exceptional cases (40 CFR 271.21(e)(3)).Once EPA approves the modification, the State requirements become SubtitleC RCRA requirements.It should be noted that authorized States are only required to modify theirprograms when EPA promulgates Federal regulations that are more stringentor broader in scope than the existing Federal regulations. For those Federalprogram changes that are less stringent or reduce the scope of the Federalprogram, States are not required to modify their programs. This is a resultof section 3009 of RCRA, which allows States to impose regulations in additionto those in the Federal program. The regulations promulgated today at andSection;andSection;261.33(f) and 302.4 are considered to reduce the scope of the existingFederal regulations. Therefore, authorized States are not required to modifytheir programs to adopt regulations equivalent or substantially equivalentto the provisions listed above.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Effective Date</ITAG>This rule is effective immediately. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendmentsof 1984 amended section 3010 of RCRA to allow rules to become effectivein less than six months when the regulated community does not need thesix month period to come into compliance. This is the case here since thisrule reduces, rather than increases, the existing requirements for personsgenerating hazardous wastes. In light of the unnecessary hardship and expensewhich would be imposed on the petitioner by an effective date six monthsafter promulgation and the fact that such a deadline is not necessary toachieve the purpose of section 3010, this rule is effective immediately.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Impact</ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.This rule reduces the regulatory requirements applicable to the regulatedcommunity. It is not major because it would not result in an effect onthe economy of $100 million or more, nor would it result in a major increasein costs or prices to individual industries, consumers, Federal, Stateor local government agencies, or geographic regions. Finally, there wouldbe no adverse impact on competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. Accordingly, this amendmentis not a major regulation, and no Regulatory Impact Analysis has been conducted.This amendment was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for review as required by Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, wheneveran agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking, for anyproposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public commenta regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the ruleon small entities (<T3>i.e., </T3>small business, small organizations, and small governmentaljurisdictions). The Administrator may certify, however, that the rule willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.This amendment will not have a significant economic impact on small entitiessince it reduces regulatory requirements. Moreover, relatively few smallentities dispose of iron dextran. Accordingly, I certify that this finalrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. This regulation, therefore, does not require a regulatoryflexibility analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This final rule does not contain any information collection requirementssubject to OMB review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>40 CFR Part 261Hazardous wastes, Recycling.40 CFR Part 302Air pollution control, Chemicals, Hazardous materials, Hazardous substance,Hazardous wastes, Intergovernmental relations, Natural resources, Nuclearmaterials, Pesticides and pests, Radioactive materials, Recycling, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements, Superfund, Waste treatment and disposal,Water pollution control.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: October 21, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John A.
