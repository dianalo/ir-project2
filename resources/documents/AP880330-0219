The letter, which began appearing in Chinese-language newspaperson Tuesday and Wednesday, said the policy would be detrimental toChina's drive to develop its economy.   It also said the policy would force many Chinese students inAmerica to return home before obtaining their degrees.   An American China expert linked the policy change to concerns inBeijing that Chinese students studying in the United States arebecoming too Westernized.   The letter echoed an earlier petition, signed by 1,000 Chinesestudents and sent to Beijing in January 1987. That letter opposedconservative political policies in China.   ``We are only asking that the right to study and complete ourdegrees be restored to us,'' said Pei Minxin, a 30-year-olddoctoral candidate at Harvard University. Pei was one of 21 Chinese``coordinators'' who included their telephone numbers in theletter, inviting students who supported their position to call inand add their name to the list.   So far, he said, more than 800 Chinese students nationwide hadcontacted the coordinators and pledged to sign the new letter,which will be sent to Beijing soon.   ``We are not planning to use this movement as an excuse to stayhere permanently,'' said Pei, whose request last week to extend hispassport was denied by Chinese authorities. ``We just want tofinish our degrees and go back to China.''   Currently, about 40,000 Chinese students are studying outside ofChina, 27,000 of them in the United States.   Under the new education policy, China will send only 3,000students abroad this year, the overseas edition of the People'sDaily reported Feb. 15.   Student sources in New York said Chinese officials told themonly 20 percent, or 600, would be sent to the United States. Lastyear, 8,000 Chinese students came to America.   The policy also calls for strict limits on how long Chinesestudents can stay abroad, according to a copy of an officialdocument obtained from Chinese sources in New York.   The document says students seeking a master's degree mustcomplete it within one or two years, and students working for adoctorate have only five years to finish it.   That rule could be particularly onerous for many Chinese, whocome to the United States needing time to improve their English.   Zheng Wanzhen, press councilor for the Chinese Embassy inWashington, acknowledged that fewer students would be sent abroadbut denied there was a policy change.   ``It's just that they have been sending too many students toAmerica,'' he said. China will send students to other countrieslike the Soviet Union, East Germany, Japan and Western Europe, hesaid.   Merle Goldman, a professor of history at Boston University, saidthe policy change marked a shift away from the liberal slant ofChinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who opened the country to the West inthe 1970s.   ``Not many students are returning to China and the Chinese wantthem back,'' she said.The Feb. 15 People's Daily said of the 36,000Chinese who have come to America, only 8,817 have returned.   In addition, Ms. Goldman said, when they do come home ``they arealready infected by the political values of the United States. Theyabsorb Western political ideas and that could be troublesome forthe Chinese state.''   Ms. Goldman said Premier Li Peng was responsible for the shift,which began last year when he took over as acting premier.</TEXT></DOC>
