Because of a major network modernization program, ATandamp;T said it is studying whether to write off or accelerate depreciation of $4 billion to $5 billion of network assets that will become obsolete. ATandamp;T plans to make 100% of its so-called domestic, switched traffic operate on digital facilities by the end of 1990. A full write-off could wipe out any earnings for the year, but analysts said taking the big expense now would greatly improve ATandamp;T's earnings in future years.    ATandamp;T executives said the company could choose to write off only part of the assets in the fourth period, fully depreciating the rest by the end of 1992. The assets include analog computer facilities such as phone switches, and cable and related equipment.    Since the Bell System breakup, ATandamp;T has taken a total of $13.4 billion in pretax charges to account for write-downs of obsolete long-distance facilities and telephone products and for factory consolidations, inventory adjustments, layoffs and accounting changes.    But executives said yesterday that the current contemplated write-off is fundamentally different because it is the result of ATandamp;T's three-year, $9 billion network-modernization program proceeding ahead of schedule, rather than a correction of past mistakes. ATandamp;T had said that the switched portion of its network wouldn't be 100% digital until the end of 1992. Switched facilities carry ordinary long-distance calls and aren't necessarily dedicated to a particular customer.    Analysts generally praised the move, saying they expected ATandamp;T would have to consider a write-down because it has been so aggressively modernizing its network. &quot;This is the first major action by the long-distance business that shows they are a competitive company and not a utility,&quot; said Jack Grubman of PaineWebber Inc. &quot;They are responding to competition and customer needs.&quot;    &quot;This signifies that ATandamp;T is determined to be a winner in the marketplace,&quot; said C. Perry Colwell, ATandamp;T's senior vice president for financial management.    ATandamp;T shares rose 62.5 cents yesterday, closing at $27.50, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Whether ATandamp;T will report net income for the year will depend on its level of earnings and how much of the assets it writes off, said Bernie Ragland, ATandamp;T's chief accountant. A write-off of $4 billion would result in a $2 billion after-tax charge to earnings, he said.    Last year, ATandamp;T earned $2.04 billion, or $1.88 a share, on revenue of $33.6 billion. When it took a $3.2 billion pretax charge in 1986, ATandamp;T eked out earnings of $139 million, or five cents a share, for the year.    But a complete write-off would strongly increase ATandamp;T earnings in future years, analysts said, because it would reduce depreciation expense. &quot;What would happen to our costs next year pleases us very much&quot; under that scenario, said Mr. Ragland. &quot;We don't make forecasts of earnings, but I am excited,&quot; Mr. Colwell said.    If ATandamp;T simply accelerates depreciation of the assets, depreciation expense would increase between $800 million and $1 billion annually through 1992, Mr. Ragland said.    Mr. Grubman predicted that ATandamp;T would choose to write off two-thirds of the assets, accelerating depreciation on the remaining third. Under that scenario, ATandamp;T would report net income this year of 30 cents a share, Mr. Grubman estimated. But he estimated that ATandamp;T's earnings next year would be 20 cents a share higher because of reduced depreciation expense.    Joseph Nacchio, vice president of business services, said ATandamp;T's network modernization is proceeding ahead of schedule for two reasons: Construction has simply occurred faster, and ATandamp;T has installed a new package of software in its phone switches that allows them to route calls more efficiently.    &quot;The phone network has become the inside of a large computer now. Basically, you have a bunch of big computers tied together by fiber,&quot; said Mr. Nacchio. &quot;And you get an exponential growth in capacity and a great kick in quality.&quot;    Mr. Ragland said ATandamp;T's regulatory reports to the Federal Communications Commission won't change significantly as a result of its decisions on the $4 billion to $5 billion in facilities, although it will ask the FCC to allow an increase in depreciation expense. ATandamp;T is required to keep long-distance profit to within 12.7% of its long-distance investment, but accounts showing regulated profits are separate and different from its financial books.    Analysts said ATandamp;T's third-quarter results were as expected, noting that product sales rose a buoyant 12.4% even with computer revenue remaining flat and selling, administrative and general expenses climbing 11%.    ATandamp;T reported third-quarter earnings of $587 million, or 55 cents a share, compared with $505 million, or 47 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 3.2% to $8.75 billion from $8.47 billion.    For the nine months, earnings rose 8.2% to $1.67 billion, or $1.56 a share, from $1.55 billion, or $1.42 a share. Revenue rose 3.4% to $25.85 billion from $25 billion.    Mr. Colwell said ATandamp;T is continuing to cut costs, paring 1989 headquarters budgets and discretionary expenses such as travel. His own group's costs are being cut 10%, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
