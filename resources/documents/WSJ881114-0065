Shafer (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pity Dan Quayle.    While President-elect George Bush may have only a short political honeymoon, the next vice president can't even get his foot in the bridal-suite door. The young Indiana senator already is known as Mr. Bush's &quot;veepette&quot; and appears on his way to becoming the most lampooned vice president in history.    &quot;What's the scariest sentence in the English language?&quot; queries one Capitol Hill jokester. Answer: &quot;Dan, I don't feel very well.&quot;    Despite the Bush camp's best efforts, Mr. Quayle has maintained a highly public profile, albeit in all the wrong ways. He was ridiculed mercilessly on Saturday Night Live over the weekend, has generated regular yucks on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show and even was the subject of a satirical underground newspaper with the banner headline: &quot;Quayle Becomes President. 'Uh-Oh' Says Worried Nation.&quot; Around Washington, Quayle jokes are popping up faster than job-seeking Republicans. And, across the nation, cartoonists and comedians are sharpening their pencils and gleefully writing him into their scripts.    Vice presidents, as Mr. Bush knows, are always red meat for political roasting. But even hardened humorists like comedy writer Bob Orben are surprised by the early assault on the man who is about to be just a chip shot away from the presidency. &quot;Normally what happens is that when somebody gets elected, for better or worse -- and I won't say which this is -- they usually get a grace period,&quot; Mr. Orben says. But &quot;having Dan Quayle as vice president for the next four years is like the voters passing the Relief Act of 1988 for the comedy writers of America.&quot;    Bush staffers aren't laughing. The mocking of the vice president, they worry, could undercut the serious tone that a new Bush administration hopes to set. Last Friday, for example, the New York Times even ran a serious op-ed article with the headline, &quot;Dump Quayle? It Still Could Happen.&quot; The authors, a National Law Journal writer and a New York lawyer, suggested the Electoral College could reject Sen. Quayle when it meets. Of course, nobody seriously thinks that would happen.    There are also divisive debates within the Bush camp over what to do with Sen. Quayle, who was relegated to the backwaters during the campaign. &quot;In fact,&quot; says Jay Leno, the comedian, &quot;more people claim to have seen Elvis than Dan Quayle.&quot;    Some Bush aides want to keep it that way, and haven't minced words in off-the-record sessions with reporters. Cartoonist Tim Menees, in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, shows Sen. Quayle dressed in short pants in a tree house outside the White House. Golf clubs lean nearby and a basket is suspended from the tree house. Below, one of three men says: &quot;Lower the basket when you need food.&quot;    &quot;Quayle can look forward to four years of greeting Campfire Girls and Cub Scouts,&quot; predicts comedian Mark Russell. &quot;When he gets under foot, Bush will say to him, 'Why don't you run up on Capitol Hill and break a tie?'&quot;    President-elect Bush has blasted the criticism of his running mate and has said Mr. Quayle will be a vital part of his administration, with access to intelligence data and oversight responsibilities for anti-drug and space efforts. But the new Rodney Dangerfield of American politics sometimes hasn't even gotten respect from Mr. Bush. Asked at a post-election press conference what Sen. Quayle's duties at the White House will be, Mr. Bush said he still hadn't &quot;formulated {them} in detail.&quot; But he did promise to have lunch regularly with his vice president.    Sen. Quayle's supporters say the comic ridicule -- which ranges from the merely needling to the vicious -- is unfair and that the vice president-elect will rise above it. Asked if the senator is taking the cracks personally, Jeff Nesbit, a spokesman for Sen. Quayle, said he is ignoring them, &quot;just as he did in the campaign.&quot; Mr. Nesbit adds: &quot;Over the next two months, he's just going to buckle down and do his homework. As for the way the media looks at his effort, that will just take its course.&quot;    All of the kidding could eventually produce a backlash of public sympathy for Sen. Quayle (a Save the Quayles movement, some wags call it). But for now, the nation's comics say a Quayle vice presidency is a license to skewer -- the best meal ticket since the Watergate days. In addition to Sen. Quayle's golfing and his National Guard Service during the Vietnam War, the comedic focus, says one humorist, will be &quot;his life of privilege, the C-student aspect and lightweight image.&quot; A sampling:   Commenting on the Israeli elections, Johnny Carson noted that Sen. Quayle needs to brush up on this part of the world. The senator thought &quot;Shamir was the killer whale at Sea World.&quot;    David Letterman lists the top 10 questions Vice President Quayle will ask at the White House: Among them, &quot;Can I have a Kermit {the frog} phone?&quot;; &quot;Which button am I supposed never to touch?&quot;; and, &quot;Mrs. Reagan, can I call you Mommy, too?&quot;    Declares Jay Leno: &quot;Bush boasted that the {Reagan} administration has created new jobs. Dukakis claimed these are just low-skill, do-nothing jobs. I say, leave Dan Quayle out of this.&quot;    Boston satirist Dick Flavin defends Sen. Quayle against complaints that he got into law school through a program for minorities and the disabled. It was all a misunderstanding, Mr. Flavin says. &quot;There was a question on the application, 'What is your handicap?' Quayle put down, 'Two strokes.'&quot;    In &quot;Doonesbury,&quot; Garry Trudeau depicts Sen. Quayle as invisible, except for a feather. Over the weekend, the satirical strip had the vice president-elect being sent on his first funeral trip -- to Alaska to deliver a eulogy for &quot;Bone,&quot; the whale.    The Washington Post, meanwhile, has begun a daily &quot;Quayle Watch&quot; with a short feature on the new vice president. One story described Sen. Quayle's first visit to his transition office, where it was reported that he said he had &quot;nothing specific to do.&quot;    The cover of the current New Republic magazine shows the world's countries with each nation color-coded to indicate what level of troubles the new president will face there. Countries colored in orange mean &quot;Deep doo-doo,&quot; drawing on a descriptor first voiced by Mr. Bush. Countries colored reddish orange are only &quot;Shallow doo-doo.&quot; But those colored blue, including Canada and Australia, mean: &quot;Quayle travel ok.&quot;    The Quayle humor phenomenon began last August at the Republican convention when his surprise selection as the GOP vice presidential candidate was immediately labeled &quot;Bush Lite.&quot; Then the flap over his Indiana National Guard service generated scores of jokes: &quot;They're making a movie about Quayle's Vietnam War experience. It's called, 'Full Dinner Jacket.'&quot; An alternative tag line: &quot;It's called '30 Seconds Over Muncie.'&quot; The joking continued over what was seen as the programming of Sen. Quayle by his campaign handlers.    The senator has often complicated matters for himself, particularly when he has spoken extemporaneously. In the final days of the campaign, while Mr. Bush was traveling to key areas to fight off a resurgence by Michael Dukakis, Sen. Quayle was scheduled to appear largely before groups of school children in politically safe places such as Charles City, Va. In Charles City, his speech, delivered from notes, was on the important aspects of Thanksgiving and, as reported in the Los Angeles Times, included such insights as: &quot;The first would be our family. Your family, my family -- which is composed of an immediate family of a wife and three children, a larger family with grandparents and aunts and uncles. We all have our family, whichever that may be.&quot;    At public events with the Bushes and the Reagans, the fresh-faced, 41-year-old senator sometimes seems to resemble an embarrassed teen-ager who crashed the grown-ups' party. &quot;Dan Quayle beside George Bush always looks like it's Saturday night and he wants to borrow the keys to the ship of state,&quot; says Mr. Orben, who was a speechwriter for President Ford.    Now comics say nothing is out of bounds, even the unthinkable. As Mark Russell puts it: &quot;Quayle said if he were suddenly thrust into the office of the presidency, he would say a prayer. Oh, wouldn't we all? We would become the most religious nation the world has ever seen -- with a sudden epidemic of knee callus.&quot;    Sen. Qualye's defenders, on the other hand, say he may surprise his critics yet. And, notes Sheila Tate, Mr. Bush's press secretary, &quot;He who laughs last, laughs best.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
