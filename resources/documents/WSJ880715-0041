As previously reported, one person familiar with the government's investigation of possible overcharges said the government contends that it may have been overcharged by as much as $10 million. The company confirmed that it is cooperating with the government's investigation.    It said the investigation involves a five-year pact that ended in 1987 and had a total value of about $8 million. Persons familiar with the investigation said prosecutors have told lawyers for the company that they intend to seek criminal charges against a Unisys unit and two of its officials. </TEXT></DOC>
