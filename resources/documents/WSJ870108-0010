BlamesMarket DisruptionFor Loss at a Unit</HL><DD> 01/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CDO </IN><DATELINE> ROSEMONT, Ill.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Comdisco Inc. blamed market disruption from the Securities and Exchange Commission's insider-trading investigation for its arbitrage unit's loss of $22 million, or 14% of its invested equity, for its fiscal first quarter.    The computer-leasing concern said that for the quarter, which ended Dec. 31, it expects to report operating profit of about $16 million, or between 15 and 20 cents a share. In the year-ago first quarter, Comdisco had net income of $23.5 million, or 57 cents a share.    Kenneth N. Pontikes, Comdisco's chairman and president, said the arbitrage unit's loss &quot;was primarily incurred as a result of the extensive market disruption that occurred after the Securities and Exchange Commission announced investigations into the illegal use of insider information.&quot;    Arbitragers estimate that industry losses reached $2 billion after investor Ivan F. Boesky settled insider-trading charges for $100 million in fines and other payments in November. The SEC's investigation is continuing, but Comdisco said its arbitrage unit, Comdisco Equities Inc., isn't involved in the investigation.    Comdisco said less than 10% of the company's assets were invested by the arbitrage unit. As of Sept. 30, about $100 million of Comdisco's total assets of $1.7 billion were invested by the unit, a company spokesman said.    &quot;Once the market stabilizes,&quot; said Mr. Pontikes, &quot;Comdisco Equities will resume a strong earnings trend, which has historically exceeded 30% annually.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
