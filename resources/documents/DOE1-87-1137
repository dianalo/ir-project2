The impacts considered are employment, gross domestic product,gross production and federal tax revenues. For purposes of comparison,the impacts of expenditures on electric power generated at existing facilities,and the construction of new nuclear and coal-fired generating stationsare also estimated. Representative designs of a new and retrofitted passivesolar house, and a typical solar water heating system, were developedand costs were estimated and incorporated into an interprovincial input-outputmodel from Statistics Canada. The model provides estimates, at provinciallevel, of economic impacts associated with any specified set of expenditures.One of the two sets of estimates made for employment and gross domesticproduct takes into account the impacts from consumer purchases out ofhousehold incomes earned from solar heating or alternate expenditures.Variations among the provinces are considerable, but the overall patternthat emerges from the results is as follows. Expenditures on solar heatinggenerate more employment, gross domestic product and federal revenuesthan equal expenditures on electric power and additional generating capacity.The province in which the expenditures are made and the systems are installedreceives most of the immediate impacts. Subsequent impacts are generallychanneled to Ontario and Quebec. Impacts from expenditures on electricpower are more localized than for any other option. 8 refs., 2 figs.,33 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
