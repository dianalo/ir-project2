Usry to end a legacy of corruption has seen himand 13 others charged in conspiracies that include bribes, illegalgifts and extortion.   The City Council president and zoning board chairman also wereamong those arrested on corruption charges Thursday after aneight-month state investigation. A 14th person has not yet beenarrested.   ``We've been the laughingstock of the country for a long time,''said Republican Assemblywoman Dolores Cooper, who lost the lastnon-partisan mayoral election to Usry. ``This sets us back anotherdecade.''   Usry, president of the National Conference of Black Mayors, waselected Atlantic City mayor five years ago as a reformist candidateafter his predecessor was implicated in an influence-peddlingscandal and lost a recall election.   The 67-year-old Republican mayor is charged with bribery,conspiracy, official misconduct and accepting unlawful gifts.   A criminal complaint against the 14 people alleged fiveoverlapping conspiracies, including an attempt to gain control of alucrative Boardwalk electric cart business and a gift shopfranchise at the Atlantic City International Airport. The carts areused by tourists to travel the Boardwalk.   State police Superintendent Col. Clinton L. Pagano said thecomplaints ``charge that the regulation of economic activity inAtlantic City, as administered by those arrested, has been up forsale.''   State Attorney General Peter Perretti Jr. said none of theinvestigations involved the casino industry.   The mayor said nothing in court during a bail hearing. Usry andthe other city officials were released on their own recognizance.   Attorneys from the state Division of Criminal Justice areexpected to present a case to a state grand jury within severalweeks. Usry and the others do not have to forfeit their publicoffices on the basis of a criminal complaint, Perretti said.   In a search of Usry's home on Thursday, police confiscated$6,000 in cash, alleged to be conspiracy money, Pagano said.   Usry is in his second term as mayor. He won his first term onMay 13, 1984. His predecessor, Michael Matthews, was ousted in arecall election. Matthews was found guilty in an influence-peddlingscheme involving casino-zoned land, and and was sentenced to a15-year prison term for extortion.   Usry was swept into office with help from disgruntled whitevoters and the city's large black population. He was considered anally of Gov. Thomas H. Kean.   According to the attorney general, the arrests resulted from aninvestigation that began in November, prompted by a complaint byAtlantic City businessman Albert Black. Black said some cityofficials had demanded a bribe from him to get a business proposalapproved by the zoning board.   The initial investigation involved bribery and influencepeddling by some members of the City Council and zoning board,officials said. That probe led to investigations against the mayorand others on similar charges.   The others arrested Thursday included Walter Collette, 61, CityCouncil president; Kaleem Shabazz, 52, chairman of the AtlanticCity zoning board; Lillian Bryant, 45, an Atlantic Countyfreeholder; Gene Dorn, 47, councilman; Arnold Orsatti Jr., 46,chairman of the Atlantic City council's transportation committee;and Sylvetta Pilgrim, 44, an administrative assistant with the citylandlord-tenant affairs board.   Also charged were: W. Oscar Harris Jr., 46, former director ofthe Atlantic City Housing Authority; Harold Mosee, 47, formercouncilman and an aide to Collette; Robert McCurdy, 46, a formerbusiness partner of Harris; Jack Wolf, 57, a business consultant;Ernest English, 32, a local businessman; and Clarence Gillard, noage or occupation available.   The 14th person, Barbara Woodall, was out of the state Thursday.The 49-year-old candidate for Atlantic County freeholder facescharges of campaign contribution violations and conspiracy.   Black, a lifetime resident of the Atlantic City area and themanager of a local Wells Fargo security agency, said he filed thecomplaint that started the probe because he wanted to give thecasinos a chance to restore the city of his youth to something morethan glitzy gaming halls ringed by poverty.   ``I would like Atlantic City to be a respected town _ not forpeople to say there's a bunch of scumbums here,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
