Democrat Gary Hart was ready to drop outa second time as the shrinking field converged on Illinois for thenext big campaign test.   Kemp was crushed in the Super Tuesday landslide of VicePresident George Bush, who rejoined the campaign trail today aftertaking a day off to rest and celebrate.   The New York congressman congratulated Bush and said he would``be proud to campaign'' for whoever wins the nomination, but heendorsed none of the three remaining GOP contenders.   ``I am folding up my tent, but I plan to continue to carry theflag high,'' said Kemp, the former pro football quarterback whoportrayed himself as the natural conservative heir to PresidentReagan, whose economic programs have included many of Kemp's ideas.   He said both Bush and Sen. Bob Dole have embraced conservativepositions, partly because of his presence in the presidentialcampaign.   Kemp said he would not seek a new term in Congress and was ``notmaking any plans'' to run for the Senate or to pursue the vicepresidency. However, he called the idea of the vice presidentialnomination ``a very flattering and awesome thought. ... Would Ithink about it, the answer is yes.''   Dole, who also was all but buried in the Bush victories onTuesday, campaigned in Chicago today, trying to sow seeds of doubtabout Bush's chances in November if he should win the GOPnomination.   ``I would be a much stronger candidate,'' Dole said.   Democratic Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee was also inChicago, and was making similar comments about his chief rival.``For those who want another election blowout and see theDemocratic Party losing 49 of 50 states, vote for Mike Dukakis,''he said.   On Wednesday, Bush suggested to Dole, his closest competitor,that the race for the GOP nomination was becoming just a bit besidethe point. It might be time, he said, to turn the attention towardthe general election in November.   ``I believe it is now time to look ahead to the issues whichdistinguish us from the Democrats,'' the vice president told Dolein a telegram in which he rebuffed the Kansas senator's request fora series of one-on-one debates.   ``Good luck,'' Bush added.   Dole was having none of that, as he searched for a share ofIllinois' 82 GOP delegates at stake in Tuesday's primary.   ``I've got to win in Illinois,'' he said. Later, he told lawstudents: ``I feel like I've just taken the finals, and I didn'tflunk but I didn't do too well either.''   And he taunted Bush for refusing to agree to the no-moderatordebates, saying: ``Here's a chance, George, to finish me off righthere in Illinois.''   Dole said Wednesday that Kemp telephoned him to tell him hewould drop out on Thursday and to say he would endorse none of hisrivals.   It looked like the end of the line for Hart as well. TheColorado senator refused to talk to reporters about the SuperTuesday results. But he scheduled a Denver news conference Fridaymorning, and sources said he was abandoning his bid.   The Super Tuesday races left Hart disqualified for furtherfederal matching funds. He technically lost his eligibility lastmonth, but could have restored it with a 10-percent draw in any ofthe day's primaries.   Hart had already dropped out of the Democratic race once. InMay, he quit amid reports of his relationship with a Miami model,and he amazed political observers by declaring in December that hewas back.   ``Let the people decide,'' he said. But the people accorded himfew votes in any of the early contests.   The rest of the Democrats were gathering for a forum tonightsponsored by Illinois Democrats.   Two of the Democrats _ Sen. Paul Simon and Jesse Jackson _ werecampaigning on home turf in Illinois, with its prize of 173Democratic delegates. Simon, who bypassed Tuesday's contests andsaid he must do well in Illinois to continue, wasn't planning tospend any money on television advertising.   ``I offer Illinois 30 years of service rather than a 30-secondcommercial,'' he said.   Jackson, for his part, made a triumphant homecoming to Chicagoon Wednesday, still thrilled by his showing the day before. Heplaced first in the popular vote, splitting a big delegate haulwith Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis and Gore.   ``We get stronger every day,'' Jackson told plant workers insuburban Chicago.   At a rally later, he promised to eschew attacks on the otherDemocrats. ``I'm moving ahead,'' he said. ``I'm going to fightGeorge Bush. That's my opposition.''   Gore, however, pronounced himself the Democrat most likely tosucceed in November.   ``I'm not going to say that any of our candidates areunelectable,'' he said in an interview on Cable News Network. ``ButI have the best chance.''   The theme of electability was also sounded by Dukakis. ``I hopewhen the people of Illinois cast their votes they'll do so forsomeone who can clearly win the presidency,'' he said.   Rep. Richard Gephardt, who carried only his home state ofMissouri in Tuesday's contests, said he was still in the running.   Pat Robertson, his GOP campaign flagging, said Wednesday hewould take a day off before heading for Illinois. ``It isn't overyet,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
