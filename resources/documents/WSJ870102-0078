The bureau said the estimate represents an increase of less than 1% from the 239.9 million residents as of Jan. 1, 1986. By contrast, the nation's population grew between 1.6% and 1.9% a year during 1947 to 1961 -- the postwar baby boom period. The record one-year net gain was 3.1 million in 1956.    The Census Bureau forecast that the U.S. population will grow by 2.2 million during 1987. Births should reach their highest level this year since the mid-1960s, it said.    The population estimate doesn't include federal employees stationed abroad. </TEXT></DOC>
