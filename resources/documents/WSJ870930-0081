The apparent loss of ground during 12 days of hearings prompted Judge Bork to express concern to the White House. White House officials say the nominee met with top Reagan aides Saturday and questioned the effectiveness of the administration's campaign to secure his confirmation.    Separately, Sen. Alan Cranston of California, the assistant Democratic leader, said yesterday, &quot;I think he's licked.&quot; He said his private survey of senators shows 49 against Judge Bork, 40 in favor and 11 undecided. Other senators, however, believe Sen. Cranston is exaggerating the numbers, and that the nomination is still a tossup.    The concern expressed by the 60-year-old Judge Bork at the White House wasn't focused on a specific head count. But the hearings have created an atmosphere in which it would be respectable to vote against Judge Bork. This is especially important for southern Democrats and moderate Republicans, whose votes will likely decide the fight. A number of southern Democrats have begun to express doubts about Judge Bork's views on civil rights and other issues.    White House aides insist they reassured Judge Bork at the meeting Saturday that he has the president's full support and that the campaign is on track. &quot;When he left,&quot; says a senior aide, &quot;he had a better feeling that things were being handled, probably better than he thought.&quot;    Nevertheless, White House officials plan to launch a tough, new drive to improve the chances of confirmation, and they say President Reagan himself will make more direct attacks on the foes of the appointment. The new drive will focus on Judge Bork as a champion of &quot;law and order,&quot; an issue aides think has been lost in the Senate hearings. The White House also will portray opposition to Judge Bork as an effort by narrowly focused &quot;special interest groups&quot; to undermine a Supreme Court candidate who isn't favorable to their causes.    A meeting has been scheduled today in the White House with Bork supporters, at which Mr. Reagan will make public remarks. And White House aides are scheduling a speech later in the week to address the Bork nomination again. Moreover, White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker has begun calling senators and yesterday was working Senate back rooms. Judge Bork has also been meeting with senators in recent days. And White House aides say President Reagan will shortly begin calling senators.    The White House offensive is aimed at trying to counter an atmosphere that has turned decidedly against Judge Bork. Some 70 witnesses at the Senate hearings, most of them lawyers or law professors, have testified for or against Judge Bork. The numbers were about evenly divided and included a few forceful witnesses debating Judge Bork's constitutional views on both sides. But the witnesses apparently failed to alleviate concerns that remained about Judge Bork's views after he testified for five days at the start of the hearings.    Among questions left unresolved by the hearings are whether Judge Bork would uphold a constitutional right to privacy, whether he would respect Supreme Court precedents with which he disagrees and how vigorously he would apply the 14th Amendment guarantee of &quot;equal protection of the laws.&quot;    The hearings &quot;raised some concerns,&quot; said Sen. Richard Shelby (D., Ala.), who added that he hasn't decided how to vote. &quot;There's trouble&quot; for Judge Bork among southern Democrats, Sen. Shelby said. &quot;There's a perception that Bork could possibly have an unsettling effect,&quot; he added, citing civil rights progress in the South, among other issues. &quot;We don't want to revisit a lot of issues.&quot;    Another southerner, Sen. David Pryor (D., Ark.), who also hasn't declared how he will vote, said, &quot;I don't feel the strength in the Senate that I felt for him 30 days ago.&quot;    Before the fight in the full Senate, however, the 14-member Judiciary Committee must vote, probably next week, and procedural maneuvering has begun. Committee Democrats have said they will let the nomination go to the full Senate even if the committee votes to reject Judge Bork. But Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the majority leader and a committee member, said he would prefer to vote only on sending the nomination to the Senate without a recommendation, an approach proposed more than a week ago by White House lobbyists. Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), committee chairman, said he is &quot;undecided&quot; about how to conduct the voting.    Sen. Cranston said yesterday that his count includes at least one or two Democrats who will vote for Judge Bork. He said it includes some Republicans and some southern Democrats who have told him they are likely to vote against. White House aides dispute the survey and say there are at least 20 undecided senators.    ---   Jeffrey H. Birmbaum contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
