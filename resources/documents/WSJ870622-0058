PerryStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Let's see now. Babbitt already has debated DuPont. Kemp is getting ready to debate Gephardt. All the Democrats are meeting for a debate in Houston July 1. Most of the Republicans will be debating at the Iowa State Fair in August.    &quot;It is like a deluge of debates,&quot; says John Buckley, Republican Rep. Jack Kemp's press secretary. And it's happening months before the first caucuses and primaries in 1988.    Just consider the possibilities and permutations.    There are seven Democrats and six Republicans officially (or semiofficially) running for president, with more to come.    So if everybody had a one-on-one debate with everybody else -- and these minidebates are the rage this year -- the nation could look forward to 78 separate encounters. (For the cognoscenti, the one that would fill Yankee Stadium pits the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the left-wing Democrat, against the Rev. Pat Robertson, right-wing Republican. Unfortunately, it hasn't been arranged, yet.)    Then there could be two-on-two debates, or four Republicans against three Democrats. Or all seven Democrats against all six Republicans.    &quot;It was meaningless straw polls four years ago,&quot; says Richard Moe, a senior adviser to Democratic Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri. &quot;This time, debates are going to be the new dynamic factor in American politics. And that's a big improvement.&quot;    These presidential contenders are threatening to do something startling: They want to talk about the issues -- and talk and talk.    The heavy maxi-debate business gets under way at the Wortham Theater in Houston July 1, when William F. Buckley's TV show, &quot;Firing Line,&quot; goes live for two hours on most of the Public Broadcasting System's 305 stations. All seven Democrats say they will be there, desperate to make their mark. Besides Mr. Jackson and Rep. Gephardt, they are: Bruce Babbitt, former governor of Arizona, Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, and Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois.    &quot;It won't really be like a debate,&quot; promises Sue Davis, who is helping with the arrangements. &quot;It will be more like a free-for-all.&quot;    On the firing line with the veteran conservative, Mr. Buckley, will be the veteran wheeler-dealer, Robert Strauss, former Democratic national chairman.    &quot;Buckley drives you crazy,&quot; says Mr. Strauss, &quot;but he's awfully good. He'll ask some questions, and I'll ask some questions. And if it gets dull, maybe Buckley and I will have a little conversation between us.&quot;    Candidates clamoring for attention in this free-for-all environment will have to shout to be heard.    Affluent corporations and foundations are being asked to contribute about $10,000 apiece to foot &quot;Firing Line's&quot; bill. For their trouble, fat-cat contributors get tickets to the show. &quot;We don't have in mind,&quot; Miss Davis says, &quot;handing out two tickets for a $100 contribution.&quot;    The debating situation with the Republicans is a little dodgier, thanks largely to Vice President George Bush's reluctance to come out and play. Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, the Republican Senate leader and the man generally thought to be Mr. Bush's leading challenger for the nomination, says he won't play if Mr. Bush won't play. That leaves the GOP field to Pierre S. DuPont, the former governor of Delaware, former Secretary of State Alexander Haig, Rep. Kemp, and Mr. Robertson.    &quot;The vice president is a big believer in debates and plans to participate in some,&quot; says Lee Atwater, Vice President Bush's campaign manager. &quot;But he's not officially a candidate, and we haven't sat down to sort out what we want to do. We have 68 invitations for debates, and there is no way to accept them all.&quot;    &quot;We are looking for opportunities when all the Republicans are gathered together for a debate,&quot; says William Lacy, Sen. Dole's campaign director. &quot;But without the vice president, we think it will be a long time before we accept anything.&quot;    Vice President Bush and Sen. Dole, of course, both have a background in debates. Sen. Dole's reputation was marred for years following his ferocious performance in a vice presidential debate against Walter Mondale in 1976. Vice President Bush's presidential campaign in 1980 collapsed in New Hampshire when Ronald Reagan grabbed the microphone, noting that, after all, he had paid for it.    The other Republicans think it's a mistake for Vice President Bush and Sen. Dole to play a waiting game. &quot;We may have a first here,&quot; says John Buckley, Mr. Kemp's press secretary, &quot;a situation in which we have debates with two empty chairs on the stage.&quot;    Eventually, of course, there will be debates between the presidential and vice presidential nominees. That's already a problem. Since 1976, these debates have been sponsored by the League of Women Voters. This year, in an effort to institutionalize the debates, the two major parties intend to be the sponsors.    But the league isn't giving in easily. &quot;We are organizing three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate,&quot; says Nancy Neuman, the league's president. &quot;And the candidates can decide which series of debates they want to participate in. We think they will choose our debates. We have a track record, and we are nonpartisan.&quot;    As all these debates unfold in what is sure to be the greatest debating campaign in history, there will be memorable moments.    Perhaps they will even match the 1972 Democratic debate in New Hampshire between Sens. Edmund Muskie, George McGovern and Vance Hartke; Mayor Sam Yorty of Los Angeles; and 32-year-old Edward T. Coll, a social worker from Connecticut who managed, somehow, to get on the ballot. Mr. Coll pulled a rubber rat out of his pocket and waved it at the cameras. &quot;This is the problem,&quot; he said, without further elucidation.    Or the 1976 presidential debate between Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, when the power blinked off for 27 minutes and the two candidates just stood there on the stage, looking, in the words of the late Marshall McLuhan, &quot;like two guys at the dry cleaner's waiting for their pants to be pressed.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
