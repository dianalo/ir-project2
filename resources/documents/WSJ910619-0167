An attorney for Mr. Bush said he will withdraw an appealof the decision by an Office of Thrift Supervisionadministrative law judge over Mr. Bush's conduct as adirector of the failed Silverado Banking, Savings andamp; LoanAssociation from August 1985 to August 1988. The Denverthrift collapsed in late 1988, and government estimates putits bailout costs at about $1 billion.</LP><TEXT>   The OTS ruling found that Mr. Bush improperly approved aloan to a business partner while Mr. Bush was an outsidedirector of Silverado. The administrative law judge alsodetermined that Mr. Bush didn't disclose a businessrelationship with another large borrower.   &quot;At some point in time you have to just put this behindyou,&quot; said Mr. Bush's attorney, James Nesland. &quot;The agencieshave enormous staying power compared with a private person.You can't spend the better part of your time jousting withthe government over a matter of principle.&quot;   Mr. Bush's decision means he will accept light sanctionsfrom the thrift agency. Under the terms of the ruling, whichwas upheld by OTS Director Timothy Ryan in April, Mr. Bushmust &quot;cease and desist from any acts, omissions or practicesinvolving any conflicts of interest, unsafe or unsoundpractices or breaches of fiduciary duties&quot; as a director of afinancial institution.   Simply put, that means that if Mr. Bush becomes a directorof a bank or thrift, he would be required to provide theinstitution with a list of his legal business relationshipsand then consult with a lawyer about those relationships ifany is found to be in conflict, Mr. Nesland said.   Mr. Bush's decision comes just two weeks after he and 12others agreed to pay $49.5 million to settle a FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. civil suit alleging negligence andinsider dealings in the Silverado matter.   The OTS's Mr. Ryan couldn't be reached for comment. In hisApril decision, he argued that directors of depositoryinstitutions should be held to &quot;an even higher fiduciaryduty&quot; than directors of other companies.   Mr. Nesland said Mr. Bush &quot;didn't do anything wrong.&quot;Moreover, &quot;I still believe -- and he believes -- it was donefor political purposes.&quot;   For his part, President Bush has been careful not to offeran opinion on the case, but he has said that the legalprocess should be allowed to work. Barbara Bush, however, hasproclaimed her son's innocence of any wrongdoing. A WhiteHouse spokesman declined to comment on the matter last night.   Mr. Nesland said Mr. Bush, 36 years old, is evaluating anumber of job offers. Mr. Bush, whose house is for sale inDenver, recently left his post at Apex Energy.   Mr. Bush's decision not to appeal the ruling came on thesame day that the OTS announced its first disciplinarysettlements with law firms associated with failed thrifts,including Silverado. The Denver law firm of Sherman andamp; Howard,and partner Ronald H. Jacobs, agreed to a number of OTSrestrictions on future activities that will stay in force forthree to five years.   Mr. Jacobs, once a director of Silverado's holdingcompany, agreed not to serve as a director or officer of afederally insured depository institution. The firm agreed tobar its lawyers from serving on thrift boards. In astatement, the firm said the settlement &quot;contains noadmission of liability or fault of any kind.&quot;   In the second settlement, Ingram, Matthews andamp; Stroud ofHattiesburg, Miss., agreed to reimburse $47,720 in fees itreceived for representing failed First Guaranty Bank forSavings, also of Hattiesburg. The firm's three partners arebarred from future participation in the affairs of anyfederally insured depository institution without the writtenconsent of the appropriate federal regulatory agency. Thepartners couldn't be reached for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
