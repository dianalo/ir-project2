His waking hours were spent in a frenetic race from televisionstudios to the halls of Congress, from radio booths to White Houseoffices. Such was Arad's visibility that one senior White Houseofficial suggested he switch jobs and become a media star.   ``We mounted a paramount information campaign,'' said thesoft-spoken envoy who has represented his country in Washington forthe past two years, which have been some of the most turbulent inthe 40-year-old relationship between the two allies.   By satellite from Jerusalem, telefax machines in Washington andairwaves around the United States, Israeli officials sought todeflect accusations _ made privately by some administrationofficials and publicly by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole _ thatIsrael's kidnapping of a Lebanese cleric was a cavalier act thatendangered American hostages in Lebanon.   ``We acted in a coordinated fashion, in a widesweeping andintensive way. We were all mobilized in this campaign,'' Arad said.   The Israelis swung into action on Monday, hours after a groupcalling itself The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth releaseda videotape purporting to show the hanged body of kidnapped Marine,Lt. Col. William Higgins. The Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem groupsaid Higgins was killed in retaliation for Israel's July 28kidnapping of Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid.   Arad appeared on two prime-time television news shows thatevening, followed by Israeli Arab Affairs Minister Ehud Olmert fromJerusalem on ABC TV's ``Nightline'' program. Arad was up earlyTuesday for a 7 a.m. National Public Radio program. ForeignMinister Moshe Arens followed minutes later from Jerusalem,appearing on ABC's ``Good Morning America.``   At the embassy, meanwhile, secretaries were faxing to members ofCongress and the media a list of terrorist acts, including carbombings and infiltration attempts into Israel, allegedly plannedby Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid in his capacity as a leader of theIranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.   Arens said Obeid was directly responsible for the Higgins'kidnapping in Lebanon 17 months ago, and may also have beenresponsible for his death. ``I think in retrospect we will see thatwe struck a very effective blow against terrorism,'' he said.   On Tuesday, reactions started coming in. The embassy said itreceived 135 calls, of which 124 praised Israel for its toughstance against terrorism. A handful were hate calls, said onestaffer.   Arad worked the phones, too, calling dozens of lawmakers toexplain Israel's position and elicit their views. Dole and severalHouse members publicly criticized Israel for reckless behavior andfor failing to consult the United States. Arad conceded that otherlawmakers and officials held similar views.   ``It was important to nip that in the bud,'' he said. ``Theadministration initially appeared undecided'' about whether Israelshould or shouldn't be blamed, he said.   Indeed, while White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was carefulon Monday not to criticize Israel's actions, he also told reportersthat, ``It is fair to say that many people do share the senator's(Dole's) concern.''   By Wednesday, ``people were talking about what the United Statesshould do to save the hostages, not who it should blame,'' Aradsaid.   Israel, a nation of 4.3 million isolated among hostile Arabnations, is highly sensitive to its image abroad. It long enjoyedvirtual blanket approval from the U.S. government and the Americanpublic, but both have adopted a more questioning attitude in recentyears.   Crises in relations with its main financial backer anddiplomatic ally highlight Israelis' feelings that the world ignoresthe Arab threat to their security and treats them according to adouble standard.   ``Israel is in a war, fighting against an enemy that doesn'tplay by the norms and rules that the West shares. Put otherwise,you can't wear kid gloves in a brass knuckle neighborhood,'' saidHarry Wall, director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rithin Israel.   By Thursday, Israel had placed a whole new construction on itskidnapping of Obeid.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the issue of the 16 Americanand European hostages held in Lebanon by shadowy Shiite Moslemgroups had been ``swept under the rug'' for a long time, untilIsrael revived it with the Obeid abduction.   Rabin said he hoped Israel's action would not only ``capture theheadlines,'' but also bring about the captives' freedom.</TEXT></DOC>
