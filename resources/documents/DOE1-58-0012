The natural gasindustry has identified the cogeneration market as a key to long-term,sustained growth in an era when conservation and competitive fuels haveeroded traditional markets. This attention is justified when one realizesthat almost two-thirds of the Qualifying Facilities fuel their cogenerationplant with natural gas. In the past, the larger industrial energy usershave accounted for most of the cogeneration power produced, by utilizingcombustion turbine or steam turbine technology. As the cogeneration industrymatures and becomes more understood and accepted by the light industrialand commercial markets, the trend will be towards a proliferation ofsmaller, packaged cogeneration systems based on reciprocating enginetechnology. Along with the introduction of reliable and inexpensive controlsand logic systems, engine manufacturers are focusing more attention ondeveloping internal combustion engines for prime duty service for theproduction of electricity. Reciprocating engines clearly dominate thecogeneration market for installations under 3000 kw. At this level andunder there are a number of engine models and manufacturers available,offering both diesel and gas-fired systems. Primarily because of fuelcosts, natural gas-fired systems. Primarily because of fuel costs, naturalgas-fired systems. Primarily because of fuel costs, natural gas-firedengines are used in the vast majority of engine-based cogeneration installations.</TEXT></DOC>
