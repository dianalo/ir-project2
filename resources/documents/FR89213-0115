The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application foramendment dated November 9, 1988. The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed change to the license is required in order to delete the currentrequirement to install an additional brace on the HCUs. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed deletion ofthe license condition. The proposed deletion of the license condition wouldremove the requirement to install an additional brace on each of the HCUs.The staff's reviewed the seismic and dynamic qualification of the HCUs.Based on the staff's evaluation, it is concluded that the unmodified testHCU was subject to vibration fatigue far in excess of the seismic/dynamicenvironment postulated to occur at River Bend Station over the 40 yearlife. The staff concludes that the additional brace is not required andthe license condition can be deleted. Therefore, the proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequencesof any accident, no changes are being made in the types of any effluentsthat may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in theallowable individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly,the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significantradiological environmental impact. With regard to potential nonradological impacts, the proposed change tothe license condition involves systems located within the restricted areasas defined in 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological planteffluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commissionconcludes that there are no significant nonradological environmental impactsassociated with the proposed amendment. The Notice of Consideration ofIssuance of Amendments and Opportunity for Hearing in connection with thisaction was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 2, 1988 (53 FR 48743). No requestfor hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following thisnotice. Alternative to the Proposed Action Since the Commission concluded that there is no signficant adverse environmentaleffect that would result from the proposed action, alternatives with equalor greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce the impact of plant operations on the environment andwould result in implementing modifications to the facility. Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statement for the River Bend Station, Unit 1,dated January 1985. Agencies and Persons Consulted The NRC has reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult other agenciesor persons. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact </ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment. Based upon this environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposedaction will not have a significant adverse effect on the quality of thehuman environment.
