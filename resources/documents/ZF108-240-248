 Months of tedious coding and debuggingmay build character, but it doesn't always build a quality application.andP;  Thefourth-generation languages--&quot;4GLs&quot;, for short--purport to rescue developersfrom this drudgery, reducing the development process from months to days, andrendering the time actually invested more productive.andM;The two 4GLs on the block here are typical of their breed, and have in commonthose key elements that have come to define the term 4GL.andP;  (For previousassessments of 4GL products appearing in UNIX REVIEW, see &quot;Off the Shelf&quot;,Vol.andP;  6 No.andP;  9, pp.andP;  83-89, and Vol.andP;  7 No.andP;  10, pp.andP;  109-118.)andP;  Accell, fromUnify Corp., and Informix's Rapid Development System are both more than meredatabase managers.andP;  In fact, judging from the weight of their documentation,and the space it devotes to database management, one quickly gets theimpression that the DBMS plays only a bit-part--these packages were built tocreate and maintain complete applications, not just shuffle records around.andM;DocumentationandM;Since database managers have been around for so long, most vendors know howto write documentation for them: create a separate reference manual, and addlots of tutorials.andP;  Neither Unify's nor Informix's manual set is arrangedlike standard UNIX documentation, but that doesn't make them any harder toread.andP;  Demonstration databases are provided, and the demos cover the mostcrucial aspects of developing and using the programs produced by these 4GLs.andM;Accell is primarily a layer above Unify's basic RDBMS, and the documentationreflects this.andP;  The Unify RDBMS is included in Accell, and most of whatAccell does can be done in Unify's RDBMS, although not as quickly or asattractively.andP;  Informix's Rapid Development System (RDS) doesn't add nearlyas much to its base product, which is also included.andP;  However, what RDS doesadd is worth having, and the documentation is quite good.andM;In addtion to being tools for producing applications more quickly, thesepackages and their accompanying documentation constitute the best means ofintroducing newcomers to database management.andP;  The tutorials assume noknowledge of database-management techniques, and the forms layout anddatabase-building tools provided make it possible for beginners to get up tospeed much more quickly.andP;  Part of trimming down the time needed to produce anapplication is simplifying the environment.andP;  In so doing, both Unify andInformix have built the perfect educational system for their databasemanagers--the documentation is careful to describe what's going on behind thescenes of each automated activity.andP;  Getting through either package's tutorialwould earn the reader a DBMS merit badge.andM;Making It WorkandM;The software was tested on a network of three Siva PCs from NVS America, two20 MHz 80386 systems running Interactive's 386/ix version 2.0.1, and one 20MHz 80286 system running MS-DOS.andP;  They were interconnected with Ethernet,TCP/IP, and NFS.andP;  Tests were conducted across network connections, and withdatabases resident on NFS-mounted filesystems.andM;Unify's Accell development system is typical of the latest crop of 4GLs.andP;  Itsintegrated development environment, text-based windowed user interface,forms-layout tools, and on-line help are foremost among the elements thatallow the developer to progress rapidly from a design to a finished product.andM;Accell's appearance is tuned for intelligent terminals--the more featuresyour terminal has, the better Accell will look.andP;  It is visually attractive,making use of line-drawing characters and color.andM;The product sent by Unify for review was reportedly built for InteractiveSystems' 386/ix operating system.andP;  The installation (from tape--floppies areavailable, too, but tape is such a relief!) went very smoothly.andP;  It was onlywhen I attempted to start the program that I began to run into trouble.andM;Administrators who have built custom entries into their terminfo databases(the System V terminal-capability database) will be dismayed to learn thatAccell uses a blend of termcap (the capability-database format used in BSDUNIX and Zenix) and a proprietary definition file called unicap to defineterminal characteristics.andP;  Further, Accell does not support the 386/ixconsole terminal type, the AT386 (an ANSI-compliant terminal emulator).andO;After some messing about, it was possible to get it to operate, but textwindows wouldn't display properly, leaving underlying regions of the screengarbled.andP;  Moving over to a DOS-based machine and using FTP Software'srloginvt program to invoke a vt 100 emulator across the network proved morefruitful, but more frustration lay in wait.andM;Running through Accell's full-screen interface, there are two ways to invokeoperations: function keys and mnemonic escape sequences.andP;  The unicap entryfor the vt 100 defines only four function keys--which is correct--but whenAccell displays its function-key mappings, it maps keys all the way up toF20.andP;  According to the manual, when a function key is not available, the usermust resort to hard-coded escape sequences.andP;  Doing an add/update of an entryto a database, for example, is andless;ESCandgt;au.andP;  That's sensible enough, but with thelong list of functions available in Accell's various modes, there are a lotof mnemonics to memorize if you haven't enough function keys.andM;Since the last line on the screen is always occupied by a function-key map, Iwould vote to replace it with a Lotus-style horizontal menu.andP;  Making adevice-independent application dependent on function keys and a proprietaryterminal database limits its usefulness in large shops that have a widevariety of equipment.andP;  The Accell development environment compensates forthese deficiencies somewhat by making it possible to build applications thatdon't require the use of function keys.andM;Function keys notwithstanding, building applications with Accell isreasonably straightforward.andP;  Database tables and layout of display forms aredefined using the interface provided.andP;  The forms design is flexible, allowingdesigners to build a hierarchy of forms through which they navigate withnext-and previous-form keys.andP;  Forms can contain information from any table inthe database, but every form is mapped to a primary table.andP;  Field names inthat table can be displayed in pop-up windows during form layout, makingshort work of simple forms.andP;  Fields in other tables can't be called up,however, and the option is missed.andP;  Two degrees of field-level help can bebuilt into a form: a single line of text that appears when the cursor movesinto a field, and an arbitrarily-sized pop-up window invoked by the &quot;fieldhelp&quot; function.andM;An interesting feature of Accell's interface in ZoomView.andP;  Forms can be tiedtogether so that when the cursor is positioned on a field, and more detailabout that field is available, the user can &quot;zoom&quot; in to extract or modifythe more detailed information.andP;  Such information can be as simple as a listof state abbreviations presented in an address field, or as complex as ascrollable list of line items brought up when the user &quot;zooms&quot; in on aninvoice-total field.andP;  ZoomView is intuitive to use, and Accell's windowedlook allows multiple views to exist simultaneously on screen.andM;There are some &quot;gotcha&quot;s in Accell's interface, however.andP;  The up and downarrow keys are defined ambiguously.andP;  In some places, they move the cursor(rightly, in my mind) across fields in a form.andP;  When adding a new recordthrough a form, however, these keys call up the previous and next existingrecords in the table.andP;  When the record is recalled, all edits to the form areobliterated.andM;The use of the next-and previous-form keys is similarly bewildering.andP;  In oneinstance, the next-form key brings up a window of optional information.andO;After filling in this pop-up form, pressing the previous-form key does makethe pop-up go away, but its data disappears, too.andP;  To file the changes, usersmust press the next-form key to go back to the previous form.andP;  These problemsmight have been avoided through proper coding, but Unify's own demo programsshow them clearly, and the manual speaks of these traits as though they makesense.andM;Informix: What Dry IsandM;By comparison, Informix is boring, but in a good way, Accell's glamour comesat a price, placing extreme demands on the terminal equipment and the peoplewho configure it.andP;  Informix seems to run on anything--and it gave me none ofthe hassles Accell did in setting up.andP;  Beyond that, Informix offers a moreSpartan environment.andP;  Much of the development has to be done by hand.andP;  Forexample, while Accell provides full-screen interfaces to assist in the layoutof database structures, Informix requires that this be handled through itsprocedural language.andP;  In many other ways, Informix lacks the panache ofAccell's development environment.andP;  For UNIX users, this dearth ofornamentation seems appropriate, but the less literate may find it ahindrance.andM;There's an appeal to Informix's approach: it works.andP;  In fact, it worked sowell during my evaluation that there isn't much to say about it.andP;  Itsshortcoming is its relative awkwardness in comparison to a truly integratedenvironment (like Accell).andP;  Informix's RDS is more of a compromise.andP;  To useInformix RDS, you must learn Informix.andP;  The procedural language, the formsdescriptions--every element of the development system--requires study beforeit can be used.andP;  It's as difficult as learning any new programming languagebut anyone armed with a basic understanding of procedural languages anddatabase structures should do fine.andM;In the specific area of a forms-design tool, Informix comes up woefully shyof the mark--there is no forms-design tool.andP;  Forms must be laid out by hand,using the UNIX editor of your choice (vi is the default, of course).andP;  Acomplex form could take some time to build, and would certainly requireprintouts of all the tables involved.andP;  Matters are somewhat simplified by arudimentary form generator, which draws up a simple vertical form (one fieldper line) containing all the fields in a given table.andP;  This would seem to bea logical starting place for any form layout, since rearranging thedisplayable portion of the form would be sufficient to render acceptableresults.andM;Informix's typical method of displaying data is much like that of the baseUnify product in that the entire screen is used.andP;  Informix's RDS, likeUnify's Accell, introduces windows, and while the documentation makes themappear to be an afterthought, they're really well integrated.andP;  Menus,displayed in a space-saving, intuitive horizontal style, are also aworthwhile extra in the RDS.andM;Since Informix is steeped in its procedural language, it's comforting to knowit is intended to be taken seriously: Informix offers an interactivedebugger.andP;  This is no toy, and it includes most features that people who maketheir livings writing code expect to find in a real debugger.andM;The debugger works with two windows on one screen and then a third &quot;window&quot;that is, in effect, a full screen.andP;  The two windows are for source code anddebugger commands, and their output.andP;  The full screen, containing output fromthe application, pops up whenever the application requires it.andP;  With CRTL-Tusers can manually switch between the two windows and the full screen or, ifpreferred, the debugging display can be redirected to another terminal.andO;Variables can be queried and modified, and trace and breakpoints can be set;the entire state of the debugger is stored when exited, so that the sessioncan be resumed after an edit and recompile of source code.andP;  The Informixdebugger is a master stroke, and anyone miffed at being shoehorned into doingeverything procedurally should be quieted by this facility.andM;In both the Unify and the Informix product, the traditional DBMSelements--the structure and language--are fundamentally the same.andP;  Thelanguages are strongly typed but contain specialized types (like DATE) thatmake this a bit easier to live with.andP;  Conversions between types, automaticand otherwise, are available, along with a smattering of string-handling andnumeric functions.andP;  Both languages support true functions that acceptarguments and return values.andM;The programmer first starting out with Informix's form design may be a bitboggled by the distinction it makes between fields on a form and fields in atable.andP;  Since they're usually named identically, a form definition can readlike an exercise in redundancy; only context determines how a name will beinterpreted.andP;  SQL is the foundation of both of these languages, and it's easyenough to learn.andP;  Those who have never seen SQL shouldn't place too muchstock in the claims that it is &quot;English-like&quot;--if you spoke in SQL, you'dlikely be put away.andP;  It works for databases, though, and tends to smooth outdifficult issues like multiple selection criteria.andM;Making the MoveandM;The two products reviewed here are not the only 4GLs available for UNIX, butthey do represent two very different approaches to the problem of simplifyingthe database-program development process.andP;  Unify's Accell stands out as thebest example of a fully integrated environment I've seen.andP;  It is hardly evernecessary to step outside Accell (or the underlying Unify RDBMS) to getsomething done.andP;  Because of this, businesspeople who want to design their owndatabases and reports would fare better with Unify's package.andP;  Using thetools provided and following the tutorials, a novice user can be developingdatabase programs in a few days.andP;  It wouldn't require knowledge of UNIXbeyond how to log in, and little more knowledge of database management thanone acquires in an &quot;Intro to Computer Science&quot; class.andM;The most serious flaw in Accell is its unusually demanding terminalinterface.andP;  The difficulty I had in configuring this function-key-ladensystem was nearly enough to turn me away from it before giving it a fairchance.andP;  Except for the function keys and lack of operation continuity acrossdifferent hardware, Accell's interface is superb.andP;  Buyers should take care tomake sure their terminals are compatible with Accell in advance, or be readywith a staffer qualified to generate specialized capability files forunsupported terminals.andM;Informix's RDS will appeal most to those who know Informix, and those whowish to learn it.andP;  The procedural language is simple enough for a programmerto learn, but I wouldn't put this product on a manager's desk and say, &quot;Usethis&quot;.andP;  What the RDS does best is help Informix programmers turn out betterprograms faster.andP;  Its interface is more primitive than Accell's, but adequatein its own right.andP;  A form painter would make the RDS more complete, but thesolid interactive debugger is a good tradeoff.andM;Other capabilities like high-level language interfaces and networking arepresent in both products.andP;  Suffice it to say that you can use both products'interface and database features from C (and other language) programs, andthat locking and concurrency control are part of both.andM;The best summary I can cast is to characterize Accell as a self-containedenvironment, a good way for the unfamiliar to get productive in the leastpossible time.andP;  It can be used straight off the shelf as long as you havecompatible terminals.andP;  Informix's RDS is more of a traditional developmentsystem, requiring considerable knowledge of the language before results canbe expected, but backing the experienced programmer with tools that make bugseasier to find and fix.andM;As with most comparisons, the best product would be a combination of the two.andO;i would add Informix's debugger and horizontal menus to Accell, and give thescreen painter and interactive environment to Informix.andP;  Even so, these aretwo good products, and developing a database program the old-fashioned wayseems foolish while there are tools such as these.andM;Tom Yager, this month's reviewer, has recently joined the editorial staff ofanother magazine, preaching UNIX to heathens undeserving of his zeal.andP;  Still,we wish him luck.andM;Richard Morin, column editor, operates Canta Forda Computer Laboratory, aconsulting firm in San Bruno, CA.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
