NOW! PC/HOST AUTOWARE 1.01andM;The Now! command language consists of more than 40 macros, which together doeverything from managing a host connection to creating an intelligent andintuitive user interface.andM;To use a host-connection macro, a machine must be running the High-LevelLanguage Application Programming Interface (HLLAPI), and the Low-LevelLanguage Interface used by the installed 3270 interface card must be loaded.andM;The program's command language supports memory and string variables, but ithas poor string-handling facilities and limited control logic.andP;  Now! programsare ASCII files and can be written with any word processor.andM;The package's six categories of macros include information-control macros,which perform math functions and assign variables; file-management macros,which open, read, write and print files, as well as handle uploads anddownloads; host-connection macros, which establish and maintainhost-communications sessions; and user-interface macros, which control thelook and feel of the screens.andM;Now! includes a limited editor that displays executing programs five lines ata time, a feature that can be helpful during debugging.andP;  It cannot record asession for future playback, however.andM;Although some programming experience is useful, a knowledgeable user couldquickly become productive with the software.andP;  This is due in part to Now!'swell-written and well-organized documentation, which contains examples foreach macro.andM;Attachmate also provides two utilities: NOWPACK, which packs and encrypts anAutoware program, and NOWMAP, which creates a cross-referenced index ofAutoware programs.andM;In addition, Attachmate runs an on-line bulletin board for users, offeringtechnical bulletins and Now! applications.andP;  A system operator replies totechnical questions.andM;Attachmate Corp., of Bellevue, Wash., can be reached at (800) 426-6283.andM;Buyers say ...andM;&quot;With the new release [1.01], Attachmate fixed some bugs, but in turn createda bug that has stopped me from using it,&quot; said Steve Verne, PC specialist forLitton Computer Services, a division of Litton Industries Inc., in AgoraHills, Calif.andM;&quot;Using the IBM emulation software, Attachmate's macros will ignore the hostsystem clock, which is the way the host says it's busy,&quot; Verne explained.andO;&quot;Because of this, Now! carries on processing when the host says it's notready for input.andM;&quot;Depending on what Now!'s going to do next [when the host becomes busy], itmay return an error or lose keystrokes that you wanted to send to the host,&quot;he said.andM;An Attachmate spokeswoman acknowledged that a small number of users have hadthis problem.andP;  She said the company plans to release a new version of Now! inJuly that should provide a solution.andP;  Also, users of Now! version 1.01 willbe able to purchase an upgrade in July, for an undetermined price, thatshould solve the problem, she said.andM;Now!'s user interface could also use improvement, Verne said.andP;  &quot;It hasrudimentary windowing and user input,&quot; he said.andM;Another buyer, Bob Castle, a systems analyst for the state of Oregon inSalem, won a state award for developing with Now!, he said.andP;  Using Now!andO;scripts that Castle wrote, other state employees are now able to complete inminutes some computer applications that once took hours.andM;Castle developed scripts, for example, that automated the process ofdownloading mainframe reports to PCs.andP;  &quot;Downloading once was a 24-stepprocess.andP;  It took users 45 minutes to download a simple file from themainframe,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Using Now!'s scripting, we cut it down to afive-minute process.&quot;andM;Castle also developed scripts to automate the state's payroll.andP;  &quot;The payrollprocess took forever,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I'd have to wake up on a weekend to come inand change a parameter.andM;&quot;I automated it so it could fetch in a program, edit it, stop and ask theuser to change a parameter, and continue on.andP;  The process went from six hoursdown to 45 minutes,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
