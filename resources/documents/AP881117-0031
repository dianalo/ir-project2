Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower says warnings byscientists about the so-called greenhouse effect requires ``stateleadership to think globally and act locally. Turning the corner ongreenhouse gases is too big to leave to the federal government.''   They and Tina Hobson, executive director of Renew America, citeda variety of steps for cutting the use of oil, coal and natural gas,the main sources of the carbon gases that experts say arecontributing to global warming.   Among the state-level actions they recommended at a newsconference Wednesday are encouraging greater use of masstransportation, planting trees to absorb carbon and using taxincentives and building codes to spur more efficient energyconsumption.   Hobson unveiled a study by Renew America, an environmentalresearch and advocacy organization, showing that Hightower's stateof Texas was the clearcut leader among U.S. states in carbon gasproduction in 1986.   Its 154.87 million metric tons amounted to about 12 percent ofthe 1.275 billion metric tons of carbons pumped into the atmospherethat year by the United States, the world's largest producer ofcarbons and other greenhouse gases.   Renew America said this country is responsible for about 25percent of the world's carbon emissions, coal and natural gas,meaning Texas is the source of about 3 percent of global carbonloadings to the atmosphere.   Carbons represent about half of the greenhouse gases that manyscientists say are accumulating in the atmosphere, trapping thesun's heat and threatening the planet with rising ocean levels andmajor climate changes.   In what was billed as the first state-by-state breakdown ofcarbon emissions, Renew America said that largely rural Vermont wasthe nation's lowest contributor to carbon emissions, with 1.31million metric tons in 1986.   Renew America said it compiled its figures from fuel-use datacollected by the Department of Energy and had its report reviewed byofficials from the Environmental Protection Agency andprivate-sector researchers, including Woodwell.   The overall findings were not startling. They showed a generalcorrelation between a state's population and industrial activity andits production of carbon gases.   Texas, with a large concentration of oil refineries and chemicalplants, was No. 1 in carbon emissions from oil and natural gas _ thecleanest burning fossil fuel _ and No. 3 in emissions from coal.   California was second overall in 1986, producing 85.23 millionmetric tons of carbons. Three out of every four tons came from useof oil, reflecting the state's huge number of vehicles.   Other heavy producers of carbon emissions were Ohio, 67.21million metric tons; Pennsylvania, 65.57; Illinois, 55.04;Louisiana, 51.73; New York, 49.57; Indiana, 49.13; Michigan, 47.12;and Florida, 43.55.   Renew America also calculated how many tons of carbon a statereleased in relation to its economy. West Virginia, a depressed areadominated by coal use and chemical plants, had the worst showing:1,179 tons for each $1 million in gross state product.   Texas, Indiana and Louisiana were the only states among the top10 carbon producers and the bottom 10 in the ratio of tonnage togross state product.   New York had the best economic-ratio showing, producing 137 tonsfor every $1 million of gross state product. California's tonnagewas 160 per $1 million, compared to a national average of 306 tonsfor each $1 million.</TEXT></DOC>
