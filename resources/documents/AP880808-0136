Pakistan officials meanwhile refused to confirm or denynewspaper accounts that the Islamabad government was holding aSoviet pilot shot down last week.   Authorities at the northwest border village of Parachinar saidthe two Afghan fliers landed their fully armed plane, handed oversidearms and asked for asylum.   They said the men told Parachinar airport security that they,along with another two fighters, had been sent from Kabul to bombMoslem guerrilla positions in eastern Paktia province. While theothers attacked Paktia, the pilot swerved his aircraft towardPakistan, they said.   Airport security fired on the MiG, fearing it was coming in tobomb the airport although the pilot, identified as Maj. Munir, andthe other airman, Capt. Wazir, advised the control tower theywanted to defect.   They circled the airport four times before they were allowed toland, local authorities said. The fighter was loaded with rocketsand bombs.   Newspaper reports said a Soviet airman was flown to Islamabad,the Pakistani capital, after surviving the downing of his Su-20ground attack fighter by a U.S.-built Pakistan air force F-16 lastThursday. The plane reportedly was shot down near the bordervillage of Miranshah.   Over the course of the 10-year war in neighboring Afghanistan, ahalf-dozen Afghan pilots have defected to Pakistan with theiraircraft. This was the first defection reported since the Sovietsbegan their withdrawal from Afghanistan on May 15.   Cross-border incursions in Pakistani airspace have occurredfrequently during the long conflict between the Marxist governmentin Kabul and Islamic guerrillas.   An air force official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said``there has been some increase'' since the signing of an April 14agreement providing for the phased withdrawal of more than 100,000Soviet soldiers from Afghanistan.   Guerrilla reports from North Waziristan, where Miranshah islocated, said four Afghan refugees were killed last Wednesday whena Soviet or Afghan fighter jet bombed Pakistani territory.</TEXT></DOC>
