(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A TV movie about the Challenger disasterhas upset and offended those closest to Christa McAuliffe, the NewHampshire schoolteacher who died in the shuttle explosion.   Among the critics are McAuliffe's mother, Grace Corrigan, andConcord Mayor James MacKay, who said the film reduced him to tears.Mrs. Corrigan and McKay said the movie failed to captureMcAuliffe's personality.   Mrs. Corrigan, of Framingham, Mass., said at first it wasdifficult to watch a screening of ``Challenger,'' which will airSunday on ABC.   ``It started to upset me, then I said, `No, I'm not going to letit because it is only a video,''' she said in a telephone interviewthis week.   Mrs. Corrigan, whose husband, Edward, died this year and wasburied four years to the day after the Jan. 28, 1986, Challengerexplosion, said actress Karen Allen failed in her attempt toportray McAuliffe.   ``I didn't feel it was Christa, but I didn't think it wouldbe,'' she said.   MacKay complained that the movie invaded the McAuliffe family'sprivacy, and also said Allen's portrayal of the former teacher ``inno way caught the depth'' of McAuliffe's personality.   MacKay said the film conjured up painful images of theill-fated, 73-second flight and was difficult for him to watch.   ``The whole thing was very emotional to me,'' MacKay said. ``Istarted to cry at several points.''   McAuliffe, a Concord High School social studies teacher who wasthe first private citizen chosen to fly in space, died with sixother crew members.   Bob Hohler, a reporter for The Boston Globe and author of ``ITouch the Future: The Story of Christa McAuliffe,'' said he thoughtthe movie was ``pretty bad.''   ``It just was a pretty powerful moment in history reduced to adull docudrama. It's real superficial,'' Hohler said. ``It cheapenshistory when it becomes so superficial.''   Writer-producer George Englund said he knew there would be mixedreactions to the film but defended it as ``sensitive in almostevery aspect.''   NASA officials said the agency has taken no formal position onthe movie, but two spokesmen said they believe sentiment at NASAuns against the film.   ``It's the sort of thing that basically we think is probably toosoon to be done,'' said Hugh Harris, deputy director of publicaffairs at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla.   ``If I were guessing, people who were not involved at NASA willfind it a very touching film, but there will be some people at NASAwho feel it cuts close to the bone,'' said Bill Sheehan, NASAassociate administrator for communication in Washington.   Englund said any movie about the disaster was bound to causedebate.   ``I can understand why some people would think it's too soon,''he said. ``But ... I don't know if there ever would have been aconsensus about the time.''</TEXT></DOC>
