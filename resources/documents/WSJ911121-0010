Atrue statement, but the implication is that people are beingdenied their inalienable rights. Then the emotional kicker isadded: &quot;Most important, the practice can leave the sickwithout access to insurance, at a time when they need itmost.&quot;   You seem oblivious to the elementary underwritingprinciple of &quot;adverse selection.&quot; Long before Mr. Lloydopened his coffeehouse in London, underwriters weredisinclined to knowingly insure sinking ships. Windstorminsurance is notably hard to procure when a hurricane is 20miles offshore. The truth of the matter is that lifeunderwriters have handled AIDS exactly as they always havehandled fatal diseases. Blood tests and all sorts of othermedical information were being required by life underwriterslong before AIDS.</LP><TEXT>   Had life-insurance management not protected the assets oftheir policyholders and stockholders from the adverseselection of HIV-infected applicants, they would have beenguilty of gross malfeasance. Had AIDS-infected people beenallowed to buy all the life insurance they wanted, more thanone life-insurance company would be bankrupt today. Howsocially responsible would that have been? Actually, thedebate is so silly it is difficult to argue seriously.   The life-insurance industry is one of the few elements inour society that has treated AIDS for what it is, apublic-health issue, instead of a political question.   William N.
