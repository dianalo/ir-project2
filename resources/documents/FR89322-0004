Additionalamendments to Regulation D also have been made. While the filing of FormD has been retained, it will no longer be a condition to any exemptionunder Regulation D. New Rule 507 will disqualify any issuer found to haveviolated the Form D filing requirement from future use of Regulation D.New Rule 508 provides that an exemption from the registration requirementswill be available for an offer or sale to a particular individual or entity,despite failure to comply with a requirement of Regulation D, if the requirementis not designed to protect specifically the complaining person; the failureto comply is insignificant to the offering as a whole; and there has beena good faith and reasonable attempt to comply with all requirements ofthe regulation. Rule 508 specifies that the provisions of Regulation Drelating to general solicitation, the dollar limits of Rules 504 and 505and the limits of non-accredited investors in Rules 505 and 506 are deemedsignificant to every offering and therefore not subject to the Rule 508defense. Further, the rule specifies that any failure to comply with aprovision of Regulation D is actionable by the Commission under the SecuritiesAct.\1\<NOTE/> Changes in those requirements designed to reflect the ``restricted''character of securities issued in a Regulation D transaction also havebeen adopted.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 77a <T3>et seq</T3>.; in particular section 20 thereof, 15 U.S.C. 77t.Additional new amendments to Regulation D revise the definitional provisions,relating to ``aggregate offering price'', the calculation of the numberof purchasers, and ``purchaser representative'' to codify staff interpretivepositions. Revisions also are adopted with respect to the informationalrequirements of Regulation D. Another amendment explicitly recognizes thatan offering to the appropriate number of and/or sophistication of investorsis acceptable, whether or not the issuer has a reasonable basis to believethat such is the case.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>April 19, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Richard K.

Amendments to Regulation D</ITAG>A. Accredited Investors ReleaseThe Commission initially proposed adding certain plans established andmaintained by the governments of the states and their political subdivisions,as well as their agencies and instrumentalities for the benefit of theiremployees to the list of accredited investors \4\<NOTE/> in March 1988.\5\<NOTE/> This addition to the list of accredited investors was proposedbecause the language contained in the existing definition limits its coverageto plans ``within the meaning'' of Title I of the Employee Retirement IncomeSecurity Act of 1974 (``ERISA'').\6\<NOTE/> Since government plans are exempted from ERISA, they havenot been considered to be accredited investors within the meaning of therule. As initially proposed, a plan would have been deemed accredited ifits trustee were a bank, savings and loan association, insurance companyor registered investment adviser, and if the plan imposed standards offiduciary responsibility similar to those imposed under ERISA. Commenterson this proposal felt that such plans should be accredited but took substantialissue with the criteria proposed, urging instead a standard similar tothat imposed on ERISA plans, <T3>i.e., </T3>some asset-based test.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The definition of ``accredited investor'' is the samefor both section 4(6) and Regulation D transactions. Section 2(15) of theSecurities Act and Rule 215, 17 CFR 230.215, provide the identical listingof investors as Rule 501(a). Amendments are being made today to Rule 215to maintain the consistency.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Release No. 33-6759 (March 3, 1988) [53 FR 7870].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ 29 U.S.C. 1101 <T3>et seq.</T3>In the Accredited Investor Release, the Commission, responding to thesesuggestions, proposed to include within the definition of the term ``accreditedinvestors'' those governmental employee benefit plans that have total assetsin excess of $5 million. All of the public commenters on this issue supportedthe Commission's proposal. The amendment being adopted today places governmentalplans on the same footing as employee plans which are subject to ERISA.B. 508 Release_New Rules 507 and 508 and Various Procedural Revisions toRegulation DIn the 508 Release, the Commission published for comment reproposals ofnew Rules 507 and 508, and new proposed amendments to various provisionsof the regulation. Rules 507 and 508 had been initially proposed for commentin March 1988.<ITAG tagnum="81">(1) New Rule 507</ITAG>The proposals to eliminate the Form D \7\<NOTE/> filing requirement as a condition to every Regulation D exemptionand the Rule 507 disqualification provisions were favorably received bythe public commenters. These revisions have been adopted without change.The Rule 503 requirement to file a Form D within 15 days of the first saleof securities remains, but will no longer be a condition to the establishmentof any exemption under Regulation D. Rule 507 will serve as a disqualificationto the use of Regulation D for future transactions by any issuer, if it,or a predecessor or affiliate, has been enjoined by a court for violatingthe filing obligation established by Rule 503. The Commission has the authorityto waive a disqualification upon a showing of good cause.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ 17 CFR 239.500.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ In order to facilitate the processing of waiver requestsunder this provision, the Commission has delegated authority to the Directorof the Division of Corporation Finance to grant such applications in appropriatecases, and has amended its delegation of authority rules in this regard.The Commission finds, in accordance with section 553(b) of the AdministrativeProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b), that this action relates solely to agencyorganization, procedure or practice and thus obviates the necessity fornotice and prior publication.<ITAG tagnum="81">(2) New Rule 508</ITAG>As reproposed in December, Rule 508 provided that failure to comply witha term, condition or requirement of Regulation D would not cause a lossof the exemption for any offer or sale to a particular individual or entityif the person relying on the exemption were to demonstrate that (1) theterm, condition or requirement violated was not directly intended to protectthe complaining party, (2) the failure to comply was insignificant to theoffering as a whole, and (3) a good faith and reasonable attempt was madeto comply with all of the regulation's terms, conditions and requirements.In a separate provision, proposed Rule 508 indicated that any failure tocomply would, nevertheless, be actionable by the Commission.\9\<NOTE/> With regard to significance to the offering as a whole, theCommission proposal specifically indicated that the conditions relatingto dollar ceilings, numerical purchaser limits and general solicitationwould always be deemed significant and therefore beyond the protectionof the rule.\10\<NOTE/> The public comments supported the Commission proposal andRule 508 has been adopted without change.\11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ <T3>See </T3>section 20 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77t.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ 17 CFR 230.502(c), 230.504(b)(2)(i), 230.505(b)(2)((i),(ii), and 230.506(b)(2)(i).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Several of the commenters objected to the eliminationof certain items from the coverage of insignificance; another objectedto the insignificance to the offering as a whole concept.In excluding general solicitation from the ambit of the Rule 508 defense,the Commission reiterates its view, expressed in the 508 Release, that,inasmuch as general solicitation is not defined in Regulation D, the questionof whether or not particular activities constitute a general solicitationmust always be determined in the context of the particular facts and circumstancesof each case. Thus, for example, if an offering is structured so that onlypersons with whom the issuer and its agents have had a prior relationship\12\<NOTE/> are solicited, the fact that one potential investor withwhom there is no such prior relationship is called may not necessarilyresult in a general solicitation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ The Commission's staff has issued a number of interpretiveletters concerning the general solicitation requirement which have involvedprior relationships, <T3>e.g., In re </T3>Mineral Lands Research and Marketing Corp. (November4, 1985). The staff has never suggested, and it is not the case, that priorrelationship is the only way to show the absence of a general solicitation.<ITAG tagnum="81">(3) Definitions</ITAG>The Commission also proposed a number of revisions to the definitionalprovisions of Rule 501 to codify staff interpretations and to reduce ambiguitiesin the regulation. For example, the Commission proposed to amend the definitionof ``aggregate offering price'' to indicate that payments made in a foreigncurrency would be translatable into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate ineffect within a reasonable time period prior to or on the date of the saleof securities. The proposed amendments would also have provided that valuations,which must be made prior to the sale of the securities, of non-cash considerationmust be reasonable when they are made.The definition of the manner in which the number of purchasers in a Rule505 or Rule 506 offering should be calculated would be clarified underthe proposed amendments. Thus, when a corporation, partnership or otherentity must be pierced through to its beneficial owners because it hasbeen formed for the specific purpose of making an investment, the provisionsof Rule 501(e)(1) governing exclusions from the calculation, such as thoseapplicable to related parties sharing the same household, would apply tothe beneficial owners. The Commission also proposed to revise the definitionof ``purchaser representative'' so that disclosure of material conflictsof interest might be made a reasonable time before purchase rather than(as currently required) prior to the purchaser's acknowledgement of thepurchaser representative as his agent.Commenters endorsed the proposed revisions and the amendments have beenadopted as proposed.<ITAG tagnum="81">(4) Information Requirements</ITAG>The Commission also proposed to eliminate the requirement to provide specifieddisclosure to an accredited investor whenever one or more purchasers inthe transaction are non-accredited investors. Additional amendments wereproposed to clarify that non-accredited investors must be advised of, andfurnished upon request, all material information furnished to accreditedinvestors. Under the proposed amendments, required information would haveto be furnished a reasonable time prior to sale. Finally, the Commissionproposed that written disclosure of resale restrictions be required tobe provided to all non-accredited investors in Rule 505 and 506 offerings.In general, the commenters supported these proposals.\13\<NOTE/> These revisions will remove uncertainties in the terminologyof the regulation and ensure that those investors most likely to be unawareof the transfer restrictions applicable to most Regulation D securitieshave written information in this regard. These provisions have been adoptedas proposed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ Several of the commenters objected to the impositionof the writing requirement on resale restrictions.The amendment with regard to Rule 502(b)(2)(i)(D) concerning the certificationrequirements for certain foreign issuers also has been adopted, eliminatinga confusing reference to inapplicable disclosure standards.<ITAG tagnum="81">(5) Demonstrating the ``Restricted'' Nature of the Securities</ITAG>Under the Commission's proposal in the 508 Release, the list of actionsformerly required by Rule 502(d) in order to demonstrate reasonable carethat purchasers in a Regulation D transaction are not underwriters, <T3>i.e., </T3>purchaser inquiry, written notification and legending, wouldhave become a non-exclusive method of satisfying the provision. The commentersalso supported this provision. Rule 502(d) has thus been amended as proposed.<ITAG tagnum="81">(6) Revisions to Rule 504</ITAG>Rule 504 provides an exemption for offerings by companies which are neitherreporting companies under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934 \1\\4\<NOTE/> nor investment companies registered or required to be registeredunder the Investment Company Act of 1940 \1\\5\<NOTE/> for up to $1 million. In the 508 Release, the Commissionproposed to add a requirement that an issuer provide purchasers in a Rule504 transaction written disclosure of any resale restrictions and thisrequirement is being adopted today. In discussing this requirement in the508 Release, the Commission noted that the provision would make it impossibleto rely on Rule 504 to provide an exemption for an issue that otherwisewould comply with the conditions of the exemption, albeit inadvertently.Commenters were asked to address the question as to whether, at least undersome circumstances (such as a transaction involving a limited number ofparticipants or a small amount of money) the delivery of such a writtenstatement need not be required. The North American Securities AdministratorsAssociation, Inc. (``NASAA'') and others urged the Commission to adoptthe provision as proposed.\1\\6\<NOTE/> While the Commission continues to believe that such an exclusionmay be appropriate, it is persuaded that the regulation should be amendedas proposed and that, as suggested in the NASAA comment letter, the statesand the Commission should work together to develop a mutually acceptableresolution of the issue. In any case, the availability of the statutoryexemption under section 4(2) of the Securities Act is unaffected by today'saction on this matter.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ 15 U.S.C. 78m, 780 (d).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ 15 U.S.C. 80a-1 <T3>et seq</T3>.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ ``[W]e strongly urge the Commission accept the proposedRule 504 without further modification, and if the Commission considersthe matter to be of sufficient importance, that it be the subject of furtherdiscussions. Since both the Commission and NASAA are in basic agreementthat rules should not have the effect of penalizing the small, innocentofferor and further, that rules should not have the effect of facilitatingfraudulent activity, such discussions may may produce a mutually acceptableresolution of this issue.'' Letter from NASAA dated February 21, 1989,contained in File No. S7-4-88. <ITAG tagnum="81">(7) Revisions to Rules 505 and 506</ITAG>The Commission also proposed to amend Rules 505 and 506 to reflect expresslythe staff interpretations that the requirements of those rules are satisfiedwhether or not the issuer had a reasonable belief as to the number of non-accreditedinvestors or their sophistication, as long as the number and sophisticationrequirements are in fact met. No objections were raised with regard tothese proposals by the commenters. The changes have been made as proposed.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. NASAA Cooperation </ITAG>The Commission is pleased to acknowledge the continuing cooperation ofNASAA.\1\\7\<NOTE/> Because Regulation D serves as the core for the Uniform LimitedOffering Exemption (``ULOR''),\1\\8\<NOTE/> an official policy guideline of NASSA,\1\\9\<NOTE/> this cooperation is essential to continuing the uniformitybetween Federal and State exemptive systems envisions by the Congressionalmandate set forth in section 19(c) of the Securities Act.\2\\0\<NOTE/> The Commission understands that the membership of NASAA hassupported the amendments to Regulation D being made today. Further, amendmentsto ULOE are presently being formulated by the NASAA Small Business CapitalFormation Committee incorporating these amendments and, where appropriate,making additional changes which apply the principles reflected in theseamendments. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ NASAA is an association of the securities administratorsof each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and severalof the Canadian provinces. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ CCH NASAA Rep. andpara;6201 at 6101.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ An official policy guideline represents endorsementof a a principle which NASSA believes has general application.

Availability of Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>A final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis regarding the revisions to RegulationD has been prepared in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act.A summary of the corresponding Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analyseswere included in the Accredited Investor Release and the 508 Release, respectively.Members of the public who wish to obtain a copy of the final RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis should contact Twanna Young in the Office of SmallBusiness Policy, Division of Corporation Finance, U.S. Securities and ExchangeCommission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Cost-Benefit Analysis </ITAG>No specific data was provided on the Commission's request for costs andbenefits of the proposals. Nonetheless, all of the amendments which aredesigned to facilitate compliance or reduce regulatory burden should providesignificant benefits to issuers, reduce their costs of compliance withouthaving a significant impact upon the protection of investors. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Conforming Amendment to the Description of Form D </ITAG>On October 2, 1986, the Commission adopted significant changes to FormD and its filing requirements.\2\\1\<NOTE/> Through an oversight, the description of the Form containedin the Code of Federal Regulations was not similarly revised. The Commissionis making the conforming amendments at this time. Because this action isa conforming amendment that involves no substantive change, the Commissionfinds that there is good cause to dispense with the prior notice and publicprocedure of the Administrative Procedure Act,\2\\2\<NOTE/> which is unnecessary under these circumstances since priornotice was given and public comment received on the substance of the changebefore the amendments were adopted in 1986.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ Release No. 33-6663 (October 2, 1986) (51 FR 36385).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b).<ITAG tagnum="84">VI.
