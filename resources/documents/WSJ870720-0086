That's what this KKR offer represents.&quot;    Analysts say the big home building and building-materials concern, based in Tampa, Fla., is especially attractive as a leveraged buyout because its structure of independent units would make it relatively simple to break up operations for sale.    In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired by a small group of investors, financed largely by debt. Ultimately, the group's borrowings are repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    &quot;It's fairly diversified with free-standing units,&quot; Mr. Stanley said of Jim Walter. &quot;It would be easy to sell things without unraveling the structure.&quot;    Henry Kravis, managing general partner of Kohlberg Kravis, a New York investment banking firm that specializes in leveraged buyouts, said simply that Jim Walter is &quot;a good company with good products and good management.&quot; Asked what assets might be disposed of after a leveraged buyout, Mr. Kravis said, &quot;We've not made any decisions on anything.&quot;    Jim Walter builds low-priced homes, for which it also provides mortgage financing. It also makes building materials and pressure pipes, distributes paper, sells jewelry, and has interests in mining, gas and oil.    Some analysts think that its large natural-resources division may be suitable for sale because it's somewhat outside the company's traditional lines of business and generates substantial cash flow. Others said that its building-materials operations, which make a host of products such as roofing materials, insulation, gypsum, crushed stone, window material and cast iron, could be sold at a premium.    &quot;The attraction to KKR is they would have a number of alternatives,&quot; about which operations to sell, said Harry G. Katica, an analyst with J.W. Charles-Bush Securities Inc., Boca Raton, Fla., who noted that besides its diversified and profitable operations, Jim Walter also has a $3.3 billion mortgage portfolio &quot;that is probably the crown jewel of the company.&quot; With a yield to maturity of more than 17%, the mortgage portfolio, carried at $1.1 billion, &quot;could be quickly sold for $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion,&quot; he said.    As previously reported, Jim Walter said it regarded Kohlberg Kravis's $50-a-share bid as friendly and appointed a special committee of outside directors of its board to evaluate the offer. On Friday, the company said that committee had selected Shearson Lehman Brothers as its financial adviser.    The proposal pushed the shares up $12.50 to $58 on Thursday, far above Kohlberg Kravis's bid, indicating Wall Street views the offer as an opening volley. Several Wall Street analysts guessed the bidding could climb as high as $60 a share or slightly more.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Jim Walter closed at $57.25, down 75 cents.    &quot;Fifty dollars (a share) is a very low bid,&quot; said Mr. Katica. &quot;I put the break-apart value of the company at $58.45. I think that's the absolute minimum that should be accepted. I'd like to see it valued at 15 times (projected) earnings,&quot; he said, adding that that would be about $61 a share.    Analysts said the company has done a good job of reducing costs, widening profit margins, and spurring a strong earnings momentum since emerging from the 1982 recession.    In the nine months ended May 31, Jim Walter earned $112.6 million, or $2.77 a share, as adjusted for a 25% stock dividend distributed July 12, on revenue of $1.72 billion. In the year-earlier period, it reported net income of $88.5 million on revenue of $1.71 billion.    On Friday, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said that in light of the leveraged buyout proposal, it placed under review for possible downgrade $753 million of long-term debt of Jim Walter and the company's commercial paper. Moody's said its review is concentrating on the potential impact of the increased debt on the company's capital structure and future profitability.    Moody's said the review covers the company's Baa-1 senior debt rating, its Baa-2 subordinated debt rating, and its Prime-2 rating for commercial paper. </TEXT></DOC>
