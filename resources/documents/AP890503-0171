PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   GTE Florida Inc. is sending workersdoor-to-door in portions of two counties this week to collecttelephone books that mistakenly included the address of a spouseabuse shelter.   The company said about 30,000 books were recalled in Pasco andPinellas counties. Another 60,000 directories were printed with theerror but never distributed, said GTE public affairs manager BruceKotchey.   Distribution began last Thursday. GTE ordered the recall Fridayafter learning the address, which the shelter requested not belisted, was included.   GTE feared angry husbands would be able to find the center andattack women who went there for help, Kotchey said. The spokesmanblamed the mistake on ``human error somewhere along the line.''   The phone company hopes to begin distribution in two weeks ofcorrected directories.   GTE representatives and directors of the shelter are discussingways, including additional shelter security, to blunt the effectsof the listing, Kotchey said.</TEXT></DOC>
