Trading was quiet, with most U.S. banks closed for the Veterans Day holiday. Government offices and most banks in France also were closed for a holiday.    &quot;It's like being at work on a Saturday,&quot; Elizabeth Monaghan, vice president of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York, said. &quot;It's a silly market to participate in if you don't have to.&quot;    Several New York traders said they cautiously executed relatively small transactions, making sure their exposure to market fluctuations was tightly checked.    The dollar's modest gains brought the U.S. currency further back from Tuesday's record low of 1.6490 West German marks and 40-year low of 133.22 Japanese yen. The currency reached intraday highs of 1.6770 marks and 135.40 yen before slipping back to 1.6760 marks and 135.10 yen in late New York trading.    In early Tokyo trading Thursday, the dollar was quoted at 134.78 yen.    Its moderate comeback began Tuesday after President Reagan said he doesn't want the dollar to decline further.    The currency began to rise again yesterday after the White House scheduled a news conference, as some traders began speculating that the president might make a further statement in support of the dollar. Instead, Mr. Reagan announced the nomination of federal Judge Anthony M. Kennedy to the U.S. Supreme Court.    For most currency traders, the market remains a tale of two deficits: the U.S. trade deficit, which will be measured again today when the September merchandise trade report is released; and the U.S. budget deficit, in which the White House and Congress are trying to negotiate cuts.    Four weeks ago, a report of a wider-than-expected $15.68 billion trade deficit for August sent the dollar sharply lower and was soon followed by Black Monday's 22.6% stock market crash. Analysts and traders generally expect a September deficit of $14 billion to $15 billion. But many say the figure has been overtaken in importance by the U.S. budget deficit.    &quot;Obviously, we're looking to see whether the U.S. trade numbers show any improvement,&quot; Ken Delasalle, senior foreign exchange manager at National Westminster Bank PLC, London, said. &quot;But the budget deficit is the focus.&quot;    Ms. Monaghan agrees. &quot;The budget deficit is absolutely pre-eminent,&quot; she said. &quot;The trade number is an accounting of history, but the budget deficit is the key to the future.&quot;    After holding talks yesterday, White House and congressional budget negotiators said they were closer to an agreement. The two sides agreed to meet again today.    Until the budget talks produce concrete results, however, the dollar is likely to continue slipping, traders said.    Ian Spence, vice president, foreign exchange, at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said that despite the dollar's recent small gains, he expects the currency to continue &quot;a more or less orderly decline&quot; through the end of the year. He predicted that the dollar will slip into ranges of 1.55 to 1.60 marks and 127 to 130 yen in the next six weeks.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery gained 90 cents an ounce to $461.90 in light trading. Volume was estimated at 2.4 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $462.15 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                     Late New York Trading                   Wednesday, Nov. 11, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
