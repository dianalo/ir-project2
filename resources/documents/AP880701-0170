STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Manfred Woerner, NATO's new secretarygeneral, has a dapper and often combative style that led to afashion magazine cover and scandal over the firing of a generalfalsely accused of homosexual contacts.   Woerner, who is NATO's seventh general secretary since the postwas created in 1952, took over the alliance's highest civilian poston Friday. He was the first West German appointed to the post.   The 53-year-old former West German defense minister replacesBritain's Lord Carrington, who held the job since June 1984.   His appointment followed a failed bid by Norway to have itsformer prime minister, Kaare Willoch, named to the post.   Nominees are generally agreed upon in negotiations between theEuropean allies, and the tussle sparked a rare public dispute thatembarrassed officials at the alliance's Brussels headquarters.   Early in his political career, the former West German air forcepilot created a dashing image for himself. He was oftenphotographed climbing into the cockpit of a Fiat G91 fighter orrelaxing in sports cars.   During his parlimentary career, Woerner retained his reputationas a stylish public official with a knack for oratory.   In 1977, the Duesseldorf-based Der Herr men's fashion magazinefeatured him in a cover photo and story.   But the air force reserve colonel is also known for his penchantfor combativeness and controversy.   In a 1970 budget speech to the Bundestag, or West Germanparliament, his attacks on the then-governing Social Democraticgovernment were so stinging that former Chancellor Willy Brandtstormed out of the session.   Woerner was also the subject of intense public debate in 1983and early 1984 over a widely publicized scandal involving hisfiring of a top NATO general, Guenter Kiessling.   The defense minister dismissed the West German general followingreports that alleged he had frequented homosexual bars in Cologne.   The rumors were subsequently proven false, forcing Woerner toreinstate Kiessling one month after his dismissal.   During the scandal, Woerner survived repeated calls for hisresignation by opposition leaders.   Woerner was born in Stuttgart, the son of a prosperous textileretailer. As a child, he belonged to the Jungvolk, a junior branchof the Hitler Youth organization.   He has a doctorate in international law and was voted into theBundestag in 1965. He served four years as the Christian Democrats'party chairman and has been a member of its national executivecommittee since 1973.   Woerner was defense minister for nearly six years.   He is fluent in English and French, NATO's official languages.   The new NATO secretary has said he regards narrowing the Sovietsuperiority in conventional arms as the key challenge for NATO.   He is also a proponent of plans for closer Franco-West Germandefense cooperation and opposes the withdrawal of all nuclearweapons from Western Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
