MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new age of harmony in foreign policy is goingto be elusive and fragile, even with the Republican White House andthe Senate's top Democrat working to create it.   It will take more than bipartisanship because the most divisiveand intractable policy disputes of the era were not partisan in thefirst place. They hinged instead on the powers of Congress and theExecutive Branch to make or risk war in a time of limited conflicts,surgical strikes, terrorism and, most recently, naval escortmissions for reflagged Kuwaiti ships in the Persian Gulf.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said defense is aresponsibility shared by the president and Congress ``but in recentyears it sometimes seemed as if we were opposing each other ratherthan exercising shared powers. That need not be.''   His words meshed with President's Bush's inaugural call for a newera of cooperation and unity.   The challenge is to define the shared powers so as to satisfyCongress without intruding on authority presidents always havereserved as their own.   Mitchell said bipartisanship ``cannot be made real by wordsalone, or by good intentions.   ``It requires deeds to match words, action to carry out intention... shared responsibility.''   The new majority leader asked Bush to make Congress ``a partnerin policy formulation,'' acknowledging that even that won't preventdifferences between the two branches of government. ``But in thegreat eras of American leadership, the differences have been lessimportant than the agreements,'' Mitchell said.   A generation ago, a Democratic administration and anoverwhelmingly Democratic Congress clashed in the dispute that gaverise to the rest _ the undeclared war in Vietnam.   ``That war cleaves us still,'' Bush said in his inauguraladdress. ``But friends, that war began in earnest a quarter of acentury ago and surely the statute of limitations has beenreached...''   Five years after that divisive war drove President Lyndon B.Johnson into retirement, Congress sought to assert its authoritywith the war powers resolution, sponsored by a liberal Republicansenator, vetoed by a Republican president, overridden by aDemocratic Congress. It says that presidents can't sent U.S. forcesinto potential war zones for more than 90 days unless Congressapproves.   That remains on the books, never fully invoked but often debated.The issue is power, not partisanship. Presidents inevitably guardwhat they deem to be the prerogatives of a commander in chief.   Since the war powers resolution was adopted in 1973 over the vetoof Richard M. Nixon, two more Republican presidents and one Democrathave argued as he did that it is unconstitutional and can undermineU.S. action in time of crisis.   The war powers resolution requires that the president notifyCongress within 48 hours whenever he sends combat-ready troopsoverseas. When they are sent into conflict or ``situations whereimminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated,'' theymust be withdrawn within 60 days unless Congress votes to keep themthere, 90 days if the president certifies in writing that the extratime is vital to safe withdrawal.   That law never has been fully invoked, although often debated.Critics of President Reagan's escort policy in the Persian Gulftried seven times to get congressional action that would havecompelled the administration to invoke the act. Then they went tocourt and lost there, too. The administration insisted war powersdidn't apply, even after 37 sailors were killed when an Iraqimissile hit the U.S.S. Stark.   Only Congress has the power to declare war. But that hasn'thappened since the United States entered World War II the day afterPearl Harbor. Korea and Vietnam were undeclared wars. Situationslike those in Lebanon, Grenada, the attack on Libya defy even thatdescription.   ``...We find that we are drawn into smaller conflicts where thelines between active hostilities and uneasy truce are unclear,''Mitchell said. ``That was the case in the Persian Gulf last year. Itwill be the case in other places in the future.   ``Our system should ensure that when force is necessary, it isused surely and for goals clear to all of us,'' he said.   Mitchell said that was the idea behind the war powers resolution,but that it has become a point of contention and stalemate. Leadersof both parties want it revised, probably eliminating the withdrawaldeadlines in favor of regular White House consultation with adesignated panel of Congressional leaders on national securitypolicy.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter R.
