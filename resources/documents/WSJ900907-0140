Cardiomyopathy recently came to national attention when itcaused the death of Loyola Marymount University basketballstar Hank Gathers, who collapsed March 4 during a game. Thedisease, which can stem from viral infection, alcohol abuseand other factors besides faulty genes, can cause irregularheartbeat, decreased cardiac pumping power and heart failure.The cause of Mr. Gathers's cardiomyopathy hasn't beenidentified.</LP><TEXT>   The latest finding pinpointed the gene behind a rare,inherited form of the disease and should enable scientists todevelop a genetic test to diagnose it early in such cases.That may enable doctors to mitigate the disease with drugs --there presently is no cure for it. Researchers also hope thefinding eventually will help them develop better treatmentsfor cardiomyopathy.   An international team of scientists led by Harvard MedicalSchool researchers Christine and Jonathan Seidman reportedthat the gene responsible for the inherited cardiomyopathyproduces a heart muscle protein called the myosin heavychain. Myosin plays a central role in muscle tissue's abilityto contract. &quot;It was very much a surprise that the myosingene&quot; was involved in the disease, said Christine Seidman, acardiologist. &quot;One doubted that a molecule as critical asthat (could be faulty) and still permit survival.&quot;   The researchers, who reported their discovery in today'sissue of the journal Cell, found that different families inwhich inherited cardiomyopathy occurs have different defectsin the myosin gene. The genetic basis of the disease isfurther complicated by recent findings that show geneticdefects not involving myosin can also cause cardiomyopathy,Dr. Seidman said.</TEXT></DOC>
