But Ruediger von Rosen, executive vice chairman of theFederation of German Stock Exchanges, said he would prefer ifthe major European stock markets would cooperate in the PriceInformation Project Europe, a pan-European screen-basedsecurities-trading system.</LP><TEXT>   Such a cooperation would cut the cost of information andfacilitate the creation of a unified European market placefor the trading of blue-chip shares, the official said inremarks prepared for the Financial Markets Group Conferenceat the London School of Economics. A text of the speech wasmade available in Frankfurt.   Seaq, which handles around 12% of the trading volume inthe key German blue-chip stocks, launched a marketingcampaign to install its monitors in Frankfurt bank offices,which would permit traders to conduct their business directlyon the London exchange.   In return, the German exchanges could offer their new Ibissystem to traders outside West Germany once it has beenexpanded into a full-fledged trading system able to handlestocks and bonds from all major European markets, Mr. vonRosen said. Ibis's main advantage over Seaq and other systemsis its direct line to the German Central SecuritiesDepository, which permits automatic clearing and settlementwithin a two-day period, he said.   But such a strategy would result in a situation wheretraders are surrounded by monitors from Ibis, Seaq, theFrench CAC system, and even the U.S. Nasdaq network, Mr. vonRosen said.</TEXT></DOC>
