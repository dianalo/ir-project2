Prior knowledge of the geologicmakeup of a coal seam helps improve mine planning and reduce costs andrisk. Long range sensing is required to map roof/floor lithology, seamheight, and mining conditions ahead of mining. Information from longrange sensing can be used to (1) determine if a longwall should minethrough or be moved around a geologically disturbed area, and (2) selectthe proper type of mining equipment (i.e. shearing drum diameter andtype of roof supports) needed for the geologic conditions prevailingin a seam. Short range sensing is required to detect the coal-rock interfacein order to prevent the coal cutting edges from cutting into rock. Thispaper will describe (1) a long range electromagnetic wave tomographymethod (Radio Imaging Method (RIM)) which is used for imaging geologicstructures in coal bearing formations and (2) the use of coal-rock interfacesensors (the Horizon Sensor) in the remote control and automation oflongwall mining equipment.</TEXT></DOC>
