ENEL has devoted, since its foundation,considerable activity to the development of suitable models of generationsystems and of their components, as well as, to the relevant computingprograms which permit the examination of large systems. Particular attentionhas been devoted to the quantitative evaluation of system reliabilityby means of suitable risk indexes (high values of risk indices correspondto low levels of reliability). By assigning a unit cost-of-risk, theoverall risk cost constitutes, with capital cost and operating cost,the factors upon which the system optimization is based. The paper describesthe main characteristics of the two digital models utilized at ENEL forgeneration system planning: the WAT program for generation expansionstudies and the SICIDR CARTER program for operational planning.</TEXT></DOC>
