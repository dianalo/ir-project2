Bartlett Giamatti was moved into federal courtMonday, but it may be sent right back to state court.   Acting on a motion by baseball's lawyers, U.S. District JudgesCarl B. Rubin and Herman J. Weber said the court was accepting thecase because technical requirements had been met, even though therewas substantial doubt the lawsuit should be in federal court.   Because Rose is closely indentified with the Cincinnati Reds andCincinnati, the judges said the case would be moved to federal courtin Columbus, Ohio, where it was assigned to U.S. District Judge JohnD. Holschuh.   Rose attorney Reuven J. Katz said papers would be filed Wednesdaywith Holschuh asking that the case be sent back to state court.   ``We do not believe there is any merit to'' baseball's motion,Katz said. Judge Norbert A. Nadel of the Hamilton County Court ofCommons Pleas issued a temporary restraining order June 25 thatprevented Giamatti from holding a hearing on gambling allegationsagainst the Cincinnati manager. Rose claims that Giamatti hasprejudged the accusations against him.   The restraining order is good for 14 days and Nadel has scheduleda hearing for Thursday on Rose's request for a preliminaryinjunction that would indefinitely put off Giamatti's hearing.Nadel's hearing can take place only if the lawsuit is sent back tostate court.   Baseball appealed the restraining order but a three-judge panelof the 1st Ohio District Court of Appeals ruled that it had noauthority to hear appeals of temporary orders.   Louis L. Hoynes Jr., baseball's lead lawyer, said Monday that anychallenge to the commissioner should be decided in federal court.   ``The commissioner's powers traditionally have been reviwed byfederal court,'' Hoynes said. ``Federal court is a more appropriateforum.''   Katz, however, disagreed.   ``It's not at all unexpected,'' he said. ``It's one of thealternatives that they had.   ``The whole thing now is put on hold,'' Katz continued. ``It wasput on hold by their appeal. Now it's put on hold by their attemptto remove it to federal court.''   Rubin, the chief judge among the three federal judges inCincinnati, is at the center of the dispute. On April 18, Giamattisent a letter to Rubin saying that Ronald Peters, one of Rose'saccusors, ``has been candid, forthright and truthful'' with baseballinvestigators and ``provided critical sworn testimony about Mr. Roseand his associates.''   Rubin, who was to sentence Peters, criticized baseball and saidhe believed Giamatti was conducting a vendetta against Rose. Rubinlater removed himself from Peters' case and that of Thomas P.Gioiosa, another former associate of the Reds' manager.</TEXT></DOC>
