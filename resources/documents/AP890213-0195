WILLIAMS</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Long the butt of jokes as the nation's``federal village,'' Bonn is suffering further indignities and moreribbing this year. Its city fathers doggedly insist that this is its2,000th birthday, and others insist it's not.   ``Bonn is 2000!'' declare banners hanging from every lightstandard flanking the B-9 highway, a flat and colorless corridorthat is the closest thing to a main street in this step-sistercapital destined to be provisional forever.   Local historians concede that Bonn's founding date of 11 B.C. isat bestan educated guess on literary grounds and probably a halfcentury too late if one is talking about when it was settled.   The first written reference to ``Bonna'' was found in Romanchronicles of the Rhineland war campaign carried out by NeroClaudius Drusus Germanicus between 13 B.C. and 9 B.C. Unsure of thepoint when Bonn was founded, historians split the difference andcame up with 11 B.C., says Manfred van Rey, the municipal historian.   ``This is in no way an archeological determination,'' he said inan interview. ``There is clear evidence that a village of Bonnexisted for several decades before the Drusus reference.''   Undaunted by details and determined to host a good party, cityofficials have embarked on an ambitious yearlong spree of concerts,exhibits, renovations and a massive fireworks display donated byChina for the occasion.   The $5.4-million extravaganza, however, has done more tostimulate the local penchant for self-deprecation than any sense ofhistorical importance.   Die Welt, the city's conservative daily newspaper, poked fun atthe historical oversight and questioned the need to lavish publicfunds on the belated observance.   Batches of souvenir mugs, cigarette lighters and other plasticbaubles crowd the check-out counters of newsstands, gathering dustamid public apathy toward memorabilia attesting ``1989 _ I wasthere'' and ``Bonn'' spelled with a red lipstick kiss in place ofthe vowel.   An unassuming hamlet on the Rhine River before its designation 40years ago as seat of the new postwar government in Germany's Westernsector, Bonn has endured decades of ribbing as Europe's Cinderellacapital.   ``It is easy to make fun of Bonn,'' the British ambassador, SirJulian L. Bullard, wrote in a collection of essays about the 2000thor so anniversary. ``No one would award it the prize for BestTheatre, Best Opera, Best Restaurant or Best Newspaper. BestIntentions, perhaps.''   Indeed, Bonn has little fame to claim, aside from being thebirthplace in 1770 of composer Ludwig von Beethoven, who left in histeen-age years.   Bonn has little business aside from the federal government. Alicorice factory, a pipe-organ works and a family-owned venture thatstitches European flags are the city's most prominent industries.   With fewer than 300,000 residents, including the nearby towns ithas swallowed over the past few years, Bonn is too small to rate astore that stays open later than 6:30 p.m. under the government'scomplicated commerce rules.   The small-town atmosphere of Europe's youngest capital has earnedit the nickname ``Bundesdorf,'' or federal village, a play on itsdesignation as Bundeshauptstadt _ federal capital.   It was Bonn's very obscurity that earned it the dubious role ofprovisional capital in 1949 _ a verifiable anniversary that will becelebrated nationwide this spring.   Following four years of Allied control after World War II, theWest German government created in 1949 was intent on eventualreunification with the Soviet-controlled East German sector and didnot want a prominent capital in an established city like Frankfurt,Hamburg or Munich.   A picturesque village just south of Cologne and a favorite summerstopover for the man who was to become the first chancellor, KonradAdenauer, Bonn was tabbed as a sufficiently low-profile spot fromwhich to tide over affairs of state until Berlin, the real capital,could be reclaimed by a unified Germany.   Despite 40 years and all-but-extinguished hopes forreunification, Bonn has failed to take on a capital image.   Reflecting official insistence that life here is temporary,government ministries occupy box-like concrete quarters that couldeasily be converted to private use. Hotel space is scarce.Embassies, though maintained in the tidy Rhineland tradition, tendtoward the austere and outmoded.   More renowned for its dreary weather than its political role,Bonn endures a number of physical oddities that aggravate itssmall-time profile.   The city is shaped something like a Q-Tip, with the universityand a pedestrian shopping area forming the northern puff and acollage of diplomatic missions and housing compounds clustered atthe south.   Spanning the three-mile distance in between are the parallel B-9highway and the railroad tracks, both flanked by a narrow stretch offederal buildings. The arrangement makes it difficult to walk ordrive more than a city block east or west without encountering abarrier.   ``There's something wrong with a capital that has to come to ahalt every six minutes to let the trains roar through,'' joked oneAmerican resident.   Newcomers to Bonn often complain they feel depressed and groggy,a condition some psychologists here have termed the ``RhineSyndrome'' and attributed to unusually low air pressure along theriver.   The spy novelist John LeCarre captured Bonn's incongruous mix ofscandal and boredom in his 1968 book ``A Small Town in Germany,''the tale of international intrigue set at the British Embassy.   ``Sometimes the fog is a little colder. Then we call it winter,''quipped LeCarre's fictional diplomat, Peter de Lisle. ``Sometimesit's warmer, and that's summer. You know what they say about Bonn:either it rains or the level crossings are down.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Feb. 19</NOTE></DOC>
