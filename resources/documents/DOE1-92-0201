Fog was produced by atomizing diluteacid solution into purified air humidified to near 100% by stem injection.Exposures were administered in random order at 1-week intervals, lasted1 h, and included three 10-min periods of moderately heavy exercise.Responses were measured in terms of forced expiratory function, airwayresistance, irritant symptoms, and bronchial reactivity to methacholineaerosol. Sulfuric acid per se showed no more than a slight effect onpulmonary function, even at the highest concentration. Asthmatics experiencedbronchoconstriction, attributable to exercise, under all exposure conditions.Despite the lack of substantial function changes, modest statisticallysignificant increases in respiratory symptoms occurred with increasingacid concentrations. This unusual response pattern suggests that acidfog effects occur via a mechanism somewhat different from those whichgovern responses to irritant gases like SO{sub 2} or O{sub 3}. To theextent these results are relevant to ambient acid fog exposures, theypredict that no pulmonary dysfunction, and only slight respiratory symptomsif any, are likely to occur.</TEXT></DOC>
