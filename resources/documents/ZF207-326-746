Washington St., Denver, Colo.andP;  80233 (303)452-4919.andM;10CAD ENGINEERING DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, ACS Telecom.andP;  The 10CAD EngineeringData Management System (EDMS) offers CAD/CAM file organization andmanagement.andP;  Because the 10CAD EDMS organizes related files by project, userscan access any of the files for a given project by opening up that project.andO;With 10CAD EDMS, projects can be described, retrieved, sorted and searched byseveral descriptors, including client, company, project name, owner ID,description, recent drawing activity, time spent on related drawings andlocation of related records or plans.andM;The EDMS logs each access to each file, recording the designer's name, date,time spent and so on.andP;  For compiling reports from this database, an optionalStructured Query Language free-form report generator is available.andP;  Inaddition, any information from the project database can be exported to Lotus1-2-3 for more in-depth analysis.andM;As with the project database, all drawing information can be extracted withbuilt-in reports or the Structured Query Language free-form report generator.andO;All drawing information can be exported to Lotus 1-2-3 as well.andM;Each file is catalogued, tracked and managed with 10 different descriptions:drawing number, description, contract number, part name/number, drawingstatus, revision level, project leader, department, time spent and revisionnotes.andM;CAD/CAM software compatible with 10CAD EDMS includes AutoCAD, VersaCAD,DataCAD, Anvil 1000, CADKey, Computervision Corp.'s Personal Designer andIntergraph Corp.'s MicroStation.andM;The software runs under DOS on workstations from Apollo, Hewlett-Packard Co.,andO;Intergraph Corp., Prime Computer Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc. and Novell Inc.andM;10CAD Engineering Data Management System starts at $595 per workstation.andM;ACS Telecom can be reached at 25825 Eshelman Ave., Lomita, Calif.andP;  90717(213) 325-3055.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;Bahram Nazmi is the design engineering supervisor at Emerson Quiet KoolCorp., a firm in Woodbridge, N.J., that manufactures air conditioners,dehumidifiers and recreational vehicles.andM;The design engineering team at Emerson began using 10CAD EDMS almost eightmonths ago to help organize more than 500 drawings.andM;The software has solved their housekeeping problems and given the team newideas for greater efficiency.andM;''EDMS allows us to do things we didn't think of doing before,'' said Nazmi.andM;For example, when a drawing file is accessed, a window pops up with notesabout the drawing and information to be added to the file, making vitalinformation available to each user of the system.andM;''It's a very good feature,'' Nazmi said.andP;  ''Other packages we looked atdidn't have that.''andM;CADNET CONTROL MANAGER, CADnet Inc.andP;  CADnet Control Manager, in conjunctionwith CADnet servers, provides five system functions.andM;The Drawing Control Manager (DCM) provides security permission toindividuals, groups or departments with varied levels of access.andP;  The DCMLibrary records how long and by whom files are checked out, and provideslists of projects and drawings.andP;  Descriptions of drawings can be accessed bydate, key words or user-defined fields.andP;  DCM also sends and receives mailacross the network between workstations.andM;Plotnet Control Manager controls and records plotting.andP;  PCM allows users tosubmit files to the plotter queues from the workstation.andP;  Files can be sentto any of the plotters connected to the server without tying up the user'sworkstation.andP;  Users can also examine the plot queue and, with authorization,change a plot's priority.andP;  The queue list available to the user includes dataon queues position, drawing name, drawing owner, plotter destination and plotfile size.andP;  The recorded-history file can be accessed by most word-processor,database and spreadsheet programs.andM;The Project Access Manager (PAM) provides file-access control to CADmanagers.andP;  Managers can restrict access to varied levels.andP;  PAM maintains alog of access attempts, showing all successful and unsuccessful accessattempts.andM;The PAM also provides write-protection to symbol libraries and other standarddrawings to prevent unneeded changes.andP;  This protection enables customers andclients to access the drawing libraries over the phone lines without dangerto the library.andM;The CADnet System Manager allows control over network user access.andP;  Networkusers can be added and deleted from network access with this function.andO;Finally, the Backup Control Manager (BCM) controls and maintains consistencyof backup procedures.andP;  The BCM provides standard backup proceduresautomatically, at a user-specified time, without interruption of networkactivity.andP;  In addition, this function performs non-standard backups through amenu system.andM;The Control Manager software system is compatible with AutoCAD, Intergraph'sMicroStation, Computervision's Personal Designer, CADKey, CADvance, VersaCADand Anvil 1000.andP;  The operating systems are Unix and Xenix, but the productsupports both DOS and Unix workstations.andM;Pricing for the Control Manager starts at $5,000 for eight users on a Xenixplatform and $9,000 for Unix.andP;  Maintenance, phone support and systemconsultation are also available.andM;CADnet Inc. is located at 3240 Stone Valley Road West, Alamo, Calif.andP;  94507(415) 275-0990.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;David Baldwin, principal civil engineer, and the engineering drafting team atthe Water Division of the Tacoma, Wash., Department of Utilities, use CADnetControl Manager to ''address our biggest problem of multiple copies of thesame drawing.'' According to Baldwin, ''CADnet is a product totally designedto provide an electronic, automatic librarian.andP;  Keeping track of who's gotwhich file where -- that functionality alone is wonderful.''andM;The Control Manager software ''makes it easy to organize, in a logical,sensible manner, all of the drawings,'' Baldwin said.andP;  What's more, he andhis team can set up work groups with different levels of access that givesthem greater data security, Baldwin said.andM;DESIGN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, Sherpa Corp.andP;  Sherpa's Design Management System(DMS) provides CAD users with data management as well as process managementacross a wide range of design tools and applications.andP;  This product is acombination of an object-oriented and a commercial relational database andcan also control design documents not in the system.andP;  Sherpa DMS ensuresappropriate design methodology, improves engineering efficiency, reducesredesign effort and shortens development cycles.andP;  This system controls thedesign of various products including integrated circuits, electronic systems,electromechanical products and software.andM;DMS is based on an object-based management system that allows this package tomanage both projects and drawing information.andP;  Sherpa DMS can manage anydesign file and can track application software.andP;  This system encrypts filenames and assigns file names to a protected directory and therefore will notdisturb the contents of design files.andM;Sherpa's DMS allows CAD managers a flexible structure for bringing togetherdata from every level of engineering and design within an organization.andP;  Atthe design level, DMS tracks file revisions and updates user-definedinformation automatically.andP;  In addition, a ''Sherpa Alerts'' functionautomatically marks changes made to design files and notifies all engineerswho are working on related files.andM;Sherpa DMS provides status information to process and project managers withreal-time status reports and ad hoc query facilities.andP;  This system istailored to the particular specifications of individual installations, andits implementation does not require users to alter their procedures.andP;  SherpaDMS also provides file security by preventing unauthorized revisions,tracking design files and automatically updating user lists.andP;  Audit trailskept by DMS help maintain files and provide important resources formanagement as well.andM;With more than 150 commands, DMS provides several functions including filemanagement, configuration management, design-process management, status andhistory reporting, administrative facility and distributed file storage andcontrol.andM;Sherpa DMS' hardware platform is DEC VAXes and runs on VMS operating systems.andO;As a stand-alone package, DMS operates on a single host VAX computer.andP;  In anetworked configuration, DMS functions within a networked or clusteredmixture of VAXes, Sun and Apollo workstations and IBM compatibles.andM;Pricing for Sherpa's QuickStart program starts at $50,000.andP;  The QuickStartprogram includes training, an application template and the DMS software.andM;User evaluations were unavailable for this product.andM;MC*EDM, Stone Mountain Design Inc.andP;  Although it was designed to be used withthe Micro CADAM software from Cadam Inc., MC*EDM allows any user to managedrawings in a self-contained database.andP;  The MC*EDM database can be searchedby any user-defined profile, allowing report generation and data plotting.andM;The software can automatically retrieve data on a specified disk or on alldisks to which the system has access.andP;  In addition, MC*EDM can combine into asingle database any data gathered at different CPUs.andM;MC*EDM contains a separate extraction module that allows for flexibility inupdating the database.andP;  When users extract drawings, MC*EDM automaticallyupdates any drawings that have been modified since they were last extracted.andM;MC*EDM is designed for use on any IBM PC or compatible, as well as networkedworkstations.andP;  DOS 3.2 or higher is required.andP;  MC*EDM is also designed foruse with Micro CADAM Cornerstone or Micro CADAM Plus.andM;The product does not require CADAM Inc.'s Geometry Interface Module and willrun on any CPU, whether or not it can run Micro CADAM.andM;MC*EDM costs $295 per Micro CADAM user.andM;Because MC*EDM was released only recently, user evaluations were unavailable.andM;Stone Mountain Design Inc. can be reached at 925 Main St., Suite 103, StoneMountain, Ga.andP;  30083 (404) 498-6137.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
