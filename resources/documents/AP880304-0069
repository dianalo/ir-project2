Richard Gephardt says a mid-sizedAmerican car costs $48,000 in South Korea because of tariffs _ butthey admit the presidential hopeful is three-quarters right.   An American car that would cost $10,000 in the United Statescosts about $36,000 in South Korea after taxes, tariffs and duties,according to Korean and U.S. officials.   The charges limit foreign car sales in South Korea to a fewhundred each year. Last year, South Korea exported 442,557 vehiclesto the United States that averaged $7,000 in price.   Gephardt has used the $48,000 figure on the campaign trail tounderscore his argument that many nations close their markets toU.S. goods while taking advantage of Washington's free trade policyto flood American markets.   The argument has appealed to some Americans and the Missouricongressman has emerged as a frontrunner in the race for thepresidential nomination of the Democratic Party.   Gephardt's platform has caused resentment in South Korea at atime when the country is under American pressure to open itsmarkets to imports. South Korea's trade surplus with the UnitedStates, its main trading partner, reached $9.5 billion last year.   ``Gephardt is a name on many lips here. But the government isn'ttoo worried since there's still a long way to go in theelections,'' said a U.S. trade official in Seoul who asked not tobe identified.   Korean newspapers and television have provided regular reportson Gephardt since he started singling out South Korea. Gephardt hasbeen attacked by newspapers as an unreasonable politician trying toblame others for America's failure to keep its economy healthy.   ``The charges gave the impression that malicious Korean tradepractices are responsible for the sad state of the U.S. economy.It's really shocking to us,'' said the Kyunghyang Shinmun in a Feb.13 editorial.   But the government has not challenged Gephardt because traderestrictions do exist, officials said.   ``It is true to a certain extent that there exists somediscrimination against imported cars,'' said one offical, who spokeon condition of anonymity.   Korean officials say their country has many economic problemsand is only just emerging as a modern nation. They say the economyis fragile and needs protection, including some import barriers.   The gross national product is below $3,000 per person and theeconomy is weighed down by $35 billion in foreign debt.   Radical students have seized on American trade pressure inrecent weeks in a bid to attract public support. Farmers worriedabout cheap U.S. agricultural products have dumped cow manure atgovernment buildings.   Most Koreans agree that the economy must be protected, but thesmall, scattered protests have attracted little support.   ``The Korean attitude is to wait until it really becomes aproblem,'' a U.S. diplomat said.   The government has pledged to open its markets wider to Americanand other imports as quickly as possible, but U.S. pressure to movemore quickly is rejected as bullying.   ``They're promising changes, but if it's going to happen isanyone's guess,'' said one U.S. business representative based inSeoul, who asked not to be named.   The United States has been pressing South Korea to drop importrestrictions on a wide range of goods. Recent talks have centeredon allowing beef imports and lowering the price of Americancigarettes.   The disparity in the car industry is a good example of theproblems and discrimination faced by American companies, U.S.diplomats said.   ``Our figures show about 10 foreign cars have been sold in SouthKorea so far this year. We don't think any of them were American,''said one, noting that the only levy imposed by the United States onimported Korean cars is customs duty of about 4 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
