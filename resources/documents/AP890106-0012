On Saturday, envoys from more than140 nations will meet in Paris to discuss changes in the 1925 GenevaProtocol prohibiting the use of poison gas and other chemicalweapons.   Here is a list of some gases in the chemical arsenal, drawn from``Chemical Warfare,'' a book by Edward M. Spiers, published byUniversity of Illinois Press:      CHLORINE: Chlorine irritates the nose, throat and lungs andcauses coughing, smarting of the eyes, nausea and vomiting. A 0.1percent concentration causes death within a few minutes.   PHOSGENE: Phosgene is 10 times more toxic than chlorine, butsevere symptoms and death may not occur for several hours afterexposure. Phosgene damages the air sacs of the lungs, causing adeadly accumulation of fluid in the lungs. Victims less severelyaffected may cough bloody sputum for months. Phosgene caused 80percent of the gas fatalities in World War I. A 0.02-0.05 percentconcentration kills in minutes.   MUSTARD: Mustard gas blisters and burns the skin or lungs oncontact. It also attacks the eyes, causing inflammation of the innersurface of the eyelids, and causes hoarse coughing and bleeding fromthe nose. Symptoms are delayed for 2-4 hours unless one is directlyexposed to the liquid. A concentration of one-tenth of a milligramper liter for 10 minutes is fatal.   HYDROCYANIC ACID: Hydrocyanic acid affects the nervous system.Also known as prussic acid, it can be absorbed through the skin andacts rapidly on its victims. Symptoms progress through giddiness,headache, and unconsciousness to convulsions and paralysis of thebrain's respiratory center. A concentration of 2.5 milligrams perliter is fatal.   LEWISITE: Lewisite is absorbed through the skin and lungs, actingas both a blistering-burning agent and a poison because it containsarsenic. Lewisite has effects similar to those of mustard gas, butthe symptoms are more severe and burns appear sooner. Aconcentration of one-tenth of a milligram for 10 minutes is fatal.   ADAMSITE: At low concentrations, adamsite irritates the mucousmembranes of the nose and throat. The lower respiratory tract isaffected by higher concentrations. A concentration of 3 milligramsper liter for 10 minutes is fatal.   SNEEZE AND NAUSEA GAS: This gas causes sneezing, choking,headache, chest pains, and vomiting. Twitching and an unsteady gaitresult from higher concentrations. A concentration of 3 milligramsper liter for 10 minutes is fatal.</TEXT></DOC>
