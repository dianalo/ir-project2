Edward Madigan, R-Ill. No amount of economic theory, orreasoning, or leadership pressure could overcome that, he said.   ``The point is, we can't get whipped into line,'' added Rep.Mickey Edwards, R-Okla. ``The public really spoke out on this.''   Bush, trying to emulate the success of President Reagan, triedto boost the package by going on national television Tuesday nightand asking voters to call their congressmen.   They did - 8 to 1 against the deal in Edwards' office. Otherlawmakers reported similar results.   And in the days leading up to the vote, the White House tacitlyadmitted that a vote for the plan was politically stupid.   House members running for the Senate or for governor were immunefrom the lobbying. ``All of us statewide candidates got a bye,''said Rep. John Rowland, R-Ct., who is running for governor.   All eight GOP House members running for the Senate voted againstthe president and are bragging about it back home. Likewise, theDemocrat and two Republicans running for governor opposed themeasure.   Of 33 members of both parties running in tight re-electionraces, only two voted for the package. In at least one case, anendangered GOP incumbent offered his leaders his vote and they toldhim to vote ``no.''   For the bulk of the House, Bush's pleas for the good of theeconomy, long-term gain, and lower interest rates paled against thecalls of voters staring at gas tax increases and higher Medicarebills.   The voters won, hands down.   The president wasn't the only one who demonstrated a lack ofclout.   Bush enlisted former presidents Reagan, Ford and Nixon in hislobbying campaign, and Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater,ill with cancer, sent a letter.   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., usually can count atleast on the Massachusetts Democrats to support a party position.But that state is practically defining voter anti-incumbentfeelings these days, and all but one of the ten voted against him.   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., persuaded only threeof the other seven Illinois Republicans to go along.   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., couldn'teven squeeze a vote out of his three housemates: Reps. CharlesSchumer, D-N.Y., Marty Russo, D-Ill., and George Miller, D-Calif.   Of the congressional leadership, only Senate Minority Leader BobDole, R-Kan., seemed to carry any weight. With Dole strongly behindit, the entire Kansas delegation voted for the plan despite its $13billion cut in agriculture spending.</TEXT></DOC>
