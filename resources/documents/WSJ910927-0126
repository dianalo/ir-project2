Amid thesticky heat, conversations quickly gravitate to thetriple-whammy that Mexican President Carlos Salinas deGortari has &quot;inflicted&quot; on the petroleum sector: the January1989 blitzkreig arrest of union kingpin Joaquin &quot;La Quina&quot;Hernandez Galicia; the March 1991 closing of Mexico City'sAzcapotzalco refinery; and the recent invitation to TritonInternational, a Houston consulting and engineering firm, todrill in Campeche Sound with U.S. workers.   Among the babble of opinions about these events, theguayabera-clad petroleros share one conclusion, &quot;If La Quinaweren't behind bars, Azcapotzalco would still be producingand the gringos wouldn't be exploiting our petroleum]&quot;</LP><TEXT>   On this point, these members of La Quina's hometown local,the powerful Section One, are correct. The crude,Machiavellian union chief would never have let outsidersshare the influence he and his cronies had over PetroleosMexicanos (Pemex), the state oil monopoly. This was astranglehold that rivaled East Europe's domination byCommunist Party bosses.   Mr. Hernandez Galicia and other STPRM big shots boastedmore than 2,000 Pemex-paid, gun-toting bodyguards to protectthem and intimidate their foes. Meanwhile, union leaderspocketed trillions of pesos: They illegally sold jobs in theindustry and, through letterhead companies, raked in fatcommissions on sweetheart contracts with Pemex for drilling,transport and maintenance.   No wonder that Venezuela matched Mexico's oil output withone quarter of the manpower and that sagging Pemex investmentin the face of surging domestic demand threatened to convertthe country into an oil importer.   All this came to an end when Mr. Salinas dispatched armyunits to arrest the union mafia for arms smuggling and othercrimes. While La Quina contemplates his fate from theReclusorio Norte prison, Mr. Salinas and PemexDirector-General Francisco Rojas have replaced La Quina'steam with more tractable leaders. They have agreed both toeliminate non-bid union contracts with Pemex and to pare thelabor force by 16,000 people -- with another 2,000 pink slipsexpected before year's end. In addition, some 5,429 workerslost their jobs with the closing of the aged, sulfur-belchingAzcapotzalco refinery, a symbol and source of pollution insmog-infested Mexico City.   The anti-union coup also paved the way for the Triton deal-- the first turnkey drilling contract signed with a foreigncompany. Pemex could have drilled the 17,092-foot well. Yetawarding the $18 million project to Triton permits Mr. Rojasto compare the efficiency of Mexican offshore crews with thatof an outside firm.   Earlier this month, Triton completed its work in half thetime (127 days) that the state monopoly takes to drill a wellof similar depth. &quot;Triton has no better technology thanPemex,&quot; Mr. Rojas recently told me. &quot;The key to their successis how they organize their work, and our managers are alreadysuccessfully applying their techniques to Pemex operations.&quot;   Thanks to a $1.3 billion U.S. Export-Import Bank creditguarantee announced last week, U.S. firms will drill andservice 113 new wells in Campeche Sound. A chunk of theseresources will fund other turnkey deals. While the monopolyinvited only prescreened American firms to bid for the jobwon by Triton, the Canadian Ex-Im Bank has provided Pemexwith a $500 million credit guarantee. Thus, a Canadiancompany -- possibly Northridge or Saskoil -- could also landa contract.   Mr. Rojas, strongly aided by Planning Subdirector AdrianLajous Vargas, has also spurred competition within Pemex.They have decentralized into three regions the &quot;PrimaryProduction&quot; division, responsible for exploration anddevelopment. Above all, Messrs. Rojas and Lajous want to send&quot;new signals&quot; to Pemex professionals. &quot;Formerly, engineers,geologists and managers tried to remain anonymous to survivein the hostile union-dominated milieu in Mexico City,&quot;Director-General Rojas says. &quot;Now we want them out in thefield in order to reward initiative, innovation and astutedecision-making.&quot;   Mr. Rojas can now compare operational efficiency betweenzones, as well as between Pemex teams and a growing number ofprivate competitors. Based on these comparisons, structuralreforms have netted Pemex $1 billion in savings since 1987.   Herculean problems continue to plague the cash-starvedstate giant. Pemex needs $19 billion for investment over thenext five years; yet, the monopoly paid $12 billion -- morethan half its income -- in taxes to the national treasurylast year. Overstaffing abounds, even though the number ofworkers has fallen below 150,000, the lowest in years.Primary production, refining and other divisions guard theirturf with the ferocity of a lioness protecting her newborncubs. More Pemex-controlled petrochemicals must be opened upto private investors. Natural gas output has stagnated. Andmany grizzled petroleum engineers disdain the youthful,change-oriented technocrats and their computer models.   In addition, 53 years as a social welfare provider leavesPemex funding a huge health system, as well as sprawlingeducation, housing, recreation and retirement programs.   These social ventures combined with populist sloganeeringabout the 1938 takeover of foreign oil trusts have madePemex, warts and all, a symbol of Mexican identity on a parwith the Virgin of Guadalupe and the red, white and greennational flag. Even the intrepid Mr. Salinas opposes aconstitutional amendment to open Mexico's vast oil depositsto external ownership through risk contracts, directinvestment and other devices.   Still, approval of a North American Free Trade Agreement,now being negotiated, will inevitably expand foreignactivities in Mexico's oil patch. Insiders believe thatPemex, as part of such an accord, would jettison its &quot;buyMexican&quot; approach and step up purchases of oil-fieldequipment in the U.S. and Canada. &quot;If Rojas is serious aboutraising output, we need top-of-the-line spare parts fromHouston, not unpredictable domestic items,&quot; conceded a Pemexmiddle-level manager in Villahermosa.   The free-trade pact would help President Salinas and Mr.Rojas modernize an energy sector that generated $10 billionlast year, 37.3% of foreign-exchange earnings. Moreevolutionary than revolutionary, their initiatives hammeraway at competition, accountability and decentralization. Anunflinching commitment to these market-sensitive conceptsthroughout the 1990s should liberate Pemex from the legacy ofvenality and inefficiency that impedes effectiveparticipation in an ever more competitive world petroleummarket.   ---   Mr. Grayson teaches government at the College of William andamp;Mary.
