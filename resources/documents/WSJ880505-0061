June delivery West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil, declined 17 cents to $17.20, while heating oil for June delivery was off 0.57 cent a gallon to 46.2 cents. Gasoline for June delivery declined 0.56 cent a gallon to 49.72 cents.    The American Petroleum Institute's weekly report, issued after the close of trading Tuesday, showed an increase in gasoline inventories of slightly more than four million barrels, to almost 230 million barrels, in the week ending April 29.    &quot;Traders had expected, with the seasonal pickup in demand under way, that gasoline stocks would decline by about two million barrels,&quot; said William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., New York.    As a result, he said, the gasoline stock figures were sufficiently startling to depress prices of crude as well as petroleum products.    Mr. O'Neill observed that the API figures played a major role in yesterday's market partly because there were few other developments.    &quot;The increasing volatility and sometimes surprising swings in API figures are causing this report to lose some influence on traders,&quot; he said. &quot;More and more they're focusing on OPEC-related and, to a lesser degree, non-OPEC producer-related developments.&quot;    Nauman Barakat, analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. Inc., observed that the market also continued to be hurt by the fallout of the &quot;non-agreement&quot; between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC countries, which he described as a &quot;festering wound that won't go away and which will have to be addressed at the June 8 OPEC meeting in Vienna.&quot;    Mr. Barakat said the pivotal question would be how the non-OPEC nations would approach OPEC members.    &quot;Their proposal to cut exports by 183,000 barrels per day was regarded as too little and even as an insult by the Saudis,&quot; Mr. Barakat said. &quot;They'll have to do much better.&quot;    The analyst said a non-OPEC proposal to cut exports by about 400,000 barrels might get a more respectful hearing. &quot;Another proposal might be that both sides cut by equal amounts, either in production or exports,&quot; he said.    Andrew Lebow, a broker at E.D. andamp; F. Man International Futures Inc., New York, observed that domestic refiners last week produced more gasoline than for any week since July 4.    &quot;Traders are concerned that high production and slow demand, which is lower than for March and for April last year, aren't the typical signs they expect when the industry is heading into its seasonal peak consumption period,&quot; he said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices slipped amid forecasts for weekend rain in the Midwest. Wheat futures prices rose slightly as a two-week-long price slide began to make contracts more attractive to traders. A dearth of reports about new export business had taken the steam out of the wheat market. &quot;It was bottom-feeding,&quot; said Katharina Zimmer, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York. &quot;It's not a turnaround.&quot; Corn futures prices edged up slightly.    COPPER: Futures prices rose for the second consecutive day on carry-over demand from the previous session. July delivery copper rose 1.95 cents a pound to 92.35 cents. Growing demand for copper continued to provide support, analysts said. According to Robert Green, a Darien, Conn.-based metals consultant, brass and wire mill consumption of copper is higher than expected. This was confirmed by the recent reported increase in construction spending, he said. &quot;However,&quot; he added, &quot;this may be the last rally for the market before increased production creates pressure on prices in the second half of the year.&quot; Brass mill use of copper during the first quarter of this year rose 4% from the year-earlier period, the American Bureau of Metal Statistics said. Meanwhile, supplies remain tight. According to the bureau, world stocks of copper at the end of February were 25,000 tons below a year before. This decline tended to offset a 13,000-ton increase in U.S. inventories on March 30 from a year earlier, an analyst said.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Hog futures prices rose amid signs that the slaughter is beginning to fall off from the high levels it usually hits in the early spring. As a result, speculation is growing that hog futures contracts have put their low spring prices behind them. &quot;We expect to see pork production falling dramatically,&quot; said Philip Stanley, a livestock analyst at Thomson McKinnon Securities, Chicago. &quot;Higher prices are coming,&quot; he said. Cattle futures prices closed mixed in the wake of news that talks collapsed between U.S. and Japanese negotiators on a proposal to end Japanese quotas on beef and citrus imports. &quot;Some enthusiasm had been built into the market&quot; over the talks, said Joe Arata, a livestock analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York. </TEXT></DOC>
