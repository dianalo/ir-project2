The 1988 amendments prohibit, with certain exceptions, the importationof such a vehicle unless it is a model that meets specified eligibilitycriteria. The criteria are that the model is determined by this agencyto be substantially similar to one that was originally manufactured forimportation and sale into the United States, and that it is capable ofbeing readily modified to conform to the Federal safety standards. Alternatively,for a model for which there is not a substantially similar vehicle, theagency must determine that the safety features of the model comply or arecapable of being modified to comply with the safety standards. This ruleadopts procedural regulations for petitions and for determinations regardingthe meeting of these criteria.

The Act amends those provisions of theNational Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (``the Vehicle SafetyAct'') that relate to the importation of motor vehicles subject to theFederal motor vehicle safety standards (Section 108(b), 15 U.S.C. 1397(b)).The 1988 Act imposes restrictions upon the eligibility of motor vehiclesfor importation. The principal restriction upon a motor vehicle is thatit cannot be imported at all unless NHTSA determines that the motor vehiclemodel is capable of modification to meet the Federal safety standards.Determinations will be made on NHTSA's own initiative, or upon petitionof any registered importer (see discussion below) or any motor vehiclemanufacturer, and will be subject to public comment. A notice of proposedrulemaking on this subject was published on April 25, 1989 (54 FR 17786).As the agency explained in the notice, and repeats here so that readersmay have an overview of the determination process, a nonconforming vehiclemay be imported under either of the following two scenarios. The firstscenario will involve the making of two determinations by the agency: thatthe nonconforming model is substantially similar to a model of the same``model year'' which was originally manufactured for importation into andsale in the U.S. and was certified as conforming to the Federal safetystandards, and that a vehicle belonging to the model is capable of beingreadily modified to conform fully with the applicable standards.The second scenario will arise if the agency has not made a substantialsimilarity determination regarding a model. In that case, it will stillbe permissible to import a vehicle of that model if the agency determinesthat its safety features comply with the U.S. standards, or are capableof being modified to comply with those standards, ``based on destructivecrash data or such other evidence'' as NHTSA determines is adequate.Under either scenario, a positive determination regarding a model willpermit <T3>any </T3>registered importer to import vehicles of the same model thatare covered by that determination.If the agency makes a negative determination regarding a model's abilityto be modified, the agency will be temporarily prohibited from taking upthe issue again. If the decision was made in response to a petition, the1988 Act prohibits the agency from considering a petition regarding thesame model of vehicle until at least 3 months after that decision. If thenegative determination was made in a proceeding begun at the agency's owninitiative, the agency will not be able to make another determination regardingthe same model of motor vehicle until at least 3 months after the negativeone.NHTSA is attempting in this rulemaking action to formulate a program thatwill ensure that all imported motor vehicles conform to the Federal motorvehicle safety standards without imposing unnecessary burdens on importers.Therefore, NHTSA has tried in this rule to impose only those requirementsthat are mandated by the 1988 Act, with amplifications only where it appearednecessary to implement the safety intent of the statute.There were four substantive comments submitted on the proposal, by Mercedes-Benzof North America, Auburn Motors, Europa International, Inc., and GeorgeZiolo.Section 593.5 Petitions for eligibility determinationsParagraph 593.5 establishes the requirements for submissions of petitionsfor determinations that a motor vehicle not originally manufactured toconform with the Federal motor vehicle safety standards is eligible forimportation into the United States. New section 108(c)(3)(C)(i)(I) of theVehicle Safety Act requires the Administrator to make eligibility determinations``on the petition of any registered importer or any manufacturer''. Underthis Act, a ``manufacturer'' is defined to include any person who importsmotor vehicles for resale. Thus, ``manufacturer'' excludes the individualwho imports a vehicle, through a registered importer, for his or her ownuse. It also excludes the general public and trade associations.The basic procedural requirements for a petition are similar to those theagency specifies for other petitions: That they be in the English language,state the full name and address of the petitioner, be submitted in 3 copiesto the Administrator, state the basis upon which petition is made, andspecify any part of the submission for which confidential treatment isrequested. The petition must be accompanied by a certified check for theamount of the vehicle eligibility petition fee established in accordancewith part 594.Europa International asked that documentation substantiating vehicle alterationsbe withheld from public dockets for proprietary reasons, as its releasewould enable others to modify without compensation to the original registeredimporter. This is a request that must be made by a petitioner when petitioning.In the absence of such a request, confidential treatment will not be affordedby NHTSA. When a request for confidentiality is made, the request is referredto the Office of Chief Counsel for a determination, and the petitionerinformed of such a determination. The agency proposed (and is adopting)paragraph 593.10(b) under which information made available for public inspectiondoes not include information for which confidentiality has been requestedand granted. With specific reference to Europa's comment, NHTSA notes thatparagraph (b) provides that ``to the extent that a petition contains materialrelating to the methodology by which the petitioner intends to achieveconformance with a specific standard, the petitioner may request confidentialtreatment of such material on the grounds that it contains a trade secretor confidential information''.Those who wish to request confidential treatment should be advised thatconsideration of the merits of the petition will be in abeyance until resolutionof confidentiality requests, and that this delay should be taken into considerationin the petitioner's plans. Therefore, petitioners are encouraged to makearguments relating to a vehicle's capability of conformance that minimizediscussion of specific design solutions of a possibly proprietary nature(which are entirely appropriate as support for certificates of conformity).Section 593.6 Basis for petitionParagraph 593.6 details the information to be provided in support of thepetition. In accordance with the proposal, the agency has not specifiedthe number and types of components that must be identified as capable ofmodification in order to demonstrate compliance with each applicable standard(the petitioner must, of course, show that a vehicle is readily modifiable,or capable of modification, as the case may be, so that it will complywith <T3>all </T3>applicable safety standards). Since the Federal motor vehiclesafety standards are performance standards, NHTSA believes that registeredimporters, like original manufacturers, should be free to reach individualdesign solutions. Whether a petitioner's arguments are persuasive willbe reflected in the agency's eventual determination. NHTSA's conclusionswill be explained in a notice of determination published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.Section 593.6(a) Petitions on the basis of substantial similarity.If the basis of the petition is that the model for which a determinationis sought is substantially similar to one that was originally manufacturedfor importation into and sale in the United Sates, and which bore a certificationof compliance affixed by its original manufacturer, the petitioner mustidentify the original manufacturer of the certified vehicle, and the modeland model year of the vehicle to be compared (paragraphs 593.6(a) (1) and(2)), and substantitate that the certified vehicle was in fact certified(paragraph 593.6(a)(3)). It must also submit data, views, and arguments,with respect to each applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standard,that the vehicle is capable of being readily modified to meet that standard(paragraphs 593.6(a) (4) and (5)).The phrases ``substantially similar'' and ``capable of being readily modified''are not defined by the 1988 Act. However, NHTSA begins with the assumptionthat a vehicle that is ``substantially similar'' to one that was originallymanufactured for importation and sale in the United States which bore itsoriginal manufacturer's certification is one whose visual appearance andstructural details are ``substantially similar'' to the certified model.For example, a Renault 21 manufactured in France could be viewed as ``substantiallysimilar'' to the Renualt/Eagle Medallion, manufactured in France and certifiedby Renault for sale in the United States because its exterior sheetmetalappears virtually identical. On the other hand, a Renault 25 manufacturedin France would not be viewed as substantialy similar to the Eagle Premiermanufactured in Canada and certified by Chrysler for sale in the UnitedStates, even though Chrysler purchases the platform and drive train ofthe Premier from Renault. Both its exterior and interior appearance andcomponents differ from that of the Premier. There is no common exteriorsheetmetal, different dash panels and seats are provided, and there isno interchangeability between doors and glazing. Comments were requestedon the degree of interior and exterior similarity of appearance and structuraldetails, and on the extent of parts interchangeability necessary to supporta determination of substantial similarity. Comments were also requestedas to what parts are most critically related to compliance with the standards,particularly those standards which specify dynamic vehicle crash testingor other types of destructive testing.Obviously, if a vehicle already conforms to a safety standard, the questionof modification capability is not reached. To substantiate that no modificationsare required with respect to that standard, a petition may be supportedby a letter from the vehicle's original manufacturer confirming that thevehicle model under consideration was manufactured to comply with the standard.This method of substantiation would be appropriate for petitions basedon substantial similarity as well as for petitions which are not so based.Auburn Motors commented that recognition should be given that vehiclescertified as meeting Canadian standards are virtually identical to U.S.ones, and that they should be exempted from the final rule. It submitteda letter from American Honda stating that in model years 1988 and 1989,cars manufactured for both markets were identical. The agency notes that,at the present time, there is a notable similarity between the U.S. andCanadian motor vehicle safety standards. However, since they are not inall respects similar, it cannot grant Auburn's request. NHTSA does believethat there is a strong basis on which a petitioner could argue that thereis a ``substantial similarity'' of Canadian vehicles compared with U.S.ones. Further, if the Canadian-manufactured Hondas are not certified asmeeting U.S. standards, the manufacturer's letter attesting to identicalitycould serve as the basis for the certificate of conformity that the RegisteredImporter of such vehicle must provide the Administrator. In summary, theagency recognizes that importers of vehicles certified as meeting the Canadianstandards but not the U.S. ones will have a less difficult time of meetingthe criteria of the 1988 Act than importers of vehicles manufactured toconform to European or Asian standards.As for whether a vehicle is ``capable of being readily modified'', NHTSAsproposal suggested, as the first level of decision, that many componentsthat are visible when the vehicle is fully assembled may be consideredcapable of being readily modified when they may be easily replaced withparts intended as replacement for conforming parts on substantialy similarcertified vehicles. For passenger cars, these components would include,but are not limited to, tires (Standard No. 109), rims (Standard No. 110),and wheel covers (Standard No. 211), glazing marking (Standard No. 205),reflecting surfaces (Standard No. 107), controls and displays (StandardNo. 101), and lighting devices (Standard No. 108). Other components, notreadily visible, are also easily replaced with conforming parts. Theseinclude brake hoses (Standard No. 106), and brake fluid (Standard No. 116).In this event, the petitioner could provide in its petition the part numbersof the components that would be subsituted to achieve conformance. In itscomment, Mercedes-Benz observed that these components could be those withthe same part numbers utilized by the original manufacturer during thesame model year and on the same model.However, this first level of decision, based upon replacement of parts,could not determine conformance with vehicle rather than equipment standards.Visual inspection would not indicate whether the steering column wouldneed to be replaced so that the vehicle would comply with Standard No.204, or whether the interior fabrics (other than leather) would meet theflammability resistance required by Standard No. 302, because these testsincorporate destructive demonstration procedures.The second level of decision then rests upon the question of whether themodifications necessary for conformance are ``readily'' achievable. Inthis instance, a petitioner would be expected to submit data showing thatconformance can be achieved without extensive modification, i.e., informationdemonstrating that compliance can be achieved without major structuralmodifications or destructive component testing. A major structural modificationcould mean, for example, strengthening of the rear frame bars in orderto achieve conformance with Standard No. 301. An example of a non-majorstructural modification could be installation of windshield retaining clipsfor conformance with Standard No. 212. On the assumption that a ``substantiallysimilar'' vehicle may be more likely to incorporate structural featuresof vehicles certified by their original manufacturer for sale in the UnitedStates, than vehicles for which there is no U.S. certified model, the Administratormay be more willing to accept data other than crash data to indicate thata vehicle is readily modifiable to achieve conformance. On the other hand,a vehicle would not appear to be capable of being readily modified if majorstructural modifications are required for compliance. Although each petitionfor substantial similarity determinations will be decided on the meritsof the arguments presented, it does not appear that a vehicle without thefollowing conforming components can be readily modified to achieve conformancewith the applicable standards: automatic restraints (Standard No. 208),seat belt anchorages (Standard No. 210), roof structure (Standard No. 216),windshield intrusion (Standard No. 219), and fuel system components (StandardNo. 301).NHTSA requested comments on its assumptions and tentative interpretationsof ``substantially similar'' and ``capable of being readily modified''.In addition, NHTSA was concerned about the possibility that vehicles whichappear ``substantially similar'' to the eye are much less so under theexterior sheetmetal. Therefore, NHTSA also requested comments on the similarityof structural components in such vehicles, such as similarity of dimensionsbehind the dashboard, roof rails, engine compartment, truck space, andother structural areas for vehicles that are visually similar. Further,it requested comments on the degree of similarity in the dynamic crushand crush pulse signature of the imported vehicles in front and rear endimpacts. At the present time, the agency is not fully sure about the degreeof the under-skin similarity of vehicles, and these factors may have tobe taken into account in petitions and determinations. The agency is particularlyconcerned with these issues as they relate to passenger cars manufacturedby Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Jaguar during the past 10 years. On the basisof past experience, NHTSA anticipates that well over 90 percent of vehiclesto be imported under the new requirements will be products of these manufacturers.There was little response to this request. The sole substantive commenteron these points was Mercedes-Benz of North America. Mercedes concurredthat NHTSA had correctly identified the standards for which a substantialsimilarity/readily modifiable test cannot be met. It cautioned againstmaking a determination on arguments alone, citing the fact that a Mercedeswith a European airbag does not meet the requirements of Standard No. 208.Further, it viewed as totally inappropriate NHTSA's request for an analysisof parts by an original equipment manufacturer. It commented that thiswould amount to a checklist for modification, and an admission that allother factors comply. The agency does not agree with the conclusion reachedby Mercedes. In the present absence of any experience with making any determinationsunder the 1988 Act, it does not intend to be restricted as to the sourcesit may consult in making these determinations. Resort to OEM data in thisinstance assists only in a determination that a vehicle is readily capableof being modified to conform, and not an admission by the manufacturerthat the vehicle does in fact conform.Section 593.6(b) Petitions on basis of modification capabillitySimilar considerations apply if a vehicle is not substantially similarto any vehicles that have been or are being certified as complying withthe U.S. Standards and imported into the United States. For such a vehicle,the basis of a petition would be that its safety features comply with,or are capable of being modified to comply with the safety standards towhich it would have been subject at the time of its manufacture had itbeen originally intended for importation into the United States (paragraph593.6(b)). Because there is no substantially similar model certified forsale in the United States, the statute does not specify that determinationsbe made with reference to model years. Cognizant of the fact that foreignvehicles may be produced for a number of years without major changes, theAdministrator could make a determination applicable to vehicles producedwithin a model year, or manufactured during a stated inclusive period.Tentatively choosing a conservative approach, the agency proposed that``capability of modification'' determinations also be petitioned for ona model year basis (paragraph 593.6(b)(1)). With vehicles whose featuresrelevant to conformance capability have not changed with a model year,the agency wishes to state that a petition may request a determinationfor more than one model year if it is accompanied by substantiation.With respect to the alternative basis of petitions, as with ``substantiallysimilar'' vehicles, a determination ``that the vehicle's safety featurescomply'' could be made on the basis of a letter of confirmation from thevehicle's original manufacturer, or through visual inspection where appropriate.However, the 1988 Act assumes that full conformance with the safety standardsmay be more difficult to achieve for a non-similar vehicle than for a vehiclethat is ``substantially similar'' to a certified one, as it states thatNHTSA's determination shall be ``based on destructive test data or suchother evidence as the [Administrator] determines to be adequate''. In thisinstance, it would appear that far more detailed information might be requiredto demonstrate capability of modification with those standards listed atthe end of the prior discussion on substantially similar vehicles. Crashtest data may be preferable to demonstrate that vehicles are capable ofbeing modified to conform with those standards that incorporate barrierimpact demonstration procedures (Standard Nos. 201, 204, 208, 212, 219,and 301). NHTSA contemplates that a registered importer, or a group ofregistered importers, planning to import a large number of a particularmodel might crash test one or more such vehicles in order to generate datato file with a petition. If a petitioner did not wish to conduct a crashtest, then the question would arise as to the ``adequacy'' of alternatemeans of demonstration that the vehicle is capable of being modified toachieve conformance. NHTSA therefore requested specific comments as tothe adequacy of computer simulations, engineering analyses, and mathematicalcalculations as alternative bases of demonstrating compliance with thesix safety standards listed above, as well as others, such as StandardNo. 105 <T3>Hydraulic brake systems.</T3> It called attention to the fact that,in the final rule, with respect to these standards, it may be satisfiedwith nothing less than crash data, or a letter from the vehicle's originalmanufacturer confirming compliance.The agency also requested comments with respect to alternate types of evidencecompliance, and their suitability with respect to each of the other standardswith complex laboratory demonstration procedures. For example, it askedwhether computer simulations or mathematical calculations are acceptableindicators of the performance of components such as door latches and hinges(Standard No. 206) or seat anchorages (Standard No. 207) to withstand certainspecified minimum forces. Neither method would appear to be acceptableas a demonstration of the lack of flammability of interior materials (StandardNo. 302). For demonstrations of compliance with Standard No. 302, it mightbe necessary to submit an analysis or the fabric, or to test fabric actuallyfrom the vehicle, for example. The Administrator would determine the adequacyof the alternative types of evidence.Mercedes-Benz concurred with NHTSA's statements on decisions based on destructivetest data. It advised that computer simulations should be used only ininfrequent circumstances, and recommended that a showing be made by thepetitioner that the intended simulation is considered reliable by the vehicletesting industry, such as recognition through a standard of the SAE orASTM. Once that test has been met, Mercedes further recommended that thepetitioner should show that the variables it intends to use in the simulationare derived from actual data on the specific vehicle that is the subjectof the petition. Otherwise, a petitioner should not be allowed to makeassumptions about data in the absence of backup documentation. If thereis no such data, NHTSA should require full scale dynamic crash testing.As the submission by each petitioner will differ, NHTSA does not deem itadvisable to adopt Mercedes' comments as a regulation, but it will considerthem in evaluations of relevant petitions. The reasons for NHTSA's decisions,of course, will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.George Ziolo commented that NHTSA should allow submission of evidence ofcompliance with foreign standards such as those of the ECE and ISO, manyof which may use U.S.-based standards for their rules. In his view, ``theeffect'' may be the same, even if the wording differs. Submission of foreignstandards, he argues, is especially relevant if NHTSA intends to allow``engineering calculations'' in lieu of crash tests. In response, NHTSAwishes to make it clear that there are no restrictions on the type of datathat a petitioner may submit. A petitioner may support its arguments byshowing similarities between foreign and U.S. standards.NHTSA noted in the proposal that the proposed petition requirements weredrafted in somewhat general terms, so as to afford petitioners flexibilityin presenting arguments and solutions of a performance, rather than ofa design nature. This was in keeping with the performance orientation ofthe Federal motor vehicle safety standards. It further noted the possibilitythat, on the basis of comments, the final rule might be more detailed asto the types of data required to substantiate compliance with each of thesafety standards. After considering these comments, NHTSA has adopted anon-detailed requirement in paragraph 593.6(b), which is virtually identicalto the one proposed.As a general comment, Mercedes-Benz objected to the use of the term ``viewsand arguments'' as a throwback to the old gray market program, and viewedit as an invitation for disputes. This term appears as ``data, views andarguments'' in paragraphs 593.6 (a)(4) and (b)(2). ``Views and arguments''is a necessary complement to ``data'', which invariably will need interpretationand explanation. Because the agency is not requiring a demonstration ofactual conformance, it has concluded that a petitioner's ``views and arguments''are necessary to support its petition for a determination of conformancecapability.The procedural requirements for both types of petitions require identificationof ``models'' and ``model years''. The agency did not find it necessaryto propose a definition of ``model''. It believes that a petitioner willidentify with sufficient clarity the vehicles that it wishes to import,and that comparable U.S. models will have comparable designations. Forexample, Mercedes and BMW use the same series designations for both U.S.and European models, though secondary nomenclature may differ in minorrespects, reflecting variations in the type of engines. No comments werereceived on this point.Section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) allows NHTSA to define ``model year'' by regulation.NHTSA has not heretofore done so with respect to compliance with the Federalmotor vehicle safety standards, because the standards have never appliedby model year, but are effective on a date certain. In recent years, NHTSAhas, with respect to major standards, designated September 1 as the effectivedate of new requirements, although in earlier years, the effective datewas frequently January 1. As an example, the center high-mounted stop lampprovisions of Standard No. 108 were effective for passenger cars manufacturedon or after September 1, 1985. While this substantially correlates to the1986-model year, there was no legal requirement that a 1986 model manufacturedbefore September 1, 1985, be equipped with this feature. Thus, with respectto certain ``model years'', different standards may be in effect. NHTSAdoes not view this as an especially complicating factor. However, fromtime to time, it may have to make determinations with respect to differentperiods within a model year.NHTSA proposed that ``model year'' be defined as either the model yeardesignated by the manufacturer irrespective of the calendar year in whichthe vehicle was actually produced, or, in the absence of the manufacturer'sdesignation, the calendar year that begins on September 1 and ends on August31 of the next calendar year. Mercedes-Benz commented that the model yearshould be that of the original manufacturer which in Europe is often determinedby regulations of individual countries. It suggested that the definitionstate that the designation by the country of origin should control. Otherwise,it said, the agency should use the definition of the California Air ResourcesBoard. After reviewing these comments, the agency has adopted its proposeddefinition, but added a designation by country of origin as an alternativeto the manufacturer's designation to be considered before considerationof the final alternative of designation by the September 1-August 31 calendaryear.Section 593.7 Processing of petitionsIf a petition is filed on the basis that the vehicle is ``substantiallysimilar'' to a certified one, and the Administrator cannot make such adetermination, that does not mean that the petition is automatically denied.In that event, the Agency will inform the petitioner that it cannot makea determination on the basis petitioned for, but is willing to proceedto a consideration on the alternative basis, and make a determination onconformance, or capability of conformance, of the vehicle's safety features,on the basis of such further supporting information as the petitioner maycare to submit (paragraph 593.7(d)).The procedural aspects of eligibility determinations are similar to otheragency regulations regarding petitions and their dispositions (<T3>see, e.g., </T3>49 CFR 555.7 on temporary exemptions from safety standards).Notice of a petition (or agency initiative) will be published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and an opportunity afforded for comment (paragraph593.7(b)). No public hearing, argument, or other formal proceeding willbe held directly on the matter before a determination is made (paragraph593.7(c)). After a decision, the agency will publish a second notice inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>constituting the determination whether the vehicleis eligible or ineligible for importation. If the vehicle is ineligiblefor importation, the notice will contain the earliest date on which theAdministrator is statutorily able to consider the matter anew (paragraph593.7(e)). If the vehicle is eligible for importation, the notice containsthe reasons for the grant (paragraph 593.7(f)).Mercedes-Benz recommended that the burden on the petitioner should be to``clearly establish'' conformance capability under either basis. That companysaid that this approach would increase the accuracy of NHTSA's determinations,and reduce the potential for disagreement over the quality of data neededto establish compliance. This recommendation appears to be based upon therequirement of section 108(c)(3)(C)(ii) which says that ``The Secretaryshall establish by regulation (I) the information required to be providedby the petitioner to clearly show that the vehicle is capable of beingbrought into compliance * * *'' NHTSA agrees with Mercedes that this isa burden to be met by the petitioner. In the final rule, the agency isadding the word ``clearly'' as a modifier of the word ``demonstrate'' relevantto the finding that the Administrator must make (paragraphs 596.7 (e) and(f)).Finally, in order to demonstrate that a vehicle is capable of conformance,the agency is willing to permit a registered importer to import a nonconformingvehicle for modification and demonstration purposes under the appropriateprovision of part 591, paragraph 591.5(j).Section 593.8 Determinations on the agency's initiativeSection 108(c)(3)(C)(i)(I) of the Vehicle Safety Act also provides thatthe agency may make determinations on its own initiative. NHTSA will proceedwith such determinations in a manner similar to those made by petition.A notice requesting public comment will appear in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> specifying the basis upon which the Administratoris considering a determination (paragraph 593.8(a)). No formal proceedingwill be held (paragraph 593.8(b)). A second notice containing the decisionwill be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. There is no administrative reconsideration availablefor a decision of ineligibility (paragraph 593.8(c)).Europa International commented that NHTSA should not make determinationson its own initiative, as it would discourage Registered Importers fromdeveloping their own compliance methods. This comment assumes that NHTSAwill prescribe how each safety standard wil be met if it makes determinationsof eligibility on its own initiative. NHTSA has no intention of dictatingconformance methodology. Its determinations, if any, are likely to be generalconclusions based upon information available to it (which may include confidentialinformation from the original manufacturer), or technical comments regardingindividual components.Section 593.9 Effect of affirmative determinations; listsA notice of grant is sufficient authority for the importation by personsother than the petitioner of any vehicle of the same model specified inthe grant (paragraph 563.9(a)). The reason NHTSA proposed and has adoptedthis requirement is that its determinations cover ``models'' and ``modelyears''. If a vehicle of a certain model and model year is ``capable''of conformance, the determination will cover all vehicles of that modeland model year, and not just a single specific motor vehicle. Europa Internationalcommented that this would eliminate the incentive a petitioner has to spendmoney developing conformance information. This argument confuses a petitioner'sdemonstration of conformance capability with a registered Importer's demonstrationof conformance achieved. There is no requirement that a petitioner submitits conformance methodology in support of a petition for a ``capability''determination on either of the two bases. To the extent that a petitionerdoes, it may request confidentiality, and to the extent that it may begranted, the conformance information is protected.The agency will publish annually in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> a list of vehicles for which determinations havebeen made (paragraph 593.9(b)). This will appear as an Appendix to Part593, so that it may also appear in the Code of Federal Regulations. Theagency intends to publish the first list before September 30, 1990, becausethe CFR publishes NHTSA regulations in revised form as of October 1, ofeach year.Section 593.10 Availability for public inspectionThe agency will make available for public inspection in the agency docketroom all publicly available information relevant to a determination, regardlessof whether that determination is made pursuant to a petition or on theAdministrator's initiative (paragraph 593.10(a)). However, as discussedpreviously, the agency realizes that a petition by a registered importermay contain arguments as to capability of modification that reflect themethodology by which that petitioner intends to achieve conformance, andwhich may qualify as a trade secret or confidential information for whichconfidential treatment may be requested (paragraph 593.10(b)). In thatinstance, the agency may conclude that considerations of confidentialityoutweigh the interests of full disclosure.<ITAG tagnum="84">Impacts</ITAG>NHTSA has considered the impacts of this rulemaking action and has determinedthat it is not major within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 ``FederalRegulation''. It implements Public Law 100-562, under which a motor vehiclenot originally manufactured to conform to the Federal motor vehicle safetystandards may not be imported into the United States unless NHTSA has determinedthat it is capable of being conformed to meet the standards. It is notsignificant under Department of Transportation regulatory policies andprocedures. Nevertheless, a regulatory evaluation analyzing the economicimpacts of this and the related final rules required by P.L. 100-562 hasbeen prepared and is available for review in the docket, as part of theRegulatory Flexibility Analysis. The rule has no substantial impact upona major transportation safety program, nor does it involve any substantialpublic interest or controversy. There is no substantial impact upon stateand local governments.NHTSA has analyzed this rule for purposes of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act. The rule will not have a significant effect upon the environmentbecause it is anticipated that the annual volume of noncomplying motorvehicles imported as a result of eligibility determinations will not varysignificantly from that existing before promulgation of the rule.The agency has also considered the effects of this rule in relation tothe Regulatory Flexibility Act. I certify that this rule will not havea significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities.Although entities that currently modify nonconforming vehicles are smallbusinesses within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, thereis no restriction prohibiting them from applying for registration as importersand continuing their activities. Further, small organizations and governmentaljurisdictions will not be significantly affected as they are not generallyimporters and purchasers of nonconforming motor vehicles. However, a RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis covering all regulations proposed to implement the1988 Act has been prepared and placed in the public docket.The petition procedures in this rule are considered to be information collectionrequirements, as that term is defined by the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) in 5 Part 1320.
