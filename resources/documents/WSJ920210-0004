The chemical concern also disclosed it filed suit againstMartin Marietta Corp., the prime contractor in arocket-engine development program that has proven costly tosubcontractor Hercules.</LP><TEXT>   Net income rose to $34.1 million, or 72 cents a share,from $2.6 million, or six cents a share, a year earlier.Charges related to the sale of a unit, a work-force reductioneffort, and other items trimmed $21.9 million, or 46 cents ashare, from the year-ago quarter.   Sales fell 14% to $709.7 million, Hercules said,reflecting its disposition of certain &quot;nonstrategicbusinesses.&quot;   For the year, net fell to $94.9 million, or $2.01 a share,from $96 million, or $2.04 a share, in 1990. Sales dropped8.5% to $2.93 billion from $3.20 billion.   The latest year included a $42.9 million charge, which cut91 cents from per-share earnings, related to the Aprilexplosion of a Titan IV rocket engine booster while it wasbeing tested. The booster program is considered of vitalimportance to Hercules's aerospace division.   Hercules said it &quot;reluctantly&quot; filed a breach-of-contractsuit against Martin Marietta, prime contractor for the TitanIV. The suit alleges that Martin Marietta failed to providecontract requirements in a &quot;timely manner&quot; and failed toproperly administer a clause in their agreement relating todesign changes.   Hercules said it remains &quot;interested in working toward anegotiated settlement.&quot;   In Bethesda, Md., Martin Marietta said it will defenditself against what it characterized as Hercules's &quot;grosslyexaggerated and meritless allegations.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
