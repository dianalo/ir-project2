The announcement Thursday evening by the office of PresidentDaniel T. arap Moi was seen as another indication of thegovernment's resolve to protect its wildlife from poachers andmismanagement.   Tourists, many of them attracted by the lure of seeingelephants, lions, rhinoceres and other animals in the country's 38national parks, game preserves and sanctuaries, pumped more than$130 million into Kenya last year.   Leakey replaces Perez Olindo, with whom he feuded publicly lastyear along with George Muhoho, the minister for tourism andwildlife. Claiming some government officials were involved inelephant poaching, Leakey accused the pair of paying ``lipservice'' to wildlife conservation.   Muhoho, whose ministry oversees the wildlife department, in turncalled Leakey a ``cheeky white'' and termed his accusations false.But the government later acknowledged that poaching, particularlyof elephants and rhinos, had reached crisis proportions.   In the first half of 1988 alone, 92 elephants were said to havebeen killed for their ivory tusks and Moi ordered police and gamerangers to shoot poachers on sight. The crackdown brought thedeaths of numerous poachers and some law enforcement officers.   In the last year, gunmen also have ambushed and opened fire ontourist vehicles in game parks in southern and central Kenya,wounding several tourists.   The announcement of Leakey's appointment offered no explanationfor the move nor did it say whether Olindo was being given a newgovernment assignment.   Leakey, 45, is director of Kenya's National Museum and hasserved as chairman of the country's Wildlife Society. A nativeKenyan, he is the son of the late Louis and Mary Leakey, themselvesfamed anthropologists.</TEXT></DOC>
