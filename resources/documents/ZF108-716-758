(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Ethernet AdaptersandM;The Ethernet protocol, now almost a decade old, won the loyalty of manynetwork managers and systems integrators with its 10-megabit/sec speed,relatively low cost and widespread vendor support.andM;Ethernet dealt a swift death blow to some well-established companies withproprietary, incompatible networking schemes.andP;  But new companies like 3ComCorp. and Novell Inc. have sprung up to exploit Ethernet techniques for localarea networks.andP;  And big vendors like Digital Equipment Corp. and ATandamp;T Co.andO;have built important components of their networks around the Ethernetarchitecture.andM;Ethernet complies with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineer's802.3 specification, which sets a 10-megabit/sec speed for data transmissionover coaxial cable.andM;Old-style thick coax, about the girth of a garden hose, rapidly is beingsupplanted by thin, pencil-sized coax for easier installation and moreefficient node connections.andP;  Standards also are on the way for transmittingEthernet packets over twisted-pair and fiber-optic cabling.andM;To control traffic flow, an Ethernet follows the Carrier Sense MultipleAccess/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) protocol.andP;  By means of adapter cards ineach networked computer or server, CSMA/CD times the transmission of datapackets so they do not collide and jam the network.andM;The adapter cards act as traffic cops, listening to the network before theyallow their hosts to send data packets.andP;  If the network is clear, themessages can go out.andP;  But it two or more hosts send simultaneously and themessages collide, each adapter immediately sends out jamming signals to tellall nodes to stop transmitting.andM;When the Smoke ClearsandM;When the network is clear agin, any adapter after a randomly determinedperiod of time can give its host an &quot;all clear&quot; signal to send anothermessage.andM;How fast is Ethernet, really?andP;  Although its throughput is advertised as 10megabits/sec, almost no Ethernet actually works that fast.andM;Coaxial cable can handle 10 megabits/sec and more.andP;  But the speed limitreally depends on the number of computers in the network &quot;contending&quot; systemsand as well as thei individual operating systems and the efficiency of thenetwork operating software.andM;These factors together can apply a heavy brake to over-all Ethernet speed,which usually amounts to 2 megabits/sec or less.andM;Not everyone considers top speed crucial.andP;  Agencies planning to build anordinary PC LAN will find any of the Ethernet adapter cards listed in thisBuyers Guide chart adequate.andP;  All have virtually identical functions,especially those with coaxial interfaces.andM;From a hardware standpoint, most of the cards can be configured to operatewith the others, regardless of manufacturer.andP;  That is a big plus, holdingdown the $295 to $795 per-node cost of most Ethernet installations severalhundred dollars below that of token-ring networks.andM;However, agencies working toward higher Ethernet throughput have to considermore factors.andM;Adapter cards generally come with about 8K RAM for buffering, or storing,network data.andP;  Some manufacturers offer 16K RAM, which makes for better datamanagement and less chance of losing data.andP;  Products such as AST ResearchInc.'s AST-Ethernet Adapter can be upgraded to 64K RAM with installable RAMchips.andM;Regardless of the size of a networked computer's data bus, a 16-bit path onthe adapter card will boost data flow to twice that of standard 8-bit adapterpaths.andP;  AST, 3Com, Gateway Communications Inc., IMC NEtworks Corp. and othersmanufacture 16-bit products.andM;If data load on the host computers is an issue, select an adapter card withan 80186 microprocessor.andP;  This is especially important for cards that will gointo network servers.andM;Many adapter cards come with LEDs that show operational status and DIPswitches for easy configuration.andP;  But just because an adapter card ishardware-configurable does not guarantee it will work automatically with allLAN operating software.andM;Tackling TasksandM;Each card in the chart handles its data management tasks slightlydifferently, via customized driver software that links to operating systemssuch as Novell's NetWare, IBM Corp.'s PC LAN, 3Com's 3+Open or MicrosoftCorp.'s LAN Manager.andM;Most driver software will work with NetWare, which has a large installedbase.andP;  Cards like Earth Computer Technologies' Earthnet-Ie or Tiara ComputerSystems Inc.'s LanCard E are virtual clones of Novell's NE1000, soconnections are no problem.andM;3Com's LAN also is widespread, and most adapter driver software from othercompanies will work with it.andP;  But a PC LAN or other setup with a smallinstalled base presents more of a problem for a third-party adapter.andM;An abrupt shift seems to be under way from coaxial cable to twisted-pairEthernet, set in motion by last January's release of the draft IEEE 10BaseTstandard for unshielded twisted-pair wiring.andM;A March survey by the market research company Dataquest Inc. of San Jose,Calif., predicted that more than 78 percent of U.S.andP;  LAN installations willuse twisted-pair wiring by 1993.andP;  That is a dramatic increase over last year,when nearly 90 percent of Ethernet LANs worldwide had either thick or thincoaxial cable.andM;This trend means that new versions of Ethernet adapter cards released aftermid-1990 will need some way of connecting to twisted-pair.andM;Migration to twisted-pair also will affect the bust topology of EthernetLANs.andP;  It will place more importance on central network hubs, orconcentrators.andP;  In a networking sense, these wiring and control centers mightbe considered as Ethernet adapters themselves.andM;The emphasis on hubs under 10BaseT is expected to improve reliability andease of troubleshooting.andM;In a standard Ethernet configuration, the failure of a single node can causethe entire network to fail.andP;  But only the damaged node fails in a startopology managed by a smart network hub, which can isolate a fault in asingle twisted-pair strand.andP;  And it is easier and less-expensive to stringtwisted-pair cabling from a hub than to install either coax or fiber-opticcabling.andM;Manufacturers are rushing to market with 10BaseT-compliant hub systems andEthernet adapters.andM;Serve From HubandM;SynOptics Communications Inc. makes the LattisNet Model 3000 networkconcentrator, which can be configured with its newly released 10BaseT modulesto serve single or multiple LANs from one hub with twisted-pair, coaxial orfiber-optic cables.andP;  PCs equipped with third-party Ethernet adapters also canbe served from a single point.andM;David Systems Inc. is shipping its new 10BaseT-based VolksNet5 12-port huband TP-MAU, which stands for twisted-pair medium attachment unit.andP;  VoksNet5will work with any third-party Ethernet 10BaseT adapter card.andM;Hewlett-Packard Co. has joined the race with its new EtherTwist LAN family,which will replace its existing coaxial-based StarLAN 10 line but willmaintain compatibility with it.andM;ATandamp;T is making similar upgrades to its 2-megabit/sec StarLAN line, whichalready uses twisted-pair wiring.andP;  The company's 10BaseT StarLAN 10 R2 AUIadapter connects PCs, bridges and routers to its Ethernet StarLAN 10 network.andM;Despite the push by vendors to bring out 10BaseT-compliant hub and Ethernetadapter card products, the actual 10BaseT standard is not expected to beratified until later this year.andP;  That means users had better read the fineprint on their purchases, said Howard Anderson, managing director of theYankee Group, a communication consulting firm in Boston.andM;Anderson maintains that nobody yet makes true 10BaseT products.andP;  But hepredicts Ungermann-Bass Inc., SynOptics and Cabletron Systems Inc., will grabthe largest market shares for 10BaseT.andM;Future LANandM;Hubs that can adapt to coaxial, twisted-pair or fiber-optic media undoubtedlyrepresent the future for Ethernet LANs.andP;  However, for multiple Ethernet LANsconnected over wide areas, a fiber-optic backbone ring probably will becomethe architecture of choice.andM;Products based on 100-megabit/secFiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)standards will be able to distribute Ethernet packets instantly over largemetropolitan areas.andM;A newly announced six-port Ethernet connector card installed in a CiscoSystems Inc. AGS+ Router/Bridge chassis will support up to 28 Ethernet LANconnections.andM;That means it literally could connect thousands of Ethernet devices into asingle internet, making the Menlo Park, Calif., company's $12,000 MultiportEthernet Connector (MEC) card the colossus of all Ethernet adapters.andP;  TheMEC, in conjunction with Cisco's FDDI interface card, turns a single FDDIring into the distribution conduit for 28 Ethernets.andM;Based on a custom-designed processor executing 16 million instructions persecond, the MEC card provides a high-speed path from Ethernet to Ethernet, orfrom Ethernet to FDDI, over the AGS+ 533-megabit/sec C-bus.andM;Cisco has claimed the card will raise Ethernet speeds up to 20,000 packetsper second.andM;The fact that Ethernet LANs almost never reach their theoretical10-megabit/sec maximum usually results from network expansion.andP;  More nodes ona LAN lead to greater contention, with packets slowing down to a crawl atpeak times.andM;The common solution is to bridge Ethernet LANs into smaller subsections,reducing the potential for packet collissions.andP;  However, two problems arise.andM;First, although the traffic load on any part of the network may go down,overall data traffic does not.andM;Second, because of the bridges, the ability of one node to communicate withanother is impaired.andM;Kalpana Inc. of Campbell, Calif., has developed a possible solution to theseproblems.andP;  Its EtherSwitch EPS-700 has a proprietary switching matrix toincrease overall LAN throughput by combining circuit switching and packetswitching.andM;The circuit switching portion of the unit transports multiple packetssimultaneously across the EtherSwitch, with multiple switches working inparallel.andP;  Along with fast packet switching, this approach can reduce theneed for Ethernet packet buffers.andP;  Only the destination address has to beread, not the entire packet.andM;This might enable a LAN to reach a throughput of nearly 10 megabits/sec at avery low price -- $4,995 for the two-port unit and $9,995 for the seven-portunit.andP;  Compared with the alternative of multiple bridges on a 100-megabit/secfiber-optic backbone, the EtherSwitch looks like a promising new architectureindeed.andM;J.B.andP;  Miles writes about networking and wide area communications fromBoulder, Colo.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
