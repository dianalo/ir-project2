The study found that at least three factors other than possible insider trading can drive up target company stock prices by nearly 40% of the premium paid in a successful tender offer.    These are speculation about rumored takeovers in the media, acquisition of &quot;foothold positions&quot; in the target company's stock by the bidder, and whether the offer is a friendly one, the study said.    The study by the SEC's chief economist's office began last June, following the agency's widely publicized insider-trading case against former investment banker Dennis B. Levine, said Acting Chief Economist Annette Poulson.    The SEC staff examined data on 172 all-cash tender offers made from 1981 through 1985 to find out if increasing stock prices and surging volume in takeover targets before the announcement of a tender offer pointed to an increase in illegal insider-trading activity.    While information on a stock price increase before a takeover bid is announced can be useful to the SEC's enforcement division, it isn't enough, by itself, to bring an insider-trading case, Ms. Poulson said.    The study attributed about one-third of pre-bid market activity to takeover speculation in the news media. In cases where there was such speculation about a takeover, the target company's stock price increased by 50.3% of the eventual premium paid in the days before the announcement of a bid, the study showed. In contrast, in cases without such media speculation, stock prices rose by 32.7% of the premium, according to the review.    Similarly, the study found that a target company's stock price the day before a bid was disclosed increased as much as 47.7% of the premium offered when the prospective bidder acquired a significant foothold in the company's stock. That compares with a 26.5% increase in cases where the bidder held little or no stock in the target company before making an offer.    Finally, the stock of companies that ended up receiving friendly tender offers tended to rise more in the days before the offer was disclosed than the stock of targets of hostile bids, the study said.    The results indicate an active market for legitimate information about impending takeovers and &quot;suggests that significant pre-bid market activity is consistent with having little illegal insider trading,&quot; the study concluded. The results of the current study are &quot;very similar&quot; to estimates of pre-bid market activity for samples covering 1962 through 1980, the study noted.    Ms. Poulsen, the acting chief economist, said the agency has planned another study to examine the pre-bid market activity in tender offers launched after the SEC brought insider-trading charges against Mr. Levine in May 1986 and against arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky in November 1986. However, she added, a preliminary look at a small sample of bids made after the Levine case didn't indicate any decline in pre-bid market activity. </TEXT></DOC>
