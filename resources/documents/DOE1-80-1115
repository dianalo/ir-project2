This second edition also focuseson advances in technology since publication of the original edition.These include improvements in raw materials and forming and sinteringtechniques, and the major role that oxide ceramics have had in developmentof advanced products and processes. The text is divided into five majorsections: general fundamentals of oxide ceramics, advances in aluminumoxide technology, advances in zirconia technology, and advances in berylliumoxide technology.</TEXT></DOC>
