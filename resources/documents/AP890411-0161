Ben Moore, 43, of Elmhurst, Ill., was taken to the MilwaukeeCounty Medical Complex, where he was treated for cuts to the legand face, said hospital spokeswoman Pam Hansen.   The helicopter went down around 10:25 a.m. next to the U.S.Coast Guard Station on Milwaukee's south side.   A Milwaukee Fire Department dispatcher said the crash occurredas the pilot was trying to remove an air-conditioning unit from thetop of a 25-story condominium.   A homemade videotape showed the helicopter going out of controlsuddenly while lowering the air conditioning unit.   Bill Bruce, an investigator with the National TransportationSafety Board, said he reviewed the videotape and concluded that thehelicopter lost power to the tail rotor. Bruce gave the pilotcredit for avoiding the building once he lost control.   ``He did the best he could with it and brought it down,'' hesaid.   Ray Seaberg, a Coast Guard seaman, said he was watching thehelicopter work when the vehicle's tail rotor hit the building andthe aircraft went into a spin. Seaberg and others helped pull thepilot from the helicopter.   Lt. Keith Cameron of the Coast Guard estimated about 20 gallonsof fuel leaked into the lake, but he said workers had the spillcontained and were cleaning it from the water.</TEXT></DOC>
