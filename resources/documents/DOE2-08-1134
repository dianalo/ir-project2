Monte Carlo particle transport can be performed on a varietyof computers ranging from APOLLOs to VAXs. Some of the hardware and softwaredevelopments, which now permit Monte Carlo methods to be routinely used,are reviewed in this paper. The development of inexpensive, large, fastcomputer memory, coupled with fast central processing units, permitsMonte Carlo calculations to be performed on workstations, minicomputers,and supercomputers. The Monte Carlo renaissance is further aided by innovationsin computer architecture and software development. Advances in vectorizationand parallelization architecture have resulted in the development ofnew algorithms which have greatly reduced processing times. Finally,the renewed interest in Monte Carlo has spawned new variance reductiontechniques which are being implemented in large computer codes. 45 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
