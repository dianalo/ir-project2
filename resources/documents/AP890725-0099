(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two former aides to PTL founder JimBakker were convicted today of evading taxes on $1.2 million theyallegedly took from the TV ministry to spend on luxurycondominiums, jewelry and designer clothes.   James and David Taggart were found guilty of one count each ofconspiracy and four counts of evading taxes. The jury deliberatedfor nearly five hours Monday evening and early today beforereaching the verdict at 11:15 a.m.   U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter set Aug. 25 as atentative sentencing date. Each brother could be sentenced to 25years in prison and face fines of more than $1 million.   Potter released the Taggarts on $50,000 unsecured bond, the samefigure that has been in effect since the two were indicted.Prosecutors had asked that it be raised, but the judge said hewould ``take a risk.''   Both Taggarts sat quietly as the verdict was read. David Taggartlooked at the jurors as they were polled individually. JamesTaggart continued to stare straight ahead.   Prosecutor David Brown said the verdict was ``not about PTL; itwas about David Taggart and James Taggart's obligations to paytheir taxes no matter how much they own and what kind of lifestylethey live.''   ``Greed doesn't pay, no matter how rich you are you've got topay your taxes,'' Brown added.   In closing arguments Monday, the brothers' lawyer had arguedthat they had received more than $1 million in ministry funds withBakker's approval. But prosecutors told jurors to ignore Bakker'srole in the case.   ``This case is about a crime,'' Brown said. ``Did they willfullydefraud the United States?''   The Taggarts were charged with evading more than $525,000 inincome taxes after spending nearly $1.2 million in PTL money onpersonal luxuries such as condominiums, jewelry and designerclothes.   Defense lawyer Ben Cotten had said Bakker, the PTL founder whoresigned amid a sex and money scandal, agreed to give David Taggartaccess to the same resources that he enjoyed. If the federalgovernment was owed taxes, PTL would be required to pay them.   ``The intent was not to beat the IRS out of money. It was tohave PTL shoulder the burden,'' Cotten said in his closingarguments.   But Brown said the Taggarts tried to conceal the money they tookfrom PTL, and he told jurors not to consider the actions of Bakkeror his former top aide, Richard Dortch.   ``This case is not about them,'' Brown said.   Bakker and Dortch are scheduled to go on trial for wire and mailfraud Aug. 28 in Charlotte.   Closing arguments in the Taggart case came on the 12th day ofthe trial.   Before beginning his remarks, Cotten placed items from suchexclusive New York stores as Cartier and Gucci on a bench in frontof the jury. The prosecution said the brothers bought items fromthose stores with funds stolen from the ministry.   ``If what is on trial here is a lifestyle you don't like, thenwe didn't need a trial at all,'' he said as he picked up the items.   Brown, however, told the jury that of the $1.2 million theTaggarts allegedly took, $750,000 was in cash.   ``People don't routinely use hundreds of thousands of dollars incash unless they're trying to conceal something,'' said Brown.</TEXT></DOC>
