A spokeswoman for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Mrs.Thatcher promised a contribution but offered no specific amounts,and Brady told reporters after his 45-minute meeting at 10 DowningStreet that he was pleased by the response.   ``We didn't talk specific amounts, but she was tremendouslysupportive and indicated that the plan we had outlined to her wasone with which she agreed,'' Brady said.   Brady left immediately for Seoul, where he was to hold talkswith South Korean President Roh Tae-woo on Friday before heading toTokyo, the last stop on his four-nation journey, to meet withJapanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.   At a news conference, Brady rejected suggestions that Europeanand Asian leaders might resent being leaned on by the United Statesto put up more money for the Persian Gulf campaign.   ``Quite the contrary, Mrs. Thatcher thought it was exactly theright thing to do,'' Brady said.   Earlier, Brady had said he believed increased assistance wouldbe forthcoming once the allies review the details of the Americanproposal more closely.   But he said his four-day fund-raising marathon may not bearfruit until the allies have a chance to study the U.S. proposalsand their own economic assessment of the situation in more detail.   Brady met with French government officials on Tuesday.   The administration is seeking more than $25 billion in economicassistance to defray the military and economic costs of thecampaign to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said following hisdiscussions with Brady late Tuesday in Paris that the two hadenjoyed a ``very constructive conversation and we will look atthese problems in the near future.''   U.S. officials said the French had told Brady that the questionof increased European economic assistance would be taken up at ameeting of officials of the 12-nation European Community on Friday.   For his part, Brady gave what amounted to a pep talk to theallies, contending that they were close to putting into place thefinal pieces of a three-part strategy to resolve the Mideast crisis.   He said that strategy focused on the trade embargo approved bythe United Nations, the military buildup led by the United Statesand economic assistance to provide ``staying power'' for the firsttwo efforts.   ``There is diplomatic support, there is military support and nowwe have the job of providing economic support,'' Brady said.   Brady's globe-girdling jaunt was one of two administrationefforts to round up economic support. Secretary of State James A.Baker III was scheduled to leave Washington tonight on a similarmission to oil-rich countries of the Middle East, with later stopsplanned in West Germany and Italy.   The administration has a lot riding on its fund drive. It fearsthat without a substantial flow of economic assistance Third Worldnations especially hurt by the loss of trade with Iraq will beginviolating the embargo.   Officials speaking to reporters aboard Brady's plane said acritical need at present was to get commitments for $10 billion ormore to provide assistance to Turkey, Jordan and Egypt, the threecountries suffering the most economically from the Persian Gulfcrisis.   In addition, the Brady mission was discussing allied support tohelp defray the cost of the huge U.S. military buildup.   Japan and West Germany, two economic superpowers who depend onMideast oil, are being looked to along with Saudi Arabia and theexiled government of Kuwait to help provide perhaps $1.1 billion amonth or more to cover such U.S. costs as transportation andhousing for military forces.   The administration also was discussing raising funds to help theemerging democracies of Eastern Europe and other countries such asBrazil and the Philippines cope with higher oil prices.</TEXT></DOC>
