Thomas has the daunting task of streamliningEastman Kodak Co.'s sprawling imaging business. And if hesucceeds, he could emerge as the company's next chiefexecutive.   Mr. Thomas Monday was named president of the newly createdimaging division, which encompasses both electronic andtraditional photography. He says he has &quot;the opportunity tobreak a couple of dishes&quot; when he takes his post Sept. 1.</LP><TEXT>   His chief challenge: casting off ailing electronicsbusinesses that have siphoned off profits. While Mr. Thomas,who currently heads Kodak's health group, says it is tooearly to tell what will go, analysts expect that he will sellthe troubled Atex pre-press systems and Data Tape, a magneticdata recorder business. Once that's done, he must increaseKodak's traditional photography business and thoseelectronics businesses that can make photo-quality images.   Kodak's announcement this week that Mr. Thomas's new groupwould combine the company's former photography andinformation systems units puts the executive in what manyconsider the No. 2 spot. Reporting to him now are twoexecutives who formerly reported directly to Chief ExecutiveKay Whitmore. The 58-year-old Mr. Whitmore hasn't yet named apresident, fueling speculation that Mr. Thomas, 54, could benamed to that post.   Analysts and Kodak watchers say Mr. Thomas is an idealchoice, since he has broader experience than Kodak's othersenior managers. His 30-year tour of duty exposed him to allof the company's core businesses: film chemistry, electronicimaging, life sciences and pharmaceuticals.   And while Mr. Thomas lacks marketing skills, his brasstacks business sense and easy-going nature may be just whathe will need to clean up the mess in Kodak's electronicsbusinesses. &quot;He has a very good business head on hisshoulders,&quot; says Smith Barney analyst Peter J. Enderlin. AddsWertheim Schroder analyst Michael Ellmann: &quot;He's not hung upon his authority or his position.&quot;   As chairman of Sterling Drug -- the pharmaceuticalbusiness Kodak expanded into partly on Mr. Thomas's advice --he was known for rolling up his shirt sleeves, eatingsandwiches at his desk and working from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.While the jury is still out on whether the $5.1 billionSterling acquisition was a good move, analysts give Mr.Thomas high marks for his performance there, and later, asgeneral manager of the health division. Among other things,he sharply improved revenues, partly by expanding thebusiness overseas. He also played a key role in establishinga joint venture between Sterling and Sanofi S.A. of France.   Mr. Thomas's new job, which is part of Kodak's thirdrestructuring in five years, puts him in charge of thecompany's money-losing information systems business, whichmakes copiers, printers and data storage and retrievalsystems. The unit, which First Boston analyst Curt Rohrmanhas dubbed a &quot;problem child,&quot; has been lagging behind thecorporate average on annual revenue of about $4 billion. Theunit had a $61 million loss after a charge in the 1990 fourthquarter, a $1 million profit in the 1991 first quarter and amodest $19 million profit in the second quarter. ChairmanWhitmore said recently that he expects the unit to achieve10% operating margins by 1995.   &quot;Our strategy is to come back and concentrate on thosemarkets where we are presently very strong,&quot; Mr. Thomas says.He plans to focus the electronics business on products thatcan make photo-quality images, such as copiers, Kodak'selectronic camera for journalists and Photo CD, which storesregular photos on compact disks so they can be viewed on TV.   But he will slash research budgets for development of suchproducts as an all-electronic camera for consumers. Kodak hasdeclined to be more specific about what areas of research itwill avoid.   &quot;If we can't establish substantial margins in thesebusinesses, we will get out of them,&quot; Mr. Thomas says.   Analysts say Mr. Thomas's open-mindedness and &quot;just folks&quot;style should allow him to make the necessary changes inKodak's electronics businesses without further loweringmorale there. &quot;He's good at turning around consumer problemareas,&quot; says Prudential Securities analyst B. Alex Henderson.   But some wonder if that same easy-going quality, coupledwith the consensus-style of management demonstrated by Mr.Thomas in the health group, might make it difficult for himto be hard-nosed. &quot;He's not my idea of a tough guy,&quot; saysDean Witter analyst Gene Glazer, who praised Mr. Thomasotherwise. That may not be necessary, Mr. Glazer adds,because &quot;Whitmore is the one who seems to be taking ahard-nosed approach.&quot;   But Mr. Thomas is shrewd. Aside from being a quick studyon even the most esoteric issue, according to Mr. Glazer, heapparently foresaw his promotion: When he moved to New Yorkto become vice chairman of Sterling in 1988, he kept his homein Rochester, where Kodak is based.</TEXT></DOC>
