If President Reagan signs the omnibus trade bill as expected,Toshiba Machine, which makes and sells machine tools, will bebarred from exporting to the United States for three years.   The United States moved to penalize Toshiba Machine for sellingmilling machines to the Soviet Union that could be used to buildquieter submarine propellers.   The sophisticated machines are prohibited from sale to Sovietbloc countries by an international agreement of the Paris-basedCoordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls.   Reagan is expected to sign the bill as early as next week.   Toshiba Machine's wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary, Toshiba MachineCo., America, based in the Chicago suburb of Elk Grove Villege, hassales and maintenence responsibilities in the United States. It has85 employees, 55 of them locally hired, and offices in Los Angeles,New York and Toronto, Canada.   ``We will try to protect the interests of our locally hiredpeple as much as possible,'' said Yamaguchi. ``But eventually, thesales function of the U.S. unit will inevitably be removed becausewe won't be able to sell in the U.S. for three years.''   Exports to the United States accounted for 12.2 percent ofToshiba Machine's sales in fiscal 1987. The company expects a sharpdecline in its exports to the United States for the current fiscalyear, which began in April, but its total sales will likelyincrease because of brisk domestic demand, Yamaguchi said.   The U.S. trade bill also bars Toshiba Machine's parent, theelectronic giant Toshiba Corp., from sales to the U.S. governmentfor three years for poor supervision of its subsidiary.</TEXT></DOC>
