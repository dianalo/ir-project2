Prospectivesregarding photovoltaic conversion are examined, in particular, the supplyof power to isolated areas. Wind energy and biogas are cited as beingable to provide marginal contributions to the national energy supply.The roles of passive and active solar heating and cooling systems areexamined. After noting developments in the area of biomass conversion,the report concludes with an assessment of progress being made by industry,on a national scale, to lower energy requirements and to substitute traditionalenergy sources with less expansive and less environmentally damagingalternatives.</TEXT></DOC>
