The overcharges investigation, headed by the U.S. Attorney's office in Tucson, Ariz., presents a major public relations problem for Unisys because it comes amid heightened congressional and public concern over Defense Department procurement practices.    And, according to law enforcement and defense industry officials, the case could set a precedent for how cooperative Unisys and other large military contractors will be in trying to resolve dozens of other criminal overcharge cases working their way through the Justice Department.    Unisys spokesmen and the U.S. Attorney's office in Tucson declined to comment. But persons familiar with the investigation said prosecutors have told lawyers for the company that they intend to seek criminal charges against a Unisys unit and two of its officials. The charges reportedly involve alleged overcharges going back several years on work on the Army Information Systems Command, based in Fort Huachuca, Ariz. The sources didn't identify the individuals under investigation.    The government contends that the Army may have been overcharged by as much as $10 million, according to one person familiar with the case, although investigators still are calculating the precise amount. Prosecutors and Unisys have been discussing ways to resolve the issue since early this year, according to persons familiar with the matter, and an announcement is expected in the next few weeks.    Any trouble with the defense business would pose problems for Unisys because that accounted for some 25% of the company's $9.71 billion of revenue last year. The problems also could endanger the squeaky-clean image that Unisys has built.    Unisys officials are said to be concerned because the company voluntarily disclosed the problems at Fort Huachuca, provided additional information to the Justice Department as the investigation progressed and pledged to take corrective action to prevent their recurrence.    Now, the company and other large contractors are having second thoughts about continuing such voluntary disclosures in light of the larger bribery and bid-rigging investigation, according to law enforcement and industry officials.    Even if a company cooperates with investigators and pleads guilty to overcharging the Pentagon in a specific case, it doesn't know what additional criminal or civil liability it may face from the more sweeping investigation. So, Justice Department officials said, many defense industry lawyers are advising their clients to forgo or delay settling overcharge cases until the government provides more details about the evidence it has gathered on alleged bribery and influence-peddling by consultants.    Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys is an important focus of the larger investigation because the company had links to a number of the individuals and weapons programs being scrutinized.    As part of that investigation, a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va., has been seeking information about Charles Gardner, a former head of the surveillance and fire-control division of a Unisys unit in Great Neck, N.Y. Mr. Gardner, who retired from Unisys in March but was retained by the company as a consultant, had set up a network of consultants and lobbyists who frequently reported directly to him, according to law enforcement and defense industry officials. Federal agents searched his home and office last month.    His lawyer and a lawyer for Unisys have declined to comment on the matter.    The company has been a darling of Wall Street, in particular, because it has far exceeded the earnings estimates that securities analysts issued when Burroughs Corp. and Sperry Corp. merged to form Unisys in 1986. &quot;I hope {any fine} is just a slap-on-the-hand kind of thing,&quot; said Steve Milunovich, an analyst at First Boston Corp. who has been one of the major bulls on Unisys.    The company also has benefited broadly in the computer industry from the personal reputation of its chairman and chief executive officer, W. Michael Blumenthal, a former Treasury secretary who has been a success at running Bendix Corp., Burroughs and now Unisys.    Despite the image, though, these latest incidents aren't the first time parts of the company have run into problems over defense contracts. Sperry, for instance, agreed in 1984 to pay nearly $850,000 in fines, double damages and interest related to overcharges on an MX missile contract, and there was widespread criticism at the time that Sperry should have been fined much more. Sperry also was one of seven big military contractors criticized in a congressional investigation in 1985 for submitting questionable bills. The congressional auditors said Sperry had charged the government more than $800,000 for costs in connection with its defense on the missile fraud charges.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Unisys shares closed at $35.50, up 25 cents.    ---   Paul B. Carroll in New York contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
