U.S. District Judge Robert Vining said Wednesday he would haveimposed a different sentence on Lemuel M. Stevens had he knownabout the Reagan administration's arms sales.   ``The judge should have all the information he can before hesentences somebody, and in this case, he didn't,'' said Stevens'attorney, Robert Stubbs III. ``He didn't have super-duper importantstuff.''   Vining ruled that Attorney General Edwin Meese's knowledge ofU.S. arms sales to Iran should have been communicated to theassistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted Stevens. He said thegovernment had a duty to disclose information about the scheme tothe defense and the court before sentencing.   Vining said the government's arms sales to Iran ``in no wayaffect the guilt of Stevens,'' who pleaded guilty to conspiring toship military equipment to Iran and Chile in 1984, when he was thepresident of Marietta-based International Services and Logistics.   But the judge wrote, ``This court continues to believe that thegovernment's conduct in selling arms to Iran while prosecuting anindividual for substantially similar conduct (even though suchconduct occurred at an earlier time) is relevant to the sentence tobe imposed ... and should have been disclosed.''   U.S. Attorney Robert Barr said the government disagreed with theruling, but no decision has been made on an appeal.   ``It may make sense for policy and practical reasons toessentially let the matter lie where it is, but we have not reachedthat decision yet,'' Barr said.   ``I'm just grateful for his decision,'' said Stevens, now asalesman of recreational vehicles. Vining released him on his ownrecognizance in June 1987 pending a final order.   Stubbs said he hoped Vining will re-sentence Stevens to the 17months he already has served, four months short of the scheduledrelease date under federal parole guidelines for his originalthree-year sentence.</TEXT></DOC>
