Bassam Abu Sharif, adviser and spokesman for Palestine LiberationOrganization chief Yasser Arafat, said in a telephone interview fromTunisia that U.S. troops would help oversee free elections in anindependent Palestinian state.   Arafat and other PLO officials have often called for thedeployment of U.N. forces in the West Bank and Gaza to supervise anIsraeli withdrawal, provide security for Palestinians and overseeelections in a democratic Palestinian state. Israel has rejectedthat and the concept of trading land for peace.   Abu Sharif made his remarks as the U.S. ambassador in Tunis,Robert H. Pelletreau, met with PLO officials, resuming a dialoguethat began in December.   In Washington, a State Department official said the PLO has notrequested U.S. forces in the Israeli-occupied territories during itstalks with U.S. officials. The State Department official spoke oncondition of anonymity.   The United States recently ended a 13-year ban on dealing withthe PLO and began the dialogue after Arafat renounced terrorism andrecognized Israel, the key U.S. conditions for talking to the PLO.   ``If the multinational forces that are supposed to replace theIsraeli occupation forces are rejected as an idea, the Palestinianswill accept a replacement of the Israeli occupation force byAmerican forces after the complete withdrawal of Israeli soldiers,''Abu Sharif said.   ``The presence of such forces, American or multinational ... willhelp guarantee free elections in Palestine,'' he added.   He also said a proposed international peace conference on theMiddle East could be held under U.S.-Soviet auspices.   The PLO and Arab countries had called for a U.N.-sponsoredconference, attended by the five permanent members of the U.N.Security Council and all parties to the conflict, including Israeland the PLO.   Israel has rejected the idea and still refuses to deal with thePLO, which it considers a terrorist organization.   The five permanent Security Council members are the UnitedStates, the Soviet Union, France, Britain and China.</TEXT></DOC>
