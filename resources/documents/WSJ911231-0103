The McDonnell Douglas Corp. material-support analyst wasamong those who volunteered to participate in evacuationdrills on a new jetliner model being tested in Long Beach,Calif. A toe fracture was the worst that had happened in pastdrills, they were told. But when 410 people surged on commandtoward the exits of the pitch-black MD-11, chaos resulted.Mr. Olson, crashing into a mass of bodies as he slid down theinflatable escape chute, felt his left ankle snap. &quot;I triedto stand up, but I couldn't,&quot; he recalls.</LP><TEXT>   During the now-notorious tests last October, 50 peoplewere hurt, including seven with broken bones and one60-year-old woman who was left paralyzed, perhapspermanently, from the neck down. The experience has shockedaircraft makers into reconsidering the practice of usingpeople in such testing; McDonnell Douglas and Boeing Co. bothare clamoring for government permission to use computersimulations in many of the tests. And Anthony Broderick, incharge of regulation and certification for the FederalAviation Administration, says the agency is also studying theuse of modified, less-dangerous human testing.   But the ill-fated drills do raise questions about whetherany use of employees in product testing -- still fairlycommon among auto makers and some other manufacturers andconsumer-product companies -- makes sense.   &quot;To just bring people off the production line or the salesstaff for product testing is a bad idea,&quot; says MarkRothstein, a University of Houston law professor andspecialist in occupational-health and employment law. Andemployee morale really suffers if there's an accident.Employees &quot;would say things like, `Hey, did you hear aboutHarry? He volunteered for a test, and he's in the hospitalnow.'&quot;   Safety issues aside, critics suggest that asking employeesto raise their hands for product tests implies subtlepressure. &quot;When it comes time for your promotion, workerswill have to believe it will be taken into consideration. Andit probably is,&quot; says Sidney Wolfe, director of thehealth-research group of Public Citizen, a consumer-advocacygroup active in workplace-safety issues. He notes thatpharmaceutical companies were legally prohibited years agofrom using prisoners to test as-yet-unapproved drugs, in partbecause the voluntary nature of the activity was undercut byinmate hopes that they might qualify for early parole.   &quot;It's an unethical practice, and moral companies shouldn'ttolerate it,&quot; says Joseph Kinney, executive director of thenonprofit National Safe Workplace Institute.   And David Stewart, a University of Southern Californiamarketing professor specializing in consumer behavior,believes that in any event workers may be poor testparticipants, in part because of their lack of objectivity.&quot;They aren't typical of how the average consumer mightinteract with the product,&quot; he says. If, say, you're testinga computer keyboard, and &quot;all your employees are wizards onthe things, that may not be representative.&quot;   However, Bruce Lee, Western regional director for theUnited Auto Workers, which opposes McDonnell Douglas's newstance against most employee tests, says: &quot;Using employeesmakes a lot of sense. People who make the products might beable to improve the system they are trying to test.&quot;   A General Motors Corp. spokesman says GM uses employees&quot;all over the place&quot; for human-factors testing, and FordMotor Co.'s human-factors division is responsible for anumber of product changes, a Ford spokesman says. Based onemployee testing of its 1992 Taurus and Mercury Sable models,Ford enlarged their radio push buttons and moved the volumeand station-seek knobs closer to the steering wheel.   It's considered to be &quot;just part of your job,&quot; thespokesman says. &quot;We always figure that you're happy to helpout the company.&quot; In fact, he adds, Ford secretaries areoften asked to drive in cross-country testing, because &quot;youdon't always want the opinion of engineers.&quot;   While some auto-industry testing with employees is rathermundane, contributions to dashboard and seat-belt design canhave positive safety implications.   Chrysler Corp.'s Jeep development team, while leaving thetoughest safety tests to dummies and professional testdrivers, maintains a data base containing names andanatomical descriptions of scores of volunteers who help testvarious Jeep designs.   Several weeks ago, about 50 employees went to Chrysler'sChelsea, Mich., proving ground, an hour from Detroitheadquarters. The test that day: taking Jeep mockups off-roadto see how functional the dash arrangement was in roughdriving conditions. The employee-drivers found some knobs toosmall, and heater and radio controls placed too far away.Earlier, employees at the site had found that off-roadbouncing triggered the Jeep's automatic seat-belt lockingdevice too easily. The design team readjusted it.   Tall and short employees are especially prized fortesting, although Craig Winn, executive engineer for Jeepdevelopment, shrugs off the idea that such individuals mightbe pressured to participate because of physique. &quot;Peoplereally enjoy participating beyond their basic job function,&quot;he says. And employees are drawn by the idea that &quot;someonereally cares where I think the steering wheel should be.&quot;   Neither does the source of their paychecks seem to makevolunteers shy about their concerns, Mr. Winn says. In fact,&quot;we get into some good fights,&quot; he says, when volunteers spewcriticism of a vehicle in front of its designers.   Outside the auto industry, Walt Disney Co. fine-tunestheme-park rides by putting employees on board. &quot;They knowwhat they are looking for,&quot; says a spokeswoman. And toy makerFisher-Price Inc. lets employees' children loose in an EastAurora, N.Y., &quot;play-lab&quot; brimming with prototype toys. Behinda two-way mirror there, a spokesman says, designers watch thekids enjoy their toy creations, ignore them, or worse yet,pick them up and proclaim: &quot;This stinks.&quot;   Similarly, Wilson Sporting Goods Co., River Grove, Ill.,asks employees to help test its prototype tennis rackets,golf clubs, and team-sports equipment on weekends or afterwork. The company's successful &quot;Hammer&quot; tennis racket, whichwent through 30 prototype designs before hitting the marketone year ago, especially benefited from employee testing.&quot;You can tell in a hurry if you have a dog, and not wasteyour time testing it with consumers,&quot; says Frank Garrett,director of racket-sports technology. Wilson is a unit ofAmer Group Ltd., of Finland.   Brown-Forman Corp., Louisville, Ky., gives &quot;points&quot; toemployees who volunteer for tasting panels for liquor andother products -- the points are redeemable at its cafeteriaand at a store where luggage, giftware and china are sold.(Tasting rules require that the liquor products be spit out,not consumed.) &quot;They are employees who come in on their ownfree will,&quot; says David Lundahl, the company's manager ofsensory and statistical research. Top tasters also getmonthly prizes.   Aircraft makers testing evacuation times for their cabinshave used employees in the past to help provide thepopulation cross section that federal regulations require.But those rules may be about to change. California's Divisionof Occupational Safety and Health has ordered McDonnellDouglas not to reschedule the MD-11 drill, at least until itproves that employees won't be hurt.   Self-described &quot;company man&quot; Mr. Olson, who was injured inthe last test, isn't sure whether McDonnell Douglas shoulduse employees or a computer model. But he's sure of onething: &quot;I would never volunteer again.&quot;   ---   Brett Pulley contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
