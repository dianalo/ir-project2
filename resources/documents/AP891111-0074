Although the 40-minute meeting with Constantine Mitsotakisfailed to create a coalition, both leaders agreed a governmentshould emerge from the ongoing consultations.   Mitsotakis said the ``pilotless economy deeply mired inindecision ... needed urgent and immediate attention.''   It was the second meeting within three days between the70-year-old Papandreou, who heads the Panhellenic SocialistMovement, or PASOK, and Mitsotakis, who leads the New Democracyparty. They are attempting to find a way to end the politicalcrisis created Nov. 5 when no party won a majority in parliamentaryelections.   At separate news conferences, both leaders expressed the need toavoid another round of elections. Mitsotakis called for anall-party administration with a short life _ a few months _ andmade up of technocrats. Papandreou said an all-party governmentshould be of long duration.   Papandreou holds a personal grudge against Mitsotakis forsplitting with Papandreou's father, George, when he was premier 25years ago. It was evident from statements by both leaders prior totheir meeting Saturday that they would be unable to find commonground for future cooperation.   The 71-year-old Mitsotakis on Friday gave up a three-daypresidential mandate to form a government after no agreement wasreached with Papandreou and Harilaos Florakis, who leads theCommunist-dominated Coalition of the Left and Progress party.   Papandreou was then given a mandate by President ChristosSartzetakis to try to form a coalition.   The former premier told reporters he will consult Florakis onSunday and propose that the ``progressive, democratic'' forces forma government. But he sounded pessimistic an agreement could bereached on a coalition.   The constitution stipulates that if Papandreou is unable to forma government by Monday, Florakis receives a presidential mandate.If Florakis fails, Sartzetakis as a last resort calls on thepolitical leaders to set aside their differences and form anall-party government.   If this bears no fruit, Greeks will be called to the polls againbefore Christmas.   The deadlock developed when New Democracy won 148 parliamentaryseats, three short of an absolute majority in the 300-seatParliament, in last Sunday's election. PASOK won 128 seats, theCoalition 21, and independents took three places. It was the secondelection within five months. On June 18, a national election alsofailed to produce a winner.   There has been no government to draft a budget for 1990, and theeconomy and the state machinery have been reeling under theuncertainty.   With a cash shortage confronting the public sector, Central BankGovernor Dimitris Chalikias on Thursday ordered commercial banks tostop loans to the private sector until January. Greek businessmendemanded Chalikias' decision be rescinded.</TEXT></DOC>
