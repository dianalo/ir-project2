The study by the National Council of La Raza found widespreadpoverty among Hispanic families led by women, deepening hardshipsfor married-couple families and significant numbers of poor Latinochildren.   ``Hispanics made many gains in the 1980s, politically andsocially, especially in visibility and growth,'' said La Razapresident Raul Yzaguirre. ``But unfortunately, the economic picturefor Hispanics worsened at the same time.''   La Raza, a non-profit Hispanic research and advocacyorganization, said Hispanics were concentrated in low-wage jobs,overrepresented in industries with declining employment and morelikely to lose their jobs through plant closings.   Hispanics also are the most undereducated group in the country,with only 51 percent of Latinos 25 and older completing four yearsof high school or more, compared with 78 percent of non-Hispanics.   The increasing number of Hispanic families led by women is alsoa factor, as those families tend to be poor, the study said. In1980, 21.8 percent of Hispanic families were led by women, but by1988, women-led families accounted for 23.4 percent of Hispanicfamilies.   While 19 percent of Hispanic married-couple families withchildren were poor in 1988, 59 percent of women-led families werepoor, the study said.   Among whites, 6.4 percent of married-couple families were poor,while 38.2 percent of women-led families were living in povertylast year, said the study, which was based on Census Bureau data.   Among blacks, 12.5 percent of married-couple families were poor,while 56.3 percent of women-led families were in poverty.   The study said 12.9 percent of white families were led by womenin 1988, while 43.5 percent of black families were headed by women.   The study found Hispanic married-couple families had medianincomes of $25,769 in 1988, significantly lower than the incomesearned by black married-couple families, $30,424, and of whites,$36,883.   The 1980s were also a period of significant poverty amongchildren, the study said, and Hispanic children were among thehardest hit.   The study found 44.2 percent of black children living in povertylast year, compared with 37.9 percent for Hispanic children and14.6 percent for whites.   The study said the concentration of Hispanics in low-wage,unstable jobs was one of the most significant factors contributingto Latinos' economic disadvantages in the 1980s.   About one-third of all employed Hispanics work in agriculture,mining, manufacturing and private households, while one-fifth ofthe entire workforce is employed in those areas.   The study said evidence also indicates Hispanics haveexperienced significant levels of employment discriminationthroughout the decade.   The Hispanic population has grown from 14.5 million to 20.1million from 1980 to 1989, accounting for 8.2 percent of the totalU.S. population. Hispanics make up 7.6 percent of the U.S.workforce.</TEXT></DOC>
