The rules, which will take effect in about two weeks,expand the authority of U.S. banks to underwrite and tradeequity securities abroad. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Bradyapplauded the changes, saying they will allow U.S. banks &quot;todo things overseas which better place them to compete withforeign banks.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Bankers said the changes will primarily benefit a handfulof large U.S. money center banks that already have extensiveforeign operations, such as Bankers Trust New York Corp.,Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp and J.P. Morgan andamp; Co.   Generally, the revisions to the Fed's Regulation K, whichgoverns international practices by U.S. banks, would allowoverseas units of American banks to underwriteforeign-securities offerings of as much as $60 million or 25%of the parent's so-called tier I capital, whichever is less.The current underwriting limit is $15 million. Banks would beable to underwrite more than one offering at a time as longas each offering was within the limits.   Tier I capital consists of common stock and otherso-called tangible investments that, as part of a bank's networth, provide a cushion against loss. In certain cases, themore liberal rules will allow highly capitalized banks tounderwrite equity offerings larger than $60 million.   The rules also would raise to $30 million or 10% of tier Icapital, whichever is less, the amount of securities thatbanks are permitted to hold in trading accounts abroad. Thecurrent limit is $15 million. Units of U.S. banks operatingabroad also received authority &quot;for competitive reasons&quot; todeal in equities of U.S. corporations.   Other changes would slightly ease current restrictions ona bank's ability to invest in equity securities abroad, relaxcurrent rules governing debt-for-equity swaps that banks haveused to reduce their loans to Third World countries, andincrease the types of activities U.S. bank units can engagein abroad. The new activities include commodity, currency,interest rate and other swaps; underwriting of life insuranceand &quot;other actuarially predictable risks&quot;; and operating as afutures commission broker. In some cases, banks had beenpermitted to engage in such activities on a case-by-casebasis.   The Reserve Board adopted the rules on a 4-1 vote -- twoFed seats are vacant. Wayne Angell voted against theproposal, saying that he worried that the new authority couldbe seen as an expansion of the federal deposit insurancesafety net to cover risky activities abroad.   But board member Edward Kelley contended that the attemptto &quot;enhance the competitiveness of American banks&quot; wasbalanced by adequate attention to their safety and soundness.Under the rules, a bank planning to expand its equityunderwriting and trading activities abroad would have tosubmit to a Fed review of its foreign securities operations.   David Mullins argued that the changes could increase theprofitability of banks operating abroad and thus reduce thechance of bank failures.   The changes were made under the International Banking Act,which requires the Fed to review every five years theregulations governing the operations of U.S. banks abroad.</TEXT></DOC>
