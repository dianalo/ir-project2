(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Network Will Seal Cracks in Child Support EvasionandM;Family Support Administration officials will issue a request for proposalsfor the national Child Support Enforcement Network (CSENET) this month.andM;The wide area network will use FTS 2000 data lines to link existing orplanned systems in the main child support offices of the 50 states, PuertoRico and the Virgin Islands and FSA headquarters in Washington, said RobinRushton, chief of ADP planning and management for the Health and HumanServices agency.andM;Noami B. Marr, associate administrator of FSA's Office of ManagementInformation Systems, said the agency will pay all of the states' costs forinstallation an dimplementation of CSENET.andP;  Once the network is operational,the states will pay for the use of FTS 2000 services, she said.andP;  ATandamp;T Co.andO;provides FTS 20300 services for FSA.andM;The winning CSENET vendor will link a local area network within each stateoffice to FTS 2000.andP;  The links likely will reside on powerful microcomputersor perhaps minicomputers, Rushton said.andP;  FSA is not specifying what type ofhardware the contractor should supply.andM;The 10-year contract should be worht $5 million to $20 million, according tosources close to the procurement.andM;States will use standard transaction formats to request key child supportinformation from other states and to transfer case information, Marr said.andO;FSA expects the responding state to use the same procedures to process theinterstate case that it would use in an intrastate case, she said.andM;Installation of CSENET is a major step toward enforcement of interstate childsupport, Marr said.andP;  In a quarter of all child support cases, the two parentslive in different states.andP;  But in fiscal 1988, interstate child supportcollections accounted for only 7.4 percent of all collections, she said.andM;CSENET follows a demonstration that showed how technology could improve childsupport enforcement across state lines by letting the states share data suchas parent location, paternity certifications, Social Security numbers,addresses, a missing parent's last known employer and any aliases the parentmight be using.andM;Marr emphasixed the project will not create databases, replace the states'systems or be a national parent locator.andM;FSA officials in 1981 began thinking about ways to link the state systems.andO;At that time, Marr said, state systems ran on mainframes with batchprocessing.andM;Using the batch technology, states failed to meet 90 percent of the federalrequirements governing child support enforcement, Marr said.andP;  For example,officials using the systems often did not meet dealines for producingdocuments such as child custody orders that other offices needed to pursueinterstate cases.andM;In 1984, Congress agreed to pay 90 percent of state system costs if thestates met federal requirements for handling interstate support cases.andP;  Since1984 states have upgraded their systems to generate such documents on demand.andM;FSA officials expect to award the CSENET contract by June.andP;  They hope to workout the details on the use of FTS 2000 by July and fully implement CSENET byJanuary 1992, Marr said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
