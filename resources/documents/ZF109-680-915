 TheDayton, Ohio-based company announced Cooperation, which it describes as anenvironment for enterprisewide cooperative computing.andP;  &quot;The major benefit ofCooperation is people automation,&quot; says Jim Walker, general manager of NCR'scooperative computing systems division.andP;  &quot;Cooperation provides functionalityto allow white collar information workers to be more effective.andP;  Theycontinue to use the methods they currently use, such as spreadsheets andmainframe programs, but the s services of Cooperation significantly enhancethe packages that are currently in place.&quot;andM;NCR joins the ranks of IBM, ATandamp;T, Coordination Technology, and others who areattempting to automate the jobs of white collar workers.andP;  While spreadsheets,word processors, and databases automated many clerical jobs, automatingmanagerial or informational jobs is much more difficult.andP;  The softwareenvironments needed are quite complex and must integrate a suite of officeautomation software, communications software, such as electronic mail andremote access applications, and communications services, such as gateways toremote hosts and networks, plus they must be able to access informationresiding on a myriad of computer platforms.andM;Cooperation is the first product in NCR's open cooperative computingarchitecture, a client-server model that employs object-oriented technologyand support for open, rather than proprietary, systems.andM;Cooperation's 54 modules integrate users, applications, information, andnetworks.andP;  Information access services give users access to other computersystems, ranging from departmental systems to mainframes.andP;  User servicesprovide a consistent, easy-to-use interface and business tools to improveuser productivity and effectiveness.andP;  Application services allow developersto integrate existing applications.andP;  Network services provide local and widearea network options.andM;With Cooperation, a user opens a &quot;desk-top&quot; or series of applications andtheir underlying communications services.andP;  After the work is completed, theuser can then close the desktop, reduce it to an icon, name it, file it in afolder, and at some later time open it; the desktop will exist exactly as itwas when it was saved.andP;  A desktop icon can be sent to other workers, whoreceive an exact copy of the first worker's desktop, files, messages, andall.andM;To achieve Cooperation, &quot;NCR acquired the best technology in each class,&quot;according to Walker.andP;  Developing proprietary applications and communicationssystems &quot;would go against the grain of providing a totally open environment,&quot;he continues.andP;  NCR combined many third-party products, including Microsoft'sLAN Manager 2.0 network operating system, ATandamp;T's LAN Manager/Unix, Saros'FileShare document engine, Gupta Technology's SQLBase and SQLGateway databaseserver and gateway, Eicon Technology's communication gateways, and ChannelComputing's Forest andamp; Trees SQL-based executive information system.andM;But NCR did more than simply cobble together networking products andapplications.andP;  It orchestrated the various components, plus added consistentinstallation facilities, software distribution services, directory services,communications capabilities, and backup, restore, and recovery functions.andM;Cooperations's information access services connect users to multivendorsystems, enabling them to access applications, files, and databases through aremote applications access facility, a communications authoring tool, anddatabase access.andP;  The remote applications facility enables users to accessapplications residing on remote hosts or networks.andP;  Workers employ thecommunications authoring tool to generate scripts to log on to remoteapplications and access files.andP;  The database access module provides access toSQL relational databases, including Oracle and SQLBase.andM;The user services consist of an object-oriented graphical user interface,information storage manager, compound document editor, business informationmonitor, and workflow and task automation software.andM;The graphical user interface is NCR Desktop, which is rooted inHewlett-Packard's NewWave.andP;  Icons are used to represent objects, which may bedata and its associated application or tools such as files or printers.andO;NCR's enhancements enable an entire desktop to be serialized, or translatedinto the NewWave format, and transferred to other clients, which NewWavecannot do, according to Walker.andM;A compound document editor lets users integrate text, graphics, data, andimages from multiple sources into a single document.andP;  The information storagemanager is a management and retrieval system that provides documentcataloging services.andP;  Because files can be retrieved according to a set ofattributes, such as author or key word, users don't have to remember detailssuch as the DOS file name.andM;The business information monitor tracks and reports the status of criticalbusiness success factors.andP;  This executive information system can retrieveinformation from nearly any SQL database and post up-to-the-second changes.andM;Procedures can be documented and automated through the workflow automationmodule.andP;  In Cooperation, each participant is given a role, the roles areassigned attributes, and locations for each are determined.andP;  The flow of workamong the roles, attributes, and locations is then defined.andP;  The workflowautomation monitors the tasks that must be accomplished.andP;  The task automationmanager records users' keystrokes to automate repetitive tasks such aslogging onto a mainframe database and retrieving certain files.andM;Cooperation also provides electronic mail and fax services.andP;  Non-Cooperatione-mail packages may be accessed through the X.400 messaging standard or aSoftSwitch e-mail gateway.andP;  A fax gateway gives users the option of faxing ore-mailing their messages.andM;A much-overlooked feature of cooperative software packages is management.andO;With such sophisticated communication taking place, keeping data secure fromusers and hardware failures and keeping the software up-to-date is mostchallenging.andP;  NCR provides several system management functions, includingcentralized software distribution, configuration management, securitymanagement, and file backup and restoration.andP;  Administrators may use theconfiguration management module to define workgroup and user profiles andallocate applications and functions to certain client or server machines.andO;The security facility establishes access to system elements such as servers,files, and applications.andP;  Backup and restoration functions automatically backup clients to servers.andP;  Servers are automatically backed up to other servers,allowing for a degree of fault tolerance.andP;  Backup and restoration is evenmore critical in a distributed computing environment than in a traditionalnetwork.andM;Non-Cooperation applications can be integrated into the NCR environment andnew Cooperation applications may be developed using NCR's tools.andO;Object-oriented programming allows software developers to reuse large modulesof code, the company claims.andM;Cooperation runs on any Intel 286, 386, or 486 PC, running DOS and Windows3.0 at the client and any Micro Channel file server running OS/2 StandardEdition or Unix V.4.andP;  The second release, due in 1991, will support OS/2 andUnix clients.andP;  Cooperation requires Ethernet or Token Ring hardware.andP;  Widearea network gateways are provided for OSI, IBM SNA, and X.25 packet-switchednetworks.andM;Early customer installation of Cooperation has begun, and generalavailability is scheduled for March 1991.andP;  Early customer installation forthe Unix servers supporting DOS clients is slated for June 1991, with generalavailability in August 1991.andM;Cooperation's modules can be purchased separately or in packages.andP;  Pricingranges from $23,000 to $37,000 for a 12-user configuration which is a peruser cost of $1,900 to $3,100.andP;  Pricing for a 24-user configuration is$40,000 to $58,000.andP;  Per user costs range from $1,700 to $2,500.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
