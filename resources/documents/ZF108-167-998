DELUGED WITH PAPERandM;For decades, new technologies have evolved in the computer industry andchanged the way large and small companies operate.andP;  In general, eachtechnology was nurtured in a department or a type of business and filled adistinct niche.andM;Currently, businesses are undertaking an ambitious task that will impactevery aspect of their operations.andP;  Corporations no longer are examining newtechnology case by case.andP;  Instead, they are searching for common threads totie all technologies into homogeneous wholes.andP;  Businesses are buildinginfrastructures so information can be quickly and easily moved throughout anenterprise.andM;In a competitive business environment, the ability to move up-to-dateinformation may literally be the difference between the life or death of acompany.andP;  For decades, industry pundits have painted a picture of thepaperless office, with all company records stored electronically rather thanin steel file cabinets.andM;Yet, companies continue to generate an enormous amount of paper documents.andP;  Anumber of technologies are emerging or converging that should slow the paperpush.andP;  While a panacea still remains far away, many companies aresuccessfully using various technologies to automate much of their operations.andM;Word processing was one of the first technologies that directly attacked thepaper problem.andP;  Led by Wang Laboratories Corp. in Lowell, Mass., the computerindustry delivered a series of tools that let companies electronicallygenerate, change and store memos.andP;  Mounds of paper stored in file cabinetswere quickly transformed into stacks of computer diskettes.andM;As companies generated electronic documents, they needed mechanisms to movememos from one department to a second.andP;  Electronic mail filled this void.andM;As the number of electronic memos increased, corporations needed tools toarchive documents.andP;  Text informatiopn management systems emerged and letusers search for and select specific documents.andM;In many companies, memos were printed and shipped to a printing department,where the information was entered into a typesetting machine, which producedpresentation quality materials.andP;  This process was inefficient becauseinformation was keyed in twice.andM;The Macintosh from Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, Calif., has been creditedwith keeping information in an electronic form.andP;  Memos generated on aMacintosh word processing system can be moved to a desktop publishing systemand printed on a presentation quality output device, such as a laser printer,or even a typesetter.andM;As the use of desktop publishing software grew, limitations with textdocument systems became apparent.andP;  Users who worked with photographs, imagesand graphic information could not easily incorporate them in their textsystems.andP;  Separate imaging systems, which captured and reproduced thisinformation, filled this void.andM;Images and graphic information require a great deal of storage, socorporations needed an inexpensive way to house the information.andP;  Opticaldisks, which include Write Once Read Many (Worm) and Compact Disk-Read OnlyMemory (CD-ROM), helped to solve that problem.andP;  A 26-volume encyclopedia setcan be housed on one side of a disk.andM;With more information being stored electronically, corporations needed helpentering information.andP;  John Chartier, the print manager at The HartfordInsurance Group in Bloomfield, Conn., said that keying in informationrepresented the insurance company's most significant challenge.andP;  Scannersbecame more sophisticated and aided in solving that problem.andM;The rapid rise in these technologies has blurred their dividing lines.andO;Michael Muth, the product marketing manager at Infodata Systems Inc. in FallsChurch, Va., explained, &quot;Users are no longer content to work with only textdocuments.andP;  They want to scan a document, add graphics and images to it,store it on an optical disk, and send it to a desktop publishing system.&quot;andM;Vendors are gradually meeting these demands.andP;  For example, IBM's Displaywriteword processing package can work with information generated on electronicpublishing systems.andP;  Inquire/Text, a text management system from InfodataSystems, has been enhanced to work with various image processing systems.andM;The melding of these technologies underlines a fundamental shift in howcorporations conduct their businesses.andP;  &quot;Changes in the industry are notsimply product or system evolution but cultural upheavals,&quot; said JosephFischer, a senior vice president at the Arlington, Va., office of Arthur D.andO;Little.andP;  &quot;Companies are literally pushing vendors to deliver products thateliminate paper.&quot;andM;Surprisingly, the most ambitious effort is evident in the federal governmentand not in the commercial sector.andP;  &quot;One does not expect the government to bean automation leader,&quot; noted T. Capers Jones, chairman of SoftwareProductivity Research Inc., a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass.andM;In September 1985, the U.S.andP;  Department of Defense (DOD) undertook anambitious project dubbed Computer-aided Logistics Support (Cals).andP;  Theproject's goal is to replace paper documents with electronic media and buildcomputer networks so employees can easily access that information.andM;The project's goal is ambitious, yet it has garnered the support of top-levelDOD officials.andP;  The reason is that the DOD was drowning in a sea of paper.andO;Sophisticated weapons generate an enormous amount of documentation and haveextremely long life cycles.andP;  For example, the maintenance of a tank, whichmay last for 40 years, involves thousands of pages found in many manuals.andM;This information has to be stored in a central location and organized sotechnicians can find it.andP;  The DOD is responsible for 240 million engineeringdrawings and 15 million technical manuals.andP;  As one would imagine, documentsare stored in a variety of places and often are difficult to access.andM;The cost of generating and maintaining documentation has risen to 10% of thetotal cost for sophisticated weapons, according to Hartford Boykin, a seniorconsultant with Daniel Appleton Co., a Los Angeles consulting firm.andP;  Withsophisticated systems, that cost represents hundreds of millions of dollars.andM;Cals was designed to cut costs by establishing standards to connectcomputers, store graphic information, design software applications, and inputdata.andM;The project is expected to dramatically change the DOD's entire operation.andO;Bills will be generated and paid with computer tapes.andP;  Internal memos will bestored on electronic mail systems.andP;  Eventually, documentation for maintaininga defense system, for example, a submarine missile system, will be placed oncomputer diskettes.andM;The DOD works with various brands of computers, so standards were needed soinformation could be shipped department to department.andP;  The DOD is workingwith standards bodies to outline needed standards.andM;Graphics standards is one area where the government is moving quickly.andP;  Mostspecifications for complex defense systems are designed on computer-aideddesign/computer-aided manufacturing systems.andP;  The DOD Cals effort isoutlining standards so the CAD/CAM information can be stored on distributedsystems.andM;VENDOR, SUPPLIER ESSENTIALandM;For Cals to succeed, the DOD needed not only internal commitment but alsohelp from suppliers, who had to ship their technical informationelectronically.andM;To prod its vendors, the DOD mandated in Octobr 1988 that all new weaponssystem proposals must be sent on magnetic tape.andP;  The deadline for complianceis August.andP;  The agency has vowed to stop doing business with contractors thatrefuse to support Cals.andM;The DOD is four years into the first phase of the project, which has a10-year schedule.andP;  A number of vendors have announced Cals-compliantproducts.andP;  &quot;If you want to sell your products to the government, you mustsupport Cals,&quot; said Muth at Infodata Systems.andM;Currently, 100 companies, which include computer vendors, software companiesand defense agency contractors, have voiced support for the project.andP;  Defenseagency contractors include many of the nation's leading MIS departments, suchas McDonnell Douglas Corp., Lockheed Corp. and Grumman Co. Attendance at aCalspecific conference has risen from hundreds in 1986 to thousands in 1989.andM;The Cals initiative is slowly moving from interesting concept to demonstrableprocess.andP;  Approximately 20 companies have begun testing their Cals productson a DOD network, dubbed Cals Test Net.andP;  At two trade shows, vendors haveconnected their Cals to other suppliers' wares.andM;A few DOD agencies recently undertook pilot programs.andP;  In June 1989, the U.S.andO;Navy awarded to Advanced Technology Inc. In Reston, Va., a $154 million,10-year contract to build a comprehensive Cals-compliant system.andM;Last August, the U.S.andP;  Army signed a $ 16 million contract for a pilot Calsproject with Xerox Corp., Stamford, Conn., and Computer Sciences Corp.,andO;Garden Grove, Calif.andM;Analysts agree that the Cals initiative will spill into the commercialmarket.andP;  &quot;Businesses are dealing with the same issues that the governmentfaces,&quot; said Carl Machover, president of Machover Associates, a White Plains,N.Y., consulting firm.andP;  &quot;The DOD is outlining a complete set of standards.andO;Commercial enterprises are looking at the standards and saying, 'Why reinventthe wheel?andP;  We will follow the DOD's lead.'&quot;andM;Maintaining documentation is a problem for companies that make sophisticatedcommercial products, like automobiles and airplanes.andP;  Analysts reported thatdocumentation generated for a plane like a Boeing 747 weighs about as much asthe plane itself.andM;Setting up procedures to provide easy access to documentation is difficult.andO;&quot;At some companies, employees find labels stamped 'Warning' and do not knowwhich design boards they came from,&quot; explained Kevin Cavanaugh, director ofmarketing at Xyvision Inc., a Wakefield, Mass., manufacturer of desktoppublishing systems.andP;  &quot;These companies need tools to automate the designprocess.&quot;andM;Faced with such problems, companies like Boeing Corp., Seattle, and GeneralMotors Corp., Detroit, became active in many standards bodies and are leadingthe push to new technologies, such as the Open System Interconnection networkmodel.andM;While the value of a paperless office is clear, observers agree that a numberof issues need to be addressed.andP;  Standards are high on the list; many areonly in the nascent stage.andP;  For example, conformance tests on the Cals TestNEt convinced the DOD to tweak a handful of its graphics standards.andM;Corporations also face practical problems.andP;  Chartier at the Hartford Co. saidthat sending information between different computers is still cumbersome.andO;&quot;Moving information between applications is neither seamless nor painless,&quot;he said.andM;Cost remains a stumbling block.andP;  Many technologies have not reached the pointwhere they are cost effective.andP;  Traditionally, the cost of generating andstoring paper has been one-fifth the cost of electronic alternatives.andM;The cost ratio is changing as electronic media prices plumment, but expertsagree that paper will continue to hold the edge for the next few years.andM;A number of first are beginning to look beyond hard costs and evaluate thehidden savings that electronic media offers.andP;  &quot;The economics of costjustification are changing,&quot; said Muth of Infodata Systems.andP;  &quot;Previously,companies simply looked at bottom-line expenses.andP;  Now, many view new systemsnot as simple cost cutters but as platforms for gaining competitiveadvantages.&quot;andM;This push is coming from leading edge companies.andP;  &quot;Technologies are mergingso computer systems are now used with mission-critical information,&quot;Cavanaugh stated.andP;  &quot;With this change, companies are actively searching fornew ways to exploit their systems.&quot;andM;The issue of competitive advantage is present in large and small companies.andO;Vendors report that they can no longer talk to potential customers withoutillustrating now their products can be used for competitive advantage.andM;Muth belongs to the Society for Competitive Intelligence Professionals, basedin Washington, which examines how information systems can be used forcompetitive advantage.andP;  Membership in the three-year-old organization hasswelled from 300 to 1,000.andM;DESIGNING ELECTRONICALLYandM;Many companies search through important records that are storedelectronically.andP;  A few years ago, Cetus, an Emeryville, Calif., biotechnologycompany, installed Basisplus, a text information management system fromInformation Dimensions Inc., Dublin, Ohio.andM;Acceptance of the system was slow at first, according to Pam Handman, managerof information systems at Cetus, but the company now supports 15 textmanagement-based applications.andP;  At Cetus, new applications are often notsubject to strict cost justification processes.andP;  For example, the companyinstalled a database management system with information about competitors'products.andP;  &quot;Management saw the value of that application and simply approvedit,&quot; Handman noted.andM;At Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass., the design of a new VAX systemwas completed electronically.andP;  Teams of engineers in Europe, the U.S.andP;  andAustralia developed the computer system specifications by passing informationover the company's internal network.andM;Because the teams were located in different time zones, work on the projectwas literally completed around the clock.andP;  The company estimated thatdelivery time for the system was cut from 24 to 15 months.andM;Last year, American Express Co. in Phoenix, Ariz., added imaging technologyit its billing system.andP;  Card members' monthly statements now includecompleted credit slips.andP;  American Express said that the system has cut downon the number of customer inquiries and complaints.andM;Companies like American Express, Cetus and DEC have merged varioustechnologies to improve their efficiency.andP;  While the work is laudable, itrepresents only a first step in the evolution of the paperless office.andM;Many companies generate documents which are sent to suppliers and customers.andO;Increasingly, corporations are opening up their computer systems to theirpartners so documents can be exchanged electronically.andP;  Like the DOD, thegoal is to automate entire operations.andM;Reaching this goal still requires substantial work.andP;  Observers agree that thepaperless office will evolve in a manner similar to electronic datainterchange, a method for moving invoices between trading partners.andP;  This20-year-old technology gained widespread acceptance only during the past newyears.andM;Jones at Software Productivity Research said, &quot;We are making progress intackling the paper problem.andP;  But we still have a way to go before we cleanout everyone's 'In' basket.&quot;andM;Korzeniowski is a freelance writer based in Malden, Mass.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
