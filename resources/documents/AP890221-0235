Evening television movies areinterrupted with all kinds of invitations, sometimes attractiveyoung women, purring, ``There's a party on your line whenever youwant. Call as often as you want.''   Businesses that deal in sex have never been known for truth inadvertising, but the expansion and invasion of the informationtelephone services, sanctioned by state and local authorities, isbecoming troublesome to many.   In California, the state legislature and the Public ServiceCommission made it mandatory for the telephone company to blocklines to such calls at the customer's request. Pacific Bell has asuit pending against a dozen dial-a-porn operators to force them tocease and desist on the basis that they are damaging Pacific Bell'sreputation.   New York Telephone says it makes an effort to survey the talklines and operators are required to provide monitors who can cut offdisruptive or obscene callers. While this works on some lines, itdoesn't seem to work on others.   New York Telephone will now block dial-it calls from residencesfor free. Until this January, there was a $5 charge. Businesses mustpay $10 and up, depending on the number of lines.   The company will also cancel the charges the first time, if thecustomer complains that a child or teen-ager made the calls withoutparental permission. After that, the customer is urged to have theline blocked, or keep their youngsters off the phone.   The phone company loses nothing. It gets half the charge whetherthe dial-it service collects or not. One West Coast company saysuncollected calls cost it $400,000 a year.   Southern Bell shut down dial-a-porn services in Miami and Atlantain 1984 and so far has been upheld by the courts.   The option of blocking calls apparently did not reach VilmaLantiqua, a 49-year-old mother of a 17-year-old high school dropoutin New York City. Her son, Sergio, had run up a $1,400 phone bill,calling various party lines. In desperation she put the phone in herdaughter's padlocked bedroom. So one night in January, Sergio brokeinto his mother's bedroom, stuffed a sock in her mouth and strangledher, police said.   The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case this spring inwhich a California dial-a-porn operator, Sable Communications in theLos Angeles area, is challenging bans on dial-a-porn as abridgementsof freedom of speech.   The law under contest is a 1988 federal statute that banssexually explicit telephone message services. The law prohibits anyobscene or indecent communications for commercial purposes overinterstate lines. It provides for fines up to $500,000 and prisonterms up to two years.   Whatever course the Supreme Court decides, there are a number ofarea phone companies which, fearing adverse reaction will affect thetelephone information business in general, are planning to curtailor segregate the pornographic and gab lines.   The revenues are important. One New York state official said theinformation services help subsidize the general telephone services.   Those services which cater to homosexuals are more serious thanother gab lines. They permit callers to talk with a group or``barhop'' by pressing a designated key on push-button phones. Oneoperator of such lines says they perform a real service, all themore critical in the gay community since the AIDs epidemic.   ``Talking to someone before jumping into bed with him is a goodthing to do,'' he says. ``Gays take this more seriously than do thestraights who tend to goof off and hambone on the gab lines.''   Most often dial-it profits are illusory, a gamble at best.Quality equipment is expensive, some devices running $2,000 a lineor more. They force a telephone line, capable of carrying twovoices, to carry six to eight.   Most operations start with bright ideas, some never come tofruition, some fail for lack of continuing innovation. It is acopycat business. Some reserved lines are still vacant. There arethousands more available.   The reason, one said, is that the field is littered with deadbodies, lost fortunes. Yet there are 200 million telephones outthere, each a potential market.   Like many new ideas these days, this one started in the Westernstates. Ominously, that is where some of the harshest controls areshowing up.   But gab lines are not likely to go away. As one frequent callersays, ``It's cheaper than going out.''
