The Republicans have used the pledge as a rallying point in thecampaign, attacking Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakisfor his 1977 veto of a Massachusetts bill that would have penalizedteachers who refused to lead their classes in the pledge.   Dukakis cited an advisory opinion by Massachusetts' highestcourt that the bill was unconstitutional, as well as a 1943 SupremeCourt decision that students could not be forced to salute the flag.   But Quayle said that ``the same mindset that would impede thedaily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance ... could wellsterilize public education of its proper role as a transmitter ofthe values and standards upon which we must rely.''   For him and Bush, Quayle said, the spirit and values of thepledge ``deserve to be transmitted to our children.''   ``To us, they are not hokey or cornball or passe,'' he said.   Quayle chose Liberty Island, where the statue stands in New YorkHarbor, to kick off his fall campaign on this Labor Day holiday.   He also toured neighboring Ellis Island, where millions ofimmigrants entered the country.   Quayle's speech was briefly disrupted by a group ofdemonstrators who chanted, ``Forty-thousand dead from AIDS! Wherewas Dan?'' Quayle's supporters surrounded the group and began acounter-chant, yelling, ``We want Quayle.''   As the protesters were hustled away, the senator told hisaudience, ``I believe in freedom of speech. They have a right tofreedom of speech, but so do I.''   Quayle also travels to Detroit for an ethnic parade beforereturning to Washington to regroup for the heavy campaigning tocome.   On Sunday, Quayle ended a five-day Southern swing and his secondweek of solo campaigning as the Republican vice presidentialnominee.   ``The South is going for George Bush,'' Quayle declared inRichmond, Va. as several hundred supporters cheered.   The Indiana senator was generally well received during his forayinto the South, a region with strong Democratic registration butwhich has been Republican territory in presidential contests.   But there was a smattering of boos Sunday when Quayle wasintroduced to NASCAR racing fans in Darlington, S.C., and therecontinue to be small protests at some of his other appearances.   It was a week that saw further refinement of Quayle's themes ofjobs, peace and prosperity and the emergence of his new fallrhetoric: ``defeatist liberal'' policies of the Democrats versusthe ``enlightened can-do conservatism'' of the Republicans.   It was also a week that saw a profusion of photo opportunitiesfor which GOP strategists believe Quayle is particularly suited. Herelished tossing a football with high school players, for example,and turned it into a metaphor for his campaign. His ``lousy''passing got better, he noted, just like his own politicalperformance.   The controversies about Quayle's military service, personal lifeand academic record for the most part did not follow him on thistrip. And Quayle apparently has become more relaxed with the press,as has his wife Marilyn, who has blamed the media for blowing thecontroversies out of proportion.   But Quayle still has problems at news conferences, aidesconcede. He told reporters in Atlanta that he supported a gradualrise in the minimum wage and then appeared not to know that hisposition was different from that of Bush, who opposes an increasein the minimum wage.   And he criticized the State Department for what he said was areluctance to promote U.S. exports aggressively, but declined tosay in what instances the department had failed.   Aides said later he was just being cautious, unwilling to getinto specifics from memory.</TEXT></DOC>
