The primate of Zambia, Archbishop Emmanuel Milingo, was recalledto Rome in 1982 because of his faith-healing practices. He wasrelieved of his position in Zambia and assigned to a low-rankingRoman Curia post.   According to the latest church statistics, Africa has thehighest number of catechists, religion teachers, in the world,216,000. But it has only 18,000 priests, less than 8 percent of thetotal in Europe.   Officials say the shortage of priests is partly due to thechurch's insistence on celibacy, which runs contrary to the stresson family and children in African culture.   To illustrate the dilemma, a Vatican official recounted how anAfrican cardinal was scolded by Rome for proposing three candidatesfor bishop, all of whom had fathered children. The cardinal wroteback to the Vatican: ``Finding angels is your job.''   On a political level, the role and influence of the church oftendepends on its size in each country _ ranging from Catholicstrongholds such as Zaire, Burundi and Rwanda to Sierra Leone wherethey are latecomers in a Moslem majority.   The pope and the African church have often spoken out againsthuman rights violations and called for peace, reconciliation andnegotiations to settle various civil wars and conflicts.   This sometimes places the church in an adversary role. InMozambique, for example, the church was rebuked for urging directpeace talks with right-wing rebels.   In Burundi three years ago, the government nationalized someseminaries, banned Catholic youth groups and shut down catechismclasses on grounds that the church was trying to discredit thenation. The situation has improved since a military takeover in1987, church officials say.   While Islam has always been a main challenger for converts,Moslem fundamentalism comes as a more recent threat to the church.   The Vatican review of missionary activity listed ``fanaticalpropaganda on the part of groups of radical Moslems'' as one of thechurch's main challenges in Africa.   It specifically named Sudan, where the Moslem-dominatedgovernment in the north is fighting Christian rebels in the south,and Nigeria, where it saw ``dangerous tension and violence createdby Islamic fanatics.''   Fundamentalists in Sudan and Nigeria favor Islamic law. TheVatican criticized its imposition on non-Moslems in a majordocument on racism published in February.   Nigeria's Cardinal Francis Arinze, president of the Vatican'soffice for relations with non-Christians, said in a recentinterview with the Italian Catholic monthly 30 Giorni (30 Days):``It is true that in some African countries, especially among youngconverts, people don't understand why the church dedicates so muchtime and effort to dialogue (with Moslems) when Islam in their owncountry appears so little disposed to dialogue. I understand thedifficulties of these Christians and in a certain way I can saythey are right.''   One of the harshest public attacks on the church came fromLibya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi.   ``Africa is not Christian,'' he declared during a visit toRwanda in 1982. ``Christians are intruders to Africa. Christiansare agents of colonialism. You must wage a holy war so that Islammay spread in Africa. God willing, Islam will triumph in Africaover the religion of colonialism _ Christianity.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 2</NOTE></DOC>
