Police said a 3-day-old cease-fire that ended six months ofSyrian-Christian shelling duels was generally holding, with onlyintermittent sniping duels across the dividing Green Line in thecapital.   Pope John Paul II on Tuesday issued the Vatican's first formalappeal ever to Moslems, pleading for their help in saving Lebanon.In a separate document, he called for a ``mobilization'' byCatholics for Lebanon and announced a world day of prayer for thiswar-torn country.   Under a peace plan issued by a three-man Arab League committee,Lebanon's surviving 73 Parliament members will meet Saturday inSaudi Arabia to discuss the reform plans.   Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite Moslem, predictedat least 60 lawmakers would participate.   The reforms are designed to give more power to Moslems inLebanon. Maronite Catholics have dominated the government,judiciary and army command in Lebanon since independence fromFrance in 1943.   Jumblatt and Shiite militia leader Nabih Berri attacked theproposals, which were welcomed by other Lebanese politicians.   ``The military battle is not over yet and will not be finishedon the basis of a new fragile sectarian compromise contained in thetripartite committee's draft plan,'' Jumblatt told a group ofsympathizers.   Berri said in a statement the reform plan was ``not enough.''   ``The constitution which they want to change gives us more thanthe Arab tripartite committee's plan for reforms,'' Berricomplained.   Under the present system, Lebanon is governed by a Maronitepresident, with a Sunni Moslem prime minister and a ShiiteParliament speaker. Many government jobs were allocated on thebasis of a ratio of six Christians to five Moslems.   At the time the arrangement came about, Christians formed amajority of Lebanon's population. Now they are outnumbered byMoslems.   According to the daily paper An-Nahar, the Arab League peacecommittee has worked out a plan under which the number ofParliament seats would be increased from 99 to 128, to bedistributed equally between Moslems and Christians.   The reforms would limit the president's authority in naming anddismissing Moslem prime ministers and would stipulate that they beelected by Parliament, An-Nahar reported.   The present 99-seat Parliament was elected in 1972, three yearsbefore civil war broke out. Sectarian strife has prevented generalelections and the house has periodically voted to renew itsfour-year mandate. Twenty-six vacancies now exist.   A Sunni Parliament member, speaking on condition he not befurther identified, said leaders of the militias and other fightingforces ``are against any settlement because it will strip them ofthe privileges they enjoyed when their men ruled Lebanon by rifle.''</TEXT></DOC>
