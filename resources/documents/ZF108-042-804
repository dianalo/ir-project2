 New generation TIMSmove beyond earlier systems to provide support for compound documentarchitecture and extended content-based retrieval capabilities.andP;  They arebased on a relational database management system model, feature an openarchitecture and use distributed processing.andM;New generation TIMS provide information system professionals with a shareddatabase environment upon which to build an integrated corporate electronicpublishing system.andP;  Featuring open architecture and distributed processingtechnology, they bring together the multitude of equipment already in use inan organization and distribute information creation, management, retrievaland output functions to the hardware best-suited to perform the tasks.andM;As the central depository for the organization, new generation TIMS ensurethat mixed systems work well together in an integrated environment, thusmaximizing the strategic value of an organization's information resource.andM;Management of all the information structures used by the organizationprovides users with full text retrieval capabilities while maintaining thepublishing characteristics of the original documents.andP;  New generation TIMSare able to manage information structured in a variety of ways.andP;  It can be inthe form of conventional records comprised of fields of relatively short datasuch as customer records.andP;  Other common structures are continuous documentswhich contain long text fields such as newspaper articles or depositions andsectioned documents containing lengthy text that is divided into chapters orsections such as user manuals or technical documentation.andP;  This flexibilityeliminates the need to force-fit information into a single format.andM;TIMS standardsandM;Because a TIMS is the central component of an organization's informationarchitecture, it must offer portability across a wide range of hardwareplatforms and fully integrate with systems already in place.andM;In the past, document creation and publishing was done by a wide variety ofdepartments and users with proprietary systems.andP;  Now, business and governmentare demanding that vendors comply with industry standards to ensure that datacan be traded between systems.andP;  New generation TIMS must integrate with newand emerging software and hardware platforms in order to take full advantageof technology innovations.andM;The key standards in place today are Office Document Architecture (ODA) andOffice Document Interchange Format (ODIF).andP;  Compliance with industrystandards for document architecture and interchange formats permitstransparent document exchange among on-line TIMS and electronic publishingsystems.andM;For instance, Digital Equipment Corporation has developed Digital CompoundDocument Architecture (CDA) and Digital Document Interchange Format (DDIF) assupersets of ODA and ODIF.andP;  TIMS software adhering to these standards willpermit the exchange of revisable-form compound documents with electronicpublishing systems in DEC environments without losing essential documentattributes.andM;A look aheadandM;Systems that support Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), anindependent descriptive markup language, are able to pass actual control ofthe document's attributes to the processors in diverse computing systems.andM;Looking ahead, information systems professionals can prepare for evolvingstandards such as the (U.S.) federal government's CALS initiative by fullyunderstanding the automated publishing process -- including links to productdesign, manufacturing, delivery and ongoing service.andP;  A first step isexamining the organization's publishing needs and identifying those documentsthat support mission critical products and services.andM;Future enhancements to TIMS include navigation aids like referenced topiclists and notes for personal annotation which would aid group documentreview.andM;An idea generator (outliner) and compound document editors are other possiblefuture additions.andP;  Book modeling enhancements may include hyper-link placemarkers and cross references, and cut and paste to word processors.andM;New generations TIMS offer a strategic solution to the opportunities createdby the growth of corporate electronic publishing.andP;  Emerging compound documentstandards and products, along with more cost-effective display and storagedevices, will place new demands on content-based, multi-user retrievalsystems.andM;New generation TIMS available today provide the foundation for these advancesby providing a central depository for the corporate information resource.andO;Organizations that implement a TIMS will experience significant increases incorporate publishing productivity and will be well-positioned to takeadvantage of future innovations.andM;Kenneth Szczesny is vice-president of research and development at informationDimensions Inc. based in Dublin, Ohio.andP;
