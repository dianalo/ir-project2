The purpose of this work is to analyze the feasibility of usingartificial intelligence methods as tools to provide the necessary functionalityto extract information from nuclear data files in a user-friendly manner.For the prototype of this work, a sample of data that can be later enlargedto a complete, evaluated nuclear data base has been used. To implementthis prototype, two approaches have been followed: a conventional approachusing the commercially available Oracle relational data base managementsystem; and an artificial intelligence approach using the Prolog programminglanguage. This prototypic work shows the feasibility of applying artificialintelligence methods to data bases, and represents a first step towarddevelopment of intelligent nuclear data base systems. The characteristicsof the query language from both approaches make the second one preferablefrom a user's point of view. 23 refs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
