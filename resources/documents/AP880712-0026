Kirk suggested Monday that backers of Michael Dukakis, thecertain nominee, were resolving differences with the Jesse Jacksoncamp on about a dozen platform planks.   Jackson's convention manager, Ron Brown, however, left open thepossibility of floor disputes.   ``We want more specificity in the platform and we're moving inthat direction in the discussions,'' Brown said. ``There might besome very serious issues of principle that go to the floor of theconvention.''   Kirk played down that prospect.   ``I don't expect there will be any so-called floor fights on theplatform. There may be differences of opinion. There may beagreements to disagree. All the indications that I have arewhatever differences had existed, they are gradually being workedout,'' he said.   ``I don't expect that anything related to the platform willdistract from the unity that has been built up in the past year,''he added. He said he did not expect any ``prolonged or protractedor ...acrimonious'' debate.   Kirk on Monday released a partial list of the speakers for thefour convention sessions starting in seven days, and said Jacksonhad agreed to the convention schedule.   The schedule _ still without times without all speakers included_ has a major focus Tuesday night on Jackson and the platform.   Kirk said any platform debate would take place late Tuesdayafternoon, before prime time and before Jackson and Sen. EdwardKennedy are scheduled to speak.   One concession to Jackson involved the people who will actuallyread planks of the platform to the convention and to the nation inprime time.   Michigan Gov. James Blanchard, platform chairman, will introducethe document. Then Jackson supporters Rep. Bill Gray ofPennsylvania and Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower willread portions of it.   Also reading planks will be Sen. Barabara Mikulski of Maryland,Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, Rep. Bob Matsui of California andState Sen. Lena Guerrero of Texas.   Monday night at the convention will include the keynote speechby Texas Treasurer Ann Richards. She will be introduced by Rep.Mike Espy of Mississippi _ the first black congressman from thestate since Reconstruction.   Former President Carter will speak earlier on Monday.   Wednesday night's schedule includes a tribute to Rep. MorrisUdall of Arizona. As previously announced, Dukakis' name will beput into nomination by Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton.   On Thursday night, Birmingham Mayor Richard Arrington will speakbefore the nomination of the vice presidential candidate and beforethe party's standard bearers give their acceptance speeches.</TEXT></DOC>
