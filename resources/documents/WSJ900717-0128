Nelson, Philip Morris's vice president forcorporate affairs, presented the cigarette industry'sstandard reply to assertions by critics that the industrytargets children for tobacco-product sales (Letters, June12). It is heartening to see that Mr. Nelson agrees withpublic-health authorities on several substantial matters. Webelieve, however, that Philip Morris should back up itspolicy with action.   The areas of agreement are these: Children should notsmoke, and it is a good thing tobacco-product sales to peoplebelow age 18 are generally against the law.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Nelson goes even further when he says, &quot;We at PhilipMorris do not want minors to smoke.&quot;   Since Philip Morris does not want minors to smoke, itssales to minors are unwanted, and its profits on sales tominors are also unwanted. At a minimum, then, Philip Morris'sresolve to prevent children from using its tobacco productsshould be measured by how it uses its unwanted profits fromsales to kids.   How much is this? Mr. Nelson indicates that &quot;A smallnumber of {the company's} cigarettes are unfortunatelyobtained by minors.&quot;   Given the enormous size of his company's cigarette sales,Mr. Nelson can be forgiven the characterization of its salesto underage people as &quot;small.&quot; These only amounted to 1.5% ofcigarettes sold in the U.S. last year. Still, that's asubstantial number of smokes.   We estimate that last year, 750 packs of Marlboros wereconsumed by kids younger than 18 every minute, and PhilipMorris made a profit of $130 million for the year from theselargely illicit sales to the underage. While these numbersare small compared with overall corporate performance, theyare substantially larger than the company's efforts toprevent smoking by children.   We invite Philip Morris to back up its policy: As aminimum, the company should give its profits on mostlyillegal sales to the underage to state health departmentsacross the country to support programs for the prevention ofnicotine addiction among the young. Anything less has to beregarded as window dressing.   John Slade, M.D.   St. Peter's Medical Center   University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey   New Brunswick, N.J.
