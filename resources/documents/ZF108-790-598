SchroederandM;Although many BASIC developers praise the versatility and speed of newerBASIC languages, market-research analysts tend to downplay both the presentand future role of BASIC in developing commercial software.andM;Paul Zagaeski, senior analyst for Yankee Group Inc. in Boston, estimated thatof the roughly 20,000 software packages available commercially, only 2,000 to3,000 were written in BASIC.andM;&quot;No more than 20 to 25 percent were written in BASIC, and that's a guess,&quot;said Zagaeski.andP;  &quot;It's only that high because of the new versions of BASIC outfrom Microsoft and Borland.andP;  They've proven to be very popular, but themarket's attention is very much focused on C.&quot;andM;For non-commercial software, however, BASIC may still be a strong contender,because many programmers are familiar with it and consider it a standard,said Zagaeski.andP;  &quot;It's something people understand, whereas something like Crequires an extra learning step,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;A lot of programmers are using BASIC for private purposes and areprogramming in other languages as well,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;But the number of thoseprogramming only in BASIC is a lot lower.&quot;andM;Of the almost 40,000 software products in the Data Sources Software file,only 4,080 were written in some form of BASIC, said George Fisher, editor ofData Sources, a computer reference guide published in Cherry Hill, N.J.andM;According to Fisher, &quot;3,849 out of the 4,080 debuted in 1988 or earlier.andP;  Alot are from the '70s and early '80s.andP;  In the last year or two, we haven'tseen anything coming out with BASIC.andM;&quot;BASIC is still very popular, but not for serious business.andP;  To knock outsomething fast, it's fine, but I don't think BASIC is suitable for businessapplications,&quot; he added.andM;Fisher agreed with Zagaeski that the software-development industry is headingtoward Unix and C and tends to leave BASIC for non-commercial developers.andM;&quot;We just don't see BASIC.andP;  I wouldn't doubt that most programmers started offin BASIC or use it for quick and dirty stuff, but off-the-shelf softwareapplications aren't written in BASIC,&quot; said Fisher.andP;  &quot;I don't think BASIC istaken seriously anymore.andP;  It's been outdated by other languages.&quot;andM;&quot;It's the Rodney Dangerfield of languages.andP;  It's the language everybody lovesto say they hate,&quot; said Bruce Tonkin, president and CEO of TNT Software Inc.andO;in Round Lake, Ill.andP;  &quot;But BASIC has a lot going for it.andP;  People need thingslike BASIC that are immediately productive tools.&quot;andM;Tonkin cites speed, low cost and ease of programming as the advantages ofBASIC over other programming languages.andM;&quot;All versions of BASIC have some support for graphics, color andcommunications.andP;  With Pascal or C, you have to purchase add-on libraries,which may not be compatible with your compiler, not to mention the extracost,&quot; said Tonkin.andM;He also points to better speed in BASIC for some operations.andP;  In TNT'sbenchmark testing, BASIC beat Pascal in string operations by a factor of six.andO;&quot;It's how Pascal has to handle string addressing.andP;  BASIC just blew it away,&quot;he said.andM;Tonkin himself feels the attraction for in-house applications written inBASIC.andP;  His company produced six commercial packages last year in BASIC, andmore than a hundred custom applications for clients.andP;  He believes C is toocomplicated and slow for most small companies, which can't pay C programmersfor lengthy applications development.andM;&quot;Small businesses can't afford to pay for something that's going to take sixmonths to develop, so there's a very big chance the application is going tobe in BASIC,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
