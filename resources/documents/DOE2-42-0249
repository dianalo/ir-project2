<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-42-0249 </DOCNO><TEXT>From a pharamacologist's point of view, radioimmunoassay (RIA) representsa highly sophisticated form of bioassay, substituting the classical smoothmuscle strip with a soluble antibody as the biological reactant. Bothassay methods involve indirectly assessing the concentration of the unknownby comparing its effects on a measurable read-out of the reaction evoked(changes in radioactivity, tension, optical density, etc.) with thoseof known concentrations of a standard. Many bioassay technique involvemeasuring biological responses that are mediated by agonist-receptorinteractions. Such interactions usually occur in accordance with thelaw of mass action, similarly to antigen-antibody reactions. The presenceof a radioactive tracer in RIA greatly enhances the sensitivity of thedetection by limiting the mass of the antigen involved, to an extentinversely related to its specific activity. The specificity is also potentiallyincreased in RIA vis-a-vis bioasay by virtue of a smaller number of possiblereagents being present in a highly diluted antiserum than in isolatedcell preparations or whole tissue fragments. Obviously, biological activityof the unknown is inherently measured by the latter, but not necessarilyby the former. Thus, what is measured by RIA is immunochemical behaviourwhich may or may not be related to parts of the molecule responsiblefor biological activity.</TEXT></DOC>
