NATO countries are concentrating their upgrading on improvingfire control systems and providing an enhanced night visioncapability, said the authors of the 1989-1990 edition of ``Jane'sArmored Fighting Vehicle Systems.''   ``Few countries are at present installing new armament which isrequired to penetrate the latest Soviet MBTs (Main Battle Tanks) orto install more armor to increase their battlefieldsurvivability,'' wrote Christopher Foss and Tony Cullen in theauthoritative yearbook.   They said the installation of a larger caliber gun andadditional armor would in most cases overload the vehicles'suspension and reduce the power-to-weight ratio.   NATO's next tank gun is likely to have a caliber of 140mm and befed by an automatic loader that will enable the crew to be reducedto three, they said.   The new gun could be mounted externally with the crew seatedinside the hull. The authors said this provides a number ofadvantages, including a significant weight saving, as the turret oncurrent main battle tanks can weight 20 tons.   ``The weight saved could be used to make the vehicle morecompact or to increase protection levels, especially against topattack weapons,'' the authors said.   ``In addition, it would present an enemy with a much smallertarget.''   The authors said much development work is taking place onconventional tank guns and ammunition, but ``there is little doubtthat in the longer term the future is in other types of weaponsystems for the main armament.''   Liquid propellant is the most likely route for artillery, theysaid. For the main battle tank, the electromagnetic orelectrothermal gun is showing ``much promise.''   The United States is the leader in both areas, they said, in thelatter because of a spinoff from the Star Wars program, formallyknown as the Strategic Defense Initiative.</TEXT></DOC>
