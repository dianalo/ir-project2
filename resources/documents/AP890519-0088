Arens said the Israeli request was included in a letter fromPrime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to President Bush. The foreignminister outlined the proposal, as well as an Israeli plan forelections among the 1.7 million Palestinians, to Vice President DanQuayle today.   Quayle ``endorsed the plan in principle but said he wanted tohear more details,'' said vice presidential spokesman DavidBeckwith.   Disclosure of the Israeli request appeared designed to shiftsome of the emphasis away from the controversial election proposalthat is part of a four-point plan adopted earlier this week byIsrael's Cabinet and parliament.   The plan, formulated under international pressure for Israel toresolve the 17-month uprising in which nearly 500 Palestinians havebeen killed, also calls for an Egyptian-Israeli-American summitmeeting to lend impetus to the initiative and for some 20 Arabstates at war with Israel to talk peace.   Arens told reporters at a breakfast meeting that Israel alreadyhad raised the refugee rehabilitation proposal with Japan and hewill ask the European Economic Community for its help when he meetswith the group in Brussels next week. Money from oil-rich Arabstates would also be welcome, he said.   Israel is hoping that by building new housing and providingemployment opportunities for the 300,000 Palestinians it estimateslive in camps, it will alleviate some of the bitterness thatspawned the Palestinian uprising against the 21-year Israelioccupation, he said.   Arens said that in meetings Thursday with Secretary of StateJames A. Baker III and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft hehad emphasized that the whole Israeli package must have unqualifiedU.S. support that would then generate its acceptance in the Arabworld.   ``We feel it's now the turn of the United States at bat todeclare wholehearted and unreserved support for this initiative,''Arens said.   Arens told U.S. officials that now was not the time to discussdetails of the election proposal, such as which Palestinians wouldbe allowed to participate and whether Israel would agree tointernational supervision.   ``I hope I was successful in convincing my interlocuters here''of that view, he said.   Details could be worked out later but Israel accepts theprinciple there must be free and democratic elections, he said.``Israel is not Panama and Shamir is not (Panamanian Gen. ManuelAntonio) Noriega,'' he said.   Arens said Baker ``promised to go to bat and do what he can tofurther this initiative.''   But a U.S. official, speaking Thursday on condition ofanonymity, said that while the Israeli plan is a good start, itraises many questions. The official said the United States has been``looking at what opportunities it affords and what questionsremain to be answered.''   Baker told Arens the next step will be for Israel to start talkswith Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to discussdetails for the elections and the conditions that would beacceptable to each side, said the U.S. official.   Israeli sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, say theUnited States is pressing Israel to give answers to severalquestions raised by Baker in a letter to Israeli Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir last week regarding the election blueprint.   Arens said he had urged the Bush administration to grant``wholehearted and unreserved American support for this peaceinitiative.'' Such support, he said, ``has a good chance ofenlisting support among other countries throughout the world, andeliciting a positive reaction from the Arab world, and that is anecessary precondition for this thing to really take off.''   The plan envisions balloting to elect Palestinians who wouldnegotiate with Israel for limited self-rule in the West Bank andGaza. Following several years of self-rule, Israel would thenengage in talks on the future of the lands which it captured fromEgypt and Jordan in the 1967 war.   The plan excludes any participation by representatives of thePLO, and Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Husseinhave said they would not accept it unless the Palestine LiberationOrganization approves.</TEXT></DOC>
