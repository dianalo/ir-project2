The students gathered at Seoul's Myongdong Cathedral to call forthe overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo's government and aninvestigation into the death of student leader Lee Chol-gyu.   ``Overthrow the murder regime!'' and ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!''protesters chanted as riot police watched but made no move tointervene.   The peaceful protest strike was called amid growing pressure onstudents to end their violent protests.   South Korean newspapers have praised the Chinese studentprotesters in Beijing for their peaceful tactics in calling forfreedom and democracy. About 3,000 students went on a hunger strikein Beijing on May 13 to dramatize their demands. That hunger strikewas lifted a week later.   South Korean student leaders said Friday they were using thesame tactics as Chinese students. Some students claimed they wouldfast to the death if their demands were not met.   ``We are more determined than the students fasting in China,''one student said.   About 100 students chanted slogans at the cathedral's main gate.Others rested in the cathedral compound or took part in discussiongroups, taking water but no food. Students stayed out of thecathedral itself and administration buildings.   The Korean students are pro-leftist and anti-Western, rejectingWestern democracy as unsuitable for Korean conditions and callingfor an ill-defined ``workers and farmers state.''   The Chinese students are demonstrating for a freer society andan end to official corruption, but are not calling for an overthrowof the communist system.   Radical students in South Korea lack popular support because oftheir extreme views and violent tactics. Some student groups havebeen trying to switch tactics after six riot police officers werekilled May 3 in a clash in the southern city of Pusan.   A seventh trooper injured in the clash died Thursday night,police said.   Radical students and dissidents claim Lee was tortured andkilled by police and are demanding the government admit there hasbeen a cover up. Lee's body was found May 10 in a reservoir nearthe southern city of Kwangju.   Dissident groups called for a major demonstration in Seoul onSaturday to protest Lee's death, but police banned the rally.   Officials deny involvement in Lee's death, although police triedto detain him at a roadblock just before he disappeared. Thegovernment says an autopsy proves Lee was not tortured andofficials speculate he fell into the reservoir.   Posters with color pictures of Lee's bloated body were put upFriday by students in the cathedral compound.   Crowds of up to 100,000 people marched in Kwangju last week todemand the government admit police killed Lee. The demonstrationsalso called for Roh's fall for the bloody suppression of a 1980uprising in Kwangju.   The hunger strikers in Seoul said Friday they also weredemanding Roh's ouster for the Kwangju uprising. Roh was a seniorgeneral during the uprising.   Protesters also chanted anti-U.S. slogans Friday. They claim theUnited States was involved in Kwangju and are demanding expulsionof the 43,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea.</TEXT></DOC>
