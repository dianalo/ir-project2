(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wildcat strikes hit coal fields in fourmore states Monday, keeping a third of the nation's union miners outof work despite a back-to-work request by United Mine Workersleadership.   But Monday night, a judge deprived the wildcat strikers of amajor reason for their walkout by releasing three union leaderswho'd been jailed for encouraging miners to violate a court orderagainst blocking mine entrances in Virginia.   U.S. District Judge Glen Williams' order could end the wildcatstrikes that have spread to nine states, said Chuck Donnelly, anattorney for the United Mine Workers.   Marty Hudson, the primary strike coordinator from Washington;Jackie Stump, president of the UMW's southwest Virginia district;and C.A. Phillips, a UMW international representative, left theRoanoke, Va., jail.   ``It sounds like a cause for celebration,'' Donnelly said.   UMW vice president Cecil Roberts said earlier Monday thattelegrams were sent to the sympathy strikers, asking them to returnto work in accordance with a national contract forbidding such awalkout.   ``Telegrams have gone out,'' said Roberts, breaking the union'slong silence on the impromptu strikes that have shut down more than300 mines. ``I'm sure that that has taken place throughout theunion.''   Despite the request, mines in Alabama, Illinois, Missouri andOhio were hit Monday for the first time, bringing out 5,000 moreUnited Mine Workers members in a sympathy walkout for strikingPittston Coal Group employees.   That brought to more than 27,000 the number of miners on strikeagainst coal operators in nine states, not including the 1,800picketing Pittston in a contract dispute. The UMW has about 80,000active members nationwide.   Roberts said the telegrams were sent because the miners areviolating a national contract signed by UMW members. He said theunion must enforce that pact.   ``It's a serious situation,'' said Jeffrey W. Weber, a spokesmanfor AMAX Coal Co.'s mine in Keensburg, Ill., where 655 miners joinedthe walkout Monday. ``If you look at the big picture, it's verycounterproductive to the future of these miners.''   As has been the case with previous walkouts, the UMW gavecompanies no official reason for the wildcat strikes, but mostpresumed they were related to the Pittston.   Roberts said Monday in an interview from Tazewell, Va., that theunion presumed the same.   ``It's just speculation on our part as to why they're out, butpeople from the field are very upset on fines that have beenassessed against the union'' for civil disobedience in the Pittstonstrike, Roberts said.   ``Our position has been that we have no difference with theUMW,'' said James Strickland, the director of public affairs forDrummond Coal Co. in Jasper, Ala., where all 1,900 union minerswalked out Monday.   ``We have no word from the union as to what they're up to,'' hesaid.   Virginia was taken off the wildcat list Monday when 794 IslandCreek Coal Co. employees returned to work at mines in BuchananCounty. They had been out since Thursday.   ``We're back in full swing,'' said Island Creek spokesman NoelJones.   Despite the wildcat strike's end in Virginia, other industryofficials pointed to the new walkouts and said there was no way toexpect an end to the strike.   ``I think that's pretty unpredictable,'' said Steve Anderson, aspokesman for Westmoreland Coal Co., which had 850 workers out lastweek but only 100 _ all in West Virginia _ on picket lines Monday.   ``When you consider the expansion over the weekend, I find ithard to believe (that it's ending).''   The unauthorized walkouts began last week after a UMW rally inCharleston to protest Pittston's failure to sign a nationwidecontract and to protest fines and jail terms assessed against unionmembers in Virginia.   Pittston wants its own contract that would include mandatoryovertime, Sunday work and a cut in pension benefits. The UMW insiststhat the company sign the national contract, which would requirePittston to pay into the national pension fund and keep mines closedon Sundays.   About 1,600 UMW employees walked off their Pittston jobs inVirginia and West Virginia on April 5 after working more than 14months without a contract. The strike spread to Pittston's Kentuckyoperations Monday, idling an additional 200 UMW members.   Pittston last week declared negotiations at an impasse, whichallowed it to implement its latest contract offer. UMW leaders arerequired by law to present that offer to their membership.   Eight people were arrested Monday in Alexandria, Va., aftersympathizers of the striking miners snarled commuter traffic headedinto the nation's capital, where the UMW is based. The protestersallegedly traveled two or three cars abreast at speeds of 5 mph onhighways heading into Washington from northern Virginia, accordingto Virginia State Police spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell.   Police spotted about 100 sympathizers, most of whom had signs intheir car windows or displayed UMW flags on their radio antennas,Caldwell said.   The more than 27,000 miners off work Monday included 16,000 inWest Virginia; 3,900 in Alabama; 2,500 in Pennsylvania; 1,750 inIndiana; 1,270 in Kentucky; 1,100 in Ohio; 650 in Illinois; 338 inMissouri, and 200 in Tennessee.</TEXT></DOC>
