NEGA contendedthat the proposals would clarify the intent of the regulations and reducethe cost of compliance without compromising pipeline safety. RSPA consideredthe NEGA letter a Petition for Rulemaking (P-15).A preliminary review of the NEGA proposals culminated in a letter to NEGAdated Feburary 28, 1984. This letter explained that three of the problemsaddressed by NEGA had been eliminated by rulemaking. The letter explainedfurther that under Executive Order 12291 rulemaking actions must be basedon a demonstrated need and on the costs and benefits of the contemplatedaction.In response NEGA resubmitted a slightly modified list of 71 recommendations.By this final rule, RSPA partially grants the NEGA petition and makes additionalminor changes to Part 192 based on its review of the standards.<ITAG tagnum="84">NEGA Proposed Changes to Safety Standards</ITAG>As NEGA proposed, the acronym ``MAOP'' has been added to the definitionof ``maximum allowable operating pressure'' in andSection; 192.3. NEGA arguedthat, ``The letters MAOP are often used in these standards and should becontained in the definition.'' Contrary to this assertion, a review ofthe regulations did not reveal a single use of the acronym. However, thisNEGA misconception is extremely common, and we believe reflective of thealmost universal use of the acronym MAOP in the gas industry and RSPA.Since the acronym could be applied to the phrase ``maximum actual operatingpressure,'' albeit rarely and unintentionally, it will clarify the regulationsto associate MAOP unambiguously with ``maximum allowable operating pressure.''In andSection; 192.59(a)(1), referring to the standards of manufacture ofnew plastic pipe, NEGA recommended the following be deleted: ``except thatbefore March 21, 1975, it may be manufactured in accordance with any listededition of a listed specification.'' This language was inserted in 1975when this section was revised to require the use of the ``latest listededition of a listed specification'' for the manufacture of plastic pipe.(Amdt. 192-19, 40 FR 10472, March 6, 1975) The purpose of the languageNEGA proposed to delete was to permit operators to use stockpiled pipemanufactured prior to the effective date of the amendment.Twelve years have passed since this wording was inserted. It no longerserves a useful purpose, and RSPA agrees that it should be deleted. Inaddition, the concept of a ``latest listed edition'' is no longer validbecause editions of listed specifications (those set forth in Section Iof Appendix B) are no longer listed in sequence. Also, andSection; 192.7(c)was amended previously to provide that an earlier edition of a specificationmay be used for materials manufactured according to that edition, providedthat it was listed at the time of such manufacture. Therefore, RSPA hasrevised andSection; 192.59(a)(1) to read, ``It is manufactured in accordancewith a listed specification.'' Section 192.59(b)(1), concerning used plasticpipe, has been amended similarly.RSPA agrees with NEGA's proposed revision of andSection; 192.161(f), conceringbranch connections. The word ``detrimental'' has been inserted between``prevent'' and ``lateral,'' so that only ``detrimental'' movement at branchconnections has to be prevented. The revised text of this section makesit consistent with the intent of the regulation.To express better the intent of andSection; 192.177(a)(1), governing thelocation of bottle-type holders, the word ``storage'' has been deletedfrom ``storage site.'' With this change, a bottle-type holder may be locatedat any ``site'' that meets the standards.RSPA also has revised the lead-in text of andSection; 192.355(b), as NEGArecommended, by deleting, ``The outside terminal of each service regulatorvent and relief vent must_'' and substituting, ``Service regulator ventsand relief vents must terminate outdoors, and the outdoor terminal must_.''The current wording could be misinterpreted as being conditional, meaningif the vent terminates outside, it must comply with the requirements ofandSection; 192.355(b). This has never been the intent. This section wasbased on USAS B31.8_1968, a voluntary consensus standard covering gas piping.Paragraph 848.33 of the current edition of this standard, ANSI ASME B31.8_1986,includes the following, ``All service regulator vents and relief vents,where required, shall terminate in the outside air * * *'' RSPA believesthat the foregoing reflects current and acceptable industry practice aswell as the original intent of andSection; 192.355(b).<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Changes to Safety Standards</ITAG>RSPA has made several additional clarifying changes not addressed in theNEGA petition. The first corrects a typographical error by replacing ``conjection''with ``conjunction'' in andSection; 192.281(e)(2).RSPA has clarified andSection; 192.191(b), concerning plastic fittings. Thenote that appears below the table in andSection; 192.191(b) states that thepressures shown are the same as would be determined by applying the designformula for plastic pipe in andSection; 192.121 and the limitations of andSection;192.123. This is no longer true. The design formula that appears in andSection;192.121 was amended previously to apply a uniform design factor of 0.32to all plastic pipe regardless of class location. Thus, the table is superfluousand misleading, implying a differentiation in class location requirementsbeyond the 100-psig limitation for Classes 3 and 4 locations and distributionsystems under andSection; 192.123(a).RSPA has deleted the current andSection; 192.191(b) and replaced it withthe following: ``Thermoplastic fittings for plastic pipe must conform toASTM D2513.'' This removes the existing conflict with andSection;andSection;192.121 and 192.123, and addresses thermoplastic fittings in a manner consistentwith current practice and level of public safety. The 1981 edition of theASTM D2513 document, ``Standard Specification for Thermoplastic Gas PressurePipe, Tubing, and Fittings,'' has been incorporated by reference in Part192 for other purposes related to the use of plastic pipe (see andSection;andSection;192.59 (listed specification), 192.63, 192.281, and 192.283). Because the1981 edition is the applicable edition incorporated by reference in Part192 (andSection; 192.7) and operators have it available, it will serve forpurposes of the new andSection; 192.191(b) until updated through a separaterulemaking.The remaining changes relate to confusion regarding required test pressures.Currently, leak test requirements for pipelines (other than service linesand plastic pipelines) to be operated ``at or below 100 p.s.i.g.'' areaddressed in andSection; 192.509. Required test pressures for establishingthe MAOP of steel pipelines to be operated ``at 100 p.s.i.g. or more''are addressed in andSection; 192.619(a)(2)(ii). These sections set forthconfusing requirements for 100-psig steel mains. Section 192.509(b) requiresa minimum test pressure of 90 psig for mains to be operated at 1 psig ormore, while andSection; 192.619(a)(2)(ii) requires a minimum test pressurefor mains in Class 1 locations of 110 psig, and higher in other class locations.Operators often avoid the more stringent requirement of andSection; 192.619(a)(2)(ii)by setting the MAOP of steel mains at 99 psig and conducting a 90-psigleak test. It is obviously not the intent of the standards to make 100psig a unique operating pressure. RSPA has removed the confusion in the following way. The titles and lead-intext of andSection;andSection; 192.507 and 192.509 have been revised to changetheir statements of applicability. As amended, the test requirements ofandSection; 192.507 apply to pipelines operating at a hoop stress of lessthan 30 percent of SMYS and ``at or above 100 p.s.i.g.,'' instead of thecurrent ``above 100 p.s.i.g.,'' bringing steel pipelines to be operatedat 100 psig under andSection; 192.507. The words ``at or'' have been deletedfrom ``at or below 100 p.s.i.g.'' in the lead-in text of andSection; 192.509,thus removing 100-psig pipelines from the requirements of that section.The result of these changes is that test requirements for pipelines tobe operated at 100 psig are clearly addressed in andSection; 192.507 andthe confusion over the current test requirements of andSection;andSection;192.509(b) and 192.619(a)(2)(ii) is eliminated. Compliance is simplified,while no operational changes are required. Although Subpart J prescribes the pressure test requirements for new, replaced,and relocated pipelines, the minimum test pressures needed to substantiatea proposed MAOP are prescribed in Subpart L in andSection; 192.619. To makethis separation of related requirements easier to comprehend, the words``and with andSection; 192.619'' have been inserted after the words ``inaccordance with this subpart'' in andSection; 192.503(a)(1). This changeexplicitly directs the operator to the test pressure requirements, thuseliminating potential confusion without requiring operational changes.Section 192.625(g), which pertains to interim standards for odorizationof gas, in transmission lines, has had no legal effect since final standardsbecame effective under andSection; 192.625(b) on January 1, 1977. It is thereforeremoved. <ITAG tagnum="84">Enforcement Procedures </ITAG>Under RSPA's procedures governing the assessment and collection of civilpenalties for violation of a pipeline safety regulation, order, or statute,the person charged with the violation may pay the proposed civil penaltyand close the case. (andSection; 190.209(a)(1)). RSPA considers such actionby a respondent to be an admission of violation by the respondent. It istherefore relevant to the determination of the amount of any future civilpenalty assessment under andSection; 190.225. That section requires considerationof a ``respondent's history of prior offenses.'' To make this clear, andSection;190.209(a)(1) is revised by adding the phrase ``with prejudice to the respondent''after the words ``close the case.'' Under andSection; 190.227(a), civil penalty payments are no longer remittedto the Chief Counsel's office. Certified checks or money orders are madepayable to the ``Department of Transportation'' and sent to Chief GeneralAccounting Branch (M-86.2), Accounting Operations Division, Office of theSecretary, Room 2228, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street,SW., Washington, DC 20590. <ITAG tagnum="84">Impact Assessment </ITAG>This final rule is considered to be nonmajor under Executive Order 12291and is not significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44FR 11034, February 26, 1979). Because it includes no substantive revisionsthat could be expected to require significant changes in operator proceduresor compliance burdens, and because the economic impact would be slight,a full regulatory evaluation is not required. The agency certifies under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Actthat this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. This final rule makes a number of editorial and other clarifying changesto Part 192 and does not impose any substantive new safety requirements.The changes were considered in September 1987 by the Department's gas pipelineadvisory committee, the Technical Pipeline Safety Standards Committee,which approved them without comment or modification. Each change makesthe regulations more easily understood or states more clearly the originalintent which has been evident in practice but not stated as lucidly aspossible. For example, the change to andSection; 192.355(b) makes clear thatservice regulator vents and relief vents must terminate outside. This hasalways been the intent of the requirement, but the existing language allowsan interpretation that such an outside terminal is optional. Because ofthe minor and principally editorial nature of the changes, and becausethey will not effect either implementation or enforcement activities, priornotice and opportunity for public comment are unnecessary. Therefore, inaccordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, the changes are final.In addition, because the two changes to Part 190 modify agency rules ofpractice and procedure, the Administrative Procedure Act does not requireprior notice and opportunity for public comment on the changes. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>49 CFR Part 190 Pipeline safety, Penalty, Enforcement procedures. 49 CFR Part 192 Pipeline safety, Plastic pipe, Plastic fittings, Supports and anchors,Service regulators.
