The building was destroyed in the blaze.    The Chicago-based defense products and chemicals maker said it doesn't know what caused the fire, which was fueled by 100,000 pounds of rocket propellant that was loaded into the first stage of a rocket. It appeared that the fire erupted as a casting was being removed from the first-stage of the fuel-loaded rocket, though the company said it wasn't certain of that.    The same Brigham City MX missile plant was in the news this past summer. As previously reported, last July the Air Force withheld some payments to the company because of &quot;poor workmanship&quot; on some of the rockets. Thomas S. Russell, a company spokesman, said those problems have since been corrected and regular payments resumed.    &quot;I don't believe (those earlier problems) are related to the fire,&quot; Mr. Russell said. &quot;But until we know the exact cause of the fire, we can't say for sure.&quot;    All of the fuel in the rocket burned before the fire was extinguished, according to wire service reports from Utah. The company said very few employees were in the area at the time because of the holiday schedule.    Morton Thiokol employs about 7,500 workers at the Utah operation, where it also makes space systems, including the Shuttle booster rockets, and tactical systems. Mr. Russell said the fire would force the closure of only a portion of the MX operations, which employ about 1,000.    The buildings are spread over several square miles and other operations weren't endangered, Mr. Russell said. The fire broke out early yesterday morning, about five miles from the site where the company tests Space Shuttle booster rockets.    The destroyed building was 35 feet high, 60 feet wide and 70 feet long, the Associated Press reported.    The fire was one in a string of major accidents at the plant in four years, according to state records, AP reported. On March 25, 1986, an explosion destroyed a building during a drying process for rocket fuel used in Trident missiles, but no one was injured. The blast caused an estimated $1.5 million of damage to a remote-operated HMX oxidizer dryer building.    In June 1985, lightning touched off an explosion in a propellant-mixing building. In March 1984, 14 workers were injured in a fire that started while a Space Shuttle motor segment was being filled with solid fuel. And in August 1985, three workers were injured in a fire fueled by nitrogen-based material. </TEXT></DOC>
