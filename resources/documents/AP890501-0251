Without that gain and other one-time charges against earnings,net income in the quarter would have risen only 3.5 percent, saidLodwrick M. Cook, Arco's chairman and chief executive officer.   For the three-month period ended March 31, Arco's net earningstotaled $704 million, or $4 per share, up from $401 million, or$2.20 a share, in the first quarter of 1988. Revenue fell to $3.96billion, down 14 percent from $4.61 billion a year earlier.   The results included a $634 million after-tax gain from the saleof 53.75 percent interest in Lyondell in January.   Cook, who reported the results at the company's annualshareholders meeting, said that discounting one-time gains andcharges, profit would have been $415 million.   The gains were partially offset by $345 in after-tax charges forunspecified environmental expenses, anticipated losses on theplanned sale of Arco Solar Inc. and a charge related to the sale ofthe company's aluminum operation in 1985.   Cook also said that the March oil spill in Alaska, which forceda temporary halt to shipments from the port of Valdez, cost thecompany about $10 million after taxes.   Arco spokesman Albert Greenstein said the loss stemmed from acombination of reduced production and lower oil flow through theAlaska pipeline over a 12-day period after the March 24 spill.   ``About 3.2 million barrels net to Arco was not delivered,''said Albert Greenstein. ``So when you look at reduced deliveries toArco and reduced production _ we had to reduce production in one ofour refineries _ the overall after-tax loss was $10 million. Mostof that relates to loss of delivered crude.''</TEXT></DOC>
