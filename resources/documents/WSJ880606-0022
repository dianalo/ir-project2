Bulkeley (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> EDP </IN><TEXT>   The computer revolution in education was supposed to be here by now.    Enthusiasts in the early 1980s predicted that children soon would be learning more from desktop computers than they ever had from teachers. The Carnegie Commission said computers would have to be added to the three R's. And many expected computers to squeeze out Big Chief notepads and flashcards.    But now, even after spending more than $2 billion on an estimated 1.7 million personal computers, educators are hardpressed to spot the heralded revolution in the schoolhouse.    &quot;The computer-learning revolution predicted back in the early 1980s just hasn't happened,&quot; says education professor Henry Kepner Jr. of the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee. Marc Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, a Washington research group, says, &quot;A lot of kids in this country can now distinguish between a computer and a telephone. . . . I think we should expect a great deal more.&quot;    What derailed the revolution? Educators have a long list of reasons: School computers remain scarce. The early computers that schools bought weren't very good, and the software for teaching is still lousy. Most teachers never get adequate computer training. And using computer programs to teach classes has turned out to be much more difficult than expected.    &quot;The mistake was thinking that if we put in a lab or two, computer education would happen by magic,&quot; says Joseph Arangio, headmaster of Mario Umana High School of Science in Boston. His school has four computer labs for its 900 students, but only five of the 75 teachers use them. &quot;We had real high expectations that it was going to be the solution to all sorts of problems,&quot; he says.    Most educators and researchers remain convinced that computers eventually will find a place in the schools. And in the few cases where schools already are regularly using computers to teach various subjects, the results have been encouraging. &quot;Most studies show that students using computer-aided instruction will achieve mastery of a subject 10% to 30% faster,&quot; says Charles L. Blaschke, president of Educational Turnkey Systems Inc., a technology consulting firm in Falls Church, Va. Computers work especially well in special education, remedial education for dropouts, and with gifted children, he says.    Adds Allen Glenn, an education professor at the University of Minnesota: &quot;In my heart, I think there is tremendous potential and opportunity. But we can't answer yet whether it changes the score on the SAT&quot; college-entrance exams.    The biggest stumbling block has been the shortage of computers in schools. While 96% of all U.S. public schools have computers, most of them simply put 10 to 20 of the machines in a single computer laboratory, which various classes share. Because of the limited number of machines, even the minority of science and math classes that used computers averaged less than 15 minutes of daily use for each student, according to a Research Triangle Institute study for the National Science Foundation; most other subjects used computers even less.    &quot;There's perhaps one computer for every 35 to 38 students -- barely one per classroom,&quot; says John Schram, a senior vice president of educational publisher Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston. &quot;That has had as big a limiting effect as anything.&quot;    Moreover, sharing the labs among several different subjects and teachers makes scheduling difficult. And often the distribution of computers doesn't match the need. Washington, D.C., put labs with 10 computers each in every school -- enough machines, perhaps, for one of its elementary schools with 300 pupils but not for a high school with 1,500 students.    The shortage isn't likely to disappear any time soon. Despite steadily dropping prices, personal computers remain daunting investments for school systems used to buying one new $15 textbook a year for each student. At the same time, school systems are under pressure to spend more to raise teachers' salaries and cut class sizes. Says Richard Riley, Maine's educational technology coordinator: &quot;Total student expenditures in Maine are around $2,700 a year per student. If you purchase a computer, that's half the budget for a student.&quot;    Similarly, in Pittsfield, Mass., the school board approved spending $180,000 to boost the number of computers next year, but the mayor rejected the entire plan. &quot;It's easy to cut, because in their minds it's considered almost a luxury item,&quot; says Irene Vassos, the school system's computer specialist.    Meanwhile, schools that jumped on the bandwagon early may have to replace obsolete machines before even thinking about adding more computers. Jeanelle Leonard, director of computer-literacy training in the Washington, D.C., schools, says that this year, instead of expanding the number of machines, the school system will replace five-year-old Commodore computers because of soaring repair costs.    Another big hurdle is the lack of software suitable for teaching. Because the market is less lucrative than for commercial software, there are fewer education programs to choose from -- and the products aren't as fast or as easy to use as business software.    &quot;You need resources before you get a package as good as a spreadsheet,&quot; says Alan Lesgold, a professor of psychology and a learning specialist at the University of Pittsburgh. &quot;You don't see venture capitalists trying to corner the market in third-grade history.&quot; The educational-software market amounted to only $153 million last year, the Software Publishers Association estimates, out of total software sales of $2.9 billion.    Robert Pease, a computer enthusiast who heads the science department at Conard High School in West Hartford, Conn., says: &quot;For most (software) packages, teachers have to reinvent the wheel. They have to learn (how to use it) themselves first and then tailor it for their activity. It increases class-preparation time.&quot;    The problem isn't only getting computers and software, though; it's also knowing how to use them. Researchers say many schools merely teach students the basics of using computers rather than putting the machines to work as tools for studying other subjects. That's like requiring courses in pencils instead of in writing, says Celia Einhorn, a computer-education coordinator in Albuquerque, N.M.    As a result, computer familiarity is all most students get. Educational Testing Service reported in April that a survey of 24,000 students found that 87% of 11th graders had used a computer, and more than 95% could identify pictures of a floppy disk and a keyboard. But when it came to completing tasks with a computer, students apparently hadn't learned much: For questions about using spreadsheets and data bases, for instance, the scores barely topped random guessing.    Getting teachers to use computers in their courses has been a big problem, too. Few teachers publicly criticize computers for fear of appearing technologically backward, but many ignore the machines after one or two frustrating experiences. &quot;It takes a tremendous amount of time to become familiar&quot; with the computers, says a high-school language teacher in Newton, Mass. &quot;I've been too busy teaching to integrate the computers.&quot;    An Educational Testing Service survey found that 32% of the computer-education coordinators in elementary schools were uncomfortable with computers.    Yet, schools aren't giving teachers the computer access they need to feel at ease using the machines. &quot;We'd hoped to put a computer into every teacher workroom,&quot; says Ms. Einhorn, the Albuquerque computer instructor. &quot;But the school board said, 'Work with the kids first.'&quot; As a result, most of the teachers didn't get the chance to become familiar with the computers on their own before having to use them in the classroom.    Ms. Leonard of the Washington, D.C., schools says: &quot;We expected the teachers to really embrace the technology and take off with it.&quot; Instead, three years after the first computers were installed, the school district had to begin requiring that educators take computer courses.    Adding to the problem is that few colleges require education students to use computers or to take courses on using them to teach. And teachers who haven't been taught with computers often don't see ways to use them. Iris Weiss, a Chapel Hill, N.C., researcher, recalls a seminar on computer education where one man said, &quot;If these methods are so good, how come none of my teachers at Harvard teaches this way?&quot;    ---            How Computers Are Used -- If Used at All   How students use computers at school                            Elementary       High School   Drill and practice              60%               18%   Programming                     10%               48%   Word processing                  7%               20%   Other                           23%               14%   Source: 1985 survey, Center for the Social Organization of Schools, Johns Hopkins University.
