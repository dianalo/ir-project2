The clinical diagnosis NPMcan be very difficult. However, mammography combined with ultrasoundexamination may lead to the correct diagnosis. In the mammogram a poorlymarginated area of increased density can be seen, in case of an abscessthere is a more circumscribed lesion. On ultrasound examination thereis a well-circumscribed or ill-defined echo-poor lesion. The throughtransmission is not descreased and septa are frequently observed. Ifthe radiological features correlate with the results of aspiration andcytological examination, the diagnosis NPM can be made and surgical interventioncan be avoided. We describe the value of mammography and ultrasound examinationin the diagnosis of non-puerperal mastitis in a group of six patients.</TEXT></DOC>
