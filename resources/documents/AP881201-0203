Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, state Attorney General AnthonyCelebrezze Jr. and Environmental Protection Agency director RichardShank declined to release details of the agreement on the FeedMaterials Production Center in Fernald.   Formal announcement of the deal was scheduled Friday, theofficials said.   Gov. Richard Celeste said Wednesday he would not accept anyagreement in which the federal government would not pay the completecost of the Fernald cleanup, estimated at $1 billion.   Steve Wyatt, a DOE spokesman in Oak Ridge, Tenn., said it wasreasonable to assume that the federal government will pay for all ofthe cleanup.   Joe La Grone, manager of Oak Ridge, Tenn., operations, said theagreement would be a consent decree subject to federal courtapproval.   La Grone said the government will have already spent $355 millionby the end of fiscal 1989 on cleanup and workplace safety effortsalready under way.   The 37-year-old plant processes and molds uranium for use in theEnergy Department's production of nuclear weapons. which are made atother locations.   Production was halted by a strike Oct. 7.   State and DOE officials had been working toward a cleanupagreement prior to lawsuits the state filed against the DOE in 1986and 1987. The talks continued after the lawsuits were filed. Ohiowants a settlement that would give the state authority to overseethe cleanup.   The state blames the DOE for alleged contamination of air andwater at the 1,050-acre plant, 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati.   The plant sits above the Great Miami River aquifer, a watersource for 2 million people. The Energy Department has admitted theplant has emitted at least 300,000 pounds of radioactive uraniumdust into the atmosphere during three decades of operation.   Shank said the state is concerned that contaminated wastes fromthe plant could eventually pollute the aquifer and create a majorhealth hazard. Water sampling has not revealed evidence of notablecontamination in regional public water supplies, but monitoring willcontinue, Shank told reporters.   Neighbors have sued the department and its former operator,National Lead Co. of Ohio, accusing the plant of polluting theenvironment with radioactive materials, creating a health hazard andruining property values. The lawsuit also is pending in U.S.District Court.</TEXT></DOC>
