The new regulations deal directly with how much moneybanks need to back up their various activities. But a largelyunforeseen side effect, some investment bankers and analystssay, is that big European and Japanese banks will unloadportions of their vast holdings of securities issued by someof the world's largest and best-known corporations.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. banks aren't as likely to be put into this positionbecause they have been adjusting to the long-discussed newrules for the past few years.   As the big European and Asia banks start selling theirsuddenly undesirable securities, &quot;investors will have anopportunity to buy companies' debt that they were never ableto buy before,&quot; says Stephen Posford, a managing director atSalomon Brothers International Ltd.   No one knows how much the banks will sell, but thepotential amount of securities that could come spewing ontoworld markets is enormous. Banks and savings institutionsaccount for 62% of loans to domestic non-financial companiesand individuals in Germany, 63% in Britain and 51% in France.In the U.S., which could become more nearly the normfollowing full implementation of the new rules, thecomparable figure is 39%.   To reach the 39% level, says Dennis Keegan, a managingdirector at Salomon Brothers, German banks would have to shedthe equivalent of $510 billion of assets, British banks $310billion and French institutions $190 billion. European banksin the aggregate would unload an amount &quot;equal approximatelyto the size of the whole U.S. government bond market,&quot; hesays. &quot;Just half this number would be double the size of theEurodollar market.&quot;   Although bond markets will bear the initial brunt ofselling under the new bank rules, some bankers saycontinental European and Japanese banks also may beginunloading some of their large stock holdings in domesticcompanies. Even more likely, the big multinationalcorporations themselves might sell new stock to lower theirincreased funding costs.   The new rules were drafted by the Bank for InternationalSettlements and agreed to by bank regulators in the world's11 major industrial countries. They were initially designedto create a level playing field among global banks. The keyrule specifies that banks involved in cross-border businessmust have capital equal to 8% of their total assets,including loans. This minimum and other rules apply to thebanks' own funds, not money invested by their trustdepartments for clients.   Other rules weight assets according to their perceivedriskiness. Loans to private companies carry a maximumrisk-weighting of 100%. That means for every loan of 100dollars, marks or French francs, a bank must back it witheight dollars, marks or francs of capital.   By contrast, loans to the 24 industrial countries that aremembers of the Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment carry a zero risk-weighting. Thus, no capital isrequired if a bank buys, say, U.S., German or Britishgovernment bonds. Cash also is zero-weighted.   In between are credits to other banks in OECD countries at20% and residential mortgages, which are weighted 20% to100%, depending on whether they are home mortgages (50%),government-agency issued mortgage-backed bonds, such asFederal National Mortgage Association securities (20%), orprivate bonds backed by mortgages. Thus, unless a corporateloan carries a sufficiently higher yield, a bank will earnmore money making loans in these other categories.   The bottom line, says Mr. Keegan of Salomon Brothers, isthat &quot;it will be much more attractive for institutions tohold government paper,&quot; and &quot;corporate debt will prove moreexpensive for them to hold.&quot;   That is especially true of high-rated companies, many ofwhich even now pay very little above banks' own cost of fundsfor loans. Analysts predict these companies will balk atpaying interest rates that are high enough to make itprofitable for banks to lend under the new capital rules.Instead, the analysts say, they will sell securities inpublic markets.   For Siemens AG and General Electric Co. (U.K.), &quot;bank debtwill be too expensive,&quot; says Mr. Keegan. Other companies thatanalysts say are in similar positions include InternationalBusiness Machines Corp., German chemical company Hoechst AG,auto makers Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) and Volvo AB,Dutch food and consumer goods giant Unilever NV, and Britishdrug maker Glaxo Holdings PLC.   Many of these companies already sell bonds as well asborrow from banks. But many of these issues are held soheavily by banks that they are scarce in the market, where asa result they trade at higher prices than equivalent U.S.Treasury securities.   Investment bankers predict this situation won't continueafter the companies are forced to sell more debt publicly.Thus, they say, investors will have a further opportunity tobuy higher-yielding bonds sold by some of the world's topcorporations.   Bankers expect European banks to repackage loans they'vemade and sell them as securities, a technique already widelypracticed by U.S. banks to sell mortgages and credit-cardreceivables. Securitization allows a bank to remove debt fromits balance sheet, earn fees, show a better return on capitaland still maintain a relationship with a customer.   &quot;This will be more prevalent going forward; it couldresult in new, creative securities,&quot; says Thomas W. Seaman, amanaging director at Merrill Lynch International Ltd.&quot;There's no question that the {BIS} capital targets havecaused a reassessment of banks' strategies.&quot;   The biggest beneficiaries of the new BIS rules will begovernments, particularly lower-rated borrowers such asGreece, Portugal and Belgium. Banks will be able to lend tothem without adding to their capital. &quot;Some governments willget money at rates they might not be worthy of,&quot; says RobertSteel, a managing director at Goldman Sachs InternationalLtd.   Will investors be able to handle the expected flood ofsecurities banks unload and companies sell? Most analyststhink so.   Pension-fund and investment managers have more and morecash to invest. By the end of the decade, corporatepension-fund assets in Japan, Canada and the 12 countries ofthe European Community are expected to nearly triple to $4.33trillion from $1.51 trillion at the end of 1990, according toAsset Strategy Consulting, a Los Angeles-based advisory firm.And while U.S. pension funds won't grow as fast, theirpurchases of foreign securities are expected to soar,according to Greenwich Associates, a financial consultingfirm based in Greenwich, Conn.   Not everyone thinks investors will snap up this additionalsupply of securities, however. James H. Leigh-Pemberton, adirector at S.G. Warburg Securities, contends that &quot;justbecause {money managers} don't have to worry about BIScapital rules doesn't mean they are going to be a betteralternative for funding than a bank; it depends on what theirclients want them to do for them. From time to time, theywill be a much cheaper source of funding than banks; attimes, they will be more expensive.&quot;   Others argue it was too many banks chasing too fewcustomers that in the first place allowed top-tier companiesto borrow cheaply. And even with an expected shakeout inworld banking, these people contend there will still beplenty of over-capacity in the world banking system.   Nonetheless, William Vincent, a bank analyst at UBSPhillips andamp; Drew, a unit of the Union Bank of Switzerland,says that bank loans repackaged as tradable securities &quot;ispotentially one of the biggest capital markets of 1990s.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
