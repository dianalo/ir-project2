Rapidly solidified specimenswere prepared by a twin-roller quenching apparatus in the form of long,thin ribbon, whose cooling rate was estimated to be about 10/sup 5/ K/s.Under such a cooling rate, the maximum solubility of zirconium in solidaluminium was extended to about 1.0 wt.%. However, it was extended upto 1.7wt.% by addition of 1.0wt.% silicon. With the increase of siliconcontents, the microhardness of Al-Zr alloys were increased as well. Ageingof supersaturated Al-1.7wt.%Zr1.0wt .% Si solid solution appeared tooccur in three sequential stages; I. Precipitation of silicon as finespherical particles which harden the alloys, followed by II. discontinuousprecipitation of metastable zirconium phase which produce remarkableage hardening of the alloys and finally III. formation of coarse equilibriumzirconium phase.</TEXT></DOC>
