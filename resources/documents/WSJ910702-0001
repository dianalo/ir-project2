Officials of the Philadelphia-based regional Belltelephone company said the outage, which began shortly after11 a.m. and lasted throughout the workday, was similar to onethat struck Washington, Maryland, Virginia and West VirginiaWednesday.</LP><TEXT>   Late last night, a Bell Atlantic official said thatinvestigators were looking into possible sabotage or acomputer virus in the phone system failure, according to theAssociated Press.   Pacific Telesis Group's Pacific Bell unit also reported ashort outage in San Francisco, bringing to four the number oflocal network failures within the past week. All four can betraced to a relatively new signaling system that speeds callsthrough the network and allows the companies to offer suchnew services as Caller ID and Call Trace.   Alarmed by the rash of service disruptions, Bell Atlanticofficials have organized a task force from BellCommunications Research Corp., the research arm of the sevenBaby Bells, to pinpoint the cause and find the solution. Inthe meantime, the phone company is installing a softwarepatch that it hopes will prevent more trouble.   The companies are zeroing in on equipment and softwarefrom DSC Communications Corp. of Plano, Texas, whichdelivered the signaling equipment and related softwareinvolved in all four recent failures. A DSC spokesman saidthe products involved &quot;have been tried and proven for years.We have to look at all the possibilities.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
