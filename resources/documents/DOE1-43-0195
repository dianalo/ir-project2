The results obtained are compared with data on LBH/sub4/ (L=Li,Na,K,Cu) complexes. Trends to change in geometric parametersand energy characteristics in series of similar systems are considered.Geometric parameters of the BH/sub 4/ group in similar configurationsare found to transfer well from one molecule to another. A tridendateconfiguration (t) is turned out to be a basis for complexes of non-transitionelements of the HLBH/sub 4/ and LBH/sub 4/ type and bidentate (b) oneis close to it by the energy, but in contrast to LBH/sub 4/ the energy(b)-(t) gap increases with the increase of the L ordinal number. Transitionto complexes of d-metals leads to destabilization of configuration tdown to inversion of relative stability b -andgt; t. In L(BH/sub 4/)/sub 2/interaction of bridge hydrogens destabilizes to maximum configurationst, t with tridentate-coordinated BH/sub 4/-groups.</TEXT></DOC>
