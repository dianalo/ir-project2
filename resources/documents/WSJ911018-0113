The verdict against Eli Lilly andamp; Co., is believed to beone of the largest DES verdicts since the drug was taken offthe market in 1971.   But as the jury was about to reconvene yesterday toconsider punitive damages, meant to deter future wrongfulconduct, attorneys in the case told the state Supreme Courtjudge the parties had reached a settlement of the entirecase, the terms of which are confidential.</LP><TEXT>   The judgment for Margaret Perrotte, said lawyers familiarwith the case, is the first jury award in New York to a childof a DES mother in more than a decade. The verdict also marksthe first time a jury made an award to the spouse of analleged DES victim; Ed Perrotte was awarded $550,000.   The verdict is important despite the settlement,plaintiffs' lawyers said, because of its size and because itmay lead to more DES cases being filed and give encouragementto plaintiffs with cases pending.   When the jury returned its verdict on Wednesday there wasconfusion about the damage award. The jury granted Mrs.Perrotte $2 million for past pain and suffering but it wasunclear that day whether the jurors intended to award her anadditional $200,000 or an additional $200,000 a year for upto 51 years.   Three jurors interviewed yesterday said they intended thetotal verdict for the couple to be $12.75 million. But BettePeterson, a spokeswoman for the Indianapolis drug company,maintained that the total verdict was $2.75 million. Eitheramount would have been among the largest verdicts ever in aDES case, according to Hugh Moore, a products liabilitydefense lawyer at the Chicago law firm of Lord, Bissell andamp;Brook.   Diethylstilbestrol, or DES, has been linked to vaginal andother types of cancers in the daughters of women who took thedrug. The cases, which have been filed across the country,are difficult to win because of the long period between whenthe mother takes the drug and when her child discovers theinjury. In addition, it's often impossible to pinpoint thespecific manufacturer of the drug taken by a patient.   Ronald Benjamin, a Binghamton, N.Y., lawyer for Mrs.Perrotte, said that he overcame some of those obstacles byuncovering old prescriptions signed by the doctor of Mrs.Perrotte's mother and by canvassing drugstores in a 40-mileradius of her childhood home. &quot;I think plaintiffs' lawyers{in DES cases} are pretty happy today,&quot; said Mr. Benjamin.   &quot;To avoid the risk inherent in future litigation bothparties have reached a mutual settlement,&quot; said Ms. Peterson.She said Eli Lilly strongly disagreed with the verdict, whichshe said was the first award in any DES case against thecompany since 1987.   The case pitted veteran product liability defenseattorney, Russell H. Beatie of the New York law firm Brown andamp;Wood, against Mr. Benjamin, a sole practitioner from upstateNew York who was handling his first DES case.   Mrs. Perrotte, 28 years old, of Candor, N.Y., who had tohave a radical hysterectomy and two-thirds of her vaginaremoved as a result of vaginal cancer, said she contacted Mr.Benjamin after she saw his advertisement on television.   Jurors in the case said afterward that they based thecalculation of the award on their belief that Mrs. Perrotte'scancer would return and because she would not be able to havea child.   &quot;We wanted her to get money soon so she could pay theagency fees to adopt a child,&quot; said juror Mary Ann Long, amanager of public relations at American Express Co. Thejurors also said they found Lilly's expert witnesses lesscredible because the experts argued that there was no proofat all linking DES to cancer.   Jay E. Mayesh, a product liability defense attorney at NewYork-based Stroock andamp; Stroock andamp; Lavan, said that while thisvictory is unusual and large, it would not change overalldefense tactics in DES cases.   ---   BANK-FRAUD CHARGES are being dropped after appeals courtdecision.   Federal prosecutors in Dallas sought and won a newindictment of a former Texas thrift owner last week to meetfresh bank-fraud criteria set by a federal appeals court justseven weeks ago.   The case is one of at least three that are affected by theappeals court's ruling that separate bank-fraud charges can'tbe applied to each alleged action in a single fraud scheme.   The federal appeals court in New Orleans ruled in lateAugust that six bank-fraud charges against Woody Lemons,former chairman of Vernon Savings andamp; Loan Association inDallas, were part of a single bank fraud. The Fifth U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Mr. Lemons's conviction onthose charges, reducing his prison sentence to 10 years from30 years.   Since then, prosecutors in Dallas have scrambled to makesure existing cases and cases under investigation match theappeals court's interpretation of the bank-fraud statute,said U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins.   The new indictment of Jarrett E. Woods Jr., former ownerof the defunct Western Savings Association of Dallas, changedthree bank-fraud charges to charges of illegal participationin a savings-and-loan transaction. The original bank-fraudcharges were among 37 counts in Mr. Woods's highly publicizedindictment a year ago. Mr. Woods's lawyer declined tocomment.   Earlier, federal prosecutors obtained a new indictment ina case related to the failed Shamrock Federal Savings Bankthat changed the bank-fraud charges. The prosecutors also wona 90-day delay in the trial of a case related to CaprockSavings andamp; Loan Association in order to seek a new indictment.   All of the affected cases are pending in federal court inDallas, although federal prosecutors in other parts of Texassay they are also examining their cases for possibleconflicts with the appeals court ruling.   Mr. Collins said his office will ask the appeals court toreconsider its decision but, in the meantime, will continueto review and revise pending cases. &quot;We're used to reactingand cleaning up after some little untidy mess the circuit{court} makes,&quot; he said.   ---   FORMER PRUDENTIAL BROKER accuses firm's lawyers ofmalpractice.   Doris Edelman, formerly a broker for Prudential SecuritiesInc. in North Miami Beach, Fla., sued Prudential's generalcounsel, Loren Schechter, deputy general counsel, JamesTricarico, and Herbert Marek, the in-house attorney whohandled an arbitration case. The case, over the allegedchurning of a client's account by Ms. Edelman, resulted in a$1.5 million award against Prudential and Ms. Edelman inApril. Churning occurs when a broker conducts excessivetrading in an account to generate commissions.   Ms. Edelman, whom the company, a unit of PrudentialInsurance Co. of America, had defended during thearbitration, was fired 10 days after the case was decided.The decision was one of the largest punitive damage awardsever against a securities firm.   In the suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Ms.Edelman accuses the attorneys of legal malpractice and ofhaving a conflict of interest by representing both her andthe company. She also alleged that the firm's counselrejected a reasonable settlement of the case.   A spokesman for Prudential said, &quot;The lawsuit is withoutmerit.&quot; He said he was commenting on behalf of the companyand the three individual defendants, who couldn't be reachedfor comment.   The suit said, &quot;The legal representation of Ms. Edelman .. . was negligent, sloppy, poorly prepared and fell far belowthe standards in the legal community for adequate legalrepresentation in a matter of this nature and complexity.&quot;   In the suit, Ms. Edelman said that in handling clients'accounts at Prudential, she followed all the rules andregulations of the firm. The suit said that when questionswere raised about the account, she was assured by hersupervisor that the accounts were handled appropriately.   The suit seeks compensatory damages of $5 million andpunitive damages of $25 million. &quot;Because of the barrage ofadverse publicity concerning the {arbitration} award, Ms.Edelman has been unable to find other employment within thesecurities industry,&quot; the suit said. &quot;Her securities licenseis in jeopardy.&quot;   ---   CHILD IN A COMA will remain on life-support systems, judgerules.   &quot;Jane Doe,&quot; a 13-year-old Georgia girl, has been inScottish Rite Hospital in Atlanta since May. According tophysicians, the child is terminally ill with irreversible,degenerative brain disease. Saying that continued treatmentconstitutes &quot;medical abuse&quot; by inflicting pain withoutoffering any hope of recovery, medical providers sought to&quot;discontinue&quot; or &quot;de-escalate&quot; extraordinary life-supportprocedures.   While the child's mother, for the most part, accepted thehospital's conclusions, the father didn't. Citing religiousconvictions that his daughter could be restored to health, hehas asked the hospital to continue any and all measures tosustain her.   Yesterday, in Fulton County Superior Court, Judge LeahSears-Collins ruled that artificial feeding and breathingsystems must remain attached to the child. &quot;If eitherparent,&quot; she said, &quot;makes the decision to continue {theirchild's} life, that decision must be respected.&quot;   In her ruling, Judge Sears-Collins asked Georgia'sattorney general to appeal her order immediately to the stateSupreme Court in order that a higher body be allowed todefine &quot;proper rules and procedures&quot; in what she called anunprecedented case.</TEXT></DOC>
