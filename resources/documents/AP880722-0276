The overall June increase, which matched the rise for May, wouldamount to an annual inflation rate of 4.2 percent if prices climbedat the same pace for 12 straight months, the Labor Department said.   Grocery store prices rose a sharp 0.7 percent, but there seemedto be little effect from the summer's drought other than the huge5.4 percent rise in poultry prices and the even steeper 6.6 percentgain in egg costs.   Cereal and bakery prices, not yet showing the full effects ofthe drought, were up 0.4 percent.   Grocery store prices, reflecting upward pressures before thedrought took hold, had risen 0.5 percent in May and 0.8 percent inApril.   As for meat, analysts expect prices to fall later in the summeras producers, facing staggering feed prices, sell off parts oftheir herds. But Donald Ratajczak, an economist who conducts hisown price surveys from the Georgia State University in Atlanta,said in advance of today's report that some retailers have not yetpassed their lower wholesale prices on to consumers.   Indeed, pork prices rose 1.2 percent last month while beefprices gained 1.3 percent.   As for energy, gasoline costs, driven downward by worldwidedrops in crude oil prices, dipped a significant 0.9 percent afterrising 1.6 percent in May.   Clothing prices fell 0.3 percent after rising a strong 3.8percent through the first five months of 1988. Department analystsattributed the decline to larger than usual markdowns in prices forwomen's clothing.   The 0.3 percent seasonally adjusted gain in the Consumer PriceIndex left the annualized inflation rate for the first half of 1988at 4.4 percent, the same as for all of 1987.   The index itself stood at 118.0 in June, meaning that aselection of goods costing $100 during a 1982-84 base period wouldhave cost $118 last month, 50 cents more than in the precedingmonth and $4.50 more than a year ago.   Excluding the effects of the volatile food and energycategories, retail prices rose 0.4 percent in June, double May's0.2 percent increase.   The department gave these details of June's price changes:   _Cooking oil prices were up 0.4 percent while dairy productcosts fell 0.2 percent. Prices of fruits and vegetables edgeddownward 0.1 percent. Restaurant meal prices gained 0.4 percent.Food prices, including meals eaten outside the home, rose 0.6percent.   _Energy prices overall were down 0.2 percent. Fuel oil pricesdropped 0.6 percent while natural gas and electricity costs gained0.4 percent.   _Prices for infants' and toddlers' clothing were off 1.0percent, followed by a 0.8 percent drop in the costs of women's andgirls' clothing and a 0.1 percent dip in men's and boys' clothing.   _Housing costs rose 0.3 percent, the same as in May and April.   _Medical care expenses were up 0.4 percent, less than in recentmonths but 6.4 percent greater than at this time last year.   _New car prices rose 0.3 percent, faster than the 0.1 percentgains of April and May.   The government's monthly inflation reports are attractinggrowing attention as the financial markets worry about the impactof rising prices on the strength of the economy.   Factories last month operated closer to capacity than at anytime in eight years, raising fears that strong demand will freemanufacturers to raise prices. Meanwhile, unemployment fell to 5.3percent, a 14-year low, and heightened concern that workers will beable to demand higher wages.   Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, aWashington-based consulting firm, said consumer resistance tohigher prices is discouraging inflation outside the food and energycategories.   ``Clients wring their hands and tear their hair. In manyindustries _ restaurants, women's apparel, electronics _ you canvirtually only sell something if it's on sale,'' she said.   Ratajczak warned that the long-term outlook for inflation is notas good as over the next month or so. After meat prices fallbecause of an increase in slaughtering, prices will go up and stayup for at least a year in response to a shortage of animals.   Also, the low unemployment rate will begin to be felt in anincrease in the price of services, he said.   ``An upward tilt in inflation appears fairly inevitable,'' hesaid. ``Next year could be a problem year, but it won't beexplosive.''</TEXT></DOC>
