Furthermore, there will beno adverse effects on competition, employment investment, productivity,innovation, or on the ability of United States based enterprises to competewith foreign based enterprises in domestic or import markets. This actionis not expected to substantially effect budget outlay or effect more thanone agency or to be controversial. The net result is to provide betterservice to rural communities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background/Discussion</ITAG>On April 2, 1987 (52 FR 10577), FmHA published a proposed rule on propertymanagement and security servicing for SFH loans. FmHA now publishes theseproposed revisions for final rule. In addition, FmHA published a proposedrule on September 1, 1987, (52 FR 32935) on security servicing for SFHloans. This final rule addresses and incorporates those revisions proposedon September 1, 1987. FmHA publishes in final these two proposed rulesat the same time since they affect the same CFR Parts and publication concomitantlywill minimize the burden on FmHA field personnel and the general public.On May 23, 1988 (Part II) (53 FR 18392), FmHA published a proposed rulepursuant to the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 which includes proposedchanges to 7 CFR Parts 1955 and 1965. That rulemaking action primarilyaffects farmer program (CONACT) portions of the aforementioned Parts. Thisrulemaking action primarily affects housing borrowers/properties and hasno impact on the intent or changes in 7 CFR Parts 1955 and 1965 being proposedas a result of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987.<ITAG tagnum="84">Programs Affected</ITAG>These programs/activities are listed in the Catalog of Federal DomesticAssistance under Nos:<ITAG tagnum="26">10.404 Emergency Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.405 Farm Labor Housing Loans and Grants</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.406 Farm Operating Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.407 Farm Ownership Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.410 Low Income Housing Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.411 Rural Housing Site Loans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.414 Resource Conservation and Development Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.415 Rural Rental Housing Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.416 Soil and Water Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.417 Very Low Income Housing Repair Loans and Grants</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.418 Water and Waste Disposal Systems for Rural Communities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.419 Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.421 Indian Tribes and Tribal Corporation Loans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.422 Business and Industrial Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.423 Community Facility Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.427 Rural Rental Assistance Payments</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Consultation</ITAG>For the reasons set forth in the Final Rule related Notice(s) to 7 CFRPart 3015, Subpart V, the following programs are excluded from the scopeof Executive Order 12372 which requires Intergovernmental consultationwith State and local officials: 10.404-Emergency Loans, 10.406-Farm OperatingLoans, 10.407-Farm Ownership Loans, 10.410-Low Income Housing Loans, 10.416-Soiland Water Loans, and 10.417-Very Low Income Housing Repair Loans and Grants.The following programs are subject to intergovernmental consultation withState and local officials: 10.405-Farm Labor Housing Loans and Grants,10.411-Rural Housing Site Loans, 10.414-Resource Conservation and DevelopmentLoans, 10.415-Rural Rental Housing Loans, 10.418-Water and Waste DisposalSystems for Rural Communities, 10.419-Watershed Protection and Flood PreventionLoans, 10.421-Indian Tribes and Tribal Corporation Loans, 10.422-Businessand Industrial Loans, 10.423-Community Facility Loans, and 10.427-RuralRental Assistance Payments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact Statement</ITAG>This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR Part 1940, SubpartG, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the determination of FmHA that thisaction does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affectingthe quality of the human environment and in accordance with the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-90, an Environmental ImpactStatement is not required. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>This final rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of theRegulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612).

Five comments were received during the commentperiod. Three comments were received late, but nevertheless were consideredin the scope of this review. Of the eight comments, three were from FmHAfield employees, and five were from sources outside FmHA. Generally, thecomments were favorable with two comments (from outside FmHA) stronglysupporting the proposed rule. Several comments were outside the scope ofthe proposed rule, and three commentors strongly opposed certain sectionsof the proposed rule. The major concerns appeared in the areas of suitabilitydeterminations, downpayment requirements and property which does not meetthe Agency's definition of ``Decent, Safe and Sanitary'' (DSS). The areaof suitability determinations was not addressed in the proposed rule. Downpaymentrequirements will be discussed below, and there appeared to be confusionover properties that do not meet DSS standards. The commentor is underthe misconception that all ``unsuitable'' properties do not meet DSS standards.Generally, unsuitable properties do meet DSS standards. The terms, ``unsuitable''and ``non DSS'', are not interchangeable. For example, an inventory propertywith an inground swimming pool would be considered unsuitable for retentionin the program due to an above modest feature (the pool), however thisproperty may be decent, safe and sanitary. To clarify this area of potentialconfusion, FmHA has changed the terms ``suitable'' and ``unsuitable'' to``program'' and ``nonprogram'' respectively. We believe these changes moreaccurately describe the property and will prevent such confusion in thefuture. A summary of the comments relating to the April 2nd proposed rule by sectionarea and changes to the proposed regulation which are being incorporatedinto the final rule are as follows: Section 1955.113 One commentor suggested that the period of time suitable (program) propertyis available for sale to anyone after the 45-day retention period be setby the State Director consistent with market conditions in the State. Weconcur this suggestion has merit, however, we believe consistency withinFmHA sales methods throughout the country is more valuable. A uniform policyalso makes it easier to establish listing notices, exclusive broker contracts,open listing agreements, etc. Another commentor suggested that three administrativeprice reductions be authorized with the State Director having authorityto authorize additional price reductions instead of the two administrativeprice reductions as proposed. FmHA considered this when developing theproposed rule, however felt that the two larger administrative price reductionsshould sell the property within a reasonable period of time. If not, FmHAneeds to review the situation to determine why the property is not selling.A new appraisal may be necessary or additional marketing efforts may promotea timely sale. The regulation has been revised to require that a higherlevel office review the case file, including documentation of marketingefforts, after the two price reductions and provide guidance on futuresales efforts. Should FmHA later determine that additional administrativeprice reductions should be authorized, regulations will be published tothat effect. An additional change has been incorporated into the final rule that willmake the date administrative price reductions take effect easier to compute.For computation purposes, each month will be considered to have thirtydays. Section 1955.114 Most commentors were in favor of the longer retention period during whichsuitable (program) property is offered exclusively for sale to eligible(program) applicants, and suggested even longer periods. One commentorsuggested the retention period be left at 30 days with the State Directorhaving the authority to establish a longer period of time if necessary.Again, we believe that such a retention time is best left uniform throughoutthe country for consistency. FmHA policy is to sell suitable (program)property to eligible (program) applicants. This policy was establishedinternally by the Agency to further the objectives of our Housing program.The retention period has been increased 300 percent since 1985. FmHA, however,also has an obligation to dispose of inventory property as quickly as possibleto relieve the Government of the tremendously high costs of retaining propertyin inventory. We believe the 45-day retention period is more than sufficienttime for an eligible (program) applicant to make a prudent decision regardinghomeownership. It is quite apparent to FmHA, and to any other seller, thatif property remains unsold after a month and one-half of active marketing,additional marketing efforts are needed. It should also be noted that althoughsales are then opened up to any purchaser, an eligible (program) applicantalways has preference on suitable (program) property sales. Section 1955.116 One commentor recommended that FmHA include the estimated cost of repairsin advertisements of properties that do not meet ``Decent, Safe and Sanitary''(DSS) standards. We do not concur with this recommendation. First, FmHAdoes not always estimate the cost of repairs when determining the suitabilityof a house for retention in the program. Second, when FmHA does estimatesuch a cost, it is an estimate of how much it will cost FmHA to contractfor such repairs/renovations. This may be significantly different fromthe costs for an individual purchaser to make such repairs/renovations.We believe that listing the repairs that are necessary to make the housemeet DSS standards is sufficient information for a potential purchaserto make a prudent decision. One commentor strongly opposed the proposed modification in the DSS languagethat would eliminate the ``standard all encompassing'' language currentlybeing used. The commentor states that after a purchaser has made repairs/renovationsas required by the sales agreement/quitclaim deed and FmHA has inspectedsame, the Agency has further responsibilities to ensure that the structuremeets DSS standards. FmHA disagrees with this comment. FmHA has no legalor statutory basis by which to require that the purchaser of non DSS inventoryproperty make repairs/renovations beyond those required to remove the DSSoccupancy restrictions in the deed to the property. Such a policy, in additionto being unenforceable, would effectively make non DSS properties unsalable.The commentor further suggests that regulations be expanded to includethe requirement that the property be reinspected before the deed restrictionis removed. We concur that the regulation is silent in this regard, however,believe it is implied in the instruction and is being accomplished nationwide.Regardless, we have incorporated this requirement in the regulation. The same commentor suggested that FmHA demolish any property which hasbeen determined unsuitable (nonprogram) due to location or design. We believesuch a policy is too harsh and hasty. A property which has been determinedto be unsuitable (nonprogram) due to location may be a structure that isremotely located. A farmer, business or other concern may have interestor use for such a property. Similarly, a property which is unsuitable (nonprogram)due to design may have uses beyond a housing-unit for very-low and low-incomeFmHA borrowers. We have however, expanded our regulations on sale of propertyindependently as chattel and vacant land. Section 1955.118 Comments were extremely favorable regarding our proposal to reduce downpaymentrequirements on sales to ineligible (nonprogram) applicants, with two exceptions.One commentor, however, strongly opposed the proposal stating that FmHAhad no justification for such action. Section 510(e) of the Housing Actof 1949, as amended, provides the Secretary with broad authority by whichto sell acquired property. A downpayment is not required by statute. FmHAreduces downpayment requirements to assist the Agency in selling inventoryproperty. FmHA continues to acquire property into inventory at a steadyrate. The costs of retaining these properties in inventory are staggeringand present a problem with which the Agency and other Departments are veryconcerned. We believe the commentor's concern is that ineligible (nonprogram)applicants will be purchasing suitable (program) inventory property. Thereis nothing to preclude such an action now, yet FmHA sells very few suitable(program) inventory houses to ineligible (nonprogram) applicants. Eligible(program) purchasers always have preference in suitable (program) propertysales. They are provided a minimum of 3 exclusive 45-day retention periodsin which to purchase a suitable (program) inventory property. The Agencyhas provided very prudent means by which to sell suitable (program) propertyto eligible (program) applicants. The other comment opposing the reduction in downpayment requirements suggestedthat the reductions only be provided to eligible (program) applicants.There are no downpayment requirements from eligible (program) applicantsfor the purchase of suitable (program) inventory property. One commentorstrongly supported the reduction in the downpayment requirements and suggestedFmHA go further by eliminating the downpayment requirement for owner/occupantineligible (nonprogram) terms financing. FmHA does not concur with thissuggestion. Generally, applicants who will qualify for this type of creditwill have incomes in excess of FmHA program income levels. We feel a twopercent downpayment, together with payment of closing costs from personalfunds, is reasonable for this type of debtor to be able to purchase a home.Section 1955.130 Comments on this section were generally favorable with one exception. Thecommentor does not believe FmHA should pay a real estate commission toa real estate broker who purchases the property for his/her own use. Asmentioned in the proposed rule, FmHA policy in not paying commissions inthese instances is inconsistent with the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment (HUD) and the Veterans Administration (VA). The policy is alsoinconsistent with private sector sales. FmHA has no reason not to pay acommission in these instances. The commentor suggests a real estate brokerwill not submit an offer from an eligible (program) purchaser but willwait to submit their own offer to purchase the property. Real estate brokersare professionals who are licensed to sell real estate and are guided byprofessional ethics as well as State laws. It would be unconscionable andpossibly unlawful for a real estate broker not to submit a valid offerto the seller. This comment was not incorporated into the final rule. Sections 1955.147 and 1955.148No comments were received on these sections. However, further changes havebeen made in the regulation to clarify how suitable (program) propertyis to be sold by sealed bid or auction. The changes require the bid depositsfrom eligible (program) purchasers to be the same as an earnest money depositand not the full ten percent currently required.Section 1965.126Three comments were received on this section. One recommended the downpaymenton ineligible (nonprogram) transfers be based upon the market value ofthe property, or the unpaid debt, whichever is lower. We concur with thisrecommendation. In some areas, the FmHA debt exceeds the market value.To not make the downpayment requirement prohibitive, we agree that samebe based upon the market value or unpaid debt, whichever is lower.Another commentor opposed the revision. They believe allowing an ineligible(nonprogram) purchaser to assume the debt of an eligible (program) borroweris an inappropriate use of loan funds. Our existing regulations, whichalready permit the assumption of an FmHA loan on ineligible (nonprogram)terms, require a 10 percent downpayment to consummate the transaction.FmHA has only proposed to reduce the downpayment. This is an assumptionof an existing debt, therefore no new loan funds are involved. Further,when the debt is assumed, it is assumed on ineligible (nonprogram) terms.The interest rate is generally increased, a downpayment is required, andthe term of the loan is reduced. We believe the proposed rule will assistborrowers in selling their property should the borrower so desire. Thechoice of who purchases the property is strictly their own.Section 1965.128One comment was received relating to this section. The commentor suggestedthe authority to assign security instruments be expanded to include accountsthat have been accelerated after all appeals have been exhausted. We concurthis authority should be granted as was done in the predecessor regulationto Subpart C of Part 1965 and have incorporated this suggestion into thisfinal rule.A minor change affecting the wording in the proposed rule is incorporatedinto this final rule. In the proposed rule, an assignment of security instrumentsis authorized when ``A junior lienholder has foreclosed its lien and ispaying FmHA in full.'' This should have read if ``A junior lienholder isforeclosing and is paying FmHA in full.'' There would be no reason to providean assignment of security instruments to a junior lienholder if they havealready foreclosed, have title to the property, and wish to pay off FmHAin full.Other SectionsOne commentor suggested that FmHA revise its regulations on suitabilitydeterminations since they relate closely to the proposed rule. The commentoralso stated the proposed regulations did not contain a definition of ``suitable''(program) and ``unsuitable'' (nonprogram) property. 7 CFR Part 1955, SubpartC, does contain the definition of suitable (program) and unsuitable (nonprogram)property. The commentor should refer to andSection; 1955.103. Suitabilitydeterminations are made pursuant to Subpart B of Part 1955, which containsguidance on same. FmHA recognizes that clarification of how suitabilitydeterminations are made may be necessary and will be publishing proposedrevisions to Subpart B of Part 1955 either concomitantly or shortly afterthis final rulemaking action.Another commentor suggested that FmHA regulations be expanded to permitthe reclassification of property from suitable (program) to unsuitable(nonprogram), and vice versa. Further, if FmHA sells a property as unsuitable(nonprogram), the Agency should permit the designation to be changed tosuitable (program) should the property later be repaired/renovated to meetsuch standards. FmHA concurs with the first comment and will be proposinglanguage that would permit changes in suitability determinations in anotherrulemaking action, however, it should be noted that generally, an ``unsuitable''(nonprogram) property will remain an unsuitable (nonprogram) property.The second half of the comment is a moot issue. If a FmHA property is soldfrom inventory to a nonprogram purchaser, it loses its label of suitable(program) or unsuitable (nonprogram). Should an FmHA applicant desire topurchase the property at a later date, the property would be consideredfor financing under the applicable program regulation regardless of itsprevious suitability designation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments_September 1, 1987 Proposed Rule</ITAG>The proposed rule published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 32935) on September 1, 1987, providedfor a 60-day comment period. Three comments were received from the generalpublic. Five written comments were received from FmHA field personnel whichdealt primarily with minor clarifications and internal agency management.Of the eight comments, two (from outside the Agency) were received late,however, they have been considered in the development of this rulemakingaction.Of the eight comments received, seven strongly supported the proposed rule.Only one commentor opposed the proposed regulation changes. However, itappears from the content of this letter, the commentor did not fully understandthe proposed rule. The commentor believes the proposed regulation is anattempt to preclude FmHA program applicants from purchasing propertieswhich are involved in the ``debt exceeds value'' situation. This is completelyadverse to the intent of the regulation. Current FmHA regulations permitthe Agency to receive an amount less than the market value of the propertywhen the sale is to a purchaser financing the property from a source otherthan FmHA. Since there is cash at the closing, FmHA will accept paymentin full for less than market value so necessary and authorized closingexpenses can be paid to complete the sale. The problem arises, however,when an FmHA borrower desires to sell to an FmHA applicant and the applicantwill be assuming all or a portion of the existing FmHA debt (at marketvalue). Since there is no money at the loan closing, the selling expensescannot be paid, thus precluding the sale from an FmHA borrower to an FmHAapplicant. The proposed regulations would allow FmHA to pay for such expenses(by voucher) thus permitting program transfers. The true beneficiariesof this action are FmHA applicants. We believe this document and reviewof the proposed rule should clear up any confusion of the commentor.A different commentor strongly supported the proposed regulation, however,felt that FmHA should only authorize payment of authorized selling expenseswhen the sale is to an FmHA program applicant. We do not concur with thiscomment. The intent of this rulemaking action is to assist borrowers whoseFmHA debt and authorized selling expenses exceed the market value of theproperty. For these parties, there is no alternative beyond voluntary conveyanceof foreclosure. Who purchases the property is strictly a matter betweenthe FmHA borrower/seller and a potential purchaser. FmHA does not believeit should prescribe or interfere in who can purchase these properties. Another commentor opposed the requirement that a financial statement betaken from the borrower to ascertain whether they have adequate funds topay any or all of the authorized selling expenses. The commentor reaffirmedthe Agency's intent to assist the borrower in selling their property andavoiding a voluntary conveyance. The proposed policy of taking a financialstatement for a voluntary sale was questioned as being counterproductiveto the intent of the proposed rule. Further, the proposed rule only affectssituations where the debt and authorized selling expenses exceed the marketvalue of the property. In such economically depressed areas, it is extremelyunlikely that an FmHA borrower will have funds to pay towards closing.The commentor believes the policy is counterproductive and overly burdensomeon the public. We partially concur with this comment, however, for apparentreasons, FmHA does need to know if the borrower has funds available topay their own closing expense. The regulations have been expanded however,to include that if a current financial statement is on file, a new statementwill not have to be taken.  Another commentor recommended that the County Committee action requiredfor certain release from liability actions be amended. County Committeesare generally used in the Farmer Program area only and are unfamiliar withhousing issues. We concur with this comment. In the past, FmHA was limitedby statute for certain of our release from liability actions. Recent changesin the Housing Act of 1949, as amended, now provide us with broader releasefrom liability authorities and we have revised our regulations accordingly. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Other Revisions  </ITAG>The following revisions are included in this final rule and were not publishedfor proposed rule as they clarify the intent of the existing regulation,make changes required by law, make necessary reference changes to otherFmHA regulations as the result of changes in Part 1955 and changes determinedto be within the scope of internal agency management. A summary of themore significant changes by section number are as follows:  <T3>Subpart A of Part 1955  </T3>1. Section 1955.4 is expanded to give the Administrator, and AssistantAdministrators, the authority to delegate any authority granted to saidposition in this subpart to a State Director. Also, the section is revisedto correct the titles of employees under the jurisdiction of the HawaiiState Director.  2. Section 1955.10(a) is expanded to provide County Supervisors with theauthority to accept a voluntary conveyance of a single family housing (SFH)property regardless of the amount of the indebtedness.  3. Section 1955.10(d)(3) is expanded to provide an exception to the requirementthat a financial statement be taken for SFH voluntary conveyances sinceit is Agency policy to accept such voluntary conveyances with release fromliability if the borrower has cooperated in good faith, satisfactorilymaintained the property, and otherwise fulfilled the covenants of the loanagreements to the best of the borrower's ability.  4. Section 1955.10(e) is revised to give the State Director the authorityto procure appraisals from a source outside FmHA for SFH voluntary conveyances. 5. Section 1955.10(h) is revised to provide guidance to FmHA personnelon how to handle unsatisfied accounts after a voluntary conveyance.  6. Section 1955.11(b) is expanded to permit FmHA to pay necessary and properfees, approved by the bankruptcy court, to secure the conveyance of propertyfrom a trustee in bankruptcy.  7. Section 1955.15(a)(2) is expanded to give District Directors the authorityto accelerate Multiple Family Housing (MFH) loans which are within theirloan approval authority.8. Section 1955.15(b) is expanded to provide guidance on initiating stepsto meet the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act. Thisaffects properties which are over fifty years old and which the Governmentwill likely acquire at the time of the foreclosure sale. Since this isgenerally a lengthy process, FmHA plans to initiate such steps prior toforeclosure instead of after acquisition to prevent delays in selling theproperty.9. Section 1955.15(f) is expanded to provide the State Director with theauthority to obtain appraisals by contract from a source outside FmHA whennecessary for FmHA to bid at a foreclosure sale.10. Section 1955.20(d) is expanded to give the State Director the authorityto obtain chattel appraisals by contract from a source outside FmHA whennecessary.Subpart B of Part 19551. Section 1955.53 is expanded to amend the definition of ``ContractingOfficer'' consistent with Federal Acquisition Regulations.2. As mentioned in the discussion of the comments on the April 2, 1987,proposed rule, FmHA has revised its terminology of ``suitable'' and ``unsuitable''property as they relate solely to SFH and MFH loans. To better fit theintent of the property classification, ``suitable'' property is renamed``program'' property, and ``unsuitable'' property is renamed ``nonprogram(NP)'' property. This new terminology better describes the property, andwill remove the negative stigma the term ``unsuitable'' connotes. Similarly,in Subpart C of Part 1955, the terms ``eligible'' and ``ineligible'' termsfinancing, are changed to ``program'' and ``nonprogram'' terms financing.This will provide consistency in terminology throughout property management.Therefore the definitions of ``suitable'' and ``unsuitable'' property containedin paragraph 1955.53 and throughout Subparts B and C of Part 1955, havebeen revised. The term ``suitable'' property is still retained, however,for property other than SFH or MFH (generally FP property).3. Section 1955.54 is expanded to give the Administrator, and AssistantAdministrators, the authority to delegate any authority of said positionin this subpart to a State Director. This paragraph is also revised tocorrect the titles of employees under the jurisdiction of the Hawaii StateDirector.4. Section 1955.55 is expanded to include a new paragraph on emergencyadvances when liquidation is pending.5. Section 1955.57 is added to provide guidance on inventory property containingunderground storage tanks.Subpart C of Part 19551. Section 1955.103 is expanded to include in the definition of ``Decent,Safe and Sanitary'' that properties must also be safe.2. As mentioned in the summary of changes in Subpart B, the terms ``suitable''and ``unsuitable'' as they relate to the housing inventory property havebeen changed to ``program'' and ``nonprogram'' (NP). Similarly, referencesto credit on ``eligible'' and ``ineligible'' terms, as they relate to housingproperty, have been changed to ``program'' and ``nonprogram'' (NP). Thedefinitions in andSection; 1955.103 have been revised and alphabetized accordingly,and references to the aforementioned terms have been revised throughoutSubpart C.3. Section 1955.104 is expanded to give the Administrator, and AssistantAdministrators, the authority to delegate any authority of said positionin this subpart to a State Director. The paragraph is revised to correctthe titles of employees under the jurisdiction of the Hawaii State Director;and clarify that servicing officials have the authority to offer for sale,and accept and/or reject bids or offers for inventory property regardlessof amount.4. Section 1955.111 is removed as it contained information regarding therepair policy on inventory property. Inventory property is repaired underSubpart B of this Part. Section 1955.110 is renumbered to andSection; 1955.111and andSection; 1955.111 is reserved for future use.5. Section 1955.112(a) is expanded to clarify that earnest money depositswill not be taken in connection with sales by FmHA personnel.6. Section 1955.112(b) is revised to: 1. Give the County Supervisor theauthority to utilize the services of real estate brokers under an openlisting agreement (previously, the authority was granted to the State Director);2. strongly encourage the use of exclusive brokers; 3. and clarify thatearnest money deposits are exclusive of any required credit report fee.7. Section 1955.112(c) is revised to encourage the use of sealed bids andauctions for SFH property when diligent sales efforts and adequate marketexposure fail to sell the property.8. Section 1955.113(a) is revised as provided in the proposed rule withthe following changes: 1. For ease in computing dates between administrativeprice reductions, each month is assumed to have 30 days; and 2. to providefurther guidance of sales steps after the two administrative price reductionshave been utilized and the property remains unsold.9. Section 1955.114(a), which outlines the sales steps for program property,is completely revised for clarity. Paragraph (a) was lengthy and cumbersomeand has been broken down into smaller segments. The paragraph has beenexpanded and clarified to: 1. Establish the new 45 day retention periodfor program applicants to purchase program properties; 2. clarify thatan acceptable offer must be for at least the sale price; 3. clarify thatan offer to purchase property is considered independently of any creditrequest; 4. require that offers be date stamped when received and be numberedsequentially when being drawn by lot; 5. establish a five-day waiting periodduring which offers can be received when the property is listed for saleunder an exclusive broker contract (this will allow all real estate brokersan equal chance of selling the property); 6. clarify the priority of offersprocess; 7. provide for back-up offers; 8. clarify that if an offer subjectto FmHA financing is accepted, and the offeror's credit request is laterdenied, the contract is considered null and void and the sale will continueto others regardless of whether the offeror decides to appeal the adversedecision as to their credit request; and 9. include a subparagraph on salessteps for unsold property.10. Section 1955.114(b) is expanded to provide further guidance on thehandling of offers to purchase Multiple-family housing inventory property.In particular, language is added on establishing a time/date/place forthe drawing when multiple offers are received and how to handle offerswhen the offeror's FmHA credit request is denied.11. Section 1955.115(a) is expanded to provide additional guidance on:1. Submitting requests to the State Director to sell nonprogram (NP) propertyby sealed bid or auction when the property remains unsold after two administrativeprice reductions; 2. additional guidance on sale on NP property as chattel;3. additional guidance on sale of vacant land; and 4. provide guidanceon steps to take when NP property remains unsold after five months of activemarketing.12. Section 1955.116 is revised as outlined in the proposed rule with thefollowing minor changes: 1. ``Decent, Safe and Sanitary (DSS)'' clausesused in advertising do not have to list the items which make the propertynot meet DSS standards, the advertisement will adivse any interested partyto contact the local office for the list, and 2. require that FmHA inspectthe property prior to releasing a restrictive covenant.13.

Provide additionalguidance on accepting, processing and approving offers to purchase inventoryproperty on NP terms; 2. provide additional guidance on modification ofsecurity instruments on loans to NP borrowers when certain covenants ofstandard FmHA security instruments do not apply; and 3. reduce the downpaymentrequirements as discussed in the proposed rule.14. Section 1955.130(a) is expanded to: 1. Encourage the use of exclusivereal estate brokers; 2. remove the reference to setting a commission ratein exclusive broker contracts since this rate will be part of the evaluationcriteria; and 3. remind field personnel that when utilizing the servicesof real estate brokers under an open listing agreement, the field officeis responsible for advertising.15. Section 1955.130(f) is revised and expanded to provide guidance that:1. FmHA may not set the commission rate in an exclusive broker contract;the commission will be one of the evaluation criteria; 2. when a real estatebroker submits a bid on an exclusive broker contract and the proposed commissionrate is lower than the typical rate for such services, they must supplydocumentation that they have successfully sold property at the lower ratewith no compromise in services; 3. commissions paid under an open listingagreement will be the typical rate for such services in the area and willbe established by the servicing official (the State Director previouslyestablished the rate); 4. incorporate the revision from our proposed rulethat a commission will be paid when the sale is to the broker and theyare not receiving FmHA credit for the purchase of the property. In thesecases where an exclusive broker is involved, if a sale is to a cooperatingbroker and they are receiving FmHA credit for the purchase, one-half therespective commission will be paid to the exclusive broker.16. Section 1955.131(b) is revised for consistency. As with other FmHAcontracts for sale services, FmHA may not set the commission rate in anauctioneer contract. The rate of commission will be one of the evaluationcriteria in the contract. However, any bidder that submits a bid with acommission rate lower than the typical rate for such services in the area,must supply documentation that they have successfully sold properties atthe lower commission rate with no compromise in services.17. Section 1955.135 is expanded and revised to clarify how FmHA will adjustand pay taxes when inventory property is sold.18. Section 1955.137 is expanded to include two new subparagraphs on advisingpotential purchasers of FmHA inventory properties with reportable undergroundstorage tanks and how to handle property (exclusive of buildings) whichis considered unsafe.19. Section 1955.141 is expanded to provide District Directors in PuertoRico with the authority to execute nonwarranty deeds for the sale of inventoryproperty. This authority currently lies with State Directors. In PuertoRico, the party executing the deed must be present at the time title tothe property is transferred. It is too burdensome and costly for the StateDirector in Puerto Rico to attend the closing of every inventory propertysale, therefore, this authority is delegated to a more local level.20. Section 1955.143 is expanded to provide additional guidance to fieldpersonnel on reporting inventory property that has not sold within a reasonableperiod of time to a higher level office for review and guidance.21. Section 1955.146 is expanded to provide more emphasis and guidanceon advertising inventory property for sale.22. Section 1955.147 is expanded to: 1. Provide guidance in determininga minimum sale price for a sealed bid sale; and 2. provide that when programor suitable property is sold by sealed bid that credit on program termswill be offered and that bid deposits will be comparable to an earnestmoney deposit instead of the ten percent bid deposit required from otherpurchasers.23. Section 1955.147(b) is revised as discussed in the proposed rule andto clarify that any FmHA credit extended may not exceed the market valueof the property nor may the term exceed the period for which the propertywill serve as adequate security.

Section 1955.148 is expanded and clarified to: 1. Provide guidanceon how to establish a minimum sale price; 2. clarify that any FmHA creditextended may not exceed the market value of the property nor may the termexceed the period for which the property will serve as adequate security;and 3. provide that, as addressed in the proposed rule, program applicantsreceive no preference in auction sales.Subpart E of Part 19011.

Revised references from ``eligible'' and ``ineligible'' rates/terms/applicantsto ``program'' and ``nonprogram (NP)'' rates, terms/applicants. Similarly,references to ``suitable'' and ``unsuitable'' properties are revised to``program'' and ``nonprogram (NP)'' properties.2. Section 1965.104(c) has been partially revised to authorize the StateDirector to approve protective advances for house maintenance when continuingwith the borrower. Previously, National Office review and consent was required,which could cause unnecessary delays in making a protective advance.3. Section 1965.106 has been expanded to: 1. Clarify that subordinationgranted to enable a borrower to graduate also includes refinancing withoutAgency request; and 2. provide the State Director with the authority toapprove subordinations regardless of the amount of indebtedness.4. Section 1965.125(a) has been partially revised to require County Supervisorsto inform borrowers of apparent equity in voluntary liquidation actions.Previously, this section required County Supervisors to inform borrowersof the amount of equity in the property. Without doing a full appraisal,and computing interest credit recapture based upon estimates of allowablesale expenses, which would be impractical, it is not possible for a CountySupervisor to provide a borrower with an accurate estimate of equity.5. Section 1965.126(b)(4)(ii) has been clarified. This paragraph providesguidance of determining the suitability of properties for retention inthe program when an assumption of the existing FmHA debt is being considered.6. Section 1965.126(b)(5) is expanded to clarify that ``as is'' marketvalues will be considered in assumption cases. 7. Section 1965.126(b)(13) is expanded to clarify that FmHA will not suggest,encourage or require a transferor to make repairs as a condition for approvinga transfer with assumption.8. Section 1965.126(c)(2) is expanded to clarify that in those specificcases where a same terms assumption is authorized, if the current interestrates/terms are more favorable to the assuming party, an assumption onnew terms may be accomplished provided the assuming party meets programeligibility requirements. Although the current regulation does not precludesuch an action, wording is being added to clarify this point.9. Paragraph 1965.126(d) is revised to exclude the requirement that toassume an existing FmHA loan on NP owner/occupant terms, the applicantmust be unable to secure other financing. Assumptions on NP terms are authorizedto assist borrowers with the sale of their property. Since this creditis extended at a higher interest rate and on shorter terms than those authorizedfor program applicants, there is no reason to carry over the program requirementof inability to secure other financing to NP applicants.10. Section 1965.127 is revised to remove: 1. The requirement for CountyCommittee certification in NP transfers; 2. the restriction that borrowerscannot be released from liability on NP transfers with a term in excessof five years; 3. the restriction that a jointly liable borrower cannotbe released from liability unless the value of the property is at leastequal to the debt; and 4. the requirement that repayment ability be consideredin sale for less than the debt cases.11.

If the indebtedness exceedsthe County Supervisor's loan approval authority, approval must be by anofficial with appropriate approval authority.(b) * * * (1) <T3>Loan classification and/or changes.</T3> A loan may be assumed as outlinedin this subparagraph, after which the loan will be classified accordingto the terms on which it was assumed. Assumption on program terms is authorizedONLY when both the assuming party meets eligibility requirements <T3>AND </T3>the property is suited for the housing program. The followingloans may be assumed on program or NP terms under paragraph (c) or (d)of this section:<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>(3) * * * It is not intended to exclude a property currently in the programfrom being transferred to a program applicant simply because it is situatedon more than a minimum-adequate site. * * * When the balance of the transferor'sdebt is paid or when only a portion of the security property was transferredwhich adequately secures the debt assumed by the transferee, and it isnecessary to release the remaining portion of the security property, OGCwill be requested to prepare the release document.(4) * * *(i) A single-family dwelling presently financed by FmHA may be transferredto a program applicant on program terms provided it meets FmHA programrequirements and policies. These properties are not being brought intothe RH program in the same sense as existing properties not already financedby FmHA. They are properties in which FmHA already has a long-term lendingcommitment and security interest. Therefore, such properties may be retainedin the program although they contain more square feet of living area and/ordesign features which would not be permitted when making an initial loanfor an existing dwelling according to Subpart A of Part 1944 of this chapter.It must, however, be typical of modest homes in the area.(ii) In some instances, a property presently financed under the section502 RH program may not be suited for retention in the program. In thoseinstances, assumption may be on NP terms only, according to paragraph (d)of this section. Situations of this type include, but are not limited to:(A) A dwelling which has been enlarged or improved to the point where itis clearly above modest in size, design and/or cost.(B) When a determination is made that the property should not have beenfinanced originally.(C) A dwelling brought into the program as an existing dwelling which metprogram standards at the time it was originally financed by FmHA but whichdoes not conform to current policies. This includes older and/or largerhouses of a type that have been proven to create excessive energy and/ormaintenance costs to very-low and low-income borrowers.(D) A dwelling which is obsolete due to location, design, constructionor age.(5) <T3>Amount of assumption.</T3> Except for transfers covered in paragraphs(b)(12) and (c)(2) of this section, the transferee will assume the entireFmHA indebtedness unless the indebtedness plus prior liens exceeds the``as-is'' market value of the property, in which case the transferee willassume an amount equal to the ``as-is'' market value of the property, lessthe amount of prior liens, if any. In the situations outlined in paragraphs(b)(12) and (c)(2) of this section, the amount of the debt will not bechanged. When the buyer and seller have agreed upon transfer for ``amountof debt,'' recapture of subsidy due based on ``as-is'' market value ofthe security property must be calculated and included as part of the totalindebtedness.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>(13) <T3>Repairs.</T3> When a loan is to be assumed on program terms, repairsnecessary to bring the property to program standards will be accomplishedwith a subsequent loan in accordance with Subpart A of Part 1944 of thischapter, unless the transferee has sufficient funds to make the repairswith his/her own resources. In no case will FmHA suggest, encourage, orrequire that the transferor make necessary repairs as a condition for approvinga transfer with assumption.(c) <T3>Assumption on program terms.</T3> A loan may be assumed on programterms when the transferee meets eligibility requirements in the loan makingregulation for the type loan involved, except that a section 504 transfereemay have only an ownership interest in the property and must occupy thedwelling as his/her residence after the assumption is closed.

Same terms assumptions under this paragraphare authorized without considering the assuming party's eligibility forprogram assistance. The interest rate, final due date, payment date, accountstatus (current, delinquent, ahead of schedule) will not be changed byvirtue of the assumption. After assumption, compliance with loan conditionsis required. If a same terms transfer is consummated and the account isdelinquent, it may be reamortized in accordance with andSection; 1951.314(a)(7)of Subpart G of Part 1951 of this chapter. Eligibility for interest creditwill be considered or re-evaluated at the time of assumption. Situationswhere these terms are authorized are:<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>(d) <T3>Assumption on NP terms. </T3>When a borrower sells or proposes to sellsecurity property and the purchaser does not meet the eligibility requirementsfor an RH loan, or the property is not suited for retention in the housingprogram, the debt may be assumed on NP terms if the assuming party hasrepayment ability, is creditworthy, and it is advantageous to the Governmentto allow the assumption. If the purchaser does not assume the debt, theloan must be liquidated. After assumption on NP terms, the loan will beclassified as a NP loan. The assumption agreement will bear interest atthe SFH-NP rate in effect on the date the assumption is approved. The termof the assumption may not exceed the period for which the property willserve as adequate security for the debt. Other terms are as follows:(1) When the purchaser does not own an adequate home and intends to occupythe house, the terms may be for a period not to exceed 30 years. A paymentof two percent of the debt (including any subsidy due) or the current ``as-is''market value of the property, whichever is lower, must be made at closingto reduce the amount assumed.(2) When the purchaser does not meet the criteria in paragraph (d)(1) ofthis section, the amortization period will not be for more than 10 yearsunless the State Director determines that more favorable terms are necessaryto facilitate the sale, in which case the assumption may be amortized usingup to a 20-year factor with payment in full (balloon payment) due not laterthan 10 years from the date of closing. A payment of five percent of thedebt (including any subsidy due) or the current ``as-is'' market valueof the property, whichever is lower, must be made at closing to reducethe amount assumed.(e) * * *(4) * * *(ii) Flood insurance is required on any house located in an identifiedflood or mudslide hazard area where flood insurance is available. If thehouse was built prior to implementation of the flood insurance programand flood insurance has never been available or is no longer available,assumption on program or NP terms may be approved without flood insuranceprovided the house is determined by the County Supervisor to be made (thatis, any hazard that exists would not likely endanger the safety of dwellingoccupants.) If not safe, or if water rises inside the living space of thehouse frequently, the property will be classified as NP and therefore subjectto assumption on NP terms only. If the house is located in an identifiedflood or mudslide hazard area and flood insurance is not available whenthe assumption is approved, the County Supervisor will note in the appropriatespace on Form FmHA 1940-1 that approval is subject to the requirement forhaving flood insurance if it becomes available in the future.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>49.
