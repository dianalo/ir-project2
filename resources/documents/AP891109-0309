Traders showed little enthusiasm over government statistics oninflation that most analysts described as favorable.   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen morethan 41 points Tuesday and Wednesday, dropped 19.67 to 2,603.69.   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 6 to 5 innationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with660 up, 815 down and 487 unchanged.   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 143.39 millionshares, down from 170.15 million in the previous session.Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, includingtrades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in theover-the-counter market, totaled 172.02 million shares.   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index offinished goods rose 0.4 percent in October, a bit more than hadbeen expected.   Excluding food and energy prices that are subject to largefluctuations from month to month, however, the increase was 0.1percent.   Analysts said those figures provided fresh support for hopesthat inflationary pressures would remain subdued enough to keepinterest rates from rising significantly and allow for continuedeconomic growth.   The Federal Reserve seemed to signal in advance its favorableview of the inflation outlook with a move this week to relax itscredit policy slightly.   Still, analysts said stock traders seemed preoccupied withworries about recent weakness in corporate earnings.   Energy stocks, for example, were mostly lower as RoyalDutch-Shell Group and British Petroleum posted lower profits forthe third quarter.   Royal Dutch Petroleum shares dropped 1} to 64|; Shell Transport| to 40\, and BP | to 57\.   Among other international oils, Exxon was down ~ at 45[; Chevron1{ at 61{; Mobil ~ to 55}, and Amoco ] at 47~.   Elsewhere, Consolidated Freightways fell 2} to 27|. The companysaid its results for the fourth quarter would be around thebreak-even point, or possibly a loss.   One exception to the overall trend was Walt Disney, up 1| at124{ on higher quarterly earnings.   Losers among the blue-chip industrials included Procter andamp;Gamble, down 2{ at 126|; Coca-Cola, down } at 73}; AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph, down | at 43|; General Electric, down \ at54\, and International Paper, down { at 47[.
