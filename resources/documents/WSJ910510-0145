At Pact Group, Patrick Litre and Cyril Balas have seen a$5,000 investment blossom into annual sales of $5.5 millionin less than four years. The two Frenchmen, both now 28 yearsold, started Pact Group in 1987 to provide custom businesssoftware for overseas clients, which have included LufthansaGerman Airlines, French car maker Renault and Du Pont Co.</LP><TEXT>   Equidata Philippines Inc., another computer-servicescompany, says it doubled its client list last year and didabout $1 million of business. James P. Conway, an Americanwho founded Equidata in 1985, hopes to double business againthis year and just opened a European office to bid for thehuge contracts to computerize records of eastern Germany.   The two companies are among several dozen in thePhilippines profiting from a surge in demand for offshorecomputer services. The jobs -- whether simple data input ordevelopment of sophisticated software -- have grown toocostly for many Western companies to do in-house. Andadvances in telecommunications have made it easier to farmout the work abroad. Also, software innovations have expandedthe range of services Philippine operations can provide.   The key to the companies' success is labor that is bothinexpensive and skilled: High-quality Philippine computertechnicians make about a sixth of what their Europeancounterparts earn.   At Equidata, most of the 138 data-entry workers arecollege graduates. For the equivalent of about $150 a monthplus free medical care -- and 12 kilograms of free rice forperfect monthly attendance -- they sit at computer terminalstyping a minimum of 10,000 characters an hour.   Registered exports of custom software and data bases havemore than doubled every year since 1986, to about $18 millionin 1990, Philippine government figures show. Industryinsiders estimate that custom-software exports alone were asmuch as $36 million last year.   Data input, the labor-intensive process of typing millionsof words and numbers into computers to create data bases,generated about $14 million in exports last year, up fromslightly more than $1 million in 1987, according to industryestimates.   Although the numbers are still a fraction of the worldcomputer-services market, the industry's growth is remarkablewhen set against the background of the Philippines generallypoor economic performance. Twenty-two new companies haveentered the custom-software export business in the past fiveyears, while the number of data-input companies has increasedto 17 from three in 1986.   The Philippines isn't the only developing countryjockeying for a piece of this business. But Mr. Litre of PactGroup and others think the country has several advantagesbecause of its low wages, comparatively high educationlevels, and a large pool of readily trainable technicians whoalready speak English, the language of computing. Rivals comefrom India and the Caribbean, but the Philippines is thoughtto have better quality control.   Mr. Litre of Pact Group says he first realized thepotential for offshore computing in the Philippines during a1985 visit to assist in software development for the localoffices of his employer, a French concern. &quot;I was using someof the computer professionals, and I found that they werevery good,&quot; he says. &quot;I realized that it would be verycost-effective to build information systems here.&quot; During thenext two years, he and Mr. Balas worked as computerconsultants in Europe, building contacts with companies thatbecame clients for a custom-software factory in thePhilippines.   Pact Group now is expanding its marketing efforts with$900,000 from the sale of 8% of its operations in February tothe San Francisco venture capitalists Hambrecht andamp; Quist Inc.Target markets include Indonesia and Taiwan, wherecomputerization of banks and airlines requires new software,and Hong Kong, where the emigration of computer professionalsis forcing companies to subcontract more work. Pact Groupalso is targeting Singapore and Australia.   The success of Pact Group and other software-developmentconcerns in the Philippines eventually could play a part inreducing their edge. &quot;Cost advantage in the Philippines istemporary,&quot; Mr. Litre says. &quot;We can use it as a lever now toget market share, but if the country develops properly, as wehope it will, we cannot be competitive on labor alone.&quot;   Companies already have difficulty keeping trainedtechnicians. SGV Group, the country's oldest and biggestcomputer-services concern, routinely trains more workers thanit needs to make up for anticipated defections.   &quot;We need certain types of skills to be competitive in acomputing environment based on big mainframes,&quot; says BaltazarN. Endriga, a partner with SGV Consulting, the company'ssoftware-export divison. &quot;But people with that type ofexperience are not in great abundance and are easilypirated.&quot;   Mr. Conway of Equidata concedes that turnover is high, asemployees gain experience and move on to better jobs. &quot;It ishard work to sit there all day putting things into amachine,&quot; he says. Legal documents are an increasinglyimportant part of Equidata's business. Other jobs includetelephone directories, map coding, and computerized addresslists.   Another problem is the image of the Philippines as alow-cost, low-tech manufacturing environment suitable forhandicrafts and garments, and perhaps low-end electronics,but not software.   &quot;We have everything -- the communication, the people, thework ethic, the English -- but we don't have the image,&quot; saysEdgar H. Sarte, who worked for International BusinessMachines Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. in the Philippines beforestarting his own computer-services company in 1978. &quot;If youtry to market in the U.S. against Singapore, Singapore willwin.&quot;   Still, the Philippine software-development consortium thatMr. Sarte heads, Software Technologies andamp; Associates, just wona $5.8 million contract to reconfigure the entire corporatesoftware package of more than 7,000 programs used by SidmarN.V., a Belgian steelmaker.   Sidmar was so pleased with the work, that it joined withTelinfo N.V., a Belgian telecommunications company, to marketPhilippine software-development services in Europe. Every bigEuropean company has the problem of a computer-technologypatchwork created over time, says Sidmar President Norbertvon Kunitzki.   The grandfather of Philippine data-entry companies isSaztec Philippines Inc., founded in the early 1970s by NewZealander Alan R. Fraser. The company recently doubled itsstaff, to nearly 2,000, and moved to a new building near theManila airport. For the year ending in June, the companyexpects net income of $1.5 million on revenue of $6.4million.   &quot;It's not sexy like hardware,&quot; says Gerardo Borromeo,executive vice president slated to succeed Mr. Fraser laterthis year, of the data-input industry, &quot;but without thedigital data, all you've got is a black box.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
