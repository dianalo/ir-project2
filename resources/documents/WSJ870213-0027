Norman Augustine, chairman of the task force, said such massive infusions of research funds are needed to reverse a decline in the U.S. semiconductor industry's sales and to help it regain technological advantages over foreign competitors.    U.S. manufacturers -- which once supplied almost all memory chips sold world-wide -- currently represent only 20% of the market and are still losing ground to Japanese competitors, Mr. Augustine said.    A Pentagon spokesman acknowledged that the U.S. industry's plight and the Pentagon's increasing dependence on foreign-made microchips are &quot;serious problems.&quot; Microchips are used in highly sophisticated weapons systems.    A report issued by the task force urged an initial capitalization of $250 million for the consortium. The recommended annual Pentagon awards are four times more than what the department normally allots for semiconductor research. But the task force said the increasing importance of electronic components in major weapons systems justifies such outlays. For example, electronic components represent 20% or more of the value of some jet fighters.    U.S. industry spokesmen were encouraged by the report. Andrew Processini, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said the proposed collaboration could help keep the industry &quot;at the cutting edge of both technology and manufacturing capability.&quot;    Mr. Augustine said that the Japanese industry invests twice as much in plant and equipment as its U.S. counterpart. Even some advanced U.S. technology products -- such as Cray Research Inc.'s supercomputers -- are constructed mostly out of Japanese-made chips, he said.    The task force's recommendations probably would require waiving antitrust rules to allow the formation of a U.S. consortium, and to allow it to absorb Pentagon awards on a noncompetitive basis.    The task force was established by the Defense Science Board, a Pentagon advisory panel that reviews the Defense Department's technology requirements. The task force includes 12 representatives from government, business and academia.    The task force's proposal is a throwback to the 1950s and 1960s, when Defense Department research-and-development funds helped launch the fledgling U.S. semiconductor industry.    Early Pentagon funding provided companies such as Texas Instruments Inc. with the incentive to develop the high-density chips that made the computer revolution possible.    &quot;U.S. superiority in the application of innovation no longer exists and the relative stature of our technology base in this area is steadily deteriorating,&quot; the group said.    The task force noted that &quot;U.S. military forces depend heavily on technological superiority to win,&quot; and warned that &quot;U.S. defense will soon depend on foreign sources for state-of-the-art technology in semiconductors. The task force views this as an unacceptable situation.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
