Morgan remained in jail, awaiting action on a weekend requestfiled by her lawyers that she be freed.   In a brief filed with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals,lawyers for Morgan's former husband, Dr. Eric Foretich, claim thelegislation, which President Bush signed Saturday, infringed on thepowers of the local courts.   The attorney, Elaine Mittleman, also said the bill violatedForetich's rights and those of the couple's daughter, Hilary, 7.   The Justice Department also expressed reservations to PresidentBush that the law might be an unconstitutional intrusion byCongress on the powers of the judicial branch to enforce itsorders, according to a department source who declined to beidentified.   David Runkel, chief spokesman for Attorney General DickThornburgh, refused to say what kind of advice the department hadgiven Bush before he signed the measure.   Morgan has been in jail rather than produce the child for acourt-ordered visit with Foretich, claiming he had sexually abusedHilary. Foretich denies the allegation.   The child remains in an undisclosed location.   ``We have not heard anything on how the court will handle it,''said Morgan attorney Adrian Roe. ``It's really in the court'shands.''   ``We're hopeful the court will act promptly, but we have noguarantees,'' Roe said.   Ms. Mittleman said the court could order a hearing on the caseand that there was no guarantee that the court would immediatelyissue an order freeing Morgan.   A three-judge panel heard arguments in the case last year, andthe full court held a rehearing last Wednesday.   Foretich and Ms. Mittleman both stressed that the bill does notrequire Ms. Morgan to produce the girl.   Foretich said he would be ``delighted'' to have his former wifereleased, if the federal government helped him find their daughter.   ``But until they're willing to do that, I don't see where I haveany choice but to concern myself with the violation of my rightsand those of my daughter,'' he added.   D.C. Corrections Department spokeswoman Patricia Wheeler saidjail officials required a court order to release Morgan.   Ms. Mittleman said Foretich has asked Bush to direct theattorney general to either appoint a special prosecutor or tell theFBI to help find the child.   Foretich has offered a $5,000 reward to anyone who could provideinformation on Hilary's whereabouts.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush signed thebill ``out of compassion for her plight'' after members ofCongress, also concerned about her case, passed legislation to freeMorgan.   The measure signed by Bush, which will be applied retroactivelyto Morgan's case, sets a one-year limit on civil contempt jailingsin child custody cases in the District of Columbia. The law is toexpire after 18 months.</TEXT></DOC>
