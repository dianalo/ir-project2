(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Fancy bridge workandM;Spreadsheet users have recently been getting used to what would once havebeen thought a great luxury: the ability of one package to read and work onthe files of another.andP;  Indeed, it's becoming necessary not to be justIBM-compatible, but 1-2-3-compatible as well.andM;Word processor users haven't been so lucky.andP;  It's a common complaint thatsomebody who writes files using, say, WordStar won't be able to send copiesto a colleague who uses PFS:Write.andP;  This is where Software Bridge comes in,translating files from one format to another with minimal loss of features.andM;The program is supplied on five disks, containing a number of system filesand an .EXE file for each of the software packages it supports.andP;  This is afairly extensive list, including the latest versions of Microsoft Word,PFS:Write, WordPerfect and WordStar.andP;  There are some exceptions, such asManuscript, TopCopy and the increasingly popular Qandamp;A.andM;Installation isn't difficult, but will be a nuisance to people who areapplications users rather than PC users.andP;  You have to make a directory onyour hard disk, copy the whole of disk 1 into it and then copy some of disk2.andP;  This sets up the shell of the system and takes up 0.5Mb.andP;  You need tofind the particular .EXE files that correspond with the packages that you'reusing and copy them over individually.andP;  There are no clues about where theyare; you just have to find and copy them one by one.andP;  I know that thisdoesn't sound too onerous, but there should really have been an Installprogram to take care of it.andM;If your favourite package isn't in the supported list, you may be able to getyour word processor to read another system's file which is supported.andP;  Thismight be messy, but I did manage to persuade Qandamp;A to read files that I wroteusing WordStar and Smart, and then translated to PFS:Write format.andP;  But Ifailed to get it to work the other way round.andM;Other translations worked quite well, though.andP;  WordStar to Smart and Smart toQandamp;A worked perfectly.andP;  Smart to WordStar included a lot of unnecessary dotcommands which hung my whole system the first time I tried to print, butafter taking them out it was fine.andP;  WordStar to Qandamp;A was good, except that itprinted italics as plain text.andM;I also set myself another problem.andP;  I tried creating a file in WordStar,translating it to Smart, then from Smart to PFS:Write, then back again toWordStar.andP;  The first two stages worked, but the final stage went somewhatscrewy, and I ended up with a file full of garbage.andP;  All this was donewithout using any of the word processors on the file at any interim stage: itwas a matter of straight consecutive translations.andM;It isn't possible to get everything successfully from one package to another,since each package supports a different range of features.andP;  Software Bridgecopes with about as much as you could expect, performing each translation intwo stages: firstly to its own internal format, and then to the desiredexternal format.andP;  Under the circumstances, it does remarkably well.andM;Once installed, using the system couldn't be much simpler.andP;  A menu asks youif you want to translate from package A to package B or vice versa, or tochange the software parameters.andP;  If you want to change, you're given a listof all the other packages supported, whether or not you've installed them;having found the one you want, you press either the left or right cursor keyto say whether you want this to be the format to translate from or to.andP;  Ifyou don't know which software was used to produce a file, you can choose toauto-translate.andP;  Software Bridge will then look at the file you've got andtry to work out what format it's in.andP;  If it doesn't know, it won't try totranslate it.andM;Having chosen your formats, you list the files you want to translate.andP;  Thesystem will help find them for you, if you want it to; then off you go.andP;  Upto 250 documents can be done in a single session.andP;  Each translation is storedin the current sub-directory, with its original name but with an extensionthat indicates its new format (.SMT for Smart, for example).andM;It isn't surprising that with the piecemeal growth of PC-based wordprocessing, a lot of packages were developed with different standards; itwould be nice, though, if the software developers could get together tohammer out a common format.andM;In the meantime, this is a useful tool for people who work in an environmentwhere there's many different standards.andP;  But before you buy, it would be aswell to check that the options cover all the packages you have in mind.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
