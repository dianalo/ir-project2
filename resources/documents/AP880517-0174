Reagan said he had ``complete confidence'' in Meese, whoseJustice Department has been rocked by unrest and resignations andwho is the target of criminal investigations of his affairs.   At a brief news conference, the president also said, ``I don'tguide my life'' by astrology but he did not disavow believing in it.   Reagan said no changes were ever made in his schedule because ofastrological forecasts, as former White House chief of staff DonaldT. Regan has claimed.   ``We made no decisions on it and we're not binding our lives tothis,'' Reagan said. ``And I don't mean to offend anyone who doesbelieve in it, or engages in it seriously,'' Regan added.   Asked if he believed in astrology, Reagan paused a long moment,and said, ``I don't guide my life by it, but I won't answer thequestion the other way because I don't know enough about it to say,is there something to it.''   Questions about Noriega and Meese dominated the nationallybroadcast question-and-answer session in the White House briefingroom. It was his most extensive meeting with the press since a newsconference Feb. 24.   There have been numerous reports that Reagan has offered to dropdrug-trafficking charges against Noriega if he would leave Panamaat least until after elections are held.   ``We are in the midst of real negotiations. I can't commentfurther on this,'' Reagan said. Repeatedly, he said he would notreveal what the United States was offering Noriega while thenegotiations were continuing, but promised to make ``a fullstatement'' to the public ``at the appropriate time.''   However, Reagan said much of what has been written about thenegotiations had been ``based on some kind of leaks ormisinformation, because there are no facts to sustain it.''   In refusing to discuss the negotiations, Reagan said, ``It wouldbe foolish to do so. Some things you have to keep to yourself whenyou're arguing with someone else. ...   ``There has been no decision made on some of the things that arebeing discussed,'' he added.   ``You're asking me to lead into what's being talked about and Ican only tell you that we're not going to whitewash anyone,'' hesaid.   Reagan also defended the administration against allegations thatit knew long ago that Noriega was involved in drug trafficking, butchose to look the other way.   ``There had been some rumors ... but no one ever received orcould get evidence to substantiate those rumors,'' the presidentsaid.   The president gave a warm endorsement of Meese, his friend ofmore than 20 years who is under increasing pressure to resign.   ``I have complete confidence in him,'' Reagan said.   He said there has been a recent practice ``in which accusationor allegation is taken to mean conviction, and there's been toomuch of that. In this land of ours, you are innocent until you areproven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.''   Embracing Meese's rationale for remaining on the job, Reagansaid, ``I think that for him to step aside, as he has said, wouldbe for him to live the rest of his life under this cloud, wherenothing had ever been proved.''   He raised questions about Meese's firing of Terry Eastland, theJustice Department spokesman who has been defended byconservatives. The president said there may be ``more than meetsthe eye.'' He refused to elaborate, telling reporters they should``talk to the attorney general about that.''   Reagan opened his news conference with a statement hailing theagreement to start Senate debate on the U.S.-Sovietintermediate-range arms treaty and the March trade figures, whichshowed a dramatic drop in the monthly deficit in the balance ofexports and imports.   He said the $4.1 billion drop in the trade deficit was ``goodnews, the best news on this front since March of 1985.''   He cited the figures as evidence that restrictive tradelegislation recently passed by the Democratic-controlled Congresswas not needed. He said he expected to veto the bill and send thatmessage to Congress in the next few days.</TEXT></DOC>
