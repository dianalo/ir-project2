At a summit windup news conference, the president avoided anydirect criticism of his host, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev,and said Kremlin officials believe that raising questions aboutemigration constituted ``interfering'' in internal matters.   Reagan also held out hope that an agreement on sharp slashes inthe superpowers' nuclear arsenals still could be achieved before heleaves office but said he he was dead set against deadlines.   But his comments on arms control were overshadowed by hissuggestion that Soviet leaders should not be personally blamed forthe restrictions which put Soviet citizens in labor camps and keepthousands of Jews and other Russians from leaving.   ``I just have to believe that in any government some of us dofind ourselves bound in by bureaucracy,'' Reagan said.   He said in such instances a leader must stomp his feet anddemand that wrongs be set right and he suggested he thoughtGorbachev was doing that.   ``I have great confidence in his ability to do that,'' Reagansaid, noting that Gorbachev has been responsive when Reagan gavehim lists of hardship cases.   The president was asked by an American reporter whether he felthe was ``letting Mr. Gorbachev off a little easy on just sayingit's bureaucracy'' that bars Russians from leaving.   The question grew out of Reagan's reply to a student at MoscowState University on Tuesday about dissidents and refuseniks, thosewho have been denied visas and often lose their jobs or areotherwise punished merely for seeking permission to leave.   ``I'm not blaming you; I'm blaming bureaucracy,'' Reagan toldthe student. ``We have the same type of thing happen in ourcountry...''   On other issues, Reagan:   _Expressed optimism that the United States and Soviet Unioncould come to terms on a treaty to reduce their arsenals ofstrategic nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent.   ``The conversation are still going on and they are still beingdiscussed and I say progress is still being made or we wouldn't betalking as we are,'' he said.   _Refused to commit himself to a fifth summit with Gorbachev, butdid not rule out the possibility of one, even without a STARTagreement to sign.   _Said he and Gorbachev have a ``very satisfactory relationshipbut at the same time I am never going to relax my belief in theneed for verification of agreements that we might make.''   _Maintained that his disavowal of his earlier characterizationof the Soviet Union as an ``evil empire'' results from changesinstituted by Gorbachev.   ``I read Perestroika and I found much in it that I agreedwith,'' Reagan said. ``Perestroika,'' meaning restructuring, is thetitle of a book by Gorbachev.   But it was his remark about Soviet bureaucracy that raised themost pointed question.   ``In this room on Monday,'' the reporter said, ``you heardmoving stories of people who had been in prison, dissidents,religious people, and then you went to Moscow State University andthen you wrote it off to bureacuracy. Is that really your view thatit is only the bureaucracy, it is not a willful policy of thegovernment here to keep these people from emigrating?''   In response, Reagan said the the question had been ``presentedto me on the basis that it possibly was a bureaucratic bungle.''   Actually, the student's question had been why had Reagan invitedonly refuseniks and dissidents to meet with him the previous day.   Throughout the summit, the president has soft-pedaled hiscustomary attacks of the communist system.   He was reminded that at his first news conference in the WhiteHouse in 1981 he said that Communist leaders are willing to lie andcheat in pursuit of world domination.   Asked if that was still his view, he said in 1981 he had merelybeen quoting what Communist leaders themselves had said. Using theRussian words, he said with a smile, that his policy remains:``trust, but verify.''   He said he has found Gorbachev ``different than previous Sovietleaders'' and that ``we can look with optimism to futurenegotiations'' to reduce strategic arms.   Reagan met with reporters shortly after Gorbachev, at the firstnews conference he had ever held in the Soviet Union, noted withpleasure that Reagan had retracted his characterization of thiscountry as an ``evil empire.''   Reagan said Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders ``have had afeeling that in some way'' American concern with human rightsconditions in the Soviet Union constitute ``interfering in yourinteral government policies.''   Asked about prospects from agreement on START in his term, hesaid, ``I honestly cannot answer that, I don't know.''   He said negotiators are continuing working in Geneva on thedifficult issues involved, but ``There is no way that I would givethem a date (for completion)... because that is not the wqay to geta good treaty.''</TEXT></DOC>
