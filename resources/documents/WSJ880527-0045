Amax said it also agreed to receive the acquired properties' revenue and pay their expenses back to Jan. 1. The acquisition includes interests in about 900 wells, four gas plants and a gathering system, mainly in Mississippi, Louisiana, the Texas Gulf Coast, West Texas, southeast New Mexico and Oklahoma, plus 131,000 acres of undeveloped leases and inventory of the two Kaneb companies.    Amax is a mineral and energy company. Kaneb Services Inc., Dallas, owns 82% of the units of Kaneb Energy Partners. Kaneb Operating is a unit of Kaneb Energy Partners.    Meanwhile, Sonat Inc., Birmingham, Ala., said it agreed to pay $68 million to acquire Kaneb Energy Partners' 50% interest in a methane project and to &quot;resolve certain contractual disputes&quot; with Dallas-based Kaneb Energy.    Sonat, an energy company, didn't say what the disputes were, and company officials couldn't be reached for comment. The methane project is the Brookwood coal-seam methane-gas project, between Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Birmingham.    Separately, Kaneb Services said holders of its Class A preferred stock, failed to elect two directors to the company's board when the annual meeting resumed Tuesday because &quot;there are questions as to the validity of the proxies submitted by the group.&quot;    The company adjourned its annual meeting May 12 to allow time for review of the proxies submitted by preferred holders. The group said it was entitled to elect two directors because the company failed to pay the equivalent of six quarterly dividend payments on the Class A shares. </TEXT></DOC>
