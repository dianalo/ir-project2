The former White House aide said he felt he was tabbed by Reaganadministration officials to be the fall guy in the affair when heheard himself described at a White House news conference inNovember 1986 as ``the only one who knew what was going on.''   He also said he told the truth to then-Attorney General EdwinMeese III, who had been assigned by President Reagan to conduct aninquiry into the sale of arms to Iran. Meese's aides uncovered thediversion of proceeds to the Contra during the inquiry.   North's defense case was concluded shortly after he left thewitness stand. U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said he hopedfinal arguments would begin on Monday.   North was questioned closely during the day over details of thegovernment's charges against him.   He testified that he used catalog store typewriters to writeback-dated letters claiming that he had offered to pay for a$13,800 home security system that he had actually had accepted freeof charge.   On his sixth and final day of testimony at his trial, North saidhe typed the letters in December 1986 after he had been fired fromthe National Security Council staff because of the Iran-Contraaffair.   Still in the Marine Corps after being dismissed from the NSC,North said he didn't want to type the backdated letters at workbecause he didn't want the Marines involved in ``that type ofcoverup.''   Now accused of accepting an illegal gratuity, North said he wentto a catalog outlet on two occasions, using typewriters there tocreate two backdated letters. The documents were a phony offer topay by saying the system was on loan until North left thegovernment and that the installer could use his home as a promotionfor his business.   North had accepted the security system in mid-1986 from retiredAir Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, who North had enlisted tosecretly run arms to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.   North also testified that he assumed a coverup was in place whenMeese announced on Nov. 25, 1986 that North was the pivotal figurein diverting money to the Contras.   Ending four days of grueling cross-examination, North said Meesegave reporters details of the arms shipments and diversion thatwere ``inconsistent with what I had told the attorney general twodays before.''   At the news conference, Meese said North's boss, then-nationalsecurity adviser John Poindexter, had known of the diversion buthadn't approved it.   In fact, Poindexter has said he approved the diversion.   ``This was part of pointing the finger at Ollie North'' as acoverup and that ``is the way it was supposed to be,'' the formerNSC aide testified. President Reagan announced North's firing fromthe White House staff at the news conference.   North denied that he lied to Meese's aides as the Iran-Contraaffair was unfolding, saying that ``by golly, when they raised''the diversion of money to the Nicaraguan rebels ``I told them aboutit.''   North said he was unable to recall many details of the Nov. 23,1986 interview, which is memorialized only in handwritten notestaken by a Justice Department lawyer.   ``This was a four-hour meeting with 29 pages of very crypticnotes,'' said North, who is accused of obstructing the inquiry byMeese and making false statements.   North is charged with lying by allegedly omitting any mention ofSecord's role in the diversion of the Iranian arms sales proceedsto the Contras at a time when Congress banned aid to the rebels.   Meese and his aides said North told them that the NationalSecurity Council had no involvement in the diversion and thatIsrael determined how much would be diverted.   In the interview with Meese, North also said he told Contraleader Adolfo Calero to open bank accounts in Switzerland toreceive the money from Israel, according to the indictment.   North from the witness stand gave a different account of whattranspired in the Sunday afternoon meeting in Meese's office. Hesaid he told the attorney general that Israel subtractedoperational costs in the Iran weapons operation, thus determininghow much was left over and available for the Contras and otherprojects.   North said he told Meese the NSC was not involved in moving thediversion money through various accounts. He said he also told theattorney general that Swiss bank accounts to receive the diversionmoney had been set up by Secord.   The diversion of funds from the Iran arms sales to the Contraswas ``a secret within a secret'' and North did not bring it upuntil Meese handed him a memo outlining it, he said.   ``By golly when they raised it, I told them about it,'' Northtestified.</TEXT></DOC>
