Geothermal, which develops and operates geothermal power plants, said it obtained a loan of $96 million from Credit Suisse and raised $23 million more in a private placement of its Series B convertible preferred stock. The Credit Suisse loan is being made to GEO East Mesa L.P. The partnership, along with Mitsubishi International Corp. is managing Geothermal's development of the power-generation facility.    Southern California Edison Co. will buy electricity generated by the facility. Geothermal so far has invested $17 million in the project.    In addition, the company completed the purchase from Magma Power Co. of a geothermal plant in the same general area as the East Mesa project. Geothermal said it paid $13.1 million in cash and securities for the plant. Previously, Geothermal had paid Magma $2.2 million for an interest in the plant.    As part of the acquisition, Magma will receive 430,107 common shares of Geothermal, or about 8.4% of Geothermal's common shares outstanding.    Magma designs and manages the construction and operation of geothermal plants. </TEXT></DOC>
