Within the first hour of trading on the New York Stock ExchangeMonday, President Bush pointedly told reporters, ``I'm notworried.'' Behind the business-as-usual image, however, the sourcessaid, was a weekend of intentive private consultations intended toforestall an escalation of Friday's 190-point drop in the Dow JonesIndustrial Average.   The average ended Monday up 88.12 points.   Bush, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady and SEC Chairman Richard Breeden soughtover the weekend to work together to avoid the kind of governmentmissteps that may have contributed to the October 1987 crash, saidofficials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   Their actions included making sure that officials' comments notadd to the markets' confusion, as was the case two years ago withSEC comments suggesting the possiblity of a trading halt, said thesources.   After Monday's close, Breeden said, ``Today's developmentsdemonstrate the value of the significant improvements that havebeen made in trading systems over the past two years.''   Also after the close, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwatersaid: ``We're pleased it stabilized. ... Things have worked out.''   The strategy also called for close coordination with alliedgovernments whose own markets faced the possibility of disruptionsMonday and getting the word out that the Fed would pump money intothe nation's banking system to meet brokers' cash needs.   Brady, who chaired the presidential commission that studied the1987 crash and recommended ways of dealing with future marketplunges, was assigned the lead role for the administration over theweekend, said Fitzwater.   Bush, who spent the weekend in Camp David, Md., was givenupdates Saturday and Sunday by Brady and Michael Boskin, thechairman of the presidential Council of Economic Advisers,Fitzwater said.   A senior Treasury Department official, speaking on the conditionof anonymity, said there was ``constant communication'' over theweekend among Brady, Wall Street, the Fed, the SEC and the WhiteHouse.   In addition, ``we talked with officials'' in the United States'six largest economic allies _ Britain, Japan, France, West Germany,Canada and Italy _ in an effort to coordinate economic policies.   ``We wanted to make sure we understood the situation in themarkets, including the currency markets. And then we kept a closewatch when the (overseas) markets began to open last night,'' theTreasury official said.   Wall Street and administration officials credited bettercoordination among regulatory agencies and financial markets andsome of the so-called circuit-breaker mechanisms _ adopted on therecommendation of the Brady commission _ with helping to prevent arepeat of 1987's runaway Friday-Monday sell-offs.   Under the game plan jointly put into effect by the Treasury, theSEC and the Fed:   _The Fed made clear over the weekend that it would move to pumpcash into the banking system should it be necessary. On Monday, itdid this to the tune of $2 billion, in the process providing easiercredit to banks for overnight loans.   _While Treasury kept in constant touch with trading partners andU.S. agencies, administration officials publicly stressed theunderlying health of the U.S. economy.   _The SEC sent out teams to closely monitor activity on stock andoption exchanges, feeing the information back to headquarters.   Brady also made an unusual appearance at the White House Mondaymorning.   In addition to meeting with President Bush, the Treasurysecretary sat in on the daily meeting of senior White House aides _and, according to those present, urged that an upbeat face be puton the situation.   While there is a limit to what a president can do to influencethe stock market _ beyond rhetoric _ there is one drastic option hehas at his command: he can order a halt in trading.   Fitzwater would not say whether such an option was evenconsidered, not wanting to advance any speculation that could makethings worse.   In fact, it was a comment during the stock crash of 1987 bythen-SEC chairman David S. Ruder that ``anything was possible''regarding a possible trading halt that Brady cited in his report onthe crash for driving stock prices down even further.</TEXT></DOC>
