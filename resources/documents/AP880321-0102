The court said it will hear an appeal by phone customers inMinnesota who have accused Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. oftrying to bribe state public utility officials.   The phone subcribers sued the company under a law known as theRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).   They said the company beginning in 1980 tried illegally to winrate increases by offering gifts, employment offers, tickets tosporting and cultural events and other favors to members of theMinnesota Public Utilities Commission.   The suit was thrown out by a federal judge and that ruling wasupheld last September by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.   The appeals court said the phone users failed to allege acontinuing pattern of racketeering activity required to make a caseunder the RICO act.   ``A single fraudulent effort or scheme is insufficient'' groundsfor a suit, the appeals court said. It said the phone customers'``complaint alleges no more than a series of fraudulent actscommitted in furtherance of a single scheme to influence'' thepublic utility commissioners.   The Supreme Court is being asked to pick between varioustheories of how difficult it should be to maintain such a lawsuit.   The most expansive view would permit a RICO suit when there aretwo related acts ``in furtherance of a single episode or a scheme.''   A more restrictive view would be that a pattern of racketeeringactivity exists only when there are multiple separate criminalschemes or episodes.   Those suing Northwestern Bell said there also is a middle roadthat would permit such suits based on an analysis of variousfactors, including the number and variety of alleged illegal acts,the number of victims, the length of time of the activity and thenumber of participants in the alleged scheme.   They said the 8th Circuit court ruling conflicts with decisionby a number of other federal appeals courts.   The case is H.J. Inc. vs. Northwestern Bell, 87-1252.</TEXT></DOC>
