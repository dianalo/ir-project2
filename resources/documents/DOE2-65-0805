Ithas now achieved the point at which there remain no major technical barriersto its successful use. As collector costs are reduced, more and morephotovoltaic applications will become economical, with widespread utilitygeneration as the ultimate goal. This paper has attempted to convey thelevel of system technology maturity by discussing four of the most oftenasked questions regarding the technology. This discussion does not representthe total data available and should only be considered to be representativeof the depth to which issues have been investigated. The research intosystems technology is continuing today, with the focus more on user specificissues, and the reduction of the complex design techniques and guidelinesto more user friendly forms. The photovoltaic systems activity is activelyinvolved in an aggressive technology transfer program at this time, andhas set up a Design Assistance Center to aid in the effort. Through themeans of the Center, it is hoped that the existent technology base willreceive wider distribution, and the adoption of the technology will beaccelerated.</TEXT></DOC>
