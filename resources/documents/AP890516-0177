At least 1,193 guerrillas were killed since the Khost attackbegan Sunday, including 723 since Monday, Foreign Ministryspokesman Mohammad Amani said.   Amani said the armed forces responded with heavy artillery andair strikes to a frontal assault by 9,000 guerrillas and fireddozens of Scud-B missiles from bases in Kabul, the capital, about250 miles north of Khost.   Rebels fired seven rockets into Kabul on Tuesday, and one hit agate at a terminal at Kabul Airport, killing three people, Amanisaid. He said no other casualties resulted.   Rain and low cloud cover grounded Afghan warplanes, allowing theinsurgents hiding in the surrounding mountains to move closer toKabul, he said. Military transport and civilian flights werecanceled.   The guerrillas, armed by the United States, Saudi Arabia andChina and based in neighboring Pakistan, have tried for 11 years totopple the Soviet-backed government.   The rebels control much of the Afghan countryside, but not thecities. Capturing a city would give them a base for the interimgovernment they formed in Pakistan in February.   The guerrillas launched a major assault in early March onJalalabad, 45 miles from Pakistan. After surrendering several keyoutposts early in the attack, government troops beat back theguerrillas in a counterattack.   According to Amani, government forces began sweeping through thesouthwestern part of Jalalabad on Monday to clear out rebels. Hesaid 35 guerrillas were killed and 34 wounded. Eight civilians alsowere wounded.   Military officials have said 500 civilians were killed and 3,000wounded during the siege.   Amani said that having failed to capture Jalalabad, theguerrillas attacked Khost, about six miles from the Pakistan border.   ``They were expecting a quick victory in Jalalabad, but theyfound this was very difficult,'' the Foreign Ministry spokesmansaid. ``Now they have failed and given up and begun an attack onKhost.   ``Time and again, they have claimed to control much of thecountry, but they control no city. They were totally defeated inJalalabad and now they will be defeated in Khost.''   Unlike Jalalabad, Khost has no major airport ortelecommunications center, but contains one of the country'sstrongest military bases, Amani said.   About 80,000 people live in the Khost district, a majoragricultural center.   Amani said the main road between Kabul and Khost cuts throughrugged terrain and can be easily blocked.   He said insurgents staged hit and run attacks in northern Konduzprovince. Soldiers killed two rebels and wounded 28 withoutsuffering casualties, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
