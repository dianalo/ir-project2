No More Than Israel's Anti-Arab Policy   ----   By Alexander Cockburn</HL><DATE>05/24/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A15</SO><CO>   MDEST</CO><LP>   The place, beside the main road into Rishon Lezion, isknown locally as &quot;the slave market.&quot; It's where Palestinianlaborers wait in hope of getting a day's work in constructionor fruit picking from Israeli contractors. Here, last Sunday,21-year-old Ami Popper killed seven Palestinians and wounded10 with an automatic rifle.   The word from Israeli authorities was that Popper was&quot;deranged.&quot; It was suggested he may have been sexuallyassaulted by an Arab when he was 13. So if the assault storywas true, you could say in a way Palestinians brought it onthemselves. Mind you, if a Palestinian shot seven Jews, noone would bother with psychiatric discrimination. He'd be a&quot;terrorist&quot; and he'd stay a &quot;terrorist,&quot; even if it turnedout that at the age of 13 he'd seen his pregnant motherbeaten half to death by Israeli soldiers and his youngerbrother blinded by a rubber bullet.</LP><TEXT>   Not everyone bought the &quot;crazed killer&quot; theory. Two ofPopper's neighbors told Newsday he was &quot;a really nice kid&quot;and not mad at all. Refusing requests from Popper's lawyerand from the police that he be hospitalized for psychiatricobservation, Judge Davide Mualam remarked, &quot;Most of those whocommit serious crimes are emotionally stable, both legallyand medically.&quot;   With truly remarkable chutzpa, propagandists like StevenEmerson (who had a piece on this paper's editorial pageTuesday) claimed that Israel somehow emerged with enhancedmoral standing with &quot;values and conscience&quot; excellentlydemonstrated by the speed with which Popper's deed wascondemned by Israelis, including government leaders.   But what did Israelis leaders actually do after Popper'sspree? They ordered more savage repression. Headlines couchedthus, &quot;Lone Israeli Slays 7 Palestinians; 7 More Arabs Killedas Riots Erupt&quot; don't give us the active mathematics ofretaliation. The headline should have read, &quot;Popper kills 7Palestinians, Then Army Kills 7 More, Wounds 700.&quot;   The idea seems to be that Palestinians would feel betterabout the Popper killings if they understood that the gunmanwas nuts, rather than merely having a bad day or even feelinggreat. The trouble is, when you are continuously, month aftermonth, on the receiving end of rational, coolly calculatedviolence you probably don't stop to ask yourself, how willAmi Popper make out on his inkblot test? You go ahead andthrow a rock.   Here are a few instances of rationality as recentlyexperienced by Palestinians:   -- Last year, Rabbi Moshe Levinger, leader of the GushEmunim fanatics, fired indiscriminately at Palestinians inHebron after his car had been hit by stones. He killed ashopkeeper and was arrested. According to Israelihuman-rights activist Prof. Israel Shahak, &quot;Shortly before(the Popper) massacre the Israeli media extensively coveredstatements and events inciting Israeli Jews to kill Arabs.&quot;Rabbi Levinger, sentenced to five months for slaying thePalestinian shopkeeper, was honored at a celebration inElkana prior to entering prison by -- according to the May 18Ha'aretz, Israel's largest daily, Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai,military commander of the West Bank. Also present was ChaimHerzog, Israel's president.   After the event, Rabbi Levinger was taken to prison on theshoulders of his supporters. Earlier, Rabbi Moshe Neriyapublished a statement for this occasion, quoted in Ha'aretzfor May 13, in which the rabbi enjoined every Jew &quot;to shoot(Arabs) left and right without thinking and withouthesitating.&quot; According to Prof. Shahak, this statement wasscarcely condemned by politicians.   -- A former army commander, Lt. Col. Yehuda Meir, is nowbeing tried in military court, accused of systematicallybreaking the arms and legs of people in the West Bankvillages of Huwara and Beita. Col. Meir had been quietlyreleased by the army after the incidents, but protests fromsome Knesset members forced a trial. He is not being calledderanged. The persons so beaten were on a list and, as theperiodical Middle East International says, &quot;The court hasheard hair-raising accounts of the `operation' in whichvictims were hauled from their homes, showing no resistance;then, while shackled, their limbs were shattered with clubs.Senior officers testified that Meir's orders were in flagrantdefiance of official policy. Judicial observers do not expectMeir to receive anything more than a token sentence.&quot;   What do Palestinians see, as they peer about in search ofa rational world in which they could follow the tranquilcommand of the U.S. government and press to stay off thestreets and wait for the &quot;peace process&quot; to unfold?   Yitzhak Shamir is now seeking to cobble together analliance of the far right, which might even include asdefense minister his enemy Ariel Sharon, who pledges to endthe &quot;intifada&quot; quickly with &quot;no questions asked&quot; (i.e.Popperism writ large). Desirous of the police ministry isRehavam Ze'evi, a member of a party that seeks massdeportations of Palestinians. The present deputy foreignminister, Binyamin Netanyahu, also favors mass deportation.   At the moment Palestinians were protesting Popper'sslayings and Steven Emerson was formulating his column aboutIsraeli leaders' compassionate response, a committee of theKnesset was voting more than $17 million for road-buildingand Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. AJerusalem-based think tank, the Institute for AdvancedStrategic and Political Studies, recently issued a reportthat it claimed represented &quot;a wall-to-wall consensus ofIsrael's military and strategic communities.&quot; The Jewish Weekreports a prime conclusion of the report was that &quot;giving upterritory for an Arab state in the West Bank and/or Gaza is`unthinkable' for Israel,&quot; even if such a state was, as thereport's editor said, &quot;ruled by the Boy Scouts of America.&quot;   The report, called &quot;Can Israel Survive a PalestinianState?&quot; was launched at the National Press Club inWashington, and clearly aimed at an American audience. As ofMay 4 no Hebrew-language version had been put out.   In other words, it's clearly the consensus of Israel'spolitical elite that they can outstay any U.S. pressure --though none has been exerted -- to make any concessions toPalestinians. They can continue to crush the &quot;intifada&quot; andlook to the time when the so-called Palestinian &quot;demographictime-bomb&quot; will be countered by the arrival of Soviet Jews,estimated at one million by 1993. This will make Israel evenmore determined to hold on to the West Bank and its crucialwater supply.   For their part, &quot;moderate&quot; Palestinian leaders who went onhunger strikes after the Popper killings see that talking toU.S. officials is getting them nowhere.   There's no internal political pressure for these officialsto do anything serious. And so nothing serious has been done.Most U.S. politicians cower in terror at the American-Jewishlobby, even though public opinion is ahead of them. Israel'sleaders reckon they have nothing to fear from the U.S. asthey try to stamp out all Palestinian resistance.   Within the terms of Israel's policy toward Palestinians,Ami Popper perpetrated an entirely rational act.   ---   Mr. Cockburn is a columnist for The Nation and AndersonValley (Calif.)
