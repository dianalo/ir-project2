L. 100-689, the Veterans Benefits and Programs ImprovementAct of 1988, an amendment is made to andSection; 21.1043 to state that forthe purposes of extending the eligibility period for educational assistanceunder Chapter 34, Title 38, United States Code, based upon a period ofdisability, the Department of Veterans Affairs will no longer considerthe disabling effects of chronic alcoholism to be the result of willfulmisconduct. It also defines what the Department of Veterans Affairs considersthe disabling effects of alcoholism to be for this purpose. This amendmentwill have no effect on provisions of the regulations relating to the compensationand pension programs. Several minor amendments are made to other regulationswhich appear in 38 CFR Part 3 to bring them into agreement with the amendedandSection; 21.1043.The Department of Veterans Affairs has determined that these amended regulationsdo not contain a major rule as that term is defined by E.O. 12291, entitledFederal Regulation. The regulations will not have a $100 million annualeffect on the economy, and will not cause a major increase in costs orprices for anyone. They will have no significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability ofUnited States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprisesin domestic or export markets.The Secretary of Veterans Affairs certifies that these amended regulationswill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),5 U.S.C. 601-612. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the amended regulations,therefore, are exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibilityanalyses requirements of andSection;andSection; 603 and 604. This certificationcan be made because the regulations effect only individuals. They willhave no significant economic impact on small entities, i.e., small businesses,small private and nonprofit organizations and small governmental jurisdictions.The Department of Veterans Affairs is publishing the amended regulationsas interim, immediately effective regulations without obtaining prior publiccomment. The Department of Veterans Affairs finds that good cause existsfor dispensing with prior publication for public comment. As a result ofthe publicity surrounding the enactment of this law the Department of VeteransAffairs has already received many claims from potentially eligible Post-KoreanConflict veterans for an extension of the period of eligibility due tothe alleged disabling effects of chronic alcoholism. Yet the law prohibitspaying benefits to veterans eligible under the Post-Korean Conflict GIBill for education or training completed after December 31, 1989. The usualprocedure of first obtaining public comment would mean that it would bedifficult to have final regulations before the 1989 deadline. This mighthave the effect of denying benefits to veterans who might otherwise beentitled to them. Consequently, a delay for prior public comment wouldbe contrary to the public interest.Moreover, these regulations constitute an interpretive rule defining thestatutory term, ``disabling effects of chronic alcoholism'' for the purposeof an extension of the period of eligibility. This is necessary so thatthe Department of Veterans Affairs may act on the pending claims, sincethis new statutory term is not defined elsewhere.However, because the Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes that reasonablepersons may differ as to the interpretation of this term, we are invitingand will consider carefully comments on these interim regulations. Meanwhile,pending claims will be adjudicated on the basis of the interim regulation,so as not to delay an extension to those veterans who are clearly entitledto one.Furthermore, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has determined that goodcause exists for making the effective date of these regulations retroactivelyeffective on November 18, 1988. As noted above, to achieve the maximumbenefit of the legislation for the affected individuals, it is necessaryto implement this provision of law as soon as possible. A delayed effectivedate would be contrary to statutory design; would complicate administrationof these provisions of law; and might result in denial of a benefit toa veteran who is entitled by law to it.The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number for the program affectedby this regulation is 64.111.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 3</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Claims, Handicapped, Health care,Pensions, Veterans<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 21</ITAG>Civil rights, Claims, Education, Grant programs-education, Loan programs-education,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Schools, Veterans, Vocationaleducation, Vocational rehabilitation.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: July 7, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward J.
