The Recruit scandal has bedeviled Japanese politics for half ofTakeshita's 18-month tenure, and it appeared possible an elderpolitician might become interim prime minister until the situationis sorted out.   The candidate mentioned in many news reports was former ForeignMinister Masayoshi Ito, an elder statesman untouched by the Recruitscandal. But his health was in question _ he is a diabetic.   ``I think it should be a young person. It's time for a youngperson to be in charge,'' said Ito, 75-year-old chairman of theexecutive council of the governing Liberal Democratic Party.   Other powerful figures in the party that has governed Japansince 1955 are as tainted by money from the Recruit Co. asTakeshita, including his rival and party secretary general, formerForeign Minister Shintaro Abe.   ``The Recruit question has caused a grave crisis for thenation's parliamentary democracy,'' Takeshita, 65, said in anationwide television broadcast after telling the Cabinet of hisintention to resign.   ``I have decided to pull out in order to retrieve the public'strust in politics,'' he said. ``As the chief executive ofgovernment and president of the ruling party, I deeply apologize.''   Asked about the succession, he declined to comment, saying ``itis not the place of one resigning to express such opinions.''   Once Takeshita resigns, governing party members would choosetheir next party president, who would become prime minister due tothe Liberal Democrats' majority in both houses of parliament.   His resignation would also mean his entire Cabinet would leaveoffice. The party leadership also would be expected to resign, newsreports said.   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged after theannouncement. The Nikkei Stock Average rose 1.34 percent, theyear's third largest one-day gain.   Newspapers rushed out single-sheet extra editions with the news.The tabloid Fuji daily headlined ``Takeshita Finally Resigns.''   Vice President Dan Quayle said today the Bush administrationwould work with Takeshita's eventual successor. ``It's a democracyand whoever the leader of that democracy is, we'll work with,''Quayle said during a stop in Honolulu en route to American Samoaand Australia.   Takeshita's approval rating in a recent poll by Kyodo NewsService slumped to 3.9 percent, making him Japan's most unpopularpostwar prime minister.   In addition to the scandal, he was hurt by the introductionApril 1 of an unpopular 3 percent sales tax. And rural voters _ abastion of Liberal Democratic strength _ were disaffected by movesto liberalize agricultural imports.   Takeshita said he would leave office after parliament passes the1989 budget. But parliament, or the Diet, has been stalled by aboycott by opposition parties demanding that former Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone testify about the Recruit scandal.   There was a hint of progress on the issue this evening as thegoverning party said the opposition had agreed to participate inBudget Committee sessions. But the opposition still insisted on apromise that Nakasone would testify.   The Liberal Democrats have more than enough votes to ram thebudget through, but doing so would go against the Japanesetradition of politics by consensus.   Takako Doi, head of the Japan Socialist Party, the largestopposition group, said she wants new general elections andNakasone's testimony. ``I think it is nonsense to ask for thepassage of the budget in exchange for his (Takeshita's)resignation,'' she said.   Takeshita said he would go ahead with a nine-day trip to fiveSoutheast Asian nations starting Saturday, indicating he hopes theDiet will pass the budget in early May.   Takeshita had been clinging to office with a pledge to reformpolitics and reclaim public trust in politicians.   Recently, however, he acknowledged he received even more moneyfrom the Recruit Co. than the more than $1 million in what hecalled legal political donations that he earlier this monthadmitted getting.   During the weekend it was reported Takeshita he also received aloan of $381,700 from the information-publishing giant in 1987.Admitting the reports were true further embarrassed Takeshita.   The Recruit scandal broke last summer with revelations that thecompany had sold cut-price shares in a real estate subsidiary tomore than 150 politicians, bureaucrats, business leaders and mediaexecutives.   The shares, often bought with money lent by another Recruitsubsidiary, yielded fat profits when sold after the subsidiary wentpublic in 1986.   Takeshita, through an aide and a relative who actually held theshares, benefited to the tune of $192,000. Nakasone's aidessimilarly raked in about $460,000.   Three Cabinet ministers had resigned previously because of linksto Recruit. Prosecutors have so far arrested 14 people _ but nopoliticians _ in the case, charging them with bribery andsecurities law violations.   It is alleged that Recruit sought favors from bureaucrats whoregulated its main business in job-placement magazines and from topexecutives of companies with which it did business, includingNippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.   Although Japan has been known for money politics since the endof the war, the public was shocked by the amounts of money involvedand the broad spectrum of the establishment that was tainted.   The Recruit scandal has caused the greatest political fallout inJapan since former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka was accused in theLockheed affair in 1976. He was convicted of taking a $2 millionbribe after the U.S. aircraft company admitted it spent $12.1million to advance its sales in Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
