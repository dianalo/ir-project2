 Once theoperation is finished, the shell rereads the hard disk and reloads itself.andO;If you run several programs daily or use the shelf for DOS commands, theseconds it takes to reload can prey on your patience like a mosquito-not amajor delay, just a constant irritant.andM;Avoid that irritation by loading a DOS shell from a RAM drive.andP;  Then itdoesn't need to read the hard drive each time it reloads itself.andP;  Withprograms such as Norton Commander, the load time can be cut to a third orless.andP;  Running the shell from a RAM disk also helps with the shell's ownoperations.andP;  Norton Commander, for example, uses different overlays to viewfiles for DBASE and Lotus 1-2-3.andP;  Running it from a RAM drive cutsdramatically the time it takes to load each overlay.andM;Even if you don't use a DOS shell, you can't avoid using the DOS commandprocessor, COMMAND.COM.andP;  This part of the operating system contains many ofthe functions that are always available from the DOS prompt, such as COPY,DELETE, and CD.andP;  When you load bigger programs, they remove COMMAND.COM frOMRAM to make room for themselves.andP;  When you exit, DOS reloads COMMAND.COM fromdisk.andM;Eliminate the time it takes to restore DOS by putting COMMAND.COM, whichoccupies about 25 to 30K, on your RAM drive  D:).andP;  Then tell DOS where tofind it by adding these lines to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:andM;COPY C:\COMMAND.COM D:andM;SET COMSPEC=D:\COMMAND.COMandM;Some DOS commands really are programs.andP;  If you use FORMAT and DISKCOPYfrequently, they will cost you only about 84K on a RAM drive.andP;  The RAM diskis also a good place to run shareware programs you may use as often as DOScommands, such as DDIR, LIST, and WHERE.andM;AgendaandM;Files to use with RAM drive:andM;*.AGA, *.AGB (database).andM;Switches: None.andM;SETUPandM;To use Agenda's database files on aandM;RAM drive, first press F10 to bringandM;up the main menu.andP;  Then chooseandM;File Open and assign the letter ofandM;the RAM disk to which you'veandM;copied the files.andM;INDEXINGandM;Unindex any category that containsandM;information unique to individualandM;items.andP;  For example, if a categoryandM;is used to assign uniqueandM;serial numbers to each item in theandM;database, unindex it by highlightingandM;the category in the categoryandM;manager, pressing F10, and choosingandM;Unindex.andP;  (Note: Agenda'sandM;automatic completion featureandM;won't work for unindexed categories,andM;and you can't use an unindexedandM;category as a section head.)andM;CONDITIONSandM;Turn off text conditions for anyandM;family of categories not being usedandM;for text matching.andP;

 Instead,andM;create a new category such as AllandM;Items, use a condition to pull in allandM;items from the heavily inheritedandM;category, and then use the new categoryandM;as the section heading.andM;Avoid complex filters on views.andM;If a view has a complex filter suchandM;as &quot;all items assigned to categoriesandM;X, Y, and Z, but not A, B, and CandM;and that have When dates betweenandM;january and March,&quot;

 I've tasted computer speed- and now I'll never get my fill.andM;It started innocently enough---a few batch files and a little RAM drive oncein a while.andP;  I thought I could handle it But I was powerless over mycravings: I'm an addict who constantly needs a fix of computer speed.andM;I'm not satisfied that personal computers let me write, calculate, plan, andcommunicate in a fraction of the time it used to take.andP;  I want more speed-andthen still more.andP;  Give me a second and I want an hour.andM;But I've learned that I'm not alone and that there are respectable ways tofulfill the need that never leave.,; me.andM;My introduction to speed was when I bought my first computer-an Eagle PC.andP;  Nolonger did I have to spend hours retyping stories just to move a fewparagraphs around or to make them look neat for some anal-retentive editor.andO;The old Eagle paid for itself in a few months with the time it saved me.andP;  Ibragged compulsively to non-computer users about how it took only seconds tomove a sentence from the top to the bottom of a story, about how mydaisywheel Diablo printed out an entire page in a little more than a minute.andO;A minute, imagine !andP;  Then, as if I were in a romance gone sour, I began tonotice flaws in my beloved Eagle.andP;  it dawdled as it saved those stories tofloppies; I started using the saves as an excuse to get a cup of tea.andP;  itbecame coy as it recalculated spreadsheets, and my attention wandered to theTV.andP;  it ignored my needs and took 20 minutes to print a 30-page databasereport.andP;  Twenty minutes, imagine !andP;  That's when I came up with thefinger-drumming test, my answer to Norton SI.andP;  I measure the speed ofcomputer operations by how often and for how long I wind up drumming myfingers on the desktop.andP;  This measure Is more important to me thanmillisecond benchmarks.andP;  What really matters is my perception of speed.andP;  Anytime I spend waiting is unacceptable.andM;As the Eagle tarried, my fingers drummed, and the hunger returned.andP;  I was nolonger satisfied with saving hours of work.andP;  I wanted to hoard minutes, tostuff seconds in my cheeks like a time-crazed squirrel.andM;My first choice for more speed-a hard drive-forced me to get rid of the Eagleafter several abortive attempts at finding a hard drive that would work withit The Eagle was replaced by a Compaq Deskpro that not only had a hard disk,but-get this-was a whole 70 percent faster than an IBM PC, according toNorton Si, but more than twice as fast on the finger-drumming scale.andP;  A harddrive on the fastest PC available.andP;  What more could I want?andM;Two months later, in August 1984, IBM introduced the AT.andM;I was able to ignore its existence for a long while.andP;  The fact that I wasstill paying for the Compaq helped a lot.) Meanwhile, I found other, lessexpensive ways to goose a little more speed from my Compaq.andM;When I got the machine, I was blissfully ignorant of the fact that some harddrives are faster than others.andP;  I just bought the biggest I could afford:20MB.andP;  But while working on a friend's computer, I noticed that programs wereloading faster and saves took less time on his hard drive.andP;  I didn't have torun benchmark tests,- the difference was obvious--and taunting.andM;A new hard drive was out of the question, but a program to defragment mysadly overworked drive wasn't The $39 I spent for Disk Optimizer was one ofmy smartest software purchases.andP;  it didn't make my drive as fast as myfriend's, but it reduced the finger-drumming factor.andM;A run-length-limited disk controller helped solve the constant problem ofrunning out of disk space, and it also stepped up disk speed appreciably-notto supersonic levels, mind you, but it did carve off a few seconds here andthere.andP;  Speed addicts like me grab at every second they can get.andM;A few utility programs helped me use software faster.andP;  At various times,either ProKey or SuperKey has been a standard part of My AUTOEXEC-.BAT.andP;  Icreated macros for every program I use regularly, eliminating myfumble-fingered typos and reducing complicated commands to a single key.andO;stroke.andP;  SpinRite gave my laboring hard drive still another boost byresetting its interleave not a tremendous boos% but one I was grateful for.andM;I was at one of those momentary stages of satiation that even gluttonsoccasionally encounter until I took on the regular duty of running a11,000-record database application once a week.andP;  After all the newinformation was entered, it took more than an hour for the database managerto chum through the hard drive as it sorted and combined information toproduce its report.andP;  The job blew the finger-drumming factor off the chart.andM;A new hard drive was still out of the question, but after months of searchingfor a 286 board that would work with the Compaq's 8086 design, I discoveredthe SOTA 2861 add-in board-a speed addict's dream come true.andP;  Not only did itdevote 16K to faster screen displays and give me a Norton Si rating of 11.5,it cut the time it took to do my weekly database chore from more than an hourto less than 20 minutes.andP;  (There's a lesson here.andP;  Although the common wisdomis that the disk drive is the most important factor in the speed of databaseapplications, you shouldn't overlook processing speed.)andM;At last I had a machine that was faster than an IBM AT  if you ignored thestill stodgy hard drives).andM;But was I happy? Of course not I had also taken on a regular task of workingwith a large, complicated spreadsheet.andP;  Although the spreadsheet let me do inless than an hour a job that used to take two evenings, the fingers begandrumming during recalculations.andM;Luckily, the SOTA 2861 has a socket for an intel 80287 math coprocessor.andP;  The80287 trimmed spreadsheet operations by about 10 to 15 percent.andP;  is thatworth a couple hundred bucks? Of course it is! You don't ask questions likethat of someone who's tasted computer speed.andM;The latest addition to the feast is an intel Aboveboard with 2MB of expandedmemory.andP;  I got the board to take advantage of programs that use expandedmemory.andP;  (WordPerfect virtually sings when it has access to expanded memory.)andO;it also helped solve my perennial slow drive problem.andP;  Using PC-Kwik'sdisk-caching program with expanded memory improved apparent disk performanceso much that now my fingers are drumming only while programs are loading orI'm saving files.andM;Of course, those hard drives do take an awfully long time to load programsand execute saves ...andM;Sorry-there I go again.andP;  I've just got to see someone about this monkey on mykeyboard.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
