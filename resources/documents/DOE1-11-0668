A week later, vertigoand right hand numbness were added to his symptoms. The next day anisocoria(right andgt; left) and dilation of the left retinal veins were noted. Cranialcomputed tomography (CT) scan appeared normal and there were no otherremarkable neurological findings. The patient was treated conservativelyfor cerebral infarction, however, the headache worsened and diplopiaoccurred. Neurological examination on admission revealed nothing unusualexcept for left Horner's syndrome. Physical examination showed a palpablesausage-like painless tumor on the left side of the neck. Angiographyshowed a narrowing of the internal carotid artery in the cervical regionwith a small dissecting aneurysm at the C3 level. Cervical CT scan atthe upper C3 level showed a low density lunar defect in the high densitysection of the enlarged left internal carotid artery. The patient wasoperated on by superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosisto increase the intracranial blood flow. Postoperatively the symptomswere quickly relieved. Angiography 1 month later showed less narrowingof the carotid artery, though the dissecting aneurysm still remained.Postoperative cervical CT scan showed the left internal carotid arteryto be of normal size. The patient returned to his work in normal condition2 months later. It is emphasized that cervical CT scan may be usefulin the diagnosis of this unusual type of cervical dissecting aneurysm.</TEXT></DOC>
