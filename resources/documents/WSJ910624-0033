Several computer makers are investigating a new technologythat allows one machine on a network to tap into the brainsof other computers that are switched on but aren't beingused. The increase in power can often be sizable, allowing adesktop computer to act like a supercomputer.   Workstations sold by Next Computer, for example, includean experimental program called Zilla. Faced with a big task,Zilla asks whether other machines are willing to help. Tocooperate, a computer must have its own copy of the program.Each friendly computer gets a chunk of work, which it'ssupposed to complete at night, during a lunch break orwhenever the machine's owner isn't working. If the ownersuddenly starts tapping at his keyboard, Zilla puts the jobon hold and waits for an idle spell to work on it again.   Richard Crandall, Next's chief scientist, compares theprocess to recycling, noting that most computers are usedonly four hours a day. &quot;We're so used to letting these thingssit around,&quot; he says, &quot;but staying up all night is somethingcomputers love to do.&quot;   The new technique works best with tasks that are easilysplit up, such as calculating the frames of acomputer-animated movie. At International Business Machines,technical guru Robert Carberry says IBM is studying a similarsystem that may help computers search large databases, but hewarns that most mainstream software isn't amenable to theapproach. As a result, he says, IBM will use the method firston its RS/6000 workstations aimed at scientists andengineers.                                                                                                          Chips Made With X-Rays   Can Use Smaller `Masks'                                                                                                          ATandamp;T may have found a better way to make chips withX-rays.   The microscopic details on computer chips are currentlymade in much the same way as photographs, by shining lightthrough a &quot;mask&quot; onto photo-sensitive material. Because lightcan be focused through reducing lenses, this method producesdetails that are much smaller than those on the mask --allowing the mask, in turn, to remain large enough to beinspected and repaired easily.   As chip features get tinier, however, makers will beforced to work with X-rays, which have shorter wavelengthsand are very hard to focus. The leading X-ray technique,championed by IBM, avoids focusing entirely: The Xray beamsimply casts a chipsized shadow on the material. But IBM'ssolution requires very small masks and poses thornymanufacturing problems.   Now American Telephone andamp; Telegraph's Bell Laboratories hasreported progress on a different approach, which it says willallow the use of larger X-ray masks. The technique won't beatIBM to market, but may prove more useful in the long term.ATandamp;T's researchers designed a mask with many tiny layers thatreflect Xrays rather than letting them pass through. Themirror-like mask is curved, meaning it can produce a reducedimage without a lens. &quot;There's reason to believe that theseoptics will work,&quot; says Richard Howard of Bell Labs.   IBM claims its method is five years ahead and plans toopen X-ray production lines around 1995. But ATandamp;T has &quot;openedup the field,&quot; says David Attwood of the Department ofEnergy's Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.                                                                                                          Trucks Turn to Radar   To Avoid Collisions                                                                                                          TRUCKERS LOOK for high-technology help to avoidcollisions.   Next month, a Maryland hauling firm will begin testing asystem that uses radar to warn its drivers if they're tooclose to the vehicle ahead. Four tractor-trailers owned byPreston Trucking will be equipped with a product from IVHSTechnologies, a small firm in San Diego, Calif., that hasreceived backing from the Allstate insurance unit of SearsRoebuck.   If the test goes well, Preston says it will buy devicesfor its entire fleet. &quot;The day is going to come when radar isstandard equipment on tractor-trailers,&quot; says Donald Hansen,Preston's vice president of safety. IVHS is also testing awarning device for automobiles and plans a system that willautomatically apply a vehicle's brakes in dangeroussituations. As a bonus, the devices record speed and otherdata, helping police reconstruct accidents.   Radar systems for vehicles have been proposed in the past,and several auto makers are exploring the field. But problemsare rife: False alarms can be caused by guard rails,signposts, even the road itself. In addition, low-power radarisn't great at spotting humans, animals and some bicycles.With increasing use of plastics and &quot;composite&quot; materials,many cars are also quite stealthy.   IVHS President Paul Bouchard says the company has solvedthese problems, a claim also made by Vehicle Radar SafetySystems, Mount Clemens, Mich. VRSS says its radar warningsystem is much smaller than IVHS's and will be available for$560 to $800 by the end of the year. IVHS said its devicewill cost about $1,100 a truck.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          EDWARD TITLEBAUM, a scientist at the University ofRochester, N.Y., proposes improving cellular-phonetransmissions by mimicking the sonar of dolphins, whosesignals don't interfere with one another. . . .
