At least 19 people were killed in the April 9 clash in theGeorgian capital, Tbilisi.   In the Baltic republic of Lithuania, thousands rallied Sunday tomourn the victims. And at a rally in Moscow, human rights activistAndrei D. Sakharov led about 500 people in a minute of silence forthe dead.   In a report Sunday, Pravda quoted Shevardnadze as saying thecurfew in the southern republic could be lifted today.   Tbilisi has generally been quiet, though tense, since thedeaths. An 11 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew imposed after thedemonstrations has been cut back to midnight to 5 a.m., localactivist Sergei Dandurov said by telephone.   During the unrest, Shevardnadze said the army ``marched and wasstationed in certain places under orders given by the leadership ofthe republic,'' the Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported.   Shevardnadze said the decision to use troops to quell theprotests was opposed by Col. Gen. I.N. Rodionov, commander of aregion that includes Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.   ``The commander said the function the troops were ordered toperform was not the responsibility of the army,'' Pravda quotedShevardnadze as saying in a speech Friday to the Georgian CommunistParty's Central Committee.   On Friday, the republic's party chief resigned after acceptingresponsibility for the April 9 clash in a main square of Tbilisi,and the republic's premier was also fired as a result.   Shevardnadze was sent to the region to help restore order. He isa native Georgian and former chief of the republic's CommunistParty.   State-run Radio Moscow said 20 people died and more than 150were injured in the April 9 clashe. The official Georgian newsagency Gruzinform said the death toll remained at 19.   In Tbilisi, residents turned out Sunday for the final twofunerals for the victims, said Gruzinform's deputy director, ZurabLomidze.   About 30,000 people rallied Sunday in the Lithanian city ofVilnius in memory of the dead, according to Valdas Anelauskas, alocal journalist for the dissident paper Express-Khronika.   Speaking in a telephone interview, he reported that protesterscarried banners saying, ``The Soviet Army is a band ofheadchoppers'' and ``Let the bloody communist system be cursed.''   No arrests or violence were reported.   Sakharov, the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said during theMoscow rally that he blamed the bloodshed in Tbilisi on measuresadopted last summer in Moscow requiring advance permission fordemonstrations.   Sakharov, who is running for a seat in the new Congress ofPeople's Deputies, said he would fight to revoke the decrees ifelected.   The Soviet Union has witnessed a resurgence of regionalnationalism under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The nationalistsoften profess to back Gorbachev's social and political reformswhile demanding more autonomy or even secession from Moscow.</TEXT></DOC>
