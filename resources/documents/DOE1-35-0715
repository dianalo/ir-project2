He was the first son of non-consanguineoushealthy parents. All other family members were normal. The increase ofhead circumference was first noted at 6 months of age. He could not walkuntil 1 1/2 years old. He had febrile convulsions at 1 1/2 and 2 yearsold. On admission (3 y 10 mo), his head circumference was 55.8 cm (morethan 98th percentile). Intelligence was normal for his age. Neurologicalexamination revealed ataxic-spastic gait and generalized hyperreflexiawith bilateral ankle clonus. He could not run, or stand on one foot.Sensation was normal. CT scan showed diffuse low density areas in cerebralwhite matter, especially in frontal lobes. Ventricular systems were ofnormal size. Leukocyte lysosomal enzyme activities, blood and urinaryamino acid analysis, the amount of very long chain fatty acids in plasmasphingomyelin, blood gas analysis, and organic acid levels in urine wereall within normal range. Electroencephalogram, auditory-evoked response,nerve conduction velocities, and cerebrospinal fluid examination werealso normal. The diagnosis of Alexander's disease was most likely. However,this case was atypical, in that his mental development was quite normal,and that regression of his motor activities was not noted so far. Magneticresonance imaging (spin-echo image) revealed widespread abnormal signalintensity areas corresponding to the low densities shown by CT, whereboth T/sub 1/ and T/sub 2/ relaxation times were prolonged, suggestingthe increase of free water content in the affected white matter. Thesechanges were localized in cerebral white matter and more prominent infrontal lobes. On the other hand, the white matter of cerebellum andbrain stem, internal capsule, and anterior commisure looked normal. (J.P.N.).</TEXT></DOC>
