The protein, called CD4, was produced in genetically-engineered mammalian cells and tested with the virus in cell culture, where it &quot;virtually abolished the growth of HIV-1,&quot; the AIDS virus, scientists said.    The work by Genentech research scientist Daniel J. Capon and colleagues is slated for publication today in the journal Science. Other authors of the paper include Genentech scientists Douglas H. Smith, Scot A. Marsters, and Timothy Gregory in collaboration with Jerome E. Groopman and Randal A. Byrn of New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston.    The substance still faces months to years of animal and human testing before any potential benefits to AIDS patients can be ascertained. The Science paper is the first major scientific report on what is expected to be an important avenue of research into AIDS therapy.    In its natural form, the protein normally is found on the outside of T4 cells, white blood cells that are key sentries of the immune system. These cells are selectively targeted and killed by the fatal virus. When the virus seeks out its targets, a protein on its outer coat binds to CD4 protein on the T4 cells -- a key step in infection.    Scientists hope that injecting the synthetic CD4 molecules would flood the body with &quot;false targets&quot; to divert the virus and keep it from infecting whole healthy T4 cells.    Genentech research scientist Daniel Capon said he believes CD4 works in several ways: by blocking direct infection by free-floating virus; by preventing the formation of giant cells that foment cell-to-cell spread and mass cell death; and by preventing the immune system's turning against healthy T4 cells which aren't infected but have merely brushed up against the virus's outer coat and &quot;look&quot; infected.    Still, he cautioned: &quot;I don't think this is going to be a cure. It may contain the virus.&quot; One problem scientists haven't solved is how to reach the virus as it lies latent inside infected cells.    Genentech is one of several laboratories now developing CD4, along with researchers at SmithKline Beckman Corp., Biogen, and Harvard University. Earlier this week, SmithKline announced it was working on the substance as well.    Richard Axel, a professor of biochemistry at Columbia University who is working with the SmithKline group, cautioned: &quot;We know too little about the patho-physiology of this disease to be overconfident. I don't want to introduce false hopes.&quot; He said his group and several others plan to publish their findings in the British journal Nature in about two weeks.    Other investigators in the field of AIDS therapy voiced controlled optimism. &quot;I think it's a very interesting concept,&quot; said Samuel Broder, director of clinical oncology at the National Cancer Institute, a unit of the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Broder, whose lab first discovered the efficacy of Burroughs-Wellcome Co.'s AZT, said he confirmed the test-tube activity of Genentech's CD4 as well.    &quot;What we're seeing here is the development of potential experimental agents based on what we know about the life cycle of the virus. That's the kind of translation from laboratory to clinic that we need to encourage,&quot; Dr. Broder said.    However, he and other scientists cautioned that because CD4 has a role in normal activities of the immune system, doctors will need to test the synthetic molecule for toxic effects -- namely any upset in immune function. So far, however, test-tube studies don't suggest CD4 has great toxic potential.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Genentech shares closed at $37, down $1.50. </TEXT></DOC>
