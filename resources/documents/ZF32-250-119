Multiply the total by the average number of clients you have contactwith each day.andM;Let me give an example based on my own situation:andM;The average annual client consulting fee $ 5,000andM;Word-of-mouth impact ($5,000 x 2)        $10,000andM;support for an average of five clients/dayandM;($10,000 x 5)                              $50,000andM;The resulting dollar amount is the &quot;at-risk&quot; value of your consultingpractice for that day.andP;  Even if you plug in conservative annual consultingfees, the amount is significant.andM;If you look at the value of that existing client this way, you might changeyour views regarding hiring, training, compensating, and spending on tools toaid the client-service process.andM;One more tip: It might be best if you set aside a specific quiet time whereincoming calls can be attended to.andP;  I always find that talking to clientswhen I'm concentrating on them and their problems is much better thanhandling their calls on the fly.andM;Bill French is V.P.andP;  of Product Development for Global Technologies Corp., aproduct development and consulting firm in Aurora, Colorado.andP;  He can becontacted at (303) 337-7758.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
