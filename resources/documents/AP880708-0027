KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Reagan administration's bid to sell Kuwait40 advanced F-18 fighters is running into strong congressionalopposition as the Senate votes to strip a potent missile from thewarplane's weapons inventory.   The Senate action to remove the air-to-ground Maverick missilefrom the $1.9 billion arms package came only hours after theadministration formally asked Congress to approve the sale to giveoil-rich Kuwait a ``first line of defense'' in a region racked bythe war between Iran and Iraq.   Before the measure was adopted on a voice vote, senators madeclear they believe the Maverick would pose a security threat toIsrael if it should fall into the hands of the Arab enemies of theJewish state.   Earlier Thursday, before a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee,administration officials said the Maverick was an essential part ofthe F-18's defensive systems and part of an arms package sostructured as to pose no threat to Israel.   But critics said the sale would fuel an escalating arms race inthe volatile Persian Gulf.   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., at first attempted to bar thesale of Mavericks to any nation in the Persian Gulf region, thenmodified his proposal to apply to Kuwait only.   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said that if he had his way he wouldcondition the sale of the Maverick and other ``state-of-the-art''weapons to Middle East nations only if they ``renounce the use offorce and recognize the right of Israel to exist.''   Congress has 30 days to block the F-18 sale. Otherwise it goesahead.   Although there is wide opposition in Congress to sellingsensitive high technology weapons to Middle East nations it was notclear whether a ban on transferring Mavericks to Kuwait willeventually become law.   Testifying before a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee, PeterBurleigh, assistant deputy secretary of state for Near Easternaffairs, described the Maverick as an essential element in a purelydefensive package.   Burleigh said the deal is in the interests of the United Stateswhich is using naval forces to protect the ships of Kuwait andother nations sailing through the Persian Gulf.   ``Friendly states should be their own first line of defense, sowe don't have to be,'' Burleigh said.   ``By helping a moderate gulf state assume greater responsibilityfor its own defense, it complements our highly successful escortoperations,'' he said.   Burleigh also testified that a group of U.S. allies will soonannounce a major arms sale to Saudi Arabia, another major oilproducing Arab state on the Persian Gulf.   One subcommittee member, Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., described thepending sale to Saudi Arabia as ``enormous,'' running into the``tens of billions of dollars.''   Burleigh said he was not able to disclose which countries areinvolved in the deal, the nature of the weapons to be sold or theirtotal value.   The Reagan administration seeks to sell Kuwait not only the 40F-18s but their armaments as well. Other than the Maverick, theweapons include Sidewinder, Sparrow and Harpoon missiles andcluster bombs.   The missiles are among the most advanced air-to-air andair-to-surface weapons in the U.S. inventory.   But Burleigh said only limited quantities of the missiles arebeing provided, ``far less than would be necessary for an offensivepurpose.''   Under the terms of the agreement with Kuwait, the first of theaircraft would be delivered in 1991 and the remainder over the nextthree years.   Responding to critical questioning, Burleigh said F-18s inKuwait will not have the range required to strike at targets inIsrael and that Kuwait will not be sold the tanker aircraft neededto increase that range.</TEXT></DOC>
