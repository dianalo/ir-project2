Carol Fennelly, a moving force behind the capital city'sCommunity for Creative Non-Violence shelter for the homeless, wasthe first to break the fast, at 9 a.m. EST with a meal of pea soup,apple juice and sourdough bread sent by well-wishers from SanFrancisco.   She then checked into Howard University Hospital, where she waslisted in critical condition after undergoing a series of tests thatrevealed a dangerously low blood potassium level. Her condition waslater upgraded to serious.   Hospital spokesman Norman Brooks said Fennelly, 39, would likelysurvive.   ``She looked weak, but she was conscious,'' Brooks said.   ``She is not in great shape,'' said Mitch Snyder, founder of theshelter. ``Her veins are completely shot and she has no bloodpressure,''   Three hours after Fennelly ate her first meal since September,seven other activists, including Snyder, ended similar fasts. Snydersaid the protest was staged to get Congress to restore the 75percent of the nation's housing budget that has been cut over thepast seven years and, in general, to draw attention to the plight ofthe homeless.   ``We did what we believe is right,'' Snyder said. ``We aren'tconcerned about the impact ... we just hope something will happen.''   Snyder, whose life story was told in a network television movie,has fasted numerous times to protest the conditions that homelesspeople endure. Fennelly, Snyder's longtime companion, lost more than40 pounds during the fast, which was designed to end on Election Day.   A week ago, Snyder conceded that the group's fasting tacticsmight seem a bit crazy to some. ``Yeah, it's nuts that some peoplehave to do this in order to get housing for people and shelter forpeople,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
