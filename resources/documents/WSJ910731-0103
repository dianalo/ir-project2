But Mr. Bush didn't deliver only sunny messages at thestart of a two-day summit meeting with Soviet PresidentMikhail Gorbachev. He told the Soviets they can't expect muchdirect aid from the West until they finish the painfulprocess of working out a plan for an economic overhaul withthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;A shortage of foreign capital is not what plunged youreconomy into crisis, nor can your economic ills be cured by asimple infusion of cash,&quot; Mr. Bush said in a speech at theMoscow State Institute for International Relations.   He also warned that political disputes -- particularlyover the Soviet Union's aid to Cuba and its continuedoccupation of Pacific islands claimed by Japan -- could standin the way of wholesale aid from the industrialized world.   Mr. Gorbachev showed some displeasure with the continuedU.S. caution on economic assistance, complaining during adinner toast last night that there is an &quot;increasinglyobvious discrepancy&quot; between U.S.-Soviet economic relationsand their cooperation on political and arms-control issues.   Earlier yesterday, with the two presidents taking time outfor a brief stroll to meet tourists on a warm and pleasantsummer day in Red Square, the talks focused on economicissues, U.S. officials said. Today, Messrs. Bush andGorbachev will move to the more intimate setting of theSoviet leader's suburban Moscow dacha to talk about thefuture of arms control and the possibility of soon calling ajoint U.S.-Soviet peace conference for the Middle East. Theyalso will sign the long-awaited Strategic Arms ReductionTalks -- or Start -- treaty, the first agreement to reduceU.S. and Soviet arsenals of big intercontinental nuclearweapons.   Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev hope that the combinationof the strategic arms treaty and the dismantling of economicbarriers will mark this summit as the occasion in which theyclosed the Cold War era for good and moved on to a newrelationship for the 1990s.   &quot;In the next two days, President Gorbachev and I hope tobuild upon this beginning to forge a U.S.-Soviet agenda builtnot upon military confrontation but upon economic andsecurity cooperation,&quot; Mr. Bush said as he arrived at theKremlin to open the summit.   A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows thatAmericans continue to support moving to such a phase ofeconomic cooperation with the Soviet Union. A majority ofvoters, 52%, said the U.S. should help the Soviet Unionstrengthen its economy, while 39% said the U.S. shouldn't doso. The responses were roughly the same in June. The surveywas conducted by pollsters Peter Hart and Robert Teeter lastweek among 1,004 registered voters nationwide.   The two U.S. moves on trade and credit ties were longanticipated and hardly guarantee a big economic boost to Mr.Gorbachev. Still, Soviet officials consider them importantsymbolic statements of support for Mr. Gorbachev's fitfuleconomic reform efforts.   First, Mr. Bush said that upon his return to Washington,he will send Congress a formal U.S.-Soviet trade agreementfor approval, a step that will lead to granting the Sovietsmost-favored-nation trading status. MFN status, which mostU.S. trading partners have, guarantees the best availabletariff and quota treatment under U.S. law. For years, U.S.objections to Soviet emigration policy had prevented thebestowal of that status. And in recent months, the tradetreaty and MFN status had been held up by technical snagsover new Soviet laws that U.S. officials said didn'tadequately protect intellectual-property rights.   Under special procedures for considering trade treaties,Congress will have 90 days to either approve the treatywithout amendment or to disapprove it. Support for the treatyand MFN status for the Soviets is broad in Congress, and theagreement is likely to be approved.   In his second significant economic move, Mr. Bush said hewill ask Congress to eliminate two existing laws thatrestrict Soviet eligibility for credits from theExport-Import Bank and other U.S. government agencies. Thetwo laws, known as the Stevenson and Byrd amendments, put aceiling of $300 million on Ex-Im financing and declare thatno other U.S. government agency can grant more than $300million in loans, loan guarantees or export insurance to theSoviet Union without prior congressional approval. OnlyCommodity Credit Corp., which has financed big U.S. grainsales to the Soviet Union, has been exempted from theceiling.   The effect of the steps will be muted by U.S. companies'wariness of the bleak Soviet financial picture and thepolitical uncertainty created by feuding between the Sovietcentral government and its 15 republics.   But some new business will be generated, and somecompanies stand to benefit immediately, particularly PepsiCoInc., which bottles soft drinks here and exports Stolichnayavodka to the U.S. &quot;It's going to help us sell a lot morePepsi . . . {and} help Stolichnaya become much morecompetitive in the U.S. market,&quot; said John Swanhaus,president of the PepsiCo wines and spirits division.   Mr. Swanhaus said MFN status would mean the vodka couldenter the U.S. with a duty of eight cents a bottle, ratherthan the $1.07 at present. That should increase vodka sales,which then would enable Pepsi to sell more of its soft drinksin the U.S.S.R. under a complex barter agreement that tiesPepsi production to vodka sales.   There also could be some immediate increase in exports ofSoviet computer software to the U.S., business leaders heresay.   The rescission of the Stevenson and Byrd amendments couldbe significant because it could free up U.S.government-guaranteed capital to flow into the Soviet Unionat a time when private lending has all but dried up. AWestern banker, noting that the Soviet Union has about $20billion of short-term debt obligations, says commercial banksaren't advancing any credit to the Soviet Union.   Until now, some U.S. corporations doing large projects inthe Soviet Union have been able to raise money throughEuropean export credit-guarantee companies, but the size ofthe Soviet foreign debt and worries that it may need toreschedule the debt have made such guarantees prohibitivelyexpensive.   The U.S. and the Soviet Union also signed narroweragreements calling for new cooperation in disasterassistance, emergency medical supplies, civil-aviationsecurity, and housing and economic development. The housingagreement is designed to help the Soviets, who suffer achronic shortage of state-built housing, develop a privatehousing industry. The medical agreement will provide U.S.assistance to deal with acute and immediate shortages ofpharmaceutical and medical supplies. U.S. officials hope suchagreements providing technical help will show that there areways to help Mr. Gorbachev without doling out cash.   For their part, Soviet officials welcome these moves butalso want the U.S. to go further in helping them integrateinto the world economy. During remarks at a state dinner lastnight, Mr. Gorbachev told Mr. Bush that the U.S. shouldeliminate all of its traditional restrictions onhigh-technology exports that have possible militaryapplication to the Soviet Union. He said &quot;the securityconcerns used to justify the existence&quot; of these lists havedisappeared and complained that the lists continue to hampercompletion of major business projects.   Americans seem to think Mr. Gorbachev is worth cooperatingwith and generally can be trusted. When asked in the new WallStreet Journal/NBC News poll whether Mr. Gorbachev will stillbe leading the Soviet Union a year from now, a slightmajority, 53%, said he will be, and 34% predicted he will begone by then. In March, only 42% of those surveyed predictedhe would survive another year. And asked whether the Sovietscan be trusted to honor the new Start agreement, 51% said theKremlin can be trusted and 43% disagreed.</TEXT></DOC>
