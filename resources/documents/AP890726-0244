IBM said Tuesday its 4-megabit chip can store the equivalent ofabout 400 pages of double-spaced typewritten text on a sliver ofsilicon the size of a small fingernail.   The major Japanese computer makers are also making 4-megabitchips, but have not announced any products using them. IBM was alsothe first to bring out products using the previous generation 1million-bit chip.   ``This clearly demonstrates IBM's world leadership in this areaand our commitment to put technology to work for our customers,''said Patrick A. Toole, IBM's general manager of technology products.   Rather than a full-fledged computer, the first product using thechip will be a memory expansion card that can be installed in thepowerful Model 70 and Model 80 of IBM's Personal System-2 line ofpersonal computers.   One version of the memory card is available immediately at aprice of $1,795. Versions holding more data will be available inlimited quantities later this year and generally in 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
