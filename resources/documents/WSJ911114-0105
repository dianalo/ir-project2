But Mr. Kemp is unswayed, these officials said. At aclosed-door meeting of the cabinet's Economic Policy Councilyesterday that participants described as &quot;contentious,&quot; Mr.Kemp continued to argue that President Bush should keepCongress in session and press for tax cuts.</LP><TEXT>   Nearly all of Mr. Bush's economic advisers are againstpressing a tax cut this year. &quot;The decision has been made. He{Kemp} is the only holdout,&quot; an administration official said.For now, the president's main economic advisers -- includingTreasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Budget Director RichardDarman and economic adviser Michael Boskin -- are inclined tocontinue to lambaste Congress for avoiding action onproposals already made and to wait until next year to pushany new proposals.   In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, in speechesand on television talk shows, Mr. Kemp has been increasinglycritical of the administration's stance on tax cuts. Butyesterday, he wasn't talking. A spokesman for Mr. Kemp said,&quot;He is not commenting on anything that occurred at themeeting.&quot;   The president himself wasn't at the meeting. Officialssaid that Andrew Card, deputy to White House Chief of StaffJohn Sununu, told Mr. Kemp before his appearance on CBS's&quot;Face the Nation&quot; last Sunday that the White House preferredthat he not publicly air his differences with the WhiteHouse.   Mr. Kemp has been careful not to criticize Mr. Bushdirectly and, in fact, has argued that he supports policiesthe president already advocates. But he has been complainingthat Mr. Bush's other advisers are too timid and are givinghim poor political and economic advice.</TEXT></DOC>
