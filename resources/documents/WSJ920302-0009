If you'recraving a &quot;hot&quot; initial public offering, chances are youwon't get it. And if you do obtain one easily, chances areyou'll regret it.   After last week's spectacular debuts by such familiarnames as camping-equipment supplier Coleman Co. and publisherScholastic Corp., the average investor can't help but hungerfor quick profits in IPOs. Both stocks jumped 25% or more infirst-day trading; software maker Synopsys Inc. rocketed 75%,and Callaway Golf Co., maker of the Big Bertha oversized golfclub, made a spellbinding arrival Friday as it began trading80% above its initial offering price.</LP><TEXT>   Small investors may be tempted to buy such stocks evenafter the first-day fireworks. But that's a bad idea, sayseveral longtime observers of new-issues markets, who arguethat it's better to wait to buy until some of these stocksfall out of favor.   &quot;If it's truly a good deal, you're not going to get apiece of it,&quot; says John Markese, research director of theAmerican Association of Individual Investors in Chicago. Mr.Markese advises investors to &quot;wait a year or more&quot; beforere-examining whether to buy a once-hot IPO.   In the mutual-back-scratching world of underwriting,investment bankers typically parcel out the best deals totheir best customers, namely the large institutions and&quot;hedge funds&quot; on which underwriters rely for a large part oftheir trading commissions. &quot;Institutions dominate thehot-issues market,&quot; says John W. Peavy III, a financeprofessor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, who hasstudied why individuals rarely get popular deals. &quot;What'sleft, typically you don't want.&quot;   Michael Berlin, a vice president with a closely heldcement company in Bethlehem, Pa., began researching IPOs lastyear through newsletters and filing documents.&quot;Research-wise, I think IPOs allow a novice investor to be onequal footing with everyone else,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't have thetime to research and accumulate all the data out there on GMand Apple and the big companies. And I don't have theprescience to ferret out the turnaround deals.&quot;   Mr. Berlin's IPO picks have, for the most part, been goodones: Last year he got in on the successful offering in Parisof EuroDisney. But this year he chose Scholastic and Coleman,and both deals were oversubscribed by the time he selectedthem. &quot;It's very frustrating to do the research and then findout you can't get in,&quot; he says. He knew he had missed hischance when both deals were priced higher than expected.   Such are the &quot;perverse rules&quot; of underwriting, says JayRitter, finance professor at the University of Illinois. Inmost businesses, lowering prices attracts buyers, and raisingthem has the opposite effect. Not so with many new stockofferings. When the size and initial price of an offering areboosted, Mr. Ritter says, &quot;it's much more likely to jump inprice&quot; on the first trading day. &quot;The hotter the deal, themore institutional money will be involved,&quot; driving the pricehigher. &quot;Then the hedge funds will come and go,&quot; he adds. Asthey did with Synopsys.   Wednesday morning, hedge funds, which often buy popularIPOs and sell them the same day for quick profits, werepoised for Synopsys. The fast-growing, Silicon Valley makerof high-tech software used by computer engineers was broughtpublic by Morgan Stanley in an offering of just two millionshares. At an 8 a.m. EST meeting of one trading firm, whichasked not to be identified, the deal was described as &quot;hot&quot;;it was expected to trade up a &quot;few points&quot; from its filingprice of $18 a share, already higher than the original$13-to-$15 range. Traders stared in disbelief when it openedat $28.50.   &quot;This is stupid, stupid, stupid,&quot; one trader said as hebegan taking orders from hedge funds with code names such as&quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Green Lantern.&quot; Hedge funds, which bet thatcertain stocks will rise and others will drop, are known toplay IPOs both on the way up and the way down. As Synopsysinexorably climbed -- hitting an intraday high of 33 --another, seasoned trader took a strategic but inaccurateguess: &quot;Buy in spades until 1.5 million {shares} trade, thenit breaks and falls to 25 1/2.&quot; But the stock never didbreak. On Friday it eased 3/8, to 30 3/4.   Synopsys has a promising future, but like many companiesin overheated markets it will have a tough time meetingexpectations already reflected in the stock, Prof. Rittersays. Revenue is expected to jump nearly 47% to $59.5 millionfor the fiscal year ending in September; earnings could surgeto 55 cents a share from 27 cents a year earlier, analystssay.   But in one fleeting day, Synopsys became far moreexpensive than competitors. The stock's market value is morethan 8 1/2 times 1991 revenue. Meanwhile, Viewlogic trades atabout six times sales and Cadence Design and Mentor Graphicssell for less than three times revenue.   Synopsys' stock-market value of $384 million compares with$540 million in projected 1992 sales for all the companies inits industry combined, warns Charles Foundyller, president ofDaratech Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., which tracks thecomputer-aided design business. Synopsys &quot;may have rapidgrowth for a couple of years, but I think they'll hit a brickwall at {sales of} about $100 million,&quot; Mr. Foundyller says.   Studies by Prof. Ritter and other academics have shownrepeatedly that investors who buy popular IPOs in hot marketsare likely to be disappointed. Evidence from the past 17years shows that companies going public when there's littleIPO volume outperform the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index forseveral years, according to Prof. Ritter. &quot;Companies that gopublic in hot markets generally underperform,&quot; he says.&quot;Buying when the market is soft gives you the best long-runreturns.&quot; And nobody can call this market soft-not withScholastic trading at 28 1/8 Friday after going public lastweek at 22 1/2, and Coleman at 24 7/8 compared with a midweekoffering price of 19 1/2.   One other odd feature of the new-issues market is &quot;thewinner's curse,&quot; Prof. Ritter adds. &quot;If you win the sharesyou ask for, it's more likely you don't want them.&quot;   It's a curse Mr. Berlin hasn't escaped. Last year heeasily bought 200 initial shares of Government TechnologyServices, which provides computer equipment to the federalgovernment. &quot;A broker said it was a great company and a hotissue,&quot; he says. &quot;I didn't have any trouble getting any.&quot;Offered at $12 each, the shares quickly rose to 16, then sankas low as 9. They were at 14 Friday. Mr. Berlin says anotherbroker recently warned him: &quot;If it's easy to get shares, it'sbecause no one else wants them.&quot;   It certainly wasn't easy to get shares of Callaway Golf,maker of the Big Bertha club, which went public last week at$20. Trading as ELY on the New York Stock Exchange, the stockopened at 36 and ended at 32 3/8 Friday.   Ely Callaway, chairman and chief executive officer, saidmuch of the buying came from small investors who are golfers.Skeptics on the stock noted that Mr. Callaway and his biggestbacker, General Electric Pension Trust, sold 1.8 millionshares in the offering. Both Mr. Callaway and GE make clearin the company's offering prospectus that they may sell therest of their stakes within a year. &quot;It's not ideal when yousee the founder and a big investor cashing in on the initialsale,&quot; says Leo Grohowski, managing director, equityinvestments, at Marinvest.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Over-the-counter stocks closed mixed after subsiding fromearly gains.
