On signal, they stood up and fired three shots each into the mass of birds, most of which took to the air as soon as the first shots were fired. A ninth man recalls the outcome:    &quot;The flock was enormous -- there must have been ten thousand geese. Some were dead, some were flopping around, and cripples were falling out of the sky as far as the eye could see.&quot;    The death toll: 168, more than four times Louisiana's legal limit of five geese per hunter per day.    This wasn't a scene from a distant, presumably crueler age. It took place only a few months ago and was openly photographed with a video camera by the ninth man -- an agent of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, David Hall. Mr. Hall had duped the eight into taking him along as &quot;an outdoor writer,&quot; and he has filed a variety of poaching charges against them.    Wildlife poaching, say those fighting the practice, has reached epidemic proportions. &quot;I've been in the business 21 years,&quot; says Terry Grosz, the Fish and Wildlife Service's assistant director for enforcement in the Rocky Mountains region, &quot;and I've never seen the situation so bad.&quot;    While exceeding a kill limit is a common form of poaching, the term also is applied to other kinds of illegal hunting and fishing -- hunting after the season is over, for example, or on parkland where the quarry is protected, or with illegal equipment such as aircraft or spotlights. But whatever form poaching may take, the main motive seems to be profit.    One factor that encourages poaching is the high value that the public puts on wildlife trophies. Montana, which doesn't have a bighorn-sheep season, auctions off one permit annually to hunt one bighorn. This year the high bid was $91,000.    Just part of an animal can bring in a great deal of money, and not only in the fur trade: Feathers are in demand for souvenir war bonnets; antlers are used extensively in home decoration. So when wildlife-law enforcers set up sting operations -- running phony stores and letting it be known that they are in the market for poachers' wares -- they are often flooded with offerings.    &quot;It's everything,&quot; says Mr. Grosz, &quot;meat, fish, feathers, cactus, antlers, fur, birds of prey. The day will come when they offer us a human.&quot;    Enforcers sometimes fear they are losing the war, but they win many battles:    --Forty-eight persons were arrested in connection with illegal guided hunts, many in Yellowstone National Park, for deer, elk and bighorn sheep. The guides' fees ranged as high as $20,000, for a large bighorn. &quot;Poachers,&quot; Mr. Grosz says, &quot;are wiping out what is genetically the best, the pool of the biggest and strongest animals.&quot;    --Nine people were prosecuted in west Texas after they were caught shooting deer from a helicopter. The $60,000 helicopter was confiscated.    --A pilot in east Texas was found guilty of using an aircraft to chase waterfowl from a game refuge toward the blinds of a hunting club.    Most people probably think of a poacher as a poor backwoodsman who bags a little extra game for his family. In fact, poaching, which occurs in all states, now often involves big money, marketing outlets and top-notch equipment. The following is a look at some Louisiana poachers and at one man's efforts to turn the tide:    Hard-Core Professional   Woodrow &quot;Tommy&quot; Bagwell has been poaching for more than 25 years and is popularly known as &quot;the best outlaw in Morgan City.&quot; Now 41 and fresh from a nine-month stint in prison, the burly redhead, dressed in blue coveralls and red cap, stands in the warm sunshine of a Morgan City welding yard and tells his history.    At 15, hunting with a spotlight in the Louisiana bayous, he killed more than 100 rabbits a night and sold them for $1 each. &quot;I was making more money than my daddy made working at a job at a tool company and I'm talking about hard work,&quot; he says. &quot;It was nothing to go to school with $200 in my pocket.&quot;    Summers he turned to poaching catfish, stunning them with a shocking device made from an old crank-type telephone. He and two helpers would gather a boatload of up to 2,000 pounds, &quot;unload and come back and hit them again.&quot; He sold them for 35 cents a pound.    But it was when deer became plentiful in the mid-1970s that he really prospered. Cruising the bayous at night with a spotlight and a .22 rifle, he would kill deer that had gathered on the high ground along the canals. &quot;I can shoot from a moving boat better than I can from land,&quot; he says. He killed as many as 400 one winter, 80 of them in just five nights, and sold them for $30 to $75 each. &quot;I never could fill all my orders,&quot; he says.    Game wardens were of only minor concern. &quot;I always had a faster boat,&quot; he says, noting that his craft could top 90 miles per hour. And he never hunted a bayou where he didn't know &quot;where every dead-end and submerged log was.&quot; When chased, he ran without lights, except for one spotlight beamed backward to blind the warden.    Mr. Bagwell says he is through with poaching now -- &quot;I'm facing penitentiary time if I'm caught again&quot; -- but he adds: &quot;I haven't done anything I'm really ashamed of. To me, if I steal from someone, that's bad. But the good Lord put that game out there.&quot;    The Sportsman   The spacious, paneled office of Arlen &quot;Benny&quot; Cenac Jr., the president of Cenac Towing Co., a big Houma tug and barge operator, clearly evidences his interest in ducks. Old duck decoys fill several corner shelves, and paintings of ducks decorate the walls. A member of one of the oldest and wealthiest families in Terrebonne Parish, Mr. Cenac leases 30,000 acres of a beautiful antebellum plantation, primarily for duck hunting for himself, friends and a hunting business venture.    It sounds like a good life that doesn't need poaching to add spice to it. Yet last December, Mr. Cenac was arrested for poaching when he and a friend were caught with 14 ducks over the daily limit. &quot;I've always shot over the limit,&quot; he says. &quot;I've been taught since I was four years old to do it that way.&quot;    In fact, it was difficult to break himself of the habit even after he was caught. &quot;I'd kill the limit,&quot; he says, &quot;then put the guns in the boat and push it off from the blind,&quot; lest he be tempted to shoot more ducks before his pickup boat came along.    While Mr. Cenac's poaching seems mild next to Mr. Bagwell's, many game wardens contend that sportsmen who poach are the biggest threat to wildlife &quot;because there are so many more of them.&quot;    The River Rat   A husky man of perhaps 50, with rotted, tobacco-stained teeth, he leans on the railing of his shack standing on stilts on the banks of the Mississippi River. He doesn't know that one of the two men passing the time with him, someone he has seen several times before, is a federal wildlife agent. On prior visits he has sold the agent the meat of deer and other animals he has poached.    He grew up here, as his father did before him. He figures that he and his wife and their teen-age son survive on $75 a month. The man, who refers to himself as &quot;a river rat,&quot; gets the money by selling wild game and fish, most of it caught illegally. &quot;I'll never starve,&quot; he says with a toothy smile. &quot;If things get bad enough, it wouldn't bother me to blow away a man and take his money.&quot;    The Warden   The popular TV image of a game warden, overweight, uniformed and floundering vainly through a swamp in pursuit of a charming lawbreaker, is badly outdated.    Uniformed state wardens are still widely used to patrol hunting areas, check fishing licenses and otherwise show the badge, but the pursuit of poachers is increasingly handled by plainclothed state and federal wardens like Mr. Hall, the federal government's $50,000-a-year senior agent in charge of Louisiana. A slouching six-footer with a pleasant drawl and an outgoing manner, and generally clad in blue jeans, rubber boots and a hunting cap, the 49-year-old Southerner blends easily with the rural landscape and its people.    While he has deftly handled some violent encounters, that isn't his style. &quot;I don't believe in hot-rod law enforcement -- I'm not going to chase a poacher 90 miles an hour at night in a bayou where he knows every submerged log and hiding place,&quot; he says. &quot;I prefer to get in business with him.&quot; Mr. Hall, a 25-year veteran of federal wildlife service, was a pioneer in the now widely used phony-business operation to break up poaching rings.    In the early 1980s, after Russia complained of headless walruses washing up on its shores, he persuaded a friend with a New Orleans antique shop to let him use it as a front in a sting operation that broke up a poaching ring dealing in Alaskan-walrus ivory. More recently, he and other undercover agents bought truckloads of illegally netted crappies, a game fish, in Louisiana and trucked them to Chicago, Memphis and St. Louis, nabbing both the poachers and the stores selling the illegal fish.    As evidence of poachers' effect, Mr. Hall cites alligators. They were scarce in the 1960s but rebounded after Mr. Hall and other undercover agents broke up several rings of alligator-hide buyers. Now alligators are so plentiful that they are widely hunted legally. &quot;Of course, habitat is the No. 1 factor for wildlife,&quot; Mr. Hall says. &quot;But habitat declined for the alligator. The thing that brought the alligator back was law enforcement.&quot;    He laments a lack of men and money to enforce wildlife laws -- the Fish and Wildlife Service has a mere 188 agents for all the U.S., Puerto Rico, Guam and Wake Island -- but believes that the main long-run need is to change the public's attitude that poaching is socially acceptable. &quot;Managing wildlife is simple; managing man is the complicated part,&quot; he says.    While stronger laws and tougher judges are helping, Mr. Hall says, he considers education critical. To that end, he teaches a class at Mississippi State University -- Wildlife and Man -- in which he uses films of poachers in action.    &quot;Protecting wildlife isn't a job with me,&quot; Mr. Hall says. &quot;It's a religion.&quot; Once he arrested one of his best friends. The friend, who admits he had 30 ducks (six times the limit) in his boat and who insists on anonymity, recalls:    &quot;As soon as I saw Dave Hall, I knew I'd had it. He has a reputation as a hard-nose, a man who would arrest his own mother if she broke the wildlife laws.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
