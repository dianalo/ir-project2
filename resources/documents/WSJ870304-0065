Although opportunities for new construction generally are on the wane, the communications giant is looking for new projects in order to consolidate its offices around the country, and developers are eager to land such a prestigious tenant.    Like many high-profile corporations, though, ATandamp;T has realized that its leases are often the major factor in whether or not developers get favorable financing for projects. So it is holding formal competitions to choose developer-partners and asking for 50% or more of the ownership of projects. &quot;We're just getting wise to the value of our own lease,&quot; says Gary Decker, vice president of real estate for ATandamp;T's resource management division. &quot;When a developer gets a 20-year commitment from us, he has something that has value.&quot;    THAT'S NO PROBLEM for most developers. Though they once were loath to give any ownership to a tenant, they have few qualms about it today. So they are wooing ATandamp;T ardently. But with major internal reorganizations changing its employment forecasts, ATandamp;T has appeared coquettish at times. In San Francisco, the company withdrew bid invitations it had sent to developers, pending further study of its space needs.    ATandamp;T has moved into projects where it is a partner in Kansas City, Mo., and East Brunswick, N.J. Construction is under way on two other projects, one for a new regional headquarters in Chicago's Loop with Stein andamp; Co. and another in Pleasanton, Calif., with Prudential Insurance Co. of America. Meanwhile, in the north Dallas suburbs, ATandamp;T doesn't want to wait for a new building and instead has gotten joint-venture proposals from owners of five recently completed buildings.    ATandamp;T's most recent competition ended late last year when it chose Landmarks Group, an Atlanta company with a development portfolio of four million square feet, over 15 competitors to build a new regional headquarters on a 12-acre site that ATandamp;T owns in Atlanta's midtown area. ATandamp;T has promised to take 500,000 square feet of space in the project for 15 to 20 years.    Ross Markwardt, an ATandamp;T spokesman in Atlanta, says Landmarks was chosen because &quot;their proposal offered us better economics.&quot; The runner-up, a proposal to relocate ATandamp;T to a downtown site in Harold Barry and John Portman's Peachtree Center, &quot;was not as grand in its vision,&quot; says Mr. Markwardt. Claude Hoopes, senior vice president of Landmarks, says his company was one of the few to propose a mixture of hotel, retail and offices. &quot;Our proposal was well beyond what the competition offered,&quot; he says.    MR. BARRY DECLINES to discuss his failure to land ATandamp;T as a tenant, but associates say he is bitterly disappointed and even met with ATandamp;T's chairman to complain about the selection process and to argue the merits of his downtown location. But some say Mr. Barry faced an uphill fight in attempting to persuade ATandamp;T to move from midtown, which has become the cultural heart of Atlanta with its new High Museum of Art, Symphony Hall and Alliance Theater.    Though the partnership terms are still being negotiated, a Landmarks official says his company's proposal will cost ATandamp;T &quot;several tens of millions of dollars&quot; less than Mr. Barry's. The word among Atlanta developers is that the Landmarks deal will cost ATandamp;T $4 a square foot a year less than the next closest competitor, and local developers are wondering just how Landmarks did it. Jokes one of them: &quot;The buildings must be made out of papiermache.&quot;    ATandamp;T concluded another competition last May for a new headquarters in Chicago's Loop. There, Richard Stein, a dark horse who had only one downtown, high-rise office building to his name, beat out 12 of Chicago's better known developers for ATandamp;T's 650,000 square-foot lease, the largest in the city's history. The first phase of the $600 million, 2.7 million-square-foot project, named ATandamp;T Corporate Center, is already under construction not far from the Sears Tower.    MR. STEIN MADE a herculean effort to win the job after getting a late start in the competition. The initial challenge was to control a large-enough site, a requirement for all bidders. In three weeks of crash negotiations, Mr. Stein gained control of a parcel from the University of Chicago that neighbored property he already controlled. Skidmore, Owings and Merrill designed the 60-story first phase, and Mr. Stein assembled a proposal carefully calculated -- down to the use of a color that he calls &quot;ATandamp;T blue&quot; in the brochure -- to appeal to ATandamp;T executives.    Competitors, who give Mr. Stein high marks for his effort, suggest that a major factor in his getting the job was what he was willing to give up. With ATandamp;T owning more than half the project and the lender also holding a piece, competitors say Mr. Stein could own as little as 15% of the project. &quot;Richie gave up a lot,&quot; says one builder.    That may be so, but other developers say that people should focus on what Mr. Stein will get. Bill F. King of the Landis Group, a New Jersey developer, says his competitors couldn't believe that he was willing to give ATandamp;T 49% ownership of his 840,000 square-foot Tower Center project in East Brunswick, N.J. But, as he says, &quot;Getting half of something is a whole lot better than getting half of nothing.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
