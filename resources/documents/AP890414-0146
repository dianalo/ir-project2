It is not necessary. It is not relevant,''he told a news conference on his return to Israel from a 10-dayvisit to the United States.   Shamir, 73, described his visit as a success and added: ``Thereis an understanding between the U.S. and Israel about ourfour-point peace initiative.''   Shamir met last week with President Bush, who supported Shamir'sidea for elections in the occupied territories but said the UnitedStates could not accept permanent Israeli occupation of the WestBank and Gaza Strip, which Israel seized in the 1967 Middle Eastwar.   Earlier Friday, Israeli sources confirmed a Jerusalem Postreport that a cable with Shamir's proposal was sent to Israeliembassies abroad.   Shamir's plan offers elections to choose representatives fromthe occupied territories to negotiate an interim settlement withIsrael.   In later negotiations on a final status for the territorities,``Israel will be prepared to discuss any option which will bepresented,'' a source quoted the cable as saying. The source spokeon condition of anonymity.   The government statement appeared to leave open the possibilitythat Israel would be willing to consider PLO demands for aPalestinian state despite Israel's stated opposition to suchproposals.   Several West Bank Palestinians have offered a counterproposalthat says residents should elect members of the PLO's PalestineNational Council instead of representatives for talks with Israel,Israel radio and Palestinian sources said.   At a later stage, three of those elected would be nominated tonegotiate a two-year interim agreement with Israel, according tothe reports.   ``Palestinians see Shamir's plan as an attempt to bypass thePLO,'' said Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab. ``But we are readyto consider elections to the (council.) This would neutralize theproblem we have with Shamir's idea.''   The Palestinian plan also calls for partial Israeli armywithdrawal before elections are held under internationalsupervision.   In the last stage, the PLO and Israel would negotiate the finalstatus of the occupied lands in the framework of an internationalpeace conference.   Shamir has rejected international supervision of elections,talks with the PLO and an international conference.   Shamir's peace plan essentially repeats the 1978 U.S.-sponsoredCamp David Accords, which led to peace with Egypt but have beenrejected by the Palestinians because they promise only limitedself-rule. But it adds the elections for Palestinian negotiatingrepresentatives.   Like the Camp David Accords, the new plan would leavenegotiations on the final status of the territories until the thirdyear of a five-year period of autonomy.   The territories are home to 1.7 million Palestinians.</TEXT></DOC>
