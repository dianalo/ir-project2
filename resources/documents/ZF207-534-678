Nicholson, a veteran ofthe computer industry, notes that few people appreciate theproblems caused by hacking.andP;  She claims that current laws cannotbe successfully applied to computer abuse and that the policecould catch many hackers, despite arguments that enforcement ofthe law would be impossible.andP;  Access is far easier to definelegally than information, making the Anti-Hacking Bill a practicalmethod of coping with the legal issues surrounding computer crime.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer HackersComputer CrimesLegal IssuesGreat Britain.

And we wantto make computer evidence admissible in court.andP;  It also tidies up five or sixpieces of legislation, such as the Fraud Act, which are currently coveringelectronically stored data and are stretched so far that holes appear andprosecutions collapse.andM;Q You imply in your press handout that your Private Members Bill wouldn't getpassed.andM;A It won't get through.andP;  It wasn't designed to get through.andP;  But I hope myBill will stimulate debate and get the Government to take up the concept inits own legislation.andP;  My aim is for Government legislation to be broughtabout.andP;  I want a slot in the Queen's Speech for a bill on computer misusethis year.andM;Q Have you had any indication from the Government that they're planning to dothat?andM;A No.andM;Q Noneat all?andM;A I'm trying.andP;  Soon 22 million social security records will be on-fine, andI'm hopeful of unhooking Kenneth Clarke's mind from the White Paper andbringing it to bear on the protection needed in the hospital network.andP;  TheGovemment is rapidly computerizing its own work, and this means thatGovernment information will be accessible on a scale that's never beenpossible before.andM;Q So why hasn't the government promised to introduce its own bill?andM;A This is new ground.andP;  It's really difficult to bridge the ground betweencomputer literate and non-computer literate.andP;  it's a maner of age.andP;  I thinkpeople just don't appreciate the problems and dangers of hacking.andP;  [EmmaNicholson then gave details of a case involving alleged software piracy.andP;  Shedescribed it as hacking, but a letter sent to her by Herbert andamp; Sons, a copyof which she gave to reporters, talked of copying software to computer disksand complained of the financial implications of the lost software.] AH thepolice can do is to charge him with the theft of the floppy disks -with aface value of [Br pound],160,000.andP;  It's a very good example indeed.andP;  The lastclause I got in (to the upcoming Copyright Bill, which will extend thecopyright law to cover software) was designed to foil this kind of activity,but die maximum fine is [Br pound]2 ,000.andP;  It's ludicrous.andM;Q Isn't it more straightforward to increase the penalty on copyright? Themain reason Herbert andamp; Sons seems to be upset is that it has lost valuablesoftware, rather than because tbe software was lost by backing.andP;  I suspectthis raises an issue which a lot of people are concerned about - tbat thereare laws in existence which do cover areas very close to the abuses whichmost concern you A There are no laws in existence to cover this example.andM;Q But there will be in three weeks.andP;  It's a simple extension of the CopyrightAct A It's possible that the new clause I put into the Copyright Bill mightbe of value.andP;  But we don't know yet.andM;The law hasn't been tested, it might not work, and anyway, the fine wouldonly be [Br pound]2,000.andM;Q I think tbe core of a lot of people's anxiety about a backing Bill is tbatwhere you -in proposing your bill -- give examples of damage, it'sextroardinarily close to damage that's covered by existing law.andM;A I hope they will be able to charge under the new Copyright Law, but we'renot sure yet.andP;  I'd argue that this is a good example of how civil damages ofup to [Br pound]2,000 is irrelevant.andM;Q Why can't we increase the level of the civil damages available?andM;A Because there are different levels of charge- ing you can make withdifferent levels of offence within the law.andP;  And a civil bill, which is whatthe Copyright Bill is, can't go above [BR pound]2,000.andM;Q There are existing laws for criminal damage, fraud and, indeed, fortrespass.andP;  Why do we need a specific law to cover that kind of activity withregard to computers?andM;A Because the current laws can't be successfully brought for computer abuse,even in cases where they would be successful if brought with regard to paperrecords.andP;  Laws to recognize that computer systems are different are needed.andO;I would suggest that the computer is a new concept, like the car, and needs anew law.andP;  It would be a lot simpler to use that law rather than to muddlearound and wonder if the laws already in existence will cover a particularcomputer crime.andM;Q Don't you think that tbere are dangers in making computer evidenceadmissible, for the same reason that tape recordings are not admissible?andM;A Yes, of course there are dangers - just as there are dangers in televisionParliament--but I drink we have to use new mechanisms.andP;  It's illogical to sayto companies, as in a sense your magazine says, &quot;But every possible securitydevice you can, including those screens you can only get from GCHQ And whichthey only give to authorized people, and which costs five times more than theoriginal computer, and buy all those software security products which slowdown your machines by ten times,&quot; and to then say, &quot;By the way, we're veryhappy if a hacker breaks in.andP;  We don't think your systems are very valuable.&quot;andM;Q What about the problem of identifying people? It's often said, by the LawCommission working paper, for example, that it would be extremely difficultto track backers down.andM;A just because it's difficult to find a burglar, it doesn't mean that societythinks that burglary is admirable and to be supported.andM;Q Don'tyou tbink that it would bring into disrepute any law which youintroduced?andM;A No.andP;  Having worked with the police on this, I know they could catch enoughvillains to make the law worthwile.andP;  On top of that, I believe that mostpeople me honest, and this law would stop honest people leaving unmeaningmistakes behind them which would damage other people's work.andM;Q So, backing, whether malicious or no( would be an offence underyour Bill?andM;A Yes, and the scale of the fine would depend on the malice of the action.andM;Q I could go to your private office now and read every letter in you desk andfiling cabinet without doing anything illegal.andP;  Wby should material stored onyour computer be any different?andM;A Yes, it would be legal.andP;  The difference I'm suggesting is that the volumeand die value of electronically stored data demands a different approach .andO;If you went into the office and actually destroyed some of the data...andM;Q Of course.andP;  The would be covered by wilful damage which again is...andP;  AWell, it's not covered by wilful damage on computer-held data.andM;Q I suppose my bask anxiety is that you're singling out computers and sayingthem is something special about them and tbe data stored on them.andP;  Theinformation on my PC at home is trivial, but the information stored in thefiling cabinets in your office is very confidential and probably valuable.andO;Why should tbe law protect the first and not the second?andM;A I'm not suggesting that you protect the information.andP;  Information has novalue in law.andP;  I'm suggesting that you protect the integrity of die computersystem.andM;Q So you're creating a kind of trespass against computers and making it acriminal offence.andM;A I'm not sure I'd use those words.andP;  I'm not quite sure what those words meanlegally.andM;Q Well, you're saying it would be an offence to enter a computer system.andM;A Yes .andM;Q That's something tbat doesn't exist in any other area of law, I believe.andM;A It's thought to be necessary.andP;  In more and more Western nations the law iscoming in thick and fast, and if we won't implement such laws we will losecustom to other countries.andM;Q Isn't tbis an argument to do what other countlies bate done - to place avalue on information so tbat if I get access to your information, wherever itis stored, I can be seen as having stolen it.andM;A To bring in a law on information would take the next fifty years.andP;  It wouldmake die bar very rich indeed.andM;Q But tbere is also no correlating law on access.andP;  If I come into your house,for instance...andM;A But there is.andP;  If you come into my house and I want you to go, I can callthe police and get you to go out.andM;Q But companies don't usually discover a hacker while he's backing.andP;  Theyusually find the backer's been in and left and they don't know he's beenthere except by the damage be's caused.andM;A They won't disclose the extent of the damage publicly.andP;  I quite agree withyou that ft's not fair to ask for a law without evidence.andP;  I'm trying to getit out into the public arena.andP;  At the beginning of this century lawyers tooksome time to realize that the motor cn was different from the horse.andM;Interestingly, after laws had been introduced on car misuse, laws on car useappeared - MOTs, licence, and the rest of it.andP;  so the step after this bill oncomputer misuse, will be bills on computer use - standards for computeroperation and software.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
