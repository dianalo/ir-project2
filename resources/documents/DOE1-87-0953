<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-87-0953 </DOCNO><TEXT>The neutrino neutral current excitations of /sup 12/C/sup */ (1/sup +/;T=1; 15.1 MeV) (ISO - vector) and /sup 12/C/sup */ (1/sup +/; T=0; 12.71MeV) (ISO) - Scalar) are investigated within the context of SU(2)/subL/x U(1) electroweak theory of Salam and Weinberg. An effective neutrino-nucleusneutral current interaction Hamiltonian is constructed in the ImpulseApproximation (I.A.). The variation of the total cross-section for theIso-vector transition with the Weinberg angle is studied. The recoilpolarization is evaluated. The effect of the (strong) Iso-spin mixingon the /sup 12/C/sup */ (1/sup +/; 12.71 MeV) excitation is examined.</TEXT></DOC>
