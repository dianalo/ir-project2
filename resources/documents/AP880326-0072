Acting Foreign Minister Zain Noorani said that since anotheroutstanding issue _ that of a transitional government _ appears tohave been resolved in principle, ``we feel that as soon as the twoguarantors resolve the issue of symmetry, the instruments can besigned.''   By ``symmetry,'' he was referring to Washington's position thatit would be a guarantor of a settlement only if the Soviet Unionstops military aid to the Kabul government at the same time theUnited States ceases military aid to the Moslem guerrillas fightingthe government.   The Soviets have rejected that demand as amounting tointerference with relations between two sovereign states bound byinternational treaties.   The Washington Post reported Saturday that the Reaganadministration is cutting off its supply of Stinger anti-aircraftmissiles to the Afghan resistance but is rushing at least $300million in other weapons to them before an agreement is reached.   The Post cited diplomatic and other U.S. sources, who were notidentified. It said the decision to stop supplying Stingersapparently was reached late last month in anticipation of a peacesettlement in Afghanistan.   Among the U.S.-purchased military equipment being rushed to theresistance are 120mm Spanish heavy mortars and modern mine-clearingweapons, the Post said.   Noorani, briefing reporters, said the Soviet Union is notprepared to stop or suspend aid to Kabul. ``It seeks the unilateralright to continue to supply arms to the Peoples Democratic Party ofAfghanistan.''   He said ``a Soviet willingness to assume equal and reciprocalobligations as a guarantor can clinch the Geneva agreements and apolitical settlement of the Afghan problem.''   Noorani said Pakistan has told U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez``that the texts of the four instruments (of an agreement) are nowcomplete and that Pakistan does not seek any amendments or changesor modifications in the drafts.''   He noted that the issue of a transitional government appeared tohave been resolved following last week's meeting between Secretaryof State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze.   Pakistan has insisted during the talks that a broad-basedtransitional government would be needed in Afghanistan to ensurepeace in the country following the withdrawal of the estimated115,000 Red Army troops. Moscow had balked, saying this was outsidethe scope of the peace talks.   But a U.S. official said in Washington on Thursday that Moscowhad indicated support for having Cordovez act in a personalcapacity to promote an intra-Afghan dialogue.   In a related development, diplomatic sources said that NicolayKozyrev, the special Soviet envoy who has followed the talks fromthe wings since the latest round began March 2, met NooraniSaturday to brief him on the Shultz-Shevardnadze talks.   The U.N.-sponsored talks are due to resume Monday, following aweekend recess.</TEXT></DOC>
