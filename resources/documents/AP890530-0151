But as long as we haven't reached an impasse, we'llcontinue to negotiate.''   Leaders on both sides hope to avoid a repeat of the bitter 1984hotel strike that left workers off the job for 75 days and affectedthe city's lifeblood tourism industry.   Negotiating teams made a breakthrough Friday night when theunion reached an agreement with six major hotels. The six signed anagreement similar to a pact signed earlier this month with theGolden Nugget Hotel and Casino.   Officials at the six hotels say the new contract will cost them$250 million over five years.   Twenty-four other hotels still must continue negotiating. Themain issue is wages.   The new contract with the six resorts covers 10,000 workers,about one-third of the union's membership. Union members will voteon the contract Wednesday.   The six hotels signing Friday were Caesars Palace, Bally's, theFlamingo Hilton, the Las Vegas Hilton, the Tropicana and CircusCircus.   The contract calls for a $1.25 hourly increase spread over thefive years of the agreement, along with a 95-cent-an-hour increasein contributions to the health and welfare fund.</TEXT></DOC>
