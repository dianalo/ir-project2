Mahmood, a commander in the radical Hezb-I-Islami guerrillafaction, made the claim as the first of an estimated 6,000 Sovietsoldiers left Jalalabad, a strategic city in northeasternAfghanistan 45 miles west of the Pakistan border.   The Soviet troops are reportedly being replaced by up to 12,000soldiers from the Afghan army.   ``There will be a lot of army there. It will need a lot ofpressure,'' Mahmood said.   He said he had 10,000 men under his command near the city butcould not predict when Jalalabad, the heavily fortified capital ofNangarhar province, would be in rebel hands.   He explained that the city is surrounded by land mines, canalsand rivers.   ``Some Mujahedeen cannot swim,'' Mahmood said with a sheepishgrin.   Mujahedeen, or holy warrior, is a term the rebels use todescribe themselves. They have been fighting the Soviet-backedcommunist government in Kabul for 10 years.   Mahmood said his fighters would make full use of anti-aircraftweapons to shoot down Soviet and Afghan helicopters as theyevacuate Soviet troops or resupply Kabul troops.   The rebels claimed they shot down two Soviet MI-24 helicoptergunships over Jalalabad on Friday.   Accompanied by district commander Zurabgul Khomainy, Mahmoodsaid his fighters, in coordination with three other parties ofrebel fighters, would concentrate first on the security postssurrounding Jalalabad, then work on clearing mines.   The United States, a major arms supplier to the guerrillas, hasrecently sent them sophisticated mine-clearing devices. As withother commanders, Mahmood would not be specific about which weaponshis men possess but described their supply situation as ``less thanwe wish.''   Over the past month, the rebels reportedly have overrun dozensof security posts in eastern Afghanistan as Soviet forces handedthem over to Kabul troops.   ``The morale of the Mujahedeen is very good, but the morale ofthe Kabul army is weak now,'' said Mahmood.   The rebel forces recently proposed a limited amnesty to Afghanregulars, saying that any troops who surrender within four weeks ofthe Soviets' withdrawal will not be tried for war crimes.   The fall of Jalalabad would be a major blow to Afghan PresidentNajib in his effort to keep his Marxist government in power afterthe Soviet withdrawal.   Under terms of an accord signed in Geneva in April, all Soviettroops must be out of Afghanistan in nine months.   Pakistan is a conduit of arms to the guerrillas and serves astheir headquarters. It also shelters about 3.5 million war refugees.</TEXT></DOC>
