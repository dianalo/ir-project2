They waited in lines for food, fortelephones, for the chance to pick through second-hand clothing.   They were tired and dirty. Men and women clung to small bagsthat held their only belongings. Crying children clutched stuffedtoys.   But for the thousands of East Germans who flooded into thisborder town Thursday, the chaotic and crowded surroundings of a Hoftrain station brought only joy, pure and unbridled.   Their grueling, sometimes harrowing trip to freedom was amemory. This was paradise.   ``We left the car in Prague, but who cares?'' said GuidoAlbrecht, 26, who fled with his wife, Kerstin, 28. ``The main thingis that we're here,''   Trains carrying 7,600 East Germans arrived here, bringing thesecond wave of a historic refugee exodus. They had fled theirhomeland into Czechoslovakia, seeking asylum at the West GermanEmbassy in the capital there.   East Germany grudingly agreed to let them go, but first they hadto travel by trains back through their homeland, so they could beofficially expelled.   Now, they would begin to fashion new lives in West Germany,where they were granted automatic citizenship and welcomed.   Regina Pfeiffer, 23, held the hand of her 4-year-old son,Michael.   ``We decided at the last moment to go to Prague. We left onTuesday morning and got through just before they imposed the travelrestriction,'' to Czechoslovakia, the former Erfurt resident said.   ``I was so tired but I kept on thinking about my son.''   East Germany agreed to this exodus Tuesday, then closed theborder with Czechoslovakia, the only nation East Germans couldtravel to without government permission.   Mrs. Pfeiffer's husband, Stefan, also 23, said ``We reallydidn't have much time to think. There was speculation at home thatthey may close the Ceczhoslovak border.''   Pfeiffer, a construction worker, said he didn't know where thefamily would end up in West Germany. ``Maybe we'll go toRhineland-Pfalz,'' he said jokingly. Rhineland-Palz is the Germanname for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's home state of RhinelandPalatinate.   Most of the refugees are in their 20s and 30s. Most say theywere dissatisfied with East Germany's hard-line Communist system.   Red Cross workers, shivering in the freezing dawn, spooned outhot goulash and soup, and poured tea and coffee for the refugees,the first hot meal for most of them since Wednesday noon inCzechoslovakia.   Among the refugees where at least 1,000 young children, lookingdazed and bewildered by the commotion in the Hof train station.Many were crying, tightly hugging teddy bears and other stuffedtoys.   Many of the refugees, hugging each other, some crying and otherssmiling broadly, waited in long lines for telephones to callrelatives in West Germany and East Germany.   Most of the East Germans in this northern Bavarian town were puton other trains within an hour of their arrival Thursday fortransport to refugee centers in other parts of West Germany.   Hundreds of them, dazed and exhausted, sipped beverages handedthem as they waited to leave for the centers.   Most of them carried only hand baggage with their entirebelongings. Many were dressed in blue jeans and other lightclothing unsuited for the chilly weather.   Some sorted through clothing stacked high on yellow railwaycarts by the Red Cross workers, looking for something warm to wear.Others told of how they fled their Communist homeland.   The Albrechts, who came from Potsdam, said they crossed theborder just an hour before the East German government closed theborder with Czechoslovakia.   ``It was hell on the train. It was crowded and even some of thechildren had to stand in the corridors where it was bitterlycold,'' he said.   ``But now I think it was worth it.''</TEXT></DOC>
