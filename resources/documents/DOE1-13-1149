In order to quantitatively study the coalliquefaction process, and its unit process a simulator was developedand tested. 1) System analysis for establishment of evaluation methods;Development of model for complex tower distillation calculation, studyof liquefaction characteristics based on liquefaction reaction model,comparative study with solvent hydrogenation experiment data, were carriedout. And further, study of feed stock properties and recovery rates,solvent circulation systems, hydrogen circulation systems and middleoil mixing system were executed. Thereby, characteristics of processeswere grasped. 2) Development of software for liquefaction process simulator;Consistency of the system was verified and simulator test and users'manual were prepared and the liquefaction simulator was installed.
