(products).andO;Product:   Fontographer 3.0 (Computer program).andO;Topic:     Graphics SoftwareFontsEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Fontographer 3.0andM;Fontographer has long been the only game in town if you wanted to create yourown downloadable PostScript fonts.andP;  When introduced in 1986, it was animpressive achievement -- even with the nasty drawback of copy protection.andM;Altsys has now released a major new version of Fontographer, version 3.0.andO;The package and manual have been completely redone, a few major features havebeen added, and scores of minor improvements have been made.andP;  There's hardlya dialog box that hasn't been touched up at least a little.andM;WHAT IT ISandM;Originally, Altsys positioned Fontographer purely as a font generator.andP;  Now,in trying to reach a wider audience, Altsys is placing more emphasis on thelogos and graphics you can create in specialty fonts with the program --although their tools are pretty meager.andM;In any case, Fontographer 3.0 keeps the basic look and feel of the earlierversions, with the straightforward ability to edit or create designs in anyof the 256 character slots of any PostScript font you choose.andP;  Using Beziercontrol points, you design the characters and then have the program createboth the downloadable PostScript font and the screen fonts.andP;  You install thefonts in the normal way.andM;Foremost among the new features are an integrated screen-font editor,auto-tracing, and a pen tool (the latter is similar to those in FreeHand andIllustrator 88).andM;The integrated screen-font editor is a great convenience in serious fontproduction.andP;  In the old days, Fontographer generated rough-and-readybit-mapped screen fonts, but you couldn't edit them (and they often neededediting) without switching to another program.andP;  Unfortunately, Altsysprovides only a bare-bones bit-map editor in the new Fontographer.andP;  You get apenctil tool and a grabber, and that's it -- barely enough to get by.andM;With the new auto-tracing feature, you can paste background images into acharacter cell and then have Fontographer trace it for you -- providingpoints, curves, and fills as needed.andP;  This is a colossal time-saver if youwant to convert a number of scanned images into PostScript.andM;The welcome pen tool conveniently combines the capabilities of tangent,corner, and curve tools into one.andP;  It relieves you of continually having toswitch tools -- something earlier versions made you do a lot.andP;  It seems odd,though, that Altsys, the developer of FreeHand, decided not to include afreehand drawing tool in the Fontographer program.andM;HOW IT WORKSandM;Version 3.0 adds many features that increase productivity, such as morekeyboard shortcuts, optional snap-to guidelines, better printing options, andno more copy protection.andM;Fontographer has always been a professional tool, capable of sophisticatedjobs such as creating kerning tables and building composite fonts based onfonts already in your printer.andP;  In keeping with this heritage, version 3.0adds the feature of including PostScript &quot;hints&quot; in your fonts, which canimprove the look of your fonts when you print them on 300-dpi printers insmall point sizes.andM;Overall, the new version is worth the upgrade, even though there's still roomfor improvement (especially in beefing up the bit-map editor).andP;  Although themanual is improved in this version, it still suffers from a poor index,typos, and several confusing illustrations.andP;  Finally, if Altsys seriouslywants buyers to use Fontographer for graphics, it needs to include betterdrawing tools, including a freehand drawing tool and shape tools such asboxes.andP;  Considering Altsys' history as FreeHand's developer, these areglaring omissions.andM;FontographerandM;List Price: $495; upgrade, $70.andM;Published by: Altsys, 720 Avenue F, Suite 109, Plano, TX 75074; (214)424-4888.andM;Version: 3.0.andM;Requires: System 4.2 and Finder 6.0 or later.andM;Application Size: 394K.andM;Compatibility: Mac Plus or later.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
