Ltd. and Sony Corp. were the firstcompanies to ship production volumes of rewritable optical disk drives.andP;  Sonyhas taken an early lead in unit shipments and market share.andP;  Canon sells mostof its drives to Next Inc. for integration into the Next workstations.andM;Ahost of other companies have just begun, or will soon begin, volumeshipments of OEM-level drives.andP;  They include Hitachi America Ltd., LaserdriveLtd., Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd., Maxoptix Corp., MitsubishiElectric Corp. and Sharp Corp.andP;  Most of the drives are compatible withstandards developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO), andall drives come in the 5-1/4-inch form factor (although Laserdrive hasannounced a 3-1/2-inch product).andM;Optical vs.andP;  opticalandM;The main advantage of rewritable over write-once optical is, of course,rewritability.andP;  &quot;I don't like write once read many [WORM] because it's awrite-once media.andP;  That's fine for archiving but not for medium to long-termstorage where you have to retrieve and modify files,&quot; states Ray Kocian.andP;  Heis an engineer at an Randamp;D facility of Schlumberger.andM;Kocian chose subsystems from Epoch Systems Inc. that combine hard magneticdisk drives and Hitachi rewritable optical drives in a jukeboxconfiguration--an increasingly common configuration for optical drives.andP;  AndKocian uses the subsystems for storing data and image files from the seismicanalysis applications.andM;Now that rewritable optical drives are available, most observers see writeonce optical as strictly archival devices in applications wherenon-erasability is a plus.andP;  &quot;Write once is being displaced by rewritable andrelegated to an archive functionality,&quot; says Mike Peterson, president ofmarket-researcher Peripheral Strategies Inc., Santa Barbara, Calif.andM;In fact, some researchers, such as Disk/Trend Inc., Mountain View Calif.,andO;predict that shipments of rewritable drives could eclipse shipments of writeonce drives as early as this year.andM;Still, for applications that don't require rewritability, write once opticalhas an advantage over rewritable optical: lower cost.andP;  Currently, rewritabledrives cost about twice as much, on a cost-per-megabyte basis, as write oncedrives.andM;Standards for rewritable optical drives are further along than those forwrite once drives.andP;  If cartridge interchangeability is a key requirement,check for ISO standards compliance when evaluating rewritable optical drives.andM;At the same time, bear in mind that standards compliance does not guaranteeinterchangeability.andP;  So far, it's too early to tell what level ofinterchangeability manufacturers will be able to achieve.andM;But write once drives aren't the only alternative to rewritable opticaldrives.andP;  For some applications, rewritable optical must compete withtraditional hard disk drives (Winchesters), which are still considerablyfaster.andM;For example, the average access times for 5-1/4-inch Winchesters are under 20milliseconds, compared to 60 to 100 milliseconds for most rewritable opticaldrives.andP;  (Maxoptix, however, claims 35-millisecond average access times forits Tahiti rewritable optical drives).andM;Upshot: If speed is your key requirement, Winchesters are still your bestsolution.andP;  If media removability is more important, go with optical drives.andM;&quot;We went with rewritable because we needed portable [removable] media andsmall size,&quot; says Mark Frankie, VAX systems manager at Northern Telecom.andP;  Ituses rewritable optical subsystems from Alphatronix--based on Sonydrives--for backing up Digital Equipment Corp. MicroVAXes.andM;In addition, rewritable optical drives are less expensive and, atmultigigabyte capacities, take up less space than Winchesters.andP;  &quot;Winchestersare too expensive and too big,&quot; says John Willoughby, group manager of CAE atStratus Computer Inc.andP;  Stratus uses Epoch rewritable subsystems for on-linestorage of CAD/CAM files.andP;  The Stratus' jukebox configuration currentlyhandles 5G bytes of data storage.andP;  (Stratus does not resell the Epochsubsystems with its fault-tolerant computers.)andM;Optical vs.andP;  tapeandM;Tape drives are another option for data storage and retrieval.andP;  And there areplenty of tape technologies to choose from, including half-inch andquarter-inch tape cartridge drives, 4mm digital audio tape (DAT) and 8mmhelical-scan tape drives.andP;  However, all tape technologies share a glaringdrawback: They're slow.andM;&quot;I've used tape and it's too slow,&quot; says John Mir, production manager for themusical group The Oak Ridge Boys.andP;  &quot;The speed of rewritable, although not asgood as Winchesters, was better than any other backup medium.&quot;andM;Mir opted for rewritable optical disk subsystems from Relax TechnologyInc.--which are based on Ricoh drives--as backup devices on a network ofApple Computer Inc. Macintoshes.andP;  The drives store basic business files suchas word processing documents and spreadsheets.andM;The average access times for rewritable optical drives are measured inmilliseconds.andP;  Compare that to tape technologies:andM;* Quarter-inch cartridge--30 to 40 seconds;andM;* Half-inch cartridge--24 to 44 seconds;andM;* 4mm DAT--20 seconds.andM;Furthermore, transfer rates for rewritable optical drives are faster thanthose for most tape cartridge drives.andM;Caution: Don't take speed specifications as gospel.andP;  Actual backup times willvary, depending on configurations.andM;For example, Kocian reports that backing up data on Epoch rewritablesubsystems takes about twice as long as backing up on 8mm helical-scan tapedrives from Exabyte Corp.andM;Kocian does not see rewritable optical and 8mm tape as competingtechnologies.andP;  &quot;We use rewritable optical for maintaining user files and weuse the Exabyte drives strictly for backing up Sun [Microsystems Inc.]andO;workstations and the Epoch subsystems.&quot;andP;  Kocian says he plans to continue touse both technologies.andM;Magneto optics vs.andP;  phase changeandM;There are three methods of producing rewritable optical media: magneto optic,phase change and dye polymer.andP;  Most drives currently use magneto-optictechnology.andP;  Phase-change media is expected to be the second generation ofrewritable optical media and is due out sometime in 1991.andP;  Dye-polymer mediais still in its early development stages.andM;1.andP;  Magneto-optic technology uses a magneto-optic sensitive (recording) layerconsisting of an amorphous alloy of rare earth elements.andP;  To record data, thelaser beam hits the sensitive layer and the layer's magnetic field changespolarity.andP;  A lower power beam of the same laser then reads the information asbinary codes.andM;Erasing data requires three steps: one to erase, a second to write newinformation onto the disk and a third to verify the new information.andM;According to Dave Berry, manager of new product development at media-makerMaxell Corp. of America, the main advantage of magneto-optic media is longlife.andP;  Maxell, for example, has tested its magneto-optic media at 7 millionwrite-erase cycles without degradation.andM;Disk manufacturer Philips and Du Pont Optical Co, also comments.andP;  In contrastto phase change and dye polymer, data written using magneto-opticaltechnology is permanent unless intentionally erased.andP;  And there is no actualphysical change to the media.andM;Most magneto-optic media manufacturers claim a media life of 10 years.andM;2.andP;  Phase-change technology is another approach to rewritable optical media.andO;In the phase-change technique, a laser beam changes the structure of asensitive layer from a stable amorphous state to a crystalline state.andP;  Thesurface reflectivity changes from low to high, and the laser beam reads thereflection from the crystalline surface as positive or negative.andP;  To erasedata, the laser beam changes the sensitive layer back to the stable amorphousstate.andM;According to Maxell, phase-change media lasts about as long as magneto-opticmedia.andP;  But unlike magneto-optic, phase-change media permits directoverwriting (i.e.andP;  you don't have to erase before you rewrite).andM;Phase-change media is less expensive than magneto-optic media but not ascheap as dye-polymer media.andM;Matsushita electric Industrial Co. Ltd. has shipped phase-change drives inJapan, but no one has shipped these drives in the United States.andM;3.andP;  Dye polymer is a process in which the laser beam's heat changes thetopology of the disk surface.andP;  The laser beam creates a small rise--orbump--on the surface of the sensitive layer.andM;The bump scatters the light, resulting in less reflection than on the flatsurface.andP;  To erase data, the beam reduces the bump.andM;Main advantage: Least expensive method of producing rewritable optical media.andO;However, media life is still relatively low at a few hundred thousandwrite-erase cycles.andP;  No manufacturers are shipping dye-polymer systems yet.andM;For now, media manufacturers are concentrating on magneto-opticandM;What's in the future for rewritable optical?andP;  &quot;Sony's goal is to bringrewritable performance up to that of Winchesters in the next five to 10years,&quot; says Robert Mueller, vice president and general manager of Sony'sRewritable Optical Products Division.andM;Key future event: IBM Corp. is working on 3-1/2-inch and 5-1/4-inchrewritable optical drives.andP;  Big Blue's entry will provide a strong shot inthe arm for rewritable optical technology.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
