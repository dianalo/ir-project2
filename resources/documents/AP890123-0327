(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co.reported Monday that its fourth-quarter profit jumped 25.7 percentfrom a year earlier.   The diversified manufacturer said it earned $272 million, or$1.21 a share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, up from $216 million,or 95 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.   Fourth-quarter revenue grew 8.6 percent, to $2.57 billion from$2.37 billion a year earlier.   For all of 1988, annual profit topped $1 billion for the firsttime, 3M said.   Earnings for 1988 rose to $1.15 billion, or $5.09 a share, upfrom the previous record of $918 million, or $4.02 a share, in 1987.It was the largest increase in 12 years and came on record revenueof $10.58 billion, 12.2 percent higher than 1987's $9.42 billion,the company said.   Allen F. Jacobson, chairman and chief executive officer, saidimproved overseas sales contributed to the record year. In addition,more than 30 percent of sales in 1988 came from products introducedwithin the last five years, he said.   ``Our earnings now have increased nearly 75 percent in the lastthree years,'' Jacobson said in a statement. ``Sales are up 35percent over the same period.''   Jacobson said 3M also increased research and development spending10 percent to $689 million, or 6.5 percent of sales.   The company benefited from a lower tax rate and weaker dollar,Jacobson said. The lower price of the dollar in overseas salescontributed an estimated $46 million, or 20 cents a share, to 1988earnings, he said.   ``We look for economic growth to moderate and inflation toaccelerate slightly,'' Jacobson said. ``In addition, strengtheningof the U.S. dollar could result in slightly negative currencyeffects.''</TEXT></DOC>
