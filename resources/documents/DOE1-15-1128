In particular, the optimization of signal tonoise (S/N) ratio for devices having low and high tunnel probability(p) versus the bath temperature (T) and the front-end electronics usedi.e. voltage and charge amplifier has been analyzed and discussed. Calculationshave been done about the intrinsic recombination time versus T for someconventional superconducting materials. It was found the time for whichthe maximum of the voltage signal from STJ versus p and T occurs. Itis shown that for a charge amplifier coupled to the STJ the S/N ratioindefinitely increases decreasing T.</TEXT></DOC>
