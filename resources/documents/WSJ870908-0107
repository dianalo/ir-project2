In June, a contract was dissolved that would have forced the natural gas producer to sell one trillion cubic feet of natural gas to its former parent company at below-market prices. And, after a series of losses from mid-1986 through the first quarter of this year, Anadarko turned a profit in the second quarter. The company now predicts that it will post a profit for the third quarter and for the year.    &quot;Now we have control of our gas and can sell it to whom we want at prices we want,&quot; says Robert J. Allison Jr., chairman. &quot;That's one of our biggest assets -- if not our biggest.&quot;    But with more control than ever over its corporate destiny, Anadarko is confronted with hard, new decisions. The choices it makes may well decide if the company can preserve its distinction as one of Wall Street's most darling energy stocks.    For example, Anadarko is considering whether to join the list of energy companies that have grown by acquisition. &quot;The company has shown it can grow internally,&quot; Mr. Allison said. An oil producer would be a likely target, he said, because natural gas comprises 94% of Anadarko's reserves.    As for continuing the hunt for new discoveries of oil and gas, Anadarko is wrestling with a difficult dilemma: whether to take advantage of the lowest drilling costs in years or to be content, for the time being, with its existing reserves. &quot;We have good prospects out there,&quot; Mr. Allison said. &quot;We'd like to find the funding to do it, but we don't necessarily want to borrow to explore.&quot;    Anadarko, unlike much of the oil patch, has the luxury of options because it's sitting on tremendous reserves in relation to its size: 1.7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, of which it is currently producing only 200 to 250 million cubic feet a day.    Thanks to the rapid deregulation of the gas markets, Anadarko could sell a whole lot more gas if it wanted. Under a recent order of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Anadarko was permitted to free gas from existing low-priced sales contracts. At the same time, another FERC order -- the &quot;open access&quot; rule -- allows Anadarko to move gas to new markets on short notice.    &quot;It gives us the potential to expand our customer base in the spot market,&quot; Mr. Allison said.    But in recent quarters, with natural gas prices in the doldrums, Anadarko has willingly impaired its financial results in order to avoid selling its gas on the cheap. The company has a policy of not selling natural gas (except that which it is contractually obligated to sell) for anything less than $1.50 per thousand cubic feet. The top price paid on the spot market so far this month, according to Natural Gas Clearinghouse Inc., was $1.40 per thousand cubic feet.    &quot;It doesn't make sense to give away your assets in the interest of short-term earnings,&quot; Mr. Allison said.    Until recently, in fact, &quot;earnings&quot; was something of a misnomer in Anadarko's case. In a string of three quarters from mid-1986 through the first quarter of this year, Anadarko toted up losses of $1.7 million. But Anadarko returned to profitability in the second quarter. It expects to be &quot;in the black&quot; in the third quarter as well, Mr. Allison says, compared with a loss of $700,000 on $42.1 million in revenue for the year-earlier quarter.    For all of 1987, he adds, the company should turn a profit of between five cents and 30 cents a share. In 1986, it had net income of $10.1 million, or 21 cents a share, on revenue of $205.7 million.    When the gas markets tighten -- an event that the industry has been counting on for years -- Anadarko's huge reserves will serve it well. Since 1973, the natural gas market has shrunk 20%, but reserves have been depleted by 45%. &quot;There is a crisis coming,&quot; Mr. Allison said.    Most analysts agree with his prediction, and say Anadarko is well-positioned to take advantage of a tighter market. &quot;Anadarko's profit should recover moderately this year and climb substantially in 1988-89,&quot; said R.J. Barone of Kidder Peabody Inc. in a report. </TEXT></DOC>
