Box 2511, Houston, Texas, 77252-2511, pursuant to sections7(b) and 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, as amended, and subpart E of Part157 of the Regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission),filed in Docket No. CP89-2048-000 an application for an optional certificateof public convenience and necessity authorizing it to: (1) Construct, own,and operate an interstate natural gas pipeline system commencing at a proposedpoint of interconnection with the facilities of Northwest Pipeline Corporation(Northwest) near Opal, Wyoming, and extending southwestward through a portionof Wyoming and through the states of Utah and Nevada to terminal pointsnear Bakersfield, California; and (2) abandon all or any part of the authorizedfacilities or services Kern River determines are no longer needed uponexpiration of the underlying contracts. In Docket No. CP89-2047-000, undersubpart F of part 157, Kern River requests blanket authority to construct,own and operate appurtenant facilities as necessary to render the authorizedservice, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on filewith the Commission and open to public inspection.Kern River states that its Application is intended to implement provisionsof a settlement agreement with Mojave Pipeline Company (Mojave) and SouthernCalifornia Gas Company (SoCal). The Application provides that Kern Riverwill jointly own with Mojave, as tenants in common, the portion of thepipeline system extending from a point near Daggett, California to theterminal points in Kern County. Kern River states that it has, in connectionwith this Application, concurrently filed an application pursuant to 18CFR 284.221 for a blanket certificate of public convenience and necessityauthorizing self-implementing transportation for others on a non-discriminatorybasis.Kern River states that this application is not intended to supercede inany way Kern River's pending application in Docket No. CP85-552. If theCommission determines that this application and Kern River's previously-filedapplication cannot both remain pending, Kern River requests that the Commissiongive Kern River an opportunity to withdraw either this, or its earlierapplication, in order to permit Kern River to determine which proposalcan best satisfy the needs of its shippers.Kern river is a Texas general partnership and that its principal placeof business is Houston, Texas. It is expalined that the partnership isowned equally by Kern River Corporation, an affiliate of Tenneco Inc.,and Williams Western Pipeline Company, an affiliate of The Williams Companies.Kern River states that the purpose of the pipeline project is to providean efficient natural gas transmission system for transportation of gasfor contract shippers, a major portion of which are anticipated to be heavyoil producers in the Kern County, California area, transporting gas foruse in their enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and cogeneration (Cogen) operations.Kern River states that, based upon discussions with and information obtainedfrom prospective shippers and its own studies, it is satisfied that thereis at least an initial market need, not currently capable of being served,of 700 MMcf per day of gas to support its proposed pipeline system. KernRiver notes that its pipeline system will be available to all shipperswho desire transportation service and who make the necessary arrangementsfor the delivery of gas to Kern River's pipeline. The proposed pipelinewill be well-situated to provide shippers with economical access to abundantsources of reliable gas supplies from the Rocky Mountain Overthrust area,from Canada, and from other sources.Kern River proposes to construct the following pipeline facilities: (1)676.2 miles of 36-inch outer diameter (O.D.) pipeline beginning at a pointof interconnection with Northwest's mainline near Opal, Wyoming, approximately60 miles north of the Utah/Wyoming border, and extending southwestwardthrough Wyoming and across the States of Utah and Nevada, utilizing the``Wasatch Variation'' and the ``North Las Vegas Variation'' to a pointnear Daggett, California, where it will interconnect with Mojave's facilities;(2) 121.5 miles of 42-inch O.D. pipeline which will be jointly owned withMojave, extending from Daggett to a point of bifurcation into two laterials;(3) 104 miles of 36-inch O.D. and 30-inch O.D. pipeline comprising twolines which will be jointly owned with Mojave and which will extend toterminal points in the Kern County oil fields; (4) approximately 35,700site-rated horsepower of compression at three compressor stations, oneat the interconnection with Northwest at milespost 0, one in central Utahat milepost 279 and one in southern Nevada at milepost 568; and (5) taps,valves, metering and other appurtenant facilities.The proposed system will be capable of delivering 700,000 Mcf per day atthe point of interconnection with Mojave's system. The commonly-owned systemwill be capable of receiving up to 700 MMcf/d from Kern River's systemand up to 400 MMcf/d from Mojave's system. Each lateral line will be capableof delivering 400 MMcf/d at its terminus. In addition, the system willhave a delivery point approximately 12.5 miles west of the bifurcationpoint which will be capable of delivering up to 300 MMcf/d at a proposedpoint of interconnection with the facilities of SoCal.  Kern River proposes a transportation service only. Kern River proposesto transport gas for third-party shippers, up to the full capacity of itsproposed system, which is designed to be approximately 700 MMcf per day.Applicant has concurrently filed in Docket No. CP89-2047 an applicationfor a blanket certificate pursuant to subpart G of part 284 of the Commission'sRegulations, to authorize non-discriminatory, self-implementing transportationfor others on its proposed system.  Kern River's proposed tariff incorporates two rate schedules. A firm transportationservice pursuant to Rate Schedule KRF-1, a two-part rate, including a maximumreservation rate and Kern River's Rate Schedule KRI-1, applicable to interruptibleservice, which is a one-part volumetric rate. All rates will be discountablebetween stated maximum and minimum levels.  The total direct and indirect captial cost of Kern River's proposed project,including line pact, and including Kern River's share of the cost of thecommonly-owned facilities, is estimated to be $853,201,000 in 1989 dollars.Kern River proposed to finance its project through a combination of partners'equity contributions and debt, with the initial capitalization ratio of70 percent debt, 30 percent equity.  The route and facilities described in its Application have, with only insignificantexceptions, already been the subject of extensive environmental reviewin the proceedings in Mojave Pipeline Co., Docket No. CP85-437-000, etal., including the preparation of the five-volume Mojave-Kern River-ElDorado Natural Gas Pipeline Projects Final Environmental Impact Report/Statement(FEIS), and the two-volume Supplement to the FEIS, and the proposed systemhas been found by the Commission to be capable of construction in an environmentallyacceptable fashion.
