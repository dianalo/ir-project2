The Office of Technology Assessment warned that thediminishing U.S. share of world trade and the erosion of U.S.living standards are signs that the country is falling behindinternational competitors in manufacturing.</LP><TEXT>   The office specifically faults U.S. trade policy for beingtoo &quot;reactive,&quot; for failing to set &quot;strategic priorities&quot; andfor taking too long to help U.S. industries injured by unfairtrade. If a U.S. industry is in such trouble, the immediateresponse should be to stress domestic relief such as taxbreaks and research-and-development support, rather thanlaunching the more uncertain process of trying to openforeign markets for the U.S. producers, the study says.   Even under current international trade rules, the U.S. canprovide temporary protection for critical industries byraising tariffs on competing imports while lowering duties onless threatening imports, according to the study.   The OTA study was intended to be a bipartisan effort, butit was released by Senate Finance Committee Democrats, whoslammed the Bush administration for being &quot;asleep at theswitch&quot; while the U.S. loses ground to Japan in keyindustries such as semiconductors and computers.   The OTA also recommends improving the overall climate forinvestment in technology by encouraging increased savings andproviding tax breaks and incentives for long-term investors.   More narrowly, it recommends expanding the CommerceDepartment's advanced technology program, which spends $10million a year on grants to companies for research onpromising technologies. The OTA recommends providing thedepartment or a new civilian technology agency with a budgetof $1 billion to $2 billion a year for that effort.   The Bush administration has opposed such direct governmentinvolvement in civilian technological development, arguingthat the government shouldn't pick &quot;winners and losers&quot; fromamong various industries. But the study notes that therealready is a broad consensus in the U.S. about whatindustries are worth nurturing. Several government andprivate agencies have identified software, communicationsequipment, precision machinery, advanced materials, robotics,aerospace and biotechnology as &quot;critical&quot; technologies.   The OTA said the U.S. share of world exports fell to lessthan 13% in 1988 from nearly 16% in 1968. At the same time,the OTA reported, inflation-adjusted hourly wage rates forU.S. workers peaked in 1978 at almost $9.50, and then sank by1990 to almost $8, below their 1964 level.   The White House didn't respond directly to the OTA report.However, administration economists have disputed similaranalyses of U.S. competitiveness. Specifically, they contendchanges in wage rates don't measure other benefits that U.S.workers have gained in recent years, including those relatingto health and retirement.</TEXT></DOC>
