Four members of the group were arrested after they threw bottlesand cement at radicals, the officials said.   Government officials said the action was part of efforts tocomplete a long-delayed expansion of the airport at Narita, 40miles northeast of Tokyo. The airport has only one runway.   Guarded by 6,500 riot police, bulldozers began demolishing ironfences surrounding Sanrizuka Struggle Hall, a two-storyprefabricated headquarters built by local farmers and the extremistgroup Chukakuha, or Middle Core Faction. The group opposes theairport expansion as part of its anti-government campaign.   Four radicals occupying the headquarters defied a governmentorder to leave the building, which is less than a mile from a4,400-yard runway under construction.   The radicals threw bottles and chunks of cement at officials andreporters before police arrested them.   In a statement, airport authority president Kauharu Matsui saidthe demolition of the headquarters ``is very significant for oursmooth negotiations in the future to obtain the land stillnecessary to resume the expansion of the airport, as well for theairport security.''   The government plans to build a new terminal and two additionalrunways by the end of March 1991 to cope with overcrowding at the12-year-old airport.   Of the 2,630 acres of land sought for the expansion project, thegovernment still needs to acquire 52.6 additional acres, including40 acres held by eight farmers who refuse to move, said KaoruShirohata, spokesman for the New International Airport Authority.   The Airport Authority says the airport is handling more than 19million passengers a year, 6 million more than its officialcapacity.</TEXT></DOC>
