The biotechnology company said the test is the first DNA-probe test that employs an easy-to-use color change indicator based on enzymes. Previous DNA-probe tests have required the use of trace amounts of radioactive isotopes to signal the presence of microorganisms.    DNA probes are small pieces of genetic material that stick to and reveal the DNA of specific organisms. The technology allows fast, precise detection of bacteria, but its use by the food industry has been limited because of the radioactive elements previously required. The new enzyme-based test &quot;will open the market immensely&quot; for DNA-probe tests, an Integrated Genetics spokeswoman said.    Integrated Genetics said Gene-Trak plans within the next few months to introduce additional enzyme-based, DNA-probe tests for the presence of Salmonella and Listeria bacteria in food.    Integrated Genetics said the E. coli test will identify the bacteria within 48 hours, compared with up to 10 days for a conventional method. The test also will detect certain strains of E. coli that are missed by conventional tests, the company said. Integrated Genetics said the E. coli test will be priced at $6.25 per test kit.    The presence of E. coli in food indicates fecal contamination. Some strains of the bacteria can cause gastrointestinal illness. </TEXT></DOC>
