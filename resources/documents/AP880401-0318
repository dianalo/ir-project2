Among other things, the tentative compromise reached Thursdaynight calls for retaliation against foreign trade barriers butleaves the president some latitude to waive action if he believedthat would be wiser.   ``The superconference will meet after recess and if substantialchanges aren't made by the superconference, the president's senioradvisers will recommend a veto,'' Fitzwater said, referring tofinal negotiations by House and Senate members to get overallagreement on the legislation.   Earlier, U.S Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the billhas been cleansed of ``a lot of undesirable things'' but that``there certainly are some provisions in there of dubious merit.''   In working through the package, House and Senate negotiatorsscrapped Rep. Richard Gephardt's controversial trade retaliationamendment while opting for repeal of the windfall oil profits tax,tough sanctions on Japan's Toshiba Corp. and a $1 billion boost inU.S. grain export subsidies.   The compromise trade bill completed late Thursday night alsowould require employers to give 60 days' notice of plant closingsand would increase government aid to those left jobless as a resultof competition from imports.   Yeutter, interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, said the plantclosing requirement ``is probably a killer provision'' that couldjustify a veto if not removed before the trade package receivesfinal congressional approval.   ``The Congress jettisoned a lot of undesirable things this lastweek,'' Yeutter said. ``The question is whether they jettisonedenough. And we need a couple of days to assess that.''   The tentative agreement was produced by 17 separate subgroups ofa House-Senate conference committee.   At the heart of the measure are direct trade provisions designedto tightened the machinery under which the United States imposesimport curbs.   Authority to impose restraints in retaliation for foreign tradepractices that violate international trade rules would betransferred from the president to the U.S. trade representative.But the president would still be empowered to waive action undersome circumstances.   The president also would retain his current authority to decidewhat type of restraints to impose to aid U.S. industries threatenedby surges in imports. But the machinery for arriving at a decisionwould be streamlined.   Even as the massive bill moved ahead in Congress, concerns abouta possible presidential veto were growing.   Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., said the plant-closing provisionand several others ``clearly would sink the legislation unless theywere removed.'' The Senate Finance Committee chairman, Sen. LloydBentsen, D-Texas, also expressed uncertainty about whether thepresident would sign the overall package.   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House-Senateconference committee that produced the package, said there wasbound to be some grumbling, but he was upbeat about the finalproduct.   ``We worked long and hard and I think evidence that it's a goodproduct is that nobody's happy about it,'' he said.   At the heart of the measure are streamlined procedures forimposing import restrictions to aid U.S. industries hard hit byimports and retaliate against barriers that trading partners put inthe way of American exports.   Erased in last-minute, one-on-one bargaining betweenRostenkowski and Bentsen was the provision that erstwhileDemocratic presidential contender Gephardt had made the centerpieceof his campaign. It would have required 10 percent annual rollbacksin ``excess and unwarranted'' surpluses that other countries run intrade with the United States.   In its place, Rostenkowski and Bentsen settled on a modifiedSenate alternative that calls on the U.S. trade representative tolist foreign trade barriers and, if necessary, use import curbs toforce their removal.   The bill would transfer from the president to the U.S. traderepresentative authority to impose import restrictions inretaliation for unfair foreign trade practices. But it still wouldleave room to waive the curbs if the cost ``would be substantiallyout of proportion to the benefits of action.''   The president would retain the authority to decide what importrelief to grant to U.S. industries hit hard by surges in imports.   The bill would repeal the windfall profits tax on oil companies,a measure approved by Congress in 1979 when petroleum prices weresurging.   The collapse of OPEC sent prices plummeting in 1985, hammeringthe Texas economy and rendering the tax useless as a revenueraiser, at least for the time being. Its repeal is a goal dear toBentsen, who is running for re-election this year.   Also approved was a plan to ban U.S. government purchases ofToshiba goods for three years. It also would bar import of productsof the company's Toshiba Machine Corp. subsidiary for three years.In the future, such violations would be punishable by import bansof two to five years.   The measure was designed to retaliate for Toshiba Machine's partin selling sophisticated computerized milling equipment to theSoviet Union to produce submarine propellers that are harder forU.S. listening equipment to detect. Export of the equipment tocommunist countries is barred under an agreement between Japan andWestern nations.   Farm-state negotiators, meanwhile, agreed on increasing theExport Enhancement Program by $1 billion. The program furnishesgrain companies and others with surplus government crops to inducethem to ship American grain overseas.</TEXT></DOC>
