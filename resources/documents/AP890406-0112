(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The fired captain of the Exxon Valdezwalked out of jail today after a judge reduced his bail from $1million to $25,000, calling the higher amount ``unconstitutionallyexcessive.''   Capt. Joseph Hazelwood posted bail, walked out of the SuffolkCounty jail at 12:59 p.m. and got into a waiting car with attorneyThomas Russo and another lawyer. He did not speak and showed noemotion as he walked off.   On Wednesday, another judge set bail for Hazelwood at $1 millionbond or $500,000 cash, comparing the effect of the oil tanker wreckin Alaska to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.   Justice Thomas Stark, the supervising judge of Suffolk CountyCriminal Court, today reduced the bail to $25,000 bond or cash.   ``The amount of bail is not commensurate with the seriousness ofthe crime or the effect of the crime on the community,'' Stark saidof the figure that had shocked even prosecutors.   ``We can't take out our wrath on one individual,'' said DistrictAttorney Patrick Henry, whose office originally had requested$25,000 bail.   Hazelwood, who faces three misdemeanor charges in Alaska, isaccused of being drunk when he relinquished command of the ExxonValdez to an uncertified seaman. The vessel then hit a reef March24, gushing 10.1 million gallons of crude oil into Prince WilliamSound and creating North America's worst oil spill.   Judge Kenneth Rohl, a naturalist who comes from a family ofprofessional seamen, set Hazelwood's bail Wednesday at $1 millionbond or $500,000 cash.   ``These misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never beenequaled, at least in this country,'' Rohl said. ``He's got to thinkabout that. We have a man-made destruction that has not beenequaled, probably, since Hiroshima.''   The U.S. bombing of Hiroshima at the end of World War II killedor injured nearly 130,000 people and leveled 90 percent of theJapanese city. No human life has been lost in the oil spill.   Dean Guaneli, Alaska's assistant attorney general, said the bailorder ``expresses the nation's outrage at what has happened.''   A pale, shaken Hazelwood, whose lawyer had sought $5,000 cashbail, was led from Rohl's courtroom in handcuffs after hisarraignment on the fugitive warrant.   ``It was tough for our client to hear,'' said defense attorneyMichael Chalos. ``It was very harsh, we thought.''   Hazelwood was taken to the Suffolk County Jail. He was granted30 days to prepare for an extradition hearing.   Authorities in Alaska have charged him with operating a shipwhile drunk, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil.He faces 2\ years in prison if convicted.   Hazelwood, 42, of Huntington, N.Y., was fired by Exxon last weekafter the National Transportation Safety Board said tests takenabout nine hours after the Good Friday disaster showed he was underthe influence of alcohol.   Rohl said that even though Hazelwood faces only misdemeanors,``We are not talking about someone breaking someone's windshield.We are talking about a global catastrophe.''   Russo said his client was no fugitive because ``he left Alaskabefore any charges had been filed against him.''   ``No one is saying this is not a tragedy,'' Russo said, butadded: ``Captain Hazelwood is not guilty of these crimes. He didnot commit any criminal acts in this affair.''   Hazelwood, who had shaven off his beard, appeared pale anddespondent after the judge's tongue-lashing. When officers puthandcuffs on him his hands were sweating and shaking.</TEXT></DOC>
