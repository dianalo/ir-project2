Only Norway severely criticized the Soviet government. It calledthe storming of two hospitals by Soviet troops to seize Red Armydeserters ``brutal and unwise.''   The Bush administration refrained from denunciations, saying itdid not want to ``inflame the situation.''   In Western Europe, the European Community appealed for ``maximumrestraint.''   Poland's Solidarity leader, Lech Walesa, expressed graveanxiety. In a letter to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, he accusedthe Soviet leader of a ``violating the sovereignty of Lithuania.''   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe, most of Moscow's allies made nocomment, although the news media reported fully the tensedevelopments in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital.   The restrained comment from Washington was a change from itsrepeated expressions of concern recently about the possible use offorce against Lithuania.   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater refused tocharacterize the seizure of army deserters as an escalation offorce.   ``I choose not to do it today,'' Fitzwater said. ``We simplydon't feel inflammatory language is helpful. We do not want toinflame the situation.''   The 12-nation European Community issued the call for restraintin a statement from its Brussels headquarters.   It added that it hoped ``for a respectful, open and fairdialogue between Moscow and Vilnius avoiding the use of force orthe threat of the use of force.''   Most members of the community have never recognized theincorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union in 1940.   But at the same time, many Western European governments havenoted that Gorbachev faces what French President FrancoisMitterrand recently called ``terrible problems,'' as Lithuania andother republics demand independence.   In the British House of Commons, Prime Minister MargaretThatcher sidestepped demands to condemn Gorbachev and to equate themilitary action in Lithuania with the invasions of Hungary andCzechoslovakia in 1956 and 1968.   ``Undoubtedly this is a very difficult situation, both forPresident Gorbachev and the people of Lithuania,'' said Mrs.Thatcher. ``It calls for great restraint on both sides. Force isnot an appropriate way to settle this petition ... it will not helpto be provocative in any way on either side.''   Political officers of the 16-nation NATO alliance, who met in aspecial session Monday and Tuesday in Brussels, hinted that thehospital attacks and Moscow's show of force in Lithuania over theweekend could damage improved East-West relations.   ``If the situation is not solved peacefully throughnegotiations, it could derail a lot of other things,'' said a NATOofficial, speaking in Brussels on condition of anonymity.   He said the officials felt that Gorbachev and the Lithuanianleaders should negotiate in ``an atmosphere free of intimidation''and that ``any adverse developments in Lithuania would haveconsequences for positive, international political trends.''   Similarly, Walesa told Gorbachev, ``Violating the sovereignty ofLithuania is an action directed against the process of constructinga new democratic order in Europe.''   After lauding Gorbachev's reform policies and the SovietCommunist Party's relinquishing of its monopoly on power, Walesasaid, ``I turn to you, Mr. President, to abandon the practice ofmilitary pressure and undertake political dialogue with theLithuanian government.''   Czechoslovakia said it supported the principle of ``autonomy inwhichever form a nation chooses.''   ``Naturally we are greatly interested that the prblem withLithuania will be resolved in a peaceful manner way,'' addedPresident Vaclav Havel's spokesman, Michael Zantovsky.   Norwegian Prime Minister Jan P. Syse called Moscow's parading oftanks and his order to confiscate Lithuanians' firearms ``ashockingly unwise step.''   ``Continued use of power will not solve any problems, but canseriously jeopardize the results recently achieved in East-Westrelations,'' Syse said in a statement.   The Netherlands, a member of the European Community, said itworried ``about the increasing pressure ... that is being exertedon the Lithuanian population through a military show of force.''   In Yugoslavia, an influential weekly, Danas, predicted thatother Soviet republics may break away from Moscow.   ``One can rightly wonder if the time for the fall of the great(Soviet) empire of peoples, which is shaking strongly, has notarrived,'' added Danas.</TEXT></DOC>
