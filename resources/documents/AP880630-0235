Based on conversations with freed French hostages in May,British diplomats ``were able to draw encouragement'' thattelevision journalist John McCarthy, 31, and lecturer Brian Keenanare alive, said the spokesman.   ``But so far as Terry Waite is concerned, we've got no hardevidence about his well-being or whereabouts,'' he said oncondition of anonymity, in keeping with British practice.   The spokesman said the British diplomats gained no evidenceregarding the nine Americans believed held captive by Shiite Moslemextremists in Lebanon.   Waite vanished on Jan. 20, 1987 in Beirut while trying to winthe release of Western hostages.   McCarthy was kidnapped April 17, 1986.   Keenan, of Belfast, Northern Ireland, has been missing sinceApril 11, 1986. He holds dual Irish and British nationality and hisrelease is also sought by the Irish government.   In all, 18 foreign hostages are still in captivity in Lebanon,most of them believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite extremists. Thelongest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent ofThe Associated Press, who was abducted on March 16, 1985.   Earlier Thursday, Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe told theHouse of Commons the government had received evidence the Britishhostages were alive. He did not say what the evidence was.   Reports earlier had said former French hostages Jean-PaulKauffmann and Marcel Fontaine, freed with fellow Frenchman MarcelCarton on May 4, had provided Britain with such evidence.   Howe reiterated Thursday that Britain would not compromise itspolicy of refusing to negotiate with kidnappers.   Four members of Parliament recently traveled to Tehran and heldunofficial talks with Iranian leaders about improving relationsbetween the two countries. One of them, Conservative legislatorTony Hicks, urged Howe to respond to Iranian overtures aimed atimproving relations with Britain.   Howe said Thursday, ``The Iranians must come to accept thatthere are certain necessary standards of international behaviorwhich must be observed if they are to have a normal relationshipwith the rest of the world.''</TEXT></DOC>
