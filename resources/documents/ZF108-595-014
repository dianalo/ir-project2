(MTI).andP;  The low number of responses for EMC, DistributedLogic and other drive manufacturers rendered results for their drivesstatistically insignificant, according to Greg Strakosch, ReliabilityRatings' founder.andM;The results for all four drives indicate that the DEC market is well-served,according to Jim Porter, president of the Mountain View, Calif., marketresearch company Disk Trend.andM;&quot;With numbers like those, I don't know why anyone would complain,&quot; Portersaid.andM;The report said the MTI MDI-276 drive, based on a 5-1/4-inch disk drive fromHitachi, turned in the best results.andP;  The MDI-276 boasts a mean time betweenfailure (MTBF) rating of 101,235 hours and an average availability of 99.99percent, according to the report.andP;  Seven percent of the MDI-276 drives in thesurvey failed, the report found.andM;DEC's RA90 placed second with an MTBF of 97,082 hours and an averageavailability of 99.99 percent, according to the report.andP;  Seven percent of theRA90s in the survey failed, the report said.andM;System Industries' SI92C, based on an 8-inch drive from Seagate, turned in anMTBF of 55,731 hours and an average availability of 99.96 percent, accordingto the report.andP;  Fifteen percent of the SI92C drives in the survey failed,according to the report.andM;The Emulex SD891, also based on an 8-inch drive from Seagate, has an MTBF of46,505 hours and an average availability of 99.90 percent, the report said.andO;Nineteen percent of the SD891 drives in the survey failed, according to thereport.andM;The time span between the user's call to the maintenance organization and therepair or replacement of the failed drive, also detailed in the ReliabilityRatings report, is factored into the MTBF rating, Strakosch noted.andM;For example, the size of DEC's field-service organization results inrelatively quick responses to customer calls.andP;  This helps boost the MTBFnumbers for the RA90, he said.andM;Information for Reliability Ratings' report was gathered from the company'ssubscribers and from a random survey conducted by the Framingham, Mass.,andO;market research company International Data Corp., according to Strakosch.andM;Reliability Ratings determines the MTBF for a drive by multiplying the numberof drives surveyed by the amount of time the drives are installed.andP;  Totaldowntime is subtracted from the result.andP;  Relevant downtime, such aspreventative maintenance and power failures, is then added to that result.andO;This figure is then divided by the total number of failures to arrive at theMTBF.andM;Reliability Ratings is also tracking CPU reliability.andP;  The completeReliability Ratings report will be available to subscribers.andM;Subscriptions to the company's service are priced at $199 per year.andM;Reliability Ratings Inc. can be contacted at 888 Worcester St., Wellesley, MA02181, (800) 477-7359.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
