Senate aides familiar with the case identified the Japanese supplier as Toshiba Corp. and the Norwegian intermediary as Kongsberg, a state-owned arms-manufacturer. The aides suspect that the 1985 shipments, if they were made, violated export-control rules adopted by the U.S. and 14 of its allies, including Japan and Norway.    A U.S. lawyer following the Pentagon investigation said the shipments would give the Soviets the ability to produce submarine propeller blades whose movement through the water can't easily be detected using existing U.S. anti-submarine technology.    Pentagon officials wouldn't confirm whether such propellers have been installed in Soviet submarines, but they acknowledged that Soviet acquisition of them could have serious strategic implications. The U.S. Navy is working to develop new devices to cope with the threat of an increasingly silent Soviet undersea fleet.    A Pentagon spokesman said the U.S. is pursuing the investigation with the help of the Japanese and Norwegian governments. If violations are uncovered, the two firms could be subject to penalties imposed by national laws as well as by the rules of the allied regulatory body known as the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, the spokesman said.    Some senators have conveyed their concern about the suspected violations to the Reagan administration, a Senate Banking Committee aide said. If confirmed, these violations could &quot;damage&quot; the committee's efforts to approve new legislation to ease existing export-control regulations, he said. The panel is scheduled to mark up amendments to the Export Administration Act next week.    Per Aasen, a spokesman for the Norwegian Embassy, confirmed that Norway is cooperating with the U.S. in investigating Kongsberg's possible role in the alleged shipments. &quot;We view this as very serious,&quot; he said. He said the Norwegian government will announce its findings &quot;sometime in May.&quot;    A Japanese Embassy spokesman said &quot;the matter is under investigation.&quot; The spokesman added that it has always been Japan's policy to &quot;observe&quot; the allied export-control agreement. </TEXT></DOC>
