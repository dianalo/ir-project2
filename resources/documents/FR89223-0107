Shannon, Counsel tothe Clerk, Merit Systems Protection Board, (202) 653-7200.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Merit Systems Protection Boardhas before it a number of cases which raise related issues concerning theproper interpretation and application of 5 U.S.C. 4302(b)(6), 5 U.S.C.4303(c)(2)(A), and 5 CFR 432.203(b). The Office of Personnel Managementhas intervened in one case and expressed its preliminary views concerningthe interpretation of applicable legal standards. The Board is seekingadditional briefs from interested parties addressing the issues noted below.As used in the following questions, the term ``performance improvementperiod'' (``PIP'') refers to the opportunity required by 5 U.S.C. 4302(b)(6)and 5 CFR 432.203(b) (1988). Additionally, unless otherwise stated, anyinstance of unacceptable performance referenced in these questions is assumedto have occurred within the 1-year period specified in 5 U.S.C. 4303(c)(2)(A).1. Under 5 U.S.C. 4303(c)(2)(A) an agency may base its decision on instancesof unacceptable performance which occurred during the 1-year period precedingthe advance notice and which were stated in the notice. Is this provisionmeaningless unless agencies are permitted to rely on unacceptable performancewhich occurs before or after the PIP but within the 1-year period?2. If an employee's performance is acceptable or better during the PIP,but then subsequently becomes unacceptable, may the agency take actionbased on the subsequent performance without informing the employee of theunacceptable performance by providing another PIP? If not, how long a timeperiod must elapse after the initial PIP before a new PIP is required?3. If agencies are not permitted to rely on pre- or post-PIP performance,apportioning a numerical standard during the PIP may not be feasible ormay require agencies to lower the performance standards in some cases.For example, if an employee commits one error under a standard which allowsonly one error per year, construing the standard to allow the employeeto commit an additional error during the PIP would be the equivalent ofpermitting two errors per year. However, if the employee is allowed noerrors during the PIP, it could be argued that the agency utilized an absoluteperformance standard during the PIP, which deprived the employee of a bonafide opportunity to improve. In such cases, how can the agency's rightto set performance standards be reconciled with the employee's right toan opportunity to improve?4. If agencies are permitted to consider unacceptable performance thatoccurs before or after the PIP where the employee's performance duringthe PIP is acceptable or better, what guidelines should be used in wieghtingthe performance during the various time periods? In addressing this issue,the following questions should be considered.a. Where a numerical performance standard requires a minimum productionor specifies the maximum errors on a yearly basis, can the numerical standardbe apportioned over the rating period? For example, if the employee's standardallows a maximum of twelve mistakes per year, should an employee's performancebe considered unacceptable if the employee makes two mistakes during thefirst month of the rating period?b. At the time an agency places an employee on a PIP, the employee mayalready have exceeded the number of errors allowed under the applicableperformance standard. What criteria should be applied to determine whetheror not an employee has demonstrated acceptable performance during the PIPin such cases? If the employee committed no additional errors during thePIP in this example, would a rule which permitted the agency to rely onthe employee's pre-PIP errors make the employee's right to an opportunityto improve meaningless?c. Should there be different guidelines for weighing pre- or post-PIP unacceptableperformance against PIP performance which is acceptable or better withrespect to standards which do not allow for numerical measurement?The Board may determine it would be beneficial to hold oral argument concerningthese issues. Any party interested in participating in such argument shouldindicate such interest in any filing made in response to this notice.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: February 17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
