Based on the results of the analyses itis supposed that metabolic peculiarities of denervated muscle createmore favourable conditions for stimulation of postradiation reparationin tissues of a nonirradiated muscle and, therfore, for restoration ofintercellular interactions in it and its regenerating ability.</TEXT></DOC>
