The House by voice vote approved an amendment adding $175million to its budget's veterans health care allocation, which wasalready above President Bush's recommendation.   Both chambers planned votes on several amendments through theday. But they expected to finish action tonight withoutdramatically altering the fiscal 1990 spending blueprint.   The budgets reflect a pact reached last month between Bush andcongressional leaders, which promises to shrink next year's deficitto just above $99 billion, in part by collecting an additional $5.3billion in taxes.   A partisan showdown looms over the composition of those taxes.   Bush claims $4.8 billion of that can be raised by actuallycutting a tax. He says slashing capital gains taxes would cause theeconomy to grow, with tax revenues growing proportionately.   Democrats _ including House Ways and Means Committee ChairmanDan Rostenkowski of Illinois _ have called the idea a money-loserthat would do little more than help the rich. They want to raisethe funds in unspecified other ways.   Speaking on the House floor, Rostenkowski said that Democrats onhis panel would not seek any new revenues unless Republicans wentalong. With Bush's ``no new taxes'' campaign pledge, Democrats areleery of being depicted as the party that favors higher taxes.   ``I will not encourage or support a revenue increase that doesnot have the support of the president and a majority of members ofboth sides of the aisle on my committee,'' he said.   Rostenkowski told a reporter he expected Bush to cajoleRepublican lawmakers, if necessary, to support any tax deal reachedbetween the administration and congressional Democrats.   ``It's the president's budget,'' Rostenkowski said. ``Thepresident is going to have to do it.''   Rostenkowski's Senate counterpart, Senate Finance CommitteeChairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, told his colleagues that his panelmay propose tax increases surpassing $5.3 billion because it mightalso approve some costly tax breaks.   Those tax breaks, which cost the government revenues, mightinclude the research-and-development tax credit and a cut in thesurtax for catastrophic health care insurance, Bensten said. He didnot say which tax increases he favors.   On Wednesday, the Senate picked its way through a series ofamendments, approving one adding $94 million for AIDS research andanother shifting $100 million to law enforcement from otherdomestic agency budgets. It also went on record against gas taxincreases, approving by voice vote a non-binding provision that thecurrent 9-cent-per-gallon levy be left alone.   In a 64-31 vote that illustrated the support they have for theirspending plan, the chamber's leaders also defeated an effort bySen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., to transfer $3 billion from defense toeducation programs.   ``We made an agreement, and I believe it is a responsible andfair agreement,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,D-Maine.   In the House, legislators spent their day arguing the merits oftheir $1.17 trillion plan, with many members arguing that it wasthe best that could be achieved considering Bush's reluctance toraise taxes and Democrats' aversion to domestic spending cuts.   ``We're left with having to work around the edges, which wedid,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.   In an effort to reduce this year's expected $163 billionshortfall, both chambers are relying heavily on rosy economicprojections, bookkeeping gimmicks such as shifting spending out offiscal 1990, and one-shot steps like selling federal assets.   They would allow $299.2 billion in defense spending next year,$2.5 billion more than this year. Expenditures for foreign aidwould reach $17 billion, and $14.2 billion would be raised fromtaxes, higher user fees, and asset sales.   Expected growth in programs that provide automatic benefits torecipients, such as federal pensions, would be cut by $8.3 billion.Among those savings would be $2.3 billion from Medicare, althoughlawmakers say they expect the cuts to come from payments to doctorsand hospitals, not from beneficiaries.   The greatest difference between the Senate and House is in howthey distribute money among most domestic programs. The Housefavored education, health and veterans programs, while the Senateplaced more emphasis on agriculture, energy and law enforcement.</TEXT></DOC>
