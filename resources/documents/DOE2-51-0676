The linear accelerator comprisesproton injector, hydrogen negative ion injector and hydrogen polarizedion injector, as well as the 100 MeV linear accelerator with drift tubesand (100-600) MeV linear accelerator, using accelerating structure withwashers and diaphragms. The accelerator length is 450 m. Nowadays theproton injector is mounted and 80 mA proton pulse current is obtained.At the benches of RF channel of the initial part of the accelerator thenominal pulse RF power of 4 MW is obtained. The mode of power input intoa four-sectional resonator is studied. Tests of the injector beam shapingresonators are conducted. The major part (80 %) of special technologicalequipment is produced and mounted. It is shown that geometrical and radiotechnicalparameters of the accelerator main units correspond completely to therequirements of beam dynamics. 20 refs.; 11 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
