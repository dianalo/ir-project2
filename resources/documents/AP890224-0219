Egyptian and American officials said the $1.3 million project isminiscule by the standards of the U.S. Agency for InternationalDevelopment in Egypt, where it administers economic aid of more than$865 million. Only Israel gets more.   But the three-year project to rebuild the historic mosques alsounlocks the door to further use of American development money forEgypt's famous monuments.   Often overshadowed by more famous pharaonic monuments, Cairo'sIslamic heritage is second to none. But squeezed by anever-expanding city and gutted from below by a rising water table,many of the 520 remaining Moslem monuments are in danger ofcrumbling.   Marshall D. Brown, the USAID director in Cairo, did not rule outfuture allocations for antiquities.   The project's chief architect, Saleh Lamei Mostafa, said in orderto do the job to his expectations, he needs much more money. ``Icall these reconstructions rather than restorations, because so muchwork has to be done,'' he said. ``I could use three times as muchmoney, but I'll do the best I can.''   Mostafa said the most challenging of the four mosques, al-ZahirBaybars al-Bunduqdari, is so decrepit that it accommodates fewerthan three dozen worshippers for Friday prayers. When he finishes,he said, 10,000 to 12,000 will pray there.   ``All the worshippers will be thanking the Americans for this,''he said.   The project's budget of 3 million Egyptian pounds comes from a``host-country fund'' generated by sale of spare parts, machineryand raw materials brought from the United States under the aidprogram for resale in local currency. Brown said both Egyptian andU.S. officials must approve outlays from the fund, which usuallytotals about 700 million pounds ($304 million).   In an interview, he said the fund generally finances developmentprojects. ``I think it seemed to us something that would seemsymbolically to tell the Egyptian people, `Hey, the Americans arepretty sensitive to your historical and cultural past' and show(our) support for it,'' he said.   Brown said the project originated in 1987 when U.S. AmbassadorFrank G. Wisner and Ahmed Kadry, then chairman of the EgyptianAntiquities Organization, agreed that something should be done torestore the medieval historical part of Cairo.   Fahmy Abd-Alina, antiquities director for Islamic and Copticmonuments, said the Americans were given the names of the four mosthistoric and important monuments that could benefit from financialaid.   ``This is ... a great, large and difficult project that wouldhave taken up too much of our own money if we had financed it. ...We're very grateful to the Americans,'' he said.   Two of the mosques _ the early 16th-century Ghuriya and15th-century al-Muayyad _ face a narrow, bustling thoroughfareleading from bazaar to bazaar in one of Cairo's last medieval areas.Once a marketplace for exotica-laden camel caravans, the picturesquearea provides the setting for the best-known works of NaguibMahfouz, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature last year.   The atmosphere beckons tourists seeking 1001 Arabian nights:covered alleys; donkey carts stacked with vegetables; streetpeddlers balancing on their heads loaves of fresh-baked bread andstalls where craftsmen stitch splotches of cloth into squares likethose once used to assemble the great Arabian tents.   Another mosque, built by the Mameluke Amir Shaykhu in 1349, liesin a separate part of Old Cairo within sight of the Citadel ofCrusader-fighter Saladin.   The first reconstruction will be in the spring at Baybars mosque,in a business and residential area about a 15-minute car ride fromdowntown Cairo. Pumps have been working for months to lower itswater table before the reconstruction engineers can go to work.   Dating from 1269, Baybars has a checkered history. It has houseda bakery, soap factory, abbatoir and stables. Napoleon's troops usedit as a fort, and later Ottoman Turks fired cannon from its rampartsagainst rebellious locals.   Today, few in Cairo even recognize Baybars as a mosque. Taxidrivers call it ``the English slaughterhouse,'' because that's whatBritish overlords used it for until early this century.   Mostafa specializes in Islamic architecture and formerly taughtat Beirut University. In preparation for the project, he has beenstudying plans left by workers who built Cairo's Islamic monuments,including 10th-century manuscripts left by Persian artisans, anddrawings by traveling artists in the 1800s when much of the old wasstill alive.   A major architectural challenge in Baybars will be to fashion apine-wood dome covered with lead sheets to replace the missingoriginal, which towered 60 feet from the floor.   He hopes to gather enough strong wood from demolished houses torebuild the dome. Wood for the original came from Jaffa in what isnow Israel, which Baybars seized from the Crusaders in 1268.   Baybars, one of the strongest Mameluke rulers, is said to havedesigned the enormous mosque himself to use as a rest house whileplaying polo on the grounds. He looted stone columns from monumentsthroughout Egypt for decoration.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv</NOTE></DOC>
