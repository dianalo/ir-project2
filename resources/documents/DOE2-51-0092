Applying the parallel channel effectsto the fuel bundle, water drain tubes with a restricted bottom end havebeen developed in order to mitigate counter-current flow limiting andto increase the falling water flow rate at the upper tie plate. The uppertie plate with water drain tubes is an especially effective means ofincreasing the safety margin of a reactor with narrow gaps between fuelrods and high steam velocity at the upper tie plate. The characteristicsof the water drain tubes have been experimentally investigated usinga small-scaled steam-water system simulating a BWR core. Then, theireffect on the fuel cladding temperature was evaluated using the LOCAanalysis program SAFER.</TEXT></DOC>
