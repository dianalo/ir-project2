VERNACI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republicans are looking for nice things tosay about Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, even if many of them hadn'theard of him before he became George Bush's vice presidentialrunning mate.   ``All I know is he is 41, from Indiana and seems attractive,''Edgar Heiskell, chairman of the West Virginia Republican Party,said after Bush announced his decision Tuesday. ``He looks like oneof George Bush's sons.''   Not everybody knew as much as Heiskell.   Massachusetts Republican Chairman Ray Shamie, who praisedQuayle, confessed that he thought the designated vice presidentialnominee hailed from Ohio.   ``I don't know anyone in our group who knows Sen. Quayle orknows how he helps,'' said California state Sen. Ken Maddy. ``I'mtrying to turn myself around and feel good about it, but I can't.''   One of Maddy's California Senate colleagues, Ed Davis, said ``sowhat'' to Quayle's selection.   ``The decision of the voters will be based strictly on thepresidential candidates, not the vice president or the platform oranything else,'' Davis said. ``I don't know him. I've never seenthe man. At least we can say he has no negatives at this point.''   Quayle is considered by his congressional colleagues to be aconservative with an aggressive debating style who could appeal toyounger voters.   His selection drew praise from others who had been consideredfor the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket.   Former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole said she was notdisappointed at being passed over and called Quayle a ``finechoice.''   Her husband, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who hadbeen another vice presidential possibility, made himself scarceafter the announcement and issued no statement.   But Dole, the 1976 vice presidential nominee known for hisoccasionally sharp tongue, was gracious when later cornered byreporters at the convention.   ``My reaction is they picked an outstanding young man,'' Doletold a Kansas television station. ``I'm very happy with the choice.He's a young man, a new generation.''   ``I was kind of stunned,'' said Sen. William Cohen of Maine, whohad been backing Sen. Dole for the vice presidential post.   ``He doesn't have the stature of a Dole ... or the following ofJack Kemp,'' Cohen said, adding that Bush may have been looking``to do something bold and different and surprise all the punditsand the experts.''   Kemp, a New York congressman also passed over for the job,called the Bush-Quayle pairing ``a very strong ticket for theRepublican Party.''   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said Quayle's obscurity can be overcome.   ``Nationally nobody knew who Lloyd Bentsen was until he gottapped for the Democratic ticket, so what difference does thatmake?'' Branstad asked.   Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis' campaign was restrained inits reaction.   ``This does not affect our campaign strategy in any way,'' saidcampaign spokesman Mark Gearan.   Bentsen, a senator from Texas, called the selection ``goodnews'' and said ``I'm looking forward to comparing our lists ofaccomplishments in the U.S. Senate and what each of us could do forhis running mate if we were elected.''   Sen. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, a liberal Republican,praised Quayle as a friend but stayed away from his stand on theissues.   ``First and most importantly, I regularly beat Dan Quayle attennis,'' Weicker said.   ``He's a solid conservative and by that I underline solid aboutthree times,'' said Weicker. ``So we disagree on the issues, butI'm very happy for him.''   While many Republicans were surprised or muted at Quayle'sselection, Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who has said for weeksthat he would oppose the selection of anyone who was notsufficiently conservative, was lavish in his praise.   ``I'm thrilled,'' Humphrey said. ``I couldn't be more pleased.I'm excited. I'm enthused.''   Television evangelist Pat Robertson, who formally ended his ownpresidential campaign Tuesday by releasing his delegates, calledQuayle ``a tremendous choice.''   ``On areas like abortion and school prayer ... he is right downthe line with the evangelicals,'' Robertson said.   In addition to helping gain support from younger voters, onedelegate said Quayle could boost the GOP's showing among women   ``If we're behind in the lady vote, my God, if he can't help usthere nobody can,'' said Louisiana state Sen. Ken Hollis.``Somebody asked me yesterday about him. I said, `He's a goodlooking Robert Redford.'''   Alabama delegate Jack Dunlop was less than pleased with thechoice. The 72-year-old Auburn real estate man, said Quayle is``too young and too inexperienced.''   Conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly said she was pleased withQuayle's selection.   ``I was supporting Jack Kemp, but he sort of looks like JackKemp,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
