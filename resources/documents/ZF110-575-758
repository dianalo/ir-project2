Can it keep up the pressure on Lotus, Ashton-tate, andMicrosoft as these well-entrenched and far-larger competitors react to itsinroads and correct their own missteps? Can it stay the course in multipleproduct areas as personal software gets more complex and development andsupport costs increase? Can it keep the entrepreneurial fire in the bellyeven as the good times roll?andM;Here to stayandM;All good questions.andP;  We certainly wouldn't predict that Borland will continueto grow indefinitely at its recent rate or that it will crush the leaders inthe market segments it is attacking.andP;  In fact, its best windows ofopportunity may be, closing as new versions of 1-2-3 and dbase IV hit themarket.andP;  We don't think Microsoft will neglect the object-orientedprogramming opportunity much longer.andP;  But we're satisfied that Mr. Kahn andhis troops in their bucolic retreat in the Santa Cruz Mountains have built anorganization and a strategy to be reckoned with.andP;  Borland is not going away.andM;Never too lateandM;Borland's success, we could add, ought to be encouraging news forentrepreneurs who may have thought that the personal software opportunity wasa closed book.andP;  Borland was able to enter large product segments late intheir development and carve out significant market share.andP;  It did this partlyand understandably with low prices, but that tactic never would have workedwithout great products and savvy marketing.andM;First, Borland is a technology company.andP;  The ability to use that technologyto exploit significant competitive opportunities is what really accounts forits recent good fortune.andP;  If nothing else, Borland has demonstrated that thisis still a technology-driven business, and that to our mind is a good thing.andM;Parlez-vous Pascal?andM;It's not news, of course, that Borland knows technology, and especially thetechnology of programming.andP;  Mr. Kahn founded the company in 1983 with aPascal compiler he and some French colleagues had devised, and strength inlanguages and other tools has provided both a stable revenue stream andsource of product innovation ever since.andM;What may be news, or at least what has allowed Borland to leverage itstechnology so effectively, is the evolution of a mature organization in whichdue attention is paid to sales, marketing, technical support, and otherbusiness basics.andP;  In his early days as a chief executive, Mr. Kahn could bejustly faulted for trying to do too much.andP;  He had, as one close observer ofthe company remarked with tongue not entirely in cheek, 300 direct reports.andO;Products and issues tended to be addressed serially, with short shrift givento those not on Mr. Kahn's front burner.andP;  That's no longer true.andM;New bloodandM;Things began to change in 1987, when Borland acquired Ansa Software and got,along with the Paradox database management product, its first outside salesforce and the management to run it.andP;  The Ansa deal also brought venturecapitalists Ben Rosen and Steve Dow to the Borland board, a step which wethink has contributed to the company-building process.andM;Since then, Borland has continued to bring in seasoned software managers,including Rob Dickerson from Microsoft, Steve Kahn (no relation) from LotusDevelopment, Spencer Leyton from Symantec, and Eugene Wang from Gold HillComputers.andP;  Earlier this year Mr. Kahn formalized the power sharing that wasgoing on by setting up independent business units for database products(headed by Mr. Dickerson), spreadsheets (Mr.andP;  Kahn), and languages (Mr.andO;Wang).andP;  Mr. Leyton, who is formally director of business development, handlessales, marketing, and legal affairs and apparently acts as a de facto chiefoperating officer.andM;Counter cultureandM;That leaves Mr. Kahn (Philippe, we mean) free to concentrate on the technicalmatters that are his first love and to watch over a corporate culture that helikes to describe as &quot;barbarian.&quot; That is, Borland is supposed to bepopulated by nonbureaucratic people who never write memos or clean off theirdesks, who operate in small groups, and who take long walks in the woods whenthey have something serious to discuss.andP;  They certainly don't stand onceremony.andP;  Mr. Kahn may be the only chief executive of a $200 million companywho greets visitors in athletic shorts and tennis shoes.andM;It won't be easy to maintain this casual-yet-driven atmosphere as the companygrows.andP;  But it's essential to Borland's strategy that it remain attractive tohot-shot programmers and that it stay lean enough to move their products tomarket as fast as any startup.andP;  How lean is lean? With only 765 people on thepayroll, Borland is currently running at an annual sales per employee rate ofalmost $300,000.andM;Borland goes to unusual lengths to save money.andP;  Advertising is still limitedto trade publications; slick business magazines need not inquire.andP;  AndBorland doesn't use an outside ad agency.andP;  All the ads are designed andplaced internally.andP;  One area Borland can't shortchange any longer, though, iscustomer support, which across the industry is moving from a backroomoperation to a major marketing tool.andP;  Borland is expanding its hours fortelephone assistance, although not yet to the 24-hour service offered byLotus and others, and the technical support organization is being tripled.andM;Something for everybodyandM;Although the business unit structure will help Borland do a better job offocusing on its most important product lines, it is still a relatively smallcompany spread across several important product areas.andP;  In addition to thespreadsheet, relational database, and language businesses - which might beenough for most companies - Borland remains committed to its Sidekickpersonal information manager, the Reflex flat-file database, and a wordprocessor called Sprint.andP;  Two of the smaller language products, however, havebeen disposed of.andM;Despite its gains, Borland isn't likely to match the market clout of its bigcompetitors anytime soon.andP;  For one thing, Mr. Kahn remains firmly opposed toforays onto hardware platforms beyond the Intel architecture personalcomputer.andP;  Having the best product on one platform, he argues, is betterstrategy than having average products on many platforms.andP;  Borland'spenetration of its competitors' customer base is bound to slow down.andP;  It canonly win by accelerating the development of product improvements thatgenerate increased revenues from its own customers and keep it attractive asan alternative to the giants.andM;In the past, this has meant developing or acquiring core technologies thatcan be spread quickly to all product areas.andP;  Mr. Kahn intends to ensure thatthis process continues: Despite the restructuring, all the researchoperations continue to report directly to him.andM;If at firstandM;The most obvious connection between innovation and market success has been inspreadsheets, where Borland had previously found no more success than theother 50 or so challengers that have bounced off Lotus' armor.andP;  The firstversion of Quattro, introduced in 1987, offered some improvements over 1-2-3but not enough to overcome a fatal flaw.andP;  Its capacity was too limited toaccomodate the largest 1-2-3 files and thus couldn't make the grade as acorporate standard.andM;Borland redoubled its efforts for the follow-on product that arrived latelast year.andP;  One important development was the use of object-oriented memorymanagement technology - VROOMM, as Borland chooses to call it - to increasespreadsheet capacity while keeping memory requirements within the 640K limitof most Pcs.andM;Quattro Pro also got graphics and publishing capabilities beyond those inRelease 2.2 of 1-2-3 and spreadsheet consolidation features found only inRelease 3.0.andP;  To make the choice irresistible for Lotus customers unable tochoose between upgrade alternatives, Borland priced the product at $99.95 foranybody who could show they owned the original Quattro - or a copy of 1-2-3.andM;Raiding partyandM;The strategy worked beyond any reasonable hope or expectation.andP;  Of thehalf-million or more Quattro Pro buyers in the past year, more than 80%claimed to have been Lotus users.andP;  Of course, revenues from the product havebeen far lower than they might have been if all had been sold at the fullprice of $495.andP;  But the goal for any newcomer to a software market has to bebuilding a customer base as fast as possible.andP;  Borland has certainly donethat.andP;  And as the chart on this page shows, that growth hasn't come at theexpense of earnings.andM;Object lessonandM;On the database side, Paradox has been given a number of facelifts since theacquisition, including graphics and user interface features developed as coretechnology for all Borland products.andP;  In its latest version, introduced inSeptember, Paradox gets a dose of VROOMM to improve performance and allow theconstruction of larger applications.andP;  Other enhancements, including access toSQL data on various database servers, also are intended to appeal tocorporate software developers.andM;With its elegant Query-By-Example interface, Paradox gained favor amongpeople who actually use database management systems.andP;  But as a programmer'stool it has lacked the power and flexibility of dBase and the otherapplication development products like Fox Software's FoxPro and Nantucket'sClipper that are rooted in dBase.andM;Borland has now improved programmability with SQL Link and something calledthe Paradox Engine, which makes it easier to access and manipulate Paradoxdata with custom programs.andP;  And it has launched a campaign to cultivatedevelopers interested in SQL applications while the Server Edition of dbase(required for SQL compatibility) remains on the vapor list.andM;A new Lotus positionandM;But the days of easy pickings may be coming to an end for Borland.andP;  Inspreadsheets, Lotus has started shipping Release 3.1 of 1-2-3, which correctsthe publishing and graphics deficiencies of 3.0.andP;  Lotus is also becoming farmore aggressive on upgrade policies, offering a range of low prices andmaking it easier for customers to upgrade through retailers.andP;  It's alsotaking a much tougher line in advertising, we notice.andM;The database wars are also heating up as Ashton-tate heals its wounds undernew management and as shipments of the cleaned-up version of dBase IV startto climb.andP;  The Server Edition went to beta testing in September and shouldmake its debut shortly.andP;  Even without these events, Borland might haveproblems capturing enough experienced developers and resellers to seriouslydamage dBase's position as the leading database development tool.andM;Dueling precedentsandM;Then there is the copyright infringement suit filed against Borland and SantaCruz Operation shortly after Lotus won a favorable ruling in its case againstPaperback Software International.andP;  Borland's attorneys believe Quattro Prodiffers enough from 1-2-3 and from Paperback's VP Planner that the precedentwon't apply.andP;  They cite another recent case, won by Ashton-tate, in which thecourt held that a menu structure alone isn't copyrightable.andP;  But thatdecision came down in California and won't necessarily apply inMassachusetts, where the same judge who ruled against Paperback will preside.andM;Visual artsandM;The whole issue of look and feel will shift as Borland and Lotus climb aboardthe graphical interface juggernaut.andP;  Both are working furiously on Windows3.0 versions in which competition will probably center on visual appeal andfeatures such as publishing power and integration with other programs.andO;Borland is also working on a visual programming product intended to ease thecreation of spreadsheet and database applications on Windows 3.0.andM;But this, of course, is Microsoft turf.andP;  Up to now, Quattro Pro hasn'tcompeted directly with Excel, which has been 1-2-3's other major competitionand probably has a market share equivalent to Quattro's.andP;  In fact, it hasprobably been more helpful than not for both parties to have anotheralternative in the market.andP;  But peaceful coexistence will break down when allthree players are battling for graphical bragging rights.andM;Start your enginesandM;We still wouldn't discount Borland's chances, because the transition to a newplatform gives it another opportunity to push innovation faster than itsoften-ponderous competitors.andP;  And Borland's strength in object-orientedprogramming and other software development technology should pay off ascompetition hinges increasingly on the ability to get very complex productsto market quickly.andP;  Borland thinks it can halve the usual development time -and it may have to.andP;  Tabular Data Omitted.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
