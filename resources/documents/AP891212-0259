Pitney Bowes also said it plans to cut the number ofdistribution centers, eliminate some of its field operations andbegin a major training program, as part of an initiative to makethe company more competitive and efficient in the 1990s.

George B. Harvey, chairman and president, said the changes willrequire fewer jobs in manufacturing, as well as different skills inthose who make, sell and service the company's products.   The company said it would undertake major programs to trainemployees in new design, manufacturing and product servicetechniques.   Harvey said the initiatives, including a new division to sell,market and service dedicated copiers in the U.S., would ``bring useven closer to our customers, assuring us a significant competitiveadvantage and excellent return for our stockholders.''
