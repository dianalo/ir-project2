The rateof clearance (k) of the inhaled /sup 99/Tcsup(m)-DTPA from lung to bloodwas measured using a gamma scintillation camera with computer data acquisition.During a single clearance study the subjects voluntarily breathed closeto total lung capacity (TLC) and close to residual volume (RV). Tidalvolume, respiratory frequency and end expired volume were measured witha water spirometer. When they breathed close to TLC the rate of clearanceincreased compared with breathing close to RV. This effect of changingvolume was immediately reversible after adopting each new lung volume.There were no significant changes in tidal volume or respiratory frequencybetween each 5 min period. There was no significant difference betweenthe clearance increased compared with breathing close to RV. This effectof changing volume was immediately reversible after adopting immediateand reversible.</TEXT></DOC>
