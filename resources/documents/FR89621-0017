List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 303 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Introduction </ITAG>The Deputy Assistant Administrator for Criminal Enforcement is authorizedto exercise his discretion in paying up to $10,000 for information leadingto the arrest and successful prosecution of any person for a criminal violationof CERCLA, as amended. The environmental and public health dangers associated with the illegaldisposal of hazardous materials have emerged as a matter of national interestand concern. In order to provide an incentive for individuals to come forwardwith information concerning such illegal practices, Congress has authorizedEPA to establish a program to reward citizens for providing informationuseful in prosecuting those involved in illegal hazardous waste activity.Because many informants are only available and reliable when they are givenappropriate and efficacious assurances that their identity will be protectedfrom disclosure, the security of assured confidentiality is necessary toprotect their employment status or some other legitimate privacy interests.The award provision provides both the security of confidentiality and theincentive of a cash award for an informant to come forward with pertinentinformation on the criminal violations of CERCLA. Both the initial determination of a claimant's eligibility for an awardand the subsequent determination of any amount to be awarded to a claimantare matters vested by statute in the exclusive discretion of the Agency.These determinations entail subjective considerations relating to the soundadministration of justice and to cooperation with EPA investigators andDepartment of Justice prosecutors. Providing information to the Agencyby any private citizen does not create any obligation to pay compensationfor such voluntary assistance. Law enforcement officials are not deemedto be ``private citizens'' as contemplated by this award program. Law enforcementofficial means any employee of the Federal government who takes part in,or is responsible for, the enforcement of Federal statutes and regulationsgoverning the handling of hazardous substances or wastes. Inasmuch as these decisions are made pursuant to the Deputy Assistant Administrator'sdiscretionary grant authority under CERCLA section 109(d), they constitutefinal administrative action on any properly filed award claim. This awardauthority is properly deemed to constitute the making of a discretionarypublic grant. Because this rule relates to public grants, benefits, orcontracts, it is exempt from all requirements of Section 553 of the AdministrativeProcedures Act including notice and opportunity for comment and delayedeffective date. EPA believes the program will lead to increased enforcement activity withgreater deterrent impact. This program will also help the Agency attainits mandated goals of a cleaner environment and the earlier interventionof remedial resources, which will result in cost savings, enhanced publichealth protection and more expeditiously conducted cleanups. To expeditethis process, EPA issued an interim-final rule in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on May 5, 1988 (53 FR 16086), in which the Agencyrequested comments over a 120-day period that closed on September 2, 1988,and which became effective on the date of publication. Today's final ruleis identical to the interim-final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Response to Comments </ITAG>The Agency received only two comments. One commenter protested that thisrule constitutes imprudent governmental action and should be withdrawnbecause it encourages secret witnesses to make unfounded charges and, bygranting the protection of confidentiality, the rule denies the falselyaccused a cause of action for damages against its unknown detractor. This commenter's policy concerns are deemed unpersuasive and unfounded.In particular, the Agency's trained investigators are fully qualified todiscern early on, and reject, unsubstantiated allegations of wrongdoing,so that innocent persons or companies are not subjected to unwarrantedgovernment investigations or enforcement actions. Furthermore, in responseto the commenter's overall policy concerns, the Agency notes that thereare numerous other Federal agencies which provide awards on a similar basisin furtherance of specific statutory authority (<T3>e.g.: </T3>18 U.S.C. 3056(c)(1)(D) (information concerning laws enforcedby the Secret Service); 18 U.S.C. 1751(g) (information concerning Presidentialassassination); 14 U.S.C. 643 (information concerning interference withaids to navigation); 50 U.S.C. 47a (information concerning nuclear material);21 U.S.C. 886(a) (information concerning drugs and narcotics); 39 U.S.C.404(a)(8) (information concerning postal laws); 18 U.S.C. 3059(a)(1) (informationconcerning violation of U.S. criminal law); 26 U.S.C. 7623 (informationconcerning internal revenue laws); 22 U.S.C. 2708(a) (information concerningacts of terrorism outside the United States); 18 U.S.C. 3071 (informationconcerning acts of terrorism within the United States); 10 U.S.C. 7209(information concerning missing naval property); 16 U.S.C. 1540(d) (informationconcerning endangered species); 16 U.S.C. 3375(d) (information concerningfish and wildlife); and 16 U.S.C. 668(a) (information concerning the killingof bald eagles)). In deciding to establish such award programs in orderto encourage submission of information which facilitates discovery of violationsof Federal laws, Congress has determined that encouraging increased compliancewith those laws outweighs policy concerns such as those raised by the commentor(<T3>e.g., </T3>possibility of unfounded charges). The Agency has determined that, as a practical matter, the provision ofconfidentiality is essential in order to provide private citizens withthe incentive and reassurance needed to allow EPA to effectively carryout the award program. In line with expressed Congressional intent in CERCLAsection 109(d) to institute a program which authorizes awards in appropriatecircumstances to address criminal violations of the statute, the Agencywill promulgate this final rule. Another commenter raised the possibility of a disgruntled employee intentionallysabotaging equipment to cause a spill to go unreported or intentionallydestroying required records, for which acts a responsible corporate officialmay be charged due to information provided by the employee-saboteur. Thecommenter recommended amending andSection; 303.20(a) to include in the personsexcluded from eligibility consideration those who were ``involved'' or``charged'' in the case giving rise to an award claim to reduce the likelihoodof sabotage by removing an employee saboteur from possible eligibilityfor an award. The Agency agrees generally with the commenter's basic assertion that acriminal offender should not profit from his/her criminal conduct. Currently,andSection; 303.20(a) specifically excludes such persons from eligibilityfor an award. There may be situations, however, where it might be appropriate to grantan award to someone who is in some way connected with_but not actuallyconvicted for_the underlying violation for which information is submitted.Thus, a person's responsibility or fault may be so minor, unwitting orunintentional as to be greatly outweighed by the fact that the informationprovided by the person is crucial to a successful prosecution of a trulysignificant violation, so that a small award might be justified. The Agencyconsiders the scenario suggested by the commenter_a saboteur releasinga reportable quantity of hazardous substance, then providing informationto the Agency if the person in charge fails to give proper notification_tobe highly unlikely due to the potential for criminal liability for thesaboteur for his actions under other environmental statutes such as theClean Water Act and RCRA. In any event, the Agency believes that such situations, while extremelyrare, are most appropriately analyzed not in the context of eligibility,but rather in the context of andSection; 303.30(d), dealing with ``Criteriafor Payment of Award.'' For example, that section of the rule expresslyprovides that ``concealment of a person criminally culpable'' and ``existenceof an organized criminal conspiracy''_including involvement of the informant_areboth appropriate reasons for the Deputy Assistant Administrator in theexercise of his discretion to decide not to grant an award. As such, aperson's actions and possible culpability would be weighed with the otherfactors set forth in andSection; 303.30(d) of the rule in determining whetherto make an award, as well as in setting an amount should one be made. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Summary of Regulatory Analyses </ITAG>A. Executive Order No. 12291 Proposed regulations must be classified as major or non-major to satisfythe rulemaking protocol established by Executive Order No. 12291. Accordingto Executive Order No. 12291, major rules are those that are likely toresult in: (1) An annual cost to the economy of $100 million or more; or (2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.This final regulation provides an entirely voluntary procedure by whichindividuals who learn of potential criminal violations of the provisionsof the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and LiabilityAct (CERCLA), as amended, may disclose their information to EPA and applyfor an award of up to $10,000. Because this final rulemaking imposes nonew burdens of any nature upon any regulated entity and creates no additionalregulatory entities, and since the maximum award is limited to $10,000,no formal Regulatory Impact Analysis is necessary. This final rule wassubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review asrequired by Executive Order No. 12291. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires that a Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis be performed for all rules that are likely to have ``significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' Because thisrulemaking applies only to individuals who choose to volunteer informationto the Agency regarding the criminal violations of CERCLA, it should haveno effect upon any other organizations, entities, or businesses, eitherlarge or small. Therefore, EPA certifies that this proposed regulationwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1986 requires approval from the Office ofManagement and Budget (OMB) for information requests. Because the Act exemptsfrom OMB clearance federal criminal matters or actions, and because thisfinal rulemaking is related to federal criminal enforcement under CERCLA,the Paperwork Reduction Act requirements do not apply. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 303 </ITAG>Law enforcement, Intergovernmental relations, Superfund, Crime, Awards,National Response Center notification of release, Destruction of recordsrequired to be retained.<ITAG tagnum="6">William K.
