From this unpromising beginning, South Korea has becomeone of the wonders of the developing world. Its per-capitaincome has increased from less than $90 in 1953, when theKorean War ended, to nearly $5,000 today. National pride,devastated by the division of the peninsula and 35 years ofbrutal Japanese colonization, has rebounded. Most important,massive popular demonstrations in June 1987 against thedictatorship of Chun Doo Hwan forced his protege, Roh TaeWoo, to concede to demands for political liberalization. TheSeoul Olympics in 1988 were the high-water mark of nationalhubris. Here we are, South Korea could boast, with an electedgovernment, 12% economic growth, and we beat Japan in themedal count.</LP><TEXT>   But these days the talk in Seoul, a tidy high-rise city of10 million people, is not of achievements, but of nationalangst. In 1989, economic growth slipped to 6.7%, in partbecause of crippling strikes, and crime surged. This year,though growth has picked up, the stock market has beenunsteady, exports have slowed and inflation hit a nine-yearhigh in April.   Among the public, the fact that democratization has notmeant that things are better every day in every way has beendifficult to accept. The student left has picked up on this.&quot;Yes, I want the present government to fall,&quot; says a Mr. Lee,a forestry student in a Seoul university attending ananti-government demonstration. &quot;We can't wait for an electionbecause a fair election is not guaranteed.&quot;   Mr. Lee is untroubled by the contradiction of encouragingdemocracy by bringing down a freely elected government. Andhe is not alone in his somewhat skewed perspective of howdemocracy works. It is not unusual to hear middle-classKoreans say that what the country really needs is a strongleader to get things cracking, sort of like a dictator, butnicer.   It was in this context that Mr. Roh, elected president inDecember 1987, announced this January the merger of theDemocratic Justice Party with the second- and third-largestopposition parties, respectively led by Kim Young-Sam and KimJong-Pil, a Chun ally and founder of the Korean CentralIntelligence Agency. Their merger into the Democratic LiberalParty (DLP) was supposed to guarantee political stability.With 220 of the National Assembly's 299 seats, the idea wasthat the party could work its will.   It hasn't worked out that way; the ruling party did poorlyin two by-elections against the upstart Democratic Party,composed of assemblymen opposed to the merger, and the DLP'sapproval rating has sunk as low as 8.9% in opinion polls.This month's agreement to establish diplomatic relations withthe Soviet Union could be the first step toward turning thetide, but for now the DLP is about as popular as Chun DooHwan, who is in self-exile in a remote Buddhist monastery.&quot;Everything has ups and downs,&quot; says Lee Hong-Koo, thepresident's senior political adviser. &quot;In this case we hadthe downs first.&quot;   While five months is far too short a time to judge themerger experiment -- the appropriate tests are this year'slocal elections and the 1992 national elections -- the gap sofar between expectations and reality illustrates the promiseand the problems of Korea's nascent democracy.   &quot;We had to merge to create one party in order to pass thelaws and execute the policies&quot; the country needs, says DLPchairman Kim Young-Sam, who ran second to Mr. Roh in the 1987elections. Not everyone sees such altruism in the merger,noting the decision was made secretly and announced suddenly.Just three years ago, Mr. Kim accused Mr. Roh of stealing theelection; his willingness to join his former rival is widelyseen as a ploy to position himself for the presidency in1992.   Much of the popular unease is derived from that fact thathaving long lived under dictators, people are wary of whatlooks like an attempt to create a one-party system. Theproblem is that the four-party system that preceded themerger did not work. By winning only 125 of the 299 seats inthe 1988 elections, President Roh's party was easily blockedin the National Assembly. The DLP sees itself as a naturalway to break this logjam; the public does not yet trust it.   The natural response would be to create a strongopposition force. Along these lines, the Democratic Party hasproposed merging with the Party for Peace and Democracy,which has 70 seats in the National Assembly. The problem isthat the Democratic Party is demanding that Kim Dae-Jung stepdown from the leadership as the price of merger. Notsurprisingly, Mr. Kim is unwilling to commit politicalhara-kiri to accommodate the DP, which has only eightNational Assembly seats.   These maneuverings are being played out against abackground of popular uncertainty whether the country will beable to manage the simultaneous transition to a moresophisticated economy and a democratic political order. &quot;Thewelfare of the average citizen is deteriorating,&quot; says aDaewoo factory worker.   Some of that frustration finds an outlet inanti-Americanism; it's easier, and for students anyway, morefun, to blame the Yanks for everything from North Korea tofarm problems. &quot;The unification of the DLP is done by U.S.control,&quot; says a Korean student of German literature.&quot;Control of the military is also done by the U.S.&quot; This kindof thinking is a minority attitude, but nonethelessinfluential, if only because activists kick up a fuss withsuch methods as attempting to firebomb the U.S. culturalcenter in Kwangju at its reopening earlier this month. Atbottom, it is rooted in the idea that everything on thepeninsula is within America's power to change. Thatperception is flawed -- the trade hawks in Congress only wishit were true -- and as insulting to South Korea as it is tothe U.S.   South Korea is going through a period of economic andsocial uncertainty these days, but these are natural problemsgenerated by the startling progress it has made. The issue isnot only what policies Koreans should adopt, but whatprocess. Under dictatorial presidents Park Chung Hee and ChunDoo Hwan, who ruled consecutively from 1961 to 1987, Koreaenjoyed 8% growth and not nearly enough freedom. Of late,there has been less growth and more freedom. It can have both-- but it will require staying the democratic course, evenwhen, as now, the going gets rough.   ---   Ms. Murphy is deputy editorial page editor of The AsianWall Street Journal.</TEXT></DOC>
