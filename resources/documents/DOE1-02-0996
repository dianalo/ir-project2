The lines areassumed to be formed by dielectronic recombination and inner-shell excitation.The dielectronic rates were calculated using a suite of computer programsdeveloped by one of the authors. The inner-shell contribution was estimatedby van Regemorter's formula. The present calculations were applied tothe problem of radial ion diffusion in tokamaks. Spectra were calculatedby integrating along various lines-of-sight to simulate what might beobserved by an actual spectrometer viewing a tokamak plasma. A methodfor determining the diffusion coefficient from tokamak observations isdiscussed.</TEXT></DOC>
