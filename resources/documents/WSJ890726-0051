The Baton Rouge, La., company said it hopes that selling the assets will reduce the risk in its loan portfolio, cut its administrative costs and help its return to profitability.    Terms of the plan call for the new bank, to be called Florida Street National Bank, to buy the troubled assets for $315 million. To pay for the assets, Florida Street would issue about $250 million in bonds and would get a $50 million note from Premier.    In addition, Premier would capitalize the new bank with about $15 million, including about $13.5 million in preferred stock to be owned by Premier and about $1.5 million in common stock that would be paid as a special dividend to Premier's current shareholders.    To reflect the reduced value of the troubled assets, Premier said it took a special reserve of $78 million for its second quarter, which contributed to its net loss of $99.4 million. Premier said the transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed by year end. </TEXT></DOC>
