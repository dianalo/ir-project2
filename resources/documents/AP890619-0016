(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Miners at the Pittson Coal Group's only activemines in Kentucky walked out early Monday, joining a bitter strikeby an estimated 20,000 coal miners in six states.   On Sunday, about 4,000 people attended a solidarity rally inWaynesburg, Pa., near the West Virginia line. ``The labor union hasbeen asleep, but this sleeping giant has awakened,'' said EdYankovich, incoming president of United Mine Workers District 4.   Miners began walking off their jobs in southern West Virginia atthe beginning of last week in support of the strike againstPittston. By Monday, the walkout had spread to Pennsylvania,Indiana, Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee.   UMW President Richard Trumka on Sunday called a strike by about200 miners at three Eastern Coal Corp. mines in eastern Kentuckynear the West Virginia border, the only active Pittston holdings inthat state. The walkout began at 12:01 a.m. Monday.   ``Everyone feels it was long overdue,'' said Terry Varney, aspokesman for UMW Local 5737. ``We're glad to finally be joining theothers on the picket line. Morale is high and with solidarity wefeel we can beat Pittston.''   Boyd Vance, a miner on strike near the Guyandotte River insouthern West Virginia, expects the wildcat strikes to spreadfurther. Then, if coal production still isn't stopped, he'll startlooking out for trouble.   ``I believe in being able to express myself peacefully in anon-violent way, but there are others out there who, at the drop ofthe hat, will kill you for what they believe in,'' Vance said.   Two people have been killed in UMW strikes in recent years: anon-union truck driver caught in sniper fire in 1985 and a strikingminer shot by a guard in 1978.   The union has been on strike against Pittston in Virginia andWest Virginia since April 5 because it hasn't had a contract sinceFebruary 1988. Two judges in Virginia have jailed three strikeleaders and fined the union millions of dollars.   Though the union leadership denies orchestrating the walkouts atmines other than Pittston's, which violate the contract, Trumka lastweek urged miners to return to the fighting spirit they had in the1970s.   ``If I was working for the mine workers, I'd go after Trumka'sscalp,'' Pittston spokesman Bill Byrne said.   West Virginia once was the nation's largest coal producer, butwildcat strikes in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s areblamed for reducing production and sending coal customers elsewhere.Kentucky and Wyoming now lead the nation _ West Virginia is third.   ``All this puts West Virginia in a position of being anunreliable supplier,'' said Gary White, president of the WestVirginia Coal Association. ``We had that situation in the 1960s and1970s, with all the instability.   ``Our customers are wondering if this is the beginning of thattype of pattern.''   The expiration of contracts between the UMW and the BituminousCoal Operators Association prompted nationwide strikes in 1971, 1974and 1977.   But scores of smaller impromptu strikes took place for reasonsranging from lost time because of a flood _ 3,000 miners struck fora week _ to cuts in medical benefits _ 70,000 miners out for sixweeks.   The UMW leadership has denied ordering the current wildcat.   ``I'm not aware of any order from the union dictating that ourmembers walk off the job,'' UMW spokesman Joe Corcoran saidSaturday. ``The miners have walked off the job and in most caseshave articulated both anger and frustration at the heavy-handednessof the Virginia courts' imprisonment of strike leaders and fines.''   But in Birmingham, Ala., UMW District 20 international boardmember Tommy Buchanan said Friday that it was up to Trumka whetherAlabama miners walk out. ``It will start whenever it comes down fromthe union president,'' he said.   At the heart of the current walkout is the contract dispute withPittston. But Pittston last week declared negotiations at animpasse, which allowed it to implement its latest contract offer.Federal labor law requires UMW leaders to present that offer totheir members.   Miners' anger also is aimed at the two judges who have fined theunion $3 million for peaceful demonstrations and jailed three menfor continuing civil disobedience.   ``Everyone would have been working right now if that judge hadnot stepped in and put that kind of fine and penalty on the union,''said John Vance, a newly elected rank-and-file board member andAshland Coal miner.   Boyd Vance, who is no relation to John Vance, said the Pittstonsituation is make-or-break.   ``They're going against everything we've ever had. If we letPittston get away with it, then all these other companies will comeup and say, ``We know the route. Let's take it,''' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
