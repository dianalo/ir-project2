The fiscal year's decline was the first since the current account swung to a surplus in the year ended March 31, 1983, from two consecutive years of deficit.    The ministry's report was a further illustration of the changing shape of trade for Japan, whose wide surplus has been steadily narrowing. Ministry officials cited the strong yen, which has made Japanese exports more expensive in terms of other currencies, and steps by the government to make the economy more dependent on domestic sources -- and less dependent on external demand -- for its growth.    &quot;These statistics show that the government's effort to change the country's industrial structure and reduce our dependence on exports has been successful,&quot; an official said.    The ministry said that the current-account surplus narrowed to $8.12 billion in March from $8.49 billion a year earlier. After seasonal adjustment, the surplus stood at $7.28 billion, down from $7.86 billion in February. In the full fiscal year, the surplus fell to $84.54 billion from a record $94.14 billion a year earlier.    The current account measures trade in goods and services, as well as some unilateral transfers.    In its report, the ministry said the March merchandise-trade surplus narrowed to $9.24 billion from $9.39 billion a year earlier, as exports rose 17.9%, to $22.43 billion, and imports grew a faster 36.9%, to $13.19 billion. After seasonal adjustment, the March trade surplus was $8.40 billion, down from $8.45 billion in February. Adjusted exports slipped 0.5% from February, to $20.83 billion, while imports declined 0.4%, to $12.42 billion.    The trade surplus in the full fiscal year declined to $94.28 billion from $101.65 billion a year earlier. Exports grew 10.5%, to $233.39 billion, and imports 26.9%, to $139.11 billion. Both totals were records.    Japan reports two sets of merchandise-trade figures for each month. It first reports trade figures that are measured when goods pass through customs; in that report, imports include freight and insurance costs, but exports don't. When the current-account report is released, the ministry includes a second set of merchandise-trade figures that measure imports and exports when contracts are settled; in this case, neither imports nor exports include freight and insurance costs. </TEXT></DOC>
