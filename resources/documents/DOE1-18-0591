LMWF (Low Molecular Weight Fraction) in seawater was 1.05 {mu}gl{sup-1} in the surface layer and 0.64 {mu}gl{sup -1} on average in the 5to 40 m deep layer. On the otherhand, the HMWF (High Molecular WeightFraction) was nearly fixed within the range from 0.06 {mu}gl{sup -1}to 0.1 {mu}gl{sup -1}. The HMWF, percentage was 9% to 17% of total nucleicacid bases. As to base composition, uracil was found most in the LMWF,and only uracil and cytosin were found in the HMWF. IN the LMWF of porewater, only uracil and hypoxianthine were found, and in the HMWF, basesother than thimine were determined the quantity. The percentage of theHMWF attained to 73% of total nucleic acid bases, which is very highcompared with that in seawater. (2 figs, 3 tabs, 15 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
