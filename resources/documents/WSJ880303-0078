Acting on a measure approved by the Senate in January, the House adopted the bill on a vote of 315-98. Both houses gave the bill more than enough votes to override a threatened presidential veto. If signed into law, the measure would broaden federal civil rights protections for women, racial minorities, the handicapped and the elderly by expanding the scope of laws that apply to entities receiving federal funds.    In a ruling involving Grove City College in Pennsylvania, the Supreme Court had narrowed the federal civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination by schools, companies or state or local governments receiving federal funds. The court said the laws applied only to the specific program receiving federal aid, rather than to a whole institution or agency.    The legislation, which restores institutionwide coverage, has been one of the top priorities of national civil rights leaders.    President Reagan issued a letter yesterday morning from Brussels, where he is attending a meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders, threatening to veto the bill because it &quot;dramatically expands the scope of federal jurisdiction&quot; over state and local governments and &quot;poses a particular threat to religious liberty.&quot; But supporters, such as House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) said a veto would be &quot;ill-advised.&quot;    Congress has struggled over legislation that would nullify the Grove City decision since it was handed down, but efforts repeatedly bogged down in a debate over abortion rights. Abortion opponents sought language ensuring that federally assisted institutions wouldn't be compelled to provide abortions; most supporters of the bill opposed such language because it would repeal federal laws requiring institutions that insure employees or students for pregnancy-related disabilities to treat abortion equally. The bill's supporters also feared the language could permit discrimination at those institutions against women who seek legal abortions. The conflict sank legislation adopted by the House in 1984.    In a compromise in January of this year, however, the Senate adopted amendments stipulating that hospitals or medical schools receiving federal funds wouldn't be required to perform or pay for abortions, but that women affiliated with these institutions who sought such services wouldn't suffer any &quot;penalty.&quot; The Senate adopted the bill on a 75-14 vote.    The House yesterday defeated a substitute bill offered by the GOP that would have broadened an exemption for institutions controlled by religious groups. It would have allowed even institutions with only a close affiliation to a religious group to seek an exemption if compliance with the law would conflict with tenets of the faith.    Sponsor James Sensenbrenner (R., Wis.) argued that the amendment was needed to protect religious freedom. But Hamilton Fish Jr. (R., N.Y.), a supporter of the original bill, said the amendment would &quot;seriously undermine&quot; anti-discrimination laws.    Although the debate on the bill was spirited, the harshest exchanges were over procedure. GOP members objected to an expedited process speeding the Senate-passed bill to the House floor without amendment in a House committee, and then limiting debate and possible amendments.    &quot;You're talking about civil rights; let's have a little civil rights in the House of Representatives,&quot; said Delbert Latta (R., Ohio). </TEXT></DOC>
