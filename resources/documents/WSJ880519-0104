The 3-0 ruling could upset cable viewers who may no longer be able to watch the same reruns and old movies on multiple cable channels. It also assures fat fees for communications attorneys who must sort out the new, confused contractual obligations of cable operators, broadcasters and program syndicators.    The ruling additionally represents the first big setback in Washington in years for the cable industry, which has previously won the rights to set its own rates and decide which broadcasters it will carry. &quot;It's a significant aggravation,&quot; says James Mooney, president of the National Cable Television Association, &quot;but it's not the end of the world for us.&quot; Mr. Mooney says the trade association will challenge the ruling in court, but didn't expect to be able to repeal the rules in Congress.    FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick says the new rules &quot;give viewers richer and more diverse programming.&quot;    After the FCC had eliminated the so-called syndicated exclusivity rules in 1980, in a boost to the then-struggling cable industry, cable operators were free to carry the same syndicated shows, imported from distant TV stations, carried by local broadcasters. Since then, local broadcasters have claimed that arrangement hurt their ratings and advertising revenue.    For instance, Preston Padden, head of the Association of Independent Television Stations, says that one York, Pa., broadcaster paid $600,000 to carry &quot;Family Ties,&quot; but a local cable operator carried the same show four other times during the day on different channels. That made it impossible for the local broadcaster to make a profit.    &quot;The re-adoption of the rule will be a big boost for the viability of local independent stations,&quot; Mr. Padden says.    Under the new rules, which are to take effect in one year, a local broadcaster who negotiates exclusive rights for a syndicated show must give a local cable operator 60 days notice before forbidding the operator from running the same show. The cable operator then can contract with other video services to fill the time slot with different material or bargain with the local broadcaster to waive exclusivity.    In addition, the FCC says that so-called superstations, which beam their signals across the country, can negotiate for national syndication rights on future programs. Currently, broadcasters can only negotiate for syndication in their market area, even though cable systems pick up the shows nationally. Bert Carp, an attorney for Turner Broadcasting System Inc., which had feared that syndicated exclusivity could cripple its WTBS superstation, calls the feature &quot;a significant benefit.&quot;    But other cable executives threatened dire consequences from the rules. Jeff Treeman, senior vice president of Tulsa-based United Video says that &quot;a number&quot; of cable systems would drop WGN, which carries Chicago Cubs baseball games, because of fears that other WGN programming would conflict with broadcasters' local exclusive rights. United Video beams superstations to cable systems. For stations that don't drop superstations, Mr. Treeman says, viewers &quot;will be sporadically blacked out during the day.&quot;    The FCC's Mr. Patrick, however, says the blackout threat is bogus because the cable stations could substitute alternative programming. &quot;Blackouts will only occur if cable operators seek to cause turmoil for short-term political advantage,&quot; he says.    Most of the FCC's efforts were directed toward negotiations over future syndicated programming. For current syndicated programming, the agency says, local broadcasters could only claim exclusive rights if they had made a provision for it in their contracts or if their syndicators would vouch that they had intended to do so.    Mr. Padden says he doubts that the syndicators would charge extra for the exclusivity claims. But the cable association's Mr. Mooney calls that naive. &quot;If the syndicators don't charge, they will have undergone a genetic operation,&quot; he says. &quot;They don't give away anything for free.&quot;    Re-regulating contract rights represent something of a turnaround for the FCC, which has come to epitomize deregulation during the Reagan administration. The agency can't quite bring itself to admit to re-regulation, however. Instead, it says these are unique rules that will let the marketplace operate more freely by allowing broadcasters and cable operators alike to buy exclusive franchises. </TEXT></DOC>
