The stress iscompressive in nature and the average residual stress is in the rangeof 1100 MPa, i.e. about the value of the bulk rupture strength of defect-freesingle crystalline sapphire. Data for specimens implanted with iron indicatethat a saturation value in average stress is reached at 10{sup 16} Fe/Cm{sub2} (160 keV) but a saturation for Cr-implantation is not apparent. Theresidual compressive stress has a marked influence on the apparent fracturetoughness as measured by the indentation technique and the fracture strengthmeasured in bend tests. 23 refs., 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
