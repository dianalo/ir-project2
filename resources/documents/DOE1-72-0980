The calculationsare performed for Prandtl number of 0.71 (air) and at Rayleigh numberup to 10{sup 12}, using both laminar and turbulent theories. For thelaminar flow, the equations derived using Boussinesq's approximationare solved by Newton's method and a sparse-matrix technique. At Rayleighnumber of greater than 10{sup 9}, the computation utilizes the algebraicstress model. The calculation procedure for this turbulent flow employsNewton's method for the mean flow parameters as in the laminar case,an alternating direction implicit (ADI) method for the transport equations,and the Gauss-Seidel iterative technique for the algebraic stress relationships.The combination of these techniques seemed to converge reasonably well.The calculations are extended for the enclosure with diverse boundaryconditions due to a local hot spot on the walls and/or floor of the enclosure.The computation is performed to obtain the velocity and temperature distributionsand the heat transfer at the walls which are important in predictingthermal comfort and energy savings.</TEXT></DOC>
