Because of the limited access to research reactors, however,it is difficult case, power reactors are promising for use in NAA. Theauthors investigated the possibility of using a power reactor for NAAof geological samples for gold and associated elements. Because of thedifficult access to the channels passing through the active zone of thereactor, the samples were irradiated in the reserve channel for ionizationchambers situated outside the active zone in the graphite reflector.The determination of gold by the NAA method is based on the radiativecapture reaction {sup 197}Au(n, {gamma}){sup 198}Au (T/sub 1/2/ = 65h) and subsequent detection of 412-keV {gamma} rays. Gold containingsamples and standards pulverized to a particle size of 200 mesh wereprepared for the analysis. The sensitivity thresholds of a wide rangeof elements accompanying gold, which are well activated by thermal andresonance neutrons, were also evaluated.</TEXT></DOC>
