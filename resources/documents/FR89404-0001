The gypsy moth, <T3>Lymantria dispar </T3>(Linnaeus), is a highly destructive pest of forestand shade trees. Currently, the Northeastern and mid-Atlantic States andMichigan are considered generally infested areas. Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service (APHIS) regulations quarantine these States and restrictthe interstate movement of certain regulated articles from regulated areaswithin these States. Also, APHIS carries out detection activities throughoutthe remainder of the nation to find new infestations of gypsy moth. Priorto the effective date of this document, APHIS also assumed complete responsibilityfor cooperating with the States to control or eradicate these isolatedinfestations.The Secretary has determined that certain gypsy moth eradication activitiescan be most effectively administered by the Forest Service. The Chief ofthe Forest Service administers forest insect, disease, and other pest managementprograms under 16 U.S.C. 2104. Forest Service personnel have considerableexpertise and experience in conducting forest pest management programs.Pursuant to the amended delegation of authority, Forest Service personnelare assuming primary responsibility for treating isolated gypsy moth infestationson Federal lands, and on State and private lands contiguous to infestedFederal lands, and any other infestations of over 640 acres on State andprivate lands. APHIS is continuing to conduct survey and regulatory activities,and retains primary responsibility for eradication of gypsy moth infestationsof 640 acres or less on State and private lands that are not contiguousto infested Federal lands.The authority to conduct programs to eradicate plant pests, such as gypsymoth, is contained in section 102 of the Organic Act of 1944, as amended,and the Act of April 6, 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 147a, 148, 148a-148e).Also, the Talmadge Aiken Act (7 U.S.C. 450) confers authority to cooperatewith States in control and eradication efforts. Formerly, the Secretaryhad delegated these authorities solely to the Assistant Secretary for Marketingand Inspection Services, who in turn delegated the authority to the Administratorof APHIS. This document amends the delegations of authority of the Departmentof Agriculture in 7 CFR Part 2 by delegating to the Chief of the ForestService the primary authority for the eradication activities mentionedabove. This document also amends the delegations to the Assistant Secretaryfor Marketing and Inspection Services and the Administrator of APHIS toreflect the limitation on their authority for gypsy moth eradication activities.This rule relates to internal agency management. Therefore, pursuant to5 U.S.C. 553, notice of proposed rulemaking and opportunity to commentare not required, and this rule may be made effective less than 30 daysafter publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Further, since this rule relates to internalagency management, it is exempt from the provisions of Executive Order12291. Finally, this action is not a rule as defined by Pub. L. 96-354,the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and thus is exempt from the provisionsof that Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 2</ITAG>Authority delegations (Government agencies).Accordingly, 7 CFR Part 2 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 2_DELEGATIONS OF AUTHORITY BY THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE ANDGENERAL OFFICERS OF THE DEPARTMENT</ITAG>1.
