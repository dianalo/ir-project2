Demands for restrictions on military-style, semiautomaticfirearms are escalating, however, in the aftermath of the Stockton,Calif., schoolyard tragedy Jan. 17 in which a deranged gunman withan assault rifle left five youngsters dead and 30 other personsinjured.   So intense is the clamor that, as often as the NRA has crushedor blunted gun control bills in the past, many doubt that it canprevail this time with its strategy of blaming the murder wavesweeping cocaine-ridden communities not on firearms but ``ourcrumbling criminal justice system.''   ``We're certainly going to try,'' says lobbyist Baker.   Even Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who urged Democrats tosoftpedal the gun issue after the 1988 election, says publicopinion is ripe for action on semiautomatics. ``I think the NRA isstubbing its toe here,'' he says. ``The appearance of beingunwilling to deal with assault rifles has hurt them.''   From its modern headquarters on Rhode Island Avenue in downtownWashington, a few blocks from the White House, the NRA deployslobbyists to Capitol Hill and statehouses across the nation,provides generous campaign contributions to its political friendsand generates tons of literature to fill the mailboxes of America'sgun enthusiasts.   With annual revenues of $70 million and a staff of 365employees, including 65 in its lobbying department, the NRA is wellequipped to fight its political battles. It also has powerfulfriends. President Bush is a member. And its roots go deep in thefabric of American life.   Founded in 1871 by National Guard officers, the NRA has longcounted many military men and policemen among its members. It holdsfirearms courses for police, private security firms and privatecitizens.   It is recognized by the U.S. Olympic Committee as the nationalgoverning body of shooting sports in the United States andmaintains a junior program for youngsters. It also providesself-defense courses for women and maintains a 1,100-piece gunmuseum within its headquarters as well as a special,``Muzzleloaders'' division within its membership for history buffs.   Last year, the NRA got the House to shelve a proposed seven-daywaiting period for would-be gun buyers. Failure of the bill namedfor former presidential spokesman James Brady, brain damaged in the1981 attempt on President Reagan, spurred Brady's wife to urgereaders in full-page magazine ads to help ``break the NRA's deathgrip on Congress.''   The real secret of the NRA's power has long been its ability tomobilize hundreds of thousands of gun owners across the nation towrite and telephone lawmakers. ``Please open immediately.Legislative alert,'' trumpets a mailing that went to Virginia gunowners in February.   It warns of an impending bill in Richmond in which ``theanti-gunners ... have launched an all-out attack on semiautomaticfirearms in line with their goal of banning all firearms.''   ``Your immediate action is needed to defeat this dangerousbill,'' it says. But the General Assembly nevertheless approved themeasure calling for a background check of would-be gun buyers.California lawmakers are expected to pass a more stringent measureand bills are pending in Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland,Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Texas.   A number of cities, including Los Angeles and Cleveland, alsohave approved restrictions on semiautomatic weapons. And on Sunday,the International Association of Chiefs of Police announced itsopposition to the public sale and distribution of the guns.   The chain reaction has led to a further question of NRA power.``The NRA is being forced increasingly to the fringes of thisdebate,'' says Dr. Garen Wintemute of Sacramento, Calif., whotreated AK-47 assault rifle wounds as a doctor in a Cambodianjungle hospital in 1981. On coming home, he was shocked to find thesame AK-47 wounds in the United States.   ``More and more people are willing to come out and say, theemperor has no clothes, meaning the NRA,'' says the doctor, who hasbecome an outspoken critic of assault-rifle sales.   Others are more skeptical about the alleged erosion of NRA power.   ``The NRA members haven't lost anything with me,'' declares Rep.Harold Volkmer, D-Mo. Few if any House members take a dimmer viewof gun control.   Pending bills aimed at military-style assault weapons also would``take away my Browning shotgun and my thirty-ought-six deerrifle,'' says Volkmer. ``I think we can kill that up here. I thinkwe can beat it.''   What happens in the House will depend heavily on the view fromthe hustings. Democrats say a blizzard of NRA mailings against 1988presidential nominee Michael Dukakis were probably not decisive.But they hurt, especially in states where gun owners are plentiful.   Texas political consultant George Christian says the Dukakisstand in favor of toughened gun control ``wasn't the No.1 issue''in his state ``but as part of a package of issues that subjectedhim to attack from the other side, it played a very importantrole.''   ``The Republicans used gun control advertising very heavily, soobviously their polling showed that it was an important issue,'' hesays.   But on Capitol Hill, a stream of gun-control bills is flowinginto the hopper, sponsored by Rep. Fortney (Pete) Stark, D-Calif.,and an array of other Californians.   The most heavily spotlighted bill, however, is being offered bySen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio. It would place certainsemiautomatics, such as the AK-47 and the Israeli-made Uzi, in thesame restricted-sales category with fully automatic machine guns.   It also would allow the Treasury Department to put additionalsemiautomatics in the same class. Private citizens may own machineguns but only if they are fingerprinted, pay a $200 fee, undergo anFBI background check and get permission from their local lawenforcement officials.   This has not deterred all firearms fans. Grant Stapleton, aPennsylvania NRA member, declares that he would hate to part withthe .50-caliber machine gun that is the centerpiece of hiscollection. Why does he want it?   ``What does anyone pay $150,000 for a Ferrari? Why does anyonewant a Matisse?'' Stapleton muses. His company makes asinister-looking round-drummed, semiautomatic shotgun called theStriker, which pumps out 12 rounds of 12-gauge shot in threeseconds. The weapon, designed by a Rhodesian farmer to chase offrebels, is precisely what Metzenbaum wants to outlaw.</TEXT></DOC>
