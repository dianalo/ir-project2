 It also helps explain the technicalintricacies of a particular automated information system to the review groupsin the Office of the Secretary of Defense.andM;&quot;We're the middleman in the sense that components and the OSD staff don'talways speak the same language,&quot; said Ronald Oxley, who heads thedirectorate.andM;The directorate's main function is to shepherd its systems, most of themworth $100 million or more, through the Major Automated Information SystemsReview Council (MAISRC) milestones.andM;Dealing only with programs in the production and logistics arena, thedirectorate begins work after the contract award.andP;  It makes sure all aspectsof a program are running smoothly by recommending improvements andreassessments as the program moves through its review milestones.andM;Often the reviewers lack the expertise to understand the technical componentsof a particular system, Oxley said.andP;  He said the directorate relays theinformation to OSD in layman's terms.andM;Although it took three years for Oxley to convince Defense officials that theidea would work, he said &quot;we've established all of the pieces we need to makesure that we get an automated system in place within a reasonable amount oftime.&quot;andM;The numbers prove the system is working, Oxley said.andM;&quot;We've been able to get 60 percent more of our systems through MAISRCapproval in the last eight months than we have ever before,&quot; he said.andM;Program managers rarely are oriented toward a review process, said Mike Noll,division chief of the Systems Implementation Division, and the directoratecan help them prepare for an intensive review.andM;&quot;If we work with them on a daily basis to make sure that they are followingthe life cycle management criteria and will present their case for approvalat milestone to the MAISRC, then you're more likely to have a successfulMAISRC,&quot; Noll said.andM;System SuccessandM;Cynthia Kendall, DOD's deputy comptroller, said the system seems to beworking well.andM;&quot;While we don't see this as a 'new system' overall, liaison with theproduction and logistics programs has improved, and the plans and systemsdirectorate seem to be working well,&quot; she said.andM;Communications between the directorate and the MAISRC also have improved,Kendall said, leading to an improvement in MAISRC preparation andpresentations.andM;Programs under the directorate include the Defense Logistics Agency's DefenseAutomated Addressing System, the Naval Aviation Logistics Command ManagementInformation System, the Air Force Logistics Command's Logistics ManagementSystems Modernization program, the Army's Computer-Aided Acquisition andLogistics Support program (CALS) and the Air Force Technical Order ManagementSystem (AFTOMS).andM;Bobby Parsons, deputy chief for information systems and technology at DLA andprogram manager for the Defense Automated Addressing System, said his programcould not have made it through its Milestone 2 review without thedirectorate's help.andM;Parsons said the program was at a stalemate after having failed to passprevious MAISRC reviews, but after the directorate began helping the programit passed without a hitch.andM;&quot;Without their support, we certainly wouldn't be through [the review] now,&quot;Parsons said.andM;Col.andP;  Ed Wills, program manager for Army CALS in Fort Monmouth, N.J., saidthe directorate helped prepare his program for its upcoming In-ProcessReview, a stepping-stone to MAISRC's Milestone 1.andM;Wills said the directorate has helped him anticipate the questions the reviewboard will ask and what types of answers they are looking for.andM;He said he now has a better understanding of the personalities and interestsof each involved office &quot;so we can tailor our briefings.&quot;andM;AFTOMS program manager Col.andP;  Robert McKittrick said the directorate has givenhim valuable feedback on both the AFTOMS program and the Depot MainManagement Information System program at the Air Force Logistics Command,Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.andM;The liaison system &quot;has been valuable in making the presentation moreunderstandable and presentable to the MAISRC,&quot; he said.andM;The directorate also compiles a standardization plan from the ADPmodernization and strategic plans to guide production and logistics into thenext century.andM;&quot;We have two people who watch everything going through the budget to makesure that a system that is going through the MAISRC is tied to thestandardization plan, the ADP plan and is a priority on our strategic planfor the future,&quot; he said.andM;Noll said the directorate looks at how a system will operate throughout DODin relation to what the individual services are doing.andP;  The directoratedecides whether to recommend standardizing the system for use in all DODcomponents, he said.andM;Staying on TrackandM;Noll also said the directorate makes sure all systems are on track withprograms for the entire Defense Department.andP;  Most of its systems comply withCALS standards, he said.andM;Noll said he thinks the directorate's real responsibility lies in making surethe programs are not &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; each time they come up with anautomated system.andM;&quot;We are for the first time in DOD trying to come up with a componentwide andcapstone DOD architecture that shows functionally and technically where we'regoing in ADP,&quot; Noll said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
