Some researchers are trying to develop drugs that coaxthat traffic cop back out of retirement to take on biologicaloutlaws such as viruses and oncogenes, which disrupt thegenetic machinery of cells, leading to diseases such ascancer and AIDS.   The traffic cop is an enzyme known as ADPRT, which seeksout abnormal genes and martials from six to eight otherenzymes to cut up and destroy the defective ordisease-causing genes.   Ernest Kun, formerly a professor at the University ofCaliforna at San Francisco, is leading a five-person teamresearching ADPRT at closely held Octamer of San Francisco.Octamer is developing five potential drugs that bind withADPRT and reactivate it as a regulator of cellular law andorder. The targets, he believes, might be as diverse asB-cell leukemia, herpes and HIV, which causes AIDS.   In test-tube studies performed with William Rice of EmoryUniversity on the bone-marrow cells of leukemic children, thecancer cells were destroyed, but about two-thirds of thenormal cells were spared, enough to regenerate the bonemarrow after treatment, Dr. Kun contends.   In AIDS, Dr. Kun reasons, ADPRT-based drugs mightselectively target and clean out viral infection in cellswithout killing the cells themselves. It's a hypothesis hehopes to prove in a forthcoming study with Fred Valentine ofNew York University and the Emory group.   His goal is to develop drugs with the potential not onlyto inhibit but to wipe out viruses.                                                                                                          Tumor-Necrosis Factor   Gets Another Chance                                                                                                          TAMING a promising but unruly drug may be possible, aGenentech team believes.   The drug, tumor-necrosis factor, is a schizophrenicsubstance. It's a natural human protein with potentialvirtues as an anticancer and antiviral agent, but it has adarker side that provokes inflammation, shock and cachexia,the wasting syndrome that causes cancer patients to losedrastic amounts of weight. Such side effects have frustratedefforts to use it as a practical treatment.   Genentech's David Goeddel and Louis Tartaglia have moved astep closer to mastering TNF's contradictory nature,according to their recent report in the Proceedings of theNational Academy of Sciences. The scientists say their mousestudies indicate the protein binds to two different receptorson human cells. This, in turn, triggers distinct responses bycells -- such as immune-cell or killer-cell activity. Thefinding raises the likelihood that scientists can designcustomized drugs against cancer, harnessing specific powersof TNF without inviting other, toxic reactions.   &quot;Because TNF causes so many physiological responses, ithas been difficult to figure out how to use it to obtainspecific therapeutic benefits in the absence of unwanted sideeffects,&quot; according to Genentech's Dr. Goeddel. &quot;Now that weknow the two receptors have different functions, we cantheoretically design a molecule that would bind to only oneof the TNF receptors and {elicit} only the desired response.&quot;                                                                                                          Designing an Oral Drug   To Keep Anemia at Bay                                                                                                          ANEMIA, a shortage of oxygen-carrying red cells in theblood, is currently treated with blood transfusions orintravenous infusions of erythropoietin, which stimulatesproduction of red blood cells.   EPO, pioneered by Amgen, is fine for kidney dialysispatients and for other acutely ill patients for whom needlesare a part of life. But what about less severe forms ofanemia, where IV treatments with blood or EPO are expensiveand inconvenient?   Designing an oral anemia drug, which would mimic theactions of the big EPO molecule in a small, easily ingestedform, is one goal of scientists at Arris Pharmaceutical, aclosely held startup in South San Francisco headed byGenentech alumnus Michael J. Ross.   Using advanced computer techniques to &quot;map&quot; the structureof EPO and potential anemia-fighting substances, Dr. Ross isnarrowing his sights to smaller synthetic drug molecules thatmay perform the same function in an orally active form.   In the U.S. alone, more than 2.6 million people sufferfrom varying types of anemia. Many of those people aren'tthat sick and might be more likely to take an oral drug, Dr.Ross says. An oral drug might ease effects of chemotherapy,he says, or help patients facing surgery who need to boosttheir red blood count as a precaution against bleeding duringthe operation.   &quot;In these situations, an oral drug would be competitive,&quot;he says. &quot;Anytime you can avoid giving an IV drug, historysays the oral drug wins the race.&quot;                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          TIMING is everything, says William J.M. Hrushesky of theVeteran's Administration hopital in Albany, N.Y. He foundthat giving the anticancer drug interleukin-2 to mice justbefore they awoke increased their tumor-fighting power, whilegiving it to active animals actually favored tumor growth. .. . The secret to Leonardo da Vinci's strange mirror-writingmay lie in his lefthandedness. Scientist Victor Smetacek, ina letter to Nature, says lefties who are forced to write withtheir right hand may retain a mysterious ability to producethe backward script with the left. Their flow of thought mayeven find better expression this way, he theorizes, becauseit draws upon the creative centers of the right half of thebrain.</TEXT></DOC>
