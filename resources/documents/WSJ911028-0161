Critics have charged that schools have taken on thefunctions of social work agencies, health clinics, familiesand police, losing sight of their responsibility fordeveloping children's intellects.   Thus, it was nothing less than remarkable when in 1989President Bush and the nation's 50 governors met inCharlottesville, Va., and agreed on six national goals forAmerican education in the year 2000. By then, the leaderspledged, all children would arrive &quot;ready to learn&quot; at drug-and violence-free schools, from which 90% would graduate.Further, by the next millenium, American students would be&quot;first in the world&quot; in mathematics and science, and noslouches either in the mastery of history, geography andEnglish.</LP><TEXT>   To understand how difficult it will be to reach those lasttwo goals, read Rita Kramer's &quot;Ed School Follies: TheMiseducation of America's Teachers&quot; (The Free Press, 228pages, $22.95). Ms. Kramer, a seasoned journalist and theauthor of several books about education and childdevelopment, has written a vivid, engaging and sharplycritical study of a dozen schools of education.   Ms. Kramer spent a year traveling from campus to campus,visiting education schools in every region of the country.Her method is to report what she sees and hears, to reproducethe tone of the classroom and the dialogues among teachersand students. The effect is alternately fascinating anddepressing.   She finds few professors who recognize the importance ofachievement or who stress mastery of subject matter. On thecontrary, Ms. Kramer frequently encounters the attitude thatcompetition is distasteful, standards are elitist and thecontent of the curriculum is irrelevant.   What is it, then, that our future teachers are learning?They learn about the necessity of teaching children to haveself-esteem and about the teacher's role as an agent ofsocial change. And they absorb the ponderous jargon of theprofession.   In one class, the professor says to the future teachers,&quot;More important than content or thinking is the students'feelings. You are not there to feed them information but tobe sensitive to their need for positive reinforcement, forself-esteem.&quot; The anti-intellectualism comes as well from thestudents. At one graduate institution, the professor speaksabout the virtues of knowing the subject, having a passionfor it, &quot;whether it's `The Idylls of the King,' ThomasJefferson, or a Mozart divertimento.&quot; His class of teachersand administrators object to the professor's emphasis ontests and achievement. Their job, they argue, is to helptheir students &quot;feel good about themselves.&quot;   Ms. Kramer describes professors with an ideologicalagenda, who proselytize on subjects like war, the arms raceor poverty. She observes a peace education seminar where theparticipants agree that war is horrible and imagine theVietnam War from the perspective of the Vietnamese. Takingexception, Ms. Kramer criticizes the assumption that, &quot;If youidentified with the individual on the other side, youwouldn't fight them.&quot; What, she asks, happens if they don'tidentify with you? &quot;What about the Nazis,&quot; she wonders, andwhat about Pearl Harbor? But no one in the class asks suchrude questions.   Ms. Kramer repeatedly finds evidence that the jargon ofthe human potential movement has become the lingua franca ofed schools, &quot;role playing, getting involved, task-oriented,priority goals, peer interaction, feedback, role models,support groups . . .&quot; In one class, the professor rattles onabout &quot;contributive strategies to norms of interaction.&quot;   What most disturbs her is a common aversion to academicstandards and substantive content. She exults when sheoccasionally finds a professor who speaks eloquently aboutthe joys of teaching history or literature or art. Theundergraduates, in particular, seem woefully uneducated, andlittle that they study is calculated to raise theireducational level before they are sent out to teach.   And yet throughout her narrative are examples of studentsand professors who are committed to learning as it iscommonly understood. In this flak terrain, they stand out asheroes. One memorable professor tells the story of a littleboy &quot;picking up starfish on the beach and throwing them backin the water.&quot; Someone says he can never throw all of themback, so why bother? What difference does it make? And hisanswer is, &quot;It makes a difference to this one.&quot;   There are also the young people who love kids and want totake responsibility for teaching them. A young woman inTennessee says she wants to be a teacher because of the kids.&quot;School may be the biggest positive force in their lives . .. School is a place for education, where you can give themthe tools to learn. You have to take on the responsibility.If you don't, it won't get done.&quot;   Ms. Kramer's comment about the young woman expresses herown attitude, &quot;She wasn't thinking about changing `society.'Just children.&quot;   ---   Ms. Ravitch is assistant secretary of education, U.S.Department of Education.</TEXT></DOC>
