Right now, though, he's fighting to stay out of the ending.    As much as any other former officer of the scandal-plagued defense contractor, the hefty tool-and-die maker can take credit for Wedtech's rise from a small Bronx machine shop to a New York Stock Exchange company that won $494 million in defense contracts over the past 10 years.    On Wedtech's floor, former and current workers say, Mr. Mariotta's Hispanic heritage helped cement the loyalty of many employees, most of whom were Hispanic themselves. Along the way, Wedtech came under the wing of the Reagan administration, which proclaimed the company as an example of how hard work could accomplish what welfare could not.    Yesterday, as the Wedtech scandal continued to unfold, Stanley Simon, the former Bronx borough president, was indicted for extortion and perjury. A federal grand jury charged him with extorting about $50,000 in cash, contributions and expense payments from Wedtech representatives and with extorting a job -- and subsequent salary increases -- from Wedtech for his brother-in-law. Last Month Mr. Simon, 57 years old, resigned his borough presidency to fight the anticipated charges.    Mr. Mariotta, the company's founder, hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing, but he is expected to soon face criminal indictment, several attorneys close to the case say. The company and four former Wedtech officers, who recently pleaded guilty to bribery, grand larceny and fraud -- and who are cooperating with the government -- have accused Mr. Mariotta and several public officials of being a part of the scandal.    Mr. Mariotta, 57, denies he did anything illegal. His lawyer says the former Wedtech officials are &quot;framing&quot; him.    Priding itself on hiring rehabilitated drug addicts, welfare recipients and ex-convicts, Mr. Mariotta's Wedtech once was one of the Bronx's biggest employers, with 800 workers there (and 600 elsewhere). In 1984, Inc. magazine named Wedtech one of America's fastest-growing companies. That year, at a Republican dinner, President Reagan cited Wedtech's impressive record and called Mr. Mariotta a &quot;hero for the '80s.&quot;    The company, currently operating under bankruptcy-law protection with only 283 workers, made its money manufacturing precision-machine parts, small engines and causeway pontoons -- or temporary floating bridges -- for the Defense Department.    With his father's training, Mr. Mariotta in 1965 founded Welbilt Electronic Die Corp., which became Wedtech in 1983. He was chief executive officer and chairman of Wedtech until Feb. 11, 1986, when he was ousted from the commpany in a feud with other officials, including the man who was his Welbilt partner, Fred Neuberger.    For several years before the ouster, Mr. Neuberger and the three other former officials now admit, they defrauded the federal government and bribed influential politicians. Meanwhile, the four former officials admitted to looting at least $2 million from the company.    Mr. Mariotta, who lives in suburban Scarsdale, N.Y., has declined to be interviewed, on the advice of his attorney. A vocational-school dropout, Mr. Mariotta became a millionaire businessman after Wedtech's initial public offering in 1983.    Mr. Mariotta's Hispanic heritage allowed Wedtech to flourish in the Small Business Administration's program for minority-owned firms. Much of its defense business was won through no-bid contracts available in a controversial SBA procurement program.    Mr. Mariotta's lawyer, Jeffrey Glekel, says his client didn't know about the looting or the bribes. The other officers &quot;didn't trust&quot; Mr. Mariotta enough to include him in their schemes, the lawyer says, adding: &quot;Everything was routed around him. The people he brought in really took over the show.&quot;    Current Wedtech management -- which hasn't been implicated in the scandal -- disputes that characterization, as do government investigators who are sifting through company records and planning another round of charges soon. Wedtech, whose current president is former Army Col. Joseph Felter, faces an uphill battle to become a viable business again.    &quot;The whole thing went up in smoke,&quot; Mr. Glekel says. He adds that Mr. Mariotta &quot;is not on talking terms&quot; with his former colleagues. </TEXT></DOC>
