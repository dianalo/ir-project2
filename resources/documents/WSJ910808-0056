Walsh may beglimpsed in a memo circulated at Union Pacific Railroadheadquarters shortly after Mr. Walsh, the railroad chairman,had it buy a 50% stake in the Omaha Royals baseball team lastJune.   &quot;The positions of pitcher and second baseman areconsolidated,&quot; said the memo, a parody by bemused staffers.&quot;The position of shortstop is abolished.&quot; Ditto the rightfielder, third baseman and catcher. The changes, the memosaid, will &quot;minimize duplication of responsibilities,maximize profit potential, improve pace of play and heightenfan excitement.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   In hiring Mr. Walsh as chairman and chief executive,Tenneco directors are bringing aboard a brash, innovativecostcutter and self-described &quot;organizational architect&quot; wholikes to make changes and expects to make waves.   Although the 49-year-old Mr. Walsh wasn't commentingyesterday on his plans for Tenneco, he is widely expected totest the limits of the slash-and-rebuild remedy increasinglyprescribed for corporate America. At Union Pacific, where hehas already demonstrated the risks and rewards ofhigh-pressure reorganizing, his departure also leavesquestion marks.   Wall Street applauded Mr. Walsh's switch to Tenneco, wherehe will replace James L. Ketelsen as Tenneco president Oct.1, as chief executive Jan. 1 and as chairman May 12. On theNew York Stock Exchange, Tenneco's stock surged $3.25 a shareto close at $39.875.   Wall Street hasn't been happy with Tenneco, where aturnaround promised by Mr. Ketelsen in 1988 hasn't beenachieved. Last week, the far-flung natural-gas, shipbuildingand manufacturing conglomerate posted a second-quarter lossof $14 million. In all 1990, net income slumped 4% to $561million, or $4.37 a share, on a 3% rise in sales to $14.5billion. This year's outlook, Mr. Ketelsen has said, is&quot;difficult.&quot;   Securities analysts took Mr. Walsh's succession as asignal to start estimating Tenneco's breakup value. Most putit at more than $10 billion, even larger than that ofBeatrice Co., the food giant acquired for its potential byKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. in 1986.   &quot;The ideal dream of Wall Street would be to separateTenneco's six totally different divisions. They have nosynergies, but most of the operations are top-notch on theirown,&quot; said David Fleischer, an analyst at Prudential BacheSecurities.   A mixture of delight and dismay spread quickly yesterdaythrough Tenneco's Houston headquarters.   Many employees were delighted at the prospect that Mr.Walsh might sell off their businesses, which then perhapsmight run autonomously and grow on their own. &quot;People areturning cartwheels in this building,&quot; said a mid-levelexecutive with Tenneco's natural-gas pipeline unit.   But others, fearing for their jobs, stopped each other inhallways and whispered questions about Mr. Walsh and theirfutures. Many computer screens, abandoned by gossipingworkers, automatically switched back to the test pattern: theblue Tenneco logo.   Given Tenneco's problems and Mr. Walsh's record, they canexpect cutbacks. Since he started running the Union Pacificin October 1986, he has taken out layers of management,combined hundreds of jobs and automated work ranging fromtrain dispatching to customer service. Two years ago, heopened a central dispatching station in Omaha to controltrains throughout the system; its computers eliminated 10regional offices and 150 jobs. Says William Withuhn, a railhistorian at the Smithsonian Institution: &quot;Mr. Walsh hastransformed the Union Pacific Railroad into a hungry,aggressive company.&quot;   Its profits have barreled ahead about 45% in the past fouryears, and the railroad is winning praise -- and freighttraffic -- from shippers. While other railroads have shrunk,Union Pacific is expanding its capacity.   Lean and muscular, Mr. Walsh is an intense man. He oncebet a dollar that he could keep quiet for 20 minutes at arailroad staff meeting; he lost after five minutes. Lastfall, he held forth for five hours at a leadership conferencebroadcast by satellite to 24 of the road's facilities.   His intensity isn't confined to the office. When his wife,Joan, asked him to stop playing loud music at home, he boughtearphones instead. &quot;In my house,&quot; he says, &quot;my teen-age kidstell me to turn down the music.&quot;   His style invites criticism -- and parody. An employeespoof entitled &quot;Walsh Is Great&quot; reports that Mr. Walsh wasnamed Man of the Year by the Omaha-based Mike WalshFoundation. &quot;The `H' in his middle name isn't for `Humble,'&quot;a Union Pacific executive jokes. (It's for Harries, hismother's maiden name.)   Some employees resent the way Mr. Walsh has criticized asexcessive the pay rates of unionized rail workers while hisown compensation rose 29% in the past two years. &quot;He talksabout being a world-class company, but he's not willing tolead by example,&quot; says Dennis Timmermann, a brakeman. &quot;WhenMike Walsh speaks, people begin to smell grease paint.&quot;   And Mr. Walsh's aggressive tactics have angered rail laborfor his successful, high-profile lobbying of Congress lastApril to settle a nationwide rail strike on terms that, bysome estimates, will strip away work rules that cost morethan $1 billion a year. Nor was Mr. Walsh universally likedby other rail executives. Some call him publicity-hungry;others say he took credit that was rightfully theirs for theindustry's recent victories.   Mr. Walsh laughs off the criticism. &quot;Show me a railroaderthat doesn't have complaints, I'll show you a deadrailroader,&quot; he jokes. He terms his $1.1 million in salaryand bonuses last year &quot;puny&quot; relative to the surge inearnings during his tenure.   Mr. Walsh is a Stanford University graduate whose dreamsof football glory were derailed by recurrent dislocatedshoulders. After graduating from Yale Law School, he servedas a public defender, a member of a law firm and a U.S.Attorney in San Diego. His industrial career began at CumminsEngine Co., in Columbus, Ind., where he helped engineer thecompany's response to Japanese rivals and developed a passionfor improving U.S. competitiveness. He has made over 25 tripsto Japan to study the country.   &quot;We need fewer of us working harder to be competitive,&quot;Mr. Walsh says. &quot;That's better than the alternative, which isall of us going over the cliff.&quot; He combines such concernswith a longtime interest in publicservice causes such asboard memberships at Boys' Town and Common Cause. &quot;I spend alot of time on do-good stuff, and all that do-good stuff isdead-on-arrival if we aren't competitive,&quot; he says.   Mr. Walsh was hired at Union Pacific Railroad by DrewLewis, who had held the job for six months and now heads theparent company, Union Pacific Corp. Before Mr. Walsh arrived,the railroad had been losing customers. It had a reputationfor being bureaucratic and slow to respond to shippersdespite the deregulation of the freight-hauling business.   But Mr. Walsh changed all that. He slashed the operatingdepartment's nine layers to five, cut 600 nonunion jobs andincreased field managers' authority. He tore down barriers tocooperation by creating cross-functional teams. And he soughtto change the mind-set of employees used to rigid disciplineand taking orders.   Thus, the Union Pacific's new emphasis on teamwork andconsensus-building required big changes for veteranrailroaders. &quot;I was a hard-nosed operating manager, and Iwanted it done because I said to get it done,&quot; says CharlesDettmann, an assistant vice president and a railroader since1964. &quot;All of a sudden, tough was out and collegial was in.It was scary as hell.&quot;   Mr. Walsh arrives at Tenneco as speculation about majorchanges is spreading throughout the company. Its tired J.I.Case farm-equipment unit was partly responsible for thesecond-quarter loss. Almost everything Tenneco owns, from itsnaturalgas pipelines to its chemical and automotive-partsbusinesses, has been hurt by the recession. Its giant NewportNews shipbuilding operation faces lean times as defensespending is cut back. &quot;I think we needed someone without avested interest in any of the {company's} parts,&quot; says GordonBonfield, a senior vice president.   Thomas J. Neff, president of SpencerStuart, the executivesearch firm that recruited Mr. Walsh, says, &quot;We wanted tohave someone who has experience restructuring andrepositioning a business.&quot; He says recruiting also focused onskills needed to build a new management team and on&quot;immediate credibility&quot; on Wall Street.   Although Tenneco stock had been well below $40 a sharerecently, analysts estimated the company's breakup value at$85. Many view Tenneco -- one of the last true conglomeratesso common in a bygone era of diversification -- as toounwieldy to be managed effectively. Its sheer size isdaunting: 92,000 employees in 33 countries and assets of $19billion.   Slumping earnings had dragged down its stock from itsearlier $60 range and jeopardized its hefty $3.20-a-sharedividend. &quot;Many people believe the current dividend is wayout of line with the currently depressed environment thatTenneco is operating in,&quot; says Larry Crowley, an analyst atRauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc.   Persuading any buyer to take on Tenneco's staggering $9billion debt would be a major obstacle to breaking up thecompany, comments Ron Barone, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp;Co. Nevertheless, such sell-offs &quot;are possible,&quot; he says,using &quot;the proceeds to pay down debt.&quot; He adds: &quot;The No. 1objective is to pay debt, and so is No. 2. They're continuingto pay dividends they aren't earning.&quot;   Insiders have also long grumbled about Mr. Ketelsen's&quot;dividend defense,&quot; a strategy that they perceived as aneffort to divert shareholder criticism of his performance.Mr. Walsh's first move, after arriving in October, may be tocut the dividend, analysts say.   The 60-year-old Mr. Ketelsen has been saying for more ayear that he wouldn't stay on until age 65, and he orderedthe search for his successor. Insiders doubt that he wasbeing pressured to leave by directors, most of whom he helpedselect since becoming chairman in 1978.   But word of Mr. Ketelsen's surprise departure came almostimmediately after the company's board meeting in New YorkTuesday. After the 13 directors agreed to turn to Mr. Walsh,Mr. Ketelsen telephoned the news to half a dozen closelieutenants and flew on the company's Gulfstream II jet toDenver the same day. There, he plans a week or so of hikingbefore returning to Houston.   Mr. Ketelsen wouldn't confirm or deny yesterday whether hehad discussed the possible breakup of Tenneco with hissuccessor. &quot;I think speculation now is premature,&quot; he said.&quot;I think Mike has to get in here and size up what hisstrategy might be.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
