In Minneapolis, Irwin L. Jacobs abandoned the complicated merger of two companies he controls, Minstar Inc. and Genmar Industries Inc., in the wake of their falling stock prices. And London-based TI Group PLC notified Bundy Corp. that TI won't go forward with its $144 million, or $40-a-share, acquisition of Warren, Mich.-based Bundy that was agreed to in September.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Bundy shares lost 45% of their market value as they tumbled $16.50, to close at $20. The issue was the Big Board's largest percentage loser yesterday.    Other deals that were affected yesterday by the stock market's recent crash involved a $92.1 million management buy-out of Restaurant Associates Industries Inc., New York, and a $95.3 million acquisition of Hubbard Milling Co., Mankato, Minn., by International Proteins Corp., Fairfield, N.J.    The derailments announced yesterday were just the latest takeover plans that fell victim to the stock-market collapse. Earlier proposals that were withdrawn included Carl C. Icahn's bid to take Trans World Airlines private, and the Haft family's effort to buy Dayton Hudson Corp.    Mr. Jacobs's proposed merger of Minstar and Genmar was valued at about $509 million. Now, instead of being acquired by Genmar, Minstar will buy as many as five million, or about 30%, of its shares from time to time, and attempt to sell its sports and energy businesses. Minstar, which has been Mr. Jacobs's primary investment vehicle, will continue to hold stakes in several other companies. Genmar will continue to concentrate on the boatmaking business.    The drop in value of Minstar common shares since last week's stock-market collapse would have required Genmar to pay too high a premium. &quot;The price in the market undid the numbers for the deal,&quot; said Minstar President Kenneth Severinson. In August, when the merger was proposed, Minstar was trading at about $27 a share. It dropped about $6 last week.    In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Minstar slumped $4.75, to $14.    Under terms of the canceled merger, a unit would have taken over its parent. Genmar, which is 82%-owned by Minstar, definitively agreed in August to acquire each Minstar share for 0.75 share of a newly formed Genmar holding company, plus $23.50 in either cash or notes, or a combination.    The pact engineered by Mr. Jacobs, who is chairman of both companies and owns 25% of Minstar, might have generated about $100 million for him and his partners. Among other things, the pact was spurred by investor confusion about the market value of Minstar's hodgepodge of businesses.    Minstar's sports lines include Ben Hogan golf clubs, Head tennis and ski equipment, and swimming gear. Minstar's energy services group has gas-compressor and pipeline inspection businesses.    In a letter to Bundy, Christopher Lewinton, chief executive of TI Group, said, &quot;None of us could possibly have contemplated the financial and economic crisis that has become manifest over the last week or so.&quot;    Bundy, which makes small-diameter tubing, quickly sought to cushion its stock from the news by announcing it would spend as much as $2.5 million to buy back its common shares. But the shares plummeted, anyway, to close at $20. Before the proposed acquisition was announced, Bundy stock was trading at about $32.    In New York, Restaurant Associates, which operates restaurants and newsstands, said it will review the terms of the management buy-out &quot;in light of the recent conditions in the securities and financial markets.&quot; Last month, the company accepted the management group's proposal of $18 a share.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading Monday, the Class B stock closed at $9.875, off $2.375, and the Class A shares closed at $9.625, down $2.75; neither issue traded yesterday.    International Proteins, a processor of fish products, said that it had planned to issue additional equity or debt securities after its acquisition of Hubbard Milling, but that it had been advised &quot;such an issue would not be feasible at the present time.&quot;    International Proteins closed at $11.75, down 12.5 cents, on the Amex.    One buy-out proposal was put on hold. In Birmingham, Mich., Entertainment Publications Inc. said a group that includes Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. and members of Entertainment Publications' management has deferred indefinitely its $129 million, or $26-a-share, proposal because of stock-market instability.    In over-the-counter trading, Entertainment Publications, a publisher of coupon books, closed at $17.50, down 25 cents.    One suitor slashed its takeover terms. Econocom International N.V. said in New York that it will continue to pursue the acquisition of Decision Industries Corp., but it cut its bid to $6 a share, or about $57 million, from $11 a share. Decision couldn't be reached for comment.    In Big Board trading, Decision closed at $5, up 62.5 cents.    Since May, Paris-based Econocom, a leaser of computer equipment, has accumulated a 23% stake in Decision, a Horsham, Pa.-based provider of computer equipment and services. Decision has about 9.4 million common shares outstanding.    In Toronto, ARC International Corp., a maker of cable-television products, said it terminated its tender offer to acquire Canrad Inc., Newark, N.J., a maker of ultraviolet lamps and telecommunications equipment, for about $20.5 million in cash and rights. ARC's investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said last week that it wasn't feasible to proceed with a planned financing for ARC because of the stock-market collapse.    And in Honolulu, HAL Inc. said its board canceled previously set record and meeting dates regarding a proposed takeover by Hemmeter Investors Inc., reflecting Hemmeter's difficulties in obtaining financing.    The holding company for Hawaiian Airlines said, however, that the previously reported definitive agreement signed with Hemmeter, a Honolulu-based resorts-development concern, would remain in effect. The pact is valued at $50 a share, or $95 million.    HAL said the postponement was aimed at helping Hemmeter find financing &quot;on a more reasonable timetable.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
