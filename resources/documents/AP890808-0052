Seas in the area of the storm were reported running as high as26 feet today as the storm pushed northeast at speeds of 35 mphtoward the tiny French island of St. Pierre and the cooler watersof Avalon Peninsula.   Sable Island, a sandspit 120 miles off Nova Scotia, is homemostly to seals and wild ponies. A permanent weather station thereremained staffed but no injuries or damages were reported despitehigh winds and heavy rains, forecasters said.   Hurricane forecasters said Dean's path also includes St. John's,Newfoundland's predominant city, but officials there hadn't issuedany special warnings.   ``We're telling people to keep listening to their radios,'' oneofficer said.   ``Coastal vessels would probably run for the nearest safe havenwhile ocean-going vessels would tend to track around the path ofthe hurricane,'' said Jim Cormier, a spokesman for the Search andRescue Centre in Halifax.   John Pearce, spokesman for the Canadian Hurricane Centre inHalifax, said Dean remained a full-fledged hurricane but wasexpected to quickly lose strength after hitting land this afternoonin Newfoundland.   At 6 a.m. EDT, the hurricane's center was 90 miles southwest ofSt. Pierre, said Miles Lawrence of the National Hurricane Center inCoral Gables, Fla. The center of the storm was near latitude 46.0north and longitude 58.0 west, or about 235 miles southwest of CapeRace, Newfoundland.   Lawrence said winds peaked at 89 mph over Sable Island, andremain about 80 mph around the hurricane's center. A hurricanerequires sustained winds over 74 mph.   Hurricane Dean was spawned in the Caribbean last week. Itchurned its way across Bermuda, leaving a trail of sunken boats androofless homes. Several people were slightly injured.   Most hurricanes approaching Canada have been downgraded beforethey hit land. The last storm to reach Canada at hurricane forcewas Hurricane Blanche in 1975, which clipped Nova Scotia but causedonly minor damage.</TEXT></DOC>
