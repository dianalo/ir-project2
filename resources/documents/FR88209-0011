These regulations allowthe establishment of definite viticultural areas. On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision ATF-60 (44 FR 56692)which added a new Part 9 to 27 CFR, providing for the listing of approvedAmerican viticultural areas, the names of which may be used as appellationsof origin. Section 4.25a(e)(1), Title 27, CFR, defines an American viticultural areaas a delimited grape-growing region distinguished by geographical features,the boundaries of which have been delineated in Subpart C of Part 9. Section 4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for proposing a viticulturalarea. Any interested person may petition ATF to establish a grape-growingregion as a viticultural area. The petition should include_(a) Evidence that the name of the proposed viticultural area is locallyand/or nationally known as referring to the area specified in the petition;(b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries of the viticulturalarea are as specified in the petition; (c) Evidence relating to the geographical characteristics (climate, soil,elevation, physical features, etc.) which distinguish the viticulturalfeatures of the proposed area from surrounding areas; (d) A description of the specific boundaries of the viticultural area,based on features which can be found on United States Geological Survey(U.S.G.S.) maps of the largest applicable scale; and (e) A copy of the appropriate U.S.G.S. maps with the boundaries prominentlymarked. <ITAG tagnum="84">Petition </ITAG>ATF received a petition for a viticultural area encompassing the westernhighlands area of Connecticut which borders on New York and Massachusetts.The viticultural area is known as Western Connecticut Highlands. The petitionwas submitted by Mr. andamp; Mrs. William Hopkins of Hopkins Vineyard, NewPreston, Connecticut. Within the Western Connecticut Highlands viticultural area there are fourwineries, with others being established. In addition, there are six grapegrowers. Overall the area covers approximately 1,570 square miles or 1,004,550acres.<ITAG tagnum="84">Evidence of Name </ITAG>The name Western Connecticut Highlands is descriptive of the rolling hillsand small mountains in the western part of Connecticut which are differentfrom the surrounding area in Connecticut, southwestern Massachusetts andsoutheastern New York state. The petitioner provided documentation from various sources to support onlythe name Western Highlands. The name Western Highlands has been used bythe Connecticut Agricultural Experimental Station, and the U.S. Soil ConservationService in the publication <T3>Soils of Connecticut, </T3>Bulletin andplusmin;787, Dec. 1980, by Hill,Sauter and Gonick, to describe the area. The name Western Highlands isalso commonly referred to on the General Soil Map of Connecticut. The petitioneralso included excerpts from the book <T3>Connecticut: A New Guide </T3>by William Bixby (Scribner's, 1974).The excerpts gave a description of the Western Highlands region as wellas other regions of Connecticut. The petitioner acknowledges that the area is locally called Western Highlands.However, the petitioner chose the viticultural area name Western ConnecticutHighlands because that name would distinguish the area from all other highlandareas in the United States. ATF has no objection to the viticultural areaname Western Connecticut Highlands since evidence of the name Western Highlandswas well documented in the petition and the further qualification ``Connecticut''accurately describes the geographic location of this grape-growing region.<ITAG tagnum="84">Evidence of Boundaries </ITAG>The boundaries of the viticultural area are based on distinguishing geographicfeatures as well as established and proposed grape-growing in the area.One U.S.G.S. map was submitted by the petitioner with the boundaries prominentlymarked on it. The basis for recognition of these boundaries is supportedby the unique name, geography and climate found only in this section ofConnecticut. <ITAG tagnum="84">Evidence of Geographic Features </ITAG>(a) Physical Features The State of Connecticut can be divided into four physiographic zones:(1) The Coastal Lowlands or Coastal Plain (Long Island Sound influence),(2) the Central Lowlands or Central Valley (Connecticut River influence),(3) the Western Highlands and (4) the Eastern Highlands. The Coastal Lowlands and Central Valley have elevations ranging from 0to less than 500 feet above sea level. The long broad Central Valley actuallybegins far to the north in New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts. The Western and Eastern Highlands are somewhat similar in climate and otherfeatures but are geographically separated by the Central Valley. Thereare some bonded wineries and grape growers in the Eastern Highlands. Thereare no bonded wineries located in the Central Valley. The Western Highlands are an extension of the Green Mountain and TaconicRanges to the north in Massachusetts with the general elevation in theviticultural area varying from 200 to 1,500 feet above sea level. The WesternHighlands are generally more rugged than the corresponding Eastern Highlandswhich have altitudes varying from 200 to 1,000 feet above sea level. (b) Precipitation Snowfall is heavier in the Western Connecticut Highlands than anywhereelse in the state, and ranges from 35 to 100 inches annually. Long-termrecords indicate that there is considerable variation in seasonal amountsof snowfall in the viticultural area; in one location more than 130 inchesfell in one year, during another year at the same location only 37 inchesfell. Snowfall varies throughout the State, lighter along the Coastal Lowlandsand heavier in the northwest portion of the viticultural area. The northwesternportion of the viticultural area receives about 100 inches of snow annually.At the Coastal Lowlands the average annual rainfall is lower than in theWestern Highlands. (c) Temperature The Eastern and Western Highlands have mean annual temperatures of 47 anddegrees;F.and 46 anddegrees;F., respectively. The mean annual temperature for the CoastalLowlands is 50 anddegrees;F. and the Central Valley is 49anddegrees;. Becauseof their relatively low elevation the Coastal Lowlands and Central Valleyhave warmer climates than the viticultural area. The climate of the CoastalLowlands and to some extent the climate of the Central Valley are alsogreatly influenced by the moderating effect of the Long Island Sound. The winters in Connecticut are not as long, or as severe, as they are inthe northern New England states. In the fall, freezing temperatures throughoutthe Connecticut regions usually begin about the middle of November, andend by the last week in March along the Coastal Lowlands and early in Aprilin the Western and Eastern Highlands. The area to the west of the viticultural area is the Hudson River Region,a complex distinct geological region characterized by the Hudson RiverValley and surrounding hills. This area has been a grape-growing regionfor over 300 years. In 1982, the Hudson River Region (encompassing approximately3,500 square miles) was established as an American viticultural area. Immediately north of the viticultural area is the Berkshire Mountain regionof Massachusetts and further north is the Green Mountain Range. The BerkshireMountain region is similar in broad physiography to the viticultural area.However, it is further north than the Western Connecticut Highlands andhas a slightly cooler climate. The elevation is higher in the Green MountainRange which is further into the northern interior, resulting in a morerugged terrain, colder average temperatures, and a shorter growing seasonthan the viticutural area and the Berkshire Mountain Range. (d) Soils and Geography The soils within the Western Connecticut Highlands viticultural area arepredominantly formed in glacial till derived from gneiss, schist and granite.The Hollis-Charlton, Paxton-Woodbridge, Charlton-Hollis, and Stockbridge-Farmington-Ameniasoils are the most commonly found soil series of the Western ConnecticutHighlands. The Eastern Highlands also have the same soils except that theStockbridge-Farmington-Amenia soils are only found in the Western ConnecticutHighlands. The north-south strip of lowland bisected by the Connecticut River comprisesthe Central Valley, which extends northerly from the Long Island Soundinto Massachusetts. Although broken with occasional traprock ridges, mostof the land is gently sloping with productive agricultural soils. The Central Valley is dominated by soils formed in glacial till derivedfrom sandstone, shale, conglomerate and basalt. The Wethersfield-Holyoke-Broadbrook, Penwood-Manchester, Windsor-Ninigret-Merrimac,Elmwood-Buxton-Scantic, and Hadley-Winooski soils are the most commonlyfound soil series of the Central Valley. These soil series are not foundin the Western or Eastern Highlands. Connecticut's southern boundary is formed by 253 miles of irregular shorelineon the Long Island Sound. Along this shore stretches a narrow strip offairly level land designated as the Coastal Lowlands. The coastline ischararacterized by alternating limited sections of sandy beach, rocky bluffs,and salt water marshes, indented with numerous small coves and inlets.This area is greatly influenced by the moderating temperatures of the LongIsland Sound. <ITAG tagnum="84">Notice of Proposed Rulemaking </ITAG>On August 11, 1987, Notice No. 635 was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>with a 45-day comment period. In that Notice,ATF invited comments from all interested parties regarding the proposalto establish ``Western Connecticut Highlands'' as an American viticulturalarea. No comments were received from the public during the comment period.<ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous </ITAG>ATF does not wish to give the impression by approving ``Western ConnecticutHighlands'' as a viticultural area that it is approving or endorsing thequality of the wine derived from this area. ATF is approving this areaas being distinct and not better than other areas. By approving this viticulturalarea, wine producers are allowed to claim a distinction on labels and advertisementsas to the origin of the grapes. Any commercial advantage gained can onlycome from consumer acceptance of wines from ``Western Connecticut Highlands.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act relating to a final regulatoryflexibility analysis (5 U.S.C. 604) are not applicable to this final rulebecause it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. The final rule will not impose, or otherwisecause, a significant increase in reporting, recordkeeping, or other complianceburdens on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, it is herebycertified under the provisions of section 3 of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 605 (b)) that this final rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>In compliance with Executive Order 12291, ATF has determined that thisfinal rule is not a ``major rule'' since it will not result in: (a) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(b) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(c) Significant adverse effects on competititon, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-511,44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, and its implementing regulations, 5 CFR Part 1320,do not apply to this final rule because no requirement to collect informationis imposed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal author of this document is Edward A.
