As proposed, the group, which includes top Parisian executives, would pay $30.65 a share, or about $230 million, for the Parisian shares it doesn't already own. The group had proposed in July to pay $33.65 a share, or $252 million.    Parisian shares had traded as high as $30.125 after the original proposal was made, but dropped as low as $14.25 after the October market crash. In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Parisian shares closed at $26, down $2.    The buy-out group, operating as P.I. Acquisition Corp., would pay less in exchange for eliminating certain &quot;material conditions&quot; Parisian was to satisfy prior to the completion of the merger, Parisian said. The company said in a statement that Hooker didn't believe that Parisian could satisfy the conditions.    A spokeswoman for Hooker, an Australian real estate developer, wouldn't say what conditions would be eliminated. Parisian executives weren't available for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
