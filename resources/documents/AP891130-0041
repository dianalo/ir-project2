It said three inflatables were launched from the Greenpeace shipGondwana stationed off South Georgia in the South Atlantic, wherethe group claims the Soviets are overfishing.   The group, in a statement, said the seven activists steered theinflatables on board the Soviet factory trawler Mikjail Verbitzkiyafter a wild ride.   It said the Soviet ship was attempting to put out nets whenGondwana approached and lowered the inflatable boats. Theinflatables reportedly stayed with the ship for three hours despite10-foot swells.   The statement said Greenpeace radioed the Soviet captain, inboth English and Russian, explaining the reasons for thenon-violent protest.   At one point, the inflatables actually landed on the stern ramp,blocking the trawling operation.   ``For the last 20 years the Antarctic ecosystem has beenplundered by indiscriminate fishing, especially by the Soviet Unionin the South Georgia area, and now these stocks are commerciallyextinct,'' said Greenpeace Antarctic Program Coodinator Maj dePoorter.   She said the whole ecological balance was at risk, as the fishare food for penguins, seabords, seals and whales.   Greenpeace, as part of its campaign to have Antarctica declareda world park, is demanding a moratorium on all fishing south of theAntarctic convergence until stocks have recovered.   ``The great whales that once populated this area are gone, nowthe fish are going,'' De Poorter said. ``Greenpeace will not simplystand by and watch.''</TEXT></DOC>
