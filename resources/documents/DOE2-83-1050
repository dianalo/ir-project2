<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-83-1050 </DOCNO><TEXT>Large phased-array radars can play a very important part in arms control.They can be used to determine the number of RVs being deployed, the typeof targeting of the RVs (the same or different targets), the shape ofthe deployed objects, and possibly the weight and yields of the deployedRVs. They can provide this information at night as well as during theday and during rain and cloud covered conditions. The radar can be onthe ground, on a ship, in an airplane, or space-borne. Airborne and space-borneradars can provide high resolution map images of the ground for reconnaissance,of anti-ballistic missile (ABM) ground radar installations, missile launchsites, and tactical targets such as trucks and tanks. The large groundbased radars can have microwave carrier frequencies or be at HF (highfrequency). For a ground-based HF radar the signal is reflected off theionosphere so as to provide over-the-horizon (OTH) viewing of targets.OTH radars can potentially be used to monitor stealth targets and missiletraffic.</TEXT></DOC>
