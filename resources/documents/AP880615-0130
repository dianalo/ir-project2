Michael Dukakisas they prepared to run against each other in November'spresidential election:</TEXT><HEAD>FRANCE</HEAD><TEXT>   _Le Monde of Paris (independent): ``The governor and the vicepresident, despite long public careers, remain largely unknown,vaguely perceived by public opinion. They have taken care not toshow their cards too soon, to make commitments on nothing or almostnothing. The technique has been shown shown to pay off for theprimaries, particularly for Mr. Dukakis, who did not have anyparticular advantage at the start over his Democratic competitors,while the vice president, loyal aide to Mr. Reagan, started severallengths in front in his race. ...   ``The qualities needed to succeed in this kind of contest arenot necessarily sufficient to make a good president, but it is truethat the system has worked, while many in the Democratic campfeared that it might get stuck.   ``Weren't they talking last autumn about the `Seven Dwarfs,'these seven Democratic candidates of whom none seemed to have themakings of a president, or even of a credible candidate? ...   ``Snow White has fallen in love with the smallest of the dwarfs,who has grown up a great deal in the meanwhile. To the point thathe his more than 10 points ahead of his Republican opponent in thepolls, and has increased his self-confidence while benefiting froma very favorable treatment from the media, especially television.''</TEXT><HEAD>CHILE</HEAD><TEXT>   _El Mercurio of Santiago (conservative): ``Dukakis has noexperience in interntional policy. Bush _ as the second man in thepresent administration _ is tied to the painful affair of the saleof arms to Iran and to an ineffective policy in Central America.Dukakis is prepared to suspend the aid to the Nicaraguananti-Sandinistas (which has already been done by Congress, againstReagan's will), and supports Costa Rican President Oscar Arias'peace plan for Central America, which has in effect meant leavingeverything unchanged, with the Sandinistas firmly in power''</TEXT><HEAD>JAPAN</HEAD><TEXT>   _Mainichi Daily News of Tokyo (conservative, English-language):``For Japan, which has close relations with the United States inthe political and economic phases, the `greatest vigilance' isrequired every four years.   ``During the first half of the primaries, Japan's political andeconomic circles exercised strong vigilance because of theappearance of the `Gephardt phenomenon' that included the spread ofa protectionist feeling in the grass roots and the trend toward`Japan bashing.' Fortunately, a wiser choice was later made by theAmericans and strong support was obtained by Bush and Dukakis whoare both anti-protectionist. ...   ``Hitherto, both Bush and Dukakis have given careful attentionto Japan. ...   ``From now on, it will be necessary for the two candidates todraw up their respective party platforms in advancing toward thepresidential election. It will be necessary to watch the definiteform that the policy toward Japan will take. ...   ``Since this is an election in another country, Japan can onlywatch and wait.''</TEXT><HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD><TEXT>   _The Times of London (independent): ``The Reagan presidency hasmeant stability for NATO. ...   ``Would a Dukakis presidency bring fundamental change? ...Unlike the current president, he says he would always consult hisallies before doing anything. ...   ``That is rather like preaching motherhood and apple pie. ...   ``He may discover ... if he becomes president that consensusamong the allies can be elusive. His commitment to consult theEuropeans will be popular in ... NATO capitals ... but a presidentwho is loath to act alone may then find it impossible to doanything. ...   ``But Europe too must adjust in time if Mr. Dukakis wins. ... Atpresent, he seems dedicated to retaining American troops in WesternEurope, but that commitment may be less firm when subjected topolitical pressures within America. ... The old issue ofburden-sharing is once more alive. ... Europeans should prepare tobe cooperative if they want to keep the alliance strong in whatcould be an era of change and readjustment. ...   ``The ... need to respond to new perceptions in America must beimpressed upon allied governments.''</TEXT><HEAD>CANADA</HEAD><TEXT>   _Maclean's (national weekly newsmagazine): ``If Dukakis ... winsthe November election, Canadians may have the most sympatheticincumbent in history in the White House. Dukakis has taken aleading role on issues high on Ottawa's agenda _ urging strictfederal emission controls to reduce acid rain and speaking out infavor of the Canadian-U.S. free trade agreement.''</TEXT><TEXT>   _Bill Fox, political columnist Toronto Star, on Jesse Jackson:``Jackson knows his dream of being the first black American electedto the highest office in the land will not be realized in 1988. ... But even as Dukakis moves inexorably towards the Democratic Partynomination, it is vital that Jackson keep running: vital to theDemocrats, even more vital to democracy in America.   ``Jackson strikes a responsive chord with the Vietnam veteranwithout work, the single mother in the inner city, people who sweaton the job. ... If Jackson's candidacy rekindles a commitment tothe democratic process by those who have questioned its worth oflate, then Jesse Jackson will be a winner, wherever he finishes inthe presidential race.''</TEXT></DOC>
