The bill mainly gives bank affiliates powers to sell and underwrite certain securities.    But the House Banking Committee seems to have something else in mind. Chairman Fernand St Germain not only is proposing less deregulation but seems intent on turning banks into quasi-welfare agencies.    For example, all federally insured depositories would be required to cash federal, state and local checks without charge to anyone with an identification card. The greater freedom to underwrite securities would be contingent on a passing grade in &quot;community reinvestment,&quot; meaning lending in rundown neighborhoods.    None of this is as expensive or dangerous as some of the welfare programs that banks have operated on their own for the benefit of Texas developers, Brazilian statists and the like. But if Congressmen succeed in engaging banks more deeply in social programs, bankers ultimately will argue that government and the taxpayers, not bankers themselves, should bear the costs of any unsound banking that results. With less justification, the savings and loan industry last year persuaded Congress to supplement industry deposit insurance premiums with government-backed borrowing.    Rep. St Germain may have more on his mind than mere populism. Securities firms and insurance agents do not welcome laws that let banks enter their fields. The competing forces reached a compromise on the Senate bill but that may have been only a prelude to a more vigorous fight in the House. Rep. St Germain's bill attaches so much excess baggage that even the American Bankers Association can't support it in its present form, according to ABA executive vice president Donald G. Ogilvie. It is not inconceivable that the real objective is a deadlock that would mean no bill at all.    Certainly that would be consistent with the past practice of Congress. Much of the substantial deregulation that has occurred in banking has happened without benefit of federal legislation. States have had the primary role in breaking down barriers to interstate banking and in permitting wider scope for bank holding companies. Non-bank banks -- set up just outside the official definition of what constitutes a bank -- were an artifact of regulatory permissiveness until the loophole was closed by federal law last summer.    The economically desirable goal of banking deregulation is to let banks adjust to a changing world in which securities, rather than loans, have become the preferred method of finance for the soundest borrowers. It is disturbing to see legislators adding social welfare baggage to an industry that is not in the best of shape when they could be reducing regulatory restrictions instead.    It may well be that the real problem in House Banking is a fear among members that further deregulation will weaken the power and influence of committee members themselves. It is a great comfort to politicians to have well-heeled PAC-men lined up at the office door asking favors. But it would be nice to think a thought or two is given once in a while to what constitutes good public policy. </TEXT></DOC>
