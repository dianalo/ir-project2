The chain will continue to carry an&quot;insignificant amount&quot; of LPs, Solomon said, if they have the space to stockthem.;    Rhino Records, a small record label and pair of retail stores inWest Los Angeles, launched an unsuccessful &quot;Save the LP&quot; campaign in 1987.;   But this year, for the first time, the label has no vinyl releases scheduled,and the stores will be forced to limit their stock of LPs, said HaroldBronson, Rhino's managing director.;    Profits no more;  &quot;The problem withLPs is that we really couldn't make any money selling them,&quot; Bronson said. &quot;Ifthe market remains the same, we will stay the same.&quot;;    &quot;Save the LP,&quot; then,might assume a new meaning for those skillful enough to predict which ones areworth saving.;    Depending on well-established criterion such as age, rarityand the artist involved, LPs are bound to increase in value -- if onlysentimental -- over time.;    The LP, which made its debut in the UnitedStates in 1948, has been a popular collectors item among music buffs since thelate '50s, Hansen of KLSX said.;    But never have LPs been collected becausethey were no longer manufactured. And that could influence their value inyears to come, say industry sources.;    &quot;If we look at history, the last rock'n' roll 78s which were made in the late '50s are now quite valuable, some(worth) as much as a few hundred dollars,&quot; said Hansen, who said his vinylrecord collection includes &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; of discs.;    Don't expectto make a fortune overnight, however, on a few old popular Rolling Stonesalbums. It is likely that years, perhaps decades, will pass before many LPsbegin to fetch the prices of some of today's valuable 78s.;    For one thing,LPs have far outnumbered 78s in their life span -- both in variety andquantity. So, rare LPs should be more difficult to find.;    Moreover, sincemost music originally recorded on vinyl will continue to be available on CD,demand for LPs for musical reasons will not be as great.;    Value takes time; And collectible records generally take time to increase in value, Hansensaid.;    &quot;Not many people cared about the last 78s when they were put out,&quot;Hansen said. &quot;And today there are so many more record collectors out there.;   &quot;It certainly will add to the collectibility of records, but I don't know ifit's going to make every vinyl record ever made a collectible. Many 78s thatwere hit songs are worth $200 right now. But others are worth 50 cents.&quot;;   Hansen said that recordings by today's most popular artists (M.C. Hammer, forexample) that are still released on vinyl should increase in value sooner thanothers.;    For some audiophiles, the LP is valuable regardless of its rarityor condition, and it remains their element of choice over CDs -- despite ageneral consensus by the public that the CD is technologically far superior,more convenient and more durable than the LP.;    James Boyk, a West LosAngeles concert pianist and a music and science instructor at CaliforniaInstitute of Technology in Pasadena, said a growing number ofrecording-industry sources are having reservations about -- and striving toimprove -- the recording technology used in compact discs.;    &quot;I would bevery surprised if, in two or three years, we do not have a new CD format thatcannot be played on CD equipment today,&quot; Boyk said. &quot;Many people feel that thesound is just not there yet.&quot;;    But that isn't likely to bring back the LP.;   Music retailers love CDs because they take up less shelf space than LPs.And they continue to sell like compact hot cakes.;    According to theRecording Industry Association of America in Washington, D.C., less than 4percent of pre-recorded music was on vinyl in 1989 (1990 figures are not yetavailable). Many retailers and manufacturers estimate it's about 1 percenttoday.;    In 1989, CDs accounted for $2.6 billion (207 million units) insales nationally compared to $220 million (34.6 million) by the LP.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  VINCE KOWALICK, Los Angeles Daily News  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Los Angeles  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910127  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  14  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,035  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday January 27, 199100027102,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
