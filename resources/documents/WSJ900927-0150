But surgeons arepioneering techniques to get patients back to work sooner.   Carpal tunnel syndrome, a weakness and pain in the wristoften linked to repetitive motion, has become one of the mostcommonly recognized injuries of the workplace. And theoperation, a last recourse following the failure of othertherapy, has become an important part of the surgicalrepertoire, though estimates of the number of operationsperformed in the U.S. range widely. Some surgeons place theannual number between 50,000 and 100,000.</LP><TEXT>   Although the new techniques, which use fiberoptics andvideo cameras, still provoke skepticism within the surgicalprofession, they are sure to attract keen attention frompatients and their employers.   At a surgeons' conference this week in Toronto, John M.Agee presented the results of a carefully controlled study ofthe new approach. Ninety-seven patients needing surgery onone wrist were randomly assigned to surgeons using new ortraditional techniques at 10 medical centers. The result:After the traditional surgery, the median return-to-work timewas 46.5 days; after the new way, only 25 days.   For the group that underwent the new surgery, gripping andpinching strength returned sooner. And according to patients'subjective reports, pain and tenderness due to surgery easedfaster with the new approach.   &quot;The issue for society and for my patients is: When canthey go back to work and feed the family?&quot; says Dr. Agee ofSacramento, Calif., who has been in the forefront of testingthe high-tech methods.   The issue isn't always that stark, because many people arecushioned by workman's compensation or sick-time arrangementswith their employers. But there are other concerns, too, suchas how soon people can use their hands for such simplefunctions as dressing and driving.   Dr. Agee's report follows one earlier this year by JamesC.Y. Chow, who has been developing his own new techniqueusing somewhat different methods. Dr. Chow, a professor atSouthern Illinois University School of Medicine inSpringfield, says that in his first 149 cases, 29% of thepatients returned to work within a week and 59% within twoweeks.   Already manufacturers are teaming up with the doctors.Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing Co. has sold about 100equipment packages derived from the work of a Californiaresearch laboratory directed by Dr. Agee. Smith andamp; NephewDyonics Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of Smith andamp; Nephew PLC,London, plans to market a package based on Dr. Chow's workearly next year.   Yet many doctors caution that questions of effectiveness,cost and safety remain. &quot;As to whether it's a major advance,the jury is still out,&quot; says Ronald L. Linscheid, presidentof the American Society for Surgery of the Hand.   Recently, carpal tunnel syndrome has received intensescrutiny as a work-related ailment, though it can also resultfrom pregnancy and diseases including arthritis. It is oftenassociated with jobs requiring repetitive motion, whetheralong an assembly line or at a computer terminal.   In August, the Labor Department's Occupational Safety andHealth Administration issued guidelines to the meat-packingindustry meant to prevent such injuries, the first step in aprogram OSHA plans to extend to other industries.   The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which extrapolates theincidence of work-related injuries from employers' reports,recorded 115,000 repetitive motion, or &quot;repeated trauma,&quot;injuries for 1988. That was 48% of all recorded injuries, aproportion that had grown steadily through the decade from18% in 1981.   The number of people who suffer from carpal tunnelsyndrome remains a mystery because the repeated traumacategory includes other injuries, such as noise-causeddeafness. But no one doubts that awareness of the syndrome,which can lead people to seek medical treatment more quickly,is rising.   &quot;It's just exploding,&quot; says Roger Stephens, an OSHAspecialist in ergonomics, or the science of adapting theworkplace to the worker.   The carpal tunnel is a tiny channel within the wristthrough which tendons and a nerve, called the median nerve,pass into the hand. If membranes around the tendons thicken,pressure can build on the nerve and its blood supply, causingpain and numbness and loss of strength in the hand. Thesesymptoms can often be allayed by stopping the activity thataggravates them, by splinting the wrist or by takinganti-inflammatory drugs.   Still, a lot of people turn to surgery. The framework ofthe carpal tunnel, though mostly bone, includes a section ofligament. Severing it relieves the pressure.   Traditionally, surgeons have made an incision across thewrist and up the hand, one inch to three inches in length.That exposes the ligament to plain view. By contrast, Drs.Agee and Chow first insert into the wrist a tube known as anendoscope, fitted with a lens and fiberoptic apparatus, andthen their cutting instruments. They find the ligament andwatch the movement of the instruments on a TV monitor. Dr.Agee uses one small incision; Dr. Chow, two. In bothapproaches the goal is to minimize damage to other tissues.   Still, surgeons may hesitate to switch from thetraditional technique. Some want more evidence that the rateof recurring symptoms isn't unusually high. Another issue iscost, though surgeons and hospitals shouldn't have to raisetheir bills sharply just to cover equipment purchases. 3M isselling its package for $6,000, and only the blade, a $160item, is disposable.   The most sensitive issue may be the risk of using anendoscope. Dr. Agee himself emphasizes the need for trainingto prevent nicking of nerves and arteries, though he notesthat even the traditional technique hasn't been free ofaccidents. A spokeswoman says 3M won't sell its equipment todoctors unless they take a half-day course, including work oncadavers.   A. Lee Osterman, a hand surgeon at the University ofPennsylvania, has tried both the Agee and Chow techiques. Fornow, he is withholding judgment. But he says of the new way,&quot;I think patients are going to push us to use it, as long asit isn't unacceptably dangerous.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
