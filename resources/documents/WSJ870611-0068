And the potential outcome -- a crippling strike -- has the entertainment industry bracing for the worst.    At issue is a demand by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers for a rollback in the residuals that the directors are paid for repeat use of their work. A movie shown first in theaters generates residuals when it is released on videocassette or appears on television, for example.    Such ancillary markets have become increasingly important to Hollywood. Already, only a fraction of feature films make a profit from showings in movie theaters. Steven Rosenberg, an analyst with the media-research firm Paul Kagan andamp; Associates, notes that last year's movie-industry videocassette revenue of $2.16 billion far exceeded the $1.67 billion brought in by theatrical distribution.    The Alliance, which is dominated by the major studios, wants to establish the principle that residuals needn't be paid until a production shows a profit. Under the current system, contends Nicholas Counter, president of the Alliance, &quot;you're paying out additional compensation even before you've recouped your costs.&quot;    Indeed, those costs are what members of the Alliance cite as their motive. Although the major studios' revenue from movies alone was about $7.2 billion last year, up from $3.5 billion in 1981, the studios contend that these figures mask skyrocketing outlays for production and marketing.    &quot;It is time for us to really take stock and redefine the economics of the business,&quot; says one studio executive who asked not to be named.    But the 8,500 members of the Directors Guild of America, who together earned $50 million in residuals last year, counter that those fees are a fundamental part of their minimum compensation, without which they couldn't survive. They point out that only a few of its members are big-name -- and thus high-paid -- directors.    &quot;I drive a Honda,&quot; says Paul Stanley, a veteran director and Guild activist whose credits include episodes of &quot;Lou Grant&quot; and &quot;Hawaii Five-0.&quot; &quot;I live in a tract house in Tarzana. My neighbors are 30 feet away from me on both sides.&quot;    The directors, who work mostly on a free-lance basis, also argue that under the proposed system producers who chose to conceal profits could thus avoid paying residuals altogether.    Despite the Guild's traditionally pacific stance (it has never had a strike since it was founded in 1936), chances of a walkout are better than even, according to studio and union executives. While the producers have tried before to slash residuals, they claim to be determined this year. And the directors appear equally adamant about not going along.    &quot;If these guys are serious about rolling back residuals and supplemental payments, then there will be a strike,&quot; vows Gilbert Cates, the president of the Guild, who says a strike vote will take place if and when the producers' final offer is turned down. Negotiations between the two groups started last month, and tense sessions are now being held daily. In the meantime, the directors have had picket signs printed.    Should a strike occur, the result would be &quot;basically a shutdown,&quot; says another prominent studio executive. Against that possibility, studios are rushing to finish movies in the works, and many television production companies canceled their customary April and May production breaks, opting instead to work right through the spring to stockpile episodes.    At the Lorimar Television unit of Lorimar-Telepictures Corp., for instance, last season's filming of &quot;Knots Landing&quot; concluded on a Friday in April and shooting for the fall season -- which normally wouldn't have started until June or July -- began the following Monday.    Despite the accelerated production, television viewers can expect more reruns if a strike occurs, but the effect will vary according to the type of programming: Soap operas, for example, would likely be curtailed sooner than such shows as daily newscasts, which can more easily proceed -- although with problems -- absent a Guild director.    A walkout would take longer to affect movies. According to the trade publication Daily Variety, 233 feature films began shooting in the first five months of 1987, up from 159 a year ago. Still, a long strike could mean a scarcity of major new films by early 1989.    The talks are being closely watched by other entertainment-industry unions. Although their contracts forbid sympathy strikes, they know that such major negotiations are usually precedent-setting. And writers and actors have fought for years to maintain residuals -- as well as to extend them whenever a new technology comes along.    &quot;In our 54 years, we've had six strikes,&quot; says Mark Locher, a spokesman for the Screen Actors Guild. &quot;All of them were over residuals.&quot;    Fears are such that even agents and business managers are making preparations in case of a walkout by directors. &quot;Everybody in the business is sitting on pins and needles,&quot; says Peter Dekom, a local entertainment lawyer. &quot;Business-management firms are setting aside strike funds for their own survival.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
