Regulations (50 CFR 16.13) governing the importationof fish, or the eggs of fish, or the flesh of fish of the family Salmonidaewere developed and implemented to reduce the risk of introducing certainuntreatable, uncontrollable pathogens of salmonid fishes into the UnitedStates. These regulations have not been revised for nearly 20 years. Factorsaffecting the effectiveness, and the effect, of these regulations, havechanged considerably during that time. The Fish and Wildlife Service needsinformation, comments, and suggestions from all interested parties concerningthe value of such regulations; the economic, environmental, and other effectsof the existing and potential regulations; and suggestions for specificprovisions that should be included in the regulations. The informationobtained from public comments will be used to develop proposed regulationsand to complete necessary environmental and regulatory analyses. The materialthat follows: (1) Requests information and comments on specific issuesrelevant to existing or potential regulations, (2) provides additionalbackground information on the rationale for the regulations, and (3) describesthe process that will be used to develop the revised regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>Disease in fish populations results from interactions of fish, pathogens,and the environment. The simultaneous presence of a suitable host fishand a pathogen in a particular place may not lead to disease; however,the most certain way to avoid disease is to keep host fish and pathogensseparate. Minimizing the risk of disease in hatchery reared fish used tomaintain stocks that cannot be maintained through natural reproductionis especially important. Many populations of trout and salmon are maintainedprimarily through hatchery production; therefore, regulations have focusedon the importation of salmonid fishes and the flesh or eggs of salmonidfishes, so as to reduce the risk of introducing untreatable, uncontrollablepathogens into the hatchery and free-ranging stocks of salmonid fishesin the United States. Present regulations require that importations of live fish or dead fish(including frozen fish or fillets) or eggs of the fish family Salmonidaemust be <ITAG tagnum="21">By direct shipment, accompanied by a certification that the importationis free of the protozoan <T3>Myxosoma cerebralis,</T3> the causative agent of so-called whirlingdisease, and the virus causing viral hemorrhagic septicemia, or Egtveddisease. The certification shall be signed in the country of origin bya designated official acceptable to the Secretary of the Interior as beingqualified in fish pathology, or in the United States by a qualified fishpathologist designated for this purpose by the Secretary of the Interior.</ITAG>Fish caught in the wild in North America, or fish fleet or eggs that havebeen processed in a manner that kills the pathogens have been exemptedfrom these regulations. The existing regulations were not designed to dealwith pathogens that are already widespread in the United States, can becontrolled by standard therapeutic measures, or do not cause disease insalmonid fishes. Existing regulations and procedures would be retainedin the revised regulations except for provisions that are identified tobe in need of addition, deletion, or modification. <ITAG tagnum="84">Specific Information Needs </ITAG>Interested parties are encouraged to offer comments and suggestions onany or all aspects of 50 CFR 16.13 of concern to them. However, the Fishand Wildlife Service is particularly interested in economic, environmental,and general information relating to the following specific questions and/ortopics. A background statement providing basic information follows eachquestion. 1. Should a provision be included that would require all importations ofsalmonid fishes or eggs to be certified as free of all known replicatingviral pathogens of salmonid fishes. (Viruses not known to cause pathologicaleffects in fish or that cannot replicate on salmonid fish cell cultureswould not be included.) What would be the effects of adding this requirement?<T3>Background:</T3> Diseases of fish caused by viruses cannot be treatedeffectively through existing methods. At the time the present regulationswere written, viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) was the only known viraldisease considered a serious threat to fish resources in the United States.The list of viruses known to infect fish has grown substantially in recentyears and continues to grow rapidly, thereby making it virtually impossileto maintain an up-to-date current list of controlled pathogens. A generalban on viruses known to replicate/cause cytopathic effects on culturesof fish cells has been suggested as an effective, practical method of preventingthe importation of those viruses identified since the original regulationswere established, as well as those that may be identified in the future.2. Should a provision be included to require all importations of fish oreggs of esocid fishes to be certified as free of all replicating viralpathogens of salmonid or esocid fishes? What would be the effects of suchan addition?<T3>Background:</T3> Esocid fishes are known to contract and carry VHS;therefore, importation of these fishes could be a possible avenue for introductionof VHS, or possibly other viral pathogens, into U.S. waters.3. Should a provision be included banning the importation of live fishesof the families Salmonidae and Esocidae? What would be the effects of sucha provision?<T3>Background:</T3> Importations of live fish create the greatest riskfor introducing pathogens into the United States. There are no known proceduresfor effectively disinfecting live fish prior to shipment, and they normallywill be transferred into fish culture facilities or lakes and streams wherethey and any pathogens they carry will mingle with resident stocks.4. Should a provision be included to require all live eggs of salmonidand esocid fishes to be water-hardened in solutions of polyvinylpyrrolidoneiodine prior to importation into the United States? What would be the effectsof such a provision?<T3>Background:</T3> Water-hardening and/or treatments before and/or aftershipment of eggs have been shown to remove pathogens from the surface ofeggs and thereby to reduce the risk of transferring pathogens.5. Should parental stocks from which live salmonid or esocid eggs are obtainedfor importation into the United States be required to have a two-year historyof freedom (three inspections over a two-year period) from the viral pathogensbanned under these regulations? What would be the effects of such a regulation?<T3>Background:</T3> Sampling and monitoring over an extended period oftime would reduce the risk of a pathogen actually being present, but notbeing detected during a single inspection.6. Should fillets, fresh or frozen, of salmonid or esocid fishes to beexcluded from the provisions of these regulations? What would be the effectof such an exemption?<T3>Background:</T3> It has been suggested that there is very little probabilityof fillets being discarded uncooked, or otherwise unprocessed, and, therefore,they pose very little risk for introducing pathogens into North Americanwaters.7. Should fish caught in North American waters from free-ranging stocksbe subject to the same certification requirements that apply to fish, fisheggs, or fish products imported from other continents or produced in NorthAmerican aquaculture facilities? What would be the effects of such a provision?<T3>Background:</T3> Present regulations exempt from certification requirementsthose fish caught under a valid sport or commercial license and landedin North America, because such fish and the waters they inhabit may movefreely across national boundaries and it is not practical to enforce sucha regulation. However, certification of freedom from viral hemorrhagicsepticemia virus and <T3>Myxobolus cerebralis</T3> is required for fish from all aquaculturefacilities, including those in North America, because these fish are thoughtto have greater probability of carrying controlled pathogens and it ispossible to operate a valid inspection and certification program. It hasbeen suggested that free-ranging fish and cultured fish should be treatedsimilarly, where practical to do so.8. Should a provision be included requiring live eggs of the Atlantic salmon(<T3>Salmo salar</T3>) to be certified as free of <T3>Renibacterium salmoninarum</T3>, the causative agent for bacterialkidney disease? What would be the effects of such a requirement?<T3>Background:</T3> <T3>Reinibacterium salmoninarum</T3> is common in many areas of the UnitedStates; however, there have been no outbreaks of bacterial kidney diseasein the hatcheries and stocks that provide fish for the programs designedto restore natural runs of Atlantic salmon in New England, nor has thisbacterium been found in sea-run adults returning to rivers in New England.There is concern that failure to require imported Atlantic salmon eggsto be free of <T3>Reinibacterium salmoninarum</T3> could increase the reservoir of infectiveagents, thereby increasing the probability that returning adults wouldcarry the pathogen and, in turn, lead to disease outbreaks that would jeopardizerestoration efforts. <T3>Reinibacterium salmoninarum</T3> is egg-transmissible; therefore, itcan be argued that imported eggs must be certified to come from stocksfree of the bacterium if the risk from such introductions is to be avoided.9. Should the present requirement that importations of salmonid fishesor eggs be certified as free of <T3>Myxobolus (myxosoma) cerebralis</T3> be deleted? What would be theeffects of deleting this requirement?<T3>Background:</T3> Whirling disease, caused by <T3>Myxobolus cerebralis,</T3> is untreatable. At the time the presentregulations were written, the impact of the disease was considered to bevery severe. Present information indicates that <T3>Myxobolus cerebralis</T3> has become firmly established in some areas(at least 16 States of the United States) and management techniques havebeen developed that reduce the undesirable effects of the pathogen.10. Should a provision be included that would require laboratories thatwish to import tissues, suspensions, fluids, cell cultures, or other materialscontaining pathogens covered by these regulations (50 CFR 16.13) to demonstrateadequate operational and containment procedures and facilities prior tobeing approved to receive such imports? What would be the effects of sucha provision.<T3>Background: </T3>Professional laboratories generally have facilitiesfor preventing the accidental discharge of pathogens and standard operationalprocedures (e.g. no studies on live fish and sterilization of all wastematerial) that minimize the possibility of pathogen escapement. Nevertheless,there is concern that standards and periodic inspections of such laboratorieswould reduce the risk of accidental release of controlled pathogens.11. Should a provision be included allowing the Director of the UnitedStates Fish and Wildlife Service to approve certain laboratories with establishedhistories of competence and performance in fish pathology as CertifyingLaboratories designated to certify the pathogen status of fish to be importedinto the United States?<T3>Background: </T3>Present regulations provide for designation of individualsonly as Certifying Officials. It has been suggested that there should beprovisions to exempt professional fish pathologists working in well-establishedlaboratories from the need to apply individually for approval as a CertifyingOfficial.12. Should a provision be included prohibiting individuals from certifyingthe pathogen status of shipments in which the Certifying Official may havea vested interest? What would be the effects of such a provision?<T3>Background: </T3>It has been argued that a conflict of interest existsif the result of a fish health inspection could cause in financial gainor loss or the possibility of such for the Certifying Official (inspector),or if the inspector has a financial or other interest in the fish beinginspected. It is standard professional procedure and practice in otherestablished inspection programs (e.g. USDA) to prohibit such conflictsof interest, or even the appearance of such conflicts.<ITAG tagnum="84">Process for Developing Revised Regulations</ITAG>This notice informs all interested parties that the Fish and Wildlife Serviceintends to revise the regulations pertaining to the importation of salmonidfishes and other fishes that may carry pathogens of salmonid fishes. Informationhas been requested concerning specific issues, a request made for additionalsuggestions, and opportunity provided for comment on the effects of possiblemodifications to the existing regulations. A schedule for public commenthas been established.Interested parties are invited to submit written comments to the Divisionof Fish Hatcheries. Comments may address any aspect of the existing regulations,possible revisions, and their present or potential impacts. No specificformat is required. Details concerning the economic and environmental effectsof possible revisions or suggested wording for the revised regulationswill be especially useful. If sufficient interest and concern are expressed,the Fish and Wildlife Service will schedule public meetings at key locationsto provide additional opportunities for comments.After the conclusion of the comment period for this notice of intent, proposedregulations will be developed by the Fish and Wildlife Service and announcedin the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> Public comment will be invited on the proposedregulations and, if necessary, public meetings scheduled. Final regulationsreflecting all public comments, and the stewardship responsibilities ofthe Fish and Wildlife Service will be prepared and published subsequentlyin the <T4>Federal Register.</T4><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 16.</ITAG>Animal diseases, Fish, Freight, Imports, Transportation, Wildlife.<ITAG tagnum="71">Dated: August 8, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard M.
