(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Presidential Airways Inc., which operatesas a feeder service for United Airlines at its Washington DullesInternational Airport hub, has filed for protection from creditorsunder Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code.   Presidential, which operates as United Express, remainedoperating Thursday, company President Harold J. ``Hap'' Pareti said.   However, flights will be dropped in eight of the 24 cities the4-year-old carrier served: the West Virginia cities of Elkins,Morgantown and Clarksburg; Hot Springs, Va., where service would besuspended normally Tuesday; Columbia, S.C.; Daytona Beach andMelbourne, Fla.; and Salisbury, Md.   United Airlines spokeswoman Sara Dornacker in Chicago saidUnited is ``cooperating fully'' with Presidential and helping itmake alternate travel arrangements for passengers who may beaffected by the service suspensions.   ``We made these cuts really to maintain the bulk of our revenuesand at the same time to size down the system, so what we're flyinggenerates the maximum amount of cash at the lowest cost level,''Pareti said.   As of today, Presidential expects to operate 64 daily flights,compared with 75 Wednesday, Pareti said.   The bankruptcy filing, made in U.S. Bankruptcy Court inAlexandria, ``gives us the opportunity to continue therestructuring of our company which began months ago,'' he said.   Steve Dewey, chairman of the pilots union at Presidential, saidpilots signed a labor contract making wage concessions two weeksago.   ``The company has been very candid with us, and we were awarethat the airline has had financial difficulties,'' he said in astatement. ``We did our part to help this company. We are very muchdisappointed.''   The move follows Chapter 11 filings by two other airlines thisyear: strikebound Eastern Airlines in early March and Braniff Inc.in late September, its second such filing in seven years.   According to court documents, Presidential had $30 million inassets and $76 million in liabilities as of June 30. The largestcreditor, aircraft maker British Aerospace PLC, is owed about $26million for aircraft, the court papers said.   Debts during the first two years of operation totaled $70million, Pareti said.   ``We're now at a point where we need to pay back theseobligations,'' he said. ``We were not generating enough cash flowto run the daily operation and pay the past debt.   Last month, three vice presidents were dismissed and pay cutswere imposed on 709 workers. The full-time payroll was reduced byabout 90 workers, mainly through attrition, Pareti said.   Presidential hired an investment banking firm in September todevise a plan to help the airline restructure its debt and find newsources of capital.   Presidential began four years ago as a mid-sized carrier,switched to a charter service and then to a feeder service forContinental Airlines, which at the time maintained a hub at Dulles.However, Houston-based Continental gradually consolidated many ofits flights in Newark, N.J., and closed its Washington hub.   In January 1988 Presidential became a feeder for United, a movethat has provided some economic security.</TEXT></DOC>
