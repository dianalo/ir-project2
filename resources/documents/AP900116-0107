Rudy Boschwitz clambered up the creakingstairs he last walked down as a toddler when his family fled theNazis 56 years ago.   Revisiting the Berlin house in which his parents lived until hewas nearly 3, Boschwitz recalled the day of Jan. 30, 1933.   ``The same day, my father came home and told my mother we wouldleave,'' the Minnesota Republican said Tuesday. ``And we wentwithin six months.''   Boschwitz said the trigger for returning to his birthplace wasthe opening of the Berlin Wall.   ``I've never been back,'' he said. ``With the reunification, formany practical purposes, of the city and maybe because I'm gettinga little older, I had a yen to take a look at my roots.''   He and his parents, both Polish-born Jews, fled Berlin forCzechoslovakia in the summer of 1933 and ended up in New York,where Boschwitz spent the first three decades of his life.   While Boschwitz, 59, tried to piece together memories from hisBerlin days, the past was vivid for Frank Schiff, a childhoodfriend who lived in the same house and whom Boschwitz met again bychance years later.   ``It looks very familiar,'' Schiff said, once inside the1915-vintage art deco apartment building.   The house, on busy Hohenzollerndamm avenue, is in what is now aWest Berlin residential area that emerged relatively unscathed fromfierce fighting at the end of World War II.   ``It was very pleasant here before the Hitler period,'' saidSchiff, a 68-year-old retired economist from Alexandria, Va. AGerman Jew, he too was uprooted and fled with his family to theUnited States in 1936.   Boschwitz returned on a rainy day to a city that was extensivelyrebuilt after the war. ``It's a nice place,'' was his firstimpression.   West German businessman Eberhard Naundorf and his wife,Christine, said they were glad to welcome Boschwitz back into theapartment they now rent.   ``The war has created so many people who try to find theirroots,'' said Mrs. Naundorf, herself of Polish-German descent.   On a four-day trip to Germany, Boschwitz visited the Berlin Wallafter arriving Monday. He chipped out a few pieces.   East Germany opened the wall along with its other westernborders on Nov. 9, under massive pressure from street demonstratorsand an exodus of tens of thousands of its citizens.   In a sign of the changing times, Boschwitz was due to meet EastGerman Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer and opposition groups, andtour East Berlin. He also will meet with Minnesota soldiersstationed in West Berlin.</TEXT></DOC>
