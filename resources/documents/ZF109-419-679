(services).andO;Topic:     AutomobilesPriceReliabilityConsumer BehaviorInformation servicesOn-LineConsumer Reports (Periodical).andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>You'd never walk into a boardroom unprepared for serious negotiations.andP;  Butyou've probably walked into a car dealership and worked out a sales agreementknowing little more than that you liked the curve of the car's fenders andthe feel from behind the wheel.andM;Never again.andP;  The same tool that you use to prepare for high-powered businessdeals--the PC--can help you negotiate the best price on your next car.andM;Start by finding out as much as you can about the car--standard equipment,options, dealer price and suggested retail price.andP;  With a modem and asubscription to CompuServe, you can get the complete lowdown on any car modelthrough Online Consumer Reports (type GO CRAUTO).andM;The service reviews most car models, bringing up a six-page, full-text reporton the car of your choice.andP;  The report, extracted from the Consumers Union'smost recent Summary Judgment of Cars, rates the car's reliability, frequencyof repair and trouble spots.andP;  This information is available from ConsumerReports magazine's annual buyers' guide, but downloading the reports ($1 plusa 20-cent-per-minute connect charge) will cost less than spending $6.95 onits paperback counterpart.andM;Once you get the facts on the car you want, try the price quote serviceAutoquot-R (type GO AUTOQUOT).andP;  Its detailed price quotes can be orderedonline and delivered in 24 hours via CompuServe Mail or sent the next daythrough U.S.andP;  Mail.andM;The price quote reveals the overall suggested retail price and dealer's cost.andO;It specifies standard equipment (so you won't be fooled into paying extra forpart of the base model), and it lists the suggested retail price and dealercost of every available option.andM;You'll also receive a booklet with tips and strategies for getting a gooddeal.andP;  For instance, buy toward the end of the month, when dealers,struggling to meet quotas, are likely to be more willing to negotiate.andM;The quote and guide cost $14, a little more than the 900-number phoneservices that quote dealer and suggested retail prices.andP;  But with the 900numbers, you often end up paying for a recording that tells you to call backlater because all operators are busy.andP;  Autoquot-R's reports are far moredetailed, and you can access them at any time.andM;Armed with the background information, you're ready to sit across the tablefrom any car salesperson and negotiate a favorable deal.andP;  Here again, the PCcan be a great tool.andP;  Take along a laptop to run quick calculations or, moreimportantly, as an intimidating prop.andM;A great car salesperson is also a great actor who'll wince at the dollarfigure you propose and say, &quot;I don't think my manager will go for it, butyou're a nice person and I'll go to bat for you.&quot; Then he walks into themanager's office, and the two of them talk animatedly about last night'sballgame.andP;  After about five minutes, he comes back shaking his head andcounters your offer: &quot;It's a tough deal, but my manager will go for it if youcan give up the air conditioning.&quot;andM;With a laptop, you too can be a convincing actor.andP;  Car dealerships aredecidedly low-tech places, and the sight of a computer lets the sales staffknow they've no longer got the advantage.andP;  So, when the salesperson starts towhine about having kids to feed and quotas to make, just pull the laptop outof your briefcase and crank it up.andM;Run a few numbers through a financial calculator program such as PercentEdge,from the Timeslips Corporation (for information, see page 207 of August'sPersonal Finance section), and say, &quot;Yep, I've got kids, too, and I thinkyou're going to have to come down another $500.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
