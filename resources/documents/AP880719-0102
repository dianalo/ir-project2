I'm not sure how well it will playeverywhere else. I don't think nastiness ever plays very well,''said Bush's press secretary, Sheila Tate.   Bush, fishing in Wyoming with Treasury Secretary James A. BakerIII, had no plans to watch or listen to the Democratic NationalConvention, and thus likely missed Monday night's keynote address,Ms. Tate said.   In that speech, Ms. Richards, who is Texas' state treasurer,brought roars of delight from Democrats with her ``silver foot''line.   ``I do think it played well to that liberal convention crowd.But I thought it was thin on substance, thinner on facts and Ithought it was thinnest on any vision,'' Ms. Tate said.   ``It seems to me that people are more interested in leadershipthan in laugh lines,'' she added.   The spokeswoman said that, while Bush likely didn't hear any ofthe speech, ``I'm sure we'll tell him about it.''   ``He wanted to stare at a fish eye, not the CBS eye or the NBCpeacock,'' Ms. Tate said.</TEXT></DOC>
