(1) Reduction of runningcost because the gas of their own manufacture can be used as a fuel.(2) Contracted electricity need not be increased because no electricpower is used. This report describes a city gas dehumidifying unit bythe use of a gas engine which is the first case in Japan. This systemadopted an indirect chilling method. It is necessary to select a typeof fuel for the gas engine in the chilling unit. Shiogama Gas Co. useda 5 C gas (4500 kcal/Nm{sup 3}) which contains more hydrogen. Operationis smooth (since Oct, 1985) causing neither back-fire nor knocking. Thesystem is compact and safe. Quantity of the gas supplied is 3.0 - 6.5kg/cm{sup 2}. (4 figs, 5 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
