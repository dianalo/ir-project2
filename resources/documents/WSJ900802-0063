As part of a $283 billion authorization bill for thePentagon, the committee voted to block Defense Secretary DickCheney from closing any more domestic bases until at leastJan. 1, 1992. But at the same time, the panel ordered thePentagon to provide Congress with a detailed plan examiningwhether most of the 336,000 troops currently based in Europecan't be brought back to the U.S. by 1994.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved an$8 billion military construction bill that also shifts fundstoward U.S. bases and away from bases overseas. The spendingbill would cut more than $1.15 billion from the Pentagon'sfiscal 1991 budget and reduce U.S. contribution to NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization infrastructure accounts by 50%.   The Senate money bill wouldn't provide any funds forconstruction in Japan or Korea, and cuts back sharply onPentagon requests for facilities in Europe.   The appropriations measure represents a further $331million cut beyond the House-passed version of the same bill.While leaving some leeway for the Bush administration, thecommittee joined the House in freezing any further U.S.contributions for construction of a major NATO air base atCrotone, Italy.   The Armed Services Committee's authorization bill alsowould cancel construction of the base. Authorization billsset policy legislatively and provide a ceiling on the moneyspent for programs. Appropriations bills represent the actualmoney and allow committees to influence policy by their powerover the purse.   The House committee's action doesn't affect plans to shutdown more than 80 domestic military bases picked for closureby a blue-ribbon commission and ratified by Congress lastyear. The panel, however, voted to reduce Secretary Cheney'sauthority and flexibility to propose a &quot;hit list&quot; ofadditional bases.   Intent on concentrating on cutbacks outside the U.S., thecommittee voted to require the Pentagon -- for the first timesince the end of World War II -- to draft plans for dualbasing of troops in Western Europe. Under this concept, mostof the Army, Air Force and Marine Corps units currentlystationed there, as well as their dependents, would bebrought back to U.S. bases. Small contingents of troops wouldreturn periodically to a few European bases for training andmilitary exercises during six-month tours, but the cost ofkeeping them there would be far less than under the currentsystem.   Both the domestic and foreign base-closing provisions arestrongly opposed by the Bush administration and Republicancongressional leaders, and they are bound to prompt spiriteddebate on the House floor.   ---   David Rogers contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
