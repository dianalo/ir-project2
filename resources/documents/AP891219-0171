They rhapsodize about pigeon racing, the sport known as ``thefancy'' and now one of Britain's more popular pastimes.   ``All you see is a pinprick in the sky,'' said Maj. EdwardCamilleri. ``They fly toward you and you hope its yours. Then theyfold their wings, they drop out of the sky, they literally do. Theycome straight down like bullets.''   Says Bernie Bennett, who has 60 pigeons: ``Unless you're apigeon fancier, you just find it very hard to understand, to see aperson out in the garden, like me yesterday, bucketing down withrain, looking for pigeons to come from 100 miles.   ``With pigeons I find one thing and one thing only: You're thejury, you're the prosecution, you are the judge. All that happensdown in your backyard is down to you.''   Camilleri, a retired soldier who runs the Royal Pigeon RacingAssociation, estimates Britain has more than 200,000 pigeonbreeders and racers among its 56 million people.   Nearly 2 million pigeons, many with meticulously documentedpedigrees dating back several avian generations, are registeredwith Camilleri's association alone.   The sport has an honorable history: The ancient Egyptians keptpigeons; Hannibal took them over the Alps; they served in bothworld wars, carrying messages for the Allied intelligence forces inEurope. Thirty-one pigeons were awarded the Dickens Medal, the``Animal Victoria Cross,'' in World War II.   In Britain, pigeons were traditionally associated withbeer-drinking, cloth-capped men, but it has moved upmarket inrecent years, attracting lawyers, actors and titans of industry. Atthe top end of the scale, Queen Elizabeth II maintains a pigeonloft.   Britain's largest pigeon breeder, Louella Pigeon World, is ahigh-tech enterprise that paid a world record 77,000 pounds($120,120) in 1988 for the racing pigeon Emerald II.   ``That, pound for pound, makes it more valuable than the Derbywinner,'' Camilleri said, referring to Britain's most prestigioushorse race.   Emerald II is moved from one secret location to another, becausewith the large sums sometimes at stake in bets and prize money,sabotage and pigeon-napping are not unheard of.   However, high prices don't always guarantee success, Camillerisaid, and a good racing pigeon can start as low as 20 pounds ($32).   ``Stockmanship comes into it, knowing and understandingpigeons,'' he explained. ``They all have their individualcharacters and what you've got to do is understand their characterwell enough and encourage them to come home quicker than the nextpigeon.''   No one knows exactly how pigeons they find their way home afterbeing released, sometimes hundreds of miles away.   ``The sun is definitely one (factor) and magnetic field isdefinitely a second,'' Camilleri said. Research in Europe indicatesthe sense of smell also may help.   There's also a very basic urge.   Most pigeons in Britain are kept on the ``widowhood system.'' Assoon as a hen and cock produce a pair of young, or squeakers,they're separated. Only the males are raced, and the only time theyget to see their hens is when they return to the loft at the end ofa race.   Each fancier's loft is registered and the distance between itand any of the 200 official British ``liberation sites'' measuredto the nearest yard.   Pigeons are bundled into baskets, sometimes the night before arace, and taken to the liberation site in air-conditioned trucks.Each wears a rubber band about the size of a wedding ring on itsleg with the details of where it came from.   The pigeons are all released at the same time. They ascendrapidly, quickly become oriented and head for home.   When they land, the fancier removes the rubber band and puts itin a timeclock that is sealed and taken to the local racing club.The flight distance is divided by the time it took to determine whowon the race.   What is it about pigeons that engenders such passion and loyalty?   ``The fascination about it: you get a few pigeons, you startwinning races, and from then on it's a lot like horse racing, onlycheaper,'' Camilleri said.   ``You can pit your wits against nature.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Friday AMs, Dec. 22</NOTE></DOC>
