His head isshaved and he wears round steel-rimmed glasses. His name isMadan Lal, but for campaign purposes he calls himself &quot;M.K.Mahatma Gandhi.&quot; His party is the Indian Opportunists Party.His aides, smirking big-bellied men wearing stage wigs andcarrying bows and arrows, are dressed as the Hindu religiousfigures Rama and Laxman. The performance is a joke, but onewith a message: that politicans are opportunistic play actorsprepared to exploit even the holiest of India's figures towin a few votes.   India is going into its parliamentary elections next weekwith a sneer. The collapse of two minority governments infour months has disgusted the average Indian. And the pillarof political stability in the past, the Congress (I) Party,has become a personality cult of former Prime Minister RajivGandhi. He's introduced at campaign rallies as &quot;your youngprince.&quot; But as many Indians disdain their prince as supporthim.</LP><TEXT>   So India lurches toward an uncertain future with noperceptible anchor. Political analysts are holding theirbreath over the possibility of another series of weakgovernments -- or, worse, a government committed to theinterest of India's Hindu majority, as promised by theBharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, a front runner. Of the threefront runners -- the BJP, the Congress and the Janata DalParty of V.P. Singhonly the BJP is untested, which adds toits appeal. Both the Congress and the Janata Dal have heldpower and disappointed.   Indian politics has always been a dirty and corrupt game,in which politicans resort to the basest tactics to gainlucrative seats in the government. A favorite: provokingdeadly riots to disgrace competing parties or leaders. Nearlyall of the communal disturbances reported from India, whichseem from a distance the manifestation of crude religiouspassions, are deliberate provocations from politicans.   But for most of the period since 1947, when it gainedindependence from Britain, India had a political lodestar:The Congress Party and its ideal of a secular state, run forand by all the country's various ethnic and religious groups.&quot;We've always prided ourselves that India was not Pakistan,India was not Bangladesh,&quot; says Rashid Uddin Khan, apolitical scientist in New Delhi.   Indian nationalism never degenerated into a tyranny of themajority, as it did in those two Muslim quasi-theocracies.And India's poor, illiterate electorate, though denied much,found power in the vote. Against all expectation in 1977,they booted out the Congress government led by Indira Gandhiand returned it to power when its successors proved inept.They kicked it out again, when it was led by Mrs. Gandhi'sson Rajiv, in 1989. Today the Congress is weaker than ever.   And so in the current election campaign, voters arequestioning the politicians as they never have before: aquestioning made more acute by the roster of candidates,which includes cricketers, a former prostitute, a 78-year-oldbody builder, numerous film stars -- including an actress whoplayed Sita, the Hindu equivalent of the Virgin Mary, in apopular television serial -- and even Vinayak Godse, brotherof the assassin of Mohandas K. &quot;Mahatma&quot; Gandhi.   The choices in next week's elections are grand: thesecularism of the Congress Party; the &quot;Hindu Nation&quot; of theBJP; a pro-poor, pro-lower caste government promised by theJanata Dal. And yet the parties are afraid to articulatetheir fundamental ideologies and risk losing the mainstreamvote.   So the BJP tries to appeal to Hindus with a platformcalling for the construction of a controversial temple,protection for semi-sacred bulls and bullocks and a &quot;WhiteRevolution&quot; -- economic growth through cow, goat and sheepbreeding. The Janata Dal, led by Mr. Singh, prime ministerfor 11 months in 1989 and 1990, stands for &quot;social equity&quot;for poor Indians but vows only to reserve government jobs forthem. Even the Congress, promising &quot;stability,&quot; harpssimplistically on the need for a majority government in NewDelhi. India's true instability -- its economic and socialgaps, its rebellious Sikh, Kashmiri and Assamese separatists-- are ignored. This is ideology reduced to gimmickry.   The biggest danger, however, lies in the dangerousideology of the BJP, which promises special treatment forHindus in a country with 132 million non-Hindus. If the BJPgains power -- or gets close enough to taste it -- it couldexpand its promises to Hindu voters. Hindu fundamentalismcould lurch forward with astonishing speed, as Islamicfundamentalism has in Pakistan or pro-Singhalese policies didin Sri Lanka in the 1950s -- policies that led directly tothe ruinous civil war with the Tamils.   A hint of how special treatments for any one group ofpeople can goad other groups into violence was seen here lastyear when then-Prime Minister Singh, in order to shore up hisweak political position, promised government jobs tolow-caste Hindus. Each of the other major parties, afraid ofalienating the millions of low-caste Hindus, adopted similarpositions. The plan shook the country, threatening a castewar.   The Indian voter has proven himself canny in the past.It's possible that next week voters will reject the BJP'svision of a Hindu state. It's even possible that they willrally round the Congress Party once more. But as thiscampaign has made clear, the secularism on which this countrywas founded has become just one item in a confusedideological bazaar.   It's also clear that Indian voters have never been morecynical. Across the country, politicians are being stoned ontheir campaign trips. A billboard in New Delhi says it all.Referring to the political wranglings over candidacies and&quot;seat adjustments,&quot; it reads: &quot;Here's one seat adjustmentwe'd like to see.&quot; A drawing shows an Indian peasant kickinga politican in the rear end.   ---   Mr. Spaeth is a novelist and journalist in New Delhi.</TEXT></DOC>
