The steroid suspensions included only one prominent player,former Pro Bowl guard Ron Solt of the Philadelphia Eagles. The twosuspended under the substance-abuse policy were far more prominent _cornerback Leroy Irvin, a former All-Pro from the Los Angeles Ramsand tight end Orson Mobley of the Denver Broncos, who played on bothof Denver's Super Bowl teams.   The players came from nine of the NFL's 28 teams. The most,three, were from the Buffalo Bills. There were two each from theGreen Bay Packers, the New York Jets, the Los Angeles Rams and SanFrancisco 49ers. All 15 received four-game suspensions.   Eagles' general manager Harry Gamble said he was disappointedwith Solt, but ``he's still an important part of the football team.''   Bills general manager Bill Polian said he would welcome back histhree suspended players.   ``They are not druggies,'' Polian said. ``They're not felons,they're not bad kids. They're good kids who made a mistake and arepaying the penalty for it.''   Other than Solt, who is recuperating from operations on bothknees, the best-known player in the steroids crackdown is MauriceDouglass, a backup defensive back for the Chicago Bears who spendsthe off-season as an exotic dancer.   Most seemed to fall into the category defined by U.S. DistrictJudge Thomas Hogan on Monday, who in turning down the players' unionrequest to halt the suspensions, acknowledged the crackdown ``couldbe fatal to a marginal player.''   The league, which tested 2,200 players in training camps, said anunspecified number of others tested positive but had been cut ``forlack of playing ability.''   Others suspended for steroids were: running back Sean Doctor andhis linebacker brother, Tom Doctor, both of Buffalo; linebacker MattJaworski of Buffalo, offensive linemen Mike Ariey and Keith Ueckerof Green Bay; defensive end Mark Mraz of the Los Angeles Raiders;tight end Vernon Kirk of the Los Angeles Rams; running back VinceAmoia and wide receiver Bobby Riley of the New York Jets; andrunning back Keith Henderson and nose tackle Rollin Putzier of SanFrancisco.   The NFL Players Association challenged the testing's accuracy,saying players had called the union claiming they were innocent andsuggesting the tests may have mistaken other medication as eithersteroids or ``masking agents'' for the drugs.   But NFL spokesman Joe Browne said, ``We conducted Olympic-calibertesting that takes everything into account.'' Olympic athletes areroutinely tested for steroids.   A league statement, however, acknowledged that the NFL could notguarantee the testing detected or will detect every steroid user inthe league.   The suspended players must remain away from their teams' trainingfacilities until Sept. 27, the NFL said. If the drugs remain intheir system after that date, they will continue to be suspended.   The league said that if another random test found evidence ofsteroids in a suspended player again, he would be banned for therest of the season.</TEXT></DOC>
