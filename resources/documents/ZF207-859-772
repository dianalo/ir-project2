ShererandM;As the 386 chip wins an increasing share of the computer industry's sales,the market for 386 development tools is heating up as well.andM;While debugging tools for the 386 are still not as sophisticated as productsfor DOS, vendors are now developing entries that promise to reduce thisdisparity in the near future.andP;  Meanwhile, several established C compilervendors are currently developing compilers that exploit the capabilities ofthe 386.andM;In September, the Watcom Group Inc. began shipping a 386 version of its C7.0compiler that is designed to challenge the dominant 386 C compilers fromvendors MetaWare Inc. and MicroWay Inc. Meanwhile, C compiler veteran LatticeInc. recently declared its intention to release early next year its own 386 Ccompiler.andM;Using DOS extenders to break the operating system's 640K-byte barrier, thesetools generate 32-bit 386 code capable of addressing as much as 4 gigabytesof protected-mode memory.andP;  Watcom's 386 product works with DOS extenders fromeither Phar Lap Software Inc. or Eclipse Computer Solutions Inc. (formerlyA.I.andP;  Architects Inc.), while Lattice's entry is designed to work with PharLap's extender.andM;&quot;We feel it is inevitable that the market will move in the direction of the386,&quot; said Ian McPhee, president of Watcom in Waterloo, Ontario.andP;  He notedthat the declining prices of 386 machines are the key to their growingpopularity.andM;After establishing its name with its real-mode DOS C product, McPhee said,Watcom is making inroads into the 386 C compiler arena, and hopes to becomeestablished there before the entrance of such large firms as BorlandInternational Inc. and Microsoft Corp.andM;Both companies are leaders in the DOS C compiler arena and, while neither hasannounced a 386 compiler, they are both expected to enter the marketeventually.andM;&quot;When Borland and Microsoft come out with their 386 compilers, they'll becompared against us,&quot; McPhee boasted.andP;  &quot;We'll be there already.&quot;andM;Lattice's 386 compiler, meanwhile, which is due in early 1990, was originallydeveloped for Sun Microsystems Inc.'s 386i Unix workstation.andP;  After that,however, &quot;it was a natural thing for us to do a [DOS] version,&quot; said DavidSchmitt, president of Lattice in Lombard, Ill.andM;&quot;I think the fastest growth in the tools market will be in the 386 area,&quot;Schmitt said.andP;  &quot;The ambitious programming tools can't really flex theirmuscles until they're on the 386.&quot;andM;While C compilers are finally catching up with the capabilities of the 386chip, protected-mode debuggers lag far behind, observers said.andP;  The debuggersnow available are functionally equivalent to Microsoft's old SYMDEB debugger,a symbolic, command-line-driven real-mode tool that Microsoft replaced in1986 with its new CodeView, a full-screen, source-level entry.andM;Increasing StandardsandM;&quot;Since DOS extenders are taking off, a full source-level debugger is almost arequirement,&quot; said Frank Grossman, president of Nu-Mega Technologies, aHudson, N.H., vendor of debugging tools.andP;  &quot;Now you're getting applicationsprogrammers that are dependent on having a debugger like CodeView.&quot;andM;Lattice, MetaWare and Watcom all have full-screen, source-level 386 codedebuggers in the works for 1990, officials at those companies said.andM;Other debugging tools on the market make use of the capabilities of the 386chip without being able to debug its 32-bit code.andP;  On a 386 machine, forexample, Borland's Turbo Debugger can run in one 640K-byte partition while anapplication runs in another, thereby alleviating the battle for memory space.andM;Nu-Mega Technologies' MagicCV utility allows Microsoft's CodeView debugger todo the same thing.andP;  Neither of these products, however, can debug386-specific protected-mode applications.andM;True protected-mode debugging is on the way from third-party developers aswell as compiler vendors.andM;Nu-Mega Technologies, for example, plans to modify its Soft-ICE, a packagethat emulates hardware-based debuggers, by adding the ability to debugprotected-mode 386 applications, Grossman said.andP;  He declined, however, togive a release date for the software.andP;  Intel sells similar tools.andM;For bugs that elude even the best software-based debuggers, meanwhile, ThePeriscope Company Inc. is developing a version of its hardware-baseddebugger, Periscope, that will allow real-time debugging of protected-mode386 code, according to an official at the Atlanta-based company.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
