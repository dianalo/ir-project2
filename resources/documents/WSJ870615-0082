The program to lift the freeze will require pledges from each of the country's main business sectors to hold down prices to levels that will be set in a series of separate negotiations during the next few months.    The government expects the gradual relaxation of the freeze to avert a surge in prices, according to Wages Minister Bengt K.A. Johansson. &quot;The price freeze has had its effect and the situation has calmed down,&quot; he said.    Even so, the government expects the immediate removal of some parts of the price freeze to boost Sweden's year-to-year inflation rate by about 0.7 percentage point. Under the plan outlined Friday, tax increases that come into effect next month on cars and petroleum products would be passed on directly to consumers, as would agricultural price increases approved by the parliament.    The government's original intent in imposing the price freeze was to prevent consumer price increases from rising at a rate that would have prompted Sweden's powerful unions to demand higher wages. Under a two-year contract that ends this year, the unions had the right to renegotiate wages if the country's inflation rate topped 3.2%. </TEXT></DOC>
