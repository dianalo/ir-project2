As a result, five Department componentsare republishing systems of records to make minor changes. The systems notices are reprinted below following a table of contents,and changes to the systems of records have been italicized for public convenience.Included, for example, are editorial revisions which clarify system descriptions,together with changes to the system location, system manager(s) and address,safeguards, and storage sections of the notices. In addition, each of thefollowing organizations is reprinting a revised appendix of system locations:The Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA), the Federal Bureauof Investigation, and the United States Marshals Service. Finally, pursuantto 44 U.S.C. 2102, the EOUSA is modifying a routine use. The routine usewas originally drafted to permit records disclosure to the National Archivesand Records Service (NARS), General Services Administration (GSA), duringrecords management inspections. However, the statute renamed NARS as the``National Archives and Records Administration'' (NARA), and establishedit as a separate agency which nonetheless shares its records managementinspection responsibilities with GSA. The routine use has been modifiedto show that NARA and GSA are separate agencies which continue to shareaccess to records during these inspections. Comments on the routine usemay be addressed to Patricia E. Neely, Staff Assistant, Facilities andAdministrative Services Staff, Justice Management Division, Departmentof Justice, Room 529, 633 Indiana Avenue, NW., Washington, D.C. 20530.Please submit any comments by November 13, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: October 2, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Harry H.

This transaction record mustbe monitored and reviewed on a regular basis to detect any possible misuseof criminal history data. f. Each State Control terminal shall build itsdata system around a central computer, through which each inquiry mustpass for screening and verification. The configuration and operation ofthe center shall provide for the integrity of the data base. 2. Communications: a. Lines/channels being used to transmit criminal historyinformation must be dedicated solely to criminal justice, i.e., there mustbe no terminals belonging to agencies outside the criminal justice systemsharing these lines/channels. b. Physical security of the lines/channelsmust be protected to guard against clandestine devices being utilized tointercept of inject system traffic.3. Terminal Devices Having Access to NCIC: a. All agencies having terminalson the system must be required to physically place these terminals in securelocations within the authorized agency. b. The agencies having terminalswith access to criminal history must have terminal operators screened andrestricted access to the terminal to a minimum number of authorized employees.c.

(Followedby predicate offense from other classification.)</T3>Records Maintained in FBI Field Divisions_FBI field divisions maintainfor limited periods of time investigative, administrative and correspondencerecords, including files, index cards and related material, some of whichare duplicated copies of reports and similar documents forwarded to FBIHeadquarters. Most investigative activities conducted by FBI field divisionsare reported to FBI Headquarters at one or more stages of the investigation.There are, however, investigative activities wherein no reporting was madeto FBI Headquarters, e.g., pending cases not as yet reported and caseswhich were closed in the field division for any of a number of reasonswithout reporting to FBI Headquarters.Duplicate records and records which extract information reported in themain files are also kept in the various divisions of the FBI to assistthem in their day-to-day operation. These records are lists of individualswhich contain certain biographic data, including physical description andphotograph. They may also contain information concerning activities ofthe individual as reported to FBIHQ by the various field offices. The establishmentof these listes is necessitated by the needs of the Division to have immediateaccess of pertinent information duplicative of data found in the centralrecords without the delay caused by a time-consuming manual search of centralindices. The manner of segregating these individuals varies depending onthe particular needs of the FBI Division. The information pertaining toindividuals who are a part of the list is derivative of information containedin the Central Records System. These duplicative records fall into thefollowing categories:(1) Listings of individuals used to assist in the location and apprehensionof individuals for whom legal process is outstanding (fugitives):(2) Listings of individuals used in the identification of particular offendersin cases where the FBI has jurisdiction. These listings include variousphotograph albums and background data concerning persons who have beenformerly charged with a particular crime and who may be suspect in similarcriminal activities; and photographs of individuals who are unknown butsuspected of involvement in a particular criminal activity, for example,bank surveillance photographs:(3) Listings of individuals as part of an overall criminal intelligenceeffort by the FBI. This would include photograph albums, lists of individualsknown to be involved in criminal activity, including theft from interstateshipment, interstate transportation of stolen property, and individualsin the upper echelon of organized crime.(4) Listings of individuals in connection with the FBI's mandate to carryout Presidential directives on January 8, 1943, July 24, 1950. December15, 1953, and February 18, 1976, which designated the FBI to carry outinvestigative work in matters relating to espionage, sabotage, and foreigncounterintelligence. These listings may include photograph albums and otherlistings containing biographic data regarding individuals. This would includelists of identified and suspected foreign intelligence agents and informants:(5) Special indices duplicative of the central indices used to access theCentral Records System have been created from time to time in conjunctionwith the administration and investigation of major cases. This duplicationand segregation facilitates access to documents prepared in connectionwith major cases.In recent years, as the emphasis on the investigation of white collar crime,organized crime, and hostile foreign intelligence operations has increased,the FBI has been confronted with increasingly complicated cases, whichrequire more intricate information processing capabilities. Since thesecomplicated investigations frequently involve massive volumes of evidenceand other investigative information, the FBI uses its computers, when necessaryto collage, analyze, and retrieve investigative information in the mostaccurate and expeditious manner possible. It should be noted that all investigativeinformation, which is placed in computerized form, is actually extractedfrom the main files and that the duplicative computerized information isonly maintained as necessary to support the FBI's investigative activities.Information from these internal computerized subsystems of the ``CentralRecords System'' is not accessed by any other agency. All disclosures ofcomputerized information are made in printed form in accordance with theroutine uses which are set forth below.Records also are maintained on a temporary basis relevant to the FBI'sdomestic police cooperating program, where assistance in obtaining informationis provided to state and local police agencies.Also, personnel type information, dealing with such matters as attendanceand production and accuracy requirements is maintained by some divisions.(The following chart identifies various listings or indexes maintainedby the FBI which have been or are being used by various divisions of theFBI in their day-to-day operations. The chart identifies the list by name,description and use, and where maintained, i.e. FBI Headquarters and/orField Office.

Therefore, informationin this system is disclosed to officials and employees of the Departmentof Justice, and/or all components thereof, who have need of the informationin the performance of their official duties. Personal information from this system may be disclosed as a routine useto any Federal agency where the purpose in making the disclosure is compatiblewith the law enforcement purpose for which it was collected, e.g., to assistthe recipient agency in conducting a lawful criminal or intelligence investigation,to assist the recipient agency in making a determination concerning anindividual's suitability for employment and/or trustworthiness for employmentand/or trustworthiness for access clearance purposes, or to assist therecipient agency in the performance of any authorized function where accessto records in this system is declared by the recipient agency to be relevantto that function. In addition, personal information may be disclosed from this system tomembers of the Judicial Branch of the Federal Government in response toa specific request, or at the initiation of the FBI, where disclosure appearsrelevant to the authorized function of the recipient judicial office orcourt system. An example would be where an individual is being consideredfor employment by a Federal judge.Information in this system may be disclosed as a routine use to any stateor local government agency directly engaged in the criminal justice process,e.g., police, prosecution, penal, probation and parole, and the judiciary,where access is directly related to a law enforcenemt function of the recipientagency e.g. in connection with a lawful criminal or intelligence investigation,or making a determination concerning an individual's suitability for employmentas a state or local law enforcement employee or concerning a victim's compensationunder a state statute. Disclosure to a state or local government agency,(a) not directly engaged in the criminal justice process or (b) for a licensingor regulatory function, is considered on an individual basis only underexceptional circumstances, as determined by the FBI. Information in this system pertaining to the use, abuse or traffic of controlledsubstances may be disclosed as a routine use to federal, state or locallaw enforcement agencies and to licensing or regulatory agencies empoweredto engage in the institution and prosecution of cases before courts andlicensing boards in matters relating to controlled substances, includingcourts and licensing boards reponsible for the licensing or certificationof individuals in the fields of pharmacy and medicine. Information in this system may be disclosed as a routine use in a proceedingbefore a court or adjudicative body, e.g., the Equal Employment OpportunityCommission and the Merit Systems Protection Board, before which the FBIis authorized to appear, when (a) the FBI or any employee thereof in hisor her official capacity, or (b) any employee in his or her individualcapacity where the Department of Justice has agreed to represent the employee,or (c) the United States, where the FBI determines it is likely to be affecedby the litigation, is a party to litigation or has an interest in litigationand such records are determined by the FBI to be relevant to the litigation.Information in this system may be disclosed as a routine use to an organizationor individual in both the public or private sector if deemed necessaryto elicit information or cooperation from the recipient for use by theFBI in the performance of an authorized activity. An example would be wherethe activities of an individual are disclosed to a member of the publicin order to elicit his/her assistance in our apprehension or detectionefforts. Information in this system may be disclosed as a routine use to an organizationor individual in both the public or private sector where there is reasonto believe the recipient is or could become the target of a particularcriminal activity or conspiracy, to the extent the information is relevantto the protection of life or property.Information in this system may be disclosed to legitimate agency of a foreigngovernment where the FBI determines that the information is relevant tothat agency's responsibilities, and dissemination serves the best interestsof the U.S. Government, and where the purpose in making the disclosureis compatible with the purpose for which the information was collected.Relevant information may be disclosed from this system to the news mediaand general public where there exists a legitimate public interst, e.g.,to assist in the location of Federal fugitives, to provide notificationof arrests, and where necessary for protection from imminent threat oflife or property. This would include releases of information in accordancewith 28 CFR 50.2A record relating to an actual or potential civil or criminal violationof the copyright statute, Title 17, United States Code, or the trademarkstatutes. Titles 15 and 17, U.S. Code, may be disseminated to a personinjured by such violation to assist him/her in the institution or maintenanceof a suit brought under such titles.The FBI has received inquiries from private citizens and Congressionaloffices on behalf of constituents seeking assistance in locating individualssuch as missing children and heirs to estates. Where the need is acute,and where it appears FBI files may be the only lead in locating the individual,consideration will be given to furnishing relevant information to the requester.Information will be provided only in those instances where there are reasonablegrounds to conclude from available information the individual being soughtwould want the information to be furnished, e.g., an heir to a large estate.Information with regard to missing children will not be provided wherethey have reached their majority.Release of Information to Members of Congress:Information contained in this system, the release of which is requiredby the Freedom of Information-Privacy Acts, may be made available to aMember of Congress or staff acting upon the Member's behalf when the Memberof staff requests the information in behalf of and at the request of theindividual who is the subject of the record.Release of Information to the National Archives and Records Administration(NARA) and the General Services Administration (GSA):A record from a system of records may be disclosed as a routine use toNARA and GSA in records management inspections conducted under the authorityof 44 U.S.C. 2904 and 2906, to the extend that legislation governing therecords permits.policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining, anddisposing of records in the system:storage:The active main files are maintained in hard copy form and some inactiverecords are maintained on microfilm. Investigative information which ismaintained in computerized form may be stored in memory, on disk storage,on computer tape, or on a computer printed listing.retrievability:The FBI General Index must be searched to determine what information, ifany, the FBI may have in its files. Index records, or pointers to specificFBI files, are created on all manner of subject matters, but the predominanttype record is the name index record. It should be noted the FBI does notindex all individuals who furnish information or all names developed duringthe course of an investigation. Only that information considered pertinent,relevant, or essential for future retrieval, is indexed. In certain majorcases, individuals interviewed may be indexed to facilitate the administrationof the investigation. The FBI has automated that portion of its index containingthe most recent information_15 years for criminal related matters and 30years for intelligence and other type matters. Automation will not changethe ``Central Records System''; it will only facilitate more economic andexpeditious access to the main files. Searches against the automated recordsare accomplished on a ``batch off-line'' basis for certain submitting agencieswhere the name search requests conform to FBI specified formats and alsoin an ``on-line'' mode with the use of video display terminals for otherrequests. The FBI will not permit any organization, public or private,outside the FBI to have direct access to the FBI indices system. All searchesagainst the indices data base will be performed on site within FBI spaceby FBI personnel with the assistance of the automated procedures, wherefeasible. Automation of the various FBI field office indices has been underway for approximately five years; completion is anticipated during FY 1988.This automation initiative has been on a ``day-one'' basis. This indicessystem points to specific files within a given field office. Additionally,certain complicated investigative matters may be supported by specializedcomputer systems or by individual microcomputers. Indices created in theseenvironments are maintained as part of the particular computer system andaccessible only through the system or through printed listings of the indices.The FBI will transfer historical records to the National Archives consistentwith 44 U.S.C. 2103. No record of individuals or subject matter will beretained for transferred files; however, a record of the file numbers willbe retained to provide full accountability of FBI files and thus preservethe integrity of the filing system.safeguards:Records are maintained in a restricted area and are accessed only by agencypersonnel. All FBI employees receive a complete background investigationprior to being hired. All employees are cautioned about divulging confidentialinformation or any information contained in FBI files. Failure to abideby this provision violates Department of Justice regulations and may violatecertain statutes providing maximum severe penalties of a ten thousand dollarfine or 10 years imprisonment or both. Employees who resign or retire arealso cautioned about divulging information acquired in the jobs. Registeredmail is used to transmit routine hard copy records between field offices.Highly classified records are hand carried by Special Agents or personnelof the Armed Forces Courier Service. Highly classified or sensitive privacyinformation, which is elecronically transmitted between field offices,is transmitted in encrypted form to prevent interception and interpretation.Information transmitted in teletype form is placed in the main files ofboth the receiving and transmitting field offices. Field offices involvedin certain complicated investigative matters may be provided with on-lineaccess to the duplicative computerized information which is maintainedfor them on disk storage in the FBI Computer Center in Washington, D.C.,and this computerized data is also transmitted in encrypted form.retention and disposal:As the result of an extensive review of FBI records conducted by NARA,records evaluated as historical and permanent will be transferred to theNational Archives after established retention periods and administrativeneeds of the FBI have elapsed. As deemed necessary, certain records maybe subject to restricted examination and usage, as provided by 44 U.S.C.Section 2104.FBI record disposition programs relevant to this System are conducted inaccordance with the FBI Records Retention Plan and Disposition Schedulewhich was approved by the Archivist of the United States and the U.S. DistrictCourt, District of Columbia. Investigative, applicant and administrativerecords which meet the destruction criteria will be destroyed after 20or 30 years at FBI Headquarters and after 1, 5, 10 or 20 years in FBI FieldOffices. Historical records will be transferred to the National Archivesafter 30 or 50 years, contingent upon investigative and administrativeneeds. The administrative indices and listings described within this Systemwere appraised separately and disposition authority established.

(<T3>12</T3>) This office utilizes it to track the workload of the criminalcourt process from three separate vantage points. First, the workload istracked from the vantage point of the crime or criminal incident. Thisis accomplished by including in PROMIS the complaint number which the policedepartment assigns to a reported crime. With this number, prosecutors canfollow the full history of the court actions arising from the crime eventhough those actions may involve multiple defendants, multiple cases, andmultiple trials and dispositions.(<T3>13</T3>) PROMIS tracks the court workload from the vantage point ofthe accused or defendant. This is achieved by incorporating in PROMIS thefingerprint-based number the police department assigns to the individualfollowing his or her arrest. This identfication number is used again bythe department if the same individual is subsequently arrested. Throughthis number, prosecuting attorneys accumulate criminal history files onoffenders and note incidents of recidivism. (<T3>14</T3>) PROMIS tracks from the vantage point of the court proceedings.This is accomplished by including in PROMIS the docket number the Courtassigns to the case pending before it. With this number, prosecutors tracethe history of any formal criminal action from arraignment through finaldisposition and sentencing, and account for the separate fate of each countor charge. The inclusion of these three numbers is significant. The numbers providea capability to track the criminal incident, the defendant, or the courtactions and provide the basis for the routine communication among the variousFederal, state, local, and foreign law enforcement agencies. (<T3>15</T3>) PROMIS generates, on a recurring basis, five categories ofreports: Misdemeanor calendars, felony calendars, case status reports,workload reports, and special reports.

Those matters which become caseseither by way of indictment or information in addition to the data containedin the investigative reports, also contain copies of indictments, informations,complaints, and all pleadings submitted to the court in connection withthe actual prosecution of the case. These files also contain communicationsbetween the Court and agencies thereof, and the United States Attorney,and all correspondence relative to the case or matter. The files furthercontain psychiatric, chemical and other forensic reports, documentary evidenceand the work product and internal memoranda of the Assistant United StatesAttorney in charge of the investigation compiled in preparation for theprosecution of each case. In those cases which have gone through trialand appeal, the file would further reflect transcripts of the trial, allpleadings and correspondence between the attorneys and the Court of Appeals,and copies of briefs submitted in the prosecution of the Appeal.A <T3>synopsis </T3>record of a matter or case is maintained by means ofa criminal docket card (USA-T7), for all actions through sentencing.
