Results of the London session weren't disclosed, but oil pricesedged upward in response to hopes that producing nations inside andoutside of the cartel would move quickly to stem the recent erosionof the market.   The meeting of non-OPEC officials was called by Egypt and washeld at the Mexican Embassy in London, even though Britain, whichrejects group pricing policies for its North Sea oil, wasn'tinvited.   Another European producer, Norway, declined to attend.   Apart from Egypt, the other invited participants were the SovietUnion, China, Angola, Malaysia, Brunei, Oman, Mexico and Colombia.   ``The meeting is at expert level with no ministers involved,''said a Mexican official, who declined to be identified. ``They justwant to talk about the situation in the market, although obviouslythey are not in any position to take a decision.''   Oil prices have declined by an average of about 20 percent overthe past few weeks amid reports of production excesses and pricediscounting by OPEC members.   On Tuesday, Egyptian oil minister Abdel-Hady Kandil said theLondon meeting was not aimed against the 13-nation cartel, ``but isan attempt by non-OPEC producers to help save the world oil marketfrom further deterioration.''   There also was continued speculation that OPEC would convene itsown emergency meeting. Venezuela initiated calls for such aconference, which were supported by Saudia Arabia and Indonesia,among others. But sources said the Saudis preferred to holdpreliminary, informal talks to set an agenda for a meeting.   Nigeria, whose oil minister Rilwanu Lukman is president of OPEC,has yet to respond to the proposal. Sources said it was unlikely adate would be set before Nigeria replied.   The pricing committee is empowered by OPEC to hold an emergencymeeting of all 13 members of the cartel when prices dropdramatically below the official price of $18 per barrel.   The price slide was interrupted when reports of official concernsurfaced Tuesday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange Wednesday,contracts for April delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S.benchmark crude oil, settled at $15.49 per 42-gallon barrel, up 4cents from the Tuesday close. The contract had gained 8 centsMonday.</TEXT></DOC>
