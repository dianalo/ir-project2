Cohen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LIT SLH AXP </CO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> JUS </G><TEXT>   A federal magistrate ruled that convicted insider trader Dennis B. Levine cannot be compelled to answer questions that could incriminate him because there's still a chance he could face additional criminal charges under state and federal law.    Nina Gershon, a U.S. magistrate, denied a motion by attorneys for Litton Industries Inc. seeking to compel Mr. Levine to answer questions to which he had previously refused to respond. Mr. Levine's &quot;vulnerability to further prosecution is not imaginary or fanciful,&quot; the magistrate said in an order issued earlier this month. At the request of this newspaper, the order was unsealed late last week.    If Mr. Levine were forced to give incriminating answers to Litton's lawyers in pre-trial interviews, known as depositions, those responses could be used against him later by prosecutors, the magistrate said in denying Litton's motion.    Late Friday, Litton filed objections to the magistrate's order, asking a federal judge to require Mr. Levine to reply to some of the 420 questions Mr. Levine formerly declined to answer.    Litton's motion was made as part of a two-year-old case brought by the company against Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. and Mr. Levine. The suit, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that insider trading by Mr. Levine, a former Shearson employee, made Beverly Hills, Calif.-based Litton pay more than it should have to take over Itek Corp. Shearson has said that the suit is without merit.    Litton hired the investment banking firm of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc. in 1983 as its adviser in connection with the Itek acquisition. At that time, Mr. Levine worked in the mergers and acquisitions department of the firm, currently known as Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.    The magistrate said that Mr. Levine &quot;may still be prosecuted by the State of New York for evasion of state income taxes, and by New York or other states for violations of state securities fraud laws.&quot;    She added that Mr. Levine may also face charges by federal authorities outside of Manhattan &quot;for offenses including federal securities fraud, mail fraud and wire fraud.&quot;    Mr. Levine was arrested in May 1986 after the Securities and Exchange Commission accused him of making $12.6 million in profit through illegal trading on inside information. The revelations led to the arrest of convicted insider trader Ivan Boesky.    Mr. Levine pleaded guilty to criminal charges of securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury. He was sentenced to a two-year prison term set to expire in April 1989, but his time was reduced for good behavior. He was released last month from a Manhattan halfway house for federal inmates.    Mr. Levine wasn't granted immunity from further prosecution. But lawyers said Mr. Levine isn't likely to face further federal or state charges. &quot;Technically, anything he says can be used against him,&quot; said Anthony F. Phillips, an attorney representing Shearson in the case. &quot;But prosecutors have better things to do than whack the same guy.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
