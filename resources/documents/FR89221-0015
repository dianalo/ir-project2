Background</ITAG>States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservationand Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or ``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6929(b), have a continuingobligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to,consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous wasteprogram. In addition, as an interim measure, the Hazardous and Solid WasteAmendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'')allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalentinstead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated under HSWA authority.Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federalor State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certainother changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitatedby changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR Parts 260-266, 268, 124, and270.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Utah</ITAG>Utah initially received final authorization on October 24, 1984. On October29, 1986, Utah submitted a program revision application for additionalprogram approvals. On November 25, 1988, EPA published a proposal to approveUtah's application for program revision in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(4).EPA has reviewed Utah's application, and has made a final decision thatUtah's hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirementsnecessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA is grantingfinal authorization for the additional program modifications to the Stateof Utah.EPA has carefully reviewed comments received during the public commentperiod, and has determined that neither comment received provided sufficientbasis to deny authorization of Utah's hazardous waste program. The commentsand EPA's response to the comments are summarized below.A comment was received that the permitting process should, but does not,eliminate dual permits. EPA feels that the commenters are correct thatauthorization of the Utah hazardous waste program for the portions of theFederal program that are the subject of the current authorization applicationwill not completely eliminate the need for facilities to obtain both aState and Federal permit for management of hazardous waste. Federal hazardouswaste laws and regulations continue to change, and while States seekingto maintain an authorized program are required to adopt changes to theFederal program, there will nearly always be a period of time in whichthe authorized State program will not completely parallel the Federal program.During this time period, a complete hazardous waste management permit willconsist of a State-issued portion and a federally-issued portion.EPA encourages States to proceed as rapidly as possible to seek authorizationfor all aspects of hazardous waste regulation, and continues to exploreprocedures to speed up the process. The inability to eliminate the temporaryneed for dual permits is not a basis upon which Utah's request for authorizationshould be denied.Another comment was that the State's agreement to modify or revoke andreissue permits issued under State law to require compliance with the amendedState program must be consistent with State regulations. EPA agrees thatthe State is required to comply with its own laws and regulations. In lightof the previous comment, EPA notes that it may be advantageous to facilitiescurrently holding dual permits to seek modifications to their State-issuedpermits to encompass all requirements for which the State will now haveauthority. In this way, the facility will lessen the burden of dealingwith two separate authorities.Utah is receiving authority to administer all provisions, both HSWA andnon-HSWA, through the August 20, 1985, <T4>Federal Register</T4>.

It is prohibitedto place these wastes anywhere in the State unless the County Commissionand State Legislature approve such placement. Subtitle C of RCRA does notdistinguish between classes or radioactive mixed wastes (i.e., ``high level'',``low level,'' etc.) and the state's regulation of mixed waste is fullyequivalent to EPA's regulations.According to the State statute, the State's Hazardous Waste Committee isrequired to develop a siting plan for hazardous waste treatment, storageand disposal facilities, as well as to certify such sites as suitable forconstruction and operation.The State statute allows for the creation of the Hazardous Waste FacilitiesAuthority, made up of ten members appointed by the Governor, with the taskof managing the State's interests in the transport, storage and disposalof hazardous waste when private industry is not adequately doing the job.Permitting ProgramPursuant to section 3006(g)(1) of RCRA, and in accordance with the Hazardousand Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), EPA has the authority to issueor deny permits or those portions of permits to facilities in Utah forthe requirements and prohibitions in or stemming from HSWA until the State'sprogram is amended to reflect those requirements and prohibitions, andauthorization is received for such portion or portions of the program.EPA and the State of Utah have established a joint permitting process forissuing RCRA permits in the State of Utah. This joint permitting processis established in accordance with section 3006(c)(4) of RCRA. The detailsof the joint permitting process shall be incorporated into the State GrantWork Program.Upon authorization of the State for any of the provisions of HSWA, thespecifics of the Joint Permitting Agreement as set forth in the State GrantWork Program shall be amended to reflect the authorization.The State will administer all permits issued either by EPA or by the State,except that EPA will administer RCRA permits or portions of permits ithas issued to facilities in the State to the extent that those permitsor portions of permits contain prohibitions and requirements pursuant toHSWA that the State program is not authorized to administer. When the Stateeither incorporates the terms and conditions of the Federal permits inState RCRA permits or issues State RCRA permits to these facilities, EPAmay terminate those EPA permits pursuant to 40 CFR Part 270 and will relyon the State to enforce those terms and conditions subject to the termsof the Utah/EPA Hazardous Waste Program Enforcement Agreement.The State agrees to review all hazardous waste permits which were issuedunder State law prior to the effective date of this Authorization and tomodify or revoke and reissue such permits necessary to require compliancewith the amended State Program, the Utah Solid and Hazardous Waste Act(sections 26-14-1 through 26-14-23 of the Utah Code Annotated), the UtahHazardous Waste Management Regulations and the Utah Rulemaking Act (section63-46a-15 of the Utah Code Annotated). The State agrees to modify or revokeand reissue these State permits as RCRA permits, if necessary, within 1year of the date of this Authorization.Indian LandsUtah is not authorized by the Federal Government to operate the RCRA programon Indian lands and this authority will remain with EPA.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Decision</ITAG>I conclude that Utah's application for program revision meets all of thestatutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly,Utah is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste programas revised. Utah now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage,and disposal facilities within its borders and carrying out other aspectsof the RCRA program, subject to the limitation of its program revisionapplication and previously approved authorities. Utah also has primaryenforcement responsibilities subject to program revision limitations, althoughEPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRAand to take enforcement actions under section 3008, 3013 and 7003 of RCRA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Compliance With Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that thisAuthorization will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. This Authorization effectively suspends the applicabilityof certain Federal regulations in favor of Utah's program, thereby eliminatingduplicative requirements for handlers of hazardous waste in the State.It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 271</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Confidential business information,Hazardous materials transportation, Hazardous waste, Indian lands, Intergovernmentalrelations, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Water pollutioncontrol, Water supply.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> This notice is issued under the authority of secs.2002(a), 3006 and 7004(b) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended 42U.S.C. 6912(a), 6926, 6974(b).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 2, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James J.
