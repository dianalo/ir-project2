A general strike closed schools, mass transit and somebusinesses in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital of 1.2 million people900 miles southeast of Moscow, residents said.   The government has sent in troops and tanks to quell ethnicstrife and pro-independence movements in the mountainous Caucasusrepublic, the nation's vegetable and fruit basket and birthplace ofdictator Josef Stalin.   Public gatherings were banned, an 11 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew wasimposed and soldiers patrolled in tanks and armored personnelcarriers, but the unrest continued Monday with a rally at TbilisiState University.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov confirmed twoadditional deaths from Sunday's clash between troops andnationalist protesters, raising the toll to 18. Officials said 100people were injured.   Shevardnadze, sent to Georgia by the ruling Politburo, is aGeorgian who showed some sympathy to nationalists while serving asGeorgia's Communist Party chief from 1972-85.   As party chief, Shevardnadze repeatedly called for mutualrespect and tolerance between Georgians and ethnic Abkhazians, aminority living in the western part of the republic. In 1978, hesupported a law making Georgian the republic's official language, ademand of nationalists.   The republic's current party leader, Djhumber Patiashvili, saidMonday on the evening television news program ``Vremya'' that ``noone expected fatalities'' when troops armed only with clubs andshields were ordered to clear demonstrators from the main street ofTbilisi early Sunday. But he took responsibility for the tragedy.   ``After the troops started to act, they didn't retreat. And thenthe unpredictable happened,'' he said. ``The troops didn't backoff, and unfortunately, innocent people who were not activeparticipants in the demonstration died.   ``Unfortunately, the leaders immediately fled, and not one ofthem was scratched.''   He said that although fatalities came as a surprise, ``ithappened, and we share a common grief, for which we are answering.''   A column of cars carrying flags of mourning moved throughTbilisi Monday with horns honking and headlights shining, thegovernment newspaper Izvestia reported. Some residents donned blackribbons, residents said. Tuesday was officially declared a day ofmourning.   Ethnic unrest has wracked several of the 15 Soviet republics asthe Soviet Union's more than 100 national groups take advantage ofPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of openness to vent longpent-up complaints of discrimination and official insensitivity tolocal needs. Last November, troops and tanks were sent to Armeniaand Azerbaijan to quell unrest that killed more than 90 people.Mass demonstrations have swept the three Baltic republics.   The U.S. State Department on Monday supported the Georgiademonstrations and asked authorities to use restraint in dealingwith peaceful protests. ``What is at issue here is peacefulpolitical expression,'' said spokesman Richard Boucher. ``Wecertainly support them in that.''   Nana Byelovami, a nurse at Central Republic Hospital in Tbilisi,said a 23-year-old pregnant woman who was beaten and a 50-year-oldwoman who inhaled tear gas died late Sunday.   Gerasimov confirmed 18 people had died and said the original 16victims included 10 women and six men, all civilians who weretrampled when soldiers broke up the protest.   Patiashvili denied reports that soldiers moved into the crowdwithout warning, saying authorities persuaded Georgian CatholicChurch leader Ilya II to ask demonstrators to go home at 3:15 a.m.Sunday.   ``He came, and asked, and begged,'' Patiashvili said.   He said armored personnel carriers were moved up in a show offorce _ ``Unfortunately, this did not cool them down, but had theopposite effect.'' A commission is investigating, he said.   As many as 1,000 people massed at the university Monday, saidZurab Zhankarashvili, a member of the Helsinki Watch group who wasat the gathering.   ``The military stood there with their tanks and frightened thepeople off. They shot in the air.''   Sergei Dandurov, a nationalist activist who attended themeeting, said troops jumped from armored personnel carriers andbegan firing in the air. The crowd scattered, with some peoplefleeing into a university building, he said.   Zhankarashvili said soldiers beat two students. The troopsprevented further demonstrations.   ``As soon as a group gathers, they come and break it up,''Zhankarashvili said.   Shevardnadze, 61, arrived in Tbilisi over the weekend, residentssaid. Tass said he met Monday with Georgian intellectuals and newsmedia officials.   Tass said Shevardnadze and candidate Politburo member Georgy P.Razumovsky attended a meeting of local party leaders who called thesituation throughout Georgia ``extremely tense.'' It said theleaders called on party and government officials and plant managersto reject the protesters' demands and ``direct all efforts atstabilizing the situation.''   On April 4, some demonstrators began protesting calls fromAbkhazians to break away from the republic because of allegeddiscrimination by Georgians. Others demanded Georgia secede fromthe Soviet Union because of alleged interference by Moscow in theirpolitical, economic and cultural affairs.   By Friday the crowd numbered 100,000, according to nationalistestimates; a general strike was called, and troops and tanks sentin.   Georgian activists called for the strike to continue Monday.Reports conflicted about the strike's effectiveness in the capital.   ``No one is going to work,'' said Nokri Dzhangarashvili, astudent.   ``Everyone but doctors and breadmakers are on strike,'' said avisitor at the central hospital who refused to give his name.``There is no transport. All stores are closed except food stores.Factories are closed.''   Gerasimov said most businesses in Tbilisi were operating butsome opened late because of disrupted public transport. Heconfirmed that colleges were closed because of the strike.   Police arrested at least six prominent Georgian activists overthe weekend and sought 30 others, said Nanuli Gogua, whose daughterIrina Sarishvili was among those taken into custody by the KGBsecurity force.   The Foreign Ministry said Tbilisi was closed to foreigncorrespondents and to any Soviets reporting for Western newsorganizations.</TEXT></DOC>
