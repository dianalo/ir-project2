The Dow Jones Industrial Average held at 3008.50. Standardandamp; Poor's 500-stock index eased 0.83 to 389.14. And the NasdaqComposite Index fell 0.99 to 516.93.</LP><TEXT>   Analysts said the jobs report this morning probably willdetermine whether the Federal Reserve will ease short-terminterest rates once again or stand firm in the belief thatthe economic recovery is on a sound footing.   A survey of economists by Dow Jones Capital Markets Reportshowed the consensus of 19 economists was that non-farmpayrolls rose 22,000, following July's decline of 51,000, andthat the nation's unemployment moved up a notch to 6.9% from6.8%.   The modest jobs growth expected in the August reportheightened investors' uncertainty. Some think that any growthwill preclude the Fed trying to stimulate the economy withlower interest rates. But others argue that growth is stillsufficiently sluggish to justify a rate cut.   Comments by two Federal Reserve Board members yesterdaydidn't clarify the Fed's thinking. Fed Governor John LaWaresaid in a speech in Washington that he expects the economy togrow at a 3% to 4% annual rate in the second half of 1992.And Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank ofSan Francisco, cautioned that lower rates could contribute tohigher inflation if the economy is overstimulated.   &quot;Although we should facilitate the recovery, we cannotlose sight of our longer-term goal, which is to control, andultimately eliminate, inflation,&quot; he said.   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices were unchanged to lower in active trading.Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 162 millionshares. Decliners on the Big Board led gainers, 856 to 700.                                                                                                          Bond prices dropped. The Treasury's benchmark 30-yearissue lost less than three-eighths of a point, or less than$3.75 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the issuerose to 8.09%.                                                                                                          The dollar rose slightly.
