Incidents, breakdown of different equipment etc. could becaused despite such preventive measures by natural phenomena, by wearand tear of components, or by human error. This report addresses mainlythe question, whether any unacceptable radiological release would occurfrom a disposal facility for high-level waste during its operationalphase, either from routine operation or in the wake of operational incidents.The corresponding safety assessment is based on the conceptual type-Crepository that was developed by Nagra and its contractors in the frameworkof Projekt Gewaehr 1985 and which is described in detail in Nagra reportNTB 85-03. Three different kinds of waste are to be disposed of in thismine-type repository. They originate from reprocessing plants in whichthe spent fuel elements of nuclear reactors are treated. This reportsuggests numerous accident scenarios initiated by both repository internaland external causes. These scenarios are representative for waste-disposalfacilities and they envelop all credible incident situations in suchplants. In summary, with respect to radioactive exposures, it can bestated that no danger arises from the operation of the proposed type-Cwaste repository for the population and the environment.</TEXT></DOC>
