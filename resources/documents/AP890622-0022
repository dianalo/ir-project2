(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Seven semiconductor companiesannounced Wednesday they plan to join forces in an unprecedentedventure to produce computer memory chips and ease the chokeholdJapan has on that vital market.   The firms contributed ``seed money'' for the establishment ofU.S. Memories Inc., a corporation that will make the memory chipsknown as DRAMs that are crucial to the U.S. electronic and defenseindustries.   ``It is clear that the time is right for a collective memorymanufacturing venture in the United States to improve America'smarket position in what is truly a critical technology,'' saidSanford L. Kane, president and chief executive officer of the newlyformed company.   If approved, the venture would break new ground in the federalgovernment's attitude toward cooperation between competingcompanies. The government has been getting steadily more permissivetoward deals that once would have run afoul of antitrust laws on thetheory that concerted action is necessary to meet foreigncompetition.   ``At this point we don't know enough about the transaction tocomment one way or the other,'' Amy Brown, a spokeswoman for theJustice Department's antitrust division, said Wednesday.   Either the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission islikely to look at the deal, although not necessarily conduct afull-scale investigation, she said.   The corporation's preliminary business plan calls for thecompletion of a plant in 1990 and high-volume production of thedynamic random access memory chips, or DRAMs, to begin in the firsthalf of 1991.   Kane said the corporation's first product will be standard4-megabit DRAMs based on design and manufacturing technology to belicensed from International Business Machines Corp.   The plan also says that U.S. Memories expects to raise roughly$500 million from companies that invest in the corporation and $500million from borrowings.   Memory chips are a vital link of the electronics ``food chain,''and many U.S. industry and government officials say it isunacceptable to rely heavily on chips made in Japan for computers,work stations, military gear and other products.   Japanese firms control nearly 80 percent of the worldwide DRAMmarket, which they were able to dominate by sustaining $4 billion inlosses in 1985-86 to knock out their American competition, accordingto the Semiconductor Industry Association.   The number of U.S. companies producing DRAMs for sale on the openmarket, an area in which they once were leaders, fell dramaticallyfrom 11 in 1980 to three this year. The three are Texas InstrumentsInc., Micron Technologies Inc., and Motorola Inc., which recentlyre-entered the business.   IBM is a huge manufacturer of DRAMs, but only for internal use.Kane, who will be its chief executive, was formerly a vice presidentof industry operations for IBM's General Technology Division.   The companies that gave money to plan the corporation wereAdvanced Micro Devices Inc., Digital Equipment Corp.,Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM, Intel Corp., LSI Logic Corp. and NationalSemiconductor Corp.   Kane said the seven partners must stillobtain enough funds tolaunch the venture, successfully negotiate a technology transferagreement with IBM, create a detailed business plan and get afavorable antitrust agreement.   ``It is absolutely clear that we'll need more than the seven wehave now,'' he added.   Kane said U.S. Memories would work closely with Sematech, theAustin, Texas-based research consortium that was one of the firstsuch cooperative efforts in the United States. Sematech makes smallquantities of chips to test manufacturing processes and equipment.   Contacted in Tokyo on Thursday, a spokesman for NEC Corp.,Japan's largest semiconductor maker, said he could not commentbecause ``there are too many unknown things'' about the venture.   The Electronic Industries Association of Japan, a major groupingof semiconductor companies and other electronics makers, also had``no specific comment'' on a U.S. venture because ``details have yetto be known,'' a spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
