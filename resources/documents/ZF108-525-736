 TheGallery line includes two single monitor units (models 125 and 135), and twodouble monitor units (models 225 and 235).andP;  The model 125 features a single25&quot; monitor for small to medium sized videoconferences.andP;  The 225 offers two25&quot; monitors, good for graphics, slides and other visual aids.andP;  The 135 and235 feature 35&quot; monitors for larger conferences.andM;Each system includes at least one high-resolution camera and full-duplex(two-way) synchronized audio with a choice of two audio subsystems.andP;  Acontrol unit that comes standard with all the systems is provided for easyaccess to features such as pan, tilt, zoom and focus.andP;  Two other optionalcontrol units, a wireless remote and a touch screen unit, are also available.andM;Additional options include VCRs, auxiliary cameras, a slide presentationsystem, color video printer and a telephone bridge for audio only conferenceparticipants.andM;The Gallery units interface to Compression Labs' Rembrandt video codes.andO;Pricing starts at $23,000 for the base model 125 (without codec).andP;  A fullyconfigured Gallery 235 system is priced at $60,000 (without codec).andP;  Fancystuff, but oh so nice.andM;Concept CommunicationsandM;Concept Communications' new TeleTravler is a full-motion, interactivevideoconferencing system targeted specifically at large firms with privateT-1 networks.andM;The codec unit is a small black box that houses a video and audio processor.andO;Just connect a video camera, monitor, speakerphone and T-1 line to the unit'soutside receptors and you've set up the entire system.andM;The peripheral package of equipment for use with TeleTravler includes a JVChigh-resolution camera, a JVC 19&quot; color monitor and an NEC VoicePointspeakerphone that provides two-way audio and features four microphones forcoverage of an entire room.andM;TeleTravler is compatible with Concept Communications' previously distributedImage 30 videoconferencing system.andP;  The codec is priced at $5,995.andP;  Theperipheral package is available for $3,500.andM;HarrisandM;The Anamix I allows you to conduct a videoconference with up to eightparticipants.andP;  It's a multimedia system which means it provides full motionvideo with synchronized voice, and allows the exchange of data and graphics,all in living color.andM;The system consists of a hub unit and from three to eight nodes.andP;  The hub isa video and audio switch that provides the multi-site capability.andP;  Each nodeincludes a PC or compatible, camera, microphone, codec printed circuit cardsand Harris' Telos software.andP;  The node network can be linked via microwave,fiber optics or satellite, so distance is not a problem.andM;Participants can be viewed individually or in groups of four.andP;  Individualscan choose who they want to look at with a keystroke, or they can use thevoice-actuated feature.andP;  Audio is combined from all sites with minimum echo,so everyone is heard clearly.andP;  The system even lets you conference and workon your PC at the same time.andM;Nodes can be added to the basic system with expansion cards.andP;  A node can beequipped with two cameras: one for the participant and the other forgraphics.andP;  Other peripheral equipment such as online printers, fax machinesand VCRs can also be added.andM;The system can be purchased in bundled or unbundled packages.andP;  The hub ispriced at $25,000.andP;  Each node is $20,000.andP;  And the expansion cards which letthe system grow from three to eight nodes cost $3,000 each.andM;Image DataandM;Image Data's Photophone sends still-frame color or black-and-white photoquality pictures over ordinary phone lines in seconds.andP;  The instrument's highresolution images make it useful for such applications as viewing laboratoryslides, examining colors and textures of fabric and identifyingsurface-finish defects.andM;The Photophone is easy to use.andP;  It's like a videofax machine but it uses acamera to capture 3-D images.andP;  All the user has to do is point the camera atthe image to be sent and press the &quot;send&quot; button.andP;  The machine takes care ofthe rest.andP;  The intended recipient will then receive a clear image, 15 to 30seconds later, on his Photophone.andM;The Photophone can store up to 1,200 images on its 21-Mb internal hard diskdrive, letting users establish a large file of easily accessible images.andP;  Upto 80 images can also be stored on floppy disk, plus an additional 10 in theunit's temporary memory.andM;A black-and-white, portable system with camera, monitor and electronics costs$11,982.andP;  The color system ranges from an electronic box only (no camera ormonitor) for $12,995, to a system with camera and monitor for $15,837.andM;NECandM;The T1 Rendez-View system supports two-way, full motion video, audio andgraphics over digital networks.andP;  The system comes with a 30&quot; audiencemonitor, 12&quot; preview monitor, camera and NEC audio echo canceller system.andM;The video codec for use with this system is NEC's VisuaLink 3000.andP;  It's adigital television transmission terminal that can be used for domestic orinternational teleconferencing.andP;  Audio and video signals, along with otherdigital signals from fax machines, electronic writing boards or graphicstablets can be transmitted simultaneously.andM;PictureTelandM;PictureTel recently introduced two new videoconferencing systems: theV-3100RD; and the V-3235.andP;  Both are based on the company's V-3100videoconferencing system with remote control camera, full-duplex audio, colormonitor and PictureTel's software-based C-3000 video codec.andP;  Each new systemfulfills a specialized business need.andM;The V-3100RD is a portable system that comes packaged in two durable cases,easily handled by two individuals.andP;  So there's not a whole lot to schleppwhen you want to hold a conference away from the main office.andM;The V-3235 was developed for group meetings where large monitors are needed.andO;The system comes with two 35&quot; color monitors, easily seen by large audiences.andO;It also has built-in still-frame video graphics and can be configured forhigh resolution graphics.andM;Both systems include such features as &quot;Echo Erase&quot; which minimizes echo inrooms without acoustical treatment and &quot;windowing&quot; which enables users to seethe images they are sending in a small window in the corner of the screenwhile simultaneously viewing an incoming image on the same screen.andM;PictureTel's HVQ image compression technology employed in both systems allowsusers to transmit and receive motion images over dial-up digital networks, sosetting up a videoconference is as easy as making a phone call.andM;Prices for the V-3100RD and the V-3235 are $54,900 and $80,000.andM;US SprintandM;US Sprint's Meeting Channel provides two-way, full-motion videoconferencingover its worldwide network.andP;  The company offers a variety of equipment forsale and rent, and also provides access to both public and private videoteleconferencing rooms.andM;The rooms have various features, such as two video screens for the viewing ofparticipants and graphic displays, audio systems, slide systems, audiointerface for audio-only participants and video printers.andM;Although the network is digital, it is also fully compatible with analogsatellite transmission, providing access to analog sites in the US such ashotels, colleges and public television stations.andM;All that is required for a company to join the Meeting Channel is a dedicatedT-1 line from their facility to US Sprint's nearest point-of-presence (POP).andO;Once the T-1 line is in place, customers are billed in half-hour incrementsfor domestic conferences or hourly for international conferences.andM;A nice inhouse solution.andM;Video PlexandM;&quot;Videoplex&quot; is an electronic video multiplexer that can process from four to16 live video signals and display them simultaneously on a single TV screen.andO;Both black-and-white and color versions are available.andM;The video sources (pictures) are fed to the unit in the form of standardvideo signals.andP;  They are combined at the output into a single video signal ina pattern of small, adjacent pictures.andM;Basic configurations include a 4x4 matrix (16 pictures), a 3x3 matrix (ninepictures), a 2x2 matrix (four pictures) and various composite matrix designs(e.g.andP;  one large picture in the middle of the screen surrounded by 12 smallerimages).andM;VideoTelecomandM;Videoplex units come standard with control keyboards that provide on-screentext, background shading to make the text easier to read and a picturemasking capability.andP;  Also included with each unit is a memory board,lettering board and a number of input (processing) boards for each videosource.andP;  The multiplexers plug into the PC monitor and can then be programmedto display particular picture configurations on the screen.andM;Prices range from $12,000 for the model MDC 4 (four channel) multiplexer to$42,000 for the MDC 16 (16 channel).andM;For local or long distance videoconferencing, the Conference System 300provides complete video, audio and data capabilities.andP;  It's got a built-incodec for full-motion video compression and a built-in, two-way audio systemwith acoustic echo canceller.andM;The system includes two 20&quot; monitors, two cameras, two tabletop microphonesand a remote control.andP;  An IBM AT compatible PC is also thrown in for datafeatures.andM;All of these wonderful pieces of equipment offer the flexibility for amultitude of conference room setups.andP;  One monitor can display callers, whilethe other lets you run programs on the PC or access data.andP;  You can send dataand graphic images to other sites.andP;  With the auxiliary camera, you can cut toa product demonstration taking place in another part of your conference room.andO;The possibilities are virtually endless.andM;As if all of this weren't quite enough, the back panel on the CS300 hasconnectors for add-on applications like a VCR, fax machine or printer.andP;  Andsince the system is software-based, enhancements can be made via an MS DOScompatible diskette.andM;The CS300 can be used in any room with a standard 120VAC outlet and theappropriate data line.andP;  No electrical or acoustical modifications arenecessary.andM;ViewphoneandM;Viewphone distributes the &quot;Viewphone,&quot; manufactured by KDD/Mitsubishi ofJapan.andP;  The Viewphone is a desktop video telephone that transmits audio,still pictures and full motion, color images over a single 64kbps digitaltelephone circuit.andM;Because audio and image are handled on the same digital line, using theViewphone is as easy as using the telephone.andP;  Video and audio signals aretransmitted at 10 frames per second.andP;  The desktop video phone, includingcodec, retails for $20,000.andP;  Or you can rent it on a monthly basis for $600.andM;Not cheap, either way.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
