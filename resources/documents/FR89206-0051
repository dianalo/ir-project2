CPAR was created to helpthe Construction Industry regain its competitive edge nationally and internationallyby building on the foundation of the existing Corps Construction Randamp;DProgram and laboratory resources through an expansion and leveraging effectthat cost-shared partnerships provide. The objective of CPAR is to facilitateresearch, development and application of advanced technologies throughcooperative Randamp;D, field demonstration, licensing agreements and othermeans of technology transfer and reduction-to-practice. Advancing the productivityand competitiveness of the U.S. Construction Industry will provide savingsin construction costs for the Government and U.S. industries, and resultin a boost to the U.S. economy in general. Randamp;D efforts conducted underCPAR will be based on topics included in the Corps Construction Randamp;DProgram and topics suggested by the Construction Industry that can be effectivelyaddressed by a partnership and benefit both the Corps and the ConstructionIndustry. Participation in CPAR is open to any U.S. private firm, including corporations,partnerships, limited partnerships and industrial development organizations;public and private foundations; academic institutions; non-profit organizations;units of State and local governments; and others who have interest in andthe capability to address CPAR objectives. As provided by law, specialconsideration will be given to small business firms and consortia involvingsmall business firms. Preference will be given to business units locatedin the United States that agree to substantially manufacture the productsdomestically. Consideration will be given to a potential partner that issubject to the control of a foreign company or government if that foreigngovernment permits U.S. agencies, organizations, or other persons to enterinto cooperative research and development agreements and licensing agreements.The cost of each CPAR project will be shared by the Corps and the ConstructionIndustry partner(s). Specific cost-sharing terms will be negotiated foreach proposed project prior to submission of the proposal to Headquarters,U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (HQUSACE) for approval. ``In-kind'' servicesand/or use of facilities may be considered in arriving at a cost-sharingagreement. As required by law, not more than fifty (50) percent of thecost of a CPAR project will be provided by the Corps and not less thanfive (5) percent of the Construction Industry partner's share of the costmust be paid in cash. The Corps may contribute personnel, services, facilities,property, intellectual property and money. The Construction Industry partner(s)may contribute personnel, services, facilities, property, intellectualproperty and money. No costs previously incurred by the Corps or the ConstructionIndustry partner(s) on the subject matter of the CPAR project may be recoveredin the cost-sharing agreement. An agreement specific to each project will be negotiated between the Corpsand the Industry partner(s). The agreement will contain, in addition tothe cost-sharing terms, all other conditions and responsibilities necessaryto complete the project, including rights to inventions. In addition tohaving the authority to grant the partner(s) licenses to Government-ownedor jointly-developed inventions, the Corps has authority to waive, in wholeor in part, the right of ownership to any invention made by the partner(s)or employees of the partner(s) during the project, subject to reservationby the Government of a non-exclusive, irrevocable, paid-up license to practicethe invention or have the invention practiced by or on behalf of the Government.Initially CPAR will focus on four major areas: design improvement, improvedconstruction site productivity, advanced materials and technology transfermanagement. Any idea for improving construction productivity will be considered,however.

Corps laboratories will submit their recommended proposal summaries toHQUSACE (CERD-C) for consideration under the CPAR Program. An initial screeningwill be made to ensure that all proposals meet the minimum criteria ofbeing fully cost-shared and appropriate to the CPAR Program. The CPAR proposalswill be reviewed and selected by the CPAR Executive Committee in HQUSACE.The CPAR Executive Committee is composed of senior-level HQUSACE managers.The Director of Civil Works, HQUSACE, will act on the recommendations ofthe CPAR Executive Committee in approving the program. All information (data) furnished by the Construction Industry partner(s)will be used for evaluation purposes only and will be safeguarded fromunauthorized disclosure in accordance with applicable laws. Classifiedinformation (data) will be handled in accordance with Army regulations.Additional Requirements Applicants are reminded that a false statement may be grounds for denialor termination of funds and grounds for possible punishment by a fine orimprisonment. Except where declared by law or approved by the head of agency,no award of Federal funds shall be made to an applicant who is delinquenton a Federal debt until the delinquent account is made current or satisfactoryarrangements are made between affected agencies and the debtor. No awardwill be made to a debarred or suspended contractor. <ITAG tagnum="81">Classification </ITAG>This document is not a major rule requiring a regulatory analysis underExecutive Order 12291 because it will not have an annual impact on theeconomy of $l00 million or more, nor will it result in a major increasein costs or prices for any group, nor have a significant adverse effecton competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or onthe ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprisesin domestic or export markets. It is not a major federal action requiringan environmental assessment under the National Environment Policy Act.The CPAR Program does not involve the mandatory payment of any matchingfunds from a State or local government, and does not affect directly anyState or local government. Accordingly, the Corps determined that ExecutiveOrder 12372 is not applicable to CPAR. This notice does not contain policieswith Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalismassessment under Executive Order 12612. CPAR is being carried out underthe authority of Section 7, Water Resources Development Act of 1988 (Pub.L. 100-676).<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 31, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Frank R.
