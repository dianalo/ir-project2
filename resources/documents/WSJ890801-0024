For Britain's main phone company, the pact offers control of one of the biggest U.S. providers of electronic information services, a small but fast-growing segment of the global telecommunications market. McDonnell Douglas's Tymnet unit and related data-communications businesses have annual pretax profit of roughly $25 million on sales of $250 million, U.K. analysts estimate.    If approved by regulators, the Tymnet transaction would intensify competition between British Telecom and American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., which last Friday won U.S. court clearance to expand its tiny U.S. role in electronic information services. Yesterday, a number of electronic publishing companies gained on speculation that ATandamp;T might try to make a foray into the business through a friendly or perhaps even hostile acquisition. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Telerate Inc., 67%-owned by Dow Jones andamp; Co., gained 75 cents to $16; Gannett Co. rose 87.5 cents to $49.875; Knight-Ridder Inc. climbed $2.25 to $58.25; Mead Corp. soared $4 to $44.50; and McGraw-Hill Inc. surged $1.50 to $76.75.    For McDonnell Douglas, the Tymnet sale represents part of a strategic push back to its core business: aerospace. The company had targeted information systems as a high-growth area, but some $340 million in losses by that sector during the past five years have dashed those plans. &quot;This cutback is a disappointment to me since it represents an abandonment&quot; of McDonnell Douglas's &quot;original goal to be a leading supplier of broad-based information systems,&quot; Chairman John F. McDonnell wrote in a letter to employees yesterday.    The financially battered St. Louis company also announced its intention to sell its North American field-service business, which maintains and repairs computers. In addition, it disclosed that it intends to convert its Information Systems International subsidiary -- which makes computers and acts as a sales agent for the company's entire information-systems operation -- into a separate public entity based in the U.K. Analysts believe it is the first step in completely selling off that business.    In Big Board trading, McDonnell Douglas closed yesterday at $74.75, up $1.50.    The purchase would be British Telecom's second major shopping spree in the U.S. this year. Last January, it agreed to pay an eye-popping $1.5 billion for a 22% stake in U.S.-based mobile-phone concern McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. Since the U.K. government privatized British Telecom in 1984, the former British phone monopoly has been pushing beyond its reliable but low-growth main business -- providing more than 95% of Britain's telephone service.    The U.S. market, in particular, &quot;is the way to go&quot; for British Telecom, said Tony Booth, managing director of British Telecom International. Besides being the world's largest telecommunications market, the U.S. is home base for many of the world's multinational companies. British Telecom sees those companies, whose U.K. units are already among its biggest customers, as important revenue sources. The Tymnet purchase, Mr. Booth said, would further boost British Telecom's services to those U.S.-based multinationals.    Tymnet's customers include more than a third of the 100 largest U.S. corporations. In essence, its business is providing a computer-controlled network for shuttling electronic messages. The type of message varies widely, and includes electronic mail, records of credit-card transactions and computer-generated invoices and purchase orders. Besides buying the Tymnet network, British Telecom also plans to buy some related McDonnell Douglas units that run such specialized message services over Tymnet.    Aerospace analysts praised the timing of the Tymnet divestiture and the other moves disclosed by McDonnell Douglas, whose Long Beach, Calif., aircraft business is going through a wrenching restructuring. Paul Nisbet, of Prudential-Bache Securities, figured that the information-services group eventually will be whittled down to a more manageable operation with annual sales of about $525 million, down from last year's sales of $1.3 billion.    Besides the sales of Tymnet and the field-service business, McDonnell Douglas said in June that it had reached an agreement to sell Telecheck, a check-authorization service. The annual revenue of the three businesses is about $400 million. Moreover, McDonnell Douglas late last year sold some of its health-related information businesses.    Mr. Nisbet estimated that McDonnell Douglas could ultimately realize as much as $400 million in capital gains from all its information systems-related sales. But even more important, he said, is that it will allow the company &quot;to focus its assets and attention on aerospace, and that's very good news for them.&quot;    McDonnell Douglas, which posted a $48 million loss for the second quarter, is trying to bring several major military and commercial airplanes on line simultaneously.    Mr. McDonnell, the company's chairman, noted in his letter to employees that the information-systems group and the aircraft-manufacturing sector haven't been adequately &quot;interactive and synergistic.&quot;    Indeed, as part of its announcement yesterday, McDonnell Douglas emphasized its &quot;increased commitment&quot; to its systems-integration business, which supplies three-dimensional computer-generated models to help build airplanes.    Mr. McDonnell concluded that, despite a small second-quarter profit, the information-systems group has been unable &quot;to implement several strategic requirements.&quot; He said it has failed, for instance, to attract a &quot;major voice communications partner&quot; and has not developed a product that could &quot;powerfully differentiate us from our competitors.&quot;    But because of its high growth, the market for services such as Tymnet is a plum for old-line phone companies such as British Telecom. Both the U.S. and European markets jumped nearly 45% last year -- to $5.9 billion in the U.S. and $2.98 billion in Europe, according to Systems Dynamics Ltd., a British-based communications consulting concern. </TEXT></DOC>
