Craigsaid a week before opening night that he had made his decision, but that hewould not announce anything until the end of the Bay Bridge Series. That iswhen Uribe was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a bruised right heel.;   Benjamin proceeded to go 1 for 22. He was sent to Triple-A Phoenix lastFriday to work on his hitting (too far off the plate), and Uribe was activatedthat day. He said he is not concerned about what the future might hold forBenjamin.;    &quot;I never tried to put pressure on myself,&quot; said Uribe, whoprobably will continue to be rested once every few games until returning tohis normal form. &quot;Everybody knows I can play my position. I know they gave achance to the kid. There's nothing wrong with that.;    &quot;In spring training,if you keep your body in shape, your mind together, that's the main thingabout it.&quot;;    Craig had said a week into this season: &quot;I won't say who Ioriginally decided on, because I don't want either of them to know they didn'twin. This way, they both think they won the job down there.&quot;; McGEE DOUBTFULTODAY: Willie McGee missed his first game of the season because of tightnessin his right hamstring, and Craig indicated that the center fielder is notlikely to return this homestand.;    &quot;He'll probably miss more than a day ortwo -- I don't know for sure,&quot; Craig said. &quot;The cold doesn't help. It was hotand humid in St. Louis, and it was easier for him to get loose. That's thedifference.&quot;; FARM REPORT: Triple-A pitchers Rafael Novoa (shoulder) andJohnny Ard (elbow) were scheduled to pitch in the extended spring training.Both have been recovering from tendinitis. . . . Francisco Oliveras (2-0)started and scattered five hits over seven innings in Phoenix's 10-0 victorySunday at Tacoma. Oliveras figures to be one of the first pitchers called upwhen needed. . . . Jim Wilson went 3 for 4 with a homer and four RBIs in thatFirebird victory. . . . Dan Rambo, who was 12-2 last year for Class A SanJose, improved to 2-0 for Double-A Shreveport on Sunday by striking out nineand scattering five hits over six innings of a 5-0 victory.; ETC.: The Giantsled the league through Sunday with a .987 fielding percentage. They also ledthe majors with 17 homers. The last Giants team to lead the majors in thatcategory was in 1972 with 150.
