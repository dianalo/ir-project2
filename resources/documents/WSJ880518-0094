It would be IBM's first collaboration with Los Alamos since the 1960s, when a joint effort developed technology used in IBM's 360 and 370 series of computers. Neither party would disclose how much the current project will cost, or how the expense is to be shared. Cray Research Inc., Minneapolis, dominates the supercomputer market, and the New Mexico nuclear weapons development facility relies primarily on Cray supercomputers.    The new collaboration calls for an IBM model 3090-200E supercomputer, introduced three years ago, to be integrated into the Los Alamos computer network. Los Alamos will set programming and user standards for an even more powerful machine, which is to be built by enhancing the IBM supercomputer.    Supercomputers, the most powerful calculating machines in use, are capable of performing millions of computations a second, and are used for such applications as weather forecasting, simulating nuclear reactions and other complex phenomena that are most easily observed and studied by such simulation. </TEXT></DOC>
