The police said they were breaking up a Vietnamese-runblack market and vice racket. In riots that ensued, threemore Vietnamese were killed, setting off a homeward exodus.</LP><TEXT>   The events in Bulgaria are an extreme example of theracism and harassment that face many of the 140,000Vietnamese &quot;guest workers&quot; who are still in Eastern Europeand the Soviet Union.   As Hanoi tries to adjust to the new world of non-Communistregimes in much of Eastern Europe, thousands of Vietnameseguest workers are returning home with mixed feelings aboutcommunism. Many of them express admiration for capitalistmanagement techniques and envy of the personal freedom nowspreading throughout Eastern Europe -- though the chaos alsofound in those post-Communist societies has tempered theirenthusiasm for seeking any similar radical transformation athome.   &quot;Things like East Germany will never happen in Vietnam, noway, that's a dream,&quot; says one Vietnamese worker who spenteight years in the Communist half of Germany that no longerexists on its own. For significant change to come to Vietnam,&quot;one has to wait until the old guys pass away,&quot; he says,referring to the septuagenarian Politburo members who runVietnam.   Conversations with returned workers -- some arranged bythe government and some conducted in private -- provide aglimpse into an area of Communist Vietnam's relations withthe now-defunct Soviet bloc that was long obscured by slogansabout &quot;proletarian solidarity.&quot;   Vietnam had sent the cream of its labor force to docontract work in East bloc factories and constructionbrigades since 1978. This helped cash-starved Hanoi pay itsdebts to the socialist countries, as a percentage of theworkers' salaries was deducted by the host countries. Theworkers also sent more than $90 million a year in wages backto Vietnam, a Vietnamese official says.   Many Vietnamese had positive experiences. Le Ngoc Diep, amechanic in an East Berlin shoe factory from 1987 until hisreturn late last year, earned enough to send home twomotorbikes and seven bicycles, which were resold at greatprofit.   When a fellow worker tells of racist &quot;skinhead&quot; youthsattacking Vietnamese workers, the mechanic interrupts. &quot;Thoseattacks were by extremists who hated Communists or foreignersin general,&quot; he says. The government, he says, &quot;dideverything possible to protect the Vietnamese.&quot;   But, unable to compete with shoes made in West Germany,the factory that employed Mr. Diep laid off many workers.Eighteen Vietnamese from his factory fled to West Germanybefore the two Germanys were unified last year. &quot;They wantedto have a better living standard and freedom in the West,&quot; hesays.   Mr. Diep says the factory did the right thing: &quot;It forcedpeople to work harder to produce better-quality shoes. If youproduce bad shoes and you can't sell them, the factory can'tpay your salaries.&quot;   His attitude is helped by the fact that the East Germansgave workers who returned to Vietnam $1,840 in terminationpay and 70% of their salaries while they waited for flightshome. Around 34,000 Vietnamese have returned from Germany,and 20,000 more are waiting to return.   But Doan Van Loi has different memories of Europe, fromhis stay in Bulgaria. At the General Department of Roads andBridges in Sofia, he earned 220 leva a month -- less than $8at the new exchange rate set early this year. &quot;It wasn'tenough to eat, not to talk of saving,&quot; he says. To earn extramoney, he worked as a handyman; but when he returned homelate at night, Bulgarian toughs often beat him up.   Nguyen Van Dung, a construction worker in Bulgaria,recalls a mob assault in December, when &quot;people of Sofiatogether with criminals released from prison and even thepolice joined to beat up the Vietnamese.&quot; Many were injured.   The Bulgarian brutality was played out against thebackdrop of a deteriorating economy. Most of the 15,000Vietnamese still in Bulgaria have been laid off; unable toearn a living, many have turned to black-market activities,prostitution and pimping, Bulgarian news reports say.   Bulgaria's Balkan Airlines only recently began flyingVietnamese home. Like thousands of others who have returnedhere, they will join an army of unemployed that alreadytotals 1.7 million by official count. The actual number couldbe four times that, some people in Hanoi say. Vietnam's totalpopulation was estimated last year at 68.5 million.   Despite the intimidating presence of a Vietnameseofficial, several returning Vietnamese suggested ininterviews they would like to see some of the changes theysaw in Eastern Europe applied at home.   Mr. Diep, who worked in the German shoe factory, says: &quot;Myonly aspiration is that we should reform our system so thatas a worker I can go to a factory and work to the fullest ofmy capacity and get every penny worth {for} my labor. That'swhat has been done in Germany, and we in Vietnam should haveit.   &quot;Right now in my country, there are so many problems, andactually there isn't absolute justice or equality. There aremany things illogical and irrelevant.&quot;   Despite such indications of discontent, Vietnamese sayreturning workers aren't likely to pose serious problems forthe Communist Party. They &quot;saw the unfolding events like asilent movie, a storm that swept away&quot; communism in EasternEurope, says one Vietnamese. Most of them came back with somesavings and are likely to try to set up a small businessrather than look for factory jobs, he says.</TEXT></DOC>
