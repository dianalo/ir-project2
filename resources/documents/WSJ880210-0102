Stamford, Conn.-based GTE posted a 25% profit rise to $334 million, or 99 cents a share, from $268 million, or 79 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 2% to $4.1 billion from $4 billion.    Excluding nonoperating gains and losses, GTE said fourth-quarter earnings rose 3%.    GTE's latest fourth-quarter profit included a $26 million gain from pension settlements and the sale of real estate. The 1986 fourth quarter included charges of $30 million from retiring high-coupon debt and from the retroactive repeal of investment tax credits under the 1986 Tax Reform Act.    United Telecommunications, based in Kansas City, Mo., reported fourth-quarter net rose 3.1% to $29.1 million, or 29 cents a share, from $28.3 million, or 28 cents a share. The 1986 fourth quarter included $781,000 of profit from discontinued operations. Revenue in the quarter rose 7.4% to $792.3 million from $738 million.    Both companies' results were significantly helped by the narrowing losses at the US Sprint venture. Huge losses at US Sprint have particularly hurt United Telecommunications' results in past quarters. The two companies split US Sprint's losses 50-50.    GTE said US Sprint's pretax operating losses narrowed to $116 million in the fourth quarter from $198 million in the 1986 fourth quarter and from $166 million in the 1987 third quarter. GTE said it still expects US Sprint to break even in this year's fourth quarter or by the beginning of next year. Losses have been narrowing at US Sprint as it stops leasing phone lines from American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and other carriers and puts phone traffic on its own lines. But the unit's progress has been marred by big write-offs for billing problems and the junking of its old microwave phone network. US Sprint, which wrote the old network down to its salvage value in last year's second quarter, has been trying to sell it.    Solving US Sprint's billing troubles has proven more difficult than anticipated, and customers still are dunned for money they don't owe. Many, including the parents of one commissioner on the Federal Communications Commission, have simply canceled service.    Management turnover in billing and finance hasn't helped the situation and yesterday, US Sprint named its fourth chief financial officer in a year. Scott L. Colabuono, the third GTE executive to head US Sprint's financial operations, will succeed John Crane-Baker as US Sprint's chief financial officer. US Sprint said Mr. Crane-Baker will return to GTE.    Nonetheless, some analysts are enthusiastic about US Sprint, saying that it has become ATandamp;T's most innovative competitor. Losses in the fourth quarter were narrower than expected, said Jack B. Grubman of PaineWebber Inc., and fourth-quarter revenue spurted 27% to $746 million from $589 million a year earlier.    Mr. Grubman predicted US Sprint will post annual revenue of $4 billion in a year, up from the $2.6 billion it reported for 1987. Analysts said, however, they were disappointed with earnings at GTE's local phone companies. GTE said its telephone operating earnings for the year fell 3%, but net earnings rose 2% because GTE is offsetting lower tax rates and lower pension costs with higher depreciation.    GTE shares closed yesterday at $37.625, off 37.5 cents, and United Telecom at $28.875, off 12.5 cents, both in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
