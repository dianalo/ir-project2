McCLAIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal and state regulators say thatcommercial banks, despite record post-Depression failures, are notfalling into a crisis similar to that experienced by the savings andloan industry.   But they told a House Banking financial institutions subcommitteeTuesday they are keeping a wary eye on potential trouble spots,including Third World debts, leveraged buy-out loans, junk bondsfailures and real estate losses.   ``The Bank Insurance Fund is solvent and can meet the obligationsas we foresee them today,'' L. William Seidman, chairman of theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp., testified.   Subcommittee Chairman Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., scheduled threedays of hearings on the state of the bank and credit union insurancesystems in light of the failure of the savings and loan insurancefund and the subsequent congressional authorization of $50 billionto bail out the industry.   At Tuesday's opening session, Annunzio claimed there aresimilarities between the two financial sectors.   ``While thrifts were making bad loans in the United States, bankswere making bad loans all over the world,'' he said. ``While thriftsmade ADC (acquisition, development and construction) loans, banksmade LBO (leveraged buy-out) loans.''   Annunzio pointed to other problems:   _In 1988, the FDIC, which insures individual deposits againstlosses up to $100,000 each, had a net loss of $4.2 billion, itsfirst loss in its 50-year history.   _Two hundred banks failed in 1988.   _Another 1,000 banks are rated as problem institutions.   ``Some observers of the banking industry have suggested thatcommercial banks will soon face a crisis similar to that experiencedby the savings and loan industry,'' Comptroller of the CurrencyRobert L. Clarke testified.   ``In my view, such concerns are overstated and are inconsistentwith observable trends in bank performance,'' he said.   Seidman also noted the bank failures and the cost of assistingtroubled banks but said, ``We believe that the worst of the problemsin the banking industry are behind us.''   ``We expect this year's failure rate to be similar to or slightlybetter than last year and we project the pace of bank failures toslow next year,'' he said.   Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Manuel H. Johnson, noting the largenumber and the size of the failed banks, told the subcommittee therecent problems have demonstrated the strength of the bank insurancefund. But he added:   ``In our view, for the system to remain sound, it must begoverned by an adequate supervisory framework that strikes theproper balance between reasonable prudential rules, such as minimumcapital standards, and an adequate on-site supervision andexamination program.''   Jill M. Considine, chairman of the Conference of State BankSupervisors, also noted the debate over capital standards and saidthey should not be lowered just because thrifts entering the bankinsurance sytstem cannot meet a specified standard.   She also called for a separation of bank chartering and insurancefunctions, saying ``the essential conflict between the proactive,perfomance-oriented goals of the charterer and the risk-adverseattitude of the insurer demands balance.   ``We saw this breakdown in the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,''which until the new savings and loan law was enacted, both charteredand insured thrifts, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
