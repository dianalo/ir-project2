The device is designed for recording 10/sup 15/- 10/sup 20/ eV primary cosmic radiation, mainly by means of electroncomponent of extensive air showers (EAS). Main methodic principle, onwhich the new device is based , is principal inrease (30-50 times), ascompared with other devices, of disposition density of charged particledetectors recording EAS. Considerable increase of detector density inthe given device results in not only accuracy enhancement of ES parameterdetermination but also in considerable increase of statistics of differentenergy EAS recording (from 10/sup 15/ to 10/sup 18/ eV) at high efficiency.</TEXT></DOC>
