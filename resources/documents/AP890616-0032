RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Civil rights activists are accusing the SupremeCourt of ``redneck justice'' and urging Congress to stem what theysay is a reactionary tide threatening 35 years of progress forminorities and women.   The court's ruling Thursday on a racial harassment case is one ofseveral new decisions showing that a newly solidified conservativemajority on the court is intent on carrying out former PresidentRonald Reagan's agenda, civil and women's rights groups say.   The court, by a 5-4 vote, barred the use of a key 1866 civilrights law to fight racial harassment. But the justices votedunanimously to uphold use of the law, originally intended to helpfreed slaves, to sue private individuals for other forms ofdiscrimination.   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,said conservatives on the court ``again revealed themselves to behostile and insensitive to the progress of the last 20 years.Redneck justice meted out with country club manners is no lesspainful than the real thing.''   John Buchanan of the liberal People for the American Way said,``It's a sad commentary on the state of the court's general outlookon civil rights that today's decision must be greeted with a measureof relief.''   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., urged President Bush to joinCongress in proposing bills to reverse the high court rulings.   ``Taken separately, each of these retreats would be a source ofgenuine concern,'' he said. ``Together they are a serious threat tothe 35 years of progress we have achieved toward a better and fairersociety.''   Thursday's ruling follows three other significant high courtsetbacks for those urging more aggressive steps to combat bias.   Last January, the court banned racial quotas in the awarding ofpublic works projects by state and local governments.   On June 5, the justices restricted the use of statisticalevidence to prove an employer illegally relegates minorities orwomen to lower-paying jobs.   And just last Monday, the court significantly expanded the powerof white men to challenge court-approved affirmative action plans,even years after those plans took effect.   Addressing the latest ruling, Julius Chambers of the NAACP LegalDefense and Educational Fund said it means ``employers who do notwant blacks on their work force can simply hire blacks and harassthem on the job until they quit.''   Bruce Fein, a conservative who keeps a close watch on high courtrulings, said civil rights groups were exaggerating the significanceof the decision.   But he agreed that ``there is a conservative five-member majoritynow changing the evaluation and approach to the civil rights law.''   The court acted in the case of Brenda Patterson, a black tellerfor a credit union in North Carolina. She said her boss harassed herby ordering her to do menial tasks, such as sweeping floors.   The court's ruling bars her from suing her employer for big-moneypunitive damages for alleged harassment. It does not prohibit her orothers with similar complaints from suing under a 1964 federal civilrights law that has less sweeping financial remedies.   Also, the 1964 law applies only to businesses with at least 15employees, excluding some 15 percent of the American work force. The1866 law covers all employers.   Writing for the court Thursday, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, thecourt's newest member, denied the court was turning its back onminorities.   ``Neither our words nor our decisions should be interpreted assignaling one inch of retreat from Congress' policy to forbiddiscrimination,'' he said. But he said the court's job is tointerpret the law _ not rewrite it to the liking of civil rightsadvocates.   Kennedy said the 1866 law governs contractual rights _ such ashiring and promotion decisions _ and not other forms of conduct byan employer, including an order to sweep floors.   Justice William J. Brennan, in a dissenting opinion, said, thecourt is engaging in a ``hypertechnical'' reading of the law thatignores its larger purpose.   Joining Kennedy were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist andJustices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Byron R. White.   Kennedy, O'Connor and Scalia are Reagan appointees; Rehnquist waspromoted to chief justice by the former president. White had beenappointed by former President John F. Kennedy.   In a separate decision Thursday, the court said states and stateofficials may not be sued under a related 1871 law that protectscivil liberties. The 5-4 ruling in a case from Michigan said statesand their officials are not ``persons'' as envisioned by the 1871law.</TEXT></DOC>
