Over the past five years, by airline statistics, the number of mechanics at the nation's 10 largest air carriers has increased 35%. But the number of flights has soared 86%. Mechanics at Trans World Airlines, for example, average 12-hour work days, says an official of the machinists union there. &quot;Anyone working such long hours every day is going to experience severe mental fatigue,&quot; contends Charles Bryan, who heads the machinists at Eastern Airlines.    Airline officials, however, insist safety isn't being jeopardized. Some argue that changes in union agreements permit lines to use mechanics more efficiently. The Air Transport Association, a carrier group, says newer planes need less care. If planes were unsafe, increased federal regulatory scrutiny would be forcing aircraft out of service, an industry lobbyist asserts.    The unions accuse the airlines of trying to save money; the carriers see a union push to swell their ranks.    IF HEADHUNTERS picked the president of the United States. . . .    Stephen Garrison of Ward Howell International despairs that the current system puts too much stress on oratorical skills. He would look at leadership capability, depth of knowledge and track record. To Mark Mariaschin of Mariaschin andamp; Co., Washington experience is the most critical requirement. A president must be &quot;trained in the federal bureaucracy,&quot; he says.    Carl Menk of Canny, Bowen Inc. puts intelligence at the top of his list. &quot;If you're not smart, it all stops there,&quot; he declares. He would look also for a good communicator and a strong leader. But the nation's chief executive needn't be a good manager, he insists. A president can bring people aboard to help with that chore, he says.    WE'RE LISTENING, companies tell workers in bid to spur innovative ideas.    Bright suggestions have sometimes been stifled, some firms concede. Mobil Corp.'s exploration and producing unit issues a glossy brochure confessing &quot;we haven't always provided the environment to get the best from our people.&quot; Harbridge House, a consultant, says only a third of the executives it talked to believe their companies are really encouraging innovation.    But more companies have started to hearken. Mobil's brochure aims &quot;to make everybody feel part of a contributing team.&quot; Borden Co. has been dangling cash awards for more than a year. Southwest Airlines gives out prizes ranging from microwaves to mink coats. Ashland Oil Inc. promises recognition. Corning Glass Works has discarded cash rewards as nonproductive; now it says it's getting better ideas by urging workers to join brainstorming teams.    Competitive pressures have forced companies to be more innovative, the American Leadership Forum says.    SAVINGS PROMISED by self-funding health insurance may prove illusory, consultant Mercer-Meidinger-Hansen says. The U.S. Supreme Court has let stand a California tax on the premiums that companies avoid when they pay part of their own medical insurance claims and contract with an insurance company to handle the rest. Texas also imposes a tax.    UNPAID PARENTAL LEAVES of six months are guaranteed to women's outerwear workers in the Northeast under contracts negotiated by manufacturers and the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. More than 100,000 employees, 85% of them women, are covered by the pacts.    CUT STAFF, not raises, seems to be the strategy of New York financial institutions, says consultant Suzanne Minken. Half of the domestic banks surveyed are planning to control costs with job cuts or &quot;flexible&quot; staffing. Not a single one is delaying merit increases, budgeted at 6% this year.    A NURSING SHORTAGE prompts the Franciscan Health System of New Jersey to offer time-and-a-half extra pay, plus an additional vacation week later, to nurses at its two hospitals willing to give up one of their summer vacation weeks. Nurses from other hospitals get double pay for filling in.    THE BATTLE SHIFTS on Ontario law mandating equal pay for equal-value work.    The legislation, which took effect this year, requires most employers in the province -- private as well as public -- to compare job classes dominated by women with those dominated by men. If females are paid less for work considered of equal value, they'll have to get a pay boost. Some other Canadian provinces and U.S. states require pay equity for government employees, but Ontario is the first in North America to extend the reach to private concerns.    The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which represents smaller companies, still fights the law and its implementation. But the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, with larger employers among its members, rejects continued opposition. Though it predicts the measure will mean an immediate 4% payroll rise in the province, the association says it's willing to give the act a year to show its worth.    Ontario's law could be a test for the U.S., says Organization Resources Counselors, asking &quot;Why not elsewhere?&quot;    THE CHECKOFF: Rochester Institute of Technology offers coffee-and-bagel breakfasts to lure part-time students to classes running from 6:20 to 8 a.m. . . . Maybe for speculators planning a plunge, Sharper Image markets an executive diving watch. </TEXT></DOC>
