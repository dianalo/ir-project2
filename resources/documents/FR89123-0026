TheForest Service is replacing its current administrative appeal regulationat 36 CFR 211.18 with two distinct processes for obtaining administrativereview of decisions. One rule, 36 CFR Part 251, Subpart C, is limited toappeal of decisions regarding written instruments authorizing occupancyand use of National Forest System lands, except contracts subject to theContracts Disputes Act, and is available to certain applicants for andholders of such authorizations. The second rule, 36 CFR Part 217, offersany citizen or organization a process for obtaining review of decisionsrelating to land and resource management plans, projects, and activities.The changes result from a comprehensive review of the current rule as requiredby Departmental Regulation 1512-1, consideration of suggestions receivedduring that review from appellants and Forest Service officials, analysisof public comment, and consideration of suggestions from other governmentofficials on the proposed rule as published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 16, 1988 (53 FR 17310). The intended effectof the rule is to simplify the appeal process and to provide appeal proceduresthat are commensurate with the nature and type of decision being disputed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>February 22, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Kathryn C.

During the period Fiscal Years 83 to 85 the Forest Servicereceived an average of 535 appeals per year, of which 235 reached the officeof the Chief for review. In FY 88, 1,609 appeals were received of which508 were directed to the Chief. Most of the latter, 306 in number, wereappeals relating to the approval of Forest level land and resource managementplans prepared under the provisions of the National Forest Management Actof 1976 (NFMA), and its implementing regulation at 36 CFR Part 219. Relativelyfew initial decisions of the Chief are appealed to the Secretary, only10 during FY 88. Review officials are guided in the appeal process by 36CFR 211.18, and by Forest Service policy and procedures as set forth inthe Forest Service Manual (FSM 1570) and accompanying Handbook (FSH 1509.12).<ITAG tagnum="84">Introduction</ITAG>There is no statutory requirement that the Forest Service provide a grievanceor appeal procedure. Rather, at its own discretion and initiative, theagency, since 1906, has provided some kind of process by which permitteesand the general public could challenge forest officer decisions. In fact,until the enactment of several environmental statutes in the 1960's and70's, the appeal process was about the only formal mechanism the publiccould utilize to influence agency decisionmaking. Appeal procedures werefirst codified in 1936 (1 CFR Part 1092, August 15, 1936). During the interveninghalf century, the Forest Service has periodically revised the appeal regulationsresponding to changing law and policy, and to its own experiences underthe procedures existing at the time. During this period, the rules haveshifted alternatively back and forth from informal to formal in nature,and from wholly internal administrative review to review and adjudicationby independent boards.Since 1965 the appeal regulation has been revised three times, the latestin 1982 after the agency conducted a major review of the then current regulation(36 CFR 211.19 promulgated in 1977) to comply with Executive Order (EO)12044, the first EO to require review of existing regulations on a 5-yearcycle. The result was a revised appeal procedure at 36 CFR 211.18 (48 FR13425, March 31, 1983), the current rule.The Forest Service announced its decision to review the current appealregulation in the Semi-Annual Regulatory Agenda published April 27, 1987(52 FR 14144). On May 20, 1987, the agency issued a press release announcingthe impending review, and informed the public that their comments wouldbe solicited. Subsequently, on June 11, 1987, a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice (52 FR 22348) was published seeking publicinput about how well the current appeal process meets public needs, islikely to do so in the future, and what people like and dislike about theprocess. Additionally, the Forest Service issued 928 letters inviting publiccomment, and conducted 106 interviews with various line and staff officersthroughout the agency.The review revealed that the appeals process has served the agency andthe public with varying degrees of success for many years. However, theprocess as it has evolved during the last few years is not the simple,quick, informal process that the agency originally intended it to be. Instead,it has become a significant generator of paperwork and a time-consuming,procedurally onerous, and costly effort, trading off resources and energiesthat otherwise might be directed to substantive on-the-ground resourcemanagement needs. Based on these findings, the Forest Service concludedthat the appeals process needed adjustment to better serve the public andthe agency. Accordingly, the agency published proposed rules revising theappeal procedure in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 16, 1988 (53 FR 17310).<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Public Comment </ITAG>In addition to publishing the proposed rules in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the Forest Service mailed 21,426 letters toknown interested parties inviting comment on the rule. Also, agency personnelconducted 193 briefings for groups around the country. In response to theseefforts, the Forest Service received 921 letters postmarked on or beforethe July 15 end-of-comment period, and more than 100 late responses, allof which were considered. Eighteen different types of respondents, as shownbelow, provided input:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s100,10</C> <H1>Respondent</H1><H1>Number of Letters</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Federal agencies, excluding FS<D>5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">State agencies<D>16</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">City/Municipal government<D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Federal elected officials<D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">State elected officials<D>3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">County elected officials<D>6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">City elected officials<D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Indian tribal councils<D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Professional societies<D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Conservation/environmental/preservation organizations<D>127</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Civic groups<D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Businesses/business groups<D>23</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Timber industry organizations<D>55</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Associations and unions<D>41</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Riding and hiking interests<D>5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hunting and sports groups<D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Other organizations<D>6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Individuals and families<D>614</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total timely respondents<D>921</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total untimely respondents<D>104</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="5">Total</ITAG><D>1025</D></ITAG> Many letters seemed campaign inspired, using similar or identical languageto identify and describe respondents' respective interests or concerns,frequently referring to or referencing other respondents' statements andincluding them as enclosures. While there was a great deal of common informationnoticeable in these letters, much of this shared information was erroneousor misleading. The result was considerable comment based on misunderstanding,an indication some respondents were not well apprised about the rule itselfor the preamble which presented the rationale behind the proposals. However,many of the comments received were well-informed, constructive, and well-written.Comments substantially focused on the informal decision review processproposed for 36 CFR Part 217. These comments centered on 11 major areasof concern, constituting more than three-quarters of the total comment.These areas were: purpose and scope, notice of decision, appealable/nonappealabledecisions, levels of review, filing procedures/time extensions, responsivestatements, stays, open/closed communications, intervention, oral presentations,and filing fees. After the public comment period closed, and prior to the drafting of thisfinal rule, the Subcommittee on Family Farms, Forests and Energy, of theHouse Committee on Agriculture, held an oversight hearing on the proposedrule. In addition, the staff of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition,and Forestry requested a briefing. The suggestions that arose from thehearing and briefing, along with the public comment received on the proposedrule, whether timely or late, were reviewed and have been fully consideredin preparation of these final rules.Responses received are available for review at the office of the StaffAssistant for Operations, National Forest System, Forest Service, USDA,Room 4211, South Agriculture Building, 14th and Independence Avenues SW.,Washington, DC 20013, telephone (202) 382-9349.<ITAG tagnum="84">General comments</ITAG>As proposed, two separate processes would be created, geared to the typeof decision at issue. One process, to be codified at 36 CFR Part 251, providesfor appealing decisions when the appeal is a legally-based grievance arisingfrom a past action that may be affected by the current and disputed decision.This appeal process would afford instrument holders or applicants a degreeof process appropriate to the specific nature of their legal, business-type,relationship with the agency.The second appeal process, to be codified at 36 CFR Part 217, involvesdecisions made during the planning and decisionmaking process and documentedaccording to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and NationalForest Management Act (NEMA) implementing instructions. It affords interestedindividuals and organizations who do not have a business-type relationshipwith the agency one more opportunity, following and in addition to theirinput during the planning process, to seek agency oversight and reconsiderationat a higher level. It emphasizes public participation features currentlyfound in planning and decisionmaking for future actions.In addition to comments on specific sections of the proposed rules, manyrespondents expressed concern that: (1) Rights of appeal to which the publicis legally entitled are being curtailed; and (2) the public is being dividedinto two classes, with some of the public relegated to second class status,with attendant diminution of legal rights.In the first instance, many respondents believed any agency appeal regulationmust afford the procedural rights of due process guaranteed by the FifthAmendment of the Constitution that are required when property rights areaffected. Other respondents believed that the appeal regulation must containall the features of a formal Administrative Procedure Act (APA) process,including a formalized hearing procedure, an impartial judge, and provisionfor building a record. Some also believed that the appeal regulation isa right specifically provided by statute. There was support expressed for``streamlining'' the process, but not to the extent of eliminating featuresconsidered to constitute due process (such as responsive statements andconsequent replies, intervention, and oral presentations).In the second instance, respondents' concerns about the rules creatingtwo unequal classes of appellants centered on the perceived reduction ofinput opportunities for those using 36 CFR Part 217 procedures, althoughsome respondents also felt that 36 CFR Part 251 eliminated input opportunitiesas well. Those who do not have a legal relationship with the Forest Servicedo not see the legal relationship as an adequate basis for modifying thekind of ``access to process'' necessary for review of management decisions.<T3>Response: </T3>Respondents who urged that the APA must be followedfailed to grasp the distinction between the types of due process intendedby that Act. When an appeal procedure is mandated by statute, then specific,formalized elements of due process detailed in the APA must be applied.When an appeal procedure is not mandated by statute, but rather providedvoluntarily by an agency, as this one is, then only the broad principlesof the APA apply. In other words, the procedures made available by theAPA for notice and opportunity to be heard must be applied fairly. Anyprocess voluntarily deemed as ``due'' must then be followed by the agencywhich institutes it.The procedures being adopted are based on the type of decision that hasbeen made, and the type of relationship that exists between parties tothe decision and the agency. The rules are not based on a concept thata certain class or party should have more or less access to a process forhaving a decision reviewed. This fundamental concept on which the two rulesare based was thoroughly discussed in the supplementary information tothe proposed rule, and is not presented again in this response (53 FR 17310).See Comment and Response under andSection; 217.1 for further discussion.<T3>Comment: </T3>The proposed rule provoked considerable general comment,largely critical, on the relationship between the Forest Service and thepublic. The public's concerns in this area can be described in three categories:(1) Those indicating that the proposed changes limit public input in thedecision-making process; (2) arguments that public involvement prior tothe decision should not preclude a readily available means to protest thedecision; and (3) those reflecting a feeling that the Forest Service wasoperating in bad faith.Comments from those expressing concern that the Forest Service was limitingpublic input were often phrased to indicate that the public sees the appealsprocess as one facet of public involvement. There are a substantial numberof people who feel that by tightening the appeals rules, the Forest Serviceis trying to close a legitimate avenue of involvement.The second group of respondents see appeals as a separate category fromother kinds of public involvement, but feel that public involvement priorto decision making is not a basis to preclude redress through appeal. Severalargued that, had public involvement been operating as envisioned underthe National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and NFMA, the flood of planning-relatedappeals that have been so slow to resolve would never have occurred.The third group of respondents reacted to the proposed changes more broadlyin terms of trust. Comments in this category expressed distrust of theagency's decisionmaking. Some of these respondents described the agencyas corrupt, deserving suspicion, hypocritical, or biased toward the timberindustry.<T3>Response: </T3>We agree that the appeals process can be viewed as afacet or type of public involvement, but appeals are a very limited meansof public involvement compared to the public's opportunity to provide inputin the predecisional stages. Not all the public is involved through anappeal to influence the disputed decisions; only appellants and intervenorsare. The rest of the public very seldom become involved after an appealis filed.The Forest Service does not seek through the revised procedures to limitpublic involvement in decisionmaking. To the contrary, the rules emphasizepublic involvement prior to a decision being made, and provisions are incorporatedinto the rules that create explicit opportunities for conflict resolutionbefore a decision is implemented and while a decision is being reviewed.Additionally, the final rule at 36 CFR Part 217 restores intervention asa procedural process users have been accustomed to in the past.Nevertheless, we believe that public participation and involvement in planningand decisionmaking is more effective prior to making the actual decisionthan afterwards, if for no other reason than more people participate. However,public involvement prior to making a decision should not limit access toa decision review process, and we had no intent to do so. Having a decisionreview process is actually an incentive for the agency to commit to publicinvolvement prior to making decisions.The ``trust'' and ``bad faith'' comments are legitimate, if troubling,expressions of public concern. In releasing the proposed rules, the ForestService went on record to say that the agency sincerely wants to make betterdecisions and involve the public more effectively and to improve its performancein handling appeals. The agency has every intention of doing this and hopesthat all its constituent publics will monitor our performance and thushelp the agency earn public trust.The above three categories of comment are also responded to in the discussionof specific sections of 36 CFR Part 217, since many respondents broughtup similar concerns and targeted them at specific sections.<ITAG tagnum="84">Oral Presentations</ITAG>The proposed rules at Part 217 would eliminate the oral presentation procedure,but it emphasizes the authority of the Deciding and Reviewing Officersto discuss issues with requesters and others, and to hold meetings. Currently,appeallants and intervenors must request an oral presentation when theyfile their notice of appeal/request for intervention; if granted, it isusually held after the record is received by the Reviewing Officer.<T3>Comments: </T3>A few respondents supported the elimination of oralpresentations, but those who did gave no reasons for their support, theysimply listed a number of features that they favored.Those who opposed the proposed change described the advantages of oralpresentations, including the following: Communicates in a way that is impossibleto achieve on paper; clarifies issues and positions; permits ``give andtake'' between the parties; helps verify the sincerity of each party'sbeliefs; gets at the ``heart'' of the appeal; enchances dialogue leadingto resolution of disagreements; permits viewing physical evidence; andreduces angry feelings triggered by reading the impersonal documents.Several comments noted the dual standard which allows oral presentationsunder Part 251, but not under Part 217.Some respondents said that the lack of oral presentations will lead tomore litigation because fewer appeals will be settled to appellants' satisfaction.Others feared that flawed decisions would result from eliminating communicationswith appellants such as responsive statements and oral presentations afford.And, one respondent was disappointed with the apparent lack of ``openness''signaled by the rule; while another feared that the change signifies theelimination of all public involvement meetings.One claimed the oral presentation is ``less time consuming'' than extractinginformation ``from the review file.''<T3>Response: </T3>Opportunities for and references to more openness, directcontact between Deciding Officers and participants, and resolution of issuesduring a review abound in the proposal and are explained in the preamblediscussion.While the formal feature of oral presentations permitted under the currentrule would be eliminated under Part 217, the proposed process featuresand promotes options for informal meetings and discussions. In addition,the final rule includes a new provision that any of the parties may requestsuch meetings at any time during the appeal. The benefits of what is calledan ``oral presentation'' under the current rule still accrue to everyoneinvolved. Consequently, the final rule regarding oral presentations, remainsas proposed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Filing Fees</ITAG>For the reasons stated in the supplementary information to the proposedrule (53 FR 17314), a requirement for filing fees was not included in theproposed rules. However, public comment was solicited on the possibilityof imposing filing fees, because the fee idea as a requisite part of theappeals process is a recurring one. The increased number of appeals filedduring the past year or two leads many observers to believe that the administrativeappeals process provided under 36 CFR 211.18 is being abused by groupsand individuals to disrupt resource programs, especially timber sale andharvest in some areas of the country. In response, many groups and individualshave proposed that a significant filing fee be imposed to cover the costof processing an appeal, a strategy designed to prevent ``frivolous'' appeals.<T3>Comments: </T3>Public comment on the filing fee idea was 3 to 1 opposed.Most respondents felt that imposing fees of any sort would be counter tothe historical objectives of the Department and the Forest Service in providingthe public an open, informal administrative appeals process. Additionally,they thought that it would be costly to taxpayers, and only result in furthercomplicating the appeals process. A few respondents questioned whetherthe agency has statutory authority to require a fee as a condition of filingan appeal if the objective is to recover costs. Others felt that fees,whether to recover costs or a modest filing charge, would discriminateagainst parties not able to afford the charges, and thus give rise to somesort of waiver policy. Some respondents cited beliefs that filing feesshould be unnecessary, given the thrust of the revised rules to make betterdecisions earlier so that sufficient time is available for appeal reviewwithout holding activities such as timber sales and subsequent harvestsin abeyance. Supporters of filing fees generally cited a need for a mechanismto combat, from their perspective, the ``frivolous'' appeals that delayresource activities, particularly the sale and harvest of timber from manyNational Forest areas. Other respondents also suggested that a bond berequired where an economic hardship on a third party would be created bya decision to stay implementation of a project or activity.<T3>Response: </T3>Public comment about imposing filing fees can be dividedinto two areas of concern, one dealing with policy considerations, theother with legal authorities. The following discussion examines the implicationsof these concerns and serves as the basis for the decision not to includefiling fees as a requisite part of the administrative appeal processesestablished in this final rulemaking.1. <T3>Possible impact on NEPA procedures. </T3>The Forest Service administrativeappeal regulation is closely linked to fulfillment of public notice andopportunity to comment requirements of the NEPA implementing regulations(40 CFR 1506.10). Under the NEPA regulations, the Forest Service has beenpermitted to issue decision documents along with the environmental disclosuredocuments because the administrative appeal procedure gives the publicopportunity to challenge a decision. The likelihood that filing fees coulddiscourage use of the appeal process calls to question whether the ForestService could continue to issue environmental disclosure and decision documentssimultaneously.2. <T3>Impact of substantial fees. </T3>Historically, the Forest Service hasinvited and encouraged public use of the administrative appeal process,consciously and successfully developing a public expectation that it mayfreely gain access to decisionmakers through the appeals process. The processhas served well, albeit slowly at times, as a policy review mechanism totest and adjust agency direction. Substantial fees would operate to discourageappeals; as a result, the policy review mechanism would lose effectivenesswith any decline in use of the process.In defending agency action, government counsel often argue in litigationthat plaintiffs must first exhaust their administrative remedies. Imposingsubstantial fees could lead to more direct filings in Federal DistrictCourts, thus depriving the agency of opportunity to review and documentits decision (through administrative appeal proceedings to show rationaldecisionmaking) prior to litigation. Imposing a substantial fee would alsolikely promote requests for a fee waiver procedure process (similar toFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) situations) and further complicate theadministrative appeal process.High fees also would tend to discriminate against individuals rather thanorganizations. While any nominal fee would discourage appeals by individualswho file non-specific appeals on numerous projects, imposing fees onlyfor the purpose of limiting appeals affects all potential appellants withoutregard to subject matter or merit. As a matter of policy, other alternativesto limit the negative effects of appeals could be more effective, as forexample, simplified processing, faster reviews, as well as improved publicinvolvement prior to the decision.3. <T3>Inconsistency of fees with simpler, streamlined review process. </T3>Initiatingsubstantial fees would seem inconsistent with amending the existing appealprocess for simplicity. The proposed regulation, 36 CFR Part 217, modifiesexisting administrative appeal features appellants have come to rely onor view as ``due process protections.'' If the agency imposes substantialfees, appellants will expect more ``due process'' protections, such asright to confront and interrogate witnesses, right to several levels ofappeal, right to responsive statements, etc.Once an appellant has invested a substantial filing fee, settlement forless than complete relief may be less likely, and the tendency to litigatean adverse and costly appeal decision will likely increase.4. <T3>Statutory authority for fees. </T3>There is no specific statutory authorityfor the Forest Service to require a fee as a condition for filing an appeal.However, the Independent Offices Appropriation Act, as revised (31 U.S.C.9701 (1986)) might be considered authority for a reasonable fee. Underthis Act, such charge is to be fair and based on the cost to the government,the value of the service, public policy or interest served, and other relevantfacts. The agency has invited the public to utilize the appeals process,so it may be questionable whether its use by the public is a ``service''to the public as contemplated by the Act.A fee of $1,000, as proposed by some respondents, would probably exceedthe scope of the Act, and would be far beyond fees imposed upon privateparties by Federal District Courts ($120), U.S. Claims Court ($60), andFederal Circuit Courts ($100). Federal court fees are not based on costsof service, but on separate statutory authority to collect fees. However,these courts may award damages, costs, and attorney fees in favor of successfulparties. It would appear that specific statutory authority for filing feesis needed so that substantial, high fees could be insulated from seriousjudicial scrutiny.Other formal administrative bodies within the Department of Agriculture,such as the Agriculture Board of Contract Appeals, and the Judicial Officewhich holds all formal APA hearings for the Department, impose no filingfees or require bonds. Neither are fees imposed in the ``protest'' procedurefor certain decisions involving land and resource management plans of theBureau of Land Management, Department of the Interior. Moreover, limitingfees to only certain types of activity, such as timber sale and relatedharvest activity, might be deemed arbitrary and capricious.5. <T3>Fees based on cost recovery vs. minimum filing fee.</T3> The ForestService appeals workload nearly doubled from 874 cases in FY 87 to 1,609cases in FY 88. No cost breakdown is available for 1988, but for the previous2 years, direct costs to process appeals during those years averaged $5,304,952,or about $5,424 per case. Facing this situation, fees based on cost recoverywould place the administrative appeal process beyond the reach of mostindividuals and small organizations, and thus undermine the basis for havingan appeal process. A fee collection program involving a nominal fee foradministrative appeals, based on other experiences in fee collection activitieselsewhere in the agency, would cost about $35 per appeal. For 1988, thiswould have amounted to only $56,315. The administrative burden of collectingfees would not be worth the small amount collected. Therefore, for thereasons set forth, the final rule does not include provisions for fee collectionin either 36 CFR Part 217 or 251.<ITAG tagnum="84">Specific comments </ITAG>The following summarizes the major comments and suggestions received onthe proposed revision of 36 CFR Part 217, and the Department's responseto these comments. Although reviewers were asked to key their commentsto specific sections, the majority did not respond in this manner. Also,many comments embodied multiple sections. Where this is the case, our responseto the public comment similarly embodies multiple sections. Many respondentspointed out that the proposed rule was hard to follow. Thus, the finalrule has been rearranged to more closely follow the steps in the processand many of the headings have been retitled to better describe their contents.However, the publics' comments and our responses are keyed to the sectionnumbers and headings of the proposed rule document.Section 217.1 Purpose and scope. This section stipulated that this is an informal review process and istied to the NEPA process. Only decisions documented as a consequence ofagency compliance with NEPA procedures are reviewable under this rule.The proposed rule emphasized public participation and dispute resolution,and deemphasized process and procedures. <T3>Comments: </T3>Some respondents thought that making two rules out ofthe current one rule was unfair because due process aspects retained in36 CFR Part 251 are not provided for in 36 CFR Part 217. These respondentsfelt that they are just as entitled to due process in Part 217 as are permitholders under Part 251. They also commented that decisions under 36 CFRPart 251, specifically timber and mining activities, affect more than justthe permit holder and should be appealable by other interested and affectedparties. <T3>Response: </T3>Some misinformation persists concerning what would bereviewable under Part 217 versus what would be appealable under Part 251.Decisions concerning mining activities authorized by appropriate writteninstruments are not confined exclusively to Part 251 as some respondentsthought. If such activities involve environmental analysis and documentationprior to a decision to issue or modify an authorization, review of thedecision would be available under 36 CFR Part 217. As is currently thecase, disputes between the Forest Service and a timber purchaser arisingfrom administration of a timber sale contract will continue to be administeredunder 7 CFR Part 24, the Contract Disputes Act. Those respondents who feel they have the same rights to due process asholders of written instruments issued by the Forest Service need to understandbetter the fundamental basis on which the two-rule process was developedand proposed. Elements of due process are incorporated in the Part 251regulations because of the legal and business relationship involved betweenthe holder of the written instrument and the Forest Service. As noted inthe preamble to the proposed rule, this relationship does not exist betweenthe Forest Service and individuals and groups who disagree with a resourceallocation or management decision. Therefore, it is not believed necessaryto provide the same degree of due process as provided in Part 251 for appealinga management decision under Part 217. Moreover, the publics who wish todispute a management decision under Part 217 do not have a legal rightto administrative appeal. They do have a legal right to timely notice ofa decision, but access to an appeals process and the right to be heardin a prompt, objective review of the decision are provided at the administrativediscretion of the Forest Service. This Department does not believe it is in the best interests of NationalForest System management or public policy to disrupt or delay managementactivities over long periods of time. It is in the public's interest tohave a timely mechanism for reviewing decisions and either abandoning themanagement action or proceeding to implementation. Therefore, the final rule retains two separate rules, emphasizes the multipleopportunities prior to review of a decision for the public to influencedecisionmaking, and points out the role of constructive dialogue betweenparticipants during the review. However, in recognition of the public comment,some elements of due process in 36 CFR Part 251 have been incorporatedinto the final rule at 36 CFR Part 217. These are intervention and additionalstay procedures. These are discussed under andSection;andSection; 217.4 and217.12 of this preamble.Section 217.2 Applicability and effective date. This section would allow for the continuance of appeals that have alreadybeen filed under the current rules at 36 CFR 211.16, 211.18, 228.14, and292.15. No comments were received on this section. Therefore, this sectionis retained as proposed but it is recoded as andSection; 217.19.Section 217.3 Definitions and terminology. This section provided definitions for the terms used in the rule. <T3>Comments: </T3>The only comment received on this section was from sevenrespondents who objected to the words ``request'' and ``requester,'' statingit was confusing and appeared to set up a class distinction. <T3>Response: </T3>It was not the intent of this rule to set up a classdistinction. The intent in using the words ``request'' and ``requester''was to make a distinction between the more formal procedures in 36 CFRPart 251 and the simpler review process of Part 217. However, because respondentsfound these words confusing, the final rule restores the currently utilizedterms of ``appeal,'' ``appellant,'' and ``intervenor.'' This section hasbeen modified to reflect this change and conforming amendments are madeelsewhere in the rule for consistency throughout the rule. This sectionis recoded in the final rule as andSection; 217.2.Section 217.4 Eligible participants. The proposed rule established a review process accessible to a virtuallyunlimited range of interests. The only limitation was that Federal entities,as well as Forest Service employees, would be excluded from participationin this review process. Under the current rule, anyone can request to intervene at any time duringthe process. The proposed rule eliminated intervention as a formal processbut provided for accepting written comments into the review file from anyinterested person or organization. <T3>Comments: </T3>The respondents to this section represented two pointsof view. One concerned exempting Federal organizations and Forest Serviceemployees from using this rule. These respondents pointed to the possibleneed for Federal organizations to have access to this review process asan alternative to existing issue-resolution mechanisms that might proveunproductive in occasional instances. Some respondents also believed thata Forest Service employee who has a private property interest in land impactedby a management decision should be able to request a review under thisrule. The other view concerned intervention. The majority of these respondentsfelt they have a ``right'' to intervene as they have been accustomed tounder 36 CFR 211.18. Consequently, they want that ``right'' retained. However,some respondents added the recommendation that time delays to permit interventionshould not be permitted.<T3>Response: </T3>Means for resolving disagreements between Federal agenciesconcerning proposed major Federal actions that might cause unsatisfactoryenvironmental effects are available through the Council on EnvironmentalQuality (CEQ) (40 CFR Part 1504). Moreover, Federal agencies have informalmechanisms through their agency heads to bring their concerns to the attentionof the Forest Service. No purpose would be served by providing agenciesan additional administrative process to challenge decisions. Therefore,the final rule retains the exclusion. Forest Service employees having a private property interest in land subjectto impact from a management decision would have access to appeal under36 CFR Part 251. Therefore, the final rule retains the exclusion of employeesfrom challenges to management decisions. In the proposed rule, the Forest Service viewed intervention as a structuredprocess for involvement when rights have to be protected, e.g., rightsof parties that may be injured by an appeal decision. However, injury wasnot the focus of proposed 36 CFR Part 217. Rather, it was designed to reviewinformation developed through National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)and National Forest Management Act (NFMA) planning activities and attendantpublic participation. The intent of 36 CFR Part 217 was to provide an optionalfinal step, through appeal, in this decisionmaking process to review thekind and quality of information in the environmental documentation, includingthe decision itself. If that information is inadequate for a ReviewingOfficer to substantiate the decision, the decision would likely not standon review. The agency welcomes all forms of information germane to thedecision and its supporting documentation. But, formal intervention aspracticed under the current appeal rule and retained under the proposedrule for Part 251 was not considered appropriate to this information assessmentstep, anymore than it is considered suitable as a structured mechanismduring the earlier steps in the planning and decisionmaking process. Theagency continues to believe that providing all the ``formal'' embellishmentsof intervention is unnecessary and counterproductive to achieving the initialgoals of offering a separate, less formal process for review of managementdecisions. However, having considered the public comment which strongly favored retentionof intervention, the final rule provides for a simpler form of interventionthan does the current rule or in Part 251. Under the final rules at Part217, intervention will be granted if requested within the time period provided,intervenors can provide comments on issues raised in the notice of appeal,have the right to receive and comment on additional information requestedby the Reviewing Officer, and can participate in resolution meetings. Unlikethe current appeal rules, intervenors under Part 217 cannot intervene atany time, request a stay, or continue an appeal if the appellants withdrawan appeal. The agency believes that this form of intervention both meetsthe concerns of those who were concerned about the loss of stature in andaccess to the appeals process and still contributes achieving an unarrayed,less formal review procedure, a major objective of this rulemaking process.A new section coded andSection; 217.14 and titled ``Intervention'' addressesthis change. Because intervention will be permitted, there is no need toprovide for written comments by other individuals. Therefore, the provisionhas been deleted in the final rule. In addition, in the final rule, thesection entitled ``Eligible participants'' is recoded and retitled andSection;217.6 Participants.Section 217.5 Obtaining notice of decision. The proposed rule required notice only through publishing a legal noticein a newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the decision,and notice of certain other decisions in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The review period would begin with the dateof publication. <T3>Comments: </T3>A common perception by respondents was that notice inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>or a newspaper would replace the current practiceof mailing a Decision Notice or Record of Decision to interested and affectedpersons. Respondents felt that anyone who had expressed interest in thedecision should be notified in writing. Respondents mentioned the drawbacksof <T4>Federal Register </T4>notification, such as being time-consuming, notreadily available to the general public, and expensive. Problems associatedwith newspaper notification included: The definition of general distribution;local people do not usually subscribe to regional papers; people outsidethe circulation area of a local newspaper would not have ready access tothe notice; delays in notice because local rural newspapers are often weekly;Forests are often served by several newspapers. <T3>Response: </T3>Motives for specifying legal notices were misinterpretedas trying to maintain secrecy, attempting to rush implementation of controversialprojects, and reducing the ability of the general public to appeal decisions.The legal notice requirement was intended to be an <T3>addition </T3>to the notice requirements specified by the Council onEnvironmental Quality (CEQ) at 40 CFR 1506.6. And, the date of the publishednotice was intended to signify the start of the review period. Because of this misunderstanding, this section has been rewritten to includecommon practice currently observed by the agency, applied to all decisionsappealed under this rule. The rule also requries that <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice will be given on decisions that are consideredto have effects of National concern, and appealable decisions made by theChief. The requirement for legal notice has been made discretionary becauseit presented more problems than solutions. The appeal period will starton the day following when the decision document is signed and dated, asis currently the practice. Additionally, the final rule specifies thatthe decision will be mailed promptly so that those wishing to utilize theprocess will have the maximum time available to them. This section has been retitled Giving notice of decisions subject to appeal.Section 217.6 Decisions subject to review and Section 217.7 Decisions notsubject to review. Part 217 proposed a review process applicable to all decisions arisingfrom a NEPA evaluation, and documented in a Record of Decision, DecisionNotice, or Decision Memo. It excluded all other decisions plus a list ofexclusions similar to the current rule. Further, the proposal excludedcatastrophic events from review when the Chief or Regional Forester believesit critical to move quickly with rehabilitation or salvage and publishesan exclusion to this effect in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> <T3>Comments: </T3>The majority of the comments dealt with these two sectionsas one subject; thus, we are responding in a similar manner. Some respondents suggested that a proposed action should be appealableonly on the basis that it is inconsistent with the Forest plan, thus narrowingthe scope of review. Other respondents wanted a broader definition of whatshould be availlable for decision review. They saw the narrowing of theprocess as restricting citizen oversight of decisions affecting NationalForest management because administrative, policy, and procedural decisionsare not covered by this review process. There was some concern voiced regardingwhich regulation (36 CFR Part 217 or 36 CFR Part 251) would apply for certaindecisions and whether the Forest Service or the requester/appellant wouldmake the choice. Many respondents said decisions on catastrophic events should not be excludedfrom review. They said the Forest Service would abuse the definition andslip in other things besides these natural events. <T3>Response: </T3>Currently, appeal of rehabilitation activity decisionsare covered by an interim rule at 36 CFR 211.16. Folding the broad provisionsof this rule into the final rule eliminates a separate rule, but it retainsthe opportunity for the public to request review of decisions concerningrehabilitation activities unless the Chief or the Regional Forester, becauseof severity and time lines, makes a decision to exclude them, and publishesa notice to this effect in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>The notion for narrowing the scope of review to only whether a proposedaction is in conformance with the Forest plan has a defect. First, somesort of review would be needed to determine whether the disputed actionconformed to the Forest plan. We expect most actions would. What's criticallyimportant is: Does the decision to undertake the disputed action meet NEPArequirements? The action might conform to the plan but not NEPA. Therefore,the proposed action should not proceed until it is in compliance with boththe Forest plan and NEPA. Thus, the final rule does not narrow the scopeof review. Policy-type administrative decisions were not included in the review processbecause they determine how the agency is to approach a task or situation.These policy decisions seldom require documentation of environmental impacts.Under the current rule, policy or procedural decisions have constitutedonly a miniscule proportion of appeals received. Other administrative avenuesare open to the public to influence decisionmaking of this kind, and torequest reconsideration, which would be more efficient than utilizing theappeal process. For example, many Forest Service policies and proceduresare published in the Federal Register for comment. Additionally, noticeof such comment opportunities is mailed to interested and affected personsand often also announced through press releases. There was never any intent that the Forest Service would choose which rulewould be applicable to a particular decision. The choice is up to the appellantto make. Each new rule, 36 CFR Part 217 and 36 CFR Part 251, clearly defineswhich kind of decision is covered by which rule. The final rule retains the proposed inclusions and exclusions, but thesections are recoded and retitled andSection; 217.3 Decisions subject toappeal and andSection; 217.4 Decisions not subject to appeal. Section 217.8 Levels of review available. Under the proposed rule change, a second level of review was a discretionarydecision by the Reviewing Officer at that level. <T3>Comments: </T3>Many respondents objected to the concept of a one-levelreview process because: they felt it was designed for agency expediencyat the individual's expense; it vested an inappropriate amount of powerin one person; it did nothing to encourage or promote negotiated settlements;and it would lead to cursory and superficial review. And, while reducingthe number of appeals, respondents saw the one level review as increasingthe potential for more litigation. The major concerns about the one-level review centered on District Rangerdecisions. Respondents focused on the Forest Supervisor as final reviewingofficer, doubting that the review could be objective because the projector activity (action) being appealed was in keeping with goals establishedby the Forest Supervisor and may have been undertaken with advice and supervisionfrom the Supervisor's level. The second area of concern over the one-level review process centered onconcerns that the current second level was a vehicle to make upper levelsof the Forest Service aware of local issues which have possible regionalor national implications. Many respondents felt that the second reviewwas also a chance to be heard by those who had a broader perspective ofForest Service policy and national issues; that it was a chance for theChief to clarify policy to the field; and it was seen as a chance to makenational organizations aware of local concerns. Many found the idea of discretionary review unsatisfactory for a varietyof reasons. There was concern that without specified decision criteriathere would not be a fair way to determine if a second level was needed.Several respondents stated they felt they should automatically receivea second review. And some respondents stated that public controversy shouldbe a reason for second review. Considerable concern was expressed that the 15-day period to exercise discretionwas insufficient, and that the 30-day second level review period wouldnot permit adequate consideration, thereby causing the lower decision tostand by default. <T3>Response: </T3>Although there were numerous comments on the need fortwo levels, the one-level review with discretionary review at the secondlevel best fits the intent of the rule. It simplifies the process, improvesthe potential to process appeals in a timely manner, yet retains the optionfor a second review. Inherent in the process is the requirement for fulland proper use of the NEPA process. The NEPA process requires Federal agenciesto involve the public early and continuously throughout the decisionmakingprocess; thus a fair and open hearing on issues related to a decision areavailable. Lastly, the intent of the rule is dispute resolution by establishingstronger ties between the initial decisionmaker and the public, all inthe overall interest of making better National Forest management decisions.The public perceived the relationship between the Forest Supervisor andthe District Ranger as being so close as to prevent an objective reviewof Ranger decisions by Forest Supervisors. Even though 82 percent of theDistrict Ranger decisions currently appealed are resolved without a secondlevel appeal, the final rule provides for a two-level appeal process fordecisions made at the District Ranger level. However, second level reviewof a Ranger decision by the Regional Forester will not be automatic. Itwill have to be requested, and the review will be based solely on the existingrecord without additional submissions. The second level appeal decisionwill not receive further review. In the final rule, a new paragraph (d) was added to clarify that ForestSupervisor's dismissal decisions are subject only to discretionary review,not to a second level appeal. This section is recoded as andSection; 217.7. The provisions detailing howdiscretionary review will work have been moved to a new section, andSection;217.17 Discretionary review, bringing into one place all references todiscretionary review. In the proposed rule, these references were foundin andSection;andSection; 217.8, 217.13, 217.14, and 217.15. For response toadditional comments on discretionary review see the discussion under andSection;217.15 Review decision. Section 217.9 Filing procedures and timeliness; Section 217.10 Extensionof time; Section 217.11 Content of a request for review. The proposed rule eliminated the discretionary extension of time for filinga Statement of Reasons, while maintaining extension options for all ForestService deadlines, except at the discretionary review level. The proposalrequired that the Statement of Reasons material be filed with the Requestfor Review. And, it included very specific direction on what must be included.<T3>Comments:</T3> Public responses tended to link these three sectionstogether. Many respondents felt that preparation of an appeal, includingthe complete statement of reasons, in the allotted 45 days could not beaccomplished, and recommended provisions for extensions. Some claimed thatthe Forest Service was biased against individuals and volunteer organizationswhich would be working nights and weekends to provide the analysis, andbe less likely to meet the 45-day limit than organizations which have paidstaff. Several pointed out that extensions are needed in order to requestand obtain needed data from the Forest Service. Others mentioned that,although they had been involved in the development of major projects, theEnvironmental Impact Statement preferred alternatives often change betweendraft and final, and that an entirely new review and analysis opportunityis therefore needed. Many pointed out that the proposed rules allow theForest Service to grant itself extensions, and felt this was unfair, sincethe agency holds all the information and should be the best prepared tomeet timeliness. Respondents mentioned that Forest Service failures tomeet timelines under the current process are causing significant projectdelays and that the proposed rule perpetuates this situation. <T3>Response:</T3> While this rule emphasizes dispute resolution, it isnot intended to take the place of early and continuous public participationin the agency's NEPA-based planning and decisionmaking process. If thepublic is concerned about National Forest management matters, it has aresponsibility to work with responsible officials in the development ofvarious environmental documents prior to decisions being made that aresubject to appeal under this rule. The final rule retains the 45-day filingperiod, with no extension permitted, for those appealing a decision ona project or activity. However, taking into consideration the public comment,the final rule has been modified to provide a 90-day filing period forthose appealing a decision on a land and resource management plan approval,significant amendment, or revision, or on programmatic decisions documentedin a Record of Decision. It should be noted that the longer appeal perioddoes not change the effective date of the decision. Additionally, the final rule has been modified to limit when the ForestService can grant itself time extensions. Reviewing Officers will be permittedto extend the time of the review period only to request, acquire, and evaluateinformation needed to clarify issues, or to hold meetings to resolve issues.Responding to public concerns that the new rule just perpetuates currentForest Service practice of not following timelines, and recognizing asan agency that internal management must be improved, a new paragraph hasbeen added to clearly delineate how long the process should take. For clarity, and because all these changes deal with how the appeal processwill work, andSection; andSection; 217.9 and 217.10 have been combined. Thesesections are recoded andSection; 217.8 and retitled Appeal process sequence.Section 217.11 is recoded andSection; 217.9 Content of a notice of appeal.Proposed paragraph (b)(7) would have required appellants to state whetherthey had participated in predecisional activities. This paragraph has beendropped from the final rule because of the confusion it caused. Even thoughknowing whether or not an appellant has participated in predecisional mattersis desirable, whether or not a participant was involved in predecisionalmatters was not intended to be a basis for dismissal. However, this washow the public interpreted the requirement. To assist the public in understanding the timeframes and sequence of stepsunder the new rule, a flow chart of the process is set out at the end ofthis document as Appendix A; however it will not appear in the Code ofFederal Regulations.Section 217.12 Requests to delay implementation of a decision. Proposed Part 217 did not permit delaying implementation of a Forest plan,but provided for an automatic delay of implementation of projects or activitiesscheduled during pendency of the review, upon request, so that a meaningfulreview on the merits would be preserved. The delay decisions were not subjectto further discretionary review. <T3>Comments:</T3> Most of the comments received concerned five major themes,characterized as follows: (1) All parties concerned should be notifiedof a delay request and the decision to grant or deny the request; (2) ``urgentand compelling need'' should be defined, preferably with examples; (3)requests to delay implementation should be granted automatically <T3>except</T3> under extraordinary circumstances; (4) requests to delayshould be granted <T3>only</T3> under extraordinary circumstances; and, (5) there is a needfor clear and comprehensive guidelines (standards) for granting a delayrequest. Many respondents pointed to a dual standard because in 36 CFRPart 251 the appellant has to justify the request for stay while under36 CFR Part 217 the government is required to justify not granting a delayrequest. Several respondents wanted the denial of a delay request to be appealable.Lastly, many respondents thought that the proposed provision which excludesdelay of Forest plan implementation meant that subsequent projects wouldnot be subject to delay, and that this was unacceptable. And, some respondentsdisagreed with quoted language from the preamble, ``* * * there are notactions in a forest plan per se that would be immediately implementableand thus there are no actions to be stayed.'' <T3>Response:</T3> In retrospect, the language should have stated, ``** * there are <T3>seldom</T3> any actions in a forest plan per se that would be * * *immediately implementable, and thus there are no actions to be stayed ** *''. If a site specific project or activity is authorized in the forestplan, and which meets NEPA requirements, a delay should be considered ifimplementation would moot the review. Thus, the final language of the rulehas been modified to make such projects or activities within a plan subjectto delay if appellants so ask. It has always been the practice of the agency to notify all parties concernedabout stay decisions (referred to in the proposed rule as delay of implementationrequests). This will not change with new rules. The automatic stay device in the proposed rule was viewed as a way to preservea meaningful review and simultaneously avoid forcing a requester to Courtto obtain a restraining order. But in response to the dual standard concernsfor granting stays voiced by respondents, the final rule provides thatstay requests will not be automatically granted but will be consideredand that stay requests must include specific reasons why the delay is needed.It is on this basis that the Reviewing Officer will either grant or denya stay. Accordingly, the ``urgent and compelling'' standard is no longernecessary and has been deleted. Additionally, the term ``implementation'' in proposed paragraph (a) hasbeen changed to read ``approval.'' It was the intent of this paragraphto preclude stays of plan approvals, but to consider staying activitiesundertaken to implement the plan, which as a consequence might moot a reviewif prematurely implemented. This change clarifies this intent. For consistency with providing two levels of review on District Rangerdecisions, the final rule provides for discretionary review of a ForestSupervisor's decision on a stay request. And, consistent with other languagechanges for clarity and understanding, the final rule has been modifiedto use the term ``stay.'' This section is recoded andSection; 217.10 and retitled Stays.217.13 Review file.The proposal defined what consitutes the review file and specified howmuch time the Deciding Officer would have to assemble the relevant decisiondocuments and pertinent records and transmit them to the Reviewing Officer.In contrast to the current rule, the Deciding Officer would not be requiredto prepare a Responsive Statement. Instead, the proposal allowed the DecidingOfficer to respond briefly to issues raised in the request for review whentransmitting the file to the Reviewing Officer.<T3>Comments: </T3>Respondents voiced their concerns about the eliminationof the Responsive Statement. The most frequent comments pertained to thevalue of the Responsive Statement and the reply thereto in ``clarifying''the issues and in ``justifying'' the decision to proceed with an action.The Responsive Statement is seen by many as a way to foster dialogue aboutthe rationale for the decision, the meaning of special terminology or technicalmatters, and the intent of the proposed activity. Many said that the currentrequirement to prepare a Responsive Statement helps ensure that the DecidingOfficer understands an appellant's position.Additionally, some respondents pointed out that the responsive statementhad been eliminated in name only. Because the Deciding Officer would beallowed briefly to respond to issues in the transmittal letter, the letterwould be, in fact, a Responsive Statement, and the appellant is given noopportunity to review or respond.<T3>Response: </T3>Under the current rule, Responsive Statements are beingused to carry the burden of discussion and justifying a project, plan,or activity. The intent of 36 CFR Part 217 is to focus on the environmentaldocumentation and decision document completed as a consequence of the planningand decisionmaking process, and made available to those participating inthe decisionmaking process, and to others prior to an appeal being filed.If the decision document does not ``justify'' the decision to proceed withan action, or explain the rationale for the decision, it is inadequate.A Responsive Statement is not necessary for a Reviewing Officer to makethis determination. The purpose of eliminating the Responsive Statementis twofold: To expedite processing of an appeal and to ensure that NEPA-baseddecisions are adequately documented. The result should be better decisiondocuments that reflect environmental disclosures and explain managementaction rationale. For these reasons, the final rule does not reinstatethe requirement of a Responsive Statement. To prevent transmittal lettersfrom becoming de facto Responsive Statements, the final rule deletes theprovision allowing the Deciding Officer to respond to issues raised inthe request for review, but retains the requirement that the Deciding Officeridentify where in the documentation appellant's issues are addressed. Thetransmittal letter wil be made available to appellants and intervenors.Other modifications to this section include giving Deciding Officers 30days to transmit the record, instead of the proposed 21 days. This is becausethe rule has been modified to eliminate time extensions for this purpose,which under the current rule have nearly always been granted if requested.Lastly, taking into account other changes, the final rule states that therecord closes either when the Deciding Officer forwards the record or whenintervenors' comments are received, which ever is the latter.This section is recoded and retitled andSection; 217.15 Appeal record.Section 217.14 Authority of reviewing officer in conduct of a review.Part 217, as proposed, authorized the Reviewing Officer to establish whateverprocedures are necessary to ensure orderly and expeditious conduct of areview. This section retained the provision of the current rule at 36 CFR211.18 allowing a Reviewing Officer to consolidate reviews of the samedecision or similar decisions involving common issues of fact or law. Inkeeping with the informal nature of the proposed review process, the ReviewingOfficer has the authority to discuss issues related to the review withrequesters, the Deciding Officer, or those who submit comments.<T3>Comments: </T3>Part 217, as proposed, would permit free and open communicationbetween parties with no requirement that these communications be documentedor shared. Because of this, respondents raised the question of ``<T3>ex parte</T3>'' communications in which the Reviewing Officer is influencedby these discussions and the requester is not informed about them. Mostrespondents stated that the public had a right to know. The comments frequentlyused strong language to characterize this feature, such as unfair, undemocratic,prejudicial, secrecy, ``back room deals,'' hiding information, etc. A fewcomments reflected a fear that internal documents would be immune to publicreview and that public participation would be discouraged.One respondent suggested that, for purposes of issuing one decision, consolidationof appeals filed pursuant to Part 251 and reviews requested pursuant toPart 217 should be permitted, provided, of course, that both involve thesame initial decision.<T3>Response: </T3>This section has been modified to make it clear thatany information sought by or otherwise utilized by the Reviewing Officermust be documented and shared among and between appellants and intervenorswith opportunity afforded for comment. However, communications among orbetween the Deciding Officer, appellants, or intervenors do not have tobe documented and made part of the record. Consolidation of review of appealsfiled under Parts 217 and 251 which involve the same decision is not permitted,but the rules make clear that issuing only one decision may be appropriate.In addition, as discussed under andSection; 217.10, Reviewing Officers willbe permitted to extend the time of the review period only to request, acquire,and evaluate information needed to clarify issues, or to hold meetingsto resolve issues.This section is recoded as andSection; 217.13 and retitled, ``Reviewing officerauthority.'' Additionally, that portion dealing with discretionary reviewhas been removed from this section and incorporated in andSection; 217.17Discretionary review.217.15 Review decision.The proposal established timelines for review decisions, 30 days for projectdecisions and 90 days for LRMP's, and stipulated that if no decision ismade within 30 days once a decision is accepted for discretionary review,the lower level decision stands.<T3>Comments: </T3>Several respondents felt it was unfair to allow theForest Service twice the time to issue a decision on an appeal of a Forestplan decision (90 days) than is allowed for an appellant to read and reviewthe plan, gather data, and prepare the request (45 days).As discussed in andSection; 217.8, many respondents found the idea of discretionaryreview unsatisfactory, voicing concerns that the timeframes would forcea hurried review, because the 15-day period was insufficient to exercisediscretion, and the 30-day second level review period was too short. Theserespondents believed that the appellants would be punished by Forest Serviceprocrastination or choosing to ignore the appeal, as the lower level decisionwould stand if timelines were not met.<T3>Response: </T3>The 90-day timeframe for a Reviewing Officer to rendera decision on an appeal of a Forest plan decision is retained in the finalrule. As discussed under proposed andSection;217.9, the time available toprepare and file an appeal of a Forest plan has been modified. Thus, appellantsof Forest plan decisions will have the same amount of time to prepare theirappeal as the Reviewing Officer has to render a decision.In response to comments that criteria are needed to guide a second levelReviewing Officer when deciding whether or not to review a lower levelappeal decision, the final rule has been modified in andSection;217.16 toexplain circumstances under which a Reviewing Officer might elect to exercisediscretionary review of a lower decision. For example, a Reviewing Officerwould consider such factors as controversy and litigation potential.While the 15-day period provided for deciding whether to conduct a discretionaryreview of the lower level appeal or dismissal decision is unacceptableto some respondents, it is 5 days more than currently provided at the Chief'slevel. Thus, it is retained in the final rule. However, a provision hasbeen added to the final rule stating that if the Reviewing Officer sendsfor the record at this point, the 15-day time period is suspended. TheDeciding Officer has 5 days to send it forward. Upon receipt, the higherlevel Reviewing Officer will have 15 days to decide whether to conducta discretionary review. It should be noted that the agency recognizes thatit must improve its internal management of the process itself. This willrequire strengthening management controls, including those to be institutedby the Forest Service to assure that the discretionary review process workseffectively and as it was intended. These will be issued as amendmentsto Forest Service Manual 1571 and Forest Service Handbook 1509.12 as directionto Forest Service personnel. Finally, the paragraph on discretionary reviewhas been moved to a new section, andSection;217.17 Discretionary review.The agency agrees with those respondents who expressed concern about appellantsbeing punished by Forest Service procrastination. Therefore, the provisionfor automatically terminating the discretionary review after 30 days hasbeen deleted and a statement releasing appellants from the administrativeprocess has been added in the final rule. This section is recoded as andSection;217.16and retitled ``Decision.''217.16 Dismissal without review and decision.The proposal specified the circumstances which would allow the dismissalof a review request without review.<T3>Comments: </T3>Provision for dismissal without review was of considerableconcern. Some respondents felt that the reasons for dismissal in the proposedrule were not clearly defined and that they would be interpreted subjectively,or used by the Forest Service to abuse the process. Several respondentssuggested that the reasons for dismissal should be documented and thatthe decision to dismiss should be subject to discretionary review.<T3>Response: </T3>The Forest Service agrees. As is the current practice,the agency will require a Reviewing Officer to document the reasons fordismissal in a decision letter. The omission of language to this effectin the proposed rule was an oversight. The final rule has been amendedto direct the Reviewing Officer to provide written notice of a dismissalincluding an explanation of why the appeal is dismissed. And, on the basisof fairness and objectivity of review, the final rule has been modifiedto provide discretionary review of dismissal decisions. The final languagecross-references new paragraph andSection;217.7(d) for clarification.We believe the rule clearly defines the circumstances under which an appealwill be dismissed, and no modification is required.This section is recoded andSection;217.11 and retitled ``Dismissal withoutreview.''Section 217.17 Resolution of issues during review.The proposal made explicit the ability of the Deciding Officer to negotiatewith those challenging a decision through the review process, and for ReviewingOfficer to extend time for doing so. The proposed rule also provided thatDeciding Officers could withdraw their initial decisions.<T3>Comments: </T3>Some respondents were skeptical about and others opposedto the concept of seeking issue resolution after an appeal had been filed.They were concerned about compromising professional integrity and causinglong delays in projects. Others were concerned that the Forest Servicewould use the resolution process to suspend action on an appeal, whileallowing Forest plan direction to be implemented.Most of the comments received supported the idea of a negotiated settlement,and offered additional suggestions. One respondent felt that the proposalwould be strengthened by adding from 36 CFR Part 251 the mandatory ``invitationto meet'' language now required in decision letters to instrument holders.Several respondents were worried that the extension of deadlines wouldbe abused, and unreasonable delays would occur. Suggestions included addinga definite time period to accomplish the negotiations; stipulating thatthe requester, Deciding Officer, Reviewing Officer, and other affectedparties must agree to any extensions.Additional concerns were expressed about communications during negotiations.Several respondents suggested that all affected parties be invited to participatein the negotiations. Because in the past some respondents had experienceda reluctance from the Forest Service to negotiate, several suggested thatappellants, or even Reviewing Officers, should be able to request a negotiationsession, not just the Deciding Officer.<T3>Response: </T3>The Forest Service considered including the ``invitationto meet'' language from proposed 36 CFR Part 251 in proposed 36 CFR Part217. However, it was not included because who might appeal is not knownat the time a decision is recorded. Instead, the idea behind the ``invitationto meet'' proposed in 36 CFR Part 251 is embodied in this section and givesthe Deciding Officer encouragement to meet with appellants and intervenorsduring the process to resolve issues. However, we agree that extensionsof time to permit negotiations to occur should not be open ended. The finalrule requires the Reviewing Officer to establish a reasonable duration.To require all parties to agree to any extensions is impractical, and inmany cases an unlikely prospect. Some participants may be willing to workout solutions, and this prospect is more important than requiring all partiesto agree to extensions. Therefore, this condition is not included in thefinal rule. The agency concurs with those respondents expressing concernabout overcoming a reluctance to negotiate. There are some Forest Serviceofficers who prefer a more structured appeals process rather than an informalnegotiation process. Therefore, the final rule language is modified toallow Deciding Officers, Reviewing Officers, appellants, and intervenorsto request meetings to resolve issues. However, to preserve a ReviewingOfficer's independence and objectivity should settlement not occur, thefinal rule provides that even though the Reviewing Officer may requestthat a meeting be held, Reviewing Officers may not participate in negotiationswith appellants and/or intervenors, a limitation which overcomes problemsassociated with <T3>ex parte </T3>communications.This section is recoded andSection;217.12, and retitled ``Resolution of issues.''Section 217.18 Policy in event of judicial proceedings.This section in the proposed rule created no new policy; it merely articulatedlongstanding practice consistent with judicial precedent favoring completionof the administrative process prior to court involvement.<T3>Comments:</T3> The comments on this issue were few but emphatic. Respondentscriticized the proposed language in other parts of the rule that wouldlimit the kind of information included in the record or available to partiesto the appeal, i.e., undocumented conversations or other information notshared with parties to the appeal. Absent an equitable procedure for sharinginformation, an inadequate administrative record is the result. Therefore,exhaustion of the administrative procedures in 36 CFR Part 217 should notbe required of appellants as a prerequisite to direct access to court,because a court would not limit itself to an inadequate administrativerecord. Respondents also expressed concern that the Forest Service couldfrustrate appellants' access to court by delaying decisionmaking throughmanipulating extensions of time.<T3>Response:</T3> As discussed in andSection;217.14, the final rule hasbeen modified to make it clear that it is the information sought by theReviewing Officer that must be documented and shared with all participantswith opportunity for comment provided. The Forest Service believes thatthis clarification in the final rule resolves the concern. Therefore, thissection is retained. However, it has been modified to permit the Chiefto waive the policy on a case-by-case basis.<ITAG tagnum="84">General Comment on Proposed Rule 36 CFR Part 251</ITAG>Much less comment was received about this rule than the proposal for 36CFR Part 217. However, the comment generally centered around the same majorconcerns expressed about 36 CFR Part 217, and most of it appeared to befrom individuals and organizations who would not be eligible to utilizethis rule.The following summarizes the major comments and suggestions received onthe proposed revision of 36 CFR Part 251, Subpart C, and the Department'sresponse to these comments. Many respondents felt that the proposed rulewas hard to follow. Thus, the final rule has been rearranged to more closelyfollow the steps in the process, and the headings have been retitled tobetter describe their contents. However, comments are keyed to the sectionnumbers and headings of the proposed rule document.Section 251.80 Purpose and scope.The proposed rule asserted that it established a fair and deliberate processfor appealing and reviewing written decisions arising from the issuance,approval, and administration of written instruments that authorize theoccupancy and use of National Forest System land.<T3>Comments: </T3>Those commenting on this section focused on the unfairnessof two rules. They said it was inconsistent with the tenets of due processas well as unworkable. They also voiced concerns because it does not providefor an impartial judge. Others were concerned because they already feelthey are in a weak bargaining position with the Forest Service and thatthis rule will make it worse.<T3>Response:</T3> The agency disagrees that this rule is inconsistentwith the tenets of due process. In fact, this rule is a structured, grievance-orientedrule that provides the elements of due process that are fundamental toresolving issues that arise from a business or legal relationship betweenthe Forest Service and an appellant. It is quite similar in this respectto the current rule, 36 CFR 211.18. As pointed out in the discussion ofOptions Considered in the proposed rule document, the agency consideredan independent board or impartial judge. However, this idea was rejectedbecause such a formalized process may intensify adversarial relationshipswith the agency. Such a relationship is counter to the Forest Service commitmentand desire to increase communication and cooperation with the public. Inaddition, the independent board or judge approach to appeal administrationwould tend to erode the agency's statutory authority to administer itsprograms and to supervise, correct, or redirect its operations. Therefore,the final rule remains an internal administrative appeal procedure.The final rule retains this section, as proposed.Section 251.81 Applicability and effective date.This section would allow for the continuance of appeals related to writteninstruments that have already been brought under the current rule: 36 CFR211.18, 36 CFR 228.14, or 36 CFR 292.15. No comments were received. Thefinal rule retains this section as proposed; however, it is recoded asandSection;251.102.Section 251.82 Definitions and terminology.This section defines the terms used in this subpart. No comments were received.The final rule retains this section as proposed, however, it is recodedas andSection;251.81.Section 251.83 Parties eligible to participate.The rule proposed three types of parties eligible to participate: (1) Appellants_thatis a holder of a written instrument or authorization or an applicant whois applying for an authorization in response to a solicitation by the ForestService; (2) intervenors_other applicants for the same authorization, orholders of similar authorizations who have a direct interest that couldbe directly impacted by the appeal decision; and (3) the Deciding Officer.<T3>Comments: </T3>There were many comments voiced about eligibility. Somerespondents said it was too narrow as to who was eligible because it didn'tapply to all applicants, and that it prevents adjacent landowners fromappealing issuance of permits for activities which would have a negativeenvironmental impact on their lands. Some respondents believed that Statesshould have an opportunity to appeal or intervene. Others suggested allowinggroups to intervene who supported either the permittee or appellant orthose who would be affected by the appeal decision.<T3>Response:</T3> The limitations on who can appeal and intervene areessential to this rule, because it is designed only to resolve issues arisingfrom a decision to issue or approve, to deny issuance or approval, or toadminister an existing authorization. These persons have a business orlegal relationship with the Forest Service by virtue of the applicationfor or the holding of a written instrument, and because of that relationshipmust have a procedure for bringing and resolving grievances.Those who object to the use of the lands or resources to be covered bythe issuance of an authorization can request review of the basic decisionunder 36 CFR Part 217 if this basic decision involves documentation requiredby agency planning and environmental analysis procedures. In addition,the initial allocation decision made through Forest level planning is reviewableunder 36 CFR Part 217.Therefore, this section has been retained in its entirety and is recodedandSection; 251.86 and retitled Parties.Section 251.84 Appealable decisions.This section of the proposed rule lists the written decisions arising fromspecific types of permitted uses of National Forest System lands that canbe appealed. The decisions vary from approval of grazing of livestock toapprovals of special use permits. The approval of plans of mining operationspursuant to 36 CFR Part 228 and 36 CFR 292.17 and 292.18 would be addedto the list of appealable decisions, ending previous separate processes.It also gives instructions for how notice of decisions appealable underthis rule will be given. <T3>Comments:</T3> Comments on this section generally dealt with specificquestions on different types of decisions and whether or not they wereappealable under this rule. For instance, Memorandums of Understanding(MOU), purchases of forest lands under 16 U.S.C. 521c-521i; decisions notto proceed with exchanges and disapproval of surface use plans. Other commentsincluded questions about which rule would govern if a permit action triggereda NEPA review, and why notices of decision were sent only to applicantsor holders and not to other National Forest users. One respondent suggestedmaking the list of instruments non-inclusive so that future ones couldbe included.<T3>Response:</T3> If the decision on a MOU is recorded through NEPA procedures,the decision is appealable under the procedures outlined in 36 CFR Part217. However, later action under the MOU would be appealable by the holderof a permit under 36 CFR Part 251.Section 251.86 of the proposed rule speaks to those situations where adecision could be appealed under both rules. An appellant eligible to appealunder either rule must choose which review process will be used and forfeitsall right to use the other process.Decisions covered under 16 U.S.C. 521c-521i usually entail NEPA complianceand, therefore, would be appealable under 36 CFR Part 217. We agree thatdecisions not to proceed with an exchange or disapproval of a surface useplan should also be listed. We also agree with the suggestion that thelist be non-inclusive. The final rule language has been revised to includeboth of these items.Because the matter under appeal is between the Forest Service and the holderof a permit or an applicant for a permit, extensive public notice requirementsare not necessary unless the action involved NEPA, in which case the noticerequirements of 36 CFR Part 217 must be met. A new section is added tothe final rule, andSection; 251.84 Obtaining notice, and the language aboutnotice in proposed andSection; 251.84 has been incorporated in this new section.The final rule clarifies that prompt notice is required. Also, this sectionis recoded andSection; 251.82.Section 251.85 Decisions not appealable under this subpart.This section excludes from appeal the same decisions that are currentlyexcluded under 36 CFR 211.18. In addition, it updates the list to reflectthe enforcement of Uniform Rules for Protection of Archaeological Resourcesat 36 CFR Part 296, orders related to 36 CFR Part 261, decisions relatedto rehabilitation of National Forest System lands resulting from naturalcatastrophes if a Regional Forester or the Chief gives notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, and decisions covered by 36 CFR Part 217.<T3>Comments:</T3> Comments on this section generally addressed the exclusionof decisions related to rehabilitation for National Forest System landsresulting from natural catastrophes. Some respondents expressed the opinionthat it is unnecessary to list these as exclusions since the Regional Foresteror Chief would exclude them via <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. Other respondents said the rule (andSection;251.85(k)) was unclear concerning which NEPA decisions were appealableand which were excluded.<T3>Response:</T3> The agency expects most decisions resulting from naturalcatastrophes will not be excluded except under extraordinary circumstances.In any event, a decision to exclude does not excuse the Regional Foresteror Chief from NEPA compliance on the rehabilitation decision. A holderof a written instrument or an applicant could appeal under 36 CFR Part251 or 36 CFR Part 217 depending on how the decision affects them. Therefore,it is appropriate to have the rehabilitation exclusion proviso in thissection, and the final rule retains it.Paragraph (k) refers to intermediate decisions. This exclusion continuescurrent practice. Only the final decision, as documented in a Record ofDecision, Decision Notice, or Decision Memo is appealable under 36 CFRPart 217, except as provided for at 36 CFR 251.86. The final rule retainsthis exclusion.This section is recoded as andSection; 251.83, and retitled Decisions notappealable.Section 251.86 Election of appropriate review procedure.This section covers those instances when a decision might be appealableunder this rule as well as reviewable under Part 217. It requires the appellantto choose the appropriate review process, and further advises that an appellantthereby forfeits all right to use the other process for that decision.<T3>Comments:</T3> Respondents on this section questioned the likelihoodof the same decision being appealable and reviewable under both rules.They voiced the opinion that it just complicates the process and doubtedits usefulness. Others suggested permitting participation under 36 CFRPart 217 even if an appellant has elected appeal under 36 CFR Part 251.<T3>Response:</T3> It is possible that a decision could be made that isboth appealable under this rule and reviewable under 36 CFR Part 217, butit should be a fairly rare circumstance. Therefore, this procedure is necessary.The choice of formal or informal review should be the applicant's or instrumentholder's choice to make, not the Forest Service's choice. However, thefinal rule now includes a provision for appellants under this rule to participatein a review being conducted under 36 CFR 217.6(b).The final rule retains this section but recodes it as andSection; 251.85,retitled ``Election of appeal process.''Section 251.87 Levels of review available.The proposed rule change offers one level of appeal but makes the secondlevel of review at the discretion of that officer.<T3>Comments:</T3> Many respondents objected to the concept of a one-levelappeal process in this rule for the same reasons outlined in the sectiondiscussing the public comment received on 36 CFR Part 217. Therefore, thediscussion is not repeated here.<T3>Response:</T3> Similarly, and consistent with the final rule at 36CFR Part 217, the final rule provides for a two-level appeal process fordecisions made at the District Ranger level. However, second level appealof a Ranger Decision by the Regional Forester will not be automatic. Theappellant will have to request it; the review will be based solely on theexisting record without any additional submissions; and, the second leveldecision will not receive further review. Also consistent with the changes at 36 CFR Part 217, dismissal decisionswill be subject to discretionary review. A new paragraph (d) was addedin the final rule to clarify this change. The provisions detailing how discretionary review will work has been movedto a new section, andSection; 251.100 Discretionary review, bringing intoone place all references to discretionary review. In the proposed rule,these references were found in andSection;andSection; 251.87, 251.89, 251.94,251.97, 251.98, and 251.99. The comments on discretionary review are furtherresponded to under andSection; 251.99 Appeal decision. Section 251.88 Filing procedures and timeliness. The procedures of this section are different from the current rule in twonotable ways. One, under the proposed rule, an appellant would file anappeal with the Reviewing Officer instead of the Deciding Officer. Second,the filing period which would end 45 days from the date of the writtendecision, is not extendable, and timeliness decisions are not subject toappeal. <T3>Comments:</T3> Comments received on this section questioned the appealperiod beginning on the date the decision is signed. They felt it shouldbegin after the appellant receives the decision. They went on to say thatthe agency should use Certified Mail to establish this date and to establishtimely filing by the appellant. Other respondents questioned whether itwas the postmark or receipt at the designated office that established timelyfiling. Some respondents perceived that the filing period had been shortened andasserted that the possibility for time extensions must be included alongwith extending the 20-day period appellants have to reply to the ResponsiveStatement. <T3>Response:</T3> The only date the Forest Service can control is thedate of the decision. It would be extremely confusing for everyone concernedto have differing dates should there be multiple appeals. Furthermore,the proposed language follows current practice. Using Certified Mail toestablish the date does not guarantee the party will receive it in a timelymanner, and, therefore, the appeal period might never begin for that party.Current practice by the Forest Service is to send appeal related correspondencevia certified mail within a day of the decision. The proposed rule doesnot preclude Forest officers from continuing this practice. The agencycannot require appellants to use certified mail. As in current practice,timely filing will be ascertained by the postmarked date if the documentsare mailed, or delivery date if others means are used. The proposed rule language provided for the same length of time to filea first level appeal as the current appeal rule.The discussion that follows on andSection; 251.89 addresses the concernsvoiced on time extensions. This section is retitled ``Filing procedures.'' A flow chart of the processwill be set out at the end of this document as Appendix B, but it willnot appear in the Code of Federal Regulations.Section 251.89 Extension of time.This section would give a Reviewing Officer the discretion to extend alltime lines expressed in the rule except the time to file a notice of appealand for discretionary reviews of appeal decisions. <T3>Comments:</T3> The only comment received on this section urged thatinstead of granting time extensions, both parties be placed on a rigidtime table. It was suggested that if the appellant fails to meet any ofthe time lines, the Forest Service decision should stand; and if the ForestService fails to meet any of the time lines, the appellant should prevailand the decision be changed to reflect the relief requested in the appellant'snotice of appeal. <T3>Response:</T3> The agency believes there are instances involving writteninstrument authorizations when extenuating cirumstances prevail and extendingthe time lines is necessary and appropriate. Therefore, the final ruleretains the language from the proposal. It is retitled ``Time extensions.''Section 251.90 Notice of appeal content. The proposed rule made clear that the appellant bears the burden of proofin their notice of appeal as to why a decision should be changed. It includeda detailed list of information to be provided by the appellant. <T3>Comments:</T3> Those commenting on this section focused on three areasof concern. First, the fact that the Statement of Reasons must accompanythe Notice of Appeal and the time provided was insufficient to prepareall this information; second, that there is no provision for correctingdeficiencies; and last, there is no provision for notifying Deciding Officersabout receipt of an appeal so their preparation of the Responsive Statementcan begin. <T3>Response:</T3> The agency believes that the time provided is adequate.Most matters involving written instrument will be relatively straight forwardand will not require additional time. The rules, as proposed, did not prohibitcorrecting deficiencies or augmenting initial submissions with additionalsubmissions. As is the current practice, however, if additional informationis submitted for the record, it must be shared with all parties in a timelymanner that will allow them time for comment prior to the record closing.The proposed rule did require simultaneous filing of an appeal with theDeciding Officer in andSection; 251.89. This triggers the Deciding Officer'spreparation of the Responsive Statement. The final rule retains the proposed language; however, it is retitled ``Contentof notice of appeal.''Section 251.91 Responsive statement.The proposed rule retains the features of the current rule with regardto responsive statements. A Deciding Officer must prepare the ResponsiveStatement within 30 days and send to the appellant a statement respondingto the facts, or issues of law or regulation alleged by an appellant. Acopy must also be sent to any intervenors. All parties have 20 days toreply to the Responsive Statement. <T3>Comments:</T3> Those comments addressing this section were concernedwith two areas. First, that only permittees received a copy of the responsivestatement and not the public. Second, that the 20-day time period to commenton the responsive statement is tied to the postmarked date of the responsivestatement rather than the day it is received.<T3>Response:</T3> It is fundamental to this rule that parties to the appealbe apprised of information submitted to the record and provided an opportunityto reply to the information. Because the public is not a party to the appeal,they are not entitled to receive a copy of the responsive statement. Thisis consistent with the current rule. The only date the Forest Service can control is the date it is mailed.It is not practicable to use the receipt date. Therefore, the final ruleretains the proposed language. However, it is recoded and retitled, andSection;251.94 Responsive statement. Section 251.92 Implementation and request for stay of implementation. The proposed rule allowed implementation of a decision under appeal unlessa stay is requested and granted. This section incorporates most of thecontent requirements of the existing rule for requesting a stay.<T3>Comments:</T3> There were two differing opinions expressed on thissection. Some respondents felt that it should be deleted altogether becausemost stay requests are frivolous and used as a delay tactic. The otherrespondents voiced the opinion that stays should be granted automatically.<T3>Response: </T3>Decisions appealable under this rule involve holdersand certain applicants who enjoy a business or legal relationship withthe Forest Service. This provision is needed to ensure that the appealis not mooted by implementation of the decision prior to review of thedisputed decision. The agency does not believe that most stay requestsfiled pursuant to the current rule are frivolous. By their very nature,a stay is a delaying mechanism. However, as noted above, it is a necessaryone.The final rule retains the language as proposed but combines this sectionwith andSection;andSection; 251.93 and 251.94. The combined sections are recodedand retitled as andSection; 251.91 Stays.Section 251.93 Ruling on stay requests.This section, as proposed, permits the Reviewing Officer to deny a stayif the decision appealed is not scheduled to take effect during pendencyof the appeal. The section also requires the Reviewing Officer to ruleon stay requests within 10 calendar days from receipt, and also lists thecriteria a Reviewing Officer shall consider in ruling on stay requests.And, as is the current practice, the proposed rule required the ReviewingOfficer to issue a written decision and specified the content of the decisionletter, depending on the decision.<T3>Comments:</T3> The only comment on this section voiced concern thatthe language in paragraph (b) could expose the Forest Service to chargesof being arbitrary. Without elaborating, the contention appears to be basedon respondent's view that andSection; 251.93(b) gives blanket authority fordenial, while andSection; 251.92 requires appellants to justify a stay request.<T3>Response: </T3>The agency has reviewed the proposed language and doesnot agree that paragraph (b) could be considered arbitrary. It is a signalto appellants to utilize the stay procedures judiciously and not to clogthe process with meaningless requests. As discussed in the preamble tothe proposed rule, the purpose of a stay is to delay implementation ofa decision under appeal if harmful effects to the appellant could occurduring pendency of the appeal. It makes no sense to process paperwork fordecisions that will not take effect until after the appeal decision isrendered. Thus, the final rule modifies the provision for denial of a staywhere implementation is not imminent to say that the Reviewing Officerwill not accept such requests. And, for consistency with providing twolevels of review on District Ranger decisions, the final rule providesfor discretionary review of a Forest Supervisor's decision on a stay request.The final rule combines this section with andSection;andSection; 251.92 and251.94. The combined section is retitled ``Stays'' and coded as andSection;251.91.Section 251.94 Duration of and changes to stay decisions.The proposed language establishes that stays will remain in effect duringthe 15-day period for determining discretionary review. Further, a ReviewingOfficer may change a stay decision at any time that circumstances supporta change. Petitions to change will also be accepted. Stay decisions orchanges thereto are not appealable. No comments on this section were received.The final rule retains the language as proposed but incorporates it inandSection; 251.91 Stays.Section 251.95 Intervention.Under the proposed rule, intervention would be limited to applicants foror holders of a written instrument of the same or a similar type that isthe subject of or affected by the appeal, and have an interest that couldbe directly affected by an appeal decision. Intervenors would not be ableto continue an appeal if the appellant withdraws the appeal.<T3>Comments:</T3> Two areas of concern were surfaced from those commentingon this section. Many respondents believed that the proposal was too limitingas to who could intervene. Some believed that anyone with an immediateinterest or affected by the decision should be allowed to intervene. Otherrespondents said the proposal prevented organizations from interveningon behalf of holders.The other area of concern was continuance of an appeal. Respondents believedthat they have the right to continue an appeal even if the appellant withdraws.<T3>Response: </T3>The proposed rule is limited, by virtue of a writteninstrument, to those persons who have a business or legal relationshipwith the Forest Service that is established by the instrument. It is, therefore,appropriate and necessary to limit the basis for intervention in an appealunder the proposed rule to parties who have a similar relationship thatcould be affected by the disputed decision. In many instances, the decisionto grant or to deny a particular use of lands or resources under a writteninstrument may be preceded by environmental analysis and documented pursuantto agency planning and decision making procedures (36 CFR Part 219 and40 CFR Parts 1500 through 1508 and associated implementing regulations).Consequently, the general public has opportunity at this point to appealunder 36 CFR Part 217.Since an intervenor would not be a party to an appeal unless an appellanthad appealed, it is only logical that there is no further standing foran intervenor to carry on an appeal mooted by withdrawal. Intervenors aredefined as those having an interest that could be directly affected bythe decision on the appeal. If there is no appeal decision because theappeal is withdrawn, there is no effect on the intervenor.Therefore, the final rule retains the language proposed. The section isrecoded andSection; 251.96.Section 251.96 Oral presentations.The proposed rule established the purpose of the oral presentation andthat they can be held either in person or by phone. A request for an oralpresentation that accompanies a notice of appeal would be granted automatically;requests received later would also be considered but the decision to grantthe request would be discretionary. Decisions on oral presentation requestswould not be appealable.Appellant and intervenors must bear any expense in attending an oral presentation.And, the presentation may be open to public attendance, but to participation,at the Reviewing Officer's discretion.<T3>Comments:</T3> Respondents on this section voiced a concern that partiesmust bear any expense of participation. Some suggested that the oral presentationshould take place as close to the site involved as possible while otherssuggested making oral presentations discretionary.Respondents also found unacceptable the option for public attendance atthe oral presentation. <T3>Response: </T3>While the agency is sympathetic, the Government cannotassume costs for either conference calls or transportation associated withan oral presentation, except on its own behalf. Neither is the Forest Servicerequired to arrange an oral presentation at a location or in a manner thatis disadvantageous to the Government. Moreover, the proposal is consistentwith current practice.Practice under the current rule usually limits attendance to the partiesinvolved in the appeal; however, members of the general public sometimesrequest, and receive, permission to attend at the discretion of the ReviewingOfficer. The proposal incorporated this policy. Because the appeal processis an open process, this provision is retained in the final rule. The remainderof this section is also retained without change in the final rule; however,the section is recoded andSection; 251.97.Section 251.97 Authority of reviewing officer in conduct of appeal.This section would authorize the Reviewing Officer to establish whateverprocedures are necessary to ensure an orderly, expeditious, and fair conductof an appeal. Such procedural matters would not be subject to appeal andfurther review. The proposal retains the current provision allowing a ReviewingOffice to consolidate appeals. The proposed rule also makes clear thatthe Reviewing Officer may ask for additional information from any partyto an appeal, but all parties must be notified of the request and receivecopies of any information supplied. This section stipulates that an appealof a Chief's initial decision conducted by the Secretary would be subjectto the same rules and procedures applicable to all other first level appeals.This section also addresses procedures applicable to conduct of discretionaryreviews.<T3>Comments:</T3> Respondents commented on two segments of this section:consolidation, and acquiring additional information. Most respondents commentingon consolidation were concerned with having no recourse to opposing consolidation.One respondent suggested that this section provide for consolidation ofappeals/reviews proceeding simultaneously under Parts 251 and 217. Otherssuggested that appellants should also be able to request consolidation.Some respondents suggested that any additional information sought by theReviewing Officer should be limited to information existing at the timeof the initial decision. Other respondents commented that if adequate documentationdid not exist for the original decision when it was made, the decisionshould be canceled rather than seeking additional information. Some respondentsalso expressed confusion about requirements for sharing acquired information.<T3>Response: </T3>As is the practice currently, appellants may registertheir opposition to consolidation. Experience shows consolidation of multipleappeals of the same or similar decision is a useful procedure to simplifypaperwork. And, the proposed language follows a longstanding practice currentlypermitted by the present rule. Appellants are seldom in a position to knowwhen consolidation is appropriate. However, incorporating the results ofa separate review of the same decision under Part 217 and an appeal underPart 251 into one decision is a good idea. As discussed in the correspondingsection of Part 217, the final rule has been modified to permit this atthe discretion of the Reviewing Officer.The provision for acquiring additional information does not imply thatthe Reviewing Officer could seek information that was not available tothe Deciding Officer when the decision was made. The final rule clarifiesthat additional information sought by the Reviewing Officer is solely forclarifying issues.This section is recoded as andSection; 251.95 and retitled ``Authority ofReviewing Officer.'' Additionally, the portions discussing discretionaryreview have been incorporated into a new section devoted exclusively todiscretionary review at andSection; 251.100.Section 251.98 Appeal record.This section defines what constitutes the appeal record at both the firstlevel and discretionary level of review. Additionally, this section prohibitsreopening the record at the discretionary level except when the Secretaryreviews an initial decision of the Chief.<T3>Comments:</T3> The respondents to this section questioned whether therecord would be available and all actions documented.<T3>Response: </T3>The proposed rule language makes clear that the appealrecord is open to the public throughout the appeal. Further, it detailswhat the record should contain.The final rule retains the language as proposed. However, the paragraphdiscussing discretionary review is moved to the new separate andSection;251.100. Section 251.99 Appeal decision. The proposed rule provided information to the Reviewing Officer on thenature of the decision to be rendered and continued the 30-day timeframefrom closure of the record for rendering a decision on the appeal. Thissection also set a 30-day period for rendering a decision if discretionaryreview is exercised.  <T3>Comments:</T3> Respondents to this section expressed concern aboutdiscretionary review. Some respondents believe that it gives the revieweran easy way out and is not responsive to public concerns. Further, somerespondents objected to decisions being made on whether or not to exercisediscretionary review without explanation being provided to parties.  Some respondents suggested that an extension clause be added to extendthe 30-day discretionary review period by 15 days on a priority basis.Other respondents suggested that appellants be given an opportunity towaive the discretionary review. There were also some respondents who objected to decisions on the meritsbeing made without being given an answer. A few respondents objected tothe Forest Service being able to grant itself additional time to renderthe decision.  <T3>Response:</T3> The agency would not expect a Reviewing Officer to escapereview by letting time expire. As discussed in Part 217, while the 15-dayperiod provided for deciding whether to conduct a discretionary reviewof the lower level appeal or dismissal decision is unacceptable to somerespondents, it is 5 days more than currently provided at the Chief's level.Thus, it is retained in the final rule. However, a provision has been addedto the final rule stating that if the Reviewing Officer sends for the recordat this point, the 15-day time period is suspended. The Deciding Officerhas 5 days to send it forward. Upon receipt, the higher level ReviewingOfficer will have 15 days to decide whether to conduct a discretionaryreview. It should be noted that the agency recognizes that it must improveits internal management of the process itself. This will require strengtheningmanagement controls, including those to be instituted by the Forest Serviceto assure that the discretionary review process works effectively and asit was intended. These will be issued as amendments to Forest Service Manual1571 and Forest Service Handbook 1509.12 as direction to Forest Servicepersonnel. While the suggestion for waiver of the discretionary reviewby the appellant has merit, it increases the paperwork involved. Requestingwaiver is not prohibited, so appellants have this option should they wishto use it. If, under the current rule the Secretary chooses not to exercisediscretionary review, no explanation of this decision is required or given.The final rule continues this practice, but appellants will be notified.This paragraph of this section has been moved and incorporated in the newsection devoted to discretionary review. Consistent with changes in Part 217, the provision for automatically terminatingthe discretionary review after 30 days has been deleted and a statementreleasing appellants from the administrative process has been added inthe final rule. The final rule also includes general criteria for the ReviewingOfficer to consider when contemplating discretionary review. For example,controversy surrounding the decision and potential for litigation. The agency noted that the proposed rule is confusing about what constitutes``issuing'' an appeal decision. Therefore, the final rule clarifies thispoint and stipulates that it will be mailed. As explained under andSection;251.89, the agency believes there are instancesinvolving written instrument authorizations when time extensions are necessary.For example, when a permittee must assemble records that are not readilyavailable. Moreover, the provision for requesting a time extension doesapply to both the agency and the appellant. Therefore, the final rule retainsthis provision. The remaining sections on dismissal (andSection;251.100), resolution of issues(andSection;251.101), and judicial proceedings (andSection;251.102), did notreceive specific comments. However, for consistency with the final ruleat 36 CFR 217.11, and in response to comment on the proposal at 36 CFR217.16, the provision on dismissal is modified to provide that dismissaldecisions are subject to discretionary review at the next higher administrativelevel, is cross-referenced to new paragraph andSection;251.87(d), and isrecoded andSection;251.92 in the final rule. Resolution of issues is recodedat andSection;251.93, and Policy in event of judicial proceedings is recodedat andSection;251.101 and modified similar to andSection;217.17 to permit theexhaustion policy to be waived by the Chief. Full attention has been given to the comments received in preparing thesefinal regulations. Therefore, the agency is adopting as a final rule, 36CFR Part 251, Subpart C and 36 CFR Part 217, with the changes discussedin this preamble and with the necessary conforming amendments to Parts211 and 228 which are adopted without change from the proposed rule. Inaddition, the final rule contains a conforming amendment to the rules inPart 292, Subpart C, to make clear that appeals of decisions related tothe standards for use, subdivision, and development of privately ownedproperty within the boundaries of the Sawtooth National Recreation Areaare subject to the final rules at 36 CFR Part 251.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact </ITAG>This proposed rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures and ExecutiveOrder 12291 on Federal Regulations. It has been determined that this isnot a major rule.
