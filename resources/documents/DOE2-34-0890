The results of the Phase 2 studywere used to define future production flowstreams. Additional productionscheduling was carried out to evaluate accelerated depletion of proveddeveloped reserves in the 29R, 31 C/D Shale and Northwest Stevens T Sand/NShale Reservoirs. Production, cost and investment schedules were developedfor the enhanced oil recovery projects identified in Phase 2. Price forecastswere provided by the Department of Energy.
