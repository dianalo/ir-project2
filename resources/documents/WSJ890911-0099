Reagan </HL><DD> 09/11/89 </DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO><TEXT>   One of the first questions often asked by those who know or discover that I tinker with writing as a low-cash-flow retirement hobby is, &quot;What kind of word processor do you use?&quot; Therefore, let me describe it as best I can.    It is a very compact, 67-year-old unit positioned midway between my ears, which makes it very tricky to repair or get at to install any up-to-date components.    Its memory chip is the most unpredictable element. I don't know the storage capacity, but it is much less than it once was. And it is quite erratic. Some days it functions well, yet on others the recall is pitifully small. And it even fluctuates greatly throughout the day, starting with a weak signal in the mornings and gradually improving as the day progresses. Furthermore, its recall span has shortened significantly, being infinitely superior for items stored recently than for those from a few months back. This is a marked change from the period between its 13th and 19th years of operation, when it knew absolutely everything.    Fortunately, I have it connected by telepathic modem to another memory unit in our household of similar construction. It is a feminine model which, amazingly, has total recall for data and events that time has somehow completely erased from my less durable unit. It dredges up innumerable details of events so long-past that when punched into my unit it simply flashes &quot;Will Not Compute.&quot;    I'm sure my aging processor will serve me well so long as I can maintain its compatibility with the unit mentioned in the preceding paragraph. This seems to be contingent to a large degree on its recall of selected units of information, like birthdays, anniversaries, Valentine's Day, etc. These I have stored on a separate floppy disk cell in a humidified, fortified compartment.    My particular model processor has one unique idiosyncrasy, not attendant to the better-known brand names. It is easily distracted from its work by such extraneous matters as ball games on TV or a ringing telephone.    It has several built-in features, such as spelling, grammar and synonym functions, although these may not measure up to the units now available in the industry. They were compiled many years ago in laboratories that appear primitive today.    My printer is in harmony with the rest of the system. It is a hand-operated, electric-powered, 40 wpm typewriter that has proved capable of handling the full range of output coming from the processor. With an occasional tune-up and ribbon replacement, it appears fit for additional extended service.    Since the warranty period for my system has long since passed, and its trade-in value would be exceedingly small, I hope to keep it operational for a few more years. After all, it's still working on the Great American Novel.    ---   Mr. Reagan, who lives in Topeka, Kan., is still state-of-the-art, as far as we're concerned. </TEXT></DOC>
