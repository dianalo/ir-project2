The bill that became law in Minnesota earlier this month takesaim at three high court decisions last June. The decisions placedthe burden of proof on employees and interpreted a racialdiscrimination law as applying to discrimination in hiring, notdiscrimination on the job.   The sponsor of the bill, Democratic Rep. Howard Orenstein, saidhe hoped Congress would approve legislation similar to his.   ``It sends a signal to Washington that the states will not standby while federal civil rights protections are cut back,'' Orensteinsaid.   The high court's three rulings have been deplored by civilrights advocates, who say they make it tougher for discriminationlawsuits to be pressed under federal law.   The three rulings were among five decisions issued by the Courtlast summer. All three were handed down by a 5-to-4 margin.   The Minnesota measure would allow discrimination suits in hiringdecisions, as well as any time after the person was hired.Subcontractors could make similar discrimination claims against acontractor.   The law requires employers to prove that a job requirement thathas the effect of screening out minority members or women isjustified as a ``business necessity.''   A provision also would give plaintiffs more time to file a suitalleging that an employer's seniority system was discriminatory.   Congress is considering legislation proposed by Democratic Sen.Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. On Tuesday, the bill passed theHouse Education and Labor Committee on a 23-10 vote. President Bushhas said he would veto the measure, which is opposed by businessinterests.   Julius Chambers, director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense andEducational Fund, told The New York Times that Minnesota is thefirst state to confront the Supreme Court decisions so broadly. Hesaid Massachusetts has passed a much narrower bill.   ``The Minnesota action closes a big gap,'' Chambers told thenewspaper. ``It has important lessons for people in Washington andother states.''</TEXT></DOC>
