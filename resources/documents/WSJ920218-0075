Radical economic reforms adopted in January 1990, workedout with Western advisers and hailed as a model for formerSoviet states' evolving economies, met increasing resistance,despite success in lowering inflation and restoring goods toshops in a private-sector boom. State enterprises thatdominate production went into a tailspin. Poland's grossdomestic product fell 8% to 10% last year and unemploymentrose to 11.4%.   Warsaw will shift from fiscal austerity and tight-moneypolicies, and move toward government investment to helpenterprises retool to become competitive, and easier creditto overcome recession. State-guaranteed prices will berestored for some crops. But the plan doesn't abandon theinflation fight, and the government deficit is to be curbedpartly by new taxes and price increases.   In protest, Finance Minister Karol Lutkowski quit aftertwo weeks in office. He was the fourth senior FinanceMinistry official to resign in the past month over moves todrop monetarist policy.                                                                                                          EXPORT BAN ON HUNGARY LIFTED                                                                                                          Hungary was provisionally removed from the export ban listof the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral ExportControls. Cocom regulates exports of sensitive goods tonations of the former East bloc. Hungary must first complywith export control regulations, such as extending them toall domestic products shipped out and abiding by Cocom'snuclear and military ban list. Budapest said it would approvethe necessary measures soon. Hungary sought an easing ofCocom controls in 1990, but had to wait until Soviet troopscompleted their pullout last June.                                                                                                          ARMS-EXPORT CURBS IN GERMANY                                                                                                          The German Parliament's upper house passed a bill aimed atcurtailing illegal weapons deals with Third World dictators.The bill, which cleared the lower house on Jan. 23, allowscustoms investigators to tap telephones of suspected illegalweapons merchants and to open their mail. It also creates afederal agency to monitor exports. Profits from illicit armssales may be confiscated. The bill was prompted bydisclosures that German firms supplied Iraq with gear thatcould be used to build nuclear weapons.                                                                                                          PAY BOOST FOR NORTH KOREANS                                                                                                          North Korea will sharply raise all workers' wages and thegovernment's payments for agricultural goods, starting March1. Pay for factory workers, technicians and office employeeswill jump an average of 43%. Base wages weren't specified.Pensioners will get a 51% boost. In buying farm products,Pyongyang will pay 26% more for rice and 45% more for corn.Food prices in markets won't be changed. The governmentdidn't say how it would fund the increases.   PHILIPPINES TO OPEN AID FUNDS                                                                                                          Manila plans to offer a credit program giving privatefirms access to about $4 billion in official development aidfrom foreign donors and creditors. The Private SectorInvestment Development Fund aims to hasten foreign-fundedprojects under the U.S.-initiated Philippine AssistanceProgram. Private firms' participation is being encouraged inPAP projects, mostly infrastructure work, which Manila can'tdo for lack of money. Firms are expected to build and operatethese projects, enabling profits on investments.                                                                                                          PRAGUE BEGINS INVESTMENT ROUND                                                                                                          In the first round of slimming state ownership,Czechoslovaks began placing privatization coupons withinvestment funds. About 8.4 million citizens have bought thecoupons, which may be pooled in any of 437 sanctioned fundsset up by banks and private financial groups, or traded forshares in about 800 companies valued at $9 billion to be putinto private hands. The funds will compete with couponholders for shares when the privatization is completed.Foreigners are allowed to set up the investment funds.                                                                                                          SOUTHERN ASIA'S FUNDING RELIANCE                                                                                                          Developing countries' competition for limited external aidwill put greater pressure on Southern Asian nations tofinance their own development, an Asian Development Bankstudy found.   The study concluded that Southern Asian countries mustimprove their economic policies and capabilities to mobilizedomestic resources, and urged help in doing this from globallending agencies.   Because outside financing prospects world-wide are lesspromising, the study said, a greater role is justified formultilateral financial institutions, because they givegreater weight to development criteria in allocating funds.   The ADB said multilateral lenders can help Southern Asiancountries partly by setting financing priorities and usingcofinancing to attract more private capital.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          The European Community Commission unblocked 1.02 billion($1.8 billion) of EC aid to redevelop British areas inindustrial decline, including coal mining regions, afterLondon adopted new funding allocation rules. . . . Latviabegan a week without newspapers and magazines. To prod thegovernment in their paper shortage, publishers in the formerSoviet republic said the suspension is meant to dramatizetheir inability to import newsprint from Russia, owing tohigh customs duties, and to buy abroad because of a lack ofhard currency.</TEXT></DOC>
