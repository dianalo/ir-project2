SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan's men are dropping hints thatthe president is ready to hit the campaign trail on George Bush'sbehalf after a hoped-for triumphal return from the Moscow summit.   Yet no matter when Reagan makes his choice known, hisinvolvement in the Bush campaign must walk a careful line. It'spossible Reagan's involvement could overshadow rather than enhancethe vice president's effort.   ``The president will help the vice president in any way, shapeor form,'' predicted Ed Rollins, Reagan's former political adviser.``But it's got to be George Bush ... who lays out the Bush agenda.''   ``We'd love to see Ronald Reagan campaign for George Bush,''said Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the House Democratic Whip.``Reagan's strength is his personality and that's not George Bush'sstrength. On the stump, Reagan would make Bush look weak.''   Reagan has been meticulous about maintaining an officialneutrality. Now that Bush has nearly racked up enough delegates tobe the nominee, the White House has given notice Reagan is itchingto take a more active role.   ``He's ready at the drop of a hat to get out there on theroad,'' spokesman Marlin Fitzwater announced last week.   Taking note of Bush's string of primary and caucus victories,Fitzwater said he wanted to raise the possibility that Reagan willabandon his pledge to campaign only after a nominee had been chosenat the Aug. 15-18 GOP convention in New Orleans.   ``I think that in view of the way the campaign has developed ...we could see the president involved in some political activitiesbefore the nominating convention, activities that are directlyassociated with the nominee,'' Fitzwater said.   But another White House aide, speaking privately, said Reaganrealizes he will be a target in the campaign and he will not make astep until Bush asks him.   ``Clearly a lot of dialogue this fall will focus on us, with theDemocrats attacking our record and the vice president supportingit,'' the official said. ``Anything we do will be carefullycoordinated with the vice president.''   White House political director Frank Donatelli refused tospeculate on what form Reagan's activities might take.   But he said Reagan will not take part in any ``activecampaigning'' until after the summit with Soviet leader MikhailGorbachev. The meeting is scheduled for the second week of June.   Rollins, who most recently worked on Jack Kemp's failed bid towin the nomination, said that will be ``the perfect time'' forReagan to designate his successor.   ``He'll come back riding high in the polls; he'll be as popularas he's ever been,'' said Rollins.   However, Rollins warned that the stature of the presidency couldwork against Bush, as well as help him.   ``Bush needs to put his own stamp on his campaign,'' Rollinssaid. ``If Reagan is the one who gets into the debate with theDemocrats in the fall, he could overshadow Bush.''   Both Rollins and Donatelli contend that Reagan's involvementwill help focus, not fuzz, the Republican nominee's message.   ``Ronald Reagan might not be able to determine the future, buthe can define the present, and that's an important contribution tomake to the dialogue,'' Donatelli said, pointing out that Reaganhas referred repeatedly to the strength of the economy and lowunemployment.   But Rollins warned that some favorite Reagan topics might wellbe avoided.   ``If the two of them go out and talk about the line-item vetoand the economic bill of rights, they'll bore everybody to death,''he said.   And other issues, such as the Iran-Contra affair and EdwinMeese's legal difficulties, are likely to be ignored.   ``If he spends the next months talking defending everything he'sdone and anybody who's ever worked for him, he won't beeffective,'' Rollins said of Reagan.   It is just such issues that will attract voters to theDemocratic side, Coelho said.   He argued that American voters want a change and that Bush mustpresent himself as something different from Reagan. ``But when thepresident goes out for him, it clouds Bush's message. Reagan is the`Great Communicator,' not Bush,'' the California Democrat said.   Coelho also argued that Reagan's approach to dealing with theSoviets is one that is ``personally identified'' with the presidentand that it has ``never transferred to George Bush.''   ``George Bush's resume is supposedly grounded on foreign policyas his forte and he hasn't shown that in eight years,'' Coelho said.   Coelho also pointed out that Reagan failed when he attempted inthe 1986 campaign to keep the Senate in GOP hands. Although thepresident campaigned for months, the Republicans lost eight seats.   ``We'd encourage such participation again,'' he added with alaugh.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Susanne M.
