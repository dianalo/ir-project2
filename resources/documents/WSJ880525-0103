All of the Big Three auto makers cut the size of rebates in their incentive programs when they expired May 11. General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. blamed the rebates for reducing first-quarter profits. Nonetheless, they all announced a new -- if trimmed -- round of incentives beginning May 12.    Truck sales, meanwhile, continued strong in mid-May, increasing 11.3%. Total vehicle sales, including imports sold by the Big Three, were up 3.8%.    GM was the only one of the Big Three to post a decline in car sales, but the drop -- 6.4% -- was steep enough to offset gains made by the other domestic auto makers.    Auto industry analysts said, however, that the overall sales drop doesn't mean much. &quot;This is just the normal decline in sales when one incentives program ends and another begins,&quot; said Ronald Glantz, an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. &quot;Sales will rebound in late May.&quot;    The eight major domestic auto makers sold 216,325 cars in the May 11-20 period, compared with 221,127 a year earlier. Cars sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.2 million, according to a U.S. Commerce Department formula. That was down slightly from the year-earlier pace of 6.3 million and well below the 7.6 million rate in early May. The average daily selling rate of cars in mid-May was 24,036, compared with 25,538 in early May and 30,846 in late April.    North American-made light truck sales were 128,679, up from 115,254 a year earlier. Total vehicle sales in mid-May were 359,239, compared with 346,249 a year earlier.    Ford's car sales were up 2.6% to 66,691 while GM's fell 6.4% to 104,330. At Chrysler, car sales rose 3.1%. E.T. Pappert, vice president of sales, partly attributed the company's increase in auto sales to demand for its K-cars, the Plymouth Reliant and Dodge Aries.    Among foreign-based auto makers building cars in the U.S., Toyota Motor Corp. showed the greatest strength in mid-May, with car sales rising 43.4% to 1,805.    Nissan Motor Corp. sales, meanwhile, were down 52.4% to 2,829.    Truck sales partly offset the decline in car sales. At Chrysler, sales of trucks were up 31.9%, because of demand for the company's Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager minivans and Jeep Wrangler and Cherokees. GM's domestic truck sales were up 10.5%.    Ford truck sales, which had been strong, dropped 2.4% during the period. Ford said the decline was partly due to a shortage of automatic transmissions.    ---           RETAIL U.S. CAR AND LIGHT TRUCK SALES-a                                1988       1987       x-%                             May 11-20  May 11-20     Chg.
