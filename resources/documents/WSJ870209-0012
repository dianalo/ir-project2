Parallel investigations are being conducted by KMG and a self-enforcement arm of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants into the possible role of the former auditor, Richard Bluestine, in the fraud case.    An institute official said that at least four lawsuits have been filed by Wedtech shareholders accusing KMG, the ninth-biggest U.S. accounting firm, with failing to discover fraud in its audits of Wedtech. The company filed Dec. 14 for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors.    Though accounting firms often are sued when their client companies encounter business problems soon after a clean audit, it's rare that outside auditors are questioned about receiving improper payments from client companies.    In the Wedtech case, KMG and an investigations arm of the institute are seeking to determine whether KMG's internal control systems were sufficient to detect any lack of auditor independence.    And Manhattan district attorney Robert M. Morgenthau's office is investigating to determine whether Mr. Bluestine's independence was compromised when he accepted in 1983 stock and loans from the Bronx-based defense contractor and maker of pontoons, spare parts and small engines.    Mr. Bluestine, who joined the accounting firm of Grant Thornton here six months ago, hasn't been charged with any crime.    KMG said Mr. Bluestine was the engagement partner on the Wedtech audit when he resigned from KMG on Sept. 6, 1983, to join Wedtech. Prior to his resignation, KMG certified Wedtech's prospectus for a public stock offering in August 1983, according to both KMG and Mr. Morgenthau.    Wedtech officials have admitted that they falsified invoices in seeking reimbursements from the government and to obtain added contracting business. They also admitted bribing city officials.    Mr. Morgenthau has said that during 1983 Mr. Bluestine got $1.5 million in Wedtech stock and $900,000 in low-interest loans from Wedtech.    Yesterday, Mr. Morgenthau said that Mr. Bluestine agreed to obtain the stock and loan prior to leaving Main Hurdman. He also said that in January 1983, months before Mr. Bluestine joined Wedtech, Mr. Bluestine went to Japan with two Wedtech officials to help the company sell a license for a coating process.    According to Mr. Morgenthau, Mr. Bluestine paid for the air transportation of the two Wedtech officials and himself and later was reimbursed for the entire amount, including his own fare. Under professional ethics rules, an independent auditor is forbidden from accepting gifts or money beyond his firm's fee for the audit.    Several telephone messages left for Mr. Bluestine at his Long Island, N.Y., home weren't returned by him, nor could his attorney be reached. But his wife said: &quot;There are two sides to every story and the other side will surface with a lot of stuff coming out.&quot;    John Thompson, chairman of KMG, said the firm discovered some irregularities in Wedtech's books in 1983 while Mr. Bluestine was Wedtech's auditor. &quot;We reported these to the company and its outside legal counsel,&quot; he added.    Another KMG official said Wedtech's legal counsel, Biaggi andamp; Ehrlich, told KMG at that time that Wedtech had discussed the irregularities with the proper government officials and assured KMG the irregularities would be stopped.    Earlier this month, Bernard C. Ehrlich, a partner at Biaggi andamp; Ehrlich, was indicted in a state court in Manhattan on charges of bribing a state official on behalf of Wedtech. He pleaded innocent.    Wedtech discharged KMG as its auditor in mid-1985 and switched to Touche Ross andamp; Co. KMG officials said another former KMG employee, Anthony Guariglia, left the firm in June 1983 to join Wedtech. Mr. Guariglia, who became Wedtech's president and chief financial officer, along with other former top Wedtech officials, pleaded guilty last week to bribing a city official and misappropriating money from Wedtech.    Peter Skomorowsky, managing partner of the New York office of Grant Thornton, where Mr. Bluestine now works, said Mr. Bluestine has told Grant Thornton &quot;he firmly believes he is innocent&quot; of any wrongdoing. </TEXT></DOC>
