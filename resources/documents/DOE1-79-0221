Thatprocess includes the development of physical and human infrastructure,economic growth, distribution of resources, and the maturation of society(including its ability to weather crisis, whether it be social or economic).Though it is by no means exhaustive on the subject of development inSaudi Arabia, this study focuses on Aramco's involvement in the socio-economicelements of development in Saudi Arabia, as these are the direct impactsof development upon which the Saudi five-year development plans focus.Employing the theoretical framework of dependent development as adaptedby Timothy Luke to the OPEC countries' development experience in theinternational energy regime, this study serves in part as an in-depthcase study of Luke's thesis.</TEXT></DOC>
