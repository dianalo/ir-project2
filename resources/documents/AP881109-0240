Since June, the officials said, the communist guerrillas havemoved all but 1,000 of 9,500 refugees from the camp of Ta Luan inThailand's eastern Trat province to a new camp on the Cambodianfrontier several miles away.   Several thousand other refugees were moved to the border from theO'Trao-Natrao camp in northeast Surin province.   With aid officials watching, guerrillas transferred everythingfrom Ta Luan in Chinese-supplied trucks _ entire houses, even papayatrees. They left behind a ghost village of ``the crippled, theblind, the amputees,'' said one Western official, who like othersources spoke on condition of anonymity.   On Aug. 27, aid officials declared a medical emergency at Ta Luanupon finding, one source said, ``160 patients, 45 of them seriouslyill, and a 15-year-old medic in charge.'' The Khmer Rouge has barredrelief officials from the new site, saying it is ``too dangerous.''   However, one official said a Thai military officer who visited ita few days ago ``was shocked. Conditions were desperate. They had nomedical facilities and it was in a very malarious area.''   According to refugees who managed to flee, the area is minedtoward the Thai border to prevent escape. In recent days somerefugees have been allowed back to Ta Luan's medical clinic. Mosthave malaria.   Aid officials say the movement of the refugees is aimed atstrengthening the Khmer Rouge's position as the world communitytries to isolate it.   The Khmer Rouge, with 40,000 Chinese-armed troops, is thestrongest of three guerrilla groups fighting Vietnamese forces thatinvaded Cambodia in late 1978. The invasion ended a three-year KhmerRouge dictatorship that killed hundreds of thousands of people inslave labor camps and torture chambers.   After fleeing to Thailand, the Khmer Rouge set up camps wherereportedly they hold refugees from the war as virtual prisoners.   Aid officials have reported nighttime executions of refugees andforced porter duty on battlefields.   ``We are regularly in receipt of firsthand reports of bizarreviolations of human rights'' in these camps, Y.Y. Kim, recentlyretired director of the U.N. Border Relief Operation, told aiddonors in June.</TEXT></DOC>
