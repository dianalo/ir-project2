Robert Abboud.    The bailout could become the second costliest in U.S. history after the 1984 federal bailout of Continental Illinois Corp. The Abboud group said it would raise at least $500 million from common and preferred stock offerings to bolster First City's withering capital base. Together with the federal assistance, that would make the total First City infusion total nearly $1.5 billion.    Mr. Abboud said he plans to buy $5 million of the stock in the public offering.    Upon completion of the bailout, Mr. Abboud, 58 years old, would become First City's chairman and chief executive officer, returning the former First Chicago Corp. chairman to the top of a major banking holding company with $12.2 billion in assets and 61 Texas banks. Mr. Abboud was ousted by First Chicago's board in 1980 after gaining a reputation for being personally abrasive, yet financially conservative. He then joined Occidential Petroleum Corp. as president and chief operating officer and left in 1984 after a clash with Armand Hammer, the company's autocratic chairman.    First City's common shareholders' stake would be almost entirely wiped out under terms of the proposed agreement. Preferred holders' stake also would be greatly reduced. And long-term debt holders would face losses as well, though likely far less than the other securities holders. The proposal, which is subject to a definitive agreement and regulatory clearance, requires shareholder approval. But if they balk, First City would likely be declared insolvent and all holders would be entirely wiped out.    &quot;In terms of the stockholders and management, the bank has failed,&quot; declared L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., though for its customers it will be business as usual. &quot;This is no bailout for the old shareholders and the old bank managers,&quot; he added.    First City's plight reflects a history of weak managers who made some major strategic miscalculations that gave the bank a risky concentration in energy loans. Those loans took a beating with the drop in oil prices, and First City's total loan portfolio went from bad to worse when it tried to bail out its unprofitable energy loans with aggressive Texas real estate lendings that went sour.    The FDIC rescue, which was widely anticipated, would be in the form of a $970 million note to First City and won't initially involve cash, thus allowing the hardpressed agency to conserve its dwindling cash reserves.    The rescue of First City means that only two major Texas banking companies have avoided being taken over or bailed out: First RepublicBank Corp. and MCorp. The recession in the Southwest is producing record bank losses and failures in Texas, and analysts expect further bank consolidations if the institutions are to survive. &quot;This is the last of the sickest of the major banks,&quot; says Sandra J. Flannigan, a PaineWebber Inc. analyst in Houston. But, she adds, &quot;There will be more consolidation.&quot;    First City's problems underscore the severity of the recession in Texas, and is a blow to the stature of one of Houston's founding corporate families. First City's fortunes have been tied to Texas's booms and busts, and especially in Houston where the late Judge James A. Elkins, who served briefly as a county judge, founded the bank and a huge law firm. Together with the city's elite, he virtually ran Houston's civic, business and political affairs.    First City, once Houston's leading bank, was the lender of choice for Houston's energy businesses in the Sunbelt's boom years. In 1979, when oil prices were soaring, a poll of chief financial officers at mid-sized Texas energy companies said they preferred doing business with First City, which was nicknamed the &quot;ministry of finance for the petroleum business.&quot; Its total loan portfolio was growing at a compounded 20% annual rate, its profits were soaring and, says one former First City lending officer, &quot;we turned away twice as much business as we wrote.&quot;    But First City wound up making loans to some of the most troubled energy concerns in Texas. It concentrated more than a third of its energy lending in the rollercoaster fortunes of service and drilling companies. When the energy industry was growing, the loans were highly profitable, often yielding two or three points over the prime rate. But when oil prices fell in 1982 and exploration slowed, these companies -- some of them young and highly leveraged -- quickly ran into problems.    First City's energy loan portfolio reads like a Who's Who of troubled companies: Parker Drilling Co., Tulsa, Okla.; Blocker Energy Corp., Global Marine Inc. and Zapata Corp. all of Houston; Western Co. of North America, Fort Worth, Texas; and Penrod Drilling Co. and Placid Oil Co., held by the Hunts of Dallas and both in default on loans to First City totaling more than $80 million.    Some energy borrowers slipped into financial trouble as oil prices dipped, and First City tried to anticipate loan writeoffs. But one loan of about $50 million to Tosco Corp., a troubled Santa Monica, Calif., refiner, had to be restructured four times by First City. In the end, the bank wound up holding Tosco shares and the hope of collecting only about two-thirds of what it lent. &quot;We didn't provide for them before they hit the wall,&quot; says a First City lender.    In 1981, when the energy industry was still brimming with optimism, First City invited its energy borrowers to hear a group of Houston economists who forecast that oil prices would plummet to $15 a barrel by 1985. The energy people were angry at the bank for calling the session, recalls Randall E. Meyer, a First City lending officer. Another First City officer remembers one borrower standing up at the meeting and saying, &quot;If you guys are right, half of us are going to be bankrupt by 1985.&quot; Says the First City official, &quot;It was very prophetic.&quot;    The Houston bank tried to put the brakes on its energy lending by refusing loans to new customers, but that didn't limit the problems. And, says one former First City official, after refusing several potential borrowers, &quot;You'd get so gun shy that you found a couple of ways to accommodate&quot; others.    First City's managers believed that the road to recovery lay in real estate lending during Houston booming market. In 1982, its real estate lendings totaled a relatively modest $1.8 billion, or 19.2% of its portfolio. But at last June, those loans had climbed to about $3.2 billion, or 35.3% of its portfolio, the largest share. &quot;They built a real estate portfolio to earn their way out of the energy depression without regard to the fact that energy would have a broad impact around the state,&quot; says a former top First City executive.    On the west side of downtown Houston is one monument to First City's lending mistakes. First City and BankAmerica Corp. hold about 50% of a construction loan in excess of $100 million for Heritage Plaza, a 53-story, silver-glass and rose-colored granite office building capped with a pyramid sculpture that looks like a Mayan temple. The building opened this spring and is almost empty. Like many of First City's real estate loans, the project can't obtain permanent financing, so the banks are carrying the nonperforming loan after being forced to restructuring it.    Mr. Abboud's task is to resurrect a banking concern that has watched much of its corporate lending business dry up while accumulating net losses of about $563 million over the 18-month period that ended June 30. &quot;The offense begins today,&quot; Mr. Abboud told a meeting of First City officers in Houston yesterday, but he didn't give much public indication of his strategy for the bank.    Associates say Mr. Abboud is a detail manager, fond of seven-day work weeks. &quot;He didn't delegate a lot,&quot; says one. One First Chicago executive says Mr. Abboud's &quot;personal style was volatile.&quot; Adds the banker, who worked for -- and liked -- Mr. Abboud, &quot;He'd blow you off the map and then the next day praise you for something that didn't require praise. That was his way of apologizing.&quot;    The FDIC's Mr. Seidman said at a news conference in Washington yesterday that the agency investigated Mr. Abboud's record as a banker and concluded that he will &quot;do a sound and a good job.&quot; The Abboud group beat out at least three other bidders: MCorp, a big Dallas-based bank holding company that shares many of First City's problems, Bank of Scotland and an investment group led by Sheldon &quot;Red&quot; Mandell, a Chicago real estate investor and president of National Wrecking Co.    First City's senior chairman, J.A. Elkins Jr., the 67-year old son of the founder, put the bank on the auction block earlier this year when it became painfully clear that without a sudden economic rebound in Texas, First City couldn't save itself. For months, the bank cast about for investors but in the past month the FDIC seemed to take a stronger role in the process, often leaving First City executives in the dark. New management will be brought in under Mr. Abboud, the FDIC said, which is customary in federally assisted bank transactions. The FDIC has veto power over the officers and directors that Mr. Abboud may select.    The FDIC estimated that it would have faced a $1.8 billion payout if First City failed and the company was liquidated. As an alternative, it reviewed First City's loans and placed $1.79 billion of them in a &quot;spinoff&quot; bank to be managed by Mr. Abboud's team. The loans represent all of First City's nonperforming and 90-day past due loans.    In return for the possibly bad loans, First City's banking units would receive as much as $550 million in senior notes to be paid back by whatever the spinoff bank recovers on the nonperforming loans. The FDIC, in return for its $970 million note, would receive junior notes that would be paid down by whatever is left over from the proceeds of the spinoff bank after senior notes are repaid. At the worst, the FDIC estimates, it could face a total loss of between $800 million to $900 million because of the likelihood that many of the loans may prove uncollectable.    Terms of the complex transaction also call for Mr. Abboud and his New York investment bankers, Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. to issue at least $500 million of new stock -- $275 million of common and $225 million of preferred -- with at least half the preferred convertible into common. Buyers of these shares would own about 85% of First City while the FDIC's stake would be about 12.5%. Also, the Abboud group would raise an additional $86 million in capital for First City through a rights offering to the FDIC and current First City stockholders. Common stockholders would see their stake diluted to 1.3%.    Additionally, First City's preferred holders would get $30 million in cash for shares that have a current liquidation preference of about $174 million. Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, First City common closed at $1.625, down 25 cents. Its Series A and Series B adjustable preferred closed at $11.75, up 62.5 cents, and $11.50, up $1.25, respectively. In 1981, First City common reached a high of $41.25.    Given First City's steady deterioration, few of its major stockholders were suprised at the news. &quot;I don't see how they could do anything different from what they did,&quot; said an analyst for a firm holding more than one million shares of First City common. But, said Tony Kiem of Government Personnel Mutual Life Insurance Co., San Antonio, Texas, &quot;Our initial reaction is negative.&quot; As a large preferred stockholder, he said, &quot;I am not sure we want to be holding two or three pieces of paper for our shares.&quot;    ---             Ten Biggest Commercial Bank Collapses Continental Illinois Corp.
