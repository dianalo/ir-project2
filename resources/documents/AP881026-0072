Ships and helicopters searched the area today in hopes of findinghundreds more left missing when the 2,855-ton Dona Marilyn sankMonday with more than 500 people aboard.   A shipping executive said survivors struggled onto lifeboats orjumped overboard as the vessel heaved in the storm-whipped VisayanSea. It sank about 300 miles southeast of Manila.   ``Everybody was jumping into the sea,'' said Bernardo Cabigon,Tacloban station manager of Sulpicio Lines, which owned the DonaMarilyn. ``Others took the lifeboats. But there were so many peoplethat they decided to jump and swim. They looked very tired. Theystayed in the water for three hours.''   Cabrigon said 120 of the 143 survivors managed to reach thesmall, remote island of Almagro with lifejackets and life boats.   In Cebu, Sulpicio President Carlos Go said 13 other survivorswere found by rescuers on other islands and in the choppy seas.   There were unconfirmed reports scores of others may have reachedsafety on another island.   ``I'm expecting more survivors. We have not called offoperations,'' Cabigon said.   President Corazon Aquino ordered an investigation into thesinking. She also declared a state of calamity in Manila and 35provinces hardest hit by Typhoon Ruby, which killed at least 103people elsewhere in the Philippines Monday and Tuesday.   Last December, another Sulpicio ship, the Dona Paz, collided withan oil tanker off Mindoro island. Only 28 people survived, and morethan 3,000 were believed to have perished in the world's biggestpeacetime shipping disaster.   Cabrigon said the bodies of 26 victims washed ashore at Almagro.The coast guard said another body was found today in nearby waters.Almagro's mayor, Raul Escalante, said he had buried 18 of thedecomposing victims in a common grave.   The Dona Marilyn left Manila on Sunday bound for Tacloban but wasbuffeted Monday by strong waves and winds of up to 140 mph, Cabigonsaid. The coast guard said the skipper reported the vessel listingin heavy seas in a radioed distress signal before the ship went down.   Cabigon quoted survivor Alberto Oledo as saying he jumped fromthe stricken ship with his wife, son and daughter. The three heldhands but were separated in the raging seas, Cabigon said. Oledomanaged to reach Maripipi but there was no trace of his wife andchildren.   In a second, smaller rescue effort, the U.S. Navy said the USSBlue Ridge found four crewmen of the 300-foot Philippine freighterJet Nann Five, which sank about 150 miles south of where the Marilynis believed to have gone down.   A U.S. Navy spokesman at the Subic Naval Base said the Blue Ridgewas still searching for the vessel's 15 other crewmen. He quotedsurvivors as saying the Jet Nann Five capsized 12 hours afterleaving Cebu Sunday for Mindanao.   The Navy said the four were being treated for second-degreesunburn, dehydration and mild hypothermia.   The Philippine National Red Cross and other relief agencies said103 people were killed on land in the onslaught of the typhoon,which pummeled the entire archipelago nation with heavy rains andwinds Monday and Tuesday.   Ruby, now packing 93 mph winds, was reported heading today at 7mph west-northwest toward China. The Philippine Weather Service saidthe typhoon was about 240 miles northwest of Manila.   The Department of Social Services said 485,000 Filipinos were``affected'' by Ruby, meaning their homes were destroyed, damaged orflooded or sustained other losses.   Among the Ruby's fatalities on land were 26 people who drownedwhen a bus plunged into a swollen river on Panay island, the RedCross said.   The Department of Social Services reported 20 people were killedon Mindoro island, but gave no details. Most deaths during typhoonsin the Philippines are caused by drowning.   Other deaths were reported on Luzon and Mindanao, and authoritiessaid they expect the death toll to go up as communications wererestored and more reports came in from rural areas.</TEXT></DOC>
