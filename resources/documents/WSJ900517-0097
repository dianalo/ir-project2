Out in places like Prague, Riga,Mexico City and Moscow, democracies are being created, ideasare flying and national systems are being transformed. Backin Washington, the inheritors of the ConstitutionalConvention are spending the best years of their lives on . .. parental leave, Section 301, and carbon dioxide buildup inthe atmosphere.   So it's heartening to see the old juices flowing again.Democrats ripping Dick Darman. Another press run at JohnSununu's power. The smell of the White House putting the taxfat in the fire. Republicans gagging. Sunday-morning viewersabandoning the excitements of the Discovery Channel to watchthe talk shows again. But George Bush is a shrewd man, and wesuspect he knows that one of the great attributes of theAmerican political circus is that if you pull enough peopleunder the big top, a few may go off in a corner andaccomplish something serious -- such as getting a rope aroundthe out-of-control federal budget.</LP><TEXT>   The spending side of the federal budget has had quite arun 16 years to be exact. It began back in 1974 with passageof the ironically titled Budget Reform Act. One of the act'schief &quot;reforms&quot; was to eviscerate the President's rescissionauthority, or the power to trim back spending levels. Oneyear after the new budget law, spending as a percentage ofGNP had jumped from 19% to 21.8%. Except for 1979, it hasnever fallen below 21%. Yet on Monday, Senate BudgetCommittee Chairman Jim Sasser announced with the confidenceof a man who has been at it since 1977, &quot;The problem is notthe process. The problem is that revenues do not matchoutlays.&quot;   How ungrateful of the American people the past 16 yearsnot to convey tax payments equal to the spending commitmentsmade by Senator Sasser on their behalf. How irresponsible forthe citizenry to have created these deficits by voting in thelast three presidential elections for men who opposed raisingfederal receipts to cover the outlays of Senator Sasser'sblameless &quot;process.&quot;   In the accompanying chart, we depict the level of budgetreceipts collected by Washington since the end of World WarII (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ May 17, 1990). Notethat taxes today as a percentage of GNP are roughly at levelsseen only during the wartime periods of Vietnam and Korea.   Therefore we disagree emphatically with those members ofthe Washington establishment who, like former congressionalbudget office head Alice Rivlin, are now describing proposalsto reform the process &quot;mostly diversionary.&quot; Ms. Rivlin, likeSenator Sasser, simply wants taxes hiked. As to the spendingcuts, well, we all have read articles and heard calls on theTV talk shows for a gas tax, liquor tax, tobacco tax, salestax, VAT tax, user fees, pollution tax, popping the bubbleand taxing the rich. But has anyone read a single, serious,detailed article about spending cuts?   In fact, the Democratic delegates to the budget summitcame out of the White House Tuesday saying that they wantedthe President to go on national TV and propose spending cuts.News reports yesterday on the summit had the Democrats sayingthat the President had to take responsibility for financialsacrifices, and the President had to help them sell the harddecisions to their constituents.   Yet let anyone suggest that this same President shouldhave line-item veto authority or even enhanced rescissionpower and suddenly Senator Byrd is back on Mount Olympus:&quot;You eliminate the need for Congress.&quot; Senator Hatch: &quot;Itwould give the President an unprecedented power to playpolitics with the budget.&quot; Heaven forfend]   But of course it would allow the President to playhardball with the 535 members of Congress who for 16 yearshave pushed spending through &quot;omnibus appropriations&quot; and&quot;supplementals&quot; to its current level of $1.2 trillion.   Process reforms are not a diversion. They must be at theheart of any serious agreement to tame the deficit if thedeal is to withstand future assaults by Congress's spenders.   Finally, if the parties to this budget summit come awaywith a deal that raises taxes higher than current levels withno lasting institutional reform, then the case grows for aconstitutional 12-year limit on congressional terms.</TEXT></DOC>
