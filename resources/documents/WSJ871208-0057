RothschildWill Dismiss700 Employees---About 40% of Work ForceTo Be Affected in MoveBy the Ailing Concern---By Mathew Winkler and Steve SwartzStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> R SHE AXP IRE MERTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   L.F. Rothschild Holdings Inc., reeling from massive losses and recent difficulties in selling part of the 88-year-old Wall Street securities firm, will dismiss 700 employees, or about 40% of its work force, over the next six months.    In a move to improve the ailing concern's chances of remaining independent, Rothschild employees were informed that as many as 120 people throughout the 1,900-employee firm were being laid off imminently. The firm also said it is negotiating a transfer of its customer-clearing activities to Broadcort Capital Corp., a subsidiary of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., and will abandon the clearing business entirely.    At midyear, Rothschild had more than 2,000 employees. Since Oct. 19, when the stock market crashed, more than 100 people have been let go, including the entire municipal-bond department. Several top officers of the firm have left in recent months amid growing internal strife, including Matthew P. Dean, a managing director in charge of operations and 20-year veteran at Rothschild. Mr. Dean left the firm last week.    &quot;Let's face it, this is a major restructuring,&quot; said Andrew L. Berger, president of L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co., the brokerage and investment-banking subsidiary of the parent company.    While Mr. Berger didn't rule out a possible merger or sale of Rothschild Holdings in the future, he said the firm last week ended discussions with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. and Integrated Resources Inc. here over the sale of its retail-brokerage and clearing operations. &quot;There was a groundswell of support from our employees to keep the businesses,&quot; he said.    People familiar with the discussions among Rothschild, Shearson Lehman and Integrated Resources said Rothschild's decision to remain independent was motivated less by strategy and more by the fact that Rothschild couldn't get the price it sought.    During the Thanksgiving weekend, Rothschild's investment bankers at Salomon Brothers Inc. reached an agreement to sell Rothschild's retail brokerage network to Shearson Lehman, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. The transaction called for Rothschild to receive $16.5 million in cash and a small percentage of the business that its brokers generated for Shearson.    Just before papers were signed, however, Rothschild's co-chief executive officer, Robert Schoenthal, pulled the deal off the table, people familiar with the talks said. Mr. Schoenthal reportedly thought he could negotiate a better deal with Integrated Resources, which he believed was willing to buy not only the retail branch offices but also the back-office support staff, which Shearson wasn't willing to include.    But Integrated backed away early last week. &quot;We had been talking to Rothschild about both the clearing operation and the retail operation last week,&quot; said David R. Fluhrer, a spokesman for Integrated Resources, which operates money-management, life-insurance and limited-partnership concerns. &quot;But as of now, we're not talking to them.&quot;    Rothschild went back to Shearson, but Shearson was in the final stages of buying E.F. Hutton Group Inc. and its 6,500 retail brokers. Shearson Chairman Peter A. Cohen told Rothschild that any deal would now have to be struck at a much lower price, and Rothschild thought a big drop in price was unacceptable.    Mr. Berger said &quot;no agreement was reached&quot; between Shearson Lehman or Integrated Resources. &quot;There may well have been discussions about (acceptable) prices, but it was our decision not to pursue the Shearson and Integrated approaches because our employees were against them.&quot; Nevertheless, Mr. Berger and Rothschild Chief Executives Francois Mayer and Mr. Schoenthal aren't ruling out further restructuring of the firm in the form of another asset sale or merger.    &quot;No public company can put itself in a position where it doesn't listen to things proposed to it,&quot; Mr. Berger said.    Mr. Cohen of Shearson Lehman couldn't be reached for comment.    Rothschild's decision to transfer its clearing operation to Merrill Lynch will enable it to free about $30 million of its capital that currently is required to support such activities. The announced staff cuts could provide a further $20 million in savings for the firm, its officials said. As of Thursday, Rothschild had $228 million of capital, including $143 million of stockholders' equity.    But several analysts and some Rothschild managing directors said they doubt whether the firm can remain independent without substantial further cuts. Rothschild &quot;is slowly bleeding to death,&quot; said Perrin Long, a securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities Corp. &quot;I wouldn't be surprised if (Mr.) Schoenthal,&quot; who orchestrated much of the firm's expansion the past two years, &quot;is eased out. I expect (Rothschild) to lose about $20 million this year, or $1.25 a share.&quot;    Messrs. Schoenthal, Mayer and Berger said that their jobs are secure and that there would be no changes of top management at the firm. They also said the firm's status as one of only 40 concerns that report daily to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a so-called primary dealer of government securities confirms its financial health.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, L.F. Rothschild, which isn't connnected to a similarly named securities firm, Rothschild Inc., closed yesterday at $4.625 a share, down 62.5 cents.    In March 1986, investors snapped up L.F. Rothschild's $156 million initial public offering at $20.50 a share. But the firm has been a big disappointment since then. Last year, it earned only $498,000 on revenue of $401 million. In October, the firm posted a $44 million loss for the month. In 1985, its net income was $22.3 million on revenue of $317.2 million.    The firm, formed in 1899 as L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co., merged in 1977 with C.E. Unterberg Towbin Co., which was founded in 1932. The merged company surged to prominence in the early 1980s underwriting emerging high-technology companies. In 1983, for example, it was lead underwriter for 63 debt and equity issues valued at $2.1 billion, and it was the top underwriter of new high-technology issues, with 18, according to IDD Information Services Inc., New York.    Since then, however, Rothschild has lost some of its underwriting clout. Last December, Thomas I. Unterberg and A. Robert Towbin both left the firm in a major policy disagreement over a push into fixed-income trading. About Rothchild's current turmoil, Mr. Towbin, now a senior official of Shearson Lehman, said: &quot;I'm sort of sad about the way the whole thing is going. Unfortunately, I have to sit and watch.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
