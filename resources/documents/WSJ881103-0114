The 31-count indictment stemmed from the government's investigation of the &quot;Yuppie Five&quot; insider-trading case, which began in 1986. In that case, four young Wall Street professionals and a client of one of them pleaded guilty to using information stolen from the New York law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrison to make illegal profits. None of those people were named as defendants in yesterday's indictment.    The three individuals named in yesterday's indictment, announced by Rudolph Giuliani, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, were Ronald Yagoda, a former top arbitrager at Schloss; Mr. Teicher, formerly an arbitrager at Edward A. Viner andamp; Co., who now runs his own firm; and Ross S. Frankel, who until yesterday was head of arbitrage research for the New York firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    All of the defendants said they would plead not guilty to the charges. Marcus Schloss said it does not believe the charges will affect its performance as a specialist firm on the New York Stock Exchange. Specialist firms make markets in specific stocks to ensure smooth trading.    As previously reported, Marcus Schloss last February agreed to pay $410,700 to settle civil insider-trading charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the SEC's investigation of the Yuppie Five. At the same time, the SEC also brought civil fraud charges against Mr. Yagoda, accusing him of trading on inside information in five stocks.    Without admitting or denying guilt, Marcus Schloss had agreed to give up $136,900 in allegedly illegal trading profits and also to pay penalties of twice that amount. Mr. Yagoda is fighting the charges brought by the SEC against him. As previously reported, the SEC's continuing investigation has also focused on Mr. Teicher, who runs an arbitrage firm.    Andrew Solomon, a former securities analyst at Marcus Schloss who was a member of the Yuppie ring, pleaded guilty in 1986 to trading on inside information for the firm. Mr. Solomon said at the time of his plea that senior Schloss officials were aware of his trading.    Individuals familiar with yesterday's charges said the illegal activities Mr. Frankel is accused of having committed have nothing to do with the government's continuing investigation of Drexel and several of its employees. As previously reported, the SEC in September accused Drexel, its junk-bond chief, Michael Milken, and others of charges related to insider trading and securities fraud in connection with 18 deals. None of those deals were mentioned in yesterday's indictment.    A Drexel spokesman said that Mr. Frankel asked for -- and was granted -- a leave of absence from the firm yesterday to defend against the charges. The spokesman said the firm finds the charges against its employee &quot;disturbing,&quot; and says Drexel &quot;has been informed (Mr. Frankel) intends to plead not guilty.&quot;    The indictment alleges that from October 1985 to April 1986 the defendants conspired with the &quot;Yuppie Five&quot; ring. Mr. Giuliani declined to estimate how much money the defendants allegedly made as a result of that involvement.    According to the indictment, the defendants used information stolen by Michael David, formerly an associate at Paul Weiss and a member of the &quot;Yuppie Five,&quot; to trade in securities of Union Carbide Corp., American Can Corp., Allegheny International Inc., Avondale Mills and American Brands Inc.    The indictment also alleges that Robert Salsbury, another member of the ring and a former arbitrage analyst at Drexel, was directed by Mr. Frankel to tell Mr. Teicher the identities of four companies placed on Drexel's confidential &quot;phantom&quot; list. That list identified companies involved in corporate takeovers or potential takeovers, including Republic Airlines, Westchester Financial Services Corp., Western Union Corp. and Warnaco Inc.    The indictment alleges that an unnamed co-conspirator employed at Ivan F. Boesky andamp; Co. gave Mr. Teicher, 37 years old, information relating to the investment positions held by Mr. Boesky, the former stock arbitrager who was convicted on insider-trading charges. According to the indictment, Mr. Teicher allegedly traded on the information and passed it to others.    The indictment also charges that Mr. Frankel, 32, and Mr. Yagoda, 44, committed perjury and obstruction of justice when they testified before the SEC in 1986, and that Mr. Frankel further attempted to obstruct the SEC's investigation when he directed a co-conspirator at Drexel to destroy certain documents.    ---   Laurie P.
