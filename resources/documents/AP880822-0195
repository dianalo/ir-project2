There were no reports ofinjuries,'' said a supervisor at the O'Hare tower who would not beidentified by name.   He said the Boeing 727 landed without incident at 2:48 p.m. CDT.He was uncertain how far out of Chicago the aircraft was when itdeveloped problems.   ``They took off and they had a bad flap indicator,'' said MortEdelstein, spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration.   The reporters had covered the vice president's campaign stop inChicago, and were flying to Bush's next campaign stop at Spokane,Wash., authorities said.   Edelstein said the decision to dump fuel while the plane circledover Lake Michigan preparing for an approach to O'Hare was routine.   ``It's a precaution. When you make an emegency landing you don'twant to come in loaded, heavy with fuel,'' Edelstein said.   The plane was chartered from Key Air, based in Rosslyn, Va.,said Missy Compton, a spokeswoman in Bush's Washington campaignoffice.   ``It went back to Chicago. They have mechanics there in Chicagowho are going to work on the plane,'' she said.   Key Air officials decided Monday evening to ground the plane,and the reporters proceeded to Spokane on another aircraft,Edelstein said.   Key Air Vice President Scott Andrews said the flap problem wasnot serious and that the plane could have flown to Spokane if thecaptain had chosen to do so, though at a reduced altitude and speed.   Andrews said the flaps on the plane's wings failed to go back totheir normal position after takeoff.   The incident was the second malfunction in the plane in threedays, Andrews said.   During Bush's trip to Ohio over the weekend, smoke entered thejet's cabin as the aircraft landed at Port Columbus InternationalAirport. Airport officials said a hose came loose and allowed asmall amount of smoke to leak, but said the problem was minor. Theplane continued from Columbus to Cleveland on Saturday withoutincident, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
