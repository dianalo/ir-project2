Leroy A. Judge, a Hilton vice president, told a securities firm meeting in New York the parties probably would begin settlement discussions soon. Later, Mr. Judge said he didn't speak for Mr. Hilton when he made his remarks at the New York meeting. &quot;This is strictly Mr. Hilton's affair, and those remarks were my personal feelings,&quot; Mr. Judge said. Mr. Hilton was unavailable for comment Friday.    Final arguments in the case before a California state appellate court ended Feb. 4, Mr. Judge said; Beverly Hills, Calif.based Hilton Hotels is not a party to the litigation, he added.    Mr. Hilton claims an option in the will of his late father, Conrad N. Hilton, gives him the right to purchase the 27.4% stake for $24 a share, or about $165 million, its value at the time of Conrad Hilton's death in 1979. The stake was bequeathed to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, which primarily benefits Catholic nuns world-wide.    Hilton's stock has been edging upward in recent weeks, fueled by Wall Street speculation that the company might sell some prime assets or even be acquired by a foreign concern after the suit over the Hilton will is resolved. Hilton's stock closed Friday at $89.25, off $1 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, placing the value of the disputed 6.8 million shares at about $607 million. </TEXT></DOC>
