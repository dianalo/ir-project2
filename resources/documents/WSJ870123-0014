The bond market's slump occurred despite West Germany's reduction of its discount rate and a U.S. government report that economic growth slowed to an anemic 1.7% annual pace in last year's fourth quarter.    Some 30-year Treasury bonds dropped about a quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount, in a session shortened by a massive snowstorm on the East Coast. U.S. government securities markets closed at about 3 p.m. EST.    Most short-term interest rates were little changed.    The bond markets' lethargy contrasted sharply with the euphoria that gripped the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared more than 51 points, its largest one-day gain ever, to close at 2145.67.    Late yesterday, after the close of the Treasury markets, the Federal Reserve System reported an unexpectedly huge $14.9 billion plunge in the nation's money supply for the week ended Jan. 12. Still, the money supply has grown at a sizzling pace in recent months, prompting concern among some analysts that it could eventually overstimulate the economy and result in renewed inflationary pressures.    Until recently, analysts expected the Federal Reserve System to push interest rates down soon to bolster the economy. But the dollar's weakness probably will delay an easier credit policy at least a month or two, these analysts now say.    Also, dealers are concerned that the dollar's plight will make foreign investors reluctant to add to their holdings of dollar-denominated investments. They are especially nervous because the government is scheduled Wednesday to announce details of a huge financing, expected to total between $27 billion and $30 billion of new notes and bonds.    Foreigners &quot;will cut back their buying&quot; of Treasury securities, said Lawrence N. Leuzzi, economist at S.G. Warburg Securities Inc. He estimated that the government's quarterly financing package will total about $29.75 billion, consisting of $10.25 billion of three-year notes, $10 billion of 10-year notes and $9.5 billion of 30-year bonds.    The economy is &quot;very weak&quot; and will weaken further this quarter, Mr. Leuzzi said. But the fragile dollar will prevent the Fed from taking steps to stimulate business activity until March or April at the earliest, he said.    The Commerce Department's report yesterday of 1.7% economic growth in last year's fourth quarter was lower than most analysts had expected. Many economists in several surveys earlier this week had estimated fourth-quarter growth at about 2.5%. In the third quarter, the economy grew at a 2.8% pace, after adjusting for inflation. Mr. Leuzzi predicted that the economy this quarter will expand at only a 1% rate, &quot;at best.&quot;    In the credit markets, afternoon activity slowed to a crawl as the snowstorm enveloped the Northeast.    The Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 declined slightly to 101 28/32 from 102 3/32 Wednesday. That raised the yield to 7.34% from 7.32%. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 declined to 101 22/32 from 101 25/ 32, raising the yield to 7.01% from about 7%    Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills were littlechanged. The rate on the latest 13-week bill rose slightly to5.37% bid from 5.35% Wednesday, while the latest 26-weekissue wound up unchanged at 5.31% bid.   The federal funds rate hovered just above 6% most of the day. On Wednesday, the rate on overnight loans of reserves between banks averaged 6.07%.    The Federal Reserve estimated that M1 plummeted to a seasonally adjusted average of $734.4 billion in the week ending Jan. 12 from $749.3 billion the previous week. The drop is believed to be the largest one-week decline in the basic money measure. Still, M1 remains $10.6 billion above the upper limit of the Fed's target range, which calls for 3% to 8% growth this year. The measure consists of checking deposits plus cash held by the public.    Other figures released by the Fed showed that commercial and industrial loans on the books of the 10 leading New York City banks dropped $1.78 billion in the week ended Jan. 14, compared with a $146 million decline the previous week. The drop brought the total of such loans outstanding to $65.09 billion.    The corporate front received several new issues, including RJR Nabisco Inc.'s $500 million offering of sinking-fund debentures. Lead underwriter was Dillon, Read andamp; Co. The 8 3/8% debentures due 2017 were priced at 97.375 to yield 8.62%. They are rated single-A-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and single-A by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Other offerings included:   --General Motors Acceptance Corp.'s $300 million of notes, issued through a group led by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. The 7 1/8% notes due 1992 were priced at 99.775 to yield 7.179%. They are rated double-A-1 by Moody's and double-A by Sandamp;P.    --American Express Credit Corp.'s $200 million of senior notes. A group led by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. priced the 7 3/8% seven-year notes at 99.6 to yield 7.45%. They are rated double-A-2 by Moody's and double-A by Sandamp;P.    --Kidde Inc.'s $50 million of senior notes. Lead underwriter was Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. The 8 1/2% notes, priced at par, are rated Baa-2 by Moody's and triple-B by Sandamp;P.    In the municipal market, yields and maturities on portions of a $388.7 million revenue-bond offering by the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority were changed by a group led by PaineWebber Inc. Under the new terms, yields range from 4% in 1988 to 7% in 2014. Previously, the scale ranged from 4% to 7.017%. </TEXT></DOC>
