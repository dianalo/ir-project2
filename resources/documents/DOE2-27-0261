<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-27-0261 </DOCNO><TEXT>A gyrokinetic formalism using magnetic coordinates is used to derive self-consistent,nonlinear Maxwell-Vlasov equations that are suitable for particle simulationstudies of finite-{beta} tokamak microturbulence and its associated anomaloustransport. The use of magnetic coordinates is an important feature ofthis work as it introduces the toroidal geometry naturally into our gyrokineticformalism. The gyrokinetic formalism itself is based on the use of theAction-variational Lie perturbation method of Cary and Littlejohn, andpreserves the Hamiltonian structure of the original Maxwell-Vlasov system.Previous nonlinear gyrokinetic sets of equations suitable for particlesimulation analysis have considered either electrostatic and shear-Alfvenperturbations in slab geometry, or electrostatic perturbations in toroidalgeometry. In this present work, fully electromagnetic perturbations intoroidal geometry are considered. 26 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
