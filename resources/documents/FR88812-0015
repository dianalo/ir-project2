First, the proposedconsent offers more relief than would be obtained in its absence. Second,the proposed consent appears to contain relief that is far from trivial.</ITAG>I will examine closely any submissions received by the agency during thepublic comment period before deciding what, if any, further action to take.<ITAG tagnum="85">Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment</ITAG>The Federal Trade Commission has provisionally accepted an agreement containinga proposed consent order with Magnolia Partners, L.P. (``Magnolia''), WestPoint-Pepperell, Inc. (``West Point''), and The NTC Group, Inc. (``NTC''),collectively referred to as ``respondents.''On July 29, 1988, the Commission entered into an agreement containing theproposed consent order with Magnolia, West Point, and NTC in settlementof a proposed complaint challenging the acquisition of the voting securitiesof J.P. Stevens, Inc. (``J.P. Stevens'') by Magnolia. Magnolia is a limitedpartnership controlled by West Point, with a subsidiary of NTC as a limitedpartner. The proposed complaint states that the Commission has reason tobelieve that, in the absence of an adequate divestiture of certain J.P.Stevens assets to NTC, the acquisition of J.P. Stevens voting securitiesby Magnolia (the ``Acquisition'') would violate Section 7 of the ClaytonAct and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The proposed complaintspecifically alleges that the Acquisition may substantially lessen competitionin the manufacture, distribution, and sale of towels, and in the manufacture,distribution, and sale of sheets.To remedy the alleged anticompetitive results of the Acquisition, the agreement'sproposed consent order would (among other things) require Magnolia to sell(``divest'') certain of J.P. Stevens' towel-making and sheet-making assets,including: (a) J.P. Stevens' Roanoke Plants Nos. 1 and 2, Patterson Plant,Rosemary Plant and Delta Finishing Plant No. 4, all of which are towel-makingfacilities located in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina; (b) J.P. Stevens'Whitehorse Plants Nos. 1 and 2, which are sheeting-manufacturing facilitieslocated in Greenville, South Carolina; and (c) the Brookneal Finishingand Cut and Sew Plant located in Brookneal, Virginia. As described in greaterdetail below, the Commission may require West Point to add certain additionalassets to the divestiture package.The Commission has placed the proposed complaint and the provisionallyaccepted consent order on the public record for sixty (60) days so thatinterested parties may comment on it. The Commission is particularly interestedin the opinions of the public on the appropriateness of divesting the additonalassets described in Part VII of this agreement. Comments received duringthis period will become part of the public record, unless commenters requestconfidential treatment. Commenters desiring confidential treatment mustdo so by printing ``Confidential Treatment Requested'' across the top ofthe first page of their comments. After the end of the sixty day commentperiod, the Commission will review the proposed complaint and consent orderand the comments received thereon, and will decide whether it should withdrawfrom the consent agreement or make final the agreement's proposed consentorder.If the Commission withdraws from the agreement, it may: (1) Determine thatno relief is required; (2) attempt to negotiate with respondents and makenecessary modifications in the proposed consent order; or (3) initiatelitigation to compel West Point to divest certain assets or seek any otherrelief consistent with section 7b of the Clayton Act or section 5 of theFederal Trade Commission Act.In additon to provisional acceptance of the proposed consent order, theCommission has entered into an ``Agreement to Hold Separate'' with respondents.This agreement will maintain the separate identity and individual viabilityof J.P. Stevens during the public comment period. The proposed consentorder expressly makes the Agreement to Hold Separate a part of the consentorder.If, at the end of the comment period, the Commission believes further enforcementaction is warranted and withdraws from the proposed consent agreement,the Commission may seek any relief it deems appropriate, including a federalcourt order under section 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Insuch a court action, the Commission may request (among other things) anextension of the ``Hold Separate'' provisions in order to prevent any comminglingof J.P. Stevens' businesses or assets with West Point's until a final adjudicationon the merits of any administrative action the Commission may initiate.The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposedconsent order. It is not intended to constitute an official interpretationof the proposed complaint, consent order, or Agreement to Hold Separate,or to modify in any way their terms.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Consent Order</ITAG><T3>Part I</T3>The introductory paragraph of the proposed consent order defines the termsused in the order.\1\<NOTE/> Subpart (f) describes the J.P. Stevens ``Sheet and TowelAssets,'' and Subpart (G) defines an ``Eligible Person'' to which the Sheetand Towel Assets may be divested. The term ``Eligible Person'' includesNTC and its subsidiaries, so long as they acquire the Sheet and Towel Assetspursuant to a specified agreement betweeen West Point and NTC.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The proposed complaint also contains several definitionsof terms.<T3>Part II</T3>Part II of the proposed consent order provides that if respondents acquirea majority of J.P.
