StewartStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The federal judge who will sentence former arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky said the government believes Mr. Boesky's cooperation is the &quot;most remarkable&quot; in the history of the securities laws.    Federal District Court Judge Morris E. Lasker, who is scheduled to sentence Mr. Boesky on Dec. 18, said in a pre-sentencing hearing last week that there has been &quot;enormous cooperation&quot; from Mr. Boesky.    &quot;When the United States attorney, who is not necessarily prone to do so, states that the cooperation in this case is the most remarkable, or whatever exact adjective (was) used, in the history of the securities laws and then spells out what it is, a judge can't help but take them into consideration,&quot; Judge Lasker said. He characterized the Boesky sentencing as &quot;a very difficult case for everybody involved.&quot; Mr. Boesky faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison.    While Judge Lasker's comments seemed to reflect considerable sympathy for Mr. Boesky's plight, they didn't include any promise of leniency. &quot;The offenses to which Mr. Boesky admits, rather than the ones to which he has pleaded guilty in particular, are very serious and the public at large, without knowing the details, considers them to be so,&quot; the judge said.    A transcript of the hearing was released by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan. Mr. Boesky paid $100 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges of insider trading and other securities law violations, and was later allowed to plead guilty to one felony in return for cooperating in the government's massive investigation of wrongdoing on Wall Street. Judge Lasker's remarks are the first judicial comment on the value to the government of Mr. Boesky's disclosures.    Although Mr. Boesky's sentencing has been delayed several times, representatives of both the U.S. attorney's office and Judge Lasker said they expect Mr. Boesky to be sentenced on Dec. 18. People familiar with the government's investigation said that the sentencing is going forward with Mr. Boesky's consent, because prosecutors have largely finished debriefing Mr. Boesky and are satisfied that he has lived up to his plea bargain.    Disclosures by Mr. Boesky have led to guilty pleas by Martin Siegel, a former takeover specialist at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., and Boyd Jefferies, former chairman of Jefferies Group Inc. Judge Lasker didn't provide details about who else Mr. Boesky has implicated, saying that &quot;it is not possible that the public know what that cooperation has been.&quot; But Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll, representing the government at the hearing, said Mr. Boesky has provided information about crimes that go far beyond insider trading.    Mr. Carroll said: &quot;The larger crimes in our view are the crimes that Mr. Boesky has engaged in largely at the behest of others . . . . There we are dealing with a very systemic type of problem. A systemic corruption that undermines the financial world, and that is not unfortunately an exaggeration.&quot;    Bruce Baird, the assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the Boesky investigation, declined to elaborate on Mr. Carroll's remarks. As previously reported, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and the head of its junk bond operations, Michael Milken, are being investigated, as are others, as a result of disclosures by Mr. Boesky. Drexel and Mr. Milken have denied any wrongdoing.    Mr. Boesky was present at the hearing, but made only one statement. &quot;I just want to say that I am deeply ashamed and I do not understand my behavior,&quot; he told Judge Lasker. &quot;I have spent the last year trying to understand how I veered off course. I would like the opportunity as I go forward to redeem myself and leave this Earth with a good name. That is what I want.&quot;    Mr. Boesky's lawyer at the hearing, Leon Silverman, a partner at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver andamp; Jacobson, said Mr. Boesky has been studying at the Jewish Theological Seminary and, under an assumed name, has been working with the homeless at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York.    Judge Lasker said of Mr. Boesky that &quot;I am prepared to believe that he is a reformed individual. I wish that were the end of the matter. It can't be and it isn't.&quot;    Defense lawyers said it is highly unusual for a defendant to be sentenced before he has completed his part of a plea bargain by testifying in any criminal trials resulting from his cooperation. Mr. Baird, however, said that the timing of sentencings &quot;depends on a lot of things&quot; and that it is impossible to generalize. He said the government is fully protected in the event Mr. Boesky later fails to deliver the testimony he has promised, since his entire plea bargain could be reopened and new charges could be filed against him. </TEXT></DOC>
