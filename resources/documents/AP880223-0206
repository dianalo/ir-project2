Jeff Musto, a spokesman for Teamsters Local 2747 representing6,500 Northwest attendants, said 94.4 percent of the more than5,000 attendants participating voted to strike Saturday. Strikeauthorization required a two-thirds majority.   ``The strike authorization of 94.4 percent reflects thedeplorable state of labor relations at Northwest Airlines,'' Mustosaid at a news conference, reading a statement prepared by thelocal.   ``Northwest Airlines labor relations does not comprehend theseverity of the labor situation at this carrier,'' the statementread.   Northwest spokesman Redmond Tyler said he was not surprised bythe strike vote and said the airline expected to continue operatingmost of its flights if a strike occurred.   Meanwhile Monday, the Teamsters union at Pan Am Corp. threatenedto disrupt the airline over a contract impasse but stopped short ofcalling a strike.   The strike deadline for the union, which represents 4,500 Pan Ambaggage handlers, reservations clerks and other ground personnel,passed at 12:01 a.m. Sunday. No negotiations were scheduled forMonday.   Teamsters officials said they would use tactics such as sendingbaggage to the wrong airports and canceling reservations.   Tyler said Northwest officials and the union would hold anegotiating session Tuesday ``with the cooperation of the NationalMediation Board and we continue to remain optimistic that ourcontract will be resolved.''   The two sides have not negotiated since the National MediationBoard released them from mandatory negotiations last month, whenthey deadlocked over wages, fringe benefits and work rules. A30-day cooling-off period ends at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday, at whichtime the attendants may strike and Northwest may impose a newcontract.   About 2,000 Northwest managers are qualified to be flightattendants and would be used during a strike, according to theairline, which also advertised earlier this month for flightattendants.   But Northwest last week told 5,300 mechanics and baggagehandlers they could be laid off if the flight attendants went onstrike.   The International Association of Machinists, which represents20,000 ground workers at Northwest, and the pilots' union have notsaid if they would honor a strike by the flight attendants.   In the last strike against Northwest, the machinists unionwalked out for 27 days in May 1982.   Northwest merged with the Minneapolis-based Republic Airlines in1986 and the company and its major unions have been involved intalks on new contracts ever since.   Many former Republic employees are paid less than theirNorthwest counterparts, a cause of friction between labor andmanagement.   Northwest's latest proposal to the Teamsters offers immediateelimination of pay gaps between former Northwest and formerRepublic flight attendants and deals with the other areas ofdisagreement.   The proposed five-year agreement calls for pay increases forformer Republic flight attendants ranging from 17 percent to 26percent, according to Terry Erskine, Northwest's vice president oflabor relations. Senior flight attendants earn about $35,000annually; starting pay is about $15,000 a year, he said.   But Musto said Monday that ``even though it does show a payraise for the Republic people, the end result would be a pay cut ifyou put a dollars and cents figure on things being taken away formthe Republic people.''   Musto said the proposal would mean less vacation pay and, ``inthe long run, you would get less retirement benefits.''</TEXT></DOC>
