The people who fired the rocket were Palestinian guerrillas in amountain above town. It was aimed at Israel, 1{ miles west ofHumayed's house on the northern end of the border. A second missileexploded harmlessly in an Israeli field.   A few days later, Humayed said, Israeli troops fired a flareonto the Jordanian side of the Yarmouk River, apparently to burnbrush guerrillas could use for cover. But instead the resultingfire burned 60 of his family's orange trees.   The missiles and several recent guerrilla attacks on Israel haveinterrupted years of relative calm along Jordan's 300-mile border,prompting veiled Israeli threats of retaliation if they continue.   The Palestinian attacks pose a security problem for Israel. Butfor Jordanians the issue has wider, strategic implications _survival against a more powerful foe.   A senior military official, who cannot be identified because ofJordanian army regulations, said the Jordanians are doing theirbest to stop the Palestinian attacks.   Twelve members of the Syrian-based Popular Front for theLiberation of Palestine were arrested after the rocket attack.   Military officials said the guerrillas who fired the Katyushascrossed from Syria, which takes a militant stand against Israel andsponsors hardline guerrilla factions.   At the same time, the guerrillas are hostile to efforts byJordan and Yasser Arafat's mainstream Palestine LiberationOrganization to reach a diplomatic settlement with Israel.   ``We don't believe this sort of action will solve thePalestinian problem,'' the Jordanian military official said. ``Ifthe Israelis retaliate, it might hurt our citizens.''   He suggested Syrian-backed radical Palestinians were trying toundermine Arafat's peace initiative.   Jordanians are alarmed by right-wing Israeli calls to establisha Palestinian state in Jordan or for Israel to take control ofJordanian territory under what they consider to be biblicalprecedent.   ``We take every word said by the Israeli leaders seriously ...because we've learned they mean it,'' the senior officer said.   Aqaba, Jordan's only port, along with its most importantfarmlands, water systems and potash industry are within Israeliartillery range.   All of Jordan's urban centers are only a few minutes' flyingtime from Israeli air bases.   Israeli jets regularly fly into Jordanian airspace, diplomatssaid. But the military official noted: ``Nobody has reported to methat the Israelis are trying to be aggressive against Jordaniansoldiers.''   Jordanian and Israeli policemen still meet on the KingHussein-Allenby Bridge on the Jordan River to coordinate the flowof tour buses that cross under the scrutiny of machinegunners inblockhouses.   Along much of the border, Israeli and Jordanian outposts areonly a few hundred yards apart.   Soldiers at a northern post overlooking the Golan Heightsvillage of Hammah can hear laughter and music from an Israeliamusement park nearby.   But the thunder of artillery from Israeli gunnery ranges, thesupersonic booms of Israeli warplanes and occasional explosions inborder minefields, sometimes triggered by wild pigs, bear witnessthat this is still a war zone.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday AMs, Nov. 13</NOTE></DOC>
