The passage of single heavy particlesthrough the cell nucleus is capable of producing multiple DNA double-strandscission and chromatin breaks. According to the Repair-Misrepair model,the high biological effectiveness of high-LET particles is due to misrepairand misrejoining of the breaks. The Bragg depth ionization effect allowsheavy particles to deposit considerably more energy deep in tissue thanat the surface, and this property has been used for great improvementsin the radiation therapy of localized tumors. Recent advances in producingradioactive beams will allow verification of therapeutic administrationof such beams. The radioactive beams also open a new field of NuclearMedicine. There is increasing interest in building special biomedicallight and heavy-ion accelerators. These will be used not only for therapybut also for diagnosis, for the study of radiation hazards in space flight,and for basic molecular and cellular understanding of the mechanismsof radiation effect.</TEXT></DOC>
