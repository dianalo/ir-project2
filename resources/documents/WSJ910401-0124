The upshot: Employees are less likely to feel pushed totake an offer than in the past. But they may also find theoffer less attractive than they expected.</LP><TEXT>   Big employers, stung by the recession, again hope to limitpainful layoffs by giving senior employees temporaryincentives to leave. Since last spring, over 20 big U.S.companies in hard-hit industries have opened early-retirementwindows.   From a morale standpoint, &quot;it's always better to getpeople out who are smiling and have chosen&quot; to go, saysRobert Foster, human-resources director at Grumman Corp., adefense contractor where almost 2,000 employees retired earlywith a slightly richer pension last fall.   In the auto industry, thousands of white-collar employeeshad to decide by last Thursday whether to accept Ford MotorCo.'s early-retirement offer. General Motors Corp. will giveolder blue-collar workers a similar special deal, unionofficials disclosed recently. And Chrysler Corp. plans toannounce a program this week, part of an effort to shed about3,000 nonunion jobs.   Incentives can include liberalized pension eligibility,enlarged pension benefits, extended health insurance andseverance pay. Today's packages, however, bear littleresemblance to those from the corporate cutbacks of the '80s.Companies are being more selective, less coercive and lessgenerous. Previous early-retirement offers often attractedtop performers and sparked costly age-bias suits fromemployees who felt squeezed out unfairly.   Companies &quot;learned from their mistakes,&quot; says Joe Perkins,corporate-retirement manager at Polaroid Corp. But &quot;it isstill risky water you are dealing with.&quot;   Employers have become pickier about who goes and whostays, often targeting early-retirement plans by geography,division, skills, even job titles. Among 50 of the largestU.S. companies, 11 opened a window last year, and all but onehad such limits, according to Wyatt Co., a consulting firm.Just six of 11 big companies with plans in 1989 actedselectively.   Broader plans sometimes backfire. A petroleum companyoffered early retirement and then had to shut a refinerytemporarily when nearly every worker at the power plantsupplying the operation accepted its offer, says D. QuinnMills, a Harvard professor of business administration. Somany West Virginia employees took early-retirementinducements in 1988 that the program cost the state $11million more than it saved. At Du Pont Co., 11,200 people --almost twice the number expected -- grabbed the company'snationwide offer in 1985, forcing the company to hire manyback as consultants.   Philadelphia Electric Co. devised one way to prevent sucha sudden exodus. Last spring, the utility gave an extra ninemonths' severance pay to 1,859 older employees who agreed tohave their early retirements staggered from November 1990 toDecember 1992. Takers represented roughly 17% of its workforce. &quot;If we lost all of them&quot; at once, says LindsayJohnston, assistant general counsel, &quot;we couldn't keep ourelectricity going.&quot;   Ford, which lost some people it wanted to keep to acompanywide incentive program in 1980 and 1981, is taking amore targeted approach this year. Its latest plan excludedemployees with scarce skills, such as electrical engineers.Ford also set precise ceilings for job categories it isseeking to trim in overstaffed operations, including itsfinancial-services group. If too many people have volunteeredfor the sweetener, the company will reject requests from theleast senior candidates.   The veto policy irritates some Ford employees. They saymanagement won't decide who can retire early until April 10-- only 20 days before they are due to leave. &quot;I don't thinkit's fair that you have to wait,&quot; says Ben Romolino, a58-year-old car designer. &quot;You can't go out and find anotherjob&quot; in the meantime. Three businesses are interested inhiring Mr. Romolino once he retires, but none will hold theirvacancies open long enough.   A Ford spokesman says Mr. Romolino isn't far off in sayinghe may not know until April 10. &quot;That may seem unfair,&quot; thespokesman says, &quot;but it's one of the realities of handlingthis thing on a location-by-location basis.&quot;   Some lawyers believe Ford's veto might triggerage-discrimination lawsuits by individuals who aren'tencouraged to stay. &quot;You run the risk&quot; someone will claim&quot;this wasn't a voluntary program&quot; and thus discriminatedagainst older workers, warns Mark Dichter, a partner withMorgan, Lewis andamp; Bockius, a management law firm based inPhiladelphia. Benefits consultants say people excluded fromoffers, such as Ford's electrical engineers, also may feelcheated and sue. Several hundred suits have challengedearly-retirement incentives over the past decade, mainly overthe coercion issue. A few led to multimillion-dollarsettlements.   Litigation fears plus a federal age-bias law passed lastfall are encouraging companies to be less coercive in makingearly-retirement offers. Employees receive counseling onmaking decisions, and more time to do so. Employers used togive as little as a week or two because they &quot;really wantedto play hardball and get things done quickly,&quot; says AllenSteinberg, a Hewitt Associates consultant. &quot;People {later}realized that was just a mistake.&quot;   A group of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. managerssued over a 1985 offer because they had only 15 days todecide on it. Though they lost their case, ATandamp;T generally nowkeeps early-retirement windows open for six to eight weeks.   Just over six weeks soon will become the national norm.Under the 1990 federal law, groups of workers must have atleast 45 days before they can abandon their rights to sue.The new statute also requires employers requesting waivers todisclose full details of their programs.   During an early-retirement offer four years ago,International Paper Co. simply asked employees to sign astatement saying they knew the deal was voluntary. This year,however, when the company introduced incentives at threesmall plants, it prepared a detailed but highly readablewaiver and strongly urged employees to consult an attorneybefore they signed. &quot;It's when {workers} feel rushed andpressured that the problems come up,&quot; says Joyce Margulies,the company's senior counsel for human resources.   Despite their bosses' greater care and candor, olderworkers still sue over earlyretirement offers. A group offormer International Business Machines Corp. employees filedsuit last month in Lexington, Ky., claiming they were misledinto taking early retirement. They say the company assuredthem in late 1989 and early 1990 that no better offer wouldcome -- even though last August, IBM made an offer nearlytwice as good as part of an agreement to sell the Lexingtonfacilities.   In a statement after the suit was filed, IBM expressedpride in &quot;its tradition of respect for the individual andfairness in all employee matters.&quot; A spokesman declines tocomment further on the suit.   By making the later offer more lucrative than earlierones, IBM swam against the tide. In fact, IBM itself revertedto a less generous offer last week with plans to cut its workforce by 10,000, partly through an early-retirement package.   Grim economic realities and rising medical costs aredictating stingier early-retirement offers these days.Packages provide less severance pay -- typically six months,rather than the year or two seen in the mid-'80s. Someemployers have stopped offering lifetime promises ofunchanged medical coverage. Others insist that departingemployees devote a bigger share of their pensions todependents' health insurance than in the past.   For Grumman, that move was an unlucky gamble. Less than athird of the 6,200 eligible employees took its offer lastfall. The defense contractor had predicted 50% would leave,and blames the difference partly on higher medical premiums.&quot;I felt I couldn't afford to take&quot; the offer, says FelixMancuso, a 60-year-old commodity manager. If he had retiredearly, his wife's medical coverage would have soared to $260a month from $20 -- a healthy chunk of his $1,600 monthlypension.</TEXT></DOC>
