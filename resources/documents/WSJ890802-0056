In a 5-to-1 ruling, the court limited the right of plaintiffs to seek damages based on an enhanced risk that cancer or some other disease might subsequently develop from exposure to toxic materials. Such claims won't be considered, the court said, unless a plaintiff can show a &quot;reasonable medical probability&quot; that he will later contract the disease -- an extremely difficult standard to meet.    The New Jersey court, ruling in a case involving exposure to asbestos, joined a number of other state and federal panels that have restricted the right of plaintiffs to seek damages for increased or enhanced risk of disease. Because some diseases don't show up for a long time after exposure to toxic materials, such claims have grown increasingly common in recent years, not only in asbestos cases but also in those involving exposure to various toxic chemicals.    &quot;There isn't a toxic product case I'm aware of in which this claim is not raised,&quot; said Gita F. Rothschild, an attorney in the Newark firm of McCarter andamp; English. She argued the case for the defendants, Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., Pittsburgh Corning Corp., Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. and Keene Corp. Pittsburgh Corning is owned by PPG Industries Inc. and Corning Glass Works.    The case was brought by Roger Mauro, a former repairman and plumber-steamfitter who was exposed to materials containing asbestos made by the defendants. A trial court permitted the jury to consider damage claims based on existing injuries, which included scarring of Mr. Mauro's lung lining, as well as his claim for emotional distress caused by fear of developing cancer. The jury returned a verdict of $7,500 against Owens-Corning, Pittsburgh Corning and Eagle-Picher, but nothing against Keene.    But the trial judge wouldn't let the jury consider Mr. Mauro's claim of increased risk of contracting cancer, because his expert couldn't show that it was &quot;probable&quot; that he would contract it. A state appeals court upheld the ruling and the Supreme Court affirmed the decision.    An attorney for Mr. Mauro couldn't be reached to comment.    In deciding to limit recognition of enhanced-risk claims, the court expressed concern that calculating fair compensation is already complicated enough without having to figure speculative damages. &quot;Inevitably damage awards would be rendered for diseases that will never occur, exacting a societal cost in the form of higher insurance premiums and higher product costs,&quot; the court said.    The court also asserted that such claims would increase the burden of litigating the already vast number of asbestos cases. Some 80,000 claims, seeking billions of dollars in damages, are pending and new ones continue to pour in. The court also concluded that plaintiffs in New Jersey can always sue for damages later on if a disease actually materializes. </TEXT></DOC>
