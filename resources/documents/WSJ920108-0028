While the Houston company's troubles are far from over,analysts said they are encouraged that October price cuts onCompaq's popular notebook computers spurred sales and that aweaker dollar helped international operations. In addition,institutions apparently have been big buyers of Compaq'sstock, which has risen 29% this year in heavy volume.</LP><TEXT>   Yesterday, Compaq closed at $34, up $3.125, on volume ofmore than two million shares in New York Stock Exchangetrading. Several analysts, who had been expecting Compaq toearn about 45 cents a share in the fourth quarter, said thecompany is leading them to believe that per-share earningsmight be in the range of 60 cents to 75 cents. Some analystsalso said they raised their sales estimates to about $850million from $800 million.   The collective sigh of relief is that &quot;things aren'tgetting worse for now,&quot; said Daniel Benton, technologyanalyst at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.   Indeed, even the better-than-anticipated results for thefourth quarter would be well below last year's results, whenCompaq had net income of $134.8 million, or $1.51 a share, onsales of $1 billion.   Yesterday, Compaq also said that its new portable computerfeaturing a top-of-the-line, 80486 microprocessor from IntelCorp. and an active-matrix color screen capable of producing4,000 colors is selling better than expected. While Compaqwouldn't be specific about its expectations, it said it hassold &quot;thousands&quot; of the machines since it started shippingthem in mid-December and has orders for &quot;thousands&quot; more.   But analysts discounted that news, noting that Compaqdidn't have very big expectations to begin with for the colorportable computer, which carries price tags of $10,000 andup.&quot;That is not a company driving product,&quot; said Jim Poyner,an analyst at Rauscher Pierces Refsnes Inc., Dallas.   Still, Compaq used the announcement to take a swipe atcompetitors and quiet critics, who charged that an 18-poundmachine that must be plugged in wouldn't have much of amarket. A spokeswoman said the computer has found a nichewith software designers who want to demonstrate theirproducts, consultants or technicians who need a powerfulportable computer to analyze a computer network'sperformance, as well as people who need a portable computerfor computer-aided design or multimedia presentations.   The company said its machines shouldn't be confused with&quot;vapor color notebooks,&quot; an apparent dig at Dell ComputerCorp. and other competitors that have announced, but haven'tyet shipped, notebook computers with lesser, passivematrixcolor screens. Dell, based in Austin, Texas, said this week,that its new color notebooks would be available in 30 daysand sell for as little as $3,999.   Compaq said it is &quot;currently pursuing color notebooktechnology.&quot; The company is expected to introduce its ownmodels this year.</TEXT></DOC>
