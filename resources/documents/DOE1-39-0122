<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-39-0122 </DOCNO><TEXT>Reaction of UO/sub 2/F/sub 2/ with UF/sub 5/ at 400deg C under UF/sub6/-pressure of 3atm followed by evaporation of excess UF/sub 5/ has yieldeda greenish white residue. Its X-ray diffraction pattern and infraredspectrum are sufficiently unique to establish that this material is atrue compound. Its chemical formula has been shown to be U/sub 2/O/sub2/F/sub 7/, on the grounds of chemical analysis and thermal decomposition.The oxygen content was dermined directly by means of /sup 18/O isotopicdilution method based on the combustion of the samples with BrF/sub 5/.</TEXT></DOC>
