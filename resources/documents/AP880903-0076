The most telling remark about their relationship came fromDukakis himself last year at their worst moment, when the governorand then-longshot presidential candidate described his departingcampaign manager as ``like a brother.''   Last week's announcement of his return as campaign vice chairmanimmediately energized a campaign headquarters full of staffersreading reports their effort was moribund.   ``Now we've got the A-team,'' said Dukakis campaign issuesadviser Thomas Herman, a former Dukakis state aide brought intothat job by Sasso. ``There's no question that John is as close toMichael Dukakis as anyone else is.''   Dukakis and Sasso met on a train platform in 1978 shortly afterDukakis suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Edward J.King in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. Sasso, so impressedthat Dukakis kept a commitment to attend an event he had organized,offered his assistance should Dukakis decide to venture back intopolitics.   Mindful of that promise, Dukakis in 1980 asked Sasso to managehis 1982 comeback effort against King, a bruising campaign thatincluded an incident not unlike the ``attack video'' episode thatdrove Delware Sen. Joseph Biden from the presidential race andSasso from the Dukakis presidential campaign.   Sasso played for reporters what became known as the ``sex tape''_ a parody that made fun of the King's wife's struggle againstpolio. That same campaign included a Dukakis television ad in whicha supporter was shown cheering on Dukakis and referring to King asa ``son of a bitch.''   Dukakis won the nasty primary battle and coasted to victory inthe fall. Back in office, he installed Sasso as his chief secretary_ his top liason with legislators who wanted little to do withDukakis in his first term.   ``He's the hit man,'' said former House Minority Leader RoyallSwitzler. ``John is the guy behind the scenes for Dukakis and hasproven himself to be the master of dirty tricks,'' said Switzler,adding that it was Sasso who would negotiate legislative deals forDukakis by threatening votoes of pet projects to win votes forcontroversial matters backed by the governor.   Dukakis loyalists disputed Switzler's characterizations.   ``He believes in playing the game with vigor but with fairnessas well,'' said John DeVillars, Sasso's former deputy who remainsat his Statehouse post.   Sasso, 41, also assumed a role he came to relish: handling thegovernor's media relations. Dukakis never goes off the record witha reporter; Sasso would do so frequently, steering reporters towhat he considered stories.   It was in that role that he distributed to reporters videotapesshowing Biden borrowing without attribution the rhetoric of aBritish politician, a story that began a flurry of negative reportsthat forced Biden from the race.   That Sasso, described by one Dukakis aide as ``the man with thebest instincts in the business,'' targeted Biden was no surprise.Only Biden was rivaling Dukakis in early fund-raising among theDemocratic presidential candidates and was about to get majorpublicity in his role as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committeeduring hearings on President Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork tothe Supreme Court.   Sasso's role with the Dukakis campaign was not his first ventureinto presidential politics. He had been a field organizer for Sen.Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., in 1980 and also took a leave fromDukakis' staff to manage Geraldine Ferraro's 1984 vice presidentialcampaign.   It was after the Walter Mondale-Ferraro ticket was defeated byPresident Reagan that Sasso began promoting Dukakis as a 1988presidential contender. Dukakis at first discouraged such talk,asking Sasso and other aides to focus on his 1986 gubernatorialre-election.   In the midst of that campaign Sasso began drafting a memoencouraging Dukakis to run, arguing that his record of achievementin Massachusetts and optimistic approach was a winning combinationfour years after charges of ``gloom and doom'' doomed Mondale.   When Dukakis decided to run, he quickly installed Sasso ascampaign manager. Since his resignation last year, Sasso has spokento Dukakis frequently but has had no formal campaign role. He shiedaway from reporters, and was described by friends as sullen,unhappy on the sidelines.   ``I'm delighted to be back as part of the general electionteam,'' a beaming Sasso said Friday, ``because I've always beencommitted to Michael Dukakis.''</TEXT></DOC>
