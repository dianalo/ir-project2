Biological viruses are pieces of the hereditary code that takeover a cell's machinery to trick it into making thousands ofduplicates of the original virus that spread from cell to cell.Viruses cause diseases such as AIDS.   In a similar fashion, a computer virus is a computer program thatcarries in its code instructions for replicating itself perfectly.   Once it invades a computer, the virus temporarily takes controlof the operating system, which is the master program that allows thecomputer to run other programs, such as word-processing software.   The virus spreads into other programs in the computer and spreadsfrom one computer to the next as users give each other floppy disksor link up over telephone lines.   Some viruses are created by pranksters and do no more thandeliver a message to an unsuspecting user. Others can wipe outstored data and slow or damage a computer's hardware.</TEXT></DOC>
