The agreement -- announced simultaneously in the U.S., Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada -- would limit exports of rockets, guidance systems, and parts of such systems if it's believed the recipients would use them to build missiles capable of carrying 1,100-pound warheads 180 miles or more.    U.S. officials said the accord will result in the restriction of exports of so-called &quot;dual use&quot; technologies -- those with military and civilian applications -- to nations where the development of peaceful space-launching capabilities may be accompanied by the concealed development of warhead-carrying vehicles. Space-launch vehicles and ballistic missile systems, the officials noted, rely on similar technologies.    According to officials, the agreement would be enforced &quot;collegially&quot; among Western industrial nations, much the same way as a group of &quot;nuclear-supplier&quot; nations formed in the 1970s put controls on components for nuclear explosives and related production facilities. While the controls on nuclear supplies appear to have slowed the arms race among smaller nations, Pakistan -- and possibly other countries -- has been able to obtain a considerable amount of weapons-related technology through private dealers in Europe, the U.S. and in Canada.    One U.S. official said the new controls will slow the development of missiles. But, he added, &quot;we don't know by how much.&quot;    U.S. officials wouldn't identify the countries at which the controls are aimed. But other knowledgeable sources cited India and Brazil as being nations of major concern, followed by Argentina, Israel, South Korea, Taiwan, South Africa and Pakistan. All have begun to build missile programs based on technology taken from major powers, including the U.S.    Among the problem nations, India and Israel are believed to have nuclear weapons and Pakistan is thought to be very close to production of a nuclear warhead. South Africa, Brazil and Argentina are also believed to have extensive programs to develop nuclear weapons.    The agreement specifies two categories of control for products and technical data related to missiles' production and use. The first category would include rockets, rocket engines, guidance systems, heat shields and electronic parts for reentry vehicles and guidance systems. Under the agreement, export licenses will be denied for equipment used to produce these items, and there would be a &quot;strong presumption&quot; to deny licenses for the items themselves.    The second category includes parts for such items, plus rocket-fuel technology, missile computers, lightweight turbojet engines and certain composite materials used for warheads and heat shields, tracking systems and avionics equipment. Controls would be imposed on exports of those items to countries where the U.S. and other suppliers suspect missile projects are in progress.    The new controls are intended both to hinder the spread of rocket-borne ballistic missiles -- which travel into space and then back down through the atmosphere -- and the development of cruise missiles, which rely on slower, air-breathing engines and fly close to the ground.    President Reagan in 1982 authorized the secret negotiations that led to the pact. The talks resulted in informal controls on some of the technologies for several months, officials said, and the formal controls began on April 7 with an exchange of diplomatic notes among the seven participating nations.    U.S. officials said the group's next goal is to get the Soviet Union and China to sign the agreement. After that, similar negotiations will begin with a group of smaller, but industrially advanced, nations including: Austria, Sweden, Switzerland, Israel and Egypt.    Missile programs under way in some developing nations have evolved from &quot;sounding rockets,&quot; small rockets used to make scientific measurements in the upper atmosphere. In other countries, they have sprung from attempts to improve older versions of military missiles obtained from major nations. According to U.S. and foreign industry sources, the supplier nations are concerned about the following missile projects:    --Brazil launched its program with U.S.-supplied sounding rockets in 1966 and has since developed much larger boosters. According to press reports from Brazil, the country currently is working on the SS-300, a missile capable of firing a 2,200-pound warhead 180 miles. Brazil reportedly also has received guidance technology from China.    --India has been modifying a rocket launcher called the SLV, which bears what one source described as &quot;a striking resemblance&quot; to the U.S. Scout rocket, the smallest U.S. launch vehicle. One version of the Indian launcher uses a second-stage rocket that appears to have been derived from a French rocket engine. India recently announced the opening of the Balasore National Test Range, which is said to be devoted to testing long-range missiles.    --Argentina reportedly has tested the first stage of an intermediate-range missile called the Condor, using help from West German and Italian rocket scientists. It is also said to be working on production of a cruise missile.    --Israel developed its Jericho II missile from a French design that can carry a 1,500-pound payload more than 300 miles. Intelligence sources believe Israel also is developing a cruise missile, sharing technology with South Africa and Taiwan.    --Pakistan recently announced a 10-year, $100 million space program that will build on Pakistani missile designs derived from imported sounding rockets. Pakistan has reportedly been negotiating for help from a West German company, Orbital Transport andamp; Raketen AG, which has had similar dealings with Libya.    --South Korean scientists reportedly have improved a U.S. Nike-Hercules missile as part of an effort to assemble an intermediate-range ballistic missile from parts available on the international market. The U.S. dropped the Nike-Hercules missile, originally designed as an anti-aircraft missile, from its arsenal in the 1970s and transferred it to South Korea.    --Taiwan, reportedly with the help of Israeli scientists, has been working on missile-guidance systems. Its rocket scientists, many of them educated in the U.S., developed a surface-to-surface missile similar to the U.S. Lance missile in the late 1970s.    --South African industry sources have disclosed that there is a program to develop long-range ballistic and cruise missiles. South Africa also is building a long airstrip on remote Marion Island, 1,200 miles south of Cape Town, which some U.S. analysts believe may be used as part of a missile test range.    --Libya is believed to be getting help from a West German company and other European sources in an attempt to enhance the range and load-carrying capabilities of supposedly outdated Scud missiles it obtained from the Soviet Union.   ---   Eduardo Lachica contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
