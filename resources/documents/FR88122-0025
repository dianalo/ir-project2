Frost, (202) 632-0496.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>supplementary information: </T2><T3>Cooperative Education Program: </T3>Cooperative education is a methodof education which includes full-time or part-time periods of study andpaid employment related to a student's academic study or career goals inorder to qualify for permanent employment upon graduation. It is a plannedand progressive educational program designed to attract quality studentsinto the labor force. A working agreement dealing with education and workrequirements must exist between the educational institution, employer,and student at the time of appointment. A key feature of the program isthe noncompetitive conversion of a student from the excepted service intothe competitive service after satisfactory completion of educational andwork requirements as authorized under Executive Order 12015, dated October22, 1977. Currently, Federal Co-op students in baccalaureate, graduate,and associate degree-granting programs are eligible for noncompetitiveconversion under 5 CFR 213.3202 (a), (b), and (c), respectively, if theysatisfactorily complete degree requirements combined with study-relatedwork assignments in a Federal agency.Recently, a Federal Task Force comprised of representatives from Federalagencies, educational institutions, the Department of Education and theOffice of Personnel Management reviewed regulations pertaining to Co-opPrograms in an effort to simplify guidance, grant more flexibility to Federalagencies, and increase the quality of student employment programs Governmentwide.Concurrently, a study was undertaken of clerical and administrative supportoccupations and of the need to identify proactive approaches to alleviaterecruiting shortages in major metropolitan areas in order to meet futurework force demands. Recommendations to establish the proposed regulationsand simplify processes were strongly endorsed by both task groups. Theproposals basically apply the same requirements to high school and undergraduatecertificate program students as exist in the higher education Co-op programs.In 1986, there were 2,080 students in the High School Co-op Program. Currently,high school students, upon graduation, have their appointments terminatedin the Co-op program and they must recompete for Federal service positions.This usually occurs after students have performed successfully and fora substantial period of time on the job in a Federal agency. Through noncompetitiveconversion of high school Co-op students, we can improve the efficiencyand effectiveness of Federal staffing programs and the Government can gaintrained personnel in clerical, administrative support, technician, helperand preapprentice occupations. The same concept applies to students inundergraduate certificate programs, who previously have not been eligiblefor participation in Co-op programs. These revisions also eliminate theuse of andSection; 213.3102(g) and (q), Schedule A appointing authorities,for Co-op students, since Schedule B will be used for Co-op students atall educational levels of study.<T3>Restriction on Hiring of Sons and Daughters: </T3>In line with programsimplification efforts, OPM is recommending removal of andSection; 213.3201(b)and 338.202(d) ``Restriction on sons and daughters,'' for student employmentprograms conducted under Executive Order 12015. These regulations are alreadycovered under andSection; 310.103 (a), (b), and (c), ``Restrictions on theEmployment of Relatives,'' which state that a ``public official shall notadvocate one of his/her ``relatives'' and/or appoint, employ, promote,or advance them to a position in his/her agency or in an agency over whichhe/she exercises jurisdiction or control.'' The definition of relativeas contained in andSection; 310.102, means ``father, mother, son, daughter,brother, sister, uncle, aunt, first cousin, nephew, niece, husband, wife,father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law,sister-in-law, stepfather, stepmother, stepson, stepdaughter, stepbrother,stepsister, half-brother, or half-sister.'' In today's environment students,in addition to being sons and daughters, are also husbands, wives, mothers,fathers, etc., and are adequately covered under Part 310.In addition, students are referred to Federal agencies for work assignmentsby the educational institution based on their academic standing and eligibilityin the school's Co-op program. Sufficient controls, built into the referralprocess, along with existing ``Employment of Relatives'' restrictions,will ensure against the hiring of relatives over which a public officialhas control or jurisdiction. Agencies will have the flexibility to applyany additional controls they feel are necessary.<T3>Proposed Amendments:</T3> The proposed regulations will: (1) reviseandSection; 213.3102(q)(2)(ii), Schedule A authority, deleting referencesto Co-op students; (2) revise Schedule B authority, andSection; 213.3202(e)to include all high school Co-op students for noncompetitive conversion,instead of only the positions in skilled trades and craft occupations;(3) add a new Schedule B authority as andSection; 213.3202(g) for noncompetitiveconversion of Federal Co-op students earning undergraduate certificatesin an accredited college, technical, trade, vocational, or business school;and (4) remove restrictions on sons and daughters in andSection;andSection;213.3201(b) and 338.202(d) with the understanding that restrictions under``Employment of Relatives'' regulations in andSection; 310.103 (a), (b),and (c) will prevail, along with any additional controls an agency mayfeel are necessary. Because of shortages of quality and quantities of candidates availablethrough student employment recruiting sources and the inability to meetagency staffing needs, it was determined that these regulations were neededto meet Federal work force demands. Appointments will be permitted underboth of the new appointing authorities by any Federal agency without priorOPM approval. OPM will monitor use of these special appointing authoritiesthrough the Central Personnel Data File (CPDF) reports. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation </ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of Executive Order (E.O.) 12291, Federal Regulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because the regulation appliesonly to appointment procedures for certain employees in Federal agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG><T3>5 CFR Part 213</T3> Government employees. 5 CFR Part 338 Government employees, Nepotism, Aged.<ITAG tagnum="20">Office of Personnel Management. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director. </ITAG>Accordingly, OPM proposes to amend 5 CFR Parts 213 and 338 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 213_EXCEPTED SERVICE </ITAG>1.
