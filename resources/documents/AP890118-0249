Today, threeyears after it elected a civilian as president, it still is tryingto shake off its past.   Civilian authority, it is widely agreed, is conditioned onmilitary consent and supervision.   ``I assumed the presidency to begin a new attempt to establishconstitutional democracy in our country,'' President Vinicio Cerezotold Congress on Jan. 14, the anniversary of his inauguration.   ``We can say we have achieved some of our goals. We are in bettershape than before.''   ``Guatemala is living through a transition government,'' thedefense minister, Gen. Hector Gramajo, said in an interview. ``Wewill have a new Guatemala by the year 2000.''   Under the generals of the early 1980s, Guatemala was aninternational pariah. In an effort to wipe out a stubborn leftistinsurgency, human rights groups said, the armed forces andmilitary-linked death squads killed tens of thousands of suspectedgovernment opponents _ accusations the armed forces deny.   Would-be organizers of left-leaning labor unions were slain. Thepress was tightly muzzled. Above-ground political activity by anyorganization to the left of center was nil. The economy was stagnant.   The United States, then under President Jimmy Carter, cut offU.S. aid. Non-military aid resumed under the Reagan administration,but a decision to let Guatemala buy almost $14 million worth of M-16rifles last year drew fire from congressional critics in Washington.   Today, the U.S. State Department calls Guatemala an ``emergingdemocracy,'' a classification that remains controversial.   Expression is much freer nowadays, though still subject to someunwritten restraints. A leftist-led labor federation has grownimpressively. Politicians who describe themselves as socialistsspeak out and survive.   Thousands of Indians driven into the hills or across the northernborder into Mexico by harsh military campaigns are beginning toreturn. The insurgency sputters along, but at a much lower level;the 1,500 or so guerrilla fighters hold no territory.   Economic growth in 1988 was a robust 3.5 percent, with officialspredicting even greater expansion this year.   But the progress was made under a watchful military eye thatlimits the authority of Cerezo, the legislature and the judiciary.   A coup attempt May 11, reportedly sponsored by extreme rightistbusinessmen and landowners, was put down without bloodshed whenDefense Minister Gramajo backed the government.   ``The military is disposed to stop being part of the problem,''Gramajo said in the interview. ``It rather will be part of thesolution. Military power is exercised in military matters, and inthe broader sense, we serve the function of stabilizers.''   Still, the attempted rebellion made clear the degree to whichCerezo's continued occupation of the presidential palace depended onmilitary consent.   Diplomats and other observers said he was obliged to agree toseveral rebel demands backed by even those officers opposed to acoup.   Among them were a halt to tentative efforts to separate policeforces from military command.   ``May 11 put an end to any illusion of real power he might havethought he had,'' said the Rev. Andres Giron, a Roman Catholicpriest and peasant organizer. Giron, a longtime friend of Cerezo's,said he probably will ask for a dispensation from the Vatican to runfor president in 1990.   ``Here you can be the government, but you can't govern, becauseyou've got thousands of guns pointed at your back,'' said aprovincial mayor and member of Cerezo's Christian Democratic Party,commenting only on condition of anonymity.   Land reform is one area of concern.   Peasant organizations estimate 70 percent of the country's arableland is owned by 1 percent of the population. Other groups disputethat figure, but acknowledge that land distribution is greatlyskewed in favor of a tiny upper class.   Members of the diplomatic corps said Cerezo would not be allowedto establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union or Cuba,although foreign relations generally are an executive branchprerogative in Western democracies.   ``This government doesn't have the characteristics of what youwould call a democracy,'' said a government official involved ininvestigation of human rights abuses.   Most diplomats agree that Cerezo has proven adept at walking afine line, that he is a pragmatic master of compromise. With theright divided and the left emerging from decades of repression, thecentrist Christian Democrats appear in good shape to retain thepresidency when Cerezo, who cannot succeed himself, leaves officeoffice in 1991.   Cerezo appears intent on ingratiationg himself with the militaryuntil then.   When 22 peasants were massacred last November in Chimaltenangoprovince, he immediately accepted the military version of eventsthat put blame on leftist guerrillas.   He did so despite what his own government's human rightsattorney, Gonzalo Menendez, described as a lack of evidenceimplicating any particular individuals or organizations.   On New Years' Day, 83 people drowned when a crowded ferrycapsized while being towed by a navy patrol vessel.   Survivors, including a tugboat captain, said a recklesslyexecuted tow was the disasters' principal cause, but Cerezo, forwhom defense of the military has become a reflex, praised the navy'srescue efforts.   ``If the navy had not been there, the tragedy would have beenworse,'' he said before leaving Jan. 3 for a 10-day trip to theUnited States.   His office described the trip as a ``personal vacation,'' and hestayed on vacation even as argument swirled over whether CentralAmerican presidents should hold a summit conference Jan. 15-16.   Foreign Minister Alfonso Cabrera, looking for a success tobolster his prospective presidential campaign, pushed the summit,designed to restart the Central American peace process and finallyend guerrilla wars in the region.   Cabrera was unsuccessful and the summit was postponed; Cerezomade no public statement and took no visible part in the debate,which was over before he returned to Guatemala.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Jan. 22</NOTE></DOC>
