The classified report estimates that the production facilitiesowned by the Energy Department need $50 billion worth of renovationsand modernization, according to administration and congressionalsources who spoke on condition they not be identified.   The report has been sent to the White House, and accounts of someprovisions of it appeared over the weekend and on Monday in TheWashington Post and the Los Angeles Times.   The White House had been scheduled to send it to the House andSenate Armed Services committees later this week, but anadministration source said the schedule might slip.   The ``theme park'' plan would organize many weapons activitiesaround the principal nuclear material involved, eventuallyconcentrating all plutonium processing at the Idaho NationalEngineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls, uranium activities at OakRidge, Tenn., and tritium activities at the Savannah River Plantnear Aiken, S.C., congressional sources said.   This would mean closure of the Rocky Flats plant near Denver,which makes plutonium triggers for thermonuclear weapons powered bytritium, and the Feed Materials Production Center near Fernald,Ohio., a uranium foundry, according to the report.   There are other activities that could be moved into the ``themeparks,'' and the sources said they were not sure just which might bemoved.   Doug Elmets, press secretary for the department, declined tocomment on the report.   Rep. David E. Skaggs, D-Colo., whose district includes the RockyFlats plant, said he was unaware of the plan for ``theme parks'' andwould not comment without seeing the report.   The Rocky Flats plant is closed for cleanup inside one of itsbuildings because of accidental contamination of three employees inOctober.   An administration source said the Energy Department had notchanged its estimate that $110 billion would be needed over the next40 years to repair environmental damage at the 17 factories andlaboratories in 12 states involved in manufacturing nuclear weaponsand components.   The report, called the ``2010 report'' for the time horizon it isto look toward, calls for the operation of four new gas-cooledreactors to manufacture tritium at the Idaho facility and a newwater-cooled reactor at the Savannah River plant in a design similarto the three existing tritium reactors there.   The Savannah River tritium reactors are closed to upgrade safetyequipment and procedures. Energy Secretary John Herrington has saidhe expected them to reopen in the spring or summer, but somepublished accounts have said it might be later than that.   Tritium decays fairly rapidly _ 5.5 percent of any startingamount turns into inert helium in a year _ and must be replenishedin the nation's nuclear weapons from time to time. Supply figuresare secret. No such replenishment is needed of uranium and plutoniumcomponents, which frequently are recycled into new weapons when oldones are retired.   The department's $6.8 billion plan to replace its tritiumreactors, released last summer, called for a new Savannah Riverreactor and only one Idaho reactor, though the Idaho reactor was ofa ``modular'' design that could be reproduced easily.   Both new designs could produce either tritium or plutonium,according to the design of the uranium fuel they are loaded with. Toproduce tritium, lithium is added to fuel assemblies.   One congressional source said the department was faced with achoice of where to put the plutonium site, Idaho Falls or theHanford Nuclear Reservation near Richland, Wash., and it chose Idahobecause of growing opposition in the Richland area and the severityof contamination there.   The Idaho reactors would sell either electricity _ or steam tomake electricity _ to a local utility, according to the department'ssummer plan. A now-mothballed Hanford reactor sold steam to theWashington Public Power Supply System for 25 years to makeelectricity.</TEXT></DOC>
