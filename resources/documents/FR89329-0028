Bourgoin, Federal MaritimeCommission, 1100 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20573, (202) 523-5740.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> Pursuant to the authority of section19(1)(b), Merchant Marine Act, 1920 (``Section 19''), 46 U.S.C. app. 876(1)(b),as implemented by 46 CFR Part 585, the Federal Maritime Commission (``Commission''or ``FMC'') is authorized and directed to make rules and regulations affectingshipping in the foreign trade of the United States in order to adjust ormeet general or special conditions unfavorable to shipping in the foreigntrade of the United States and which arise out of, or result from, foreignlaws, rules or regulations, or from competitive methods or practices employedby owners, operators, agents or masters of vessels of a foreign country.The types of conditions which the Commission has found to be unfavorableto shipping in the foreign trade of the United States are set forth at46 CFR 585.3. Among these are conditions which: (1) Preclude vessels inthe foreign trade of the United States from competing in the trade on thesame basis as any other vessel; (2) reserve substantial cargoes to thenational-flag or other vessels and fail to provide, on reasonable terms,for effective and equal access to such cargo by vessels in the foreigntrade of the United States; and (3) are discriminatory or unfair as betweencarriers, shippers, exporters, importers, or ports or between exportersfrom the United States and their foreign competitors, 46 CFR 585.3 (a),(b) and (d). <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>In March 1986, the Commission received communications from shippers andshipper organizations expressing concern over the impact of Supreme DecreeNo. 009-86-TCl \1\<NOTE/> (Decree 009-86), which became effective on February 28, 1986,and which reserved 100 percent of all imported and exported ocean freightgenerated by Peru's foreign trade for Peruvian-flag carriers. The FMC beganits inquiry into this matter by publishing a Notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 22, 1986 (51 FR 15069) (``April 1986Notice''), wherein the Commission requested interested persons to submitviews, arguments or data relating to the impact of the Government of Peru's(``GOP'') enactment, implementation and enforcement of Decree 009-86 onthe United States/Peru oceanborne trade (``Trade''), to determine whetheraction pursuant to section 19 was warranted.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Decree 009-86 amended Supreme Decree No. 036-82-TC (``Decree036-82''), effective September 1982. Decree 036-82 reserves Peruvian importand export cargoes for Peruvian-flag vessels and sets out waiver and cargomanifest certification requirements for non-Peruvian-flag carriers. Theexact percentage of cargo reserved for Peruvian-flag carriers is not specifiedin Decree 036-82. Another decree states that 50 percent of Peruvian importand export cargo is reserved for Peruvian-flag carriers. The amount of cargo reserved by Decree 009-86 for Peruvian-flag carrierscould be reduced as follows: (1) On the basis of strict reciprocity; \2\<NOTE/> (2) pursuant to government or commercial agreement \3\<NOTE/> among non-Peruvian and Peruvian/flag carriers, preferablyincluding Compania Peruana de Vapores (``CPV''), the Peruvian state shippingline; or (3) when the Peruvian Director General of Maritime Transportationor Peruvian Consuls grant non-Peruvian-flag or non-associate carriers authorizationto carry Peruvian export or import cargoes. Authorization for the use ofnon-Peruvian-flag or non-associate carriers may be granted in the formof a waiver or cargo manifest certification when Peruvian-flag or associatecarriers are not available and in position within 12 days \4\<NOTE/> following the proposed date of shipment of non-perishableproducts, or within 4 days in the case of perishable products, or whenno Peruvian-flag carrier serves the relevant port. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>E.q.</T3>, U.S. carriers' access to Peruvian cargoes would be proportionalto Peruvian carriers' access to U.S. cargoes. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Non-Peruvian-flag carriers which become parties to suchcommercial agreements may be granted associate status upon approval bythe GOP. Associate carriers are generally excepted from cargo manifestcertification and waiver requirements under Decree Nos. 009-86 and 036-82.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Supreme Decree No. 033-86-TC of June 11, 1986, modifiedDecree 009-86 by reducing the number of days a shipment must wait for aPeruvian-flag or associate carrier from 15 days to 12 days. Prior to the closing date for comments to the April 1986 Notice, the Commissionreceived through the Department of State, a diplomatic note from the GOPrequesting a six-month extension of the period allowed for submitting comments,along with guarantees from the GOP that there would be no interruptionof services or disruption in the Trade and the procedures for better serviceswould be expedited. Before acting on the GOP's request for a six-monthextension the Commission sought clarification from the GOP regarding thestatus of U.S. and third-flag operations in the Trade, and the effect onthose carriers of the guarantees referred to by the GOP. In August 1986,the Department of State transmitted a communique from the GOP in whichit provided certain assurances regarding implementation of Decree 009-86and clarified points made in its diplomatic note. In its communique, the GOP assured that its regulations would allow third-flagcarriers to operate in the Trade in accordance with established rules,and that over the six-month period it would not levy any fines on third-flagcarriers operating in the Trade for noncompliance with Decree 009-86. Further,the GOP informed the Commission that the Government of Chile had on August7, 1986, implemented Resolution No. 2 which excluded Peruvian-flag carriersfrom operating in certain Chile/third-country trades including the Chile/UnitedStates trade.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ On September 26, 1986, it was reported by the Departmentof State that the Government of Chile had implemented Resolution No. 2because of the GOP's decision to apply Decree 009-86 to Chilean carriers.The Department further explained that on September 15, 1986, the GOP issuedMinisterial Resolution No. 044-86-TC/AC (``Resolution 044-86''), whichexcluded Chilean-flag vessels from transporting cargo in certain Peru/third-countrytrades because of the Government of Chile's refusal to lift ResolutionNo. 2. On August 27, 1986, the Commission issued a Notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 30543) (``August 1986 Notice''), statingthe following:<ITAG tagnum="21">By removing the threat of penalties for noncompliance with the waiverand cargo manifest certification requirements, the communique from theGovernment of Peru is taken by the Commission to mean, in effect, thatshippers will be allowed to select the carrier of their choice and allcarriers, including U.S. and third-flag, will have free and open accessto the U.S./Peru trade. Based on this understanding, the Commission ishereby serving notice that it will defer any action pursuant to section19(1)(b) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, with respect to the implementationof the February Decree, for a period of six months from the date of publicationof this Notice in the Federal Register provided the assurances given inthe Peruvian communique transmitted to the Commission on August 19, 1986,are observed.</ITAG>Further, the Commission's August 1986 Notice advised that it did not seea need for extending the comment period, as requested by the GOP, but notedthat it would expect interested parties to advise the Commission promptlyif they believe that conditions in the Trade warrant further Commissionaction. Subsequent to the issuance of the August 1986 Notice, as well as afterthe six-month period had expired in February 1987, the Commission receivedcommunications from the Department of State, GOP, shippers, shipper organizations,freight forwarders and carriers. A number of the comments indicated thatthe GOP waiver system under Decree 009-86 did not allow shippers to selecttheir preferred carriers and that the six-month deferral period failedto reopen the Trade to all non-Peruvian-flag carriers. On the basis of all the information received the Commission published aNotice of Proposed Rulemaking in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 13, 1987 (``Proposed Rule'') (52 FR11832), to address apparent conditions unfavorable to shipping in the Tradepursuant to Section 19. The Proposed Rule, which initiated this docketedproceeding, recognized the appearance of unfavorable conditions in theTrade, and proposed the suspension of tariffs of Peruvian-flag carriersunless such carriers within 25 days of the issuance of a final rule obtainedauthorized status by filing with the Commission a certificate from theGOP stating unequivocally that no law, regulation or practice precludesany non-Peruvian-flag vessel from competing in the Trade on the same basisas any other vessel. Comments on the Proposed Rule were requested. Subsequent to issuance of the Proposed Rule, regulations (``Regulations'')\6\<NOTE/> were issued by the GOP pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding(``MOU'') signed by the United States Government (``USG'') and the GOPon May 1, 1987. These Regulations set forth new requirements and proceduresthat shipping lines operating third-flag vessels must observe in orderto obtain authorizations from the GOP Ministry of Transportation and Communicationsto participate in the Trade. The GOP advised through the Department ofState, that the ``authorization'' system under the Regulations totallyreplaced the existing ``waiver'' system for granting third-flag carriersaccess to the Trade.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ These Regulations were contained in Ministerial ResolutionNo. 027-87-TC/AC (``Resolution''). Based on all the information received the Commission issued a Final Ruleon December 7, 1987 (``December 1987 Final Rule'') (52 FR 46356). In issuingits Final Rule the Commission explained that while it recognized the goodfaith efforts made by the USG and GOP to address the situation in the Tradethrough diplomatic means, the resultant Regulations which implement theMOU did not satisfactorily resolve that situation. The Commission statedthat, in fact, the Regulations, in effect, would continue in place thevery types of restrictions and impediments which prompted this proceedingin the first instance. Although third-flag carriers were no longer requiredto obtain ``waivers'' for individual shipments, they were to obtain ``authorizations''to participate in the Trade. The Commission found this authorization processas inconsistent with free access to the Trade as was the waiver systemit replaced. In this regard, the Commission also added that it was unknownwhether Chilean-flag carriers would be granted authorizations and allowedto operate in the Trade, particularly in light of the existence of PeruvianResolution 044-86 which excluded Chilean-flag carriers from certain Peru/third-countrytrades. Finally, the Commission advised that it could not accept as a satisfactoryresolution of this matter an accommodation which would permit the GOP todeny authorization to a third-flag operator in the Trade if the countryof nationality of that operator bars participation to Peruvian flag carriersin any of its third-country trades. The Commission explained that to acceptthe proposition that the GOP can settle disputes with foreign nations byimposing burdens on U.S. commerce, in effect would allow the GOP to holdthe U.S.-Peru trade hostage to obtaining concessions elsewhere. Thus, the December 1987 Final Rule suspended the tariffs of the Peruvian-flagcarriers operating in the Trade, with the exception of Naviera AmazonicaPeruana, S.A. (``NAPSA''),\7\<NOTE/> unless such carriers obtain authorized status from the Commission.\8\<NOTE/> The suspension of these tariffs was to become effective March7, 1988.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Under the Final Rule, NAPSA's tariff, FMC No. 3, coveringthe U.S./Iquitos, Peru trade, would not be suspended because the Commissionfound this subtrade distinguishable from the Trade generally, and, therefore,entitled to different treatment. The Final Rule noted that the Commissiondid not receive any complaints regarding this subtrade Further, it statedthat there is no alternative to NAPSA s service in this subtrade. (<T3>See </T3>Docket No. 87-6, 52 FR 46362, December 7, 1987). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The Final Rule states that authorized status shall beconferred upon a Peruvian-flag carrier upon that carrier's submitting tothe Commission a certificate from the GOP stating unequivocally that nolaw, regulation or policy of the GOP will: <ITAG tagnum="28">(i) Preclude any non-Peruvian-flag carrier from competing in the Tradeon the same basis as any other carrier; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(ii) Result in less than meaningful and competitive access by anynon-Peruvian-flag carrier, to cargo designated as reserved under SupremeDecree No. 009-86-TC; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(iii) Impose any administrative burden, including but not limitedto, the necessity to secure an authorization based on the national statusof the carrier, or otherwise discriminate against any non-Peruvian-flagcarrier in the Trade.</ITAG>On February 4, 1988, the ``Peruvian carriers'', <T3>i.e., </T3> CPV, Naviera Neptuno, S.A. (``Neptuno'') and Empresa NavieraSanta (``Santa''), filed a Petition for Reconsideration (``Petition'')requesting that the FMC reconsider its December 1987 Final Rule or stayits effective date on grounds that it was basically directed at Decree009-86 of February 28, 1986, which had been rescinded by GOP Supreme DecreeNo. 004-88-TC (``Decree 004-88'') of January 22, 1988.\9\<NOTE/> They submitted that the Regulations which implemented theMOU also had been rescinded.\1\\0\<NOTE/> Further, the Peruvian carriers advised that while Decree009-86 reserved 100 percent of all Peruvian import and export cargoes,Decree 004-88 reestablishes legislation in existence between 1970 and 1986which reserves 50 percent of Peruvian cargoes to Peruvian-flag or associatecarriers.\1\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Decree 004-88 was published in the Peruvian Official Gazette,``El Peruano,'' on January 25, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ In addition, Resolution No. 044-86 which excluded Chilean-flagcarriers from certain Peru/third-country trades had been rescinded.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ The pre-1986 legal regime is based primarily on Decree036-82.Subsequently, the Commission issued its Notice of Reconsideration of FinalRule on March 8, 1988 (53 FR 7361) (``March 1988 Notice''). In that Noticethe Commission discussed the GOP initiatives, noting that some action wasnecessary to recognize the changed status of the issues brought about bythe GOP's action and, as a technical legal matter, because the rescissionof Decree 009-86 and Resolution 044-86 appeared to have undermined thebasis cited in the December 1987 Final Rule for the Commission's findingsof conditions unfavorable to shipping in the Trade. The Commission withdrewthe December 1987 Final Rule for reconsideration and again invited interestedparties to comment. However, the Commission also pointed out that rescissionalone may not resolve the unfavorable conditions which the December 1987Final Rule addressed, and the Commission stated that, if the system remainsdiscriminatory in the absence of Decree 009-86, it would be prepared toact to reinstate the December 1987 Final Rule on the basis of new findingsthat conditions unfavorable to shipping continue to exist. Subsequent to the issuance of the Commission's March 1988 Notice, threeagreements were filed with the Commission between Peruvian- and Chilean-flagcarriers.\1\\2\<NOTE/> Pursuant to these agreements, the Chilean-flag carriers weregranted associate status by the GOP and thereby given access to the Trade.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\  These agreements are: Agreement No. 212-011180 betweenNeptuno and CSAV, filed March 16, 1988, effective April 30, 1988; AgreementNo. 212-011186, as amended by Agreement No. 212-011186.001, between Santaand Empresa Maritima de Estado, filed March 29, 1988, effective May 13,1988; and Agreement No. 212-011189 between CPV and Compania Chilena deNavegacion Interoceanica, S.A., filed April 12, 1988, effective May 27,1988. Based on comments received in response to its March 1988 Notice, the Commissionannounced on June 7, 1988 (53 FR 20847), that this proceeding would beheld in abeyance and invited further comments and information from interestedparties by August 31, 1988. The Commission, noting that all but one partyhad suggested that the Commission either terminate the proceeding or holdit in abeyance, elected then to give the parties time to assess the impactof certain actions taken by the GOP and the then recently-filed agreementsentered into by Chilean- and Peruvian-flag carriers.On October 6, 1988, the Commission issued a Notice of Further Proceedings(53 FR 39317) and invited interested parties to file replies to commentsreceived on August 31, 1988, from Nedlloyd Lines (``Nedlloyd'') allegingthe continued existence of conditions unfavorable to shipping in the Tradeaffecting shippers as well as carriers. In particular, the Commission invitedcomments in reply to Nedlloyd's contentions that the Trade continues tobe burdened by requirements that are discriminatory, result in uneconomiccommercial circumvention, or adversely affect shippers' choice of carriers,as well as comments on the alternative remedial rule proposed by Nedlloyd.\1\\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ Nedlloyd's alternative proposed rule included sanctionswhich would require Peruvian-flag carriers to obtain waivers from the FMCfor the carriage of cargo in the Trade, and to file periodic reports withthe Commission.Comments have now been received from the Executive Agencies; \1\\4\<NOTE/> Nedlloyd; Shippers for Competitive Ocean Transportation (``SCOT'');CPV, Neptuno, and Santa_jointly (``Peruvian carriers''); Compania Sud Americanade Vapores (``CSAV''); Lykes Bros. Steamship Co. (``Lykes''); AmericanChamber of Commerce of Peru (``Chamber''); and Georgetown Steel Corporation(``GSC''). These comments are summarized below.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\  The U.S. Department of Transportation submitted commentson behalf of the Executive Agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments </ITAG>A. Executive AgenciesThe Executive Agencies state that although GOP maritime policies differsharply from those of the United States, significant progress has beenmade in removing barriers to participation in the Trade by third-flag non-associatecarriers. They, therefore, recommend that the Commission not impose sanctionson Peruvian-flag carriers.The recommendation made by the Executive Agencies is based on responsesfrom the GOP to questions posed by the Executive Agencies regarding accessof foreign-flag non-associate carriers to the Trade. The Executive Agenciesreport that the following information was obtained from the GOP: (1) The GOP waiver requirement for use of a foreign-flag non-associatecarrier only applies to the 50 percent of the cargo that is reserved; (2) Non-associate third-flag vessels may transport cargoes of exporters/importerswhich have already shipped 50 percent of their cargoes on Peruvian or associate-flagcarriers, with the stipulation that these cases be accredited by the TransportationMinistry's Office of Water Transport (``Ministry''); (3) According to Ministerial Resolution No. 054-82-TC/AC (``Resolution054-82''), a shipper must report quarterly to the Ministry on its maritimetransport of cargoes; (4) Once an exporter/importer has shipped 50 percent of its projected quarterlycargo on Peruvian or associate-flag vessels, it may submit sworn informationto this effect to the Ministry and is then accredited by the Ministry touse any carrier it wishes with no further authorization; (5) The Ministry issues an accreditation by telex saying that the exporter/importeris free to ship on any carrier it desires for the remainder of that calendarquarter with no further authorization from the Ministry; (6) Information regarding the waiver process has been disseminated to users;and (7) No rate quotations from potential providers of maritime services arenecessary for obtaining waivers. B. Nedlloyd Nedlloyd contends that unfavorable conditions to shipping continue to existin the Trade. It reports that its extensive efforts to resolve the questionof its access to the Trade have been inconclusive. Nedlloyd believes thatonly the threat of sanctions by the FMC will have any impact on reducingimpediments to access in the Trade. Nedlloyd alleges that with the exception of foreign-flag carriers withassociate status, non-Peruvian-flag carriers cannot carry any Peruviancargo absent some action by the GOP. The GOP actions mentioned by Nedlloydinclude GOP authorizations, waivers, certifications or accreditations.Nedlloyd asserts that given these requirements, it is ``rank sophistry''to argue that there is no reason for concern because only 50 percent ofthe cargo in the Trade is reserved. Further, there is allegedly no directmechanism for a <T3>carrier </T3>to gain access to the ``free'' 50 percent of the cargoes;<T3>shippers </T3>can gain access only by obtaining a GOP accreditation.Nedlloyd contends that the only factual inquiry concerns the mechanicsof how a shipper is granted permission by the GOP to employ non-Peruvian-flagcarriers. Nedlloyd maintains that no matter how ``onerous or perfunctory''the mechanics may be, it has not found a shipper that is willing to confrontthese mechanics. The GOP is said to control access to 100 percent of theTrade and that as a result, Nedlloyd is totally excluded from the Trade.Further, Nedlloyd believes that the current GOP reservation system is moreonerous than the regulations drafted pursuant to the U.S./GOP Memorandumof Understanding that the Commission previously rejected.Nedlloyd describes its operational experience in the Trade since August31, 1988. It reports that it has not obtained any cargo in the Trade. Thissituation is contrasted with that of a previous new entrant, Santa, a Peruvian-flagcarrier, which shortly after entering the Trade allegedly acquired a 25percent market share. Nedlloyd explains that its lack of cargo is due tothe laws which favor use of Peruvian-flag carriers. While allegedly difficult to document, Nedlloyd finds credible reportsof potential customers indicating that the GOP waiver and authorizationrequirements make it impossible for them to do business with Nedlloyd inthe Trade. Further, Nedlloyd states that there are indications that thePeruvian cargo reservation laws are having an adverse impact on its abilityto carry cargo in the United States/Chile trade.\15\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ This assertion is elaborated on in the affidavit attachedto Nedlloyd's comments. Nedlloyd reports that in October 1988, during its third mission to Peru,representatives met with affected Peruvian carriers to discuss barriersto entry.\16\<NOTE/> Nedlloyd recounts that during that meeting it expressed willingnessto enter into an agreement with the Peruvian carriers in order to obtainassociate status as long as such agreement does not require it to set ratescollectively and share revenues. It reports that the reaction of the Peruviancarriers was that Nedlloyd and other third-flag carriers would presenta considerable competitive threat to them and that third-flag carrier accesseither should not be granted under any circumstances, or that Nedlloydshould be permitted access only if it compensated or contributed to thePeruvian carriers for the economic harm that its participation might cause.The Commission is further advised that after Nedlloyd discussed the adverseimpact of the GOP waiver system, the Peruvian carriers stated that thewaiver system was the method by which third-flag carrier access can belimited and that the waiver system should not be reviewed by the GOP unlessNedlloyd withdraws from the FMC proceeding. Nedlloyd expressed concernthat should it withdraw from the proceeding, parties may no longer haveincentive to negotiate. Nedlloyd concludes that the meeting did not resolveits access problem and notes that it has not received any further communicationfrom the GOP or Peruvian carriers. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ Nedlloyd attaches to its comments a summary of theviews expressed at this meeting. The attached affidavit also recounts thecontent of the meeting.andpara; Based on its allegations regarding conditions in the Trade, Nedlloyd commentson the appropriateness of the Final Rule with modifications. Nedlloyd assertsthat given the extensive comment period that the Commission has provided,it sees no procedural bar to immediate implementation of the Final Ruleor related modifications based on subsequent events. It would not, however,disfavor reasonable modifications of sanctions to achieve more precisesymmetry of conditions in the Trade than might be achieved under its August31, 1988 proposed modifications. Further, Nedlloyd states that it wouldnot object to SCOT's proposal that sanctions once promulgated, be delayedin order to permit the GOP or Peruvian carriers to remcve restrictionsin the Trade. Nedlloyd also addresses the November 9, 1988 comments filed by the ExecutiveAgencies. It believes that the optimistic view of the Executive Agenciesthat sanctions are unnecessary due to the fact that significant progresshas been made in liberalizing the Trade, destroys any hope for GOP actionsto remove restrictions or for Nedlloyd to reach a commercial settlement.Nedlloyd asserts that the answers provided by the GOP to the ExecutiveAgencies do not reasonably lead to the conclusion drawn by the ExecutiveAgencies. Allegedly, the ``off-book'' nature of the GOP requirements createsthe ``chilling effect'' previously found to exist by the Commission. Nedlloydmaintains that in contrast with the Executive Agencies' conclusion andrecommendation, shippers are intimidated by the waiver system and 100 percentof all U.S. maritime cargo in the Trade requires some GOP action beforethere can be free carrier selection. C. SCOT SCOT takes the position that conditions in the Trade will remain unfavorab1eas long as the GOP requires a waiver/visa for every U.S. shipment on anon-associate third-flag vessel. The rescission of Decree 009-86 allegedlydid not resolve the basic issues. SCOT states that there is evidence thatthe waiver/visa system is being imposed on shipments from all United Statescoasts to Peru. It asserts that implementation of this system has morethan a ``chilling'' effect on the use of non-associate third-flag vessels.SCOT maintains that in the complex scheduling environment within whichshippers must operate, it is very difficult for a shipper to gamble ona carrier which may be denied the right to lift cargo at any moment. Theultimate effect of imposition of the waiver/visa system is said to denythird-flag carrier access to all cargo in the Trade except for an occasionalspot movement. Further, SCOT maintains that it is not practical for a shipperand a non-associate carrier to enter into a service contract since thecarrier may be denied the right to carry cargo in the Trade by the GOP.It, therefore, concludes that conditions are unfavorable to U.S. shipperinterests represented by SCOT. SCOT explains that in its August 31, 1988 comments to the Commission, itintended to convey that, to its knowledge, the commerce of the United Statesis not immediately suffering, and if good faith negotiations between theUnited States and GOP show promise of a real resolution of the problems,a short delay in Commission action could be tolerated by U.S. shippers.SCOT notes, however, that third-flag carriers may not be able to toleratesuch a delay.SCOT believes that Nedlloyd has presented convincing evidence that it isbeing denied access to the Trade unless it enters into an agreement withPeruvian-flag carriers which would enable it to obtain associate statusunder terms dictated by the GOP. Commenting on Nedlloyd's proposed, modifiedfinal rule, SCOT states that it does not support the approach suggestedby Nedlloyd because of the absence of details on how the rule would beimplemented, the Commission's ability to implement it, and the apparentincrease in the role of government to enforce such a rule. SCOT states that it sees no evidence that conditions unfavorable to shippingin the Trade have been removed and supports action necessary to removesuch conditions. SCOT submits that it does not object to imposition ofan FMC final rule if such action appears essential. It suggests that anotherapproach between immediate implementation of a final rule and an indefinitedelay would be for the Commission to issue a final rule which describessanctions which will be imposed at a specified time unless the unfavorableconditions to shipping are removed. D. Peruvian Carriers The Peruvian carriers take the position that there is no evidence of unfavorableconditions in the Trade. They contend that the GOP's cargo reservationsystem is ``a justified and reasonable accommodation of the interests ofshippers and carriers in the Trade and the national interest of Peru inmaintaining its merchant fleet.'' In justifying the GOP's reservation policies, the Peruvian carriers arguethat small trades such as Peru's require control and rationalization ofservice to ensure the survival of small carriers and maintain stable, competitiveservice. They maintain that the GOP exercises a reasonable amount of controlin the Trade. They contend, however, that even with such control, thereis excess capacity in the Trade and the level of trade is declining. Further, the Peruvian carriers contend that the GOP's 50 percent cargoreservation is less restrictive than the United Nations Code of Conductfor Liner Conferences' (``Code'') 40-40-20 cargo sharing formula. Theymaintain that, while the U.S. has not accepted the Code, GOP laws are inaccordance with generally accepted international practice. The Commission'sSection 19 rules at 46 CFR 585.3(d), are said to recognize that discriminatorytreatment of carriers is justified under generally accepted internationalagreements or practices. Comparisons are also drawn between GOP and U.S.cargo reservation laws. The Peruvian carriers insist that the purpose of the Merchant Marine Act,1920 ``is to promote U.S. shipping interests, primarily the U.S. merchantfleet'' and submit that Section 19 authorizes the Commission to take remedialaction only when foreign laws or practices adversely affect U.S. shippinginterests. The Peruvian carriers provide a summary of the GOP's cargo reservationlaws. They argue that Decree 036-82 does not ``effectively'' reserve 100percent of import and export cargoes for Peruvian-flag vessels, as Nedlloydcontends, but rather reserves only 50 percent of the cargo leaving theremaining 50 percent free to be carried on any vessel. The Peruvian carriersstate that Decree 036-82 in conjunction with Resolution 054-82 establisha system by which non-Peruvian or non-associate third-flag vessels couldbe used to carry reserved cargo. They explain that Resolution 05482 makesit clear that waivers or visas are required for shipments of reserved cargoeson non-associate-flag vessels and are not required for shipments of unreservedcargoes. The Peruvian carriers describe the system by which a shipper,once having shipped 50 percent of its cargo during a quarter of a yearon Peruvian or associate-flag vessels, may use non-associate-flag vessels.\17\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ The system described by the Peruvian carriers tracksthe description set forth in the Executive Agencies' comments.  The Peruvian carriers state that Nedlloyd's assertions are based on a misunderstandingof the GOP laws and are unsupported by the facts. The fact that Nedlloyddid not obtain Peruvian cargo on its first two voyages allegedly does notlead to the conclusion that the GOP laws are the reason. The Peruvian carriersargue that Nedlloyd's failure to obtain cargo was a result of start-upproblems, ``ineffective marketing or the chilling effect of its own marketing.''\18\<NOTE/> They believe that if Nedlloyd's marketing efforts includedinforming shippers of the procedure for employing it for the transportationof unreserved cargo, Nedlloyd could be more successful in obtaining cargoin the Trade.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ The Peruvian carriers advise that Nedlloyd's advertisementsstate that its service in the Trade is subject to GOP cargo reservationlaws. Nedlloyd's failure to explain these restrictions in its advertisementsallegedly could deter shippers from using Nedlloyd's services. The Peruvian carriers contend that conditions in the Trade are favorableand that Nedlloyd does not present any evidence to the contrary. Shippersin the Trade are said to have a wide range of service options at competitiverates and, therefore, there is allegedly no basis for the Commission tofind that shippers' choices are unreasonably restricted merely becausethose choices do not include Nedlloyd or other third-flag carriers in everyinstance.\19\<NOTE/> The Peruvian carriers submit that the complaints that originallyformed the basis for these proceedings have been satisfied and, as a result,conclude that issuance of a rule imposing restrictions against Peruvian-flagcarriers would be arbitrary and capricious and might result in severe disruptionin the Trade.  <ITAG tagnum="28">\19\ The Peruvian carriers state that it is their understanding thatGreat Lakes Transcaribbean Lines (``GLTL''), a third-flag carrier in theTrade, has been granted associated status by the GOP. GLTL, generally acommenter in these proceedings, did not submit comments to the Commission'sNotice of Further Proceedings.</ITAG>The Peruvian carriers believe that Nedlloyd's alternate rule is not a mirrorimage of the GOP's cargo reservation laws and would create unfavorableconditions where none previously existed. They submit that the GOP cargoreservation laws limit access of third-flag carriers and not U.S.-flagcarriers to the Trade. Further, they note that Nedlloyd's rule would shutPeruvian-flag carriers out of the total Trade unless a waiver is granted.This, it is argued, contrasts with the GOP action which restricts only50 percent of the Trade. E. CSAVCSAV, a Chilean-flag carrier, asserts that Nedlloyd's suggested rule wouldbe harmful to the shipping public and to third-flag carriers now servingthe Trade. It explains that the suggested rule would harm third-flag carriersthat are only able to serve the Trade through commercial agreements thatthey have entered into with Peruvian-flag carriers. In particular, CSAVpoints to that portion of the suggested rule which would prohibit cargocarriage by or impose penalties on other third-flag carriers for operatingunder their agreements with Peruvian-flag carriers. CSAV contends thatthe effective result of this provision would be to require CSAV either``(1) to cease serving the Trade because it could not lawfully load cargounder its agreement with Neptuno; (2) to violate its agreement to Neptunoby declining to carry cargo for Neptuno; or (3) to violate the CommissionRule if it complies with its agreement with Neptuno.'' CSAV, therefore,concludes that Nedlloyd is requesting the FMC to impose the burden andcost of its entry into the Trade on innocent third-flag carriers. CSAV asserts that it would be particularly unjust for it to be preventedfrom operating under commercial agreements filed at the behest of the ExecutiveAgencies. It, therefore, requests that the Commission not issue any rulethat would force CSAV to suspend its operation under the Neptuno-CSAV Agreement.F. LykesLykes advises that conditions in the Trade have not adversely affectedits services. It contends that service available in the Trade clearly providessubstantial, if not excessive, shipping opportunities. Lykes states thatbased on its experience, it is not aware of any conditions unfavorableto shipping in the Trade. With regard to Nedlloyd's suggested alternative rule, Lykes states thatit does not believe that the rule would adversely affect its operationsin the Trade. However, Lykes fears that any sanctions imposed by the Commissionwould result in retaliatory actions by the GOP which would be detrimentalto both U.S.-flag carriers and the Trade in general. It maintains thatCommission action which detrimentally affects U.S.-flag carriers wouldappear inconsistent with the intent and purpose of Section 19 and the MerchantMarine Act, 1920.Lykes believes that the instant proceeding should be dismissed given thefact that the situation in the Trade has changed and those parties previouslycomplaining are no longer doing so. It suggests that, if Nedlloyd desires,a new proceeding based on the issues raised by Nedlloyd could be instituted.G. Chamber The Chamber states that despite Nedlloyd's comments, its members continueto indicate that available services are satisfactory and that the GOP continuesto apply its waiver system in as flexible a manner as possible in the Trade.It notes that Nedlloyd's August 31, 1988 comments do not state whetherNedlloyd had been able to obtain a waiver from the GOP for any particularshipment. The Chamber states that, based on its understanding, the GOPhad not received waiver applications from shippers or users on behalf ofNedlloyd. The Chamber concludes that it sees no justification for Commission actionbased on a situation that is satisfactory to its members and the progressalready made as a result of the FMC proceeding. It, therefore, recommendsthat the proceeding be terminated. H. GSC GSC transmitted a letter to the Commission Chairman along with a copy ofa letter to the Honorable Robin Tallon of the U.S. House of Representatives.GSC states that the GOP has told it that it can use foreign-flag vesselsin 1989 with no problems. GSC further reports that the GOP has grantedwaivers to it whenever necessary. As an example, GSC notes that it usedan Ecuadorian-flag vessel in 1988 to ship cargo from Peru to the U.S. GSC concludes that it sees no justification for imposing restrictions againstPeruvian-flag carriers and that any differences of opinions should be workedout between the parties concerned. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>Nedlloyd's contentions that the Trade continues to be burdened by requirementsthat are discriminatory, result in uneconomic commercial circumvention,and adversely affect shippers' choice of carriers, as well as its suggestedalternative remedial rule, brought comments in reply from many of the partieswho have previously participated in this proceeding. While most of thesecomments were simply consistent with the views earlier expressed in thisproceeding by those same parties, a few shed additional light on the presentconditions. The Peruvian carriers once again argue that no evidence of conditions unfavorableto shipping has been presented, and that the GOP cargo reservation systemis necessary and rational for the protection of GOP interests in the Trade.Lykes too argues that its service has not been adversely affected, andthat no conditions unfavorable to shipping have been shown to exist inthe Trade. Other parties similarly urging the Commission to conclude theproceeding without further action, stating that their interests in theTrade are being adequately served, include the Chamber and GSC. The onlyChilean-flag carrier to file comments in this round, CSAV, does not describeconditions in the Trade or their effects on its present service, but directsits concern to the sanctions proposed by Nedlloyd, urging the Commissionnot to take action against Peruvian-flag carriers which would affect itsown status and service. The Executive Agencies, based on information provided by the GOP regardingcarrier access to the Trade, indicate that the present system appears toinclude significant progress in removing barriers to third-flag participation.While the rescission of Decree 009-86 and the re-entry of the Chilean-flagcarriers as associate carriers in the Trade give the appearance at leastof such progress, the continued reservation of a substantial proportionof both U.S. and Peruvian-origin cargo, and the implementation of the cargoreservation system belie that progress. The means by which carriers and shippers may determine when and if theymay deal together, as described by the GOP to the Executive Agencies, leaveus greatly troubled. Thus, for at least some substantial part of each calendarquarter, a third-flag, non-associate carrier wishing to participate inthe Trade must rely upon cargo from shippers willing and able to obtainwaivers from the GOP for specific shipments, until shippers desiring touse its service have shipped half their cargo for the quarter on Peruvian-flagor associate carriers <T3>and</T3> have submitted documentation and obtained GOP accreditationof that fact. Only then can such a carrier and willing shipper freely dobusiness together. These flag-based procedures do not appear to us to differgreatly in kind or burdensomeness from the original waiver system, or theshort-lived authorization system, which formed the basis for the concernswe have expressed repeatedly in this proceeding. The latest comments of affected shippers and carriers indicate not onlythat the direct effects of the GOP decrees are still being felt, but thatthe more subtle, indirect effects_the ``chilling effect'' described byNedlloyd and SCOT_are taking their toll. Thus, as SCOT points out, therequirement that a shipper fulfill its obligation to ship half its cargofor each calendar quarter on Peruvian-flag or associate carriers priorto being able to obtain from the GOP documentary confirmation that it isfree to use any carrier for its remaining cargo for the calendar quarter,effectively precludes shippers from seeking service contracts with non-associatecarriers. The fact that service contracts are viable only with Peruvian-flagand associate carriers reinforces the reluctance of shippers to undertakethe additional risks and procedures that accompany third-flag, non-associateservice. These flag-based burdens make for uneconomic decision-making onthe part of shippers which distorts the Trade.We therefore conclude that the conditions unfavorable to shipping whichthe Commission found in the December 1987 Final Rule continue to exist.Although the specific GOP enactments which brought into being the unfavorableconditions the Commission sought to deal with in the December 1987 FinalRule have been repealed, they have been replaced by, or have reinstatedby default, a cargo reservation system which continues to have an onerousand detrimental impact on shipping in the Trade. The fundamental basisfor the December 1987 Final Rule and the final rule herein-issued is thesame: the injurious effects on carriers, shippers and the Trade generallywhich result from laws, decrees and regulations of the GOP that imposeburdens on non-Peruvian-flag carriers which are not experienced by Peruvian-flagcarriers. These burdens are among the conditions described as unfavorableto shipping in the Commission's Section 19 rules at 46 CFR 585.3. We areconvinced that Trade access by non-Peruvian-flag carriers and the concomitantability of shippers to freely exercise their best commercial judgment inchoosing a carrier in the Trade have not materially improved, despite thenumerous changes in the amount of cargo putatively affected and the formof the burdens imposed, <T3>e.g., </T3>waivers, authorizations, certifications. The Commission's March 1987 Proposed Rule and its December 1987 Final Rulewould have suspended the tariffs of the Peruvian-flag carriers. Almostall of the parties who subsequently commented in this proceeding, includingNedlloyd, expressed a desire to avoid disruption of the Trade. In its comments filed in August 1988, Nedlloyd proposed alternative sanctionswhich would have required Peruvian-flag carriers to obtain waivers fromthe FMC for the carriage of cargo, and to file periodic reports with theCommission. Nedlloyd's purpose in proposing these sanctions was to constructa ``mirror image'' of the burdens imposed by the GOP decrees and to avoidthe disruption of service in the Trade which would follow if the Commissionsuspended the tariffs of certain Peruvian-flag carriers, as earlier prescribed.Comments filed in response to Nedlloyd's proposal pointed out that thealternative sanctions would burden not only the Peruvian-flag carriersbut shippers and the FMC as well. While the Commission has in the past,whenever possible, sought to meet conditions unfavorable to shipping inthe U.S. trades by mirroring the burdens imposed, we must agree with thesecommenters. The sanctions proposed by Nedlloyd, moreover, would requireresources exceeding those available to the Commission. Section 10002 of the Foreign Shipping Practices Act of 1988 (``1988 Act''),102 Stat. 1570, Pub. L. 100-418, authorizes the Commission to assess feesof up to $1 million per voyage in proceedings conducted under section 19.\20\<NOTE/> Based on the evident agreement among commenters that tariffsuspension would unduly disrupt the Trade, and the impracticability ofthe alternative suggested by Nedlloyd, the Commission has elected to substitutea system of per voyage fees in the final rule as a means of meeting orcountervailing the effects of the GOP cargo reservation system presentlyin effect under Decree 036-82. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ The Foreign Shipping Practices Act, andSection; 10002(e)(1)authorizes the Commission to take ``such action as it considers necessaryand appropriate'' against a foreign carrier who has been found, or whosegovernment has been found, to have created conditions which adversely affectthe operations of United States carriers and do not exist for such foreigncarriers in their operations in the United States, and states that suchactions may include, among others enumerated, ``a fee, not to exceed $1,000,000per voyage''. Section 10002(h) of the 1988 Act provides that the actionsagainst foreign carriers authorized in subsection (e) may be used in theadministration and enforcement of Section 19. Thus, the 1988 Act sets forthexamples of actions which the Commission may take in proceedings underthat Act or under Section 19, but neither limits the Commission to theactions enumerated or establishes standards for Commission determinationof what constitutes ``necessary and appropriate'' action. These matterscontinue to be left to the Commission's discretion.The Commission notes the concern expressed by CSAV that the Chilean-flagcarriers_the erstwhile victims of GOP cargo reservation under Decree 009-86_nowoperating in the Trade as associate carriers pursuant to agreements withPeruvian-flag carriers, not be victimized by the imposition of sanctionson the Peruvian-flag carriers. In order to avoid this possible result,the Commission has directed in the Final Rule that the fees assessed shallbe paid by Peruvian-flag carriers from their own revenues, without affectingthe revenue shares of non-Peruvian-flag carriers participating in jointoperations pursuant to agreements on file with the Commission. We believe the level of the fees assessed herein would provide a meansof adjusting the unfavorable conditions found but would also avoid seriousdisruption to the Trade generally. Therefore, in order to redress the detrimentalcompetitive effects of the decrees and regulations of the GOP, the Commissionherein assesses fees to be paid by the Peruvian-flag carriers_the chiefbeneficiaries of the GOP decrees_in connection with each voyage made byor on behalf of such a carrier in the Trade.  Although the Commission believes this action is justified under section19 to meet or adjust the conditions described above, particularly giventhe passage of more than three years since these conditions were firstbrought to our attention, we also recognize that this Commission does notoperate in a vacuum. As our general rules make clear, proceedings undersection 19 necessarily touch upon, and are not themselves immune to, theconcerns of U.S. foreign policy assigned by statute to other governmententities. <T3>See e.g.</T3>, 46 CFR 585.8 and 585.13. News articles recently appearing in a number of publications have madeus aware that the shipping and foreign oceanborne trade with which we areconcerned may also be affected by other events in Peru. Therefore, at theCommission's request, the Office of Andean Affairs of the Department ofState (``Department'' or ``DOS'') provided a briefing on current economicand political conditions in Peru. The briefing touched on the economicpolicies of the GOP, including its policies concerning foreign debt, andthe effects of inflation; the role of the Peruvian military, particularlywith respect to control of the guerilla insurgency; the outlook for Presidentialelections which will next occur in May, 1990; and U.S. foreign policy withrespect to Peru.  The Department brought to the Commission's attention economic and politicalconcerns affecting U.S. foreign policy as well as, in the DOS' view, beinglikely to affect the Commission's assessment of the efficacy of measuresto meet or adjust the conditions unfavorable to shipping found to existin the U.S./Peru trade. The information provided did not address the meritsof the issues directly before the Commission in this proceeding. The DOSdid not present views on the existence of conditions unfavorable to shippingor whether particular types of Commission action would be appropriate tomeet or adjust such conditions.  Notwithstanding the Commission's conclusion that action pursuant to section19 is warranted in this proceeding, and its formulation of sanctions tomeet or adjust the conditions found, the Commission is not putting thosesanctions into effect at least at this time, because of the political andeconomic environment existing in Peru. As described to us in the DOS briefing,and as appears generally from reports we read in the press, economic andother conditions exist in Peru which threaten the stability of Peruvianinstitutions and the democratically elected government itself. We are concernedthat our action might have undesirable side effects on foreign policy matters,outside of our own statutory focus on shipping, which affect national interestsgenerally that are legitimately of concern to the U.S. Department of State.The detrimental effects of the GOP's cargo reservation decrees presentlybeing experienced by U.S. shipping interests, as described to us by SCOTfor example, arise from their exclusionary impact on a non-U.S.-flag andnon-U.S.-owned carrier. In addition, these U.S. shippers, whose concernsled to the initiation of this proceeding, are not now advocating the immediateimposition of sanctions in the Trade. Therefore, it appears particularlyprudent for us, in balancing the myriad of commercial and national considerationshere, to take into account more general U.S. interests in determining theappropriate timing of our action in this proceeding.  Moreover, because of the unsettled internal situation in Peru, the desiredfinancial impact of the Commission's Final Rule might well be lost amongthe other economic dislocations presently being experienced in that countryby Peruvian-flag carriers and the GOP itself. As a result, it is likelythat effecting such action at this time would, in any event, not bringabout the desired easing of barriers to an open trade.For reasons set forth above, the Commission is therefore deferring theeffectiveness of the sanctions imposed in this proceeding until furthernotice. The Commission will continue to monitor these matters and will,when appropriate, issue a further order establishing an effective datefor the final rule or taking such other action as appears advisable atthe time. We will expect the parties who have previously commented in thisproceeding, including Nedlloyd and SCOT, as well as the Department of State(whether through its Office of Andean Affairs or its participation in thecomments of the Executive Agencies) to assist us by keeping us informedas to the changing state of affairs in Peru. The Commission will considerthe request for action of any person but will determine, in its discretion,a propitious time to effectuate the final rule. In the interim we would,of course, continue to encourage the GOP to take whatever action is necessaryto remove the unfavorable conditions herein found to exist in order toobviate any need for the Commission to put into effect countervailing remedies.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Rule </ITAG>For the reasons stated above the Commission finds it necessary and appropriateto issue a rule, pursuant to section 19, to adjust or meet conditions describedabove which it finds unfavorable to shipping in the Trade (``Final Rule'').However, notwithstanding the issuance of the Final Rule at this time, theCommission for reasons also explained above, is deferring its effectivedate until further notice. The Final Rule will require the Peruvian-flag carriers operating in theTrade, with the exception of NAPSA which operates only a U.S./Iquitos,Peru service, to pay a fee for each voyage completed in the Trade as ameans of countervailing the detrimental conditions imposed on U.S. tradeby the practices of the Government of Peru. NAPSA service in the U.S./Iquitostrade is not being subjected to these fees because the Commission has foundthis subtrade distinguishable from the Trade generally, and therefore entitledto different treatment. The considerations which underlay this determinationin connection with the December 1987 Final Rule continue to apply to NAPSA'sservice in this subtrade. The Final Rule will require that Peruvian-flag carriers pay to the Commissiona fee of $50,000 for each voyage on which cargo is carried on a vesselowned or operated by or on behalf of a Peruvian-flag carrier, or undera Peruvian-flag carrier's bill of lading for service performed by anothercarrier pursuant to an agreement on file with the Commission. Such feesshall be paid to the Commission within 7 days of the completion of eachvoyage subject to this Rule. Each Peruvian-flag carrier shall, in addition,file a report with the Commission within 15 days of the end of each calendarquarter certifying that all penalties due have been paid and setting forththe dates of voyages made, amounts of cargo carried, and amounts of feespaid, for the calendar quarter. If a Peruvian-flag carrier fails to paythe required fees, or to submit the required report and certification,within the prescribed time period, its tariffs on file with the Commissionwill be suspended 30 days subsequent to the end of the calendar quarterin which the fees or report were due. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 46 CFR Part 586 </ITAG>Cargo vessels, Exports, Foreign relations, Imports, Maritime carriers,Penalties, Rates and fares; Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

(b) GOP law provides that non-Peruvian-flag carriers must become associatecarriers or obtain cargo from shippers who have secured waivers for individualshipments or certification of cargo shipped, to operate in the Trade.
