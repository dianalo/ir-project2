Dave Porter, a spokesman for Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, saidState Department officials had confirmed the Soviet team wasexpected in Utah today for a two-day review. An American contingentwas to conduct a similar tour in the Soviet Union.   Porter said the Soviet technicians planned to tour Magna, about25 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, this afternoon. He saidspecific details were not available.   Magna, population 8,500, is a few miles from the HerculesBacchus West plant. Up to 30 Soviet inspectors may establish acompound near the plant if the Senate ratifies the INF treaty,signed Dec. 7 by President Reagan and Soviet leader MikhailGorbachev.   The treaty would eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weaponryin both countries' arsenals.   The countries' inspection teams could be in place within 60 daysof the treaty's ratifications, officials say.   The Soviets would monitor Hercules, which developed motors forthe Pershing II missiles, banned under the treaty, from 1979 to1987.   The Soviet technicians will be accompanied by four members ofthe State Department's On-Site Inspection Agency, Porter said.   Today, the Soviets will make a ``very general visit to (Magna).It will just be the town, the stores, just to get a feeling for thearea,'' he said.   On Thursday, the three technicians will conduct a similar tourof Salt Lake City and then leave Friday, Porter said. He said nonews conferences or statements were planned.   The Soviet and American advance teams will meet in Moscow a weekafter the tours to discuss housing, travel and other arrangements,Hatch's office said.   Pershing II missile motors no longer are built at Hercules, butthe company has a contract for third-stage motors for theintercontinental MX missile.</TEXT></DOC>
