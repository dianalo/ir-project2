But traders said the gains were pared by profit-taking amid skepticism about the OPEC pact, which limits production to 16.6 million barrels a day in the third and fourth quarters.    &quot;The problem is that the OPEC numbers are fictional&quot; because of possible additional production by cartel members, said Andrew Lebow, oil analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York.    The market's early enthusiasm was damped by the reality that &quot;when you discuss the agreement, you realize that OPEC has to cut production to get to 16.6 million barrels,&quot; said Rick Donovan, head of E.F. Hutton andamp; Co.'s international energy department in New York.    Alhough OPEC's quota is currently 15.8 million barrels a day, the cartel is actually producing about 17 million barrels a day because of excess output by some members, traders say.    &quot;If 16.6 were 16.6, the market would be skyrocketing,&quot; Mr. Lebow said. The market isn't, and that &quot;shows that traders are skeptical.&quot;    Crude oil for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after rising to an early high of $20.70, closed at $20.35 a barrel, up nine cents on the day. Heating oil and unleaded gasoline futures prices also rose, but closed well below their intraday highs.    On the spot, or non-contract, market, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, rose 10 cents a barrel to $20.35, while North Sea Brent, the abundantly traded European blend, rose 10 cents a barrel to $19.20 in late trading.    The day's highs came in frenzied trading at the market's opening, traders and analysts said, with crude oil futures prices immediately bid about 46 cents above Friday's closing price.    &quot;It was total pandemonium -- it reminded me of a bazaar at Old Delhi,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, energy futures analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York.    The initial buying spurt was attributable in part to traders scrambling to cover selling positions left open Friday, analysts and brokers said.    &quot;There were still some stragglers who thought the (OPEC) deal maybe would fall apart over the weekend,&quot; Mr. Lebow said.    As the day wore on, prices softened amid profit-taking, with crude at the New York Merc closing just a nickel above the day's low of $20.30 a barrel.    Still, the OPEC agreement portends relatively firm prices for much of the year, analysts said. While short-term sell-offs are likely, many traders expect gradually higher prices in the coming months.    &quot;The agreement clearly is bullish, but the bottom line is that it's only as good as OPEC's discipline is,&quot; said Hutton's Mr. Donovan. &quot;If it's solid, prices will trade higher.&quot;    In other futures markets yesterday:    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Forecasts of rain and normal temperatures throughout much of the Midwest this week sent corn and soybean futures prices tumbling. The news was particularly bearish for corn, which is entering its pollination stage, when rain and normal temperatures would benefit the crop. Meanwhile, the weakness in the corn and soybean markets pulled down wheat prices.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Pork belly futures prices plunged, and contracts for summer delivery were down their daily limits, amid traders' expectations that today's hog and pig report will be bearish. The Agriculture Department is scheduled to release the report, as well as a national cattle inventory report, after the market's close. Analysts predict the hog and pig report will show the industry is in the midst of an expansion that could increase pork supplies almost immediately. The cattle report is expected to show the industry is in transition, having ceased liquidating the nation's herd, but without significant building as of yet. Cattle futures were mixed.    INTEREST RATES: Treasury bond futures prices rose half a point in moderate trading, in response to &quot;general weakness in commodity prices,&quot; said Frederick Leiner, a Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. analyst in Chicago. The trading also reflected an easing of the selling pressure that weighed on the market during last week's Treasury refunding, when the Treasury Department auctioned more than $29 billion of short and intermediate-term securities, Mr. Leiner said. With little fundamental news to influence the market, prices also rose amid rumors the Reagan administration was nearing some form of accommodation with Congress on the twin issues of taxes and the federal budget deficit, said Norman Mains, a Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. analyst in Chicago.    COPPER: Reflecting the overall firmness of the market, futures prices recovered half their early losses, which an analyst said were tied to profit-taking. Today will be the first day for issuing of notices of intention to deliver copper against the July contract, and some overly cautious speculators who previously bought contracts were thought to be sellers, analysts said. &quot;Once this first wave of selling is over, it should become apparent that most of the rest of the July contracts are in strong hands that won't be so ready to run in view&quot; of the tightness in near-term supply, an analyst said. Signaling that tightness, the July contract continued to maintain its premium over other months and, in fact, gained 0.15 cent over the September. The July contract settled at 70.8 cents a pound, for a loss of 0.5 cent, while September settled at 70.45 cents for a drop of 0.65 cent.    SUGAR: Futures prices closed near the day's lows as burdensome supplies continue to weigh on the market. Apparently the support created by recent demand in the world market couldn't be sustained, said William O'Neill, research director at Elders Futures Inc. in New York. There was significant buying of sugar in the past two weeks, Mr. O'Neill noted, including an estimated 500,000 metric tons by China. &quot;Yet, once this demand was out of the way, the oversupply situation was a depressant once again,&quot; he said. A three-month world supply is regarded as normal, and supplies currently represent 4 to 4 1/2 months' use. A metric ton is equal to 1.1 U.S. short tons, or 2,204.6 pounds. Meanwhile, since May northern and western European sugarbeet-producing countries have had wet and cool weather, about four to eight degrees below normal, said James Roemer, meteorologist at Weather Trades Inc. in Des Moines, Iowa. &quot;It isn't a problem yet,&quot; Mr. Roemer said, &quot;but beets need dry, sunny summer weather to increase their sugar content.&quot; Forecasts are for improving weather, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
