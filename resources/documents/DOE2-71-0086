Attempts to increase thedosage of radiation to the cancer cells with less damage to the normaltissue cells have been made for remedying the above metioned weakpoint.Glutathione was reported to have a radioprotective effect and has beenused for the above purpose. In this paper glutathione was used to investigateits radioprotective effect. The 3rd generation isotransplants of theC/sub 3/H/He mouse mammary carcinoma was used as an experimental model.The experiment was performed with intraperitoneal administration of glutathioneby x-ray irradiation under aerobic or hypoxic condition when the tumorhad reached to 250 mm/sup 3/ in size. Assay method was checked by TRT-50.TRT was defined as the time required for a tumor to regrow to its initialvolume. Tumor growth was measured every day and TRT-50 was calculatedby logit method on the basis of TRT frequency. Under hypoxic conditionwith 40 Gy irradiation, TRT-50 of the tumor treated with glutathioneof 1.5, 3.0, 4.5 mg/g. b. wt. was 26.9, 25.5, 21.5 days respectively,while that of untreated was 28.2 days. Under aerobic condition with 40Gy irradiation, TRT-50 of tumor treated with glutathione of 3.0 mg/g.b. wt. was 14.1 days while that of untreated was 19.1 days. Under aerobiccondition with fractional irradiation of 5 Gy x 5. TRT-50 of tumor treatedwith glutathione of 3.0 mg/g. b. wt. was 10.5 days while that of untreatedone was 12.6 days. The above results suggests (1) shortening of the TRT-50with glutathione, (2) dosage dependency of glutathione and (3) no differenceof the effect was observed between single and fractional x-ray irradiationand between the level of oxygenation.</TEXT></DOC>
