 In conducting its work, certainly, the governmentemploys thousands and thousands of computer users and compiles massiveamounts of data, much of it sensitive information related to such weightymatters as national defense, economic policy, and space exploration, to namebut a few.andP;  And yes, this sensitive data has to be protected fromunauthorized use.andP;  It is apparent that security is an issue of governmentalconcern.andM;But there are many other organizations--both private and public commercialbusinesses--for which computer data security is becoming more and moreimportant.andP;  For the sake of discussion, we can divide such organizations intothree general computer-security domains:andM;* the quasi-government sector, in which the government reviews anorganization's security programs;andM;* the financial-institutions sector, governed through a variety of federal,state, and local regulations;andM;* the remaining corporate organizations, which are the object of little or nosecurity review by any outside entity other than an external auditing firm.andM;Interestingly, as one progresses through these categories there appears to beprogressively less interest among the parties most involved in ensuring thesecurity of the information systems they use.andM;Companies of the first category--the quasi-government sector, includingcontractors providing services to the government--are required by governmentregulation to take measures to protect their physical and data-processingenvironments.andP;  They are subject to inspection and may lose governmentcontracts if their controls over computer security are judged inadequate.andO;Non-compliance threatens the regulated companies' financial viability, ofcourse, and the potential for loss of revenue motivates companies to takecomputer security seriously.andP;  This general observation doesn't apply acrossthe board in the quasi-government sector, but many workers in the fieldbelieve that management will most often do only what government regulationsrequire, and nothing more.andM;Until the recent publication of new regulations, the second sector--thefinancial community--based its security programs on the degree of risk ofdata loss.andP;  Financial institutions have always been aware that both externaland internal elements work to make unauthorized and undetected withdrawals offunds.andP;  &quot;Security practitioners&quot; in the business of finance have tried todocument the potential loss, to determine the cost to reduce that loss to anacceptable level, and to have senior management make decisions about how muchrisk it is willing to assume.andM;Managers in most corporations evaluate risk on a daily basis.andP;  They decidethe credit-worthiness of individuals, the risk of investing in new branchesor lines of business, and so forth.andP;  In corporate America, it is seniormanagement's job to make good risk decisions, after all.andP;  Therefore, thecomputer security specialist's primary responsibilities are to educatemanagement on data security risks and to establish a generally acceptedbaseline of controls within a given organization.andM;The diversity inherent in the third category of organizations makes it a moredifficult area to discuss.andP;  Again, however, the sophistication of the systemcontrols in place in a given company depends on how well computer securityspecialists have done their job--how well senior management and corporateemployees have been educated, and how much money management has been madeavailable for security.andP;  The controls in place in such organizations areoften quite rudimentary, or non-existent, compared to those implemented inthe quasi-government category.andM;In any security program, two components must work efficiently if success isto be assured.andP;  The first encompasses the security tools and policiesestablished to maintain control over the assets being protected.andP;  The secondis the human beings doing the controlling or being controlled.andP;  In thequasi-government, financial, and mixed sectors, the effectiveness of thesecomponents varies greatly.andM;The Quasi-Government Domain.andP;  In the government domain itself, unlike in thecorporate world, there is intense interest in perfecting a secure operatingsystem.andP;  Witness the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria, therenowned &quot;Orange Book&quot; developed by the Department of Defense and used bymost government agencies and related organizations.andP;  Awareness thatunfriendly foreign and domestic parties pose a real and imminent threat toinformation contained in these systems--and thus to national security--isbehind this intense interest and effort.andP;  As many of us have read in the pastyear, the threat is real, and unauthorized access with malicious intent doesoccur.andP;  Government agencies and the organizations that do business with themhave been the victims of virus, worm, and hacker attacks, such as the ScoresVirus, the Internet Worm, and the Chaos Computer Club's hacking attack onnumerous DEC systems.andM;In addition to the Orange Book, regulations have been established thatmandate both the control of information and the provision of &quot;awarenessprograms&quot; for those who process the information.andP;  Unfortunately, thegovernment has neglected to provide funding for the education of thepopulation to be governed by these new regulations.andM;The lack of funding for training programs mean users are unable toparticipate fully in the security system.andP;  Users of an organization'sinformation who desire nothing more than to keep that information secureoften receive minimal training, and they may not understand what theorganization expects of them.andP;  They are not aware that they are every bit asaccountable for the security of the organization's information as thetechnology behind the security program is--nor have they been fully educatedabout the information's value or threats to its security.andP;  Without the humanpart of the equation supporting the protection of the organization'sinformation, even the most technically elegant secure operating system willfail.andP;  In the quasi-government domain, therefore, organizations must focus onboth the technological and human components of security programs.andM;The Financial Sector.andP;  Many large institutions in the financial sector havedeveloped programs that rival, and in many cases surpass, the sophisticatedprograms in place in government organizations.andP;  In recent mandates toinitiate protection programs, the Comptroller of the Currency, in the officeof the Administrator of National Banks, issued Banking Circulars 226 and 229,both of which state that protection of information is essential to thefinancial well-being of banking institutions, and is an obligation of theorganization to its shareholders.andP;  Both banking circulars establish that if aloss is suffered and adequate controls have not been established, theofficers and directors of the organization are personally liable.andP;  Financialinstitutions, like government organizations, have something that attractsboth internal and external interest: money.andP;  Attacks against financialinstitutions have resulted in multimillion-dollar losses.andP;  (See the articleon page 62 for more information on Banking Circulars 226 and 229.)andM;Many large financial institutions not only have technologically sophisticatedsecurity programs in place to protect their operating systems and networks,but they also have set up educational programs for their information users.andO;Unfortunately, this balanced approach seems to be limited to the largestinstitutions; many smaller firms don't have this balance.andP;  In fact, many haveboth minimal system protection and employee education.andP;  These institutions,regardless of their size, face the same kinds of threats, but the effects ofa loss on many of the smaller entities would be particularly devastating.andO;The same regulations apply to large and small institutions; unfortunately,smaller institutions seem to have fewer resources to dedicate to securityprograms.andM;Other Industries.andP;  In this third domain--those miscellaneous organizationsnot fitting into the previous two categories--the level of interest in andthe quality of security programs are typically high for one or both of tworeasons: management foresight, or the occurrence of an internal or externalattack.andP;  In either case, this domain is not accountable in the wayquasi-governmental and financial institutions are to provide either systemprotection or employee-awareness programs.andP;  What does exist for this domain,as well as for the other two, is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977,something many senior executives have largely forgotten.andP;  This act actuallyapplies to all US companies, regardless of industry, gross income, or scopeof marketplace.andP;  It mandates that businesses take measures to guarantee thesecurity and integrity of assets, including (or so it has been interpreted)accounting and ledger information stored and processed on electronicdata-processing systems.andM;So even when there is a regulation that covers almost every business entity,the majority of senior executives are not aware of the mandate.andP;  Even whenthey are aware of it, they too often think it is not applicable to theirparticular type of business.andP;  They are wrong.andP;  The 1977 act applies to all UScompanies, and officers of corporations may face substantial personal finessand even imprisonment if they are found to be in violation of this law.andM;Causes of Security Component Failures.andP;  In all three of the sectors discussedabove, unfortunately, serious lossed have occurred because of failures in oneor both of the necessary security-program components.andP;  In most cases, thefailure appears to be the result of human rather than computer error.andO;Failure to implement controls (or failure to implement them properly), use ofsimple and easily guessed passwords, failure to correct known system flaws,and failure to follow established operating procedures are reasons why majorsecurity infractions have occurred in the past 10 years.andP;  Seldom has anysophisticated attack been used to compromise a system.andP;  In most cases, theprover-bial door was left open and the intruder just walked in.andM;Requirements For Successful Security Programs.andP;  Within each organization,security practitioners must strive to establish effective controls overinformation asserts in a manner consistent with and supportive of theparticular culture of the organization.andP;  Unlike the government, corporationsgenerally do not mandate compliance; even when they do, penalties fornon-compliance are much less severe than are government penalties.andP;  In thecorporate environment, employees comply when they understand why controlsneed to be put in place, what is expected of them, and how it is to theirbenefit to comply.andP;  In most corporations, disciplinary action is taken onlywhen serious, intentional deviations from policy come to light.andP;  The successof most corporate programs depends greatly on the technological controlsimplemented--these are invisible, in large part, to the system users--andeven more on how the employees within the organization embrace and supportthe program.andM;Now that many organizations are &quot;downsizing&quot; (a vogue term for reducingstaff), they may not be able to adhere to the basic principles of informationprotection, such as separtion of duties, peer review of work, and the like.andO;New technologies like computer-aided software engineering (CASE) aresignificantly modifying the traditional life-cycle review process.andP;  Systemsthat used to be under the control of data-center personnel are now movinginto the office environment.andP;  These smaller systems approach the processingcapabilities of second-genration mainframe systems and are now managed byoffice personnel.andP;  Even with adequate system-protection controls installed,successful control of the environment now often depends on employees who havelittle or no data-processing experience.andM;In the three domains of the corporate computer security environment, thefocus needs to be on the human factors that help ensure a successful program:andM;* senior management's overt support of the program;andM;* education of employees;andM;* participation of all members of the organization;andM;* acknowledged/recognized effort of employees and security staff.andM;Management must be highly visible in its support for protection of thecorporation's information.andP;  Top managers must require personal accountabilityon the part of their subordinates to effectively manage corporate informationassets.andP;  Senior management must lead the effort by setting the example.andM;The education of all the employees of the corporation, not to mention theircooperation, is critical to a program's success.andP;  Companies withwell-established, effective awareness programs that have the support ofemployees are recognized as being more effective in their total protectionprograms.andP;  Employees want to participate in corporate programs.andP;  They wantand need to understand why certain information needs to be protected, whatthe threats to that information are, how can it be compromised, and whateffect a compromise could have on their jobs.andP;  Often, employees fail tocomply with programs either because they are not aware of theirresponsibility or because they do not understand why the information needs tobe protected.andM;The distribution of information throughout a large organization provides theill-intentioned with many opportunities to compromise that information.andP;  Theprotection of information residing on data-processing systems is only aportion of the total protection program.andP;  Information is vulnerable from thetime an idea is uttered, through the process of documenting it into automatedsystems through all the operations of that system, to the output, and finallyto the disposal or destruction of that used information.andP;  Throughout thiscomplex process, many people are involved in the generation, use, management,manipulation, and disposal of information.andP;  Each has an opportunity toprotect or compromise that information.andP;  Whether they do one or the other maydepend on their understanding of the value of their contribution to theprogram and the value of the asset they are using.andM;Recognition is a powerful motivator.andP;  According to experts in human behavior,in fact, it is one of the most powerful motivators of all.andP;  Positiverecognition of employees who support the protection of information, whocontribute creative ideas to the program, who identify system deficienciesand/or provide corrective solutions is more effective that holding a &quot;policyax&quot;, poised to drop at the first hint of non-compliance, over employees'necks.andP;  Punishment has its place, certainly, but by itself it has littleeffect in motivating employees to look for ways to protect information.andP;  Infact, punishment should be viewed as the last resort in preventing deviantbehavior.andM;The organization with professional security staff should also have arecognition program for the contributions of these professionals to theprotection of the corporate information assets.andP;  Their creativity, patience,and persistence form the cornerstone of the program.andM;This article puts forth the opinions of a computer security practitioner who,as a novice in this intriguing field of computer security, embraced withgreat fervor the deployment of software and technology as &quot;the solution&quot; tothe mission of protecting the information resident on corporatedata-processing systems.andP;  After nearly twenty years in this field I havefound that, as important as technology is in providing a foundation forcomputer security programs, awareness, support, and participation by themanagement and employees of a company are as important as technology inensuring security.andM;There must be a balance between investment in the technical portion of aprotection program and the human factors that can either support or underminethe technology.andP;  The technical side of the equation remains fairly constant,so the balance of the program is more heavily dependent on human factors.andO;Increased emphasis on educational programs increases the effectiveness oftechnical controls; decreased emphasis lowers the effectiveness.andM;On the equation's technical side, very little can be done to compensateeffectively for deficiencies on the human side.andP;  Nevertheless, ascorporations struggle to obtain this balance between technological controlsand effective employee programs, system developers must keep in mind that theexistence and quality of controls within their products must be in placewhile the human programs are still being developed.andM;Colen Emerson has spent two decades working on domestic and internationalassignments related to computer security, including work in the areas ofencryption, disaster-recovery planni ng, training, and project management.andO;He is a member of the American Society for Industrial Security and theNational Computer Security Committee, and formerly president of the LosAngeles chapter of the Information Systems Security Association.andP;  He is alsoa senior management systems consultant with the Information Security Programat SRI International.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
