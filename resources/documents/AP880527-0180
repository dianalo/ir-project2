(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman was sentenced Friday to 14years in prison by a judge who blamed cocaine and teen-agemotherhood for the tragedy that resulted in her 9-year-old daughterlosing her legs to frostbite when she was locked in an unheatedapartment.   Workers boarding up an abandoned, unheated Gary house Jan. 17discovered Darlwin Carlisle alone and pleading for help from abarricaded apartment. Surgeons who amputated her legs below theknee said gangrene had set in four to five days before she wasfound.   Her mother, Darlwin Britt, 25, pleaded guilty May 6 to felonychild neglect, over the objections of her attorney, in a pleaagreement that dropped two other counts and avoided a trial inwhich her daughter would have had to testify against her.   ``I think it's probable this wouldn't have happened but forcocaine,'' said Lake Superior Court Judge Richard W. Maroc.Nevertheless, he said she appeared to love the child she had whenshe was 15.   ``When we're talking about children having children and drugsbeing involved, is it any wonder these things happen?'' he said.   Ms. Britt admitted to cocaine use and asked Maroc whether shewould be sent to a drug rehabilitation center for treatment. Hetold her he would recommend that she receive counseling andtreatment in prison.   Maroc said Ms. Britt had no criminal record, but he added fouryears to the standard 10-year term, citing the length of time thechild was left in the freezing apartment and her permanentdisability.   Investigators said the girl had been in the apartment for nearly10 days during a bitter cold spell of near-zero temperatures.During that time, Ms. Britt told school officials her daughter wasmissing classes because of a cut on her foot, Maroc said.   The court accepted the plea bargain over the objections ofdefense attorney Daniel Toomey, who said prosecutors lackedsufficient evidence to show Ms. Britt intended to harm her daughter.   He said Ms. Britt accepted the bargain because she fearedreceiving the maximum 20-year sentence if she were convicted by ajury.   Under questioning by Maroc, Ms. Britt repeated her willingnessto accept the deal, saying, ``I don't want to go to trial.''   She offered no explanation, but the Rev. Cozetta Olive, aminister who has counseled Ms. Britt, said she woman wanted tospare her daughter further trauma.   Child welfare authorities placed Darlwin Carlisle in the home ofher paternal grandmother, Katie Carlisle of Gary.   ``Her physical recovery is superb,'' said Deputy ProsecutorKaren Coulis. ``Her emotional recovery will be much longer, perhapsfor life.''</TEXT></DOC>
