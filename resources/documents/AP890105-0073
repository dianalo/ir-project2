Barry Jr. said today he is notafraid of anything that might come out of the current investigationinto whether he interfered with a police drug probe.   Barry's telephone records, along with other city records, havebeen subpoenaed by the U.S. attorney's office in its investigation.   ``I'm not afraid of anything that might come out of this,'' Barrysaid in an interview on WOL radio.   Referring to investigations of several years ago by former U.S.Attorney Joseph DiGenova, Barry said DiGenova ``spent $30 millioninvestigating my administration and very little came out of that.''   Barry, who denies having tried to disrupt the drug investigation,will be questioned about the matter, possibly this week, accordingto sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified.   In a statement issued Wednesday, Barry said: ``We welcome thisinvestigation. The district government will cooperate fully ... andwill comply with any subpoenas the grand jury may issue.''   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that a federalgrand jury has also subpoenaed thousands of documents relating to ajoint D.C.-Virgin Islands personnel project. The former manager ofthe project, Charles Lewis, is a key figure in the current Barrycase.   Barry, who has faced repeated allegations of personal improprietyin his 10 years as mayor of the nation's capital, is facing his mostserious political crisis yet following disclosures that he met lastmonth with a man who was the subject of a city police druginvestigation.   Sources familiar with the investigation said the records soughtby the U.S. attorney's office cover calls placed from the telephonein Barry's automobile, as well as calls placed in other ways thatwould generate a record. Those would include calls made throughpolice and city switchboards.   Barry has acknowledged calling the assistant police chief, IsaacFulwood, who is supervising the investigation, but has said he wastrying to speed up the probe and not influence its outcome.   The records search involves any calls that may have been madearound the time last month when Barry has acknowledged visiting aWashington hotel room occupied by Lewis.   District of Columbia police called off an attempt to make anundercover purchase of drugs from Lewis after two detectivesencountered one of the mayor's security guards while Barry was atthe hotel, authorities have said.   Police said a later search of the room, after Lewis checked out,found traces of cocaine, but there was no indication how long theyhad been there.   Barry has denied any drug use but admitted ``poor judgment.''   Also sought in the federal investigation are records of calls byChief of Police Maurice Turner and other city officials, includingtape recordings of calls through the police dispatcher's phonesystem.   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens said last week that his office wasconducting a full investigation of the allegations against Barry,including whether he used drugs or tried to hinder a policeinvestigation.   Meanwhile, the inspector general of the U.S. Interior Departmentis conducting a separate investigation into an agreement in whichBarry and other D.C. officials were to provide consulting servicesto the Virgin Islands on personnel issues. Lewis was in charge ofthat agreement for the Virgin Islands government.   Stephens, asked about the search for telephone records, said hecould not comment on matters under investigation.   Police department spokesman Shannon Cockett, spokeswoman forTurner, said, ``We will not comment while the U.S. attorney's officeis investigating this matter.''   Barry, elected three times by large majorities, came up throughthe ranks of local civil rights leaders in the 1960s to become themayor of the heavily black city in 1978.   Barry, who is married, acknowledged last year he once had a``personal'' relationship with a convicted cocaine dealer, KarenJohnson. He denied using drugs or purchasing them from her, however,and denied allegations she had been paid hush money to prevent herfrom talking to federal investigators.   At the same time, Barry has sought to be a visible leader in thecity's battle against drugs, appearing at anti-drug rallies withJesse Jackson and police officials. The city recorded a record 371homicides last year, more than half of which police said were drugrelated.   Lewis has remained unavailable for comment since the Dec. 22hotel incident, but sources say he has been in contact with federalinvestigators.   He is a former city government official and a native of theVirgin Islands who was fired in April from his job as assistant tothe governor of the Virgin Islands.</TEXT></DOC>
