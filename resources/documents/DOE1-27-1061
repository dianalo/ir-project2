The materials were a PuO/sub 2/ feedstock treatedat 850{sup 0}C and a solid solution of uranium and plutonium ((U, Pu)O/sub2/) treated at 1750{sup 0}C collected from gloveboxes at a mixed oxidefuel fabrication facility. Groups of rats received a single inhalationexposure to achieve graded levels of initial pulmonary burden and weremaintained for lifespan observation. Cancers of the lung, both carcinomasand sarcomas, were the major effects seen. Incidences of these cancerswere similar at comparable levels of initial pulmonary burden for thetwo materials. Crude incidence of lung cancers for rats exposed to eitherof these materials was not different than that reported for similar studiesusing laboratory produced PuO/sub 2/. The doubling dose for lung cancersafter exposure to PuO/sub 2/ or (U, Pu)O/sub 2/ was 0.78 +- 0.63 Gy tolung to median lifespan. These studies indicate that the risks of lungcancer from inhaled mixed oxide fuels and PuO/sub 2/ are the same.</TEXT></DOC>
