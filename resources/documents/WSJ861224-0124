LublinStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/24/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LABORLABOR DEPARTMENT (LBR) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Labor Department hearing officer ruled that Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank of Chicago engaged in discriminatory hiring and promotion practices.    The ruling by chief administrative law judge Nahum Litt could force the bank, a unit of Harris Bankcorp, to spend $12.2 million or more on back pay. His decision requires another administrative proceeding to determine the bank's precise liability. The bank then can appeal to the labor secretary and to the courts.    &quot;Harris discriminated against women and minorities in initial placement and salaries,&quot; Mr. Litt said in his 88-page ruling. &quot;The combined weight of statistical and anecdotal evidence in this case is overwhelming.    Harris Trust has been involved in a 12-year battle with the Labor Department over its treatment of women and minorities. The latest decision upholds a 1981 order by another departmental hearing officer that suggested the bank should spend $12.2 million on back pay to correct job bias.    In May 1983, then-Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan tossed out the 1981 decision, saying the bank hadn't been allowed to present certain statistical studies. Another administrative hearing took place that included that evidence, according to a Labor Department spokeswoman.    Mr. Litt's proposed back-pay proceeding possibly &quot;will result in an order in excess of $12.2 million,&quot; George Salem, the Labor Department's solicitor, or top attorney, said in an interview. &quot;This case has been going on forever,&quot; he said. &quot;But this is a major victory today. A liability has been determined . . . after all the evidence excluded before was admitted.&quot;    The 1981 ruling concurred with a December 1977 administrative complaint against the bank. That complaint contended that Harris Trust should give back pay to about 1,100 of the 1,500 women employed at the bank's headquarters and 300 of its 500 minority-group members. After the back-pay hearing Mr. Salem said, &quot;we could be conceivably talking about at least 1,400 people&quot; getting back pay.    The December 1977 charges against Harris Trust stemmed from alleged deficiencies in the bank's affirmative-action program. The department said it found problems in various hiring and promotion practices and said it found some women employees were earning less than similarly qualified men. The department's action grew out of a discrimination complaint brought against the bank in 1974 by Women Employed, a Chicago office-worker advocacy group.    The new administrative decision &quot;is a wonderful vindication of what we've been saying all along,&quot; said Nancy Kreiter, research director of Women Employed.    In a statement in Chicago, Harris Trust said, &quot;Too much taxpayer money has been spent trying to prove an allegation that isn't true. This has been a frustrating and costly experience for both sides. . . . We look forward to the end of this administrative process and, if necessary, to pursuing our case in the courts.&quot;    The Labor Department's actions stem from a federal executive order barring most federal contractors from employment discrimination. Currently, Harris acts as a federal depository and as a selling and paying agent for U.S. savings bonds and notes. The hearing officer in the 1981 ruling urged barring the bank from doing federal work until it produced certain confidential employment records. Mr. Litt didn't discuss the issue of barring Harris Trust from government contracts in his decision, the Labor Department's Mr. Salem said.    Besides back pay, Harris Trust may be ordered to give women and minority-member employees additional training and promotions, Labor Department officials noted. </TEXT></DOC>
