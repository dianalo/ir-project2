Reeder, chief of OMB'sInformation Policy Branch, said some members of Congress and agencies areoverly concerned with computer crime and terrorism.andM;Although these threats are real, Reeder said they are &quot;overblown.&quot;andO;Incompetent users and lax security management are much greater dangers todata integrity and systems reliability, he said.andP;  Agencies should concentrateon building security into every system and ensuring that users are trainedproperly, he said.andM;&quot;Security is very sexy only if you're talking about terrorists and hackers,&quot;Reeder said.andP;  &quot;We're ignoring fundamental problems.andP;  There needs to be astrategy for real risk and exposure as a consequence of longstanding qualityassurance.andP;  There's no such thing as absolute security.&quot;andM;Reeder said investments in security are crucial because the government iscontinuing to buy more ADPE.andP;  This fiscal year the government will spendabout $20 billion on technology, with more than $14 billion earmarked formedium and large-scale computers, Reeder said.andM;On a related matter Reeder predicted that within four years there will be onecomputer for every &quot;information or knowledge worker&quot; in government.andP;  Thisinflux of new technology will create new challenges for maintaining privacyand integrity, he said.andM;&quot;There's legitimate reason for increasing concern,&quot; Reeder said.andP;  &quot;There's awhole new class of information processing that permits the profiling andaggregating of information about individuals, and the result is a completelynew way of dealing with privacy.&quot;andM;Some agencies are trying to deal with new security threats by developingstandard contract clauses.andM;Another speaker, Karen Gill Deneroff, chief of the Internal Revenue Service'sInformation Systems Security Section, said IRS established guidelines thatmake security part of every system design.andP;  All IRS solicitations mustinclude access controls, certification and accreditation requirements, andrisk analysis methodologies, she said.andM;&quot;We use baseline requirements so we can take boilerplate out of the documentand all our organizations can use it,&quot; Deneroff said.andP;  &quot;It gets management torecognize security requirements and management takes responsibility forauthorizing the operating system.andP;  It's effective in getting security intoall new systems.&quot;andM;Thomas Boswell, a member of the Education Department's ADP security oversightstaff, said network security will be the next major problem for agencies.andO;Encryption technology can help protect networks, but it is expensive andsmaller agencies probably cannot afford it.andP;  At the very least agencies needto develop stronger access controls for information available on networksbecause there are no absolute safeguards, he said.andM;&quot;There's been an explosion in this technology, and a lot of work is needed,&quot;Boswell said.andP;  &quot;You have to realize there is no guarantee of integritybecause it's easy to intercept information.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
