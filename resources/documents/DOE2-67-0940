This study evaluated the intra- and interlaboratoryvariability of this seven-day test using two reference toxicants (sodiumpentachlorophenate and potassium dichromate), two treated refinery effluents,and one untreated internal utility waste stream. Ten different laboratories,representing academia, private industry, contractors, State EPA and USEPA participated in the study. The reference toxicants were tested twiceduring two separate test periods and each industrial effluent was treatedonce during a single period. Weight NOEC values were generally similarto those for survival, but had substantially greater variability thansurvival NOEC values. Increasing the number of replicate test chambersfrom two to three increased the test sensitivity and decreased the variabilityin NOEC values. Overall this chronic test procedure was moderately easyto carry-out for experienced laboratories and appears to be a precisemethod for estimating toxicity. The laboratories were able to successfullycomplete 126 of 140 tests. Nine of the 14 unsuccessful completed testswere invalid because survival of larvae in control exposures was belowthe US EPA's survival criterion of 80% for chronic bioassays. 26 refs.,13 figs., 40 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
