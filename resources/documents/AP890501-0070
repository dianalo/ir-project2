Jafer Hamayel, 25, an accounting student at Puerto Rico'sInter-American University, was freed Friday, said Donna Sherman, anofficial at the U.S. Consulate in Arab east Jerusalem.   Hamayel disappeared April 13 after being summoned to the Israelimilitary headquarters in the occupied West Bank town of Ramallah.Israeli authorities never confirmed Hamayel's detention to hisfamily, his lawyer or U.S. officials.   He was one of two American citizens in Israeli custody.   The other Palestinian-American, 15-year-old Mansour AbedAl-Samad, pleaded innocent Sunday to charges of stoning an armypatrol in the occupied territories. He has been in custody forthree months.   Sherman said she was unsure why Hamayel was held and said he wasnever informed of any charges. Hamayel's attorney, Jonathan Kuttab,confirmed his client's release and said he also did not know why hewas held.   The Israeli army said they have no record of Hamayel's detentionand thus could not comment on the case.   Hamayel, a native of Kufr Malik north of Jerusalem, obtainedU.S. citizenship several months ago after spending the last sixyears in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where his parents have lived since1966.   Before he left the West Bank in 1983, he spent three months inprison for raising illegal Palestinian flags and scribbling PLOslogans on walls.   On April 4 he returned to renew his Israeli-issued identitycard, without which he would lose his right to live in the WestBank.   He was summoned to military headquarters in nearby Ramallah, anda local man said later he saw Hamayel being held in a tent jail atthe headquarters.</TEXT></DOC>
