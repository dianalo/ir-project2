Conversion would give American the option to withdraw from the Federal Home Loan Bank system and avoid possible costs related to the savings and loan bailout legislation. American, which has $4.6 billion in assets, would continue to be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.    John T. Morgan, chairman, said he was concerned about the impact of the legislation on the capital of the Home Loan Bank system and its continued ability to pay dividends on its stock. American Savings owns about $25 million of Home Loan Bank stock that generates about $2.5 million a year in dividends.    &quot;We think the state system is a more stable one, at least at this time,&quot; he said, &quot;and now we will be regulated by the state and the FDIC.&quot;    American's board approved the conversion plan last month and it will be proposed to holders at a meeting this year. </TEXT></DOC>
