Eastern, a unit of Houston-based Texas Air Corp., already operates a lucrative hourly shuttle service that connects New York to Washington and to Boston.    &quot;The Northeast is where our strength is,&quot; a company spokesman said. &quot;We're completing the triangle.&quot;    The new service differs from the shuttle in several ways. It won't have the backup planes that the shuttle uses to accommodate passenger overflow. The new flights will include advance seat selection and first-class and coach service, which the shuttle doesn't. Shuttle flights depart on the hour; the new service will operate on the half-hour.    Fares on the Boston to Washington route will range from $39 to $99, the spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
