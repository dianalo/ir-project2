Bryant viewsherself as head cheerleader for the team of statisticians,interviewers, geographers and demographers who will conduct nextyear's massive effort to count and categorize the Americanpopulation.   Mrs. Bryant, who took office last week after President Bush useda parliamentary tactic to install her without Senate confirmation,says the groundwork for ``monumental task'' of conducting the 1990census has been laid.   ``What I can do now is be a cheerleader. I am really committedto helping this bureau have a full and accurate count of thepopulation,'' she said, adding that most of the planning, goingback to 1984, has been done by others.   The job has been complicated by the flow of immigrants andillegal aliens into the United States over the past decade. Afterheated debate, Congress voted this year to include illegal aliensand military personnal stationed overseas in the census.   Officials believe 1.6 percent of the population wasn't countedin 1980, including a disproportionately high number of blacks andother racial minorities who often are fearful about taking part inthe census count.   The Census Bureau, in an attempt to target such``hard-to-enumerate'' groups, is trying to overcome their fear andsuspicion by working through local grassroots organizations,especially in urban centers.   ``Some people don't believe the census is really confidential,''said Mrs. Bryant. ``Then there are education and language problemswith some segments of the population ... and other people justdistrust the government.''   She said, ``Every opportunity I have, I'll be getting the wordout. It's confidential. I promise.''   Mrs. Bryant, 63, is the first woman director of the CensusBureau, but she's accustomed to blazing trails. In 1947 she becameone of the first women to gain an editorial rank with a McGraw-HillPublishing Co. magazine.   ``I was never the full-time wife and mother type,'' she said.She married and took an 11-year break to raise three children, butcontinued freelance writing and editing.   She began as a science writer and editor. But while pursuing adoctorate at Michigan State University, ``I got totally hooked oncommunication research'' and later joined Market Opinion Researchof Detroit. In 1977 she became senior vice president of thecompany, whose president until recently was Bush campaign adviserRobert Teeter.   Mrs. Bryant says she does not consider herself to be a politicalappointee and that most of her projects with Market OpinionResearch were non-political. They included studies foruniversities, presidential commissions, government agencies andmedia organizations.   For municipal transit authorities, she developed proposals formaking city bus and subway travel more popular. For NationalGeographic and Harlequin Books, she crafted strategies forincreasing readership.   She conducted polls for Detroit news organizations on issuesranging from casino gambling to putting a dome on Tiger Stadium.   ``I always felt if I were her age I wouldn't have the energy torun all over the country the way she does,'' said James Leiman,another company vice president. ``She's a driven, upbeat, motivatedperson.''   Some critics question the accuracy of polling, but Mrs. Bryantdefends it.   ``You have to watch for people giving socially acceptableanswers,'' she says. ``But the American public is basically prettyhonest.''   For relaxation, Mrs. Bryant swims half a mile a day and dabblesin gardening and cooking. But she'll have little leisure time forthe next year as the census goes forward.   Bush nominated Mrs. Bryant for the census post in September. Butwhen Congress recessed for the year last month, the Senate had yetto take a confirmation vote.   Bush announced Dec. 7 he was giving her a ``recessappointment.'' Under the Constitution, an individual appointed bythe president while the Senate is on an extended recess can serveuntil the end of the following year without Senate confirmation.   Mrs. Bryant says she hopes to be confirmed next year and serveas long as Bush wants her.</TEXT></DOC>
