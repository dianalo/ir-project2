The death toll from more than a week of unrest rose to 16 today,but officials said the nation generally was quiet.   The undersecretary of public security in Buenos Aires province,Lt. Col. Carlos Pombo, described the situation as ``calm andreturning to normal, despite some tension'' in suburbs around thecapital.   Federal and provincial government authorities, aided by privatebusinesses, distributed meat, bread, flour, pasta, powdered milkand other food to the needy in several Buenos Aires suburbs andmajor cities, including Mendoza, Cordoba, La Plata and Tucuman.   In the hard-hit city of Rosario, 190 miles north of BuenosAires, markets that escaped looting during the week opened theirdoors, and long lines quickly formed outside.   In one of the few incidents reported today in Buenos Aires, apolice officer was seriously injured when he was shot in the faceduring a shootout with people trying to loot a butcher's shop inthe suburb of Caseros.   In Tucuman, 820 miles north of the capital, a woman was crushedto death under sugar bags that fell while she and about 50 otherpeople were looting a warehouse.   On Wednesday, police said the owners of a supermarket insuburban Moreno shot and killed three looters, and 9-year-oldRoberto Segovia died in a hospital from injuries suffered inlooting the night before.   Eleven people died Monday and Tuesday.   Scattered looting was reported Wednesday in the industrialsuburbs of the capital and in the provincial capitals of Corrientesand Mendoza. In some Buenos Aires neighborhoods, vandals brieflyblocked streets with burning tires and threw stones at police.   Late Wednesday, however, Interior Minister Juan Carlos Pugliesedeclared, ``Calm reigns throughout the country.''   In Rosario, Argentina's second most populous city and itsmeat-packing center, 3,000 paramilitary police and members of theNational Guard and Coast Guard patrolled city streets to enforcethe peace and protect stores.   The government effort to forestall further violence involvedarresting looters and delivering free food to families hardest hitby Argentina's protracted economic crisis.   The unrest began last week in the interior cities of Mendoza andCordoba after three months of devaluations left the Argentinecurrency, the austral, worth one-tenth of its previous valueagainst the dollar.   On Monday, President Raul Alfonsin declared a state of siege.Inflation meanwhile has raged on, and economists say it is expectedto hit 70 percent for the month of May alone.   According to the conservative Center for a New Majority, realwages are now worth 35 percent of what they were in December 1983,when Alfonsin took office to end a seven-year military dictatorship.   Former President Arturo Frondizi today called for Alfonsin toresign immediately. He was the first prominent politician to demandAlfonsin quit. The 80-year-old Frondizi was elected in 1958 andserved until 1962, when his term of office was cut short by amilitary coup.   Alfonsin met Wednesday with President-elect Carlos Menem, whowon the May 14 election, and observers wondered whether anunpopular lame-duck Alfonsin government can implement anotherausterity program in an attempt to curtail inflation and the budgetdeficit.   Menem indicated to reporters that he didn't want to take officebefore the scheduled Dec. 10 inauguration: ``I don't want tointerfere with the desire of President Alfonsin to serve out hismandate,'' he said.   More than 2,000 people have been arrested over the past ninedays, at least 100 have been shot and wounded, some by rubberbullets, and dozens more have been injured by tear gas, sticks,flying glass and rocks during the riots.   Pugliese claimed a faction of the Everyone for the FatherlandMovement and other leftists incited the riots, though he offered noevidence.   The Everyone for the Fatherland Movement was linked with thebloody assault on an army base Jan. 23 outside Buenos Aires thatleft 27 people dead.</TEXT></DOC>
