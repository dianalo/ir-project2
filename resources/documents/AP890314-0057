Government and rebel troops have clashed at Jalalabad since March6 in the first major test of communist defenses since the Red Armyended its nine-year intervention in Afghanistan one month ago.   Official Radio Kabul and the Soviet news agency Tass said Mondaythat Afghan regime forces had repulsed about 14,000 insurgents and3,000 ``Pakistani advisers'' after a week of heavy fighting.   ``As a result of the heroism and power of the armed forces, (theinsurgents) faced shameful and deadly defeat,'' the radio said in abroadcast monitored in Islamabad.   Communist sources claimed government troops killed more than2,000 of the attackers, but guerrillas put their losses at about 100dead and 400 wounded. Pakistan, which supports the anti-Marxistinsurgents, denies it has any combat troops in neighboringAfghanistan.   The guerrillas, called mujahedeen or ``holy warriors,'' saidMonday they had captured Jalalabad's key garrison at Samarkhel,breached part of the airport perimeter and were holding the oldsection of the city.   They claimed to have captured about 700 regime troops, most ofthem from Samarkhel.   Ghaus Amer of the Afghan News Agency, an organ of hardlineguerrilla leader Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, today described a lull infighting the previous 24 hours as a change of tactics: ``Themujahedeen are now switching to increase the siege of the city toavoid further bloodshed.''   It was not clear whether the insurgents were preparing animmediate second attack.   Correspondents and other eyewitnesses arriving in Pakistan havedescribed intense aerial shelling of mujahedeen positions betweenJalalabad and the border, 33 miles to the east.   They estimated hundreds of insurgents and fleeing civilians werekilled but had no precise figures.   The capture of Jalalabad, a city of about 200,000, would be acrucial moral victory for the guerrillas, who are fighting toestablish an Islamic republic of Afghanistan.   The fight for the capital of Nangarhar province has sentthousands of Afghans fleeing over the border to Pakistan and filledhospitals in this country with hundreds of wounded.   The United States, Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia are the mainmilitary backers of the mujahedeen.   Pakistan already shelters more than 3 million refugees of thedecade-long war and Iran hosts about 2 million.   Hekmatyar, foreign minister in an interim government establishedby Pakistan-based guerrillas, said Monday that the insurgents arecapable at any time of taking Jalalabad and the rest of Afghanistan.   Hekmatyar, who was in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Monday for ameeting of the Organization of Islamic Conference, said Najib'sgovernment ``will fall within weeks.''   ``We are perfectly capable of overrunning Kabul and Jalalabad andother regions, but we prefer to delay military action in inhabitedregions. We do not want to spill blood any more.''   He said a qualified organization would be selected to estimatethe amount of Afghanistan's losses as a result of the Sovietmilitary intervention and how much ``Moscow should pay us inreparations.''</TEXT></DOC>
