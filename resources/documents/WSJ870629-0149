Over the past few years, the FCC has largely deregulated children's programming, arguing that the marketplace protects children from commercial exploitation. But a three-judge panel of the U.S. appeals court here ordered the agency to reconsider its 1984 decision eliminating guidelines on the number of advertisements aired on children's shows.    &quot;Without explanation, the commission has suddenly embraced what had theretofore been an unthinkable bureaucratic conclusion that the market did in fact operate to restrain the commercial content of children's television,&quot; wrote Judge Kenneth Starr for the unanimous panel.    Before eliminating its advertising guidelines, the FCC effectively limited the number of advertisement on children's shows to 9 1/2 minutes each hour on Saturday and Sunday, and 12 minutes an hour on other days. Strictly speaking, the guidelines weren't mandatory, but if a station violated them it became subject to an FCC review. This prospect made stations follow them.    Judge Starr said the agency changed its policy without providing an adequate rationale.    Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's Television, the Cambridge, Mass., advocacy group that brought the lawsuit, called the decision &quot;the best thing that has happened to children's television in years.&quot; She added: &quot;The message is that children aren't fair game for what (advertisers) throw at them.&quot;    Henry Geller, a former FCC general counsel who represented Action for Children's Television, said the federal agency would be hard-pressed to provide a plausible explanation for its change in policy. If more than about 5% of television stations violate the old advertising guidelines, he contended, that would demonstrate &quot;significant commercialization,&quot; which would warrant reimposing the guidelines.    But Valerie Schulte, senior associate general counsel at the National Association of Broadcasters, said the court only wanted the FCC to explain its policy better, not re-regulate. &quot;The court doesn't want blood; it wants a fuller explanation,&quot; she said.    Diane Killory, the FCC's general counsel, said the court's decision was limited to a &quot;procedural defect.&quot; If the FCC wants to keep its deregulation policy, she said, it must provide a fuller explanation. But after providing such an explanation, she said, it would be difficult to overturn the decision in court because the appeals court traditionally accords the FCC wide latitude in setting policy. </TEXT></DOC>
