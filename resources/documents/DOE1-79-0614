From the measured interaction cross sections, radii ofunstable nuclei were deduced for light p-shell nuclei. The isospin dependenceas well as the isotope dependence of the nuclear radii are discussed.The projectile fragmentation of exotic nuclei, /sup 11/Li, have recentlybeen observed. The existence of neutron halo in /sup 11/Li nuclei issuggested from the data. The possibility of studying the space and themomentum distributions of nucleons in exotic nuclei are also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
