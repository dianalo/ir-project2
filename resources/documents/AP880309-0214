The big Iowa winners were big Super Tuesday losers, while two ofthe biggest Iowa losers _ Vice President George Bush and Sen.Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee _ were riding high.   Gore had denounced the Iowa caucuses as ``sort of like aroulette game _ it's not democracy in action.''   Iowa caucus-goers responded in kind, giving the Tennesseesenator less than 1 percent of their votes. They gave more supportto Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, who was insisting he was not acandidate.   Iowans weren't much kinder to Bush. He finished third in theRepublican caucuses, not only far behind Dole, but trailing anembarrassing distance behind former television evangelist PatRobertson.   Exactly a month later, Super Tuesday weighed in and Bush beatDole and Robertson in 16 out of 16 Republican primaries. On theDemocratic side, Gephardt carried only his home state of Missouri,while Gore carried six states. Paul Simon, the other Democrattreated well by Iowans, was waiting for one last shot at survivalin his home state of Illinois.   So, the question arises, is this it for Iowa?   ``Al Gore may have demolished the theory that you've got to runin Iowa and New Hampshire,'' said White House Chief of Staff HowardH. Baker Jr. ``He is a very credible candidate and he did not makea major effort in Iowa and New Hampshire.''   ``It looks like the allure of the land of corn wears off by thetime you get to the hominy grits,'' said John Buckley, presssecretary to Rep. Jack Kemp, who failed to excite Iowa voters _ orthose anywhere else.   But Iowa still has its defenders.   Phil Roeder, spokesman for the Iowa Democratic Party, said theSuper Tuesday results simply ``addressed one of the biggestcriticisms a lot of people had of Iowa, that it had too muchinfluence.''   ``We learned last night that Iowa certainly is not the beginningand the end of the campaign, it's just the beginning and a lot canchange once things get rolling,'' said Roeder.   Nelson Polesby, a professor of political science at theUniversity of California at Berkeley and an expert on thenominating process, was another dissenter from the theory thatIowa's importance was diminished by the Super Tuesday vote.   ``It seems to me they (Iowa and New Hampshire) framed thealternatives for Super Tuesday quite successfully,'' said Polesby.``I think what it demonstrates is that front-loading is terriblyimportant, having money ahead of time is terribly important.''   Polesby said one might as well write off Super Tuesday sincethat Southern-generated event did not produce the desired result ofa conservative front-runner.   As well as Gore did on his home ground, the strong dose ofSouthern events proved just as beneficial to two liberals _Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson.   David Keene, who was a Dole political adviser until he had afalling out with campaign chairman William Brock, said having asmall state or two at the start of the process is a good thing.   ``Guys without as much money who are not as well known can testand break through against a front-runner,'' he said. ``It gives youa ticket to the game. It doesn't necessarily and shouldn'tnecessarily mean you're going to win the game.''</TEXT></DOC>
