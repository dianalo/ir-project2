New technologies are fully discussed along with methodsfor measuring human somatic mutations as tools for evaluating the risksof heritable mutations. Provides background information on genetics andDNA, and reviews types of mutations that can occur, and their potentialhealth effects. Emphasis is on new technologies and tests.</TEXT></DOC>
