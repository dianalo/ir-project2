JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Preliminary tests suggest unhealthy levels ofradon in schools across the country, the Environmental ProtectionAgency said Thursday in urging every school to test for theodorless, cancer-causing gas.   ``Based on measurements taken in 3,000 schoolrooms in 16 states,it appears that elevated levels of radon gas can be found inschools throughout the United States,'' EPA Administrator WilliamK. Reilly told a luncheon at the National Press Club.   The EPA said that 54 percent of 130 public schools tested in 41communities had at least one room in which radon levels were foundto exceed 4 picocuries per liter of air, indicating a need foradditional tests and, likely, corrective action.   In 101 rooms tested at schools in five states, levels of atleast 20 picocuries per liter were found, comparable to what wouldbe found in uranium mines.   EPA spokeswoman Martha Casey said no list of the schools testedwas immediately available, but affected state authorities andschool officials have been told of the test results.   Reilly called indoor radon, the result of natural radioactivedecay in the ground, ``one of the major environmental healththreats facing Americans'' and urged that school officialsnationwide test their schoolrooms for the gas.   He said it is ``important that school administrators nationwideunderstand both the seriousness of the risk and the relativesimplicity of testing and fixing the problem.''   There is no federal law requiring tests for the radioactive gas,although the EPA by law is required to conduct sample testsnationwide in homes and schools to determine potential healththreats. The preliminary findings from the 16 states came fromtwo-day tests in rooms normally occupied by students, teachers andschool staff, Ms. Casey said.   Last September, the EPA urged all homeowners to conduct radontests after unhealthy levels _ 4 picocuries per liter of air _ ofradon were found in one out of four homes tested in 17 states.   The agency has said that exposure over a lifetime at that levelis equivalent to smoking 10 cigarettes a day. The EPA said studieshave indicated indoor exposure to radon may cause up to 20,000 lungcancer deaths a year, which would make such deaths second only tothose caused by smoking.   The latest EPA tests, although preliminary, indicate thatunhealthy radon levels in schools are at least as widespread as inresidences, although the agency emphasized that the levels mayrange widely from school to school and even among rooms in the sameschool.   Guimond estimated in an interview that from the data obtained inthe limited number of tests it is estimated that students inprobably 10 percent of the nation's schools are exposed tolong-term radon levels that exceed the 4 picocuries standard.   The EPA said that of the 3,000 schoolrooms tested, 19 percenthad levels of 4 picocuries or more and 3 percent had levels of atleast 20 picocuries.   The agency gave this breakdown of states with schoolrooms havingradon levels of at least 20 picocuries: Tennessee, 77 rooms;Washington, 14; New Mexico, 7; Maine, 2, and Montana, 1.   The highest level was found in a schoolroom in Tennessee inwhich 136 picocuries per liter of air were detected. Schools withunusually high levels _ ranging from 25 to 98 picocuries per literof air in a single schoolroom _ were Washington (98 picocuries),Montana (51), New Mexico (41) and Maine (25).   Richard Guimond, the EPA's director of radiation programs, saidsuch levels ``are not that unique'' at schools located in areaswhere significant radon is present in the ground and whereventilation systems often suck radon into buildings. ``When thesetwo things occur, you're going to get those high levels,'' he said.   Federal standards call for uranium miners to wear specialbreathing equipment when working long periods in radon levels of 16to 20 picocuries, said Guimond.   The other states in which schools were tested were were Nevada,Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri,Illinois, Indiana, Georgia and New Jersey.   The agency said exposure levels are difficult to determine fromthe test data because students in many schools move from room toroom during the day and because radon levels may vary widely amongthe rooms in a school.   According to the agency, unhealthy radon levels also have beenfound in EPA tests in schools in Virginia, Florida, Maryland,Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, and Iowa. Those findings were notpart of the latest study and no additional information wasavailable.   Radon is a naturally produced gas that is colorless, odorlessand tasteless. It is the product of the natural radioactive decayof Radium-226 in the soil and rocks. While levels normally foundoutdoors _ 0.2 to 0.7 picocurie per liter _ post no known dangers,accumulated concentrations can be much higher indoors.   Scientists have said that the health risks of radon depend notonly on the concentration of radon at a given time, but also on thelength of exposure. Estimated health risks normally are based onexposure over a lifetime.   The EPA estimates that as many as 15 percent of lung cancerdeaths annually may be related to radon exposure. While smokingremains clearly the major cause of lung cancer, a combination ofheavy smoking and lifelong exposure to high levels of radon sharplyincreases the chances of lung cancer, according to studies by theNational Acacemy of Sciences.   The EPA said radon tests were conducted in public schools inthese communities:   Maine _ Gorham, Biddeford, Sanford. New Jersey _ Randolph, LongValley. Tennessee _ Nashville (metropolitan area). Georgia _Decatur, Lilburn. Illinois _ Peoria. Indiana _ Michigan City, LaPorte, Rolling, Claypool, Warsaw, Milford.   Minnesota _ Buffalo, Burnsville, Rosemont, Shakopee, Scandia,New Prague, Carver, Chaska, St. Paul, Little Canada, Red Wing,Minneapolis Minnetonka, Cleveland.   New Mexico _ Los Alamos. Kansas _ Overland Park. Missouri _Kansas City, Independence. Wyoming _ Wright, Gillette, Dubois.Montana _ Butte. North Dakota _ Bismarck. Colorado _ Denver(metropolitan area).   Nevada _ Las Vegas (metropolitan area). Washington _ Spokane(metropolitan area).</TEXT></DOC>
