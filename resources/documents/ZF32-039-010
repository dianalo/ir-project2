Tuesday said it is confident it will win itscopyright infringement suit filed against Borland International in July 1990,charging the company with deliberately copying the menu commands and menustructure of Lotus 1-2-3.andM;Lotus said that by filing a &quot;cross motion&quot;  for summary judgment yesterday,Borland concurred with Lotus' position that Judge Robert E. Keeton can reacha decision on the crucial issue of the copyrightability of the menus of Lotus1-2-3 without a lengthy or expensive trial.andM;&quot;In filing for summary judgment last May, we informed the court that we didnot think there were any remaining issues of fact that needed to be decidedto determine that Borland is infringing our copyrights, and therefore no needfor a trial,&quot;  said Thomas Lemberg, Lotus' vice president and generalcounsel.andP;  &quot;After spending more than 100 days preparing its response, Borlandcame up with no arguments not already rejected in the Paperback case and,moreover, agreed with Lotus that copyrightability should be decided bysummary judgment.andM;&quot;Borland also has trumpeted a 'Friend of the Court' brief issued by the U.S.andO;Copyright Office and the Justice Department.andP;  Borland misled people earliertoday by claiming that the Copyright Office used Lotus 1-2-3 as an example ofmenu commands that are not copyrightable.andP;  This is not the case,&quot;  Lembergadded.andP;  &quot;The purpose of the brief is to inform the court of the registrationprocedures of the Copyright Office -- not to comment on the copyrightabilityof the menu commands and structure of Lotus 1-2-3.andM;&quot;The Copyright Office specifically said, 'In submitting this brief, theRegister is not advocating a particular result to be reached, but merelypointing out the approach taken by the Copyright Office in this area.andO;Accordingly, this brief should not be taken as commenting on thecopyrightability or scope of protection to be accorded the works at issue inthis case, i.e., those relating to Lotus 1-2-3.'andM;&quot;In fact, the brief does not say that the menu commands or structure of Lotus1-2-3 (or any other software program) are not copyrightable.andP;  Indeed, theCopyright Office has recognized that menus are 'integral parts of computerprograms' and may well contain copyrightable expressions.andP;  Ultimately, as thebrief recognized, the decision on copyrightability is for the court to make-- and in Lotus vs.andP;  Paperback this court already decided that the menus inLotus 1-2-3 are copyrightable.&quot;andM;SEE NEXT STORY</TEXT></DOC>
