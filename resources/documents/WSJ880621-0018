Economists also say several foreign central banks may be tightening credit soon. West Germany is expected to nudge short-term rates higher today, and some analysts say Japan and Britain also could raise rates.    In the U.S. bond market, prices of long-term Treasury issues slumped early in yesterday's session but rebounded in the afternoon to wind up about unchanged from Friday's levels. Municipal, corporate and mortgage-backed bonds also finished little changed.    In Washington, the Fed has indicated it is making no significant changes in policy. But an increase in the federal funds rate recently is said to suggest the Fed is willing to err slightly on the side of a tighter policy.    Federal Reserve actions in the money markets yesterday and late last week apparently convinced some analysts that the central bank is trying to push the federal funds rate up to about 7 1/2%. Earlier in the month, the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight was averaging around 7 3/8%.    Maria Fiorini Ramirez, a managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said the rate is likely to remain around 7 1/2%. She said a series of tightening moves can be expected in view of &quot;strong world-wide economic growth.&quot;    Anticipating the West German rate move, Michael D. Andrews, a vice president and international economist at Irving Trust Co., said, &quot;Although inflation is low in Germany, it's been creeping steadily higher, and German authorities are fearful the weaker mark will accentuate the rising trend in prices.&quot;    He said West Germany's money supply is growing considerably faster than its targeted growth range, its economy is stronger than expected, and the mark has been weak lately.    Japanese economic growth, meanwhile, also has been much stronger than expected, while Japan's money supply has expanded rapidly. &quot;If they paid attention to economic activity in just Japan, the Bank of Japan would have tightened by now,&quot; said Susumu Saito, Tokyo-based chief economist for Credit Suisse Investment Advisory Co. Ltd., a unit of Credit Suisse. But he said concern about the yen-dollar exchange rate and the impact that a rate increase would have on U.S. financial markets has held Japan back.    &quot;The Bank of Japan would like to raise the discount rate or at least tighten gradually but can't fully predict the effect on stock and bond markets, especially before the (U.S.) election&quot; in November, Mr. Saito said.    He said the Fed should have tightened monetary policy even more than it has, considering the recent rises in commodity prices.    &quot;There is a tug of war between the Fed and the Bank of Japan,&quot; he said. &quot;Neither side wants to get the blame&quot; for any dislocations in world financial markets.    Japanese inflation is still very low, but the country's monetary authorities are apprehensive about a buildup of inflationary pressures. &quot;The longer they wait for monetary correction, the larger the correction will be,&quot; Mr. Saito said.    For the first time in months, foreign central banks believe they have some room to raise rates, said Nicholas P. Sargen, an international economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. But he said that whatever central banks do, they will do cautiously, not wishing to repeat the turmoil of last fall, when rising rates helped touch off the world-wide stock market crash.    Still, Mr. Sargen said, a Bundesbank rate increase probably would be followed by a move by the Bank of England to prevent the pound from weakening further against the mark and to dampen inflationary expectations.    Foreign Bonds   The West German central bank is expected to act today to tighten credit. But analysts disagreed on how large a move it will have to make.    West German government bond prices fell 1/8 to 3/4 of a point in sluggish trading yesterday, and most Euromark issues dropped 1/4 to 1/2.    The government's 6 1/2% issue due 1998 ended the day at 98.90 to yield 6.653%. That was down 0.15 from last week's close but up from the day's low of 98.55 in interbank dealing. Medium-term government bonds took a worse beating, with prices on some eight-year issues falling as much as 3/4.    The Bundesbank is expected to act today to increase the one-month repurchase agreement rate to 3 1/2% from 3 1/4%, where it has been since last November. Several traders cited this as a factor contributing to weaker securities prices yesterday. But some also said a quarter-point increase won't be enough to defuse inflationary pressures and said the central bank will have to take additional steps soon.    In Tokyo, Japanese government bond prices declined again in light trading, closing near their lows.    Many investors remained on the sidelines to await the end of the Toronto summit of major industrial powers.    The government's benchmark 5% No. 105 issue due 1997 ended at a yield of 4.78% in the interdealer market, up 4.5 basis points on the day. The closing yield represented a price of 101.43 yen, down 0.30.    In London, inflation concerns continued to undermine the gilt, or government securities, market as prices fell by as much as 7/16 in fairly quiet trading.    The release of data showing a lower-than-expected increase in bank lending helped the market, and most issues ended above their lows for the day. At the same time, a strong performance by the British pound in the currency markets reduced the chance of base rates being raised in the near future.    The price decline pushed long gilts' yields close to the recent support level of 9.50%. Market sources said this encouraged a little institutional buying, but most analysts and traders still expect yields to continue rising to compensate for the rise in inflationary fears.    &quot;Every time (yields) test 9.50%, the support gets weaker and weaker. People are now looking for 9.70% to 9.75%,&quot; said John Shepperd, gilt analyst at Warburg Securities.    After falling as far as 117 12/32, the benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007 ended 8/32 lower at 117 20/32 to yield 9.49%. Among shorter-term gilts, the Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 1991 fell 10/32 at 105 4/32 to yield 9.43%, while the Treasury 12% issue due 1995 declined 12/32 to 111 12/32 to yield 9.63%.    Treasury Securities   Traders said yesterday afternoon's bond rally was fueled partly by news reports that a tax package to be proposed by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) won't include a 5% withholding tax on portfolio interest paid to foreigners.    Late Friday, talk of such a proposal fueled speculation that foreign investors would shun U.S. Treasuries.    Also helping to bolster prices were news reports that Congress probably won't act soon to increase the government's authority to sell new 30-year bonds. That led to more speculation that the Treasury won't be able to auction its usual amount of 30-year bonds in its August financing operation.    The Treasury's 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 were quoted late in the day at 100 10/32, up slightly from 100 8/32 Friday. The yield slipped to 9.09% from 9.10%. At one stage early yesterday, the issue traded at 99 5/8.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 0.14 to 1230.07. The low was 1222.07, and the high was 1230.38.    The government's 9% notes due 1998 fell slightly to 99 28/32 from 99 30/32 Friday. The yield rose to 9.02% from 9.01%.    Speculation that the Federal Reserve is tightening credit grew yesterday after the central bank arranged $2.5 billion of repurchase agreements on behalf of a customer, which usually means a foreign central bank. At the time, the rate on federal funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, stood at 7 5/8%.    Some analysts said the Fed move wasn't an aggressive one and thus represented another signal that the central bank is comfortable with a funds rate of around 7 1/2%. The funds rate yesterday averaged 7.63%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc., compared with 7.54% Friday.    Rates also rose on short-term Treasury bills sold yesterday by the government at its regular weekly auction. The Treasury sold new three-month bills at an average rate of 6.51%, compared with 6.44% a week earlier. The average rate on new 26-week bills rose to 6.83% from 6.67%.    Here are details:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                13-Week         26-Week Applications ........... $23,455,975,000   $21,561,700,000 Accepted bids ........... $6,408,195,000    $6,403,020,000 Accepted at low price .............. 57%               62% Accepted noncompet'ly ..... $601,395,000      $676,720,000 Average price (Rate) ..... 98.354(6.51%)     96.547(6.83%) High price (Rate) ........ 98.362(6.48%)     96.567(6.79%) Low price (Rate) ......... 98.352(6.52%)     96.542(6.84%) Coupon equivalent ................ 6.71%             7.17%   Both issues are dated June 23. The 13-week bills mature Sept. 22, and the 26-week bills mature Dec. 22.   Municipals   Actively traded municipal bonds were little changed in sluggish trading after suffering sharp losses late last week.   A few other municipal issues showed spotty losses or gains of as much as 1/4 point.   The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds of 2018 finished unchanged at 89 5/8 to yield 8.12%.   Meanwhile, traders are awaiting today's offering by Washington state of $212.5 million of various purpose general obligation bonds due 1989-2013.   Separately, New York's Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority confirmed that it plans to sell $115 million of bonds in the near future. An official said the agency has decided to use a shelf financing for the first time. The agency will give underwriters 48 hours' notice of when it will accept bids for the issue.   The official also said the authority is meeting with major rating agencies about a new type of issue to be secured by mortgage recording tax revenue from the municipalities that the Triborough authority serves. He said the first issue could come to market as early as next month and could total about $225 million. He said the authority expects to issue about $500 million of this type of bond.   Mortgage-Backed Securities   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage-backed securities finished little changed in light trading.   The bond market slump that began late last week led Freddie Mac yesterday to raise the coupon rate on the 30-year mortgage securities it auctions daily to 10% from 9.5%. Freddie Mac cut the coupon rate to 9.5% from 10% last Tuesday, reflecting strength in bond prices that day.   The rising rates of the past several sessions probably will result in higher costs for home buyers seeking fixed-rate conventional mortgages. Freddie Mac yesterday offered to pay 10.31% for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages for delivery in 30 days, compared with 9.97% last Tuesday.   The increase in Freddie Mac's posted yield means that mortgage originators face pressure to move up the rate on 30-year conventional mortgages to more than 10.50%.   Among Ginnie Maes, the July 9% issue was quoted late yesterday at 93 5/8 bid, down 2/32, to yield 10.08% for a 12-year average life assumption.   Corporate Issues   Corporate bond prices finished little changed in light trading.   An issue was added to the week's calendar, as Continental Corp. is expected to offer $300 million of five-year non-callable notes.   The issue is expected to be priced at 0.70 to 0.75 of a percentage point above the rate on five-year Treasury notes. Those notes were quoted late yesterday at a yield of about 8.59%. Salomon Brothers Inc. is lead underwriter.   Proceeds will be used to refinance short-term loans that the company floated under a stock repurchase program after the Oct. 19 stock market crash. Some proceeds may also be used for additional stock purchases.</TEXT></DOC>
