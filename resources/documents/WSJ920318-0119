He spends many weekends and part of hisvacation hunting or fishing near his lakeside cabin innorthern Michigan. He earns about $36,000 a year at his jobcleaning out the paint stalls in General Motors Corp.'sWillow Run assembly plant.   Halfway across the world, Satoru Seo turns out axles inToyota Motor Corp.'s Motomachi plant in Toyota City, earninga salary that with the current strong yen translates to$75,000 a year. He and his wife own one home, a996-square-foot two-story house with a tiny kitchen and apostage-stamp garden, situated just a few kilometers from thefactory. Like most people they know, they live in a housewith no central heating, even though snow isn't uncommon. Thefamily's most memorable vacation was a two-night stay atcompany lodgings in the foothills of Mount Fuji about threeyears ago. Unfortunately, it was too cold to use the swimmingpool or tennis courts.</LP><TEXT>   With all the controversy swirling lately over the Americanwork ethic, the circumstances of Detroit's Mr. Dankert andToyota City's Mr. Seo illustrate a simple fact: The standardof living for many U.S. factory workers remains far higher.Mr. Seo may have greater job security and peace of mind -- GMcould announce as early as today whether it will close Mr.Dankert's plant -- but by almost every other measure, Mr.Dankert's quality of life is superior, and would stay so fora time even if he should be laid off.   While no two workers' backgrounds are precisely the same,Messrs. Dankert and Seo are roughly comparable in age,seniority and work habits. The one difference is that Mr. Seohas risen to group leader, supervising a crew of seven, whileMr. Dankert remains a laborer.   On a recent cold winter day, Mr. Dankert and his wife,Sandra, sit in the living room of their $140,000 housewatching sports on television. The 40-year-old Mr. Dankertseems unfazed by the prospect that his plant might soon closeand his job be lost. &quot;We have been hearing the plant will godown for four years. We have no control over it,&quot; he says.&quot;If it does, it does.&quot;   If so, Mr. Dankert says he is willing to move anywhere inthe country where GM has an opening. He and his wife havealready decided that she will stay in Michigan if he has tomove. They both have family in Michigan and she earns about$25,000 a year, including overtime, as a supervisor in aplant that manufactures medicine bottles. Indeed, one reasonthe Dankerts live so well is that Mrs. Dankert works. Mrs.Seo doesn't. Although more Japanese wives are taking jobsthese days, few with young children work full time.   Thanks to GM's contract with the United Auto Workers, Mr.Dankert will receive nearly his full salary until September1993, whether or not he works. But, he says, &quot;I'm notinterested in milking them. I prefer to work.&quot;   What Mr. Dankert takes in stride would cause intenseanxiety in Japan. Over lunch in the Toyota plant's bright newcafeteria, a member of Mr. Seo's work group recounts withastonishment a segment from a recent Japanese evening newsshow: A manager at a U.S. auto company had lost his job,prompting his wife to go to work. The U.S. manager's plight&quot;is unthinkable for us,&quot; says the 41-year-old Japaneseworker, Kaoru Yoshida.   The only time in its 55-year history that Toyota has laidoff workers was in 1950, when postwar economic disruptionsbrought the company to the verge of bankruptcy. WhileToyota's profits have dropped sharply during the recentglobal slowdown in the auto industry, the only effect onemployment has been reduced overtime, something the in-houseunion, the company and the government have all been urginganyway. In addition, bonuses, which make up about a third oftotal pay for Toyota workers, are likely to dip slightly.   Mr. Seo's work schedule alternates from week to week. Oneweek he begins at 8 a.m. and finishes after dusk; the next,he works from 8:30 p.m. to dawn. It is a routine the42-year-old has followed for the past 24 years.   These days, he puts in 25 to 30 hours of overtime in atypical month. According to his boss, Mr. Seo is a hardworker, but his greatest value as a group leader is hisability to build team spirit.   But apart from a traditional commitment to hard work,structural factors play a role in Japanese work habits. If aToyota worker takes time off because he's sick, he doesn'tget paid for the first three days. From the fourth day, hegets 80% of his pay. This encourages a worker to either showup for work despite feeling ill or use up paid holidays untilhe feels better. Workers do get full pay immediately if theymiss work because of a work-related injury. But someemployees of Toyota and other Japanese auto companiescomplain that institutional and cultural pressures cause manyworkers to keep plugging away despite nonvisible injuries,such as back pain or wrist ailments.   Mrs. Seo says she can't remember her husband's ever havingtaken a day off because of sickness. He has never beenseriously ill and doesn't let a run-of-the-mill cold keep himhome.   Mr. Dankert also works hard, fellow workers say. &quot;He's thekind of worker foremen want to work for them,&quot; says BobHarlow, president of the plant's union local. Like Mr. Seo,Mr. Dankert goes to work when he has a cold. He almost nevertakes his full four weeks of vacation.   He has had sore wrists (diagnosed as carpal tunnelsyndrome) almost since he started working at GM in 1969.There are days &quot;when it hurts me to pump gas in my car,&quot; hesays. Although GM provides five days of paid sick leave ayear, he has taken only about four weeks off work because ofthe wrist condition during his years at GM.   For both families, work in the auto industry has meantbetter lives. The Dankerts and the Seos all come from modestbackgrounds. Mr. Dankert's father was a GM worker who died ofa heart attack at age 43. Mr. Dankert remembers getting onepair of shoes a year as a boy and using cardboard to coverholes in the sole until the next pair arrived. Mrs. Dankertgrew up a coal miner's daughter in a tiny town in westernVirginia. Her family never went hungry, but she didn't eather first restaurant meal until she was a teen-ager.   Mr. Seo's father operated a stall in a food market andlater worked for a wholesaler in a fish market in Nagoya,about an hour's drive from Toyota City. Working in the fishmarket meant rising as early as 1 a.m. to handle the day'swares.   The Dankerts still practice thrift. He saves $200 a weekout of his $737 a week salary, while she saves about $100 aweek. They're trying to pay off his house loan early bysending an extra $100 with each monthly payment. They paidcash for their last car, and have no debt on the cabin. Their22-year-old daughter is married and has moved out of thehouse, and their 16-year-old son will probably go to tradeschool, which is much less costly than college.   The Dankerts say they try to buy American-made productswhenever possible. He drives a 1979 Chevrolet pickup and shea 1989 Chevrolet Cavalier. They also own a 1987 OldsmobileCutlass 442. A few of Mr. Dankert's fellow auto workers driveJapanese cars to work, something that baffles the Dankerts.&quot;I think people are going to wake up too late,&quot; Mrs. Dankertlaments, &quot;and find they've lost their country.&quot;   Much of what the Seos have has come from Toyota, anddriving anything but a Toyota car would be unthinkable. Alow-rate company mortgage helped the Seos buy their two-storyhome in 1980 for 20 million yen (now $157,000). When Mr. Seotrades in his 10-year-old Toyota Mark II later this year,he'll buy another with a 20% employee discount andlow-interest loan.   At home, Yuriko Seo serves visitors tea, crackers andfresh strawberries, then withdraws to the kitchen until thetalk turns to the household budget. Like most Japanesehousewives, Mrs. Seo controls the purse strings. She spendsabout $790 a month on groceries. About $160 a month of Mr.Seo's salary goes straight into a company savings plan. And$1,600 from each of his twice-annual bonus payments goes intothe nest egg, with some of the rest used to pay down the25-year mortgage.   Like most Japanese children, the Seos' nine-year-old and12-year-old sons supplement their regular schooling withafterhours lessons at private schools two or three days aweek, including Saturdays. But Mr. and Mrs. Seo try not topush too hard. &quot;I want them to learn how to get along insocial groups rather than just getting good grades,&quot; says Mr.Seo.   On Sundays, the boys, along with their six-year-oldbrother, are required to do housework with their parents. Thefamily lunches at McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken or asushi shop, and spends the afternoon at a park or at Toyota'ssprawling sports center in the city's northern hills.   Neither Mr. Dankert nor Mr. Seo seems to feel much of therancor that has surfaced in the recent debate over Japanesetrade practices and American work habits. Mr. Dankertbelieves GM is partly to blame for its loss in market share.The company was hurt by quality problems and look-alikemodels during the 1980s, he says. But the quality of GM carshas now improved to where they are &quot;comparable to Japanesecars,&quot; he says.   Nor does he blame Japanese companies for taking awaymarket share. &quot;You can't be bitter,&quot; he says. &quot;GM, Ford andChrysler had their chance to keep it.&quot;   And Mr. Seo says he understands U.S. anger at recentcriticisms by Japanese politicians. &quot;We've had some terriblethings said about us,&quot; he says. &quot;Our tendency is to bow ourheads when someone bashes us. But deep down, anyone gets mad&quot;when insulted.   Mr. Seo says the lingering caricature of Japanese workersas &quot;economic animals&quot; grates on him. He proudly points outlifestyle changes at Toyota: Fashionably appointeddormitories are starting to replace the barracks-stylehousing Mr. Seo once lived in; there are modern apartmentunits for married couples temporarily priced out of the homemarket by 1980s land inflation; and tavern tables in nooksalong the assembly lines are available during workers'10-minute breaks.   Mr. Seo took his allotted 20 vacation days last year --something he didn't do until the past three years -- andspent part of his time off in the mountains with his family.Yet he's still not fully comfortable with the notion ofleisure. &quot;We need to strive to find ways to have more spacein our lives,&quot; he says, but &quot;to change too suddenly can makepeople disoriented.&quot;   Despite the advantages the American couple enjoys, thereis one glaring difference: their confidence in the future.Mr. Seo not only feels sure of continued employment but alsoexpects his working conditions to continue to improve. Thingslook much less certain to the Dankerts. &quot;I worry aboutAmerica in general,&quot; says Mrs. Dankert as she finishes a mealof take-out pizza with sausage and pepperoni. &quot;Bob and I canmake it. We might not have this home, we might not have threecars, but we can make it.&quot; Mr. Dankert adds, &quot;I worry for thekids, because there's nothing out there for them.&quot;   (See related letter: &quot;Letters to the Editor:&quot;Double-Income Yank Invalidates Comparison&quot; -- WSJ March 18,1992)   920224-0119</TEXT></DOC>
