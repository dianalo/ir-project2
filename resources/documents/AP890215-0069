(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Red Army commander for Afghanistantoday led the last contingent of his troops across a border bridge,ending for the Soviets a nine-year war that claimed the lives of15,000 of their countrymen.   ``That is it _ this war has come to an end,'' a Moscow Radiocorrespondent said from the scene.   About 200 cheering, windburned soldiers, clutching automaticrifles and riding mud-spattered armored personnel carriers, roaredacross the steel bridge spanning the Amu Darya River just 40 minutesbefore the noon withdrawal deadline set by an accord signed in April.   ``I wasn't looking back,'' said Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov, thecommander, after the Red Army officially left Afghanistan's armyalone to face Moslem guerrillas in a 10-year-old civil war.   He rode in the last armored personnel carrier and was met halfwayacross the bridge by his 14-year-old son, Maxim, who carried abouquet of flowers.   Together, they walked the final yards to Termez.   The 45-year-old general, at times appearing near tears, waskissed by a soldier, then climbed atop an armored personnel carrierto be taken to a dusty hillside for the official welcoming ceremony.   Some at the ceremony said getting involved in a neighbor's civilwar was a mistake.   ``It was a clear error, so many died,'' said senior Sgt. AsgatHusayinov, 22. He said Afghanistan was ``a hell after which you fearnothing, except maybe yourself.'' The soldiers at the ceremonyreceived watches sent on the orders of Defense Minister Dmitri T.Yazov.   Lt. Col. Igor Azarenok of the Defense Ministry said Gromov'sgroup was the last to leave, ending what many Soviets have come toview as their Vietnam.   In Moscow, the Communist Party daily Pravda said LeonidBrezhnev's decision in 1979 to send troops to Afghanistan may havebeen an error. It suggested future commitments of Soviet forcesabroad should be sanctioned by Parliament.   It called the withdrawal ``the first step'' toward peace inAfghanistan.   With Gromov and his troops gone, guerrilla leaders have predictedthat major cities held by the Soviet-backed government will fall ina matter of weeks, if not days.   Soviet media have reported looting by troops of the 30,000-memberAfghan army _ and mass desertions as the U.S.-supplied guerrillasgain ground.   Soviet officials estimate 30,000 guerrillas are massed around thecold, hungry capital of Kabul, which has been blockaded for months.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said another 15,000guerrillas were around the eastern city of Jalalabad. Kabul Radio,monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp., reported moreinsurgents surrounding Herat and Khandahar.   Guerrillas claimed there was heavy fighting around a formerSoviet airbase north of Kabul.   Along the muddy, narrow streets of Kabul's bazaar, merchantshuddling under thick quilts seemed more interested in bartering fortheir goods than discussing the Soviet withdrawal.   ``The Russians are gone,'' said one, trying to sell Soviet furhats. ``Now there will be peace.''   There was no announcement on national radio or television aboutthe final departure. Only those with access to BBC radio heard thenews.   The decision to intervene in Afghanistan was made by the latePresident Brezhnev and a few close associates, high-rankingofficials have said. Pravda said the security threat perceived bythem may not have merited sending in troops.   ``It is possible to doubt the Brezhnev leadership's evaluation ofthe level of military ttest pain and worry forour people. Scientists, politicians, soldiers and all other peoplewill be thinking and debating for a long time whether the decisionof the government of the country taken at that time was right.''   Pravda continued, ``It is possible to say that such vitallyimportant decisions as the use of troops cannot be decided secretlyby a small circle of people, without the sanction of the parliamentof the country.''   The Soviet Parliament has been a rubber-stamp body for decades,but recent reforms under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev havestrengthened its role.   A spokesman for the Pakistan-based Jamiat-i-Islami guerrillagroup said its fighters captured 155 Afghan government soldiers and10 officers in an attack Saturday on the huge Bagram airbase, 24miles north of the capital.   He said 10 guerrillas were killed or wounded and that fightingcontinued today, but he gave no details, and there was noindependent confirmation.   Kabul state radio said guerrillas fired five rockets into thecapital on Tuesday, killing four children and an old man lined up inthe snow for bread.   It said two rockets landed at the airport.   The final Soviet troops in Kabul left aboard military transportplanes late Tuesday.   Soviet soldiers intervened in Afghanistan a year after a Marxistcoup touched off civil war with Moslem guerrillas. At the height ofits involvement, the Red Army had an estimated 115,000 soldiers inthe country.   Under a U.N.-mediated accord signed in Geneva in April, thewithdrawal began May 15.</TEXT></DOC>
