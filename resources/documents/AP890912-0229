Attempting to boost President Bush's new $7.9 billion drugpackage, the Justice Department decided to allocate the lion's shareof Drexel's criminal penalty to a fund that will be overseen by drugczar William J. Bennett.   Drexel pleaded guilty Monday to six felonies and began paying$650 million plus interest and civil insider trading penalties,closing a major chapter in the 3-year-old Wall Street corruptioncrackdown.   The New York investment firm immediately wrote certified checksto three government agencies and a bank that will manage a fundearmarked for civil damages claims against Drexel.   A check for $78 million _ the fine against Drexel calculatedunder federal law _ was sent to the U.S. Postal Service and will beused in part for white-collar criminal probes by that agency, U.S.Attorney Benito Romano said.   The remaining $222,196,770.97 criminal penalty was sent to theU.S. Marshals Service asset forfeiture fund, which Romano said comesunder Bennett's discretion starting Oct. 1.   The fund currently is used for prison construction and otherimmediate law enforcement needs. Next month, it switches exclusivelyto the war on drugs.   ``Clearly the Department of Justice wanted to see the Drexelcriminal fine help fund the law enforcement efforts including thewar on narcotics,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Cohen, whoheads the office's securities fraud unit.   Government officials said the fund now has about $250 million andwill nearly double thanks to the Drexel penalty.   The total fines and penalties against Drexel amounted to$673,237,260.28. All but $150 million of that was paid Monday.   Drexel's long-awaited plea followed months of legal wranglingover charges based largely on information from Ivan Boesky, theimprisoned stock speculator whose revelations about systematiclawbreaking have stunned the financial world since his arrest nearlythree years ago.   ``This terminates our investigation of Drexel as an entity,''Romano said at a news conference. ``Obviously their cooperation willlead us in other directions. Wherever those leads take us, we willgo.''   Drexel attorney Thomas F. Curnin entered the guilty plea beforeU.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood in Manhattan federal court.   The plea had been expected since Drexel and the governmentreached an agreement on the charges in January but was delayed bychallenges brought by Michael Milken, Drexel's former chief junkbond trader, who was indicted separately in March.   The plea triggered enactment of a separate settlement betweenDrexel and the Securities and Exchange Commission reached in Aprilthat places Drexel under unprecedented government supervision forthree years and revamps its management.   ``While it is for us a highly sobering event, we are determinedto make Drexel a model of how a securities firm ought to conduct itsbusiness in the '90s and to focus new energies and resources on theopportunities which lie ahead of us,'' Drexel said in a statement.   Drexel pleaded guilty to four counts of securities fraud and twocounts of mail fraud and agreed to pay the fines and penalties forillegal stock transactions involving the firm and Milken, Boesky andthe defunct Princeton-Newport Partners LP.   Boesky has given the government information for severalsecurities fraud prosecutions, including the conviction of fivePrinceton-Newport officials and former Drexel trader Bruce Newbergearlier this year and the fraud and racketeering indictment ofMilken, his brother Lowell and Newberg.   Drexel before had never publicly admitted to the crimes andJoseph told employees earlier this year the firm agreed to pleadguilty because it feared a racketeering indictment that could haveforced Drexel out of business.   Romano said the government was satisfied with the plea.   ``So long as it's not understood as undermining this admission ofguilty, then whatever they say to their employees ... is entirely upto them,'' he said.   Under the agreemement, Drexel paid $300 million in criminal finesand penalties, plus 8.55 percent interest, and set aside $200million of a total of $350 million in the civil fund. The remaining$150 million is to be paid over the next three years.   Drexel also paid $15.15 million plus interest to the SEC forpenalties under the federal Insider Trading Sanctions Act.</TEXT></DOC>
