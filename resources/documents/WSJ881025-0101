The freight railroad didn't estimate potential annual savings but said the move would eliminate less than 200 positions systemwide.    Other major railroads, including the rail units of CSX Corp., Richmond, Va., and Union Pacific Corp., Bethlehem, Pa., have recently streamlined their field managements. The moves are intended to help make railroads more competitive with trucks by cutting costs, and more responsive to customers by reducing layers of authority.    Richard Sanborn, president of Conrail, said its existing regional and division structure was largely inherited from the railroad's six bankrupt predecessors. He added that the new management structure will reflect the changes in routes, traffic flows and operations Conrail has made since it began operations April 1, 1976. </TEXT></DOC>
