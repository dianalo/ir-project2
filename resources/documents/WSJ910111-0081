Herbert E. Ehlers, head of the regional securities firm'sasset management unit, made a tidy $1.7 million last year,the firm's proxy shows. That's a 62% jump from a year earlier-- and the loftiest salary ever paid at the St. Petersburg,Fla., brokerage firm.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Ehlers's compensation, moreover, was nearly triplethat of Raymond James's chairman, Thomas A. James, who took a7% pay cut, to a mere $580,000.   Why the disparity? Although the firm posted a 41% gain inpretax profit -- much of it from asset-management revenue --the chairman says he penalized himself for making some badstock-picking calls.   &quot;We would have had a better year but for the errors of myways,&quot; Mr. James says in an interview.   Of course, overall pay at regional securities firms --which are smaller brokers based from from Wall Street --pales in comparison with that doled out at big New Yorkinvestment banks. Even Mr. Ehlers's pay falls far short ofthe dizzying $23 million paid last year to LawrenceHilibrand, a bond trader at Salomon Brothers Inc.   But the big gap at Raymond James underscores how muchprofit at regional firms are derived from managing customers'money, rather than stock-brokerage. In 1990, pretax profit atits Eagle Asset Management unit nearly doubled, to $13.5million; that represented 46% of Raymond James's total profitbefore taxes of $29 million, up from 34% in 1989.   The 51-year-old Mr. Ehlers is the president of Eagle,which manages more than $4 billion in assets. But Mr. Ehlersalso is Eagle's chief investment officer and personallymanages more than $2.5 billion of its assets.   Although he boasts a solid long-term record, 1990 wasn't agood year. His portfolio fell more than 5% -- his first yearever in the red -- even as the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stockindex dropped just 3.2%, with dividends reinvested. The primecasualties: cellular and entertainment stocks, which gothammered, the firm says.   For his part, Mr. Ehlers says his compensation reflectsnot only his portfolio performance, but also that of hisposition running Eagle Asset Management. &quot;To a certainextent, that is an entrepreunerial ownership bonus,&quot; Mr.Ehlers says. He adds that some of his 1990 pay was based on1989 performance for clients. Says Chairman James: &quot;He didn'thave a good year . . . but I don't think Herb is overpaidrelative to {other top porftolio managers} by any stretch ofthe imagination.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
