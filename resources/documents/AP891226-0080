(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Timothy Curry took his first name froman old newspaper, his last from some writing he spotted on the wallof a soup kitchen.   Curry can't recall his real name or where he came from. Indeedhe can't remember anything from before January 1988.   He said that's when he woke up in a Boston bus station, his minda total blank.   ``I feel like a lunatic sometimes because I don't know who I am.I have no identity. The only thing I know is how to live on thestreet,'' said Curry, who appears to be in his 20s.   Susan Grislis, director of the Rhode Island affiliate ofLiteracy Volunteers of America, tested Curry and concluded he hasat least a high school education.   But Curry said he was unfamiliar with World War I and Watergate.He knows the Beatles were a rock group because he read about themin Boston, but doesn't know their songs.   Curry lived on the streets of Boston, afraid to seek helpbecause he thought they would ``lock me up in a mental hospital andI wouldn't get out.''   He was befriended by a Bellingham, Mass., construction workerwho spotted him near Fenway Park in August 1988. Ralph Guisti, 54,visited Curry weekly and sometimes gave him money for food.   ``He didn't look human,'' Guisti said of his friend withdeep-green eyes and a scraggly brown beard. ``He was a person inneed.''   After months of urging, Guisti persuaded Curry to go to thehomeless shelter in Woonsocket, about five miles from Bellingham,and get help. Curry arrived Oct. 24 and can stay six months.   Shelter officials and Woonsocket police take Curry's claim ofamnesia seriously.   ``I haven't found anything to indicate that he might befeigning,'' said shelter director Paul Dempster. ``It's genuine.''He said Curry does not smoke, drink or use drugs.   Woonsocket police sent Curry's fingerprints to the FBI, whichdetermined he has no criminal or military record.   The police also distributed Curry's description _ 5 feet 7, 145pounds _ to police departments nationwide.   So far, the police have turned up nothing.   ``If it turns out that this individual doesn't have much in wayof family, then we might run into a roadblock,'' said Detective Lt.Michael Richardson. ``If nobody's filed a missing person report,there's nothing we can do about it.''   Curry has undergone psychological counseling at the NorthernRhode Island Community Mental Health Center.   Richard Crino, a registered psychiatric nurse, said it isimpossible to diagnose Curry's problem until he takes some moremedical tests. He said several illnesses, including a brain tumor,epilepsy and alcoholism, can produce memory loss.   To rule out an organic cause, officials at the health centerordered a brain scan, physical examination, blood tests and a testthat checks the brain's electrical potential. Curry has taken thefirst two, but refuses to take the others.   He said the brain scan made his eyes sensitive to light andirritated his sinuses.   Curry said he struggles to regain his memory.   ``I'd look at people and try to picture what my relatives mustlook like,'' he said. ``But there's nothing for me to remember.''   Dempster said he would like Curry to get a driver's license andSocial Security card in his adopted name soon, ``so he can startliving a normal lifestyle.''   For his part, Curry said, ``The only thing I can think of is ifthe police find my identity, or my memory comes back. That's theonly hope I have.''</TEXT></DOC>
