The report is likely to find a receptive ear at the White Housebecause the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, helped writeearly drafts, although he dropped out of the working group followinghis appointment.   The report reiterated a view previously stated by Scowcroft, butnot repeated publicly since he joined the administration, thatformer President Reagan's vision of a Star Wars umbrella againstnuclear attack would be impossible in the foreseeable future.   Research has made ``clear that there is no near-term prospectthat any combination of defensive sytems will make possibleexclusive reliance on defense to defeat the projected threat,'' saidthe report, drafted by members of the Foreign Policy Institute ofJohns Hopkins University and the Center for Strategic andInternational Studies, a pair of think tanks.   Spending should remain constant for strategic defenses ratherthan increasing sharply as requested by Reagan, group members said.   Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and John Warner, R-Va., the chairman andranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee,respectively, and Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., Nunn's counterpart in theHouse, presented the report at a news conference with formernational security adviser Robert McFarlane and former DefenseSecretary Harold Brown.   Congress is unlikely to increase defense spending this year, asrequested by Reagan in his final budget proposal, and the UnitedStates will not be able to pay for all the bombers, missiles,submarines and other systems underway.   Therefore, Congress and the administration must agree on whichare most urgently needed, deploy them first, and then add others asnecessary, they said.   Two of the three legs of the U.S. nuclear ``triad,'' the bomberand submarine forces, ``will survice any plausible Soviet attack,''it said.   ``We cannot, however, extend this confidence to our land-basedmissiles in silos,'' it said. ``Against a surprise attack by Sovietforces, in which only about one-third of their currently availableICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) warheads are used, onlyabout 5 percent of U.S. ICBMs would survive.''   The situation could worsen under the proposed Strategic ArmsReduction Treaty under negotiation between the United States and theSoviet Union, because it would reduce by about half the number ofdelivery systems. One side would require fewer weapons to knock outthe other's fixed land-based weapons.   Foremost among the group's recommendations was that theadministration and Congress agree to develop a mobileintercontinental ballistic missile class, to match two classesdeployed by the Soviets.   ``Mobility is key,'' said Aspin.   And they urged the administration to proceed cautiously on theB-2 stealth bomber to avoid a repeat of problems suffered by the B-1bomber, which was rushed through the development stage.   Nunn and Aspin also urged the new administration to drop Reagan'sproposed ban on mobile missiles, arguing that such weapons reducethe danger of nuclear war since it would be almost impossible for anadversary to destroy a significant percentage in a surprise attack.   The group leaned toward the small road-mobile Midgetman as thebest option, the same conclusion reached by a presidentialcommission headed by Scowcroft in 1983.   The Midgetman would be more expensive than other alternatives,however, costing an estimated $39 billion versus $12 billion for arail-mobile version of the 10-warhead MX missile and $19 billion to$40 billion for the so-called ``carry-hard'' approach, in which theMX, Midgetman or Minuteman III missile would be encased in capsuleshardened against nuclear attack and scattered in a deceptive patternamong a large number of silos.   Reagan, in proposing a budget for the next fiscal year, cut allmoney for the Midgetman in favor of the MX.</TEXT></DOC>
