Walsh of trying to punish former White Houseaide Oliver L. North and two co-defendants for trying to tellCongress the ``whole truth'' about the Iran-Contra affair.   The defense contends that Walsh was ``completely wrong on thelaw'' by claiming that hundreds of statements that North, formernational security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealer AlbertHakim made to Congress could be used against them as evidence ofcriminal wrongdoing.   By claiming the defendants waived their limited immunity grantsfrom Congress, Walsh ``seeks to punish defendants for respondingfully and in good faith to congressional inquiries, when compelledto do so over vehement objection, and for relaying to Congress andthe nation what occurred and why,'' the defense said in a brieffiled Tuesday.   Although North, Poindexter and Hakim testified under immunitygrants that prohibit use of their statements as evidence againstthem, Walsh contends that the defendants waived the privilegeagainst self-incrimination by volunteering answers that were notresponsive to questions posed by the Iran-Contra committees.   Walsh has said that he would not use any of this congressionaltestimony during the trial if the court denies a defense request toconduct an extensive hearing to determine if his investigation wastainted by impermissible use of the defendants' immunizedstatements.   The defense called Walsh's offer an attempt ``to threaten thecourt with a lengthy inquiry into immunized testimony, and then touse that threat as leverage to strike a favorable bargain with thecourt.''   ``This tactic is unseemly,'' the defense lawyers said in a jointpleading.   North, the fired National Security Council aide, Poindexter andHakim are accused of conspiring with retired Air Force Maj. Gen.Richard V. Secord to defraud the government by diverting Iranarms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. Secord, also an armsdealer, testified without an immunity grant from Congress.   North, Poindexter and Hakim contend that their Fifth Amendmentright against self-incrimination would be violated if they wereforced to stand trial on criminal charges following their compelledcongressional testimony. They claim that Walsh's prosecution wastainted by illegal use of their sworn statements to Congress.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell is scheduled to heararguments on the issue on Thursday.   In its latest filing, the defense said ``there is no claim thatdefendants uttered a single word, during the course of theircongressional testimony, that was outside the subject matter of thecongressional inquiry.''   North, Poindexter and Hakim were not waiving any rights whenthey ``explained their answers; or sought to provide useful,related information to be sure their answers were complete andaccurate _ in short, the `whole truth' they had sworn to provide.''   The defense said Walsh's position would force Gesell to examineeach and every one of the hundreds of statements to verify Walsh'sclaim they were exempt from immunity.   Walsh contended that the unprotected statements includePoindexter's admission that he approved the diversion of arms-saleprofits to the Contras but did not tell President Reagan to ensurethat the president could deny involvement if the operation wereexposed.   The unprotected statements also include Poindexter's remarksthat during Attorney General Edwin Meese III's November 1986investigation, Poindexter destroyed a presidential intelligencefinding authorizing CIA involvement in one 1985 arms shipment,Walsh contended.   Walsh also claimed that North's statements that he destroyeddocuments in October and November 1986 could be used as evidence toprove charges that the fired National Security Council aideobstructed Meese's inquiry.   In a separate filing on Tuesday, Walsh's office said that ``itis clear beyond doubt'' that North, Poindexter and Hakim waged a``public relations battle'' during their congressional testimony.   ``In utter defiance of the questions put to them, they sought towin with speeches and arguments,'' the prosecution brief said.</TEXT></DOC>
