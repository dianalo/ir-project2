Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister and OPEC's president, said that auditing of production by outside accountants will begin this month as the central part of the new attempt to curb violations of output quotas.    Klynveld Kraayenhof, a Dutch accounting firm that is now an affiliate of Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co., will carry out the audits -- after an inauspicious engagement to help OPEC monitor compliance in 1985 and 1986. At the time, some OPEC members wouldn't allow the auditors past their borders. And in one case, in Nigeria, the Dutch firm had to send in a new team of auditors after the first group of three was arrested at the airport, jailed and then expelled for alleged currency violations.    Since the 1986 oil-price collapse, however, OPEC's mood, as well as the governments of some member countries, have changed. The oil ministers had the support of the heads of state of all 13 member countries, for example, when they agreed at their December meeting to the new production-control system -- with details of the new program left up to Mr. Lukman of Nigeria.    &quot;This time,&quot; said a senior OPEC official who has been critical of past quota-compliance systems, &quot;there is a sincere desire to convince the market that OPEC isn't overproducing.&quot;    Only coincidentally, the new program comes at a time OPEC output has fallen to the lowest level in more than eight months -- causing several leading oil ministers to turn bullish on oil prices. Mr. Lukman, who is among those predicting an oil-price rally, estimated that OPEC production has fallen to between 16 million and 16.5 million barrels a day -- down three million barrels a day from the most recent peak and well within the limits of current individual-country quotas.    Mr. Lukman's figures aren't out of line with new industry estimates, which range from 16.5 million to 17.5 million barrels, compared with a December average of more than 18.5 million.    Among industry analysts, considerable doubt remains that the production cutbacks since December have been entirely voluntary. Refiners are balking at paying official OPEC prices and instead are buying oil on the spot market, or are drawing down inventories.    Nonetheless, confirmation by the Dutch accounting firm that OPEC's production is well within its ceiling could have a firming effect on oil markets. The only problem, as some OPEC officials see it, is the thoroughness in which Klynveld is approaching the new audits.    &quot;The auditors are slow,&quot; said one OPEC official. &quot;By the time they come up with February figures, it will be April.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
