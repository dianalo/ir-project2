After a nine-month trial in Chicago's Cook County CriminalCourt, Judge Earl Strayhorn ruled that the company had metsafety standards set by the federal Occupational Safety andHealth Administration. The judge also said prosecutors didn'tprove workers had been injured as a result of workplaceconditions or that the defendants had any intention ofharming workers.</LP><TEXT>   The 1984 indictment resulted in the longest criminal trialin Illinois history. It was the nation's first case in whichemployers were criminally charged with aggravated battery forallegedly harming workers by exposing them to toxicchemicals.   Chicago Magnet Wire, a unit of North American PhilipsCorp., is based in Elk Grove Village, Ill., and coats wirefor use in transformers. North American Philips is asubsidiary of Philips N.V. of the Netherlands.   &quot;After seven years and a nine-month trial, our clients arefinally vindicated,&quot; said William Martin, of the Oak Park,Ill., law firm Martin andamp; Breen, one of the defense attorneys.   Cook County State's Attorney Jack O'Malley said, &quot;We'redisappointed in the outcome. But this will not deter us fromprosecuting future cases where facts show us that workers'safety is in jeopardy or that owners of factories orbusinesses may be operating in a criminal manner.&quot;   Nevertheless legal experts said the acquittals could havea chilling effect on a trend toward more state criminalprosecutions of employers in workplace injury cases. Illinoisis one of four states where supreme courts have ruled thatthe federal government's Occupational Safety and Health Actdoesn't pre-empt local prosecutors from bringing their owncriminal cases against employers who knowingly endangerworkers. The other states are New York, Michigan and Texas.Lower courts in several other states have also allowed localprosecutions.   Most state laws provide for tougher sanctions againstemployers in workplace cases than do federal laws. Underfederal law, a wrongful death in a workplace injury case is amisdemeanor and the maximum sentence is only six months inprison.   The Chicago acquittals, said some lawyers, could bolsterthe legislative push to toughen the federal laws in suchcases.   &quot;The perception may be that it's unreasonable to expectlocal prosecutors with limited resources to take on thesecases,&quot; said William Maakestad, a business law professor atWestern Illinois University. &quot;And this belief may shift theenforcement to the federal level and put pressure on Congressto strengthen the laws.&quot;   At the Chicago trial, prosecutors compared the ChicagoMagnet Wire factory to the sweatshops of the mid-19thcentury. They accused the company's executives of knowingabout the conditions, which they allege caused lung andkidney disorders, rashes, impotence and other ailments.   Most of the 108 witnesses for the prosecution were formerworkers. Some described temperatures approaching nearly 200degrees on catwalks at the plant in summer. The air wasfilled with fumes, dense smoke and copper and aluminum dust,they claimed.   The defendants, including the company, were each chargedwith 82 counts of aggravated battery and 41 counts ofreckless conduct involving 37 workers. The five individualdefendants each were also charged with one count ofconspiracy involving 109 workers.   Defense attorneys claimed that there had been hysteria atthe plant in part because 80 of the alleged victims weretreated by the same doctor, who warned them about thepossibility of cancer because of exposure to toxic fumes.   ---   FDIC CAN SUE officers and directors only for grossnegligence, judge rules.   In a decision that could hamper efforts by the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. to recover the losses of failed banksfrom officers and directors, a federal judge threw out theFDIC's claims against the directors of a failed Salt LakeCity bank.   The FDIC had sued the directors and officers of TracyCollins Bank andamp; Trust Co., seeking $7 million in damagesstemming from &quot;imprudent&quot; loans, waste of the bank's assetsand mismanagement, according to the decision by Judge DavidSam of Salt Lake City.   But the judge ruled that under the Financial InstitutionsReform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, there is a&quot;minimum standard of gross negligence&quot; in civil suits againstofficers and directors of failed banks, even in such statesas Utah that allow lower standards of negligence in suitsagainst officers and directors of corporations. It was thefirst time a federal judge had ruled on the issue.   &quot;The cost of pursuing officers and directors of failedinstitutions is enormous,&quot; Judge Sam wrote in his opinion.&quot;Congress saw that the public is best served when enforcementand regulatory efforts and dollars are directed towardconduct amounting to gross negligence or intentionalwrongdoing rather than ordinary negligence or simple breachof fiduciary duty.&quot;   Daniel L. Berman, the Salt Lake lawyer who representedmost of the defendants, said the decision would require theFDIC &quot;to meet a higher degree of fault or aggravated fault. .. . The ordinary director sitting there doing his job isn'tgoing to be second-guessed over what he's done.&quot;   A portion of the case against three officers involvingalleged excessive compensation remains pending, said Mr.Berman, of the law firm Berman andamp; O'Rorke.   Warren Patten, of the Salt Lake City law firm Fabian andamp;Clendenin, who represented the FDIC, said the case was &quot;verysignificant,&quot; but declined further comment. A spokeswoman forthe FDIC said the agency couldn't comment because it wasstill reviewing the decision.   The bank, now known as West One Bank of Boise, Idaho,acquired the assets of Tracy Collins in 1988.   ---   SEC ALLEGES FRAUD SCHEME that victimized Eastern Europeanimmigrants.   The Securities and Exchange Commission accused a fatherand his son of bilking more than 1,200 investors out of $34million in an illegal securities offering.   In a civil suit filed in federal court in Manhattan, theSEC alleged that Polish immigrant Eugene R. Karczewski andEugene F. Karczewski Jr. sold securities called &quot;investoragreements&quot; in an unregistered public offering. The SEC isseeking a permanent injunction against the men, the return of$7 million of allegedly illegal profits, plus penalties.   The SEC said the Karczewskis -- who headed the now-defunctStockbridge Funding Corp. -- told investors their funds wouldbe used for triple-secured mortgage lending with a guaranteed14% return. They said the securities were &quot;as safe as federalbonds,&quot; according to the complaint. The SEC alleged that theKarczewskis used the funds for personal purposes or high-riskmortgage lending. It also alleged that even after thecompany's bankruptcy court filing in 1989, the Karczewskissolicited new funds to pay interest and principal to previousinvestors.   The SEC said Stockbridge solicited investors throughadvertising on Polish-language cable television programs andforeign-language newspapers in the New York metropolitanarea.   Marvin B. Segal, an attorney for the elder Mr. Karczewski,said he will try to demonstrate his client's innocence. &quot;Formany years, Stockbridge was a highly successful company thatmade a lot of money for a lot of people,&quot; Mr. Segal said.   Mr. Karczewski Jr. wasn't available for comment.   ---   CONVICTED BATTERER DENIED insurance coverage for liabilityto victim.   Ariel Hessing had sought coverage under his father'shomeowner insurance policies for his former girlfriend'sclaims for medical costs and other damages. Mr. Hessingpleaded guilty to beating the woman, whose suit against himis pending, at his father's home in Berkeley Heights, N.J.,in July 1985.   New Jersey State Superior Court Judge Burton Ironson inElizabeth dismissed Mr. Hessing's claim this week, rulingfrom the bench that two insurers don't have to providecoverage, because Mr. Hessing's act was intentional.   &quot;The decision sends a signal that people who lash out attheir wives or girlfriends will have to personally pay andcannot transfer the responsibility to an insurance carrier,&quot;said James Rothschild, a Morristown lawyer for HarleysvilleMutual Insurance Co. of Harleysville, Pa. The other insurerwas Cambridge Mutual Insurance Co. in Cambridge, Mass.   Michael Mitzner, a Fanwood lawyer representing Mr.Hessing, said his client was considering asking the court torehear the issue.

The racketeering allegations were made by actress RoseanneBarr after the tabloid newspaper printed an intimate lettershe wrote to her husband, actor and producer Tom Arnold.   A federal judge in Los Angeles let stand seven othercounts, including invasion of privacy, copyright infringementand intentional inflicting of emotional harm.   Ms. Barr had alleged that the Enquirer had violated theRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law bydirectly or indirectly inducing people to steal personalinformation about celebrities and transporting it acrossstate lines.   Morton Rosen, Ms. Barr's attorney at the Santa Monica,Calif., law firm Haight, Brown andamp; Bonesteel, said thenewspaper could be construed to be a racketeering enterpriseand that he intends to appeal.   ---   CBS MUST GIVE UP videotapes for use in criminal trial.   Florida's highest court ruled that CBS Inc. must turn overuntelevised videotapes of the arrest of a defendant oncocaine possession charges to his lawyer.

Levine, the Fort Lauderdale lawyer forMr. Jackson.   Douglas Jacobs, a CBS attorney, said the company mayconsider taking the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.   ---   JOHNSON andamp; JOHNSON is no longer a defendant in Retin-Asuit.   A federal judge has ruled that University Patents Inc., aplaintiff in a dispute over the rights to the skin care drugRetin-A, failed to file its suit against a subsidiary ofJohnson andamp; Johnson, of New Brunswick, N.J., by the legaldeadline. Dr. Albert M. Kligman, the inventor of Retin-A, isnow the sole defendant in the suit.   Early this week, Judge Jay C. Walman of Philadelphiadenied a motion to dismiss a contract lawsuit against Dr.Kligman, who developed Retin-A while working as a researcherand professor at the University of Pennsylvania School ofMedicine.   University Patents, the school's licensing agent, alsosued Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., the Johnson andamp; Johnsonsubsidiary that markets the drug.   Ellen M.
