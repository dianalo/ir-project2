Approximately 60 populations are knownto occur throughout the species range from New Jersey to Georgia. Thirty-fiveof the known populations occur in the freshwater wetlands of New Jersey'scoastal plain. Eight populations are known in Virginia, North Carolinahas seven, and Delaware has six populations. Georgia, Maryland and SouthCarolina each have one known population, and the plant is believed to beextirpated from New York.

Although thefirst collection of the plant is uncertain, it probably occurred in thePhiladelphia area in the mid-1700's by Swedish naturalist Peter Kalm. Basedon Kalm's collections, the plant was described by Linnaeus in the firstedition of <T3>Species Plantarum </T3>(Brown 1910). This perennial species is strikingly attractive and very distinctive. Ithas many smooth, lance-shaped, evergreen leaves, which grow in a basalrosette from a tuberous rhizome. The stout, hollow stem is 1-2 feet (3-6decimeters (dm)) tall and is topped by a short, dense raceme of pink orpurplish flowers that appear in April or early May. The species inhabitsa variety of freshwater wetlands including spring seepages, swamps, bogs,meadows, and margins of meandering small streams. The most significant threat to <T3>Helonias bullata </T3>is the direct loss or alteration of its wetlandhabitats. Many eastern States have lost a significant percentage of theirwetlands since the mid-1900's (Tiner 1986). Ditching and draining of lowlandsfor agricultural purposes and logging of hardwood swamps is continuing,but the greatest ongoing threat is the direct filling or alteration ofinland wetlands due to expanding urbanization. Loss of swamp pink habitatcan be attributed to channelization for flood control, ditching and drainingfor increased agriculture, and filling for housing projects, industrialdevelopments, and highways. The quality of wetlands has also been degradedby sedimentation, water pollution and waste disposal. Several New Jerseypopulations of <T3>Helonias bullata </T3>have been completely destroyed or severely depletedby severe erosion and siltation from housing project construction activities.Approximately 100 populations were known to exist historically in the Stateof New Jersey. Only 35-40 populations exist there today, and most of thehistorical sites are presumed lost to the filling, draining, and developmentof wetland habitats. A few populations have been found as a result of recentintensive field surveys but these new populations are small and usuallyin the vicinity of another existing colony. Some protection from developmentis provided to those populations that occur within the Pine Barrens NationalReserve. These colonies are small, however, and virtually all of the State'slargest populations are on private land outside of the Reserve and vulnerableto expanding urbanization (Snyder 1981). Seven populations are known to occur in North Carolina, the largest ofwhich is on Forest Service property. The remaining colonies are on privateor corporate land. In North Carolina the plants are found exclusively inmountain bogs. This type of habitat is very rare in the State and localexperts have thoroughly searched most areas where the swamp pink couldpotentially occur (Sutter 1984). <T3>Helonias bullata </T3>is listed as a threatened species under NorthCarolina's State Plant Law (N.C. General Statute 19-B, 202.12-202.19) whichprovides protection from intrastate trade and provisions for monitoringand proper management. Destruction of swamp pink habitat has been particularly severe in Delawaredue to agricultural drainage and urbanization. Five colonies are knownto have been lost to development and only six extant populations remainin the State. Some potential habitat remains to be checked but the possibilitiesof finding any significant populations are remote. The Delaware Departmentof Natural Resources and Environmental Control is working toward the protectionof the most significant colonies. Eight populations are known to occur in Virginia, five of which, includingone of the State's largest, are on Federal land. One population occurson Park Service land and four on U.S. Forest Service property. Three ForestService populations are offered some protection because they occur withinSpecial Interest Areas or Wilderness Areas and the Forest Service is diligentlyworking to protect the plants. The remaining populations are on privateproperty. Georgia, South Carolina and Maryland have only one known population each.The swamp pink occurs in high mountain bogs in Georgia and South Carolina.This habitat type is very limited in both States and local experts believethere is little chance of discovering additional populations. The Georgiaplants occur on private land and the South Carolina plants occur on StateHeritage Trust Land which was recently purchased to protect the site. Thesingle Maryland population occurs on private land and is threatened bycutting and thinning of trees and other woody vegetation. Another historicalpopulation in the State was destroyed by ditching and draining of its wetlandhabitat for increased agriculture. The swamp pink reaches its northern limit of range in New York. The NewYork plants were reported to occur on Staten Island and were last seenin the late 1800's. Surveys have been conducted in other potential habitatsand the plant is now believed to be extirpated from the State. Previousrecords of the plants' occurrence in the State of Pennsylvania are believedto be in error. <T3>Helonias bullata </T3>was first recognized by the Service in the comprehensive<T4>Federal Register </T4>notice of December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480). Theswamp pink was recognized as a ``Category 2'' candidate, the category inwhich it remained in the 1985 updated notice (50 FR 39526). Category 2candidates are taxa for which existing information indicates the possibleappropriateness of proposing to list as endangered or threatened, but forwhich sufficient information is not presently available to biologicallysupport a proposed rule. The Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1982 required that all petitionspending as of October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submittedon that date. The deadline for a finding on those species, including <T3>Helonias bullata</T3>, was October 13, 1983. In October of 1983, 1984,1985, 1986, and 1987, the petition finding was made that listing <T3>Helonias bullata </T3>was warranted but precluded by other pendinglisting actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(iii) of the Act. Suchfindings require a yearly recycling of the petition, pursuant to section4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. This proposal constitutes the final one-yearfinding on the petition for this species. In the fall of 1986 the Service completed a project with the Eastern RegionalOffice of The Nature Conservancy that assessed the range-wide status of32 plant candidates including <T3>Helonias bullata. </T3>Extensive field searches were conducted in eachState throughout the species' range under direction of the State NaturalHeritage Programs. As a result of these investigations, the Conservancyrecommended that <T3>Helonias bullata </T3>warranted Federal protection under the EndangeredSpecies Act as a threatened species. This proposed rule constitutes theService's concurrence with that recommendation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq</T3>.) and regulations promulgated to implement the listingprovisions of the Act (50 CFR Part 424) set forth the procedures for addingspecies to the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be an endangeredor threatened species due to one or more of the five factors describedin section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to <T3>Helonias bullata </T3>Linnaeus are as follows:A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or curtailmentof its Habitat or RangeThe most significant threat to <T3>Helonias bullata </T3>is the direct loss or alteration of its wetlandhabitats. The plant has been extirpated from many sites in the mid-AtlanticStates due to expanding residential, commercial and industrial developments.Increased development has not only directly destroyed important wetlandhabitats but pollution and sedimentation, associated with urban and agriculturalrunoff have adversely impacted remaining habitats and the sites are nolonger suitable for the species.Ditching and draining of lowland areas to improve or create additionalagricultural land have altered the groundwater table of swamp pink habitats.The alteration of the water table modifies vegetative succession permittingother more aggressive or non-native plants to become established. Additionally,because the swamp pink seems to prefer ``seepage or spring swamps'' forsuccessful growth and reproduction, changes in natural succession of thewoody vegetation due to a modified groundwater table have adversely impactedswamp pink populations.The single Maryland population occurs in the approach path to a major airport.Due to safety regulations and instrumentation requirements, the vegetationin the approach corridor needs to be periodically cut, removed, trimmed,etc. Fish and Wildlife Service and State natural resource agency representativeshave met with airport officials to discuss management alternatives thatwould conserve the site yet not compromise safety considerations. A managementagreement for the site is currently being formulated with the State AviationAdministration. The agreement would protect the area where the plants occur,however, other potential private developments adjacent to the site arecause for concern.B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific or EducationalPurposes<T3>Helonias bullata </T3>is referred to as one of the most beautiful plantsin the eastern United States in several wildflower books and field guides.Its striking beauty has caused the plant to be sought by garden hobbyistsand curiosity seekers. Many plants have also been taken for scientificpurposes in documenting the species' range and distribution. Plants havebeen frequently taken from the single Georgia population by botanists andprivate collectors without the knowledge and consent of the landowner.The plant is also known as a highly desirable species for home wildflowergardens. A popular wildflower garden guide, <T3>How to Grow Wildflowers, Wild Shrubs and Trees in Your Own Garden,</T3>identifies the desirability of the swamp pink and recommends the plantfor private gardens. Commercial collecting and selling of wild plants,however, does not appear to be significant at this time. A few commercialnurseries or gardens do sell plants cultivated from seed.C. Disease or Predation Disease is not known to be a threat to existing populations. Deer haveextensively browsed some swamp pink colonies, but what specific role deermay play in the life history and ecology of the plant has not as yet beendetermined. D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms North Carolina and Georgia are the only States that have placed <T3>Helonias bullata </T3>on an official State list. The North Carolinalegislation to protect rare plants provides protection from intrastatetrade, and contains provisions for monitoring and proper management. TheGeorgia Wild Flower Preservation Act of 1973 prohibits digging, removal,or sale of State listed plants from public lands without the approval ofthe Georgia Department of Natural Resources. The single Georgia population,however, is on private land. Section 404 of the Federal Water PollutionControl Act could potentially provide some protection to the species' habitats;however, many of the sites where the plants occur may not meet ``wetlands''criteria under Section 404. E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting its Continued Existence Alteration or modification of the groudwater table by activities adjacentto <T3>Helonias bullata </T3>sites could indirectly impact the species' habitatsand requirements for growth. Several swamp pink populations, particularlyin the southern portion of the species' range, are associated with morenorthern plant communities. Groundwater-influenced soils help maintainthe required perennial cool temperature regimes. Ditching and drainingof adjacent lands for agricultural purposes, suburban development, industrialparks, etc., or the withdrawal of groundwater for public water supply couldalter the groundwater regime in the plants' habitat and adversely impactthe species. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific information availableregarding the past, present, and future threats faced by this species indetermining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the preferredaction is to list <T3>Helonias bullata </T3>as threatened. Due to the small number of populationsand the threats to its wetland habitats the plant is in need of protection.In addition, the protection of the specific areas where the plants occurmay not provide sufficient protection if development projects or otheractions in the watershed significantly affect the local groundwater regime.An understanding of the species and its habitat requirements are importantconsiderations in the protection and recovery strategy for the species.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a specieswhich is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. The designation of critical habitat isnot considered to be prudent when such designation would not be of benefitto the species involved (50 CFR 424.12). In the present case, the Servicebelieves that designation of critical habitat would not be prudent, becauseno benefit to the taxon can be identified that would outweigh the potentialthreat of collection, which might be caused by the publication of a detailedcritical habitat description and map. <ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal and State agencies, private conservation organizations, andindividuals. The Nature Conservancy and State natural resource agenciesare actively working to protect the sites of several populations. The singleSouth Carolina population was recently purchased to protect the area asState Heritage Trust Land under auspices of the South Carolina Wildlifeand Marine Resources Department.Four of the known swamp pink populations occur in National Forests. Thisproposed rule has been discussed with Forest Service personnel and theyare supportive and are taking action to conserve and protect the species.The swamp pink colonies on Forest Service land are within officially designatedSpecial Interest Areas or Wilderness Areas. Conservation and protectionof the unique habitats and natural resources in these areas has high priority.Other conservation measures, including required protection efforts by Federalagencies and prohibition against taking are discussed, in part below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened, and with respect to its critical habitat, ifany is being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act, are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4)requires Federal agencies to informally confer with the Service on anyaction that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposedspecies or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed criticalhabitat. When a species is listed, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy oradversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect alisted species or its critical habitat, the responsible agency must enterinto formal consultation with the Service. There are no known Federal projectsat this time that may affect <T3>Helonias bullata. </T3>The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.71 and 17.71set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptions that applyto all threatened plant species. With respect to <T3>Helonias bullata </T3>all trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) ofthe Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.71 would apply. With certain exceptions,these prohibitions make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdictionof the United States to import or export, any threatened plant, transportit in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity,sell or offer it for sale in interstate or foreign commerce, or removeit from areas under Federal jurisdiction and reduce it to possess. Seedsfrom cultivated specimens of threatened plant species are exempt from theseprohibitions provided that a statement of ``cultivated origin'' appearson their containers. The Act and 50 CFR 17.17 also provide for the issuanceof permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving threatenedspecies under certain circumstances. Commercial trade in wild <T3>Helonias bullata </T3>is not known to exist at this time, althoughsome plants grown in cultivation from seed are known to be sold by a fewprivate nurseries. The Service, therefore, anticipates a few requests forpermits. Requests for copies of the regulations on plants and inquiriesregarding them may be addressed to the Office of Management Authority,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 27329, Washington, DC 20038-7329.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited </ITAG>The Service intends that any final rule adopted will be accurate and aseffective as possible in the conservation of endangered or threatened species.Therefore, any comments or suggestions from the public, other concernedgovernmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any otherinterested party concerning any aspect of this proposed rule are herebysolicited. Comments are particularly sought concerning: (1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to <T3>Helonias bullata</T3>; (2) The location of any additional populations of this species and thereasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be criticalhabitat as provided by section 4 of the Act; (3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thisspecies; and (4) Current or planned activities that may impact existing populations.Final promulgation of a regulation on <T3>Helonias bullata </T3>will take into consideration the comments andany additional information received by the Service, and such communicationsmay lead to a final regulation that differs from this proposal. The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposalif requested. Requests must file within 45 days of the date of the proposal.Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to the Regional Director,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, One Gateway Center, Suite 700, Newton Corner,Massachusetts 02158. <ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.
