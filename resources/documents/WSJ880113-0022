The costly new helicopter was considered a cornerstone of the Army's modernization. But the Army stumbled in getting the project off the ground, and by the time the Army was nearing key decisions on the project, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci's budget ax fell.    A final decision is expected today.    Two teams of contractors were working on the LHX project, anticipating a competition from which the Army would select one team to build the new helicopter. One team consists of the McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. unit of McDonnell Douglas Corp. and the Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. unit of Textron Inc. The other team consists of Boeing Co.'s Boeing Vertol Co. division and United Technologies Corp.'s Sikorsky Aircraft division.    Although the expected cancellation of the LHX deprives the contractors of revenue they anticipated, the move isn't entirely bad news for Sikorsky and McDonnell Douglas, which have existing helicopter programs that will receive higher funding as a result of the cancellation. Indeed, the Army had proposed killing the McDonnell Douglas Apache helicopter in order to keep the LHX project afloat. According to a senior Pentagon official, aides to Mr. Carlucci &quot;argued that the LHX wasn't that much of an improvement over the Apache.&quot;    The Army had planned the high-technology LHX, which stands for light helicopter experimental, to replace Vietnam-era Huey and Cobra aircraft. The Army wanted to build 4,168 LHXs in two versions: one heavily armed for knocking out tanks and hostile helicopters and another for landing troops on battlefields. Production would have stretched into the late 1990s, and the LHX program would have been the largest ever developed by the Army.    The program has been controversial because of its high cost and because of frequent shifts in the Army's design and performance specifications for the system over the last two years.    The move reflects Mr. Carlucci's budget-cutting approach: shrink forces in order to keep them ready to fight. Mr. Carlucci has elsewhere called for canceling costly new weapons systems. The Air Force is ditching the mobile Midgetman nuclear missile, and the Navy has decided to drop the Grumman Corp. A-6F attack plane.    &quot;Readiness and sustainability are not going to be sacrificed,&quot; a Pentagon official said yesterday of Mr. Carlucci's strategy. &quot;He's not going to go for anything that smacks of a hollow Army.&quot;    In addition to losing its new helicopter, the Army is being forced to cut troop levels. After a bitter fight to maintain the present active-duty forces of 781,000, the Army now is planning to chop 10,000 troops. The Army will accomplish this by canceling a new light-infantry brigade that it had planned to station in Alaska and by cutting an already active brigade deployed elsewhere.    Meanwhile, the Navy has agreed to retire 16 ships ahead of schedule, and the Air Force is reducing its tactical fighter wings, which each has 72 planes, to 35 from the current 38. </TEXT></DOC>
