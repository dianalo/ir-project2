(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>TESTED METTLEandM;The Hewlett-Packard 9000/835 is a RISC-based &quot;superworkstation&quot;, a categoryof systems that did not exist at all two years ago.andP;  In performance, it iscurrently the high end of Hewlett-Packard's workstation line.andP;  The 9000/835runs the HP-UX operating system (which is standard on the company's 9000series systems) and is hardware-compatible with the somewhatlower-performance and less expensive HP 9000/825.andP;  It is available with awide variety of memory sizes, video-display cards, I/O options, and otherperipherals.andP;  The basic 835 system is designed for multiuser configurationsand starts at $45,000, but a typical workstation configuration with diskdrive and graphics accelerator is priced in the $90,000 range.andP;  Together withthe 9000/300 68020- and 68030-based systems, the 835 gives Hewlett-Packard arange of systems over an extremely broad price and performance spectrum.andM;The HP 835 is available in two system types.andP;  The 835S is a multiuser systemthat is designed to connect to serial terminals and is used primarily incommercial multiuser applications.andP;  Other 835 systems are used asworkstations and come with graphics boards, a monitor, a keyboard, and amouse.andP;  All HP 835 systems use HP's Precision Architecture RISC instructionset.andP;  The 835 uses the same instruction set as--and is binary-compatiblewith--the 825.andP;  In fact, the only difference between 825 and 835 systems isthe processor card and its speed; Hewlett-Packard rates the 835's performanceas 2.1 times better than the 825's.andP;  The peripherals, chassis, and othercards used with the two systems are identical.andM;The HP 835 processor card plugs into a special slot in the system chassis, asdoes another card used for system support functions.andP;  In addition to thesetwo special slots, there are seven card positions for memory and seven morefor I/O interfaces.andP;  A base workstation will also come with one memory board(providing 8 or 16 MB of RAM using one memory slot) and HP-IB and Ethernetcards, which will use two of the I/O positions.andP;  If necessary, an externalcard cage can be added for additional I/O devices.andP;  The seven memory slots inthe system chassis give the 835S a maximum of 112 MB of RAM.andP;  For workstationsystems, however, a pair of slots (one for I/O and one for memory) are usedby a special video-display card interface.andP;  This interface adapter thencables to an external box that contains the actual video-display card and anyoptional graphics accelerators.andM;Interestingly, the display card and adapter in the external box are the samecards that are used in the HP 9000/300 series 68020 and 68030 systems.andO;Display card options provide either 2D or 3D graphics at several performanceranges.andP;  The standard display resolution is 1280 x 1024.andP;  A daughterboardserves as a 2D graphics accelerator.andP;  For 3D graphics, a separate 3D-graphicslogic box is used.andP;  A 19-inch color monitor is standard on 835 workstations,although a less expensive 16-inch color monitor is available as an option.andM;The smallest memory board available for the 835 is an 8 MB unit.andP;  Boards with16 MB are also available and, while it is possible to run an 835 with 8 MB ofmemory, 16 MB or more is recommended.andP;  In all 835 systems a floating-pointchip is standard on the processor card.andP;  The system unit itself, containingthe processor, memory, power supply, and I/O cards, is a relatively small box(9 x 13 x 20 inches).andM;As with other members of the HP 9000 family, disk and tape drives and otherperipherals are connected via an HP-IB bus to the processor cabinet.andP;  Diskdrives are available with a storage capacity of 152 MB or more, and cartridgetape drives in two capacities are also available.andP;  Typically, the 835 needs300 MB or more of disk storage.andP;  On systems of its size and performancecapabilities, nine-track tape drives are also commonly used, and HP hasseveral options for these units.andM;The keyboard and mouse connect to the system through an HP-HIL bus thatallows up to seven devices to be used as input devices.andP;  The HP-HIL busarrangement makes expansion and interconnection of these devices very easy.andO;The mouse is a ball type that does not require a special pad, and thekeyboard has a solid, pleasant feel.andM;As with other HP systems, each device--the system unit, disk drive, tapedrive, and external graphics controller--has its own case.andP;  These separateboxes, connected by cables, together form the complete system.andP;  The tradeoffin having more cables and power cords instead of a fully-integrated box isthat expansion is virtually unlimited (most systems are limited by what canfit into the initial system box).andP;  As an option, Hewlett-Packard will supplya cabinet into which all of the small component boxes can be mounted.andP;  Thisfloor-standing case holds the entire system in a compact package.andM;Standard on the 835 is the HP-UX operating system, the company's version ofUNIX.andP;  It is licensed for 16 users and includes a C compiler, NFS networking,X11 windows, and a host of other software packages.andP;  FORTRAN and othercompilers are optional.andP;  Unlike lower-end 68020 or 68030 models in the HPfamily, for which documentation is available as an option, documentation andmedia are included in the cost of 835 systems.andP;  As discussed below, the HP-UXoperating system on the 835 is virtually identical to the operating systemused on the 68020 and 68030 models, despite differences between RISC andMotorola instruction sets.andP;  Users familiar with the HP 9000/300 series' HP-UXversion will find that all of the features--including the warts--of theoperating system have been carried over to the HP 835 product.andM;The configuration we reviewed included the base processor box with CPU and 24MB of memory.andP;  In addition, we had the 2D graphics unit with optional 2Daccelerator, a 19-inch color monitor, a 304 MB hard disk, and an Ethernetinterface.andP;  We also had the optional power-fail battery backup unit designedfor the system.andP;  Software included the full HP-UX standard set and theoptional FORTRAN compiler.andP;  Graphics packages standard with the operatingsystem include both X11 and HP's proprietary Starbase graphics package.andO;System cost, not including battery backup, was $89,625.andM;PurchasingandM;Hewlett-Packard workstations are normally purchased through HP sales offices,which are found throughout the world.andP;  The people selling the workstationsare dedicated to that task, and are quite knowledgeable; HP seems to havestrong technical support available in its offices.andP;  As is typica for directsales, prices on the HP systems are less negotiable than prices charged forproducts sold through alternative and more competitive channels, such asretail computer stores.andM;Hardware and software availability for the system seems adequate, withdelivery times quoted at 30 to 60 days for systems.andP;  First customer shipmentsof the HP 835 were made in 1988.andP;  Discounts from the list price are availablethrough HP, but are controlled by corporate policy.andP;  Also, 825 systems  canbe upgraded to 835 systems--only the processor card needs to be replaced.andP;  Itseems likely, but is not guaranteed, that HP's next generation of RISCworkstation systems will be similar to the HP 835 but again have a differentCPU card--that is, the 835 will probably have a future upgrade path.andM;Since we reviewed the HP 9000/360 in &quot;Tested Mettle&quot; late last year (see UNIXREVIEW, Vol.andP;  6 No.andP;  11), Hewlett-Packard has reorganized its price list.andO;The new list is easier to use than its predecessor, the major problem nowbeing that there are so many options available for the 800 series.andP;  Theresult is a price list that is long and complicated.andP;  However,Hewlett-Packard also publishes the HP 9000 Series 800 System ConfigurationGuide, which is by far the best document of its kind we have seen.andP;  Theconfiguration guide, combined with the price list, allows users to understandoptions and prices, and to configure a system that is likely to be coherent.andO;The configuration guide is something that, to my knowledge, othermanufacturers do not supply at this time, and is a major sales advantage forHewlett-Packard.andM;InstallationandM;Customers are responsible for software installation.andP;  The software is notpreloaded on the HP 835, but HP systems have the best customer-installprocedures that we have used.andP;  The operating system is supplied on onecartridge system is supplied on one manual is very thorough; the fullsoftware installation requires only a few steps, with very little userintervention.andP;  Although the installation may take a number of hours of clocktime, most of this does not require human attention.andM;As always, customers are responsible for normal UNIX system administrationfunctions.andP;  There are excellent system administration manuals to help withthese tasks.andP;  HP-UX is a System V derivative, so configuration andadministration is as easy (or as hard) as for any other UNIX system.andM;Although it is relatively expensive, the 835 hardware is no more difficult toinstall than that of any other system.andP;  Mounting the components in the mastersystem cabinet is easy; they cable together quickly, and are readilyaccessible once installed.andM;Support and DocumentationandM;We had no reason to call on Hewlett-Packard for support--the manuals wereaccurate and complete.andP;  The few quirks we ran into in running the system wereidentical to quirks we have seen on other HP systems.andP;  Prior experience withHP suggests that support is quite good overall, and that the company's staffis experienced enough to answer any tough questions that might come up.andM;Hewlett-Packard supplies customers with an excellent set of manuals.andP;  The useof examples is excellent, especially in the graphics manuals, and makes usingthe Starbase graphics package easy.andP;  All manuals come in their own binders,the production quality is excellent.andP;  The 835 manuals come in two sizes,8-1/2 x 11 inches and 7 x 8-1/2 inches.andP;  Some of the manuals are used withthe 9000/300 series, with differences between the RISC and Motorola processorversions noted very explicitly.andP;  Documentation is one of HP's strongpoints--it is the best that is available today.andM;Hardware support is readily available from HP as well.andP;  An on-sitemaintenance contract for the HP 835 costs $206 a month for the base systemwith 8 MB of RAM.andP;  This compares with $235 per month for a similarly-sizedSun-4/260 processor box.andP;  In general, monthly maintenance fees for theHewlett-Packard system are 10 to 25 percent less expensive than for aSun-4/260.andP;  Over the course of a three-year product lifetime, this differencefor a complete system amounts to several thousand dollars.andM;Operation and Ease of UseandM;The operating system is a port of UNIX System V with graphics and NFSnetworking enhancements.andP;  The system can be run in either scrolling mode(dumb terminal mode) or using X Windows Version 11.andP;  The default screen sizeis 128 characters by 49 lines, and the character set is very readable.andP;  Oneof the few problems we found (one we had already encountered in the 9000/300HP-UX) was an occasionally confused interaction between X Windows and the vieditor when window size was changed.andP;  In general, however the system actslike any other X Windows based product.andM;For graphics, either X Windows or Starbase graphics can be used, or Starbasegraphics can be run in the X Windows environment.andP;  In the latter mode,performance does suffer, however, so either Starbase or native X isrecommended.andM;Because of the power and size of the 835, user interaction is never aproblem.andP;  The system is very fast, the display is quite crisp, and then X11user interface is standard and complete.andP;  The system is very easy to use, andprovides a very pleasant working environment.andP;  The system integrated into ournetwork very easily, and all Hewlett-Packard software products worked asexpected.andM;As discussed in our earlier HP 9000/360 review, the only nonstandard part ofthe system is the HP proprietary-format cartridge tape drive.andP;  With theEthernet interface standard, other non-HP nodes in a network can be used toread any tapes in standard QIC-24 format that need to be transferred to theHP 835.andP;  We object to the proprietary tape drive only because it is differentfrom those of all other systems and requires a special cartridge tape.andM;The system reviewed had a battery backup power-fail unit.andP;  It was verycomforting to be able to pull the wall plug for the system, wait a fewminutes, plug the cord back in, and have the system recover.andP;  The ability toendure power failures without any damage to system files is worth the $5000cost of the battery backup.andM;In our testing, we did discover a few problems with the HP-UX software.andP;  Oneunusual problem we found was that, for certain combinations of the Starbasegraphics library, hardware, and drawing-routine calls (integer or devicecoordinates using the graphics accelerator drawing polygons), there is a lowlimit as to the number of sides that can be drawn in a polygon withoutgenerating an error from Starbase.andP;  This limit is much lower than when usingreal coordinates or drawing without the accelerator, and occurs with polygonshaving more than 20 sides.andM;PerformanceandM;The performance of the HP 9000/835 is one reason why the system sells for$80,000 or more.andP;  As the current high-end representative of theHewlett-Packard workstation line--it is substantially more expensive thanHP's 68K-based products, the 835 must necessarily exhibit performance higherthan that of other HP machines--and it does.andM;Figure 1 shows Dhrystone, Whetstone, and Linpack (MFLOPS) performance ratingsfor the HP 835 compared with six competitive systems.andP;  The Dhrystoneperformance of the 835 RISC processor is similar to that of the Mips RISCprocessor, and substantially higher than that of the other systems shown.andO;Across the other four floating-point benchmarks, the 835 is substantiallyfaster than the Sun-4/260, but not quite as fast as the Mips M/120-5.andP;  The128 KB cache on the HP 835 is the same as the cache on either the Sun-4/260or the Mips M/120-5, leading us to conclude that the HP RISC processor does avery creditable job.andM;Recently, there has been considerable discussion of the importance of RISC inthe workstation world.andP;  What is clear, at this point, is that at least someRISC processors hold a performance edge over the best of the 68K or 80386processors.andP;  This advantage is currently on the order of two (or more) timesbetter performance on Dhrystones, and three to four times better performanceon many floating-point tests.andP;  Using Weitek of other floating-pointprocessors on 80386 systems narrows this difference, but it is clear that,for the present, certain RISC processors, including the HP 835's, are fasterthan most competitively-priced CISC processors.andM;Figure 2 shows sequential transfer rates, in KB per second, for the HP9000/835 when reading the first 2 MB of an 8 MB file.andP;  The block size in thistest varies from 512 bytes to 8192 bytes.andP;  The 835 we reviewed used5-1/4-inch disk drives, and did quite well.andP;  The Sun-3/260 and 4/260 withwhich we compared the 835 had 8-inch ESMD disk drives.andP;  Only Mips machineshave a higher sequential read rate than the 835 while using 5-1/4-inch diskdrives, an advantage attributable in part to a slightly faster disk driveinterface, and a more intelligent operating system, but the HP 835 disksubsystem does quite well.andP;  Further, we found the performance of the diskdrive to be constant over all the block sizes we tested, so users should beable to achieve very good performance without running into unforeseenproblems if unusual block sizes are used.andM;Figure 3 shows similar data for random disk reads.andP;  Our tests read 2 MB ofdata from an 8 MB file by reading random blocks within the file.andP;  Again, welist data for four different block sizes, ranging from 512 bytes per block to8192 bytes per block.andP;  The HP 835 does particularly well on this test, easilyoutperforming a Sun-3/260 using an ESMD drive.andP;  While not quite as high asthat of a Sun-4/260 with ESMD drive, or of the Mips system, the random readdisk performance of the HP 835 is very impressive.andP;  Also, again, theperformance difference between the differing block sizes is relatively small(compared with the other systems) suggesting users will achieve goodperformance regardless of the block sizes used in their programs.andM;Unlike some newer versions of the UNIX operating system, HP-UX currently hasseparate disk buffers.andP;  If is not designed to allow all of memory to serve asthe disk buffer.andP;  This reduces overall file systemperformance somewhat,depending on the amount of memory available for tasks.andP;  If seems the currenttrend in the industry is to move away from dedicated disk buffers and towardthe &quot;all-of-memory&quot; approach, and Hewlett-Packard may move that way in thefuture.andP;  Until then, however, the way the system kernel is built duringsystem configuration determines the number of disk buffers allowed, makingkernel customization crucial for good performance on disk-intensiveapplications.andM;Figure 4 shows graphics performance data for the HP 835.andP;  Several differentgraphics libraries and hardware options are included.andP;  Hewlett-Packard'sStarbase library uses three types of parameters when performing figure calls.andO;Parameters may be either real (floating-point) numbers, integers, or actualdevice coordinates.andP;  These three data types, combined with the presence orabsence of the 2D integer graphics accelerator, lead to the six combinationsof Starbase graphics performance listed.andP;  In addition, Figure 4 shows X11performance and the performance of Starbase running under X11.andM;Our graphics test, Ghrafstone, measures 2D drawing rates.andP;  We draw 122different graphics figures, time each of the tests to determine drawingrates, and then calculate a weighted average of drawing rates for 12different graphics figures (such as filled squares or lines).andP;  Thus, thesingle Ghrafstone number represents a combined rate for common kinds ofprimitive drawing figures over a range of graphics figure sizes.andP;  If all ofthe 122 drawing rates (in graphics figures per second) were to double, thenthe Ghrafstone rate would also double.andP;  Thus, the difference between, say,2000 and 4000 Ghrafstones is an overall doubling of the graphics figuredrawing rates.andM;As shown in Figure 4, tests in Starbase under X run less than half as fast asthe same tests coded directly in X Windows.andP;  There is a three- to fourfoldpenalty for using Starbase under X instead of native Starbase graphics.andP;  Allthe native Starbase tests are 30 to 225 percent faster than those in X11.andO;The results of the six, Starbase tests lead us to some rather bizarreconclusions.andP;  The 2D integer graphics accelerator seems to improveperformance only when integer coordinates are used (this makes sense), butactually decreases performance when either real or device coordinates areused.andP;  The best performance is attained when device coordinates are used(this makes sense too), but graphics using real coordinates are displayedfaster than when integer coordinates are used.andM;This is the first time we have had a chance to compare, on one piece ofhardware, all the combinations shown in Figure 4.andP;  Using device coordinates,which are closely related to the physical pixel pattern of the displayhardware, provides a substantial and measurable performance increase.andP;  Forthe present, X11 is substantially slower than a proprietary (StarbaseGraphics Library) package, but course it is far more protable than Starbase,and its overall performance is reasonable.andP;  The 2D integer graphicsaccelerator produces some performance boost but should be used with cautionif integer coordinates in graphics library calls are not being used.andO;Interestingly, the 2D accelerator produces a substantial performance increasewhen several figures (such as filled and unfilled rectangles) are beingdrawn, but runs only half as fast as the non-accelerated test on otherdrawing functions (such as arcs).andP;  Thus, the 2D accelerator may or may not bevery useful, depending on the nature of the figure being drawn.andP;  This kind ofgraphics drawing rate relationship is also common on systems produced byother manufacturers.andM;Overall, the numbers shown in Figure 4 are pretty good.andP;  For comparison, seethe Ghrafstone scores of other systems in previous &quot;Tested Mettle&quot; columns(in Vol.andP;  6 No.andP;  11, for example).andP;  In general, values above 5000 areconsidered quite high, and values above 10,000 are about the highest we haveencountered.andP;  Values in the 2000 range are average for typical workstationstoday.andM;Figure 5 shows Workstation Laboratories' Khornerstone benchmark rating forseveral systems.andP;  The Khornerstone test yields a normalized numerical ratingof performance based on a mix of floating-point, processor, anddisk-intensive tests (21 in all), as well as another value representing thetotal time it takes to execute all the tests.andP;  As is shown, the HP 835 systemdoes quite well at 22,239 Khornerstones; it is competitive with the MipsM/120-5 system.andP;  Also shown in Figure 5 is rating for the HP 835 usingdefault operating system settings--15,062 Khornerstones.andP;  The higher numberwas obtained after expanding the size of the disk buffers in the kernel.andP;  Thekernel used for the higher Khornerstone value would be typical of that usedin a disk-intensive application.andM;When we examine a single ranking that includes all of the Khornerstoneratings that we have done to date, once again the performance of RISC systemspoints to a trend.andP;  We have not yet measured a non-RISC system available forunder $100,000 that has a Khornerstone rating of more than 14,000.andP;  Inaddition, nearly all the systems that score Khornerstone values above 10,000are RISC-based, and all the ones that rate 14,000 Khornerstones and above areRISC-based.andP;  While the Khornerstone test was modeled after a single-user loadon a system, it is clear that RISC systems really do provide a great deal ofcomputing power for the money.andM;Price/PerformanceandM;Our price/performance measure is determined by dividing the list price of asystem by its Khornerstone rating.andP;  Figure 6 shows the comparative resultsfor this test.andP;  At $4.01 per Khornerstone, the HP 835 rates better thanaverage for computer systems.andP;  In addition, in the performance range oftechnical workstations, its rating is clearly superior.andP;  Given theexpandability of the system and the level of performance it achieves, theprice/performance of the HP 835 is better than that of most other systems inits price or performance class.andM;As always, our caveats concerning these price/performance scores include thefact that they do not take into account graphics capabilities (or theirabsence) or performance in a network or multiuser environment.andP;  The rating isbased entirely upon, and therefore is only as valid as, the Khornerstone testitself.andP;  We rate the HP 9000/835's price/performance as &quot;good&quot; but, as wehave pointed out, in its performance class it is &quot;outstanding&quot;.andO;High-performance systems are still relatively more expensive thanlower-performance ones, but this difference for the HP 835 is slight.andO;Further, tuning of the system is application-specific and clearly affectsperformance.andP;  But there is no question that over a very broad range ofapplications--processor, floating-point, graphics, or disk-intensive--the HP835 is a very strong system.andM;Report CardandM;The report card for the HP 835 is very positive--the system is clearly a highachiever.andP;  Installation is about as easy as it could be.andP;  Documentation ratesan &quot;outstanding&quot;--it also is about as good as is available today from anymanufacturer.andP;  Support from Hewlett-Packard is also quite sufficient, in ourexperience.andP;  Overall, from a user standpoint, Hewlett-Packard is a verystrong contender in the workstation market because of its policy of attendingto all of the little details that go into selling and supporting a product.andO;HP has reached the mark other manufacturers should strive to achieve.andM;The HP 835 is expandable--it has many peripheral slots, lots of options, andnearly unlimited expansion capability through external card cages, buses, anda large bus in the base system.andP;  Although 96 MB of RAM may be a limitingfactor for some applications, it certainly covers most jobs a system likethis would be used for.andM;The operation of the system is graded &quot;good&quot;.andP;  It is a UNIX box and acts likeone.andP;  In addition, HP pays attention to industry standards and uses themintelligently.andP;  Hardware maintenance costs are more than competitive for asystem with the power of the 835.andP;  Ease of use also rates a &quot;good&quot;, given thetwo distinct working environments (X Windows or dumb terminal mode), twographics standards (X Windows or Starbase), and an easy-to-use keyboard andscreen.andP;  HP has added some of its own &quot;value&quot; in these are'as, so thepurchaser gets a little extra from each software product.andM;The 835's performance rates an &quot;outstanding&quot;--it is clearly astate-of-the-art-performance system.andP;  Although not as fast as the fastestRISC boxes (the Apollo DN10000 or Mips M/2000), as a workstation the systemis a very strong entry.andP;  At these levels of performance, individualapplications should be run on contending systems before a purchase ismade--no RISC system we have seen at this time is uniformly faster than otherRISC boxes, and the differences are very much program-dependent.andM;Price/performance rates as &quot;good&quot;--that is, better than most but not quite asgood as the top systems.andP;  Part of the difference between &quot;outstanding&quot; and&quot;good&quot; price/performance is due to the hardware associated with the graphicsdisplay and the expandability built into the system.andM;Overall, we give the Hewlett-Packard 9000/835 an &quot;outstanding&quot; rating.andP;  Evenwhen compared with all computer systems--not just workstations--the HP systemhas many strong points and very few areas that are not above average.andP;  In thefuture, systems of this kind will be less expensive and faster.andP;  For thepresent, though, Hewlett-Packard does an excellent job of balancing cost,performance, and ease of use.andP;  Its machines serve both as a model of thekinds of performance tomorrow's low-price workstations will display, and forwhat the high end of the workstation market is like today.andM;Its high price and superior performance notwithstanding, the HP 900/835 seemsto me about as friendly as today's personal computers.andP;  There is nothingintimidating about the machine.andP;  It is a pleasure to use, and Hewlett-Packardhas done an excellent job.andP;  The 835 is as good a workstation as any we havehad the pleasure to use to date.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
