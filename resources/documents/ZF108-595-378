highlights how littleandM;of OSI is in place...andM;Users are clamouring, and IBM has elaborated on its two year-old position onOpen Systems Interconnection (CI No 1,026) and says that this week'sannouncements provide future direction for customers planning their OSInetwork requirements.andP;  The areas addressed are OSI protocols included in SAACommon Communications Support; OSI in IBM's AIX Unix; SAA OSI support forwide area networks and local area networks; support for OSI Common ManagementInformation Services and OSI Common Management Information Protocols; OSIX500 Directory standard support; OSI support for worldwide profiles; OSIinteroperation and conformance testing; OfficeVision/VM and  OfficeVision/MVSsupport of OSI Message Hand ling System; TCP/IP to OSI transition direction and support; OSI-SNA integration; and Manufact uring Automation ProtocolVersion 3.0 support.andM;...Commits to FDDI - in two yearsandM;IBM says that over the next two years, it intends to offer Fibre DistributedData Interface local-area network products that conform to current andemerging ISO 9314 standards developed by the ANSI X3T9.5 committee.andP;  It alsoplans to offer FDDI workstation, host attachment and interconnections betweenFDDI, Token Ring, and Ethernet local area networks; to provide networkmanagement for FDDI; and offer an FDDI backbone local area network extensionincorporating single-mode optical fibre and laser technologies - fortransmission over significantly longer distances than with multi-mode opticalfibre and light-emitting diode technologies.andM;IBM bows to prevalence of EthernetandM;IBM has announced enhanced local area network products, said to givecustomers more flexibility in controlling their computer networks.andP;  IBM LocalArea Network Support Program Version 1.2 enables MS-DOS workstations onEthernet local area networks to communicate with each other and with OS/2workstations on a Token-Ring network.andP;  The Distributed Console AccessFacility Version 1.0 enables one workstation to be controlled by anotherworkstation and helps operators to administer departmental networks remotely.andO;Token-Ring Network 16/4 Trace and Performance Program and Adapters provide areal-time view of the traffic on a Token-Ring Network and send data at either4M-bits or 16M-bits per second.andP;  This enables customers to trace applicationuse, to collect data, and to perform capacity planning.andP;  Token-Ring NetworkBridge Program Version 2.2 connects two Token-Ring networks either locally orremotely over communications lines.andP;  It offers dial-up support for customersusing public switched telephone lines for remote links.andP;  The PersonalComputer Network Enhanced Extender and Personal Computer Network expand thedistance between baseband networks from 800 to 2,600 feet, and increase thepotential size of the network from 80 to 800 workstations.andP;  The bridgeenhancements enable baseband personal computer networks to communicate withToken-Ring networks.andP;  IBM also introduced the 7855 V.32 modem, which sendsdata at up to 19,200 bits per second, claimed to be up to eight times thetransmission speed of most personal computer modems.andP;  The LAN Support ProgramVersion 1.2 costs $66 for one copy and $44 for each additional copy.andP;  It willbe available on July 27, 1990.andP;  Prices for the Distributed Console AccessFacility are $135 for one copy, and $95 for additional copies.andP;  It will beavailable on November 30, 1990 in the US.andP;  The 16/4 Trace and PerformanceProgram costs $1,500 and is available on June 29, 1990.andP;  The Adaptor andAdaptor/A each cost $1,220 and are available from June 29, 1990.andP;  TheToken-Ring Network Bridge Program Version 2.2 costs $1,750 and upgrades fromVersions 2.0 and 2.1 cost $335.andP;  It will be available on September 28, 1990.andO;The 7855 V.32 Modem costs $1,350 from month-end.andM;TCP/IP for VM 2 brings string of Unix facilitiesandM;to the VM worldandM;TCP/IP Version 2 for VM enables VM users to participate in a multivendornetwork using the TCP/IP protocol set.andP;  The addition of Simple NetworkManagement Protocol support enables TCP/IP for VM Version 2 to communicatewith IBM's NetView network manager.andP;  This means it can act as a &quot;focal point&quot;for network management of TCP/IP networks and SNA NetView-managed networks.andO;The addition of Resource Access Control Facility support for the Network FileSystem server and Kerberos authentication enhance security.andP;  Otherenhancements include improvements to the socket library, the addition ofNetwork Computing System libraries, and an application development toolkitbased on OSF/Motif.andP;  Applications include the ability to send mail, transferfiles, log onto a remote host and act as a file server to network nodes.andP;  Thenetwork protocols supported are the Token-Ring, Ethernet, IEEE 802.3, DDNX25, PDN X25 and PC Network.andP;  Attachments to the host include the 3172Interconnect Controller and the 8232 LAN Channel Station, the 37XX line ofcommunications processors for X25 and SNA backbone transport, andHyperchannel support.andP;  Prices for TCP/IP Version 2 for VM range from $15,200to $35,840, and monthly charges range from $317 to $747, depending on thesize of the processor.andP;  The Network File System feature is priced separately,ranging between $3,040 to $7,165, and monthly charges between $63 to $149.andO;TCP/IP Version 2 for VM will be out on December 28 in the US.andM;Open Systems breach SNA stronghold with VTAM 3 OSIandM;Remote Programming InterfaceandM;Binding Open Systems Interconnection a little tighter into the previouslyclosed IBM networking world, a new VTAM Version 3 OSI Remote ProgrammingInterface Feature provides the same programming interface asOSI/Communications Subsystem.andP;  It enables an SNA system to run OSIapplications without installing OSI/Communications Subsystem on that system.andO;It also accesses another system running OSI/Communications Subsystem toenable multivendor OSI communications.andP;  The interface is an optional featureof VTAM Version 3 for MVS/ESA, VTAM Version 3 for MVS/XA, and VTAM Version 3for VM/SP.andP;  VTAM Version 3 for MVS/ESA and MVS/XA is available in the US atthe end of this month, and VM/SP is available from September 28, 1990.andP;  ForMVS/ESA, prices range between $17,000 and $40,000; for MVS/XA, between$11,000 and $31,000.andP;  It will be available on June 29, 1990 for both systems.andO;For VM/SP, the price starts at $1,855 and rises to $10,000; that's availableon September 28,1990.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
