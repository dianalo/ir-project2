Carroll</HL><DATE>09/25/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A8</SO><LP>   The first-ever World Scrabble Championship begins tomorrowin London, and leading the U.S. delegation will be a35-year-old who won a tense victory at the biggest U.S.tournament in Cincinnati last month. He happens to be myolder brother, Charles.   Chuck has come a long way. He had seemed normal as atoddler -- at least to our parents -- but our father got aninkling of what was in store when he asked five-year-oldChuck how he did on a test. Laconic even then, Chuck replied:&quot;Let's see. Four columns. Sixteen rows. Sixty-four questions.Missed one. Got 63 out of 64 right.&quot; By first grade, he washelping our babysitter with her algebra. By third grade, hewas doing our father's budgets for his part of Westinghouse'spublic-relations operation.</LP><TEXT>   In high school outside Pittsburgh and in college atCarnegie Mellon, Chuck earned full credentials as a math nerdand computer weenie, but the game of bridge had become hispassion. He, a partner and two innocent bystanders once drovetwo hours to a dog track, and the two partners discussed asingle bridge hand the entire trip. After betting for fourhours, Chuck and his partner resumed in mid-sentence anddiscussed the same hand the whole way back. Chuck became aLife Master, bridge's highest rank, at age 20 and finishedsecond in a national event. Then, in his mid-20s, he becamebored and dropped the game cold.   Rubik's Cube fascinated him briefly. During a lull as heand I toured New York some 10 years ago, I noticed he wasscribbling strings of numbers and letters on a scrap ofpaper. I finally figured out that he was trying tomathematically work through the cube's permutations.   Chuck soon moved on to gambling, quitting his job as acomputer programmer to move to Las Vegas for four months. Hemade money counting cards at blackjack and lightening thewallets of the drunk tourists at the poker table. But he lostmuch of the money by experimenting with systems for bettingon sports.   The interest in gambling ended abruptly, too, and Chuck,by now a manager for a computer company in Minneapolis, tookup Scrabble. His assault on the game began with somesimple-enough pointers: 1) Learn the 86 two-letter wordsbecause they let you connect to existing words; 2) Pay moreattention to what's on the board than what tiles are in yourrack; 3) Worry about what tiles you're stuck with after youplay a word. But most of his approach falls into thedon't-try-this-at-home-kids-because-this-is-for-professionals-realm.   Among other things, he has used a computer to generatelists of words that include seven of the letters he is mostlikely to find on his rack, plus one more letter. Chuckdrills himself on those words to keep them fresh in his mind.He plays Scrabble six hours or so a week and studies for morethan an hour a day. The image that endures of him is of thedutiful father strolling around his living room carrying ascreaming infant in a Snugli and studying his flashcards. Athis first nationals, in 1988, Chuck finished 16th. &quot;Lucky,&quot;he said. The next year, he slipped to 19th. &quot;Unlucky,&quot; heexplained. Last year, in his third try, he finished eighthand had clearly become a force in the game. When a friend ofour father's went to a tournament and asked a player to pointhim toward Chuck, he got the sort of stunned silence he wouldhave expected if he had wandered into a Little Italy socialclub and asked to see John Gotti.   This August, against the toughest field assembled inyears, Chuck was on a roll. Although the tournament didn'tcarry the imprimatur of Milton Bradley, Scrabble's owner, itdid include all the big names, such as Robert Felt, thereigning official champ because he won the 1990 nationaltournament.   In one game, Chuck's first three plays were &quot;bronzier,&quot;&quot;oracular&quot; and &quot;notturni,&quot; giving him three 50-point bonusesfor playing all seven letters in his rack. The score at thatpoint was 215 to 26. In another game, Chuck's opponent got50-point bonuses -- known as &quot;bingos&quot; -- on his first twoturns but found himself trailing Chuck by 190 points. Chuckhad scored a career-high 212 points on one word, &quot;landform,&quot;which hit two triple-word scores. Other games produced thewords &quot;zoeae,&quot; &quot;codeia,&quot; &quot;tirrivee,&quot; &quot;duvetyn,&quot; &quot;beigy&quot; and&quot;qaids&quot; (the latter, which according to the Official ScrabblePlayer's Dictionary means &quot;Far Eastern rulers,&quot; turns out tobe one of the most common plays in high-level Scrabble).   Nobody much watched the tournament, with its 160contestants huddled over their boards for 20 hours over 4 1/2days in the ballroom of a Cincinnati hotel. &quot;Too boring,&quot;Chuck said. But there was plenty of tension going into thefinal day's play, as Chuck's 18-6 record tied him with threeothers for first. He was ahead on the tiebreaker, the spreadbetween the points he had scored and the total his opponentshad scored, but he also was worried. He had to start offagainst Peter Morris, a former champion who Chuck describesas &quot;the smartest person who plays Scrabble.&quot;   Chuck played &quot;yclepe,&quot; which was a &quot;phony,&quot; or fake word,that looked like two Old English words. But Morris is agraduate student specializing in Victorian literature andcaught it right away. Chuck lost big after Morris challenged.When Chuck and Morris both won their next games, they werepitted against each other in the final game. Chuck not onlyhad to win, he had to win by 143 points to have the betterspread. &quot;A hundred-to-one shot,&quot; Chuck said.   But Chuck got both blanks in the final game and playedfour bingos, including &quot;klavern,&quot; a Ku Klux Klan cell. Thingsgot tight when Chuck drew the &quot;q&quot; right at the end withnowhere to play it, especially because Chuck describes Morrisas &quot;the best end-game player in the history of the world.&quot;Still, Chuck won by 152 points.   Chuck collected his check for $3,900 and celebrated bytaking the bus to Pittsburgh. He used the time to studywords. It's a good thing, since players at the worldchampionship will be able to use words from all officialEnglish-language Scrabble dictionaries, so Chuck had 20,000words to learn by this week.   ---   Mr. Carroll covers the computer industry for the Journalin New York.   910925-0103</TEXT></DOC>
