MillerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/05/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TWAAIRLINES (AIR) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Trans World Airlines announced a sweeping set of fare increases in response to soaring fuel costs.    TWA said it will tack on $3 to $7 on all domestic one-way tickets, and $8 on international tickets. The increases would be for tickets written as of June 19, just one month after the airline industry raised its discount fares by as much as 40%. Other fares weren't affected at that time.    Some analysts expressed skepticism over the carrier's plan, and even TWA said it may have to reconsider the increases if other airlines don't follow. The most important response will come from Texas Air Corp., the nation's largest airline. Texas Air could thwart TWA's move by declining to follow it, or it could make the move an industrywide standard by emulating it, analysts said.    Houston-based Texas Air and other major competitors all said they were studying TWA's move but haven't yet decided how they will respond.    Just two weeks ago Texas Air refused to follow when Allegis Corp.'s United Airlines, AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and TWA announced they planned modest increases in first class and full coach fares. Subsequently, those airlines abandoned the planned increase in most markets.    A spokesman for United said TWA's announcement &quot;reinforces our belief that fares must go up to offset rising fuel costs.&quot; The spokesman said United hasn't ruled out additional fare increases and is studying TWA's move.    Jet fuel prices rose more than 20% between November 1986 and April 1987, to 53 cents a gallon from 43.9 cents, TWA said. It said that rise added $1.3 billion to the industry's costs, a number that exceeded some analysts' estimates.    TWA packaged its increase in an unorthodox form: a surcharge that would vary according to a flight's distance. It compared the mechanism to pricing methods used by many electric utilities, and said it would raise or lower the surcharge as fuel prices fluctuate.    Under the plan, TWA would charge passengers $3 for one-way tickets for less than 500 miles, $5 for flights between 501 and 1,000 miles, and $7 for flights that exceed 1,001 miles. Passengers on international flights would have to pay an $8 surcharge.    The system departs from the way airlines generally set prices, which is based on the level of demand for each flight. Under the current system, well-traveled transcontinental routes often are cheaper than short but obscure routes.    TWA may have a difficult time sustaining its new pricing mechanism if air travel slows. Frantic discounting could then overwhelm any effort to fine-tune a fuel surcharge.    &quot;I think there's going to be a great deal of skepticism as to whether it's actually going to work,&quot; said John Pincavage, an airline analyst at PaineWebber Inc. &quot;When times are tough, people discount and they don't worry about whether fuel's going up or not.&quot; Air traffic has been strong in recent months, rising 10% to 15% over year-earlier levels.    TWA said its advertised fares won't rise to reflect the new surcharges. It said the surcharges will be explained at the bottom of its advertisements.    TWA stock registered modest gains yesterday in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $27.75 a share, up 50 cents.    Under its chairman, Carl C. Icahn, who won control of the airline two years ago, TWA has been pulling itself out of a mire of red ink. In the first quarter, it narrowed its net loss to $54.8 million from $169.6 million. This year Mr. Icahn has said he expects the company to outstrip its record net income of $83 million. </TEXT></DOC>
