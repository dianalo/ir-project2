It is shown that the muon method in the zero externalfield can be applied for measuring domain structure and the other magneticproperties of ferromagnetics. Experimental accuracy in these measurementscan be sufficiently high which allows one to study the effect of differentfactors (compression, annealing, coating) on the mutual magnetic properties.7 refs.; 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
