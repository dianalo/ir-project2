Korean news reports Thursday had claimed the U.S. agreedto drop South Korea from the list of unfair traders if Seouljoins the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's governmentprocurement code. These are international rules that governgovernment purchases of imported goods. But a U.S. official,in Seoul for several days of trade talks, said that no suchpromise had been made. She said that President Bush will makethat decision based on recommendations from variousgovernment departments and agencies.</LP><TEXT>   The 1988 U.S. Trade Act requires the president to list byApril 30 each year those countries practicing unfair trade.South Korea is the fourth largest supplier of goods to theU.S. government, but doesn't have clear rules on buyingimported goods for government use. &quot;While we were encouragedby the information we heard,&quot; the Washington official said,&quot;no one piece of information will determine the outcome.&quot;   Even acceptance of the GATT government procurement codewon't necessarily end disagreements on government purchasesof U.S. products. Japan was an early signatory to the codeand the U.S. still faces significant Japanese reluctance tobuy U.S. goods.   The trade negotiators also discussed a host of otherissues, including implementation of prior agreements.&quot;Generally speaking, we are pleased with the way theagreements are being implemented,&quot; said a U.S. official, whoasked not to be identified. &quot;There are minor problems, butthat is always the case.&quot;   The trade officials also are preparing final adjustmentsto a trade agreement on U.S. beef imports into Korea. Theagreement was worked out in Washington last month and a U.S.official said the agreement could be signed next week.   The working-level officials also established an officialgroup to review technical regulations for food safety thataffect agricultural imports by both nations. There have beennumerous tiffs between the two countries on imported productsthat may or may not have carried harmful pesticides.Officials agreed to postpone discussions ontelecommunications disputes.   The South Korean government also presented complaints tothe U.S., including its claims that American tobaccocompanies market their products unfairly and that U.S.regulations for imported fruit aren't clear.</TEXT></DOC>
