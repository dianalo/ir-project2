Subchapter T, consistingof Parts 175 through 187, contains the regulations governing the inspectionand certification of small passenger vessels. A small passenger vesselis defined by Title 46, United States Code, Section 2101 as a vessel ofless than 100 gross tons carrying more than six passengers. The approximately4800 vessels which are categorized as small passenger vessels comprisethe largest category of commercial vessels subject to inspection in theUnited States. Both the Coast Guard and the small passenger vessel industry have realizedthe need for and the importance of revising the regulations contained inSubchapter T for several years. The last major revision of the subchapterwas made in 1963. The Coast Guard has made numerous minor revisions tothe regulations since that time, but those revisions have not been sufficientto keep abreast of the many changes affecting the small passenger vesselfleet in the last 20 years. Although the Coast Guard has periodically reviewed the regulations in SubchapterT in the past, the present effort to revise the regulations was initiatedin 1982, and a regulatory docket was established in 1985. Alternativesto a complete revision of Subchapter T were considered. First, the CoastGuard could continue to use the existing regulations. However, becausethe regulations are outdated, it is necessary to extensively use informalpolicy. This situation is unsatisfactory since not everyone building andoperating small passenger vessel is aware of such policy. Second, individualproblems, such as those caused by statutory changes, could be correctedby separate regulatory projects under individual dockets. However, theprocess to completely make all the necessary changes on an individual basiswould be unnecessarily duplicative, more lengthy, and result in more inconsistenciesthan a complete revision. Therefore, the Coast Guard is proposing to revise the entire SubchapterT at this time. Proposed regulations for Parts 175 to 185, which includeinspection, certification, design, and equipment requirements, are containedin this notice. Proposed revisions of the manning regulations for smallpassenger vessels are being developed separately under docket CGD 85-080Abut in coordination with this project. As part of this proposal to revise Subchapter T, the Coast Guard is alsoproposing to revise portions of 46 CFR Subchapter S, Subdivision and Stability,which affect small passenger vessels. Parts 170, 171, and 173 of SubchapterS are proposed to be revised. A regulatory information number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory actionlisted in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations. The Regulatory InformationService Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of eachyear. The RIN number contained in the heading of this document can be usedto cross reference this action with the Unified Agenda.<ITAG tagnum="84">Requests For Comments </ITAG>Interested persons are invited and encouraged to participate in this proposedrulemaking by submitting written views, data, or arguments. As discussedlater in this preamble, the Coast Guard considered input from many sourcesto develop proposed regulations which would best address both the safetyand operational needs of small passenger vessels. However, due to the varietyof vessels that comprise the small passenger vessel fleet and their variousneeds, it is difficult to adequately address all situations and analyzethe effect the proposed regulations would have on all vessels. Consequently,the Coast Guard seeks input on all aspects of the proposed regulationsfrom vessel owners, operators, architects, and builders, and from consumers,equipment and material vendors, insurers, surveyors, and other personsinvolved with small passenger vessels. Comments concerning the proposedregulations, including additional costs they may impose upon the smallpassenger vessel industry, are requested. Persons submitting comments should include their name and address, referencethis notice (CGD 85-080), give the specific section of the proposed regulationsto which each comment applies, and include supporting documents or sufficientdetail to indicate the reason for each comment. Persons desiring an acknowledgmentthat their comments were received should include a stamped, self-addressedenvelope or postcard. This proposal may be changed in light of the commentsreceived. All comments received before the expiration of the comment periodwill be considered before final action is taken on this proposal. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Hearings </ITAG>The Coast Guard plans to hold public hearings on this rulemaking in Washington,DC, New Orleans, LA, and San Francisco, CA. Hearings may be held in otherlocations if requested in writing by interested persons who can demonstratethat other opportunities to make an oral presentation will aid this rulemaking.Comments on hearings on this rulemaking must be received prior to March1, 1989. Details of the times, dates, and locations of hearings will bepublished in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4><ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal persons involved in the drafting of this proposal are LCDRWilliam P. Cummins, Project Manager, LCDR Mark G. VanHaverbeke, ProjectAnalyst, Office of Merchant Marine Safety, Security, and EnvironmentalProtection, and CDR Gerald A. Gallion, Project Attorney, Office of ChiefCounsel. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>History of Regulations The regulations in Subchapter T were initially developed in the late 1950'sas an outgrowth of the booming boating industry and the recognized needfor improved safety aboard small passenger vessels. During 1951 the motorboatsJACK and PELICAN were lost resulting in 11 and 45 deaths, respectively.Investigations into the accidents concluded that if such vessels were requiredby law to be inspected for certification the JACK would not have been certificateddue to its poor material condition and the PELICAN would have been limitedto carrying about 30 persons (there were 62 persons aboard at the timeof the accident). These and other accidents prompted Congress to pass the``Small Passenger Vessel Act'' of 1956 (Pub. L. 84-519) requiring the inspectionand certification of vessels of 65 feet or less in length, measuring morethan 15 but less than 100 gross tons, and carrying more than 6 passengers.Public Law 84-519 was codified in the United States Code in 46 U.S.C. 390.Under the authority of the Secretary of Treasury, the U.S Coast Guard wasdirected to develop regulations to carry out the law. The initial regulationsapplicable to small passenger vessels subject to Pub. L. 84-519 were promulgatedin Title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, Subchapter T, in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of October 5, 1957 (22 FR 7949). The initialregulations took effect on June l, 1958. Based on experience gained withthe initial inspection and certification of more than 4,000 small passengervessels, significant changes were made to Subchapter T on September 29,1960, as published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(25 FR 9315). In 1963 the scope of the regulations in Subchapter T was broadened to includevessels of more than 65 feet in length, measuring less than 100 gross tons,and carrying one or more passengers (28 FR 9733). Such vessels were requiredto be inspected and certificated annually under the authority of 46 U.S.C.404. By including these small vessels under Subchapter T the need for referencingseveral subchapters when determining the applicable requirements for thesesmall vessels was eliminated, and the regulations for all small passengervessels were grouped into one subchapter. The grouping of two classes of small passenger vessels with different inspectionauthorities, 46 U.S.C. 390 and 46 U.S.C 404, under one set of inspectionregulations resulted in the Coast Guard establishing two statutorily recognizedcategories of vessels within Subchapter T. The division was necessary becauseof differences in the inspection laws governing the two categories of smallpassenger vessels. Although the governing laws have changed, the distinctionbetween the two categories remains in Subchapter T today. The two categoriesare T-S vessels, which include small passenger vessels of not more than65 feet in length carrying more than 6 passengers, and T-L vessels, whichinclude those of more than 65 feet in length carrying one or more passengers.Although many of the requirements are the same, Subchapter T contains manydiffering requirements for each vessel category, reflecting vessel size,potential passenger carrying capacity, and operating conditions. Due tooriginal differences in 46 U.S.C. 390 and 46 U.S.C 404, T-S vessels areissued a Certificate of Inspection (COI) valid for three years followingcompletion of a triennial inspection, while T-L vessels are issued a COIvalid for one year following an annual inspection. Additionally, a T-Svessel is required to undergo two annual reinspections during the lifeof its COI. Public Law 84-519 intended that the regulations promulgated thereunderprovide a standard of safety for weekend fishermen on party fishing boats,sightseers on small excursion boats, and possibly small ferries. The vesselsto be regulated were of various designs, often principally owned by individualsor families, and normally operated on a tight budget. They usually operatedout of a single port and, for the most part, would be inspected and certificatedby a single Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI). In an attemptto equitably regulate such a diverse group of vessels, many having operatedsafely for years, the Coast Guard developed regulations which were flexible.They were purposely written so that local peculiarities and differing typesof vessels and operations could be equitably accounted for by the localOCMI when applying the regulations. For the most part, the regulationshad different requirements for each vessel type, reflecting vessel size,potential passenger carrying capacity, and potential operating conditions.The regulations gave the local Officers in Charge, Marine Inspection, agreat deal of discretion to set the safety standards for small passengervessels built and operated in their zones. This was in recognition of thesmall size and limited operating areas of most small passenger vessels.Since the OCMI had knowledge of local operating conditions, such as weatherand sea conditions, the availability of harbors of safe refuge, searchand rescue facilities, and other specialized local knowledge, the regulationswere structured to give the OCMI maximum flexibility to set standards thatwere appropriate to the prevalent conditions. The OCMI decided which ofthe local factors impacted upon vessel operations and safety, and thenset appropriate standards as allowed by the regulations. Several minor revisions have been made to Subchapter T since it underwentits last major revision in 1963. However, the minor revisions have notkept abreast of the numerous changes which have occurred affecting thesmall passenger vessel fleet since the early 1960's. The regulations generallyremain satisfactory for the type of vessels that they were initially writtenfor, including party fishing boats, small excursion boats, and small ferries.However, numerous other types of small passenger vessels are now regulatedby Subchapter T including large overnight cruise vessels, very large excursionvessels, dynamically supported craft, and vessels which may operate inseveral Coast Guard marine inspection zones throughout the year. In addition,both statutory changes and technological advances have affected the construction,equipping, and operation of small passenger vessels. Small Passenger Vessel Fleet Statistics in this section show the large number and variety of vesselswhich presently comprise the small passenger vessel fleet. The large numberand variety both contribute to the need to revise Subchapter T and complicatethe revision process. Most of the statistics in this section and throughoutthe preamble were obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety InformationSystem (MSIS) in late 1987. Information from the MSIS was also used incompleting the regulatory evaluation. The service of small passenger vessels currently operating includes ferries,excursion boats used for sightseeing and dinner cruises, overnight cruiseboats, party fishing (head) boats, charter fishing boats, dive boats, crewboats for the offshore oil industry many of which also carry freight, passengerbarges, and submersibles. Small passenger vessels are now propelled bya variety of means including: Diesel engines; gasoline inboard, inboard/outboard,and outboard motors; electric motors; cable pull; mule tow; sail; and steamengines. An MSIS data capture in July, 1987 indicated there were 4744 vessels certificatedunder Subchapter T. Of the 4744 vessels, 3657 were classed as T-S vessels,i.e., of not more than 65 feet in length, and 1087 were T-L vessels, i.e.,of more than 65 feet in length. Twenty-two vessels were greater than 150feet in length. Eleven hundred thirty-three vessels were certificated with oceans routes,1553 with coastwise routes, 1083 with lakes, bays, and sounds routes, and975 with Great Lakes or rivers routes. The maximum number of passengers that small passenger vessels are permittedto carry varies from 7 to over 1300. The passenger carrying capacity ofthe total small passenger vessel fleet is 303,000. Fifty percent of the existing small passenger vessel fleet has been builtsince 1970. Approximately 185 new vessels have entered the small passengervessel fleet every year since that date. Reason for Revision The following events, which have occurred since the initial promulgationof the regulations, necessitate a complete revision of Subchapter T. 1. <T3>Statutory Changes. </T3>Subchapter T needs to be revised to reflectthe statutory changes originally made by Pub. L. 96-378 and now codifiedin Title 46 of the U.S. Code. This change placed all vessels measuringless than 100 gross tons carrying more than 6 passengers under the inspectionauthority of a single statute, 46 U.S.C. 390. Section 390 was subsequentlyrepealed by Pub. L. 98-89 of August 26, 1983. Pub. L. 98-89 revised, consolidated,and enacted certain laws related to vessels and seamen as Subtitle II ofTitle 46, United States Code, ``Shipping.'' The authority for the inspectionand certification of small passenger vessels was relocated to and is nowfound in 46 U.S.C. 3301(8). As a result of the changes originally made by Pub. L. 96-378, there isno longer a statutory authority separating small passenger vessels intotwo categories. However, the T-S and T-L categories still exist in SubchapterT. Additionally, the T-L vessel designation in Subchapter T is now incorrectin that it still classifies a vessel carrying one or more passengers asa small passenger vessel while the law states that the criterion is morethan six passengers. 2. <T3>Increase in Vessel Size and Capacity. </T3>Another reason for modifyingSubchapter T is so that it will better reflect the needs of the increasinglylarger physical size of small passenger vessels. A review of the data onsmall passenger vessels indicates a general trend toward larger vessels.In 1964, the first year that statistics were available which separatedsmall passenger vessels by T-S and T-L categories, there were 3809 smallpassenger vessels. Of these, 175 or 4.6%, were classified as T-L vessels.As of July 30, 1987, the number of T-L vessels had risen to 1087 vessels,or 24% of the total number of small passenger  vessels.  While  the  T-S and T-L categories primarily reflect a vessel's length, T-L vessels alsogenerally have a greater passenger capacity than T-S vessels. In addition, there is an increasing number of vessels characterized as``very large'' small passenger vessels by the U.S. Coast Guard Navigationand Vessel Inspection Circular No. 11-83 (NVIC 11-83). Such vessels areunder 100 gross tons yet are of more than 79 feet in length. There arenow approximately 840 small passenger vessels of more than 79 feet in length,including some that are of more than 200 feet in length and carry morethan 1000 passengers. NVIC 11-83 discusses such ``very large'' small passenger vessels that haveovernight accommodations for more than 50 passengers. The hazards involvedwith the operation of these large overnight cruise vessels are differentthan those faced by most small passenger vessels. There are now about 18vessels of this type. One ``very large'' small passenger vessel, whichwas recently certificated, is of more than 240 feet in length and carries128 overnight passengers. A primary reason for the vast increase in the number of T-L vessels, especially``very large'' small passenger vessels, has been the development and increaseduse of various design innovations. These innovations result in the grosstonnage of a vessel being less than that of a passenger vessel of comparablesize which would have to be inspected under 46 CFR Subchapter H (PassengerVessels). Subchapter H contains the regulations for the inspection andcertification of vessels of at least 100 gross tons carrying passengers.Boat builders are gaining more expertise in the use of the various exemptions,reductions, and other devices which are used in the basic tonnage formulato lower gross tonnage. The use of these innovations is not only to placea vessel under the inspection standards of Subchapter T, which are in mostinstances significantly less stringent than the standards of SubchapterH, but also to allow the vessel to be manned with the lesser crew complementpermitted on small passenger vessels.The existing regulations in Subchapter T were not developed consideringthe hazards and risks associated with the operation of these ``very large''small passenger vessels. Compliance with the existing regulations in SubchapterT alone does not provide an adequate level of safety from the hazards andrisks caused by the physical size, passenger capacity, and operations of``very large'' small passenger vessels. 3. <T3>Changing Scope of Operation. </T3>While vessels have been getting larger,their trades have also often changed. Public Law 84-519 intended that theregulations promulgated thereunder provide a standard of safety for weekendfishermen, sightseers, and possibly small ferries. The vessels to be regulatedprincipally operated out of a single port and, for the most part, wereinspected and certificated by a single OCMI. Most of the vessels continuedto operate in the marine inspection zone where their original inspectionfor certification was completed. Because of the very localized nature ofmost small passenger vessels when the regulations were initially developed,the regulations were intentionally made flexible. They were purposely writtenin this manner so that local peculiarities and different types of vesselsand operations could be equitably accounted for by local officials whenapplying the regulations. However, the environment in which small passenger vessels operate has changeddramatically. A sizeable number of these vessels no longer operate outof one port, especially those in seasonal passenger trades, and local considerationsare of less importance to most of these operations. Vessels built for operationin one OCMI zone or for a particular type of operation, are for variousreasons changing operations and operating in other OCMI zones or othertrades. There are now also more small passenger vessels engaged in internationalvoyages which are required to comply with the International Conventionfor Safety of Life at Sea. Because of the changing scope of operations, the flexibility built intothe original regulations now often causes inconsistencies. The standardsapplied in one port are not the same as those applied in another; eventhe standards within a marine inspection zone vary as OCMIs change. TheCoast Guard's ability to consistently apply and enforce the regulationswill be enhanced by development of a single set of standards more applicableto all small passenger vessels. 4. <T3>Technological Advances. </T3>Subchapter T does not presently addressmany technological advances which have occurred since the regulations wereinitially promulgated. Such advances have helped improve the operationalcapability and safety of a vessel. Examples include improvements in fireprotection equipment such as Halon systems and the development and provenuse of smoke detectors, gasoline vapor detectors, bilge level alarms, andimproved electrical cable insulations. Industry has responded to many recentadvances by developing industrial standards and codes, not presently addressedin Subchapter T, which will help ensure uniform and safe design, construction,and installation of equipment and materials used aboard small passengervessels. There has also been a significant cost reduction in many typesof equipment due to technological advances and increased use of such equipmentincluding Halon fire extinguishing systems, radar, LORAN, and inflatableliferafts. A piece of equipment, such as LORAN, was prohibitively moreexpensive and more difficult to use several years ago than today. The regulationsneed to be revised to reflect these technological changes by, in some cases,allowing the use of certain equipment now prohibited and, in other cases,requiring the installation of equipment not previously available or feasibleto install on a small passenger vessel. 5. <T3>Development in Hull Materials and Vessel Designs. </T3>The use of fiberreinforced plastic (FRP) and aluminum has significantly increased in thelast 25 years. Approximately 16 percent of all small passenger vesselsnow have FRP hulls and 21 percent have aluminum hulls. Of the vessels builtwithin the last three years, 29 percent have FRP hulls and 26 percent havealuminum hulls. When the regulations were initially promulgated, almostall small passenger vessels were built completely of steel or wood. Additionally, the present regulations do not appropriately address theunique design and operating characteristics and capabilities of many vesselswhich twenty years ago were considered novel craft but which have becomemuch more common and accepted. Included among these vessels are dynamicallysupported craft (DSC) such as hydrofoils, air cushion vessels, and surfaceeffect ships. Certain high speed planing and semi-planing vessels may alsobe considered DSC. Presently, the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety InformationSystem lists 4 hydrofoils, 1 air cushion vessel, and 5 surface effect shipsas certificated small passenger vessels. Additionally, there are approximately130 multihull vessels certificated as small passenger vessels, of which25 may be dynamically supported when underway due to their speed capabilityand size. The number of such vessels used to carry passengers is expectedto greatly increase in the future. Since Subchapter T was written primarily for displacement hulls, it isdifficult to apply many areas of the existing regulations to DSC. Buildersand owners have increasingly asked the Coast Guard to accept the designof DSC under the equivalency provision of existing 46 CFR 175.15 on thebasis that particular equipment, apparatus, or arrangements required bySubchapter T are unreasonable or impracticable for a DSC. In each case,the parties requesting Coast Guard approval of design or equipment arerequired to demonstrate that proposed alternatives would provide a degreeof safety that meets or exceeds the minimum standards in Subchapter T.Such equivalencies are usually based on compliance with the InternationalMaritime Organization's ``Code of Safety for Dynamically Supported Craft''(DSC Code), as well as classification, society rules and DSC standardsof other governments. Because DSC are not specifically addressed in SubchapterT, the inconvenience of demonstrating equivalency is an increasingly burdensometask for industry and the Coast Guard. For this reason, and because DSCare no longer considered novel craft due to their wide acceptance and increasingnumber, Subchapter T should be revised to specifically address dynamicallysupported craft.6. <T3>Vessel Casualties. </T3>Following investigations of numerous casualtiesinvolving inspected small passenger vessels, the National TransportationSafety Board (NTSB) and Coast Guard investigators have recommended manyrevisions to the existing regulations in Subchapter T which they believewould help prevent casualties or alleviate damages and injuries from futurecasualties. The Coast Guard agrees with many of the investigation recommendationsthat have been made. A study of the existing regulations, National TransportationSafety Board reports, and Coast Guard vessel casualty reports reveals thatthe existing regulations do not provide an appropriate level of protectionfrom the safety hazards and risks that many small passenger vessels aresubject to today. The primary areas of concern are lifesaving equipment,fire protection standards, manning, and vessel operations. <T3>Casualty Data. </T3>As part of the project to revise Subchapter T,data on casualties involving small passenger vessels was reviewed lookingfor the repeated occurrence of certain types of casualties which may havebeen mitigated by changes in the regulations. The casualty informationpresented below is a summary of the data for inspected small passengervessels from 1981 through 1986. This six year period is used because theCoast Guard's Commercial Casualty Data Base and the Personnel CasualtyData Base, from which the information was obtained, were first used in1981. These systems provide more reliable casualty information than availablefrom data systems used in previous years. The casualty figures which followreflect reported casualties over the six year period with interpolationnecessary in some cases. Their accuracy may be affected by the failureto report some casualties. The data presented only includes marine casualties which are required tobe reported to the Coast Guard by 46 U.S.C. 6101 and 46 CFR 4.05-1 of SubchapterT. Casualties must be reported to the Coast Guard if they involve groundings,loss of maneuvering capability, an occurrence affecting the seaworthinessof a vessel, a loss of life, injury causing incapacitation for more than72 hours, or any casualty resulting in more than $25,000 in property damage.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s150,10,10,10 </C>1981-1986 <T4>Small Passenger Vessel Casualties </T4><H1>Nature </H1><H1>Number of casualties </H1><H1>Deaths </H1><H1>Injuries</H1> Casualties involving total loss of a vessel with accompanying deaths andinjuries: <ITAG tagnum="3">Collision </ITAG><D>9 </D><D>1 </D><D>2 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Sank/Broke Up/Fire (while moored) </ITAG><D>8 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Explosion/Fire (other than while moored) </ITAG><D>8 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Flooding/Foundering (8 had wood hulls) </ITAG><D>11 </D><D>9 </D><D>4 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Capsizing </ITAG><D>4 </D><D>0 </D><D>3 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Unknown </ITAG><D>2 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Grounding </ITAG><D>2 </D><D>3 </D><D>0</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>44 </D><D>13 </D><D>9</D><R>n,dandCx.3;</R></ITAG>Casualties materially affecting a vessel (including total loss) with accompanyingdeaths and injuries: <ITAG tagnum="3">Collision </ITAG><D>156 </D><D>2 </D><D>57 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Explosion/Fire </ITAG><D>74 </D><D>0 </D><D>11 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Capsizing/Foundering/Flooding/Swamping </ITAG><D>128 </D><D>13 </D><D>11 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Grounding </ITAG><D>182 </D><D>1 </D><D>9 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Material failure_to machinery, structure, control and navigating systems</ITAG><D>248 </D><D>1 </D><D>5 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Steering </ITAG><D>43 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Disabled </ITAG><D>34 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Other </ITAG><D>42 </D><D>6 </D><D>0</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>907 </D><D>23 </D><D>94</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s10,8 </C>1981-1986 <T4>Total Deaths Involving Small Passenger Vessels </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Includes deaths from casualties materially affecting a vessel] </ITAG><H1>Nature </H1><H1>Number</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Diving accident involving person transported to dive site by smallpassenger vessel <D>39 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fall into water <D>29 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Suffocation <D>12 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Disappearance <D>5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Natural cause <D>5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Other (incl. falls on board, burns, falling objects, crushed) <D>22</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>112</D></ITAG></ITAG> <T3>Significant Casualties. </T3>Several casualties have occurred in thepast twenty years which individually have had a significant impact on thisproposal. A large number of lives were lost or put at risk during thosecasualties, or extensive property damage occurred. The NTSB, Coast GuardMarine Boards of Investigation, and/or individual Coast Guard investigatorsmade recommendations which impact this proposal. A summary of some of thecasualties, which resulted in recommendations that were considered in developingproposed changes to Subchapter T, follows. Unless otherwise stated, allthe vessels cited were inspected small passenger vessels. COMET. The COMET was a 48 foot, 15 gross ton, party fishing boat. At 8:00a.m. on May 19, 1973, the vessel foundered and sank in heavy seas off PointJudith Harbor, Rhode Island. The water temperature was 48 anddegrees;F. Ofthe 27 persons on board, 11 were rescued, 12 drowned, and 4 are missing.The COMET was not inspected by the Coast Guard at the time of the casualtyalthough it was required to have been. DIXIE LEE II. The DIXIE LEE II was a 42 foot, 19 gross ton, charter fishingvessel. At 4:25 p.m. on June 6, 1977, the vessel capsized during a sudden,severe thunderstorm. Of the 27 persons on board, 14 persons were rescued,12 persons died, and 1 is missing. The vessel suffered only minor damage,was refloated, and returned to service. FANTASY ISLANDER. The FANTASY ISLANDER was a 42 foot, 14 gross ton, woodenvessel. At 3:45 p.m. on September 4, 1984, the vessel caught on fire onPeace River, Punta Gorda, Florida. The 37 persons aboard entered the waterand were rescued by boats in the vicinity. There were no injuries but thevessel was totally destroyed. FINALISTA 100. The FINALISTA 100 was an 84 foot, 96 gross tons, woodenhull vessel. At 4:00 a.m. on October 23, 1982, the vessel burned and sankwhile operating 37 miles southwest of Point Buchon, California after afire started in the vessel's machinery space. The water temperature was50 anddegrees;F to 60 anddegrees;F. All 43 persons on board were saved. FISH-N-FOOL. The FISH-N-FOOL was a 55 foot, 69 gross ton, chartered fishingvessel.

The water temperature was 53 anddegrees;F.Of the 22 persons on board, 6 persons drowned and 2 are missing. Propertyloss was estimated at $20,000. MERRY JANE. The MERRY JANE was a 64 foot, 68 gross ton, charter fishingboat. At 4:11 a.m. on February 8, 1986, while the vessel was approachingBodega Bay, California, the vessel was broached and heeled sharply to starboardresulting in 19 of of the 51 persons onboard being thrown or falling intothe water. Nine of those persons drowned and one is missing. PEARL C. The PEARL C. was a 31 foot, 14 gross ton, charter fishing vessel.At 8:51 p.m. on September 13, 1976, the vessel capsized while being towedacross the Columbia River Bar, near Astoria, Oregon. Of the 10 personsaboard, 2 persons were rescued, 1 person drowned, and 7 persons are missing.The vessel was a total loss.PILGRIM BELLE. The PILGRIM BELLE was a 192 foot, 96 gross ton, vessel withovernight accommodations for 104 passengers and 25 crew members. It wascertificated for a lakes, bays, and sounds route along the east coast ofthe United States and coastwise along the New Jersey shore. At 4:20 p.m.on July 28, 1985, the vessel ran aground in Vineyard Sound, Massachusetts.One hundred persons were evacuated directly onto other vessels in the area.No deaths or injuries occurred. $357,000 in property damage occurred. SAN MATEO. The SAN MATEO was a 46 foot, 14 gross ton, charter fishing vessel.At 10:00 a.m. on February 16, 1983, the vessel capsized while crossinga bar at the entrance to Morro Bay Harbor, California. All 32 persons onboard were thrown into the water. Three persons were seriously injured.All persons were quickly rescued by nearby harbor patrol and Coast Guardvessels. The vessel was destroyed. YANKEE. The YANKEE is a 136 foot, 425 gross tons, passenger vessel, inspectedunder Subchapter H, which is permitted to operate on lakes, bays, and sounds.The Yankee is similar in physical size to many ``very large'' small passengervessels with overnight accommodations. At 3:53 p.m. on July 2, 1983, theYANKEE collided with a Liberian freight ship, the HARBEL TAPPER, in densefog in Rhode Island Sound. Two of the Yankee's 139 passengers were injured.The YANKEE sustained $26,000 in damages and was temporarily out of service.The HARBEL TAPPER, an 8,000 gross ton ship, sustained $25,000 in damages.7. <T3>Reference Changes. </T3>During the past twenty-five years, many referencescited in the existing regulations have changed. New publications have supersededthe original publications and, in some cases, new standards have been developed.The existing references need to be updated and the addresses for listedorganizations corrected. Additionally, several industry standards existwhich may be suitable for incorporation by reference into the regulations.In some cases, industry standards are more current and better suited forparticular types of vessels than existing regulations. 8. <T3>Extensive Policy Guidance. </T3>For many of the same reasons that SubchapterT needs to be revised, the Coast Guard has issued a myriad of policy decisionsat the local, district, and headquarters level on the technical interpretationand enforcement of Subchapter T. The policies have been promulgated inNavigation and Vessel Inspection Circulars (NVICs), the Coast Guard MarineSafety Manual, policy file memos from the Commandant (G-MTH), and letters.Differences in local policies have created many inconsistencies among inspectionzones. Local policy determination, while acceptable in 1958, creates inconsistenciesand economic hardship when a vessel built in one marine inspection zone,operates during the summer in another zone, and spends the winter seasonin a third zone. Additionally, differences in local standards may put abuilder in one zone at an economic disadvantage when bidding against abuilder in another zone which has a different policy.<ITAG tagnum="85">Development of Proposed Regulations </ITAG>In developing the proposed regulations the laws governing small passengervessels, Coast Guard policy on enforcement of the existing regulations,and recommendations stemming from casualty investigations were considered.Additionally, comments on and suggested revisions to the existing regulationsmade by Coast Guard field units and individuals and organizations involvedin the small passenger vessel industry were evaluated. Coast Guard Field Input Since the initial promulgation of Subchapter T, Coast Guard district offices,marine safety offices, and marine inspection offices have periodicallyrecommended revising various requirements of the small passenger vesselregulations. Field units submitted recommendations to the Commandant usuallybased on specific problems they were experiencing with the application,adequacy, or burden of particular requirements to vessels within theirlocal inspection zones. Numerous comments were also submitted when, in1982, the Commandant initiated a review of Subchapter T by soliciting recommendedchanges to the regulations from field units. Industry Input Owners and managing operators of small passenger vessels have providedindirect input to this proposed rulemaking through the numerous requestsfor equivalents and appeals of requirements made under the existing andSection;andSection;175.15-1 and 175.30-15 of Subchapter T. Many proposals accepted as partof an appeal or equivalency determination have been incorporated into thisproposed rulemaking. The expressed concerns of the National Association of Passenger VesselOwners (NAPVO), as well as other industry organizations, that the structuralfire protection requirements of Subchapter T are often too onerous resultedin the initiation of Coast Guard Docket CGD 85-021. NAPVO is a trade associationof approximately 330 small passenger vessel owners who operate primarilyexcursion boats, dinner cruise boats, and ferries. The small passengervessel organizations were primarily concerned about the application ofthe structural fire protection requirements of 46 CFR Subchapter H (PassengerVessels) to vessels carrying more than 150 passengers. On April 8, 1985, the Coast Guard published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (50 FR 13837) a request for comment and noticeof meeting on fire protection standards for small passenger vessels underCGD 85-021. The public meeting was held on April 17, 1985. Eighteen individualsinvolved with the small passenger vessel industry attended the public meeting.Eight separate letters containing numerous comments from individuals andorganizations involved with small passenger vessels were submitted in responseto the request for comments. The written comments and those received atthe public meeting covered a much larger range of regulatory topics thanwas originally intended by the scope of CGD 85-021. Because of the broad range of comments received under CGD 85-021 and forthe other reasons discussed above in <T3>Reason for Revision, </T3>the Coast Guard decided to initiate a completerevision of Subchapter T under CGD 85-080. Consequently, CGD 85-021 wascancelled on December 24, 1985. Comments received under CGD 85-021 weretransferred to CGD 85-080 and were considered in the development of thisproposed rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="85">Discussion of Proposed Regulations </ITAG>A detailed discussion of the proposed regulations is contained below. Topicswhich affect the contents of more than one part of the regulations proposedto be revised, such as organization, authority, reference changes, anddynamically supported craft, are discussed first. Significant changes toeach individual part in Subchapter T, and to Parts 170, 171, and 173 ofSubchapter S, are then discussed along with the reasons for the changes.For the convenience of the reader, the proposed changes to each part arediscussed in numerical order with the changes to Part 170 of SubchapterS discussed first and the proposed changes to Part 185 of Subchapter Tdiscussed last. Significant changes specifically discussed in this preamble may cause anincreased or decreased burden on small passenger vessel owners or may resultin administrative changes. Also discussed are revisions being proposedin order to reflect current policy, incorporate acceptable standards, andprovide consistency with existing, comparable regulations in other subchapters.Comments submitted under cancelled docket, CGD 085-021, and other recommendationsreceived by the Commandant are also discussed in this section if they providedsignificant input for the development of this proposal. Distribution and derivation tables are included at the end of this section.The distribution table shows where each section of the existing regulationswould go in the revised regulations. The derivation table shows where eachsection of the proposed regulations originates. Organization The basic organization of the proposed revised Subchapter T remains thesame as the existing regulations. The part numbers and topics remain thesame except for Parts 178 and 179. Parts 178 and 179 are reserved in theexisting Subchapter T. Under the proposed regulations, Part 178 containsregulations on intact stability and seaworthiness. Part 179 discusses subdivision,damage stability, and watertight integrity. These parts had originallybeen dedicated to stability and subdivision prior to November 4, 1983.Except for Part 180 (Lifesaving), the general order and topic of subparts,sections, and paragraphs in the proposed subchapter is basically unchangedfrom the existing subchapter. However, the outdated numbering system ofthe existing regulations is revised to correspond to the revised CFR numberingsystem. Each section (andSection; ) number includes the number of the partfollowed by a period and a sequential number. Consolidation of Regulations The Coast Guard is presently making an effort to consolidate vessel inspectionrequirements by subject matter into functional subchapters of 46 CFR. Eachmajor topic would be addressed in a single subchapter applicable to almostall vessels. Existing functional subchapters include Subchapter F (MarineEngineering), Subchapter J (Electrical Engineering), and Subchapter S (Subdivisionand Stability). The functional subchapters allow streamlining of regulationsand elimination of redundant material. Other functional subchapters plannedinclude 46 CFR Subchapters K (Fire Protection) and W (Lifesaving).The Coast Guard is making an exception to the development of functionalsubchapters for Subchapter T. The Coast Guard is proposing that almostall the regulations applicable to small passenger vessels be containedwithin Subchapter T, as they were previously. Subchapter T is an exceptionfor several reasons. The size of the small passenger vessel fleet, itsownership and management system, and the workload it generates for theCoast Guard necessitate the availability of a convenient and ready referencefor use by both the public and Coast Guard personnel. Small passenger vesselsare usually owned by small entities which are often without the financialcapabilities or expertise to research and evaluate numerous functionalsubchapters. Additionally, the standards in the proposed regulations aredesigned to meet the specific needs of small passenger vessels. If smallpassenger vessels had to comply with functional subchapters, detailed regulationswould have to be included in them on lifesaving equipment, fire protection,electrical equipment, etc., for small passenger vessels resulting in thefunctional subchapters being needlessly complicated for small passengervessel owners and operators.Consequently, the Coast Guard is proposing to move the stability and subdivisionregulations affecting most small passenger vessels from Subchapter S toSubchapter T. The proposed changes to Subchapter S are included as a partof this rulemaking. Additionally, under docket CGD 85-080A, the Coast Guard is proposing thatthe manning regulations affecting small passenger vessels be moved from46 CFR Part 15 to Part 186 of Subchapter T, where they were located priorto October, 1987. Notwithstanding the above, the Coast Guard still intends to require certainsmall passenger vessels to comply with portions of functional subchaptersincluding stability, machinery, and electrical, as well as with certainSubchapter H regulations applicable to passenger vessels. Many small passengervessels are under 100 gross tons only because of extensive tonnage reductionsand exemptions. Inclusion of appropriate regulations to sufficiently coversuch vessels in Subchapter T would require excessive space and would duplicatedetailed, acceptable regulations contained in the functional subchapters.Additionally, these vessels will generally be the larger ones whose owners,managing operators, and builders have the expertise to use and comply withapplicable portions of the functional subchapters. This proposal will includeauthority for the Commandant to determine when compliance with such additionalregulations is required.Authority Changes Public Law 98-89 of August 26, 1983, codified numerous laws relating tovessels and seamen and enacted Subtitle II of Title 46, U.S. Code, intopositive law. Its purpose was to revise and consolidate then existing lawswithout making substantive changes. This necessitates the updating of theregulations throughout Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations, includingSubchapter T, which contain authority citations and references to the lawswhich were repealed by Pub. L. 98-89. Consequently, this proposal reflectsthe current authority citations and statutory references for the regulationsproposed, including citation to 46 U.S.C. 3306 as the primary authorityto regulate small passenger vessels. Applicability Proposed andSection; 175.110 details the general applicability of SubchapterT. While the proposed rules apply to both new and existing small passengervessels, an existing vessel may, with some exceptions, comply with thenew regulations or the applicable construction, arrangement, and equipmentregulations in effect prior to the effective date of the proposed regulations.Proposed andSection; 175.400 defines a new vessel and an existing vessel.A section in each part of the proposed regulations, except Parts 175 and176, describes how that part applies to existing vessels. Where necessary,the basis of the application for certain new requirements to existing vesselsis explained in the discussion of the proposed rules for each part in thispreamble. Breakpoints The hazards and risks created by the operation of a small passenger vesselvaries greatly depending on length, total passenger capacity, existenceof overnight accommodations, number of decks, service, route, machinery,etc. Consequently, the Coast Guard has developed a graduated system ofregulations with increasingly more stringent requirements for a vesselor operation which presents increasingly greater safety hazards or risks.Breakpoints were developed to determine when a vessel is subject to particularregulations. Most breakpoints were originally mandated by Congress, establishedto comply with the intent of law, or result from an international convention.Examples of breakpoints presently existing in Subchapter T include 26 feet,65 feet, 49 passengers, and 150 passengers. Because of familiarity, most of the existing breakpoints were retainedin the proposed regulations. Any new requirements included in the proposedregulations were generally added within the framework of the existing breakpoints.This was done to limit the number of additional breakpoints and to minimizethe complexity of the regulations. New breakpoints included in the proposedregulations include: ``more than 400 passengers'' and ``with overnightaccommodations.'' Although not used in existing Subchapter T, these breakpointsare used in other existing regulations and Coast Guard policy. The applicationof the new breakpoints is explained in this preamble in the discussionof the regulations where the new breakpoints are used. Dynamically Supported Craft The proposed rules contain specific requirements for the design, construction,equipment, and operation of dynamically supported craft (DSC) which varyfrom those for conventional vessels. The proposed DSC regulations are primarilybased on the International Maritime Organization's ``Code of Safety forDynamically Supported Craft'' (IMO Code) adopted by IMO Resolution A.373(x)on November 14, 1977. The standards of other nations and classificationsocieties, and standards developed by the Coast Guard were also consideredduring the drafting of these proposed changes to Subchapter T. The proposalwould require the same design and operational standards for U.S. dynamicallysupported craft as is currently required for DSC of other countries. Thesources of many of the proposed DSC regulations are listed in the Referencecolumn of the Derivative Table in this preamble. The Coast Guard participated in the development of the IMO Code, supportsits philosophy, and has urged builders and designers of DSC to adopt portionsof the IMO Code to show equivalent levels of safety to conventional vesselregulations. The IMO Code was intended to be self-contained so that compliancewith it would ensure that a DSC would have the same level of safety asa vessel which complies with the International Convention for the Safetyof Life at Sea. Additionally, the IMO Code urges governments to developtheir own specific requirements regulating DSC based on the IMO Code itself.While many of the requirements in the IMO Code are specific to DSC, othersare general in nature and, in fact, are applicable to all small passengervessels. Accordingly, many of the general requirements from the IMO Codeare incorporated in these proposed regulations for application to all smallpassenger vessels. The methods, designs, or arrangements required by suchgeneral requirements are already common practice for most vessels. Hence,the cost of imposing them on all vessels is expected to be minimal. Anexample of a general requirement in the IMO Code which the Coast Guardproposes to be applied to all small passenger vessels is the requirementthat exit doors be capable of being operated from inside and outside thespace served (IMO Code 4.3.3). Recognizing the unique design and operational characteristics of DSC, theproposed regulations specifically applicable to DSC are a compilation ofsafety tradeoffs designed to provide an equivalent level of safety to thatof conventional displacement vessels. For example, requirements for structuralfire protection are reduced while more attention is given to passengerevacuation time and primary lifesaving equipment. Below is a general discussion of the reasons for and effects of primaryregulations applicable to DSC.1.<T3> Vessels included as dynamically supported craft.</T3> The definitionsof DSC in proposed andSection; 175.400(c) are adopted from the definitionsused in the IMO Code. As proposed, a vessel is considered a DSC if it canbe supported by other than hydrostatic forces as a conventional, displacementhull vessel is supported and if its maximum speed divided by the squareroot of the vessel's length times acceleration due to gravity is greaterthan or equal to 0.9 (that is where v/|gL&quot;0.9). The Coast Guard may alsoconsider using other means of defining a DSC which may better reflect thephysical feature of a DSC such as a speed displacement coefficient as follows:Fn<T3>)</T3>=v/|g<T3>)</T3>1/3. Air cushion vessels, hydrofoil vessels, and sidewall vesselsare DSC. Some high speed catamarans and high speed monohull vessels mayalso meet the definition of DSC and, due to their size, speed, and dynamicallysupported operations, are subject to safety hazards comparable to the hazardsto which air cushion vessels, hydrofoils, and side wall vessels are subject.2.<T3> Number of passengers.</T3> The IMO Code is applicable to DSC carryingmore than 12 but less than 450 passengers. The 12 passenger breakpointwas used in drafting the IMO Code to coincide with the definition of apassenger vessel in the Safety of Life at Sea Convention (SOLAS). However,specific DSC provisions of this proposal would apply to all DSC carryingmore than 6 passengers. Under this proposal, a DSC may carry not more than400 passengers. The 400 passenger limit, in contrast to the 450 passengerlimit recommended by the IMO Code, is used to minimize breakpoints. Fourhundred is presently used as a breakpoint for subdivision requirements.3.<T3> Fire protection.</T3> Under this proposal, a DSC carrying not morethan 150 passengers must comply with more fire protection requirementsthan a similar capacity conventional vessel. Included are requirementsfor structural fire protection bulkheads around machinery spaces and operatingstations, reduced fire loads, prohibition of gasoline engines, and theprotection of fuel injection pipes from hot oil. These requirements aredesigned to decrease the risk of fire on a DSC in recognition of the inabilityto operate a fixed firemain system when in the dynamically supported modeof operation. The structural fire protection requirements for a DSC carrying more than150 passengers would be less stringent than the requirements for a similarcapacity conventional vessel. If a DSC were to comply with all the structuralfire protection requirements for a conventional small passenger vesselcarrying more than 150 passengers, the weight of the vessel would makeoperations in the dynamically supported mode infeasible. A DSC must thereforecomply with other requirements, indicated below, to maintain a level ofsafety equivalent to that on a conventional small passenger vessel. 4.<T3> Operations manual.</T3> The proposal would require an operations manualon each DSC that explains and lists the operational restrictions of theDSC and the procedures by which these restrictions are to be complied with.5.<T3> Limited operating radius.</T3> The proposal restricts the operationof a DSC to within 100 miles of shore, which is the limit also imposedby the IMO Code. Other factors will also limit the route and time of operationsof a DSC. Environmental conditions limit the route of a DSC more than theroute of a conventional vessel. For example, exceeding certain wind velocity,sea state, or speed yaw limits may result in unacceptable control characteristics,motions, vibration, structural loads, or structural fatigue. Maintenanceservices and emergency assistance must also be available in the operatingarea of a DSC. 6.<T3> Failure mode and effects analysis.</T3> Prior to initial certificationof a DSC, an analysis would be required for each type of machinery andits associated control system. This analysis is necessary due to the highspeed rotating machinery on DSC and the damage and injury which may occuron DSC if machinery fails while the vessel is in a dynamically supportedmode. The analysis is intended to be performance oriented allowing themany unique machinery installations possible on a DSC to be suitably addressed.Presently, an analysis is normally generated by DSC designers. Therefore,this proposal is not expected to add additional costs to the purchase priceof a DSC. 7.<T3> Requirements for navigation and communications equipment.</T3> Theoperating speed of DSC makes the proposed additional equipment for navigation,including radar and fathometers, necessary. An individual on watch on aDSC has less time to react to visual and audible input than on most othervessels and has greater need for electronic aids. As recommended by theIMO Code, most DSC would have to maintain a continuous radio watch in orderto receive weather reports and emergency notices, and to maintain contactwith other vessels while navigating in a congested area. 8.<T3> Specific requirements for operating compartments.</T3> Because ofthe speed of DSC and the importance of maintaining a proper attitude withrespect to the surface of the water, the crew members on watch in the operatingstation of a DSC must not be distracted from their duties or be susceptibleto injury under normal or emergency conditions. For these reasons, DSCdesigners must position the controls, instruments, seating, and communicationsequipment in the operating station to allow the crew members to properlydischarge their responsibilities without undue difficulty. 9.<T3> Requirements for means of escape.</T3> This proposal contains specificrequirements for means of escape and a minimum evacuation time on DSC.Some of the proposed requirements for exits are new to the regulationsbut follow commonly accepted practice. Because structural fire protectionrequirements on DSC are directly tied to passenger evacuation time, evacuationtime must be determined in the design stage to permit evaluation of thestructural fire protection boundaries during plan review.10. <T3>Requirements for passenger seating.</T3> The proposed requirementsinclude seats for all passengers, seatbelts, and adjustable chairs thatmust lock in position. These are necessary because of possible rough rideswhile traveling at high speeds in heavy weather and transitioning betweenthe dynamically supported mode and the displacement mode. 11.<T3> Bilge system.</T3> A DSC may not be required to fully comply withthe bilge pump and piping requirements contained in Subpart E of proposedPart 182 if the vessel has a high degree of subdivision and compartmentation.12.<T3> Stability.</T3> This proposal requires that a DSC meet the stabilitystandards applicable to other small passenger vessels, based on the vessel'sroute, length, number of passengers being carried, and number of decks,when operating in the displacement mode. Compliance with such standardsfor intact stability, damage stability, and subdivision is necessary forsafety when the DSC is in the displacement mode of operation.DSC must also have satisfactory stability when operating in the dynamicallysupported mode. Although a number of standards for DSC designs exist, thereis no comprehensive standards suitable for all DSC designs. The BritishGovernment has standards for air cushion vehicles, the International MaritimeOrganization has standards for hydrofoil vessels, and the U.S. Navy hasa design standard which is well suited for surface effect ships. Due tothe diversity of designs and operating principles of DSC, and the limitedexperiences with DSC, it is necessary to evaluate their stability in thedynamically supported mode on an individual basis. This proposal allowsthe owner of a DSC to propose acceptable stability standards for operationsin the dynamically supported mode based on acceptable standards of otherorganizations or service trials and individual calculations for the vessel.Although an increase in the number of DSC is expected, there are not enoughDSC operating as small passenger vessels in the United States today toreliably determine the cost the proposed regulations will have on owners.Comments are therefore specifically requested on the cost of the proposalsinvolving DSC from persons that operate or build DSC or contemplate doingso. Specific Provisions For Large Vessels Three provisions in the present regulations give the OCMI and Commandantauthority to impose regulations in excess of Subchapter T when appropriate.In the past few years, an increasing number of vessels have been builtto which application of additional requirements under these provisionshas been appropriate. 1. Existing andSection; 175.05-1(b) authorizes the OCMI to require any vesselcarrying more than 150 passengers to comply with requirements in SubchapterH (Passenger Vessels), Subchapter P (Manning), Subchapter F (Marine Engineering),and Subchapter J (Electrical) of this chapter, which the OCMI considersappropriate. The manning requirements, previously in Subchapter P, wererecently revised and moved to Subchapter B. 2. Existing andSection; 175.05-15 provides that the Commandant shall prescriberegulations, in addition to those in Subchapter T, if the Commandant determinesthat the gross tonnage of a vessel has been reduced below 100 gross tonsby the extensive use of exemptions, reductions, or other devices in thetonnage formulation. If it were not for the extensive use of reductionsand exemptions, such a vessel would have had to comply with SubchapterH which generally contains more stringent standards than Subchapter T.3. Existing andSection; 177.10-5 states that vessels which carry more than150 passengers shall meet the structural fire protection requirements ofSubchapter H (Passenger Vessels). However, the OCMI is given the discretionas to how to apply those structural fire protection requirements. The OCMI is allowed discretion under andSection;andSection; 175.05-1(b) and177.10-5 because the OCMI is the most familiar with the local route ofa vessel and associated hazards. However, many vessels today operate inmore than one inspection zone. The discretion authorized to account forlocal differences now often results in significant inconsistencies amongvessels operating in the same area. The inconsistencies occur because thevessels were certificated in different inspection zones where the OCMIsimposed different regulations. The Coast Guard has received numerous commentsfrom small passenger vessel owners and managing operators complaining aboutsuch inconsistencies. To counter such inconsistencies, the Coast Guardhas promulgated policy guidance to Coast Guard field units and the smallpassenger vessel industry on the application of andSection;andSection; 175.05-1(b),175.05-15, and 177.10-5. Policy guidance has been issued in the form ofpolicy letters, the Coast Guard Marine Safety Manual, and Navigation andVessel Inspection Circular (NVIC) 11-83, ``Regulations for Very Large 46CFR Subchapter T Vessels''. The Coast Guard is proposing to incorporatemuch of this guidance into regulation thereby making the provisions ofthe guidance mandatory and reducing the discretion of the local OCMI. Thiswill help reduce the serious problems with inconsistencies among inspectionzones. By incorporating this policy guidance into regulation, the Coast Guardwould reduce but not eliminate the discretion of both the OCMI and Commandantin regulating small passenger vessels. Reducing the discretion is necessaryto limit inconsistencies, but some discretion is still necessary to addressunique situations. NVIC 11-83 As stated in NVIC 11-83, the Coast Guard has found that designers of mostsmall passenger vessels of more than 79 feet in length and of less than100 gross tons used one or more of the special provisions or interpretationsof the basic gross tonnage formulation so that such vessels weigh lessthan 100 gross tons. In certain circumstances, the safety hazards to whichsuch a ``very large'' small passenger vessel is subject may be offset byrestrictions on the use of the vessel. Examples of when this may be trueare when the vessel operates on restricted routes or when the vessel doesnot carry passengers in overnight accommodations. However, the Coast Guardhas found that in most instances where a ``very large'' small passengervessel has overnight accommodations for more than 50 passengers, increasedsafety hazards exist necessitating imposition of requirements in additionto those in Subchapter T, as authorized by existing andSection; 175.05-15.The Coast Guard published in NVIC 11-83 a list of regulations the Commandantoften makes applicable to vessels of less than 100 gross tons, of morethan 79 feet in length, and which have accommodations for more than 50overnight passengers. The additional regulations are contained in SubchapterF (Marine Engineering), Subchapter H (Passenger Vessels), Subchapter J(Electrical Engineering), and Subchapter S (Subdivision and Stability)of Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations. As part of the project to revise Subchapter T, the Coast Guard reviewedNVIC 11-83 and found that, after four years of use, the guidelines in thecircular are useful and most of the listed regulations applicable. Consequently,the Coast Guard has incorporated the contents of NVIC 11-83 into the proposedrules as indicated below. Most of the regulations listed in NVIC 11-83 are proposed in this noticeto be applicable to vessels of more than 65 feet in length which have overnightaccommodations for more than 49 passengers. The length criteria has beenreduced from 79 feet used in NVIC 11-83 to 65 feet to minimize the numberof breakpoints in the regulations. Sixty-five feet will remain the primarybreakpoint routinely used to classify separate regulations for large andsmall vessels inspected under Subchapter T. It was a breakpoint initiallyestablished by law and upon which the existing T-S and T-L vessel determinationsare made. The overnight accommodations criterion is reduced from more than50 passengers to more than 49 passengers also to minimize the number ofbreakpoints. The existing Subchapter T uses more than 49 passengers inseveral places including for stability purposes and for prescribing thenumber of fire and bilge pumps. More than 50 passengers is not presentlyused as a breakpoint in regulation. Some of the structural fire protection regulations of Subchapter H listedin NVIC 11-83 have been found to inadequately address the needs of theaffected small passenger vessels, often resulting in excessive requirements.Consequently, new structural fire protection regulations are proposed inSubchapter T which would adequately cover these ``very large'' small passengervessels with overnight accommodations for more than 49 passengers. Alternative Standards for Small Vessels The proposed regulations authorize specific alternative standards for vesselsof not more than 65 feet in length and carrying not more than 12 passengers.Under the proposal such vessels may comply with certain standards and recommendedpractices published by the American Boat and Yacht Council (ABYC) and certainrecreational boating safety regulations contained in 33 CFR SubchapterS, instead of fully complying with all standards in Subchapter T. Compliancewith the cited ABYC and recreational boating safety regulations is notrequired by the proposed regulations but allowed as an alternative to otherrequirements. This proposal would facilitate the conversion of stock boats,primarily designed for recreational boating and charterboat service, tosmall passenger vessel service. The specific sections of the proposed rulesdiscussing this alternative are andSection;andSection; 182.130, and 183.130.This proposal is based on a recommendation by the National Marine ManufacturersAssociation (NMMA) submitted to the Coast Guard under CGD 85-021. The NMMAis a trade association serving the recreational boating industry with approximately380 boat manufacturers and 790 equipment and material manufacturers andvendors as members. The NMMA is concerned that, under existing SubchapterT, a vessel which carries only a limited number of passengers, i.e. notmore than 12 passengers, must meet the same requirements as a vessel whichmay carry up to 49 passengers. Many of the vessels built by NMMA membermanufacturers are used as crewed charterboats and for demise charters.These vessels may have accommodations for up to 12 passengers. The NMMAbelieves that many of the regulations in Subchapter T should not be applicableto vessels of the size and type of service of those built by their members.These vessels, often certified by the association as complying with strictstandards, including ABYC standards and 33 CFR Subchapter S (RecreationalVessels) regulations, do not comply with many of the regulations in SubchapterT. However, the NMMA believes, because of their own strict standards, whichin some areas are in excess of Subchapter T, and because of proven safeoperation of the vessels built by their members, that those vessels arealso safe to operate as small passenger vessels. The NMMA proposed that Subchapter T be revised to contain a separate partwith specific regulations for chartered vessels, used as bareboat or withcrew, carrying not more than 12 passengers. Other parts of the subchapterwould be dedicated to other vessel types. The recommended charter vesselregulations contained much of the present Subchapter T regulations andalso incorporated certain ABYC standards and recreational vessel regulations.The Coast Guard agrees that there are sufficient differences in some aspectsof design, arrangement, and outfitting between a vessel carrying not morethan 12 passengers and one carrying not more than 49 passengers to consideralternative requirements for vessels carrying not more than 12 passengers.However, the Coast Guard disagrees that special consideration should begiven to charter vessels alone. The structural fire protection, outfittingof lifesaving and fire protection equipment, machinery and electrical arrangements,etc., on a small passenger vessel should not be based on the method bywhich a passenger arranges to use the vessel. Rather, such requirementsmust be based on the size of the vessel and its route. Additionally, thededication of individual parts of Subchapter T to each type, or even acombination of types, of small passenger vessels would result in inefficientduplication. Twelve passengers provides a satisfactory breakpoint for the establishmentof alternative requirements for smaller vessels for a few reasons. As pointedout by the NMMA, vessels designed and used for charter service are usuallyequipped with accommodations for more than six passengers and usually upto no more than twelve passengers. Additionally, a small passenger vesselon an international voyage carrying more than twelve passengers is subjectto the provisions of the International Convention for the Safety of Lifeat Sea (SOLAS). The Coast Guard is also proposing that, in addition to the 12 passengerlimitation, compliance with the alternative standards be allowed only forthose vessels of not more than 65 feet in length. As the size of a vesselincreases, the complexity and number of systems aboard the vessel increases.Vessels of more than 65 feet in length must fully comply with the regulationsin Parts 182 and 183 to adequately protect the vessel from the hazardsassociated with the increased number and complexity of systems found onthose vessels.46 CFR Subchapter S_Subdivision and Stability Subchapter S currently contains the subdivision and stability rules forall inspected vessels including small passenger vessels. This proposalmoves most of the stability and seaworthiness requirements for small passengervessels from Subchapter S into Subchapter T for the purpose of consolidatingmost regulations applicable to small passenger vessels into one inspectionsubchapter. The intact stability, subdivision, and damage stability standardsfor small passenger vessels that are more than 65 feet in length, carryingmore than 150 passengers, carrying 12 or more passengers on an internationalvoyage, or have more than one deck above the bulkhead deck exclusive ofthe pilot house would remain in Subchapter S to avoid duplication of therequirements which are also applicable to other inspected vessels. Additionally,the intact stability requirements for small passenger vessels propelledby sail would remain in Subchapter S. The proposal also revises some of the existing regulations applicable tosmall passenger vessels, which would remain in Subchapter S, to reflectcurrent Coast Guard policy. The proposed changes in Subchapter S only effectsmall passenger vessels and sailing school vessels, which are presentlyrequired to comply with the stability criteria for small passenger vesselspropelled by sail. Other changes to existing regulations in SubchapterS will be addressed under another regulatory docket in the future. Specific proposed changes to Subchapter S are discussed below in this sectionof the preamble. Changes to regulations proposed to be moved from SubchapterS to Subchapter T are discussed in the sections of this preamble entitled<T3>Part 178_Intact Stability and Seaworthiness, </T3>and <T3>Part 179_Subdivision, Damage Stability, and Seaworthiness. </T3><ITAG tagnum="81">Part 170_Stability Requirements for All Inspected Vessels </ITAG><T3>Section 170.001 Applicability. </T3>Proposed andSection; 170.001 revisesthe applicability of Subchapter S so that only vessels contracted for onor after the effective date of the final rules under this docket wouldhave to comply with the proposed changes to the subchapter. Vessels contractedbefore that date may be constructed in accordance with the regulationsin effect on the date of the signing of the contract. <T3>Section 170.055(h)(1) Definition of LBP. </T3>The proposed additionto existing andSection; 170.055(h)(1) allows the Commanding Officer of theCoast Guard Marine Safety Center to include large underwater projections,such as bulbous bows, in the LBP (length between perpendicular) of a smallpassenger vessel. Inclusion of such underwater projections is necessaryin determining watertight bulkhead spacing to better reflect the increasedlength of a vessel below the waterline and the actual possibility of damagebelow the waterline. Projections which contribute more than 2% of the underwatervolume of the vessel are normally included in the LBP. Few small passengervessels are expected to have such projections. The title, ``Commanding Officer, U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Center,''is used in the proposed change to andSection; 170.055(h)(1), other proposedrevisions in Subchapter S, and in Parts 177, 178, and 179 of the proposedSubchapter T. When the Coast Guard Merchant Marine Technical Offices (mmt)were disestablished in 1986, the responsibilities of the Commander (mmt)were transferred to the Commanding Officer of the Coast Guard Marine SafetyCenter. However, the title, ``Commander (mmt),'' used in sections of SubchapterS which are not addressed in this proposal, will not be replaced with thetitle, ``Commanding Officer, U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office,'' atthis time. <T3>Section 170.090 Assumed weight and vertical center of gravity of eachperson. </T3>Proposed paragraphs (c) and (d) contain standard values tobe used for the vertical center of gravity, weight, and location of passengerswhen performing loading calculations. This proposal incorporates CoastGuard policy which uses the average weight and center of gravity for astanding adult. The absence of such values in existing regulations resultsin inconsistencies among naval architects designing small passenger vessels.<T3>Sections 170.105(b)(1) and 170.160(b)(1) Small vessel exclusion. </T3>Thetext of existing andSection;andSection; 170.105(b)(1) and 170.160(b)(1) isdeleted because the applicable requirements for the vessels addressed therehave been placed in proposed Subchapter T. <T3>Section 170.170 Inclusion of rails and canopies in the projected lateralarea, and permitting the angle of heel to the deck edge on sailing vessels.</T3>The proposed changes to the definitions of certain parameters in themetacentric height formula in existing andSection; 170.170 incorporate long-standingpolicy. That policy interprets the projected area of a small passengervessel as including any areas of the vessel profile which can be fittedwith canvas, such as railings or canopies. The current regulations do notaddress this point, although the Coast Guard has applied this interpretationas a practical matter. Railings and canopies must be included in the projectedarea because they are frequently blocked off with canvas dodgers or plasticwind screens to protect passengers. Some small passenger vessels that are sailing vessels have had to limitthe number of passengers they can carry because the angle of heel whenapplying the critera for metacentric height (GM) in existing andSection;170.170 is presently limited to one-half of the freeboard of a vessel includinga sailing vessel. The existing criteria were initially developed for flushdeck, mechanically powered vessels of ordinary proportions and form thatcarry cargo below the main deck. The proposed rules allow sailing vesselsto be heeled up to the deck edge when applying the criteria in andSection;170.170 because a sailing vessel normally has a greater range of stabilityand a greater angle of downflooding than the type vessel for which thecriteria were initially developed. <T3>Section 170.173 (e) and (f) Alternative righting energy criteria. </T3>Theproposed changes to existing andSection; 170.173 allow, for the purpose ofconsistency, the same righting energy criteria that has been applied tovessels of unusual proportion and form in the past to be used as an alternativefor small passenger vessels. A Coast Guard policy allowing the relaxationof requirements for vessels that operate only on protected waters is alsoformalized in this proposal. The proposed criteria have histories of satisfactoryresults and recognize that vessels can be safely operated on protectedroutes with less stability than is required for exposed routes. As theserelaxations have been routinely allowed as a matter of policy, there willnot be a monetary benefit from this regulation change. <ITAG tagnum="81">Part 171_Special Rules Pertaining to Vessels Carrying Passengers </ITAG><T3>Subpart B ``Small Vessels.'' </T3>Subpart B is proposed to be deleted.The simplified stability test for sailing vessels in andSection; 171.035of existing Subpart B does not consider the full range of stability thata sailing vessel has as it heels to the downflooding or extremis angle.Even in protected and partially protected waters, there are squalls thatarise quickly that can cause a sailing vessel to heel further than itsdeck edge. The Coast Guard believes that the sailing vessel criterion ofexisting andSection; 171.055 or andSection; 171.057 should be used to checkall sailing vessels, regardless of their size, for their full range ofstability. The remainder of the provisions of Subpart B are contained in proposedPart 178 of Subchapter T. <T3>Section 171.050(b) Rail crowding criteria. </T3>Proposed andSection;171.050(b) incorporates existing policy for vessels, used for excursionssuch as to view parades or for sightseeing, on which a large number ofpassengers may move to the railings for better viewing. The passenger criteriain existing andSection; 170.050 considers passenger heeling but not to theextent considered by this proposal. Technical evaluation has shown thatvessels affected by this proposal are capable of being loaded in mannersnot adequately addressed by current criteria. Compliance with the proposedrequirement would probably result in the stability analysis required forcertification taking an additional hour of time. <T3>Sections 171.055 (d)(1), (d)(2), (e)(4)(ii), and (g)(1) Small passengersailing vessels. </T3>The existing sailing vessel stability criteria havebeen criticized by many naval architects and sailors as being too stringentfor small vessels because they make such vessels difficult to maneuverin light air. Similar to the sailing school vessel regulations, the proposedregulations in andSection; 171.055 contain graphs so that the stability numeralscan be reduced in exchange for higher angles of downflooding and vanishingstability. These proposed regulations do not impose any additional costs.Under the proposal small passenger vessels which are sailing vessels havethe option of using the existing criteria or the new criteria. Some vesselsmay benefit from the proposed changes since they may be able to carry moresail or be more maneuverable using the proposed criteria. <T3>Section 171.070 (e)(1) and (e)(2) Spacing of main watertight bulkheads.</T3>The proposed revisions to andSection; 171.070 state that a small passengervessel carrying more than 12 passengers on an international voyage mustcomply with the existing regulations indicated. This change incorporatesrequirements of the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea,1974, which small passenger vessels on an international voyage must complywith. Consequently, there are no costs resulting from this proposed change.<T3>Section 171.076 Bottom damage requirements for longitudinally subdividedvessels. </T3>Proposed andSection; 171.076 would allow longitudinal subdivisionand double bottoms to be used in lieu of transverse bulkheads to meet TypeII subdivision requirements. Under the current regulations, only transversebulkheads are sufficient to meet the subdivision requirements. The proposedstandard will provide designers with greater flexibility while maintainingthe current level of safety against collisions and groundings. <T3>Section 171.077 Damage stability requirements for multihull vessels.</T3>Proposed andSection; 171.077 incorporates existing Coast Guard policydefining the extent of damage which a multihull vessel is assumed to incurfor the purpose of determining subdivision requirements. It describes theanalysis necessary to demonstrate equivalency to Type II subdivision. Theexisting regulations are not directly applicable to multihull vessels.This proposal does not impose any additional costs. <T3>Section 171.080(d)(5) Range of stability and righting energy in damagedconditions. </T3>Proposed andSection; 171.080(d)(5) establishes standardsfor approving a small passenger vessel's range of stability in the damagedcondition which are similar to international standards. The existing requirementto have 2 inches of positive GM in the equilibrium condition does not ensurethat small passenger vessels will survive in this condition. Analysis hasshown that launching survival craft would capsize some vessels which meetthe current criteria. The proposed criteria are less severe than thosewhich are now being applied for an equilibrium angle of heel of greaterthan 7 degrees. Existing regulations allow the Commanding Officer of theMarine Safety Center to approve a vessel's range of stability in the damagedcondition if the equilibrium angle of heel is greater than 7 degrees. SomeMerchant Marine Technical Offices (mmt) previously imposed criteria moresevere than those of the proposal when they determined that greater stabilitythan was required by regulation was necessary on a vessel with an equilibriumangle of heel of 7 degrees or less. An estimated 5% of the vessels subject to proposed andSection; 171.080(d)(5)would have to have additional fixed ballast or bulkheads, beyond thoserequired by existing regulations, to comply with the proposal. The additionalbulkheads or ballast would cost approximately $5000 per vessel. <T3>Sections 171.114, 171.119, 171.124, and 171.140 through 171.155. </T3>Therequirements of existing andSection;andSection; 171.114, 171.119, 171.124,and 171.140 through 171.155 are contained in Parts 178 and 179 of the proposedSubchapter T. 46 CFR Subchapter T <ITAG tagnum="81">Part 175_General Provisions </ITAG><T3>Section 175.110 General applicability. </T3>This section revises existingandSection;andSection; 175.05-1, 175.05-2, and 175.05-3 to better reflect 46U.S.C. 3301, 3302,  and 3303. The proposed applicability section does notinclude offshore supply vessels as does existing andSection; 175.05-2. Offshoresupply vessels will be specifically addressed in proposed rules being developedunder a separate rulemaking (CGD 82-004, RIN 2110-AA77). <T3>Section 175.200 Gross tonnage as criterion for requirements. </T3>Thissection remains basically intact as in existing andSection; 175.05-15. ltis included to inform builders and owners that the Commandant may prescriberegulations in addition to or in place of those in Subchapter T if theCommandant determines that a small passenger vessel, which has measuredunder 100 gross tons only because of extensive use of exemptions, reductions,or other devices in the gross tonnage formulation, may be subjected tosafety hazards or risks that regulations in Subchapter T do not adequatelyaddress. While these proposed rules eliminate much of the need for existing andSection;175.05-15, small passenger vessels may be built in the future of a sizeor passenger carrying capacity which creates a safety hazard or risk thatis not adequately addressed by these proposed regulations. <T3>Section 175.400 Definitions. </T3>Many definitions have been revisedto make editorial changes and clarify the existing meaning of terms. Definitionsof words such as ``passenger'' have been revised to agree with statute.Another significant change is that ``sailing vessel'' now includes bothvessels which are propelled only by sail and auxiliary sail vessels. Auxiliarysail vessels are no longer separately defined since they are not treateddifferently by the regulations. Several new definitions are added to define terms which exist in the presentregulations, which are not presently defined, and which experience showsneed to be defined. Such terms include ``dripproof'', `` gross tonnage'',``watertight'', and ``weathertight''. Several new terms are added which are used in the proposed regulationsbut are not used in the existing regulations. An ``operating station''is defined. This term is used in several new sections and replaces theterms pilothouse or bridge in existing sections since those existing termsare inappropriate for many small passenger vessels. A ``dynamically supported craft'', along with several terms associatedwith dynamically supported craft, are defined. The definitions are adoptedfrom the IMO ``Code of Safety for Dynamically Supported Craft''. Dynamicallysupported craft is also abbreviated ``DSC''. <T3>Section 175.530 Alternative standards. </T3>This proposed section wouldallow owners or managing operators of certain conventional, displacementhull vessels to choose to comply with all the specific regulations fora dynamically supported craft (DSC). This alternative would allow conventionalvessels carrying more than 150 but not more than 400 passengers to meetthe reduced structural fire protection requirements of a DSC if the ownerfeels it is advantageous to do so. Hence, a DSC would not be given an economicadvantage solely because of the regulations. However, an owner choosingto use this alternative would have to comply with all the applicable specificrequirements for a DSC including additional plan and analysis submittal,operations manual, possible route restrictions, operating requirements,etc.<ITAG tagnum="81">Part 176_Certificate of Inspection</ITAG><T3>Section 176.100 When required. </T3>This section revises existing andSection;andSection;176.01-1 and 176.01-3 by deleting the references to T-S and T-L vessels,and more importantly, by requiring that a vessel be in compliance withthe terms of its Certificate of Inspection at all times in accordance with46 U.S.C. 3313. Existing andSection; 176.01-1 states that a T-S vessel neednot comply with its COI when carrying not more than 6 passengers. ProposedandSection; 176.114 would alleviate hardships caused by this legal restriction.<T3>Section 176.103 Description. </T3>This section adds to the presentandSection; 176.01-5 by stating that the maximum number of passengers thata vessel may carry in overnight accommodation spaces will be indicatedon its Certificate of Inspection (COI). This is necessary because manyregulations are based on that number and because passengers should be awareof how many passengers a vessel is authorized to carry in overnight accommodationspaces. <T3>Section 176.107 Period of validity. </T3>The Coast Guard proposes inthis section that Certificates of Inspection be valid on all small passengervessels, except those with SOLAS Certificates, for a period of three years.46 U.S.C. 3307 requires that all small passenger vessels be inspected atleast once every three years. However, existing Subpart 176.01 requiresthat vessels of more than 65 feet in length be inspected and reissued aCOI every year as previously required by 46 U.S.C. 404. The three yearinspection period is proposed to comply with the intent of Pub. L. 96-378,as now codified in 46 U.S.C. 3307, to provide more uniform requirementsfor all small passenger vessels, and to decrease the administrative burdenon both industry and the Coast Guard. Under the proposed andSection; 176.500,all vessels would be required to undergo a reinspection at yearly intervalsduring the term of a COI. Although the scope of a reinspection is the sameas a triennial inspection for certification, the administrative work andthe detail of a reinspection is somewhat less than that for a triennialinspection, and the total time involved is less. <T3>Section 176.114 Special endorsement for carrying six or less passengers.</T3>This proposed section would allow the owner of a vessel to requestto have the certificate of inspection endorsed to permit operation of thevessel in accordance with the laws and regulations applicable to an uninspectedpassenger vessel when carrying six or less passengers. The endorsementwould require the vessel to be maintained and outfitted in accordance withthe requirements of its COI except for manning and route. This would allowvessels to be operated competitively on the same route and with the samemanning as uninspected vessels. <T3>Section 176.600 Drydock and internal structural examination intervals.</T3>This rulemaking proposes to extend the interval between drydockingsand internal structural examinations to two years for all vessels operatingin salt water. Except for wooden vessels the existing fresh water drydockinginterval of five years is retained for vessels operating in fresh waterat least nine months in any twelve month period. The interval for woodenhull vessels would be two years regardless of the waters on which operated.Presently the drydock interval for all vessels is 18 months except forthe 5 year intervals prescribed for vessels in exclusive fresh water serviceand the 36 month intervals for partial fresh water service. The proposed two year period will allow owners to easily schedule examsaround the normally seasonal operations of most small passenger vessels.The present 18 month drydock interval for most vessels often forces ownersand operators to take their vessels out of the water during the peak operatingseason. This interval also forces many owners to repeatedly request the6 month drydock extensions that the OCMI is authorized to grant. The averageannual savings for the whole small passenger vessel fleet due to this change,including the decreased drydock period for wooden hull boats in freshwaterservice, is approximately $293,000 based on an average drydocking costof $500.00 per vessel. The interval for wooden hull vessels in fresh waterservice has been decreased because fresh water accelerates deteriorationof wood due to rot. A thorough discussion of drydock intervals is contained in the Notice ofProposed Rulemaking and the Interim Final Rule on Intervals for Drydockingon Inspected Vessels published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on May 30, 1986 (51 FR 19720) and October 23,1987 (52 FR 39693), respectively. Because of the ongoing project to reviseSubchapter T, the Interim Final Rule did not affect the drydock intervalsfor small passenger vessels. However, much of the discussion in the preamblesfor both the NPRM and the interim final rules are relevant to small passengervessels. <T3>Section 176.808 Lifesaving. </T3>This section contains proposed  inspectionrequirements for lifesaving equipment for an inspection for certification.Other sections in Subpart H contain inspection requirements for other typesof equipment and systems. Most of proposed Subpart H incorporates existingregulations. However, andSection; 176.808(a)(1) requires that rescue boatsand launching appliances be tested and inspected in accordance with SubchapterW. 46 CFR Subchapter W is a functional subchapter on lifesaving equipmentbeing developed under Coast Guard Docket 84-069, RIN 2115-AB72. Additionalinformation on Subchapter W is contained in the discussion of proposedPart 180 in this preamble. <ITAG tagnum="81">Part 177_Construction and Arrangement </ITAG><T3>Subpart A_General Provisions. </T3>The proposed regulations in thispart would not be applicable to existing vessels except by choice of anowner or for new construction or modifications made to an existing vessel.Repairs or replacements-in-kind would not have to be made in compliancewith these proposed requirements, but they would have to meet the requirementseffective when the vessel was built. However, the owner could choose tomeet these proposed requirements for repairs or replacements-in-kind. <T3>Subpart B_Plans and Information Required. </T3>Proposed Subpart B listsmore plans required to be submitted to the OCMI for approval than doesexisting Subpart 177.05 which it would replace. However, all the planslisted may not be applicable to a particular vessel. In most cases, theplans in the proposed list only amplify the plans which are currently requiredby existing regulations and are, in practice, already required by the OCMIor needed by the builder for construction of the vessel. Consequently,additional costs as a result of this part of the proposed rules is expectedto be minimal.Coast Guard policy requires that the Commanding Officer of the Coast GuardMarine Safety Center (MSC) approve all structural fire protection and generalarrangement plans for small passenger vessels carrying more than 150 passengersin excursion service or more than 50 passengers on overnight voyages. Thispolicy was recently instituted to minimize inconsistencies in the applicationof requirements to such vessels. To coincide with the breakpoints in thisproposal, this policy will be revised to require the MSC to approve allstructural fire protection and general arrangement plans for small passengervessels carrying more than 150 passengers in excursion service or whichhave overnight accommodations for more than 49 passengers. Proposed andSection; 177.202(a) requires that all plans still be submittedto the OCMI. However, the OCMI will forward those plans to the MSC whichare required by policy or regulation to be approved by the MSC, unlessthe OCMI allows an owner to submit plans directly to the MSC as authorizedby proposed andSection; 177.202(c). The proposed plan submittal requirementsensure that the OCMI is aware of the request for plan approval of a vesselthe OCMI may certify, and that plans for a vessel the MSC may approve donot conflict with plans for the vessel the OCMI may approve.<T3>Subpart C_Hull Structure.</T3> Proposed Subpart C would require compliancewith the design requirements of industry standards which are incorporatedby reference. The proposed subpart informs builders and owners of exactlywhat standards may be used for structural design. The 5 year rule in existingandSection; 177.10-1 is retained except that only vessels of not more than65 feet may be approved under it. Analysis techniques are now availablewhich may be used to determine the adequacy of all hull designs. It isespecially important to determine the adequacy of hull design of largervessels because of their size, passengers carried, and service. ProposedandSection; 177.340 is a result of the variety of structural analysis techniqueswhich now allow an owner to use any satisfactory, systematic analysis toprove certain vessels are structurally adequate. Computers and modern analysistechniques, such as finite element methods, are now routinely used in navalarchitecture. The proposal also contains specific structural design requirements fordynamically supported craft and sailing vessels. <T3>Subpart D_Fire Protection.</T3> In developing Subpart D, includingthe structural fire protection bulkhead and deck requirements, the normalarrangements, uses, and fire risks of large excursion vessels were considered.Bulkhead and deck requirements were then developed considering the newfire protection equipment requirements being proposed in Part 181 includingfixed gas fire extinguishing systems and detecting systems, and the proposedrequirements for means of escape and muster and embarkation stations. The existing requirements of Subchapter H, the structural fire protectionrequirements of the International Convention for the Safety of Life atSea (1974), shoreside building codes, and the U.S. Coast Guard Navigationand Vessel Inspection Circular No. 6-80 (NVIC 6-80, ``Guide to StructuralFire Protection Aboard Merchant Vessels'') were considered in determiningthe most appropriate requirements for small passenger vessels. This proposed subpart contains regulations designed to minimize or preventthe spread of fire through the reduction or elimination of combustiblematerial, and the separation of fire sources from other parts of a vesselby fire boundaries. Existing andSection; 177.10-5 contains the only structuralfire protection regulations for small passenger vessels. Except for vesselscarrying more than 150 passengers and fiber reinforced plastic vessels,the existing regulations are limited and only require that fire hazardsbe minimized insofar as is reasonable and practicable, hot exhausts besuitably insulated, and flammable liquid lockers be lined with metal. Vesselscarrying more than 150 passengers must presently comply with the structuralfire protection requirements of Subpart 72.05 of Subchapter H (PassengerVessels) as determined to be applicable by the OCMI. In accordance withexisting andSection; 177.10-5(a-1), fiber reinforced plastic vessels, carryingnot more than 150 passengers, must presently be constructed of fire retardantresins which meet MILSPEC R-21607. Although the small passenger vessel fleet generally has a satisfactoryfire safety record, especially in comparison with uninspected vessels,sufficient significant fires have occurred since the structural fire protectionregulations in existing Subchapter T were promulgated to necessitate theregulations proposed in this subpart. 1. Coast Guard records show the following statistics involving fires onsmall passenger vessels from 1981 to 1986:<ITAG tagnum="25">Total fire casualties_87; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Vessels which were a total loss due to fire_10 (11% of all fires);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Fires occurring in machinery spaces_50 (57% of all fires); </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Fires on wood hull vessels-28 (32% of all fires); </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Fires on FRP vessels-25 (28% of all fires).</ITAG>2. As noted above, 32% of all fires occurred on wood hull vessels and 28%occurred on FRP vessels. Wood hull vessels also compose 32% of the smallpassenger vessel fleet, but FRP vessels compose only 20% of the fleet.The National Transportation Safety Board has made many recommendationsinvolving fire protection as a result of casualties involving small passengervessels. These have been examined, and many of their recommendations havebeen incorporated in the proposed regulations. 3. Subchapter H structural fire protection requirements were developedprimarily for large passenger vessels and do not adequately address thefire risks involved with most small passenger vessels carrying more than150 passengers which operate today. The number of such small passengervessels has increased since initial promulgation of the Subchapter T. Proposed andSection; 177.400 contains general arrangement and outfittingrequirements designed to reduce fire risks on all vessels. The proposedsection combines applicable general arrangement and outfitting requirementslocated in existing andSection; 177.10-5 and other sections of the existingSubchapter T, with several new requirements based on accepted industrystandards. Proposed andSection; 177.400(e) is a new requirement for vapor barriers tocover insulation in spaces such as machinery spaces and paint lockers.Vapor barriers are considered necessary to maintain the fire resistanceof insulation when the insulation is exposed to combustible vapors or liquidwhich can permeate the insulation. Saturated insulation can not only addto the fire load of a space but can defeat the insulating qualities ofthe material. Similar provisions are contained in the 1974 InternationalConvention for the Safety of Life at Sea, as amended. Proposed andSection; 177.400(g) limits paint thickness to 0.075 inches oninterior surfaces of enclosed and partially enclosed spaces. Existing SubchapterT does not address paint thickness. However, andSection;andSection; 72.05-15(e)and 72.05-45 of Subchapter H, which are applicable to small passenger vesselscarrying more than 150 passenger and ``very large'' small passenger vesselswith overnight accommodations for more than 49 passengers, limit paintto a reasonable thickness. Existing andSection; 177.10-5 does require firehazards to be minimized, which would also include excessive buildup ofcombustible paint. To minimize inconsistencies, it is necessary to limitthe maximum paint thickness on interior surfaces to the allowed thicknessof combustible veneer and approved Interior Finishes found in andSection;164.012 of 46 CFR Subchapter Q (Equipment, Construction, and Materials:Specifications and Approval). Proposed andSection; 177.400(h) requires that all mattresses comply withthe Department of Commerce flammability standards for mattresses (16 CFRPart 1632, Subpart A) to minimize fire hazards. New mattresses that donot meet the proposed flammability standard can not legally be sold inthe United States. A small passenger vessel owner purchasing a new mattresscomplying with the proposed requirement would save money compared to thecurrent requirement in existing andSection; 177.30-7(b), that mattressesbe covered with a material which has been treated to give it fire resistantproperties. Since the only mattresses for sale are those complying withthe proposed rule, the owner will no longer have to buy a treated covering.Proposed 177.400(h) prohibits the use of polyurethane foam mattresses.Polyurethane foam has been found to give off highly toxic fumes when exposedto fire. Mattresses not made with polyurethane are readily available. Theeconomic impact of this prohibition is expected to be minimal. Proposed Subpart D also contains separate sections on structural fire protectionaddressing the fire risks associated with vessels of different sizes andtypes of operation. The proposed rule uses the breakpoints in existingSubchapter T and NVIC 11-83. One comment submitted under CGD 85-021 recommendedthat a graduated system be developed. This proposal contains a graduatedsystem for structural fire protection regulations based on a vessel's passsengercapacity and the number of overnight accommodations for passengers. Structuralfire protection requirements for dynamically supported craft are also proposed.Proposed andSection; 177.420 contains structural fire protection requirementsfor vessels carrying not more than 150 passengers or with overnight accommodationsfor not more than 49 passengers. It requires that when vessels are constructedof fiber reinforced plastic, including composite construction of fiberreinforced plastic and wood, the resin used must have a flame spread ofnot more than 100. The flame spread is determined by testing in accordancewith the American Society of Testing Material (ASTM) Standard E-84, ``StandardTest Method for Burning Characteristics of Building Material,'' or UnderwritersIaboratories, Inc. (UL) Standard 723, ``Test for Surface Burning Characteristicsof Building Materials''. The test must be performed by an independent testinglaboratory acceptable to the Coast Guard. Test standards ASTM E-84 andUL 723 are identical. Reference is made to both throughout as an aid toanyone trying to locate acceptable material, since a material may be testedand marked to either standard. The allowable flame spread rating of 100 is equal to that of red oak. Requiringthat resin have a spread of 100 would allow the use of readily available,industrial grade FRP resins which provide adequate fire retardation. Proposed andSection; 177.420(c) mandates a maximum flame spread for verticaland horizontal surfaces within 3 feet of cooking appliances. The proposalalso prohibits draperies, curtains, or free hanging fabrics from beingfitted within three feet of cooking appliances. This proposed regulationwas adopted from industry standards NFPA 701 and ABYC Project A-3-70 andis consequently expected to have limited economic impact. Vessel ownersare already required to minimize the amount of combustible material withinclose distance of cooking appliances under the mandate of existing andSection;177.10-5(a). Proposed andSection;andSection; 177.430 through 177.439 contain specific structuralfire protection regulations for vessels carrying more than 150 passengerswhich do not have overnight accommodations for more than 49 passengers.This includes large daytime excursion or tour vessels, dinner cruise vessels,and ferries. Presently, such vessels must comply with structural fire protectionregulations in Subchapter H (Passenger Vessels), as determined appropriateby the cognizant OCMI. A common complaint from the small passenger vesselindustry is that the regulations in Subchapter H are applied inconsistentlyby various OCMIs, although vessels may be of common design and operatein the same area. With the incorporation of specific structural fire protectionrules in Subchapter T, inconsistencies should decrease. Exceptions to theproposed rules would only be allowed when equivalencies are accepted bythe Commandant under proposed andSection; 175.540, or the OCMI determinesunder proposed andSection; 175.550 that departure from specific requirementsis necessary due to unusual circumstances or arrangements and that an equivalentlevel of safety is provided.Proposed andSection; 177.430 contains tables for use in determining the minimumstructural fire protection requirements for bulkheads and decks on vesselscarrying more than 150 passengers. These tables require certain bulkheadsand decks in various types of spaces to have a minimum fire rating. Theproposed tables are similar to tables in Subchapter H, however, the numberof tables has been reduced from four to two in comparison to SubchapterH. The number of categories of spaces has also been reduced from 13 inSubchapter H to 11 in the proposed requirements. For instance, the threedifferent categories of accommodation spaces in Subchapter H have beenreduced to two categories of accommodation spaces in this proposal; highrisk accommodation spaces (Type 4) and low risk accommodation space (Type5). The difference between the spaces would be the amount of combustiblematerial permitted in them; a low risk accommodation space would be permittedto have only one-half the amount of combustible materials permitted ina high risk accommodation space. The proposed tables in andSection; 177.430 (c) and (d) would permit a reductionin the structural fire protection boundary requirements between an adjoiningaccommodation space and a service space, compared to Subchapter H. Thisis in recognition of the decreased fire risk on vessels such as tour vesselsand ferries, which normally have reduced amounts of combustible furnishings.This concept is employed in Subchapter H with graduated structural fireprotection requirements for larger spaces and for spaces with more combustiblematerial. The required standard of some decks and bulkheads has been reducedin comparison with Subchapter H because of the requirements in Part 181for detecting systems and for fixed gas fire extinguishing systems. Proposed andSection; 177.432(b) establishes a maximum fire load for individualhigh risk accommodation spaces, high risk service spaces, and control spacesof 6.0 lb/ft\2\. The fire load is based on the weight of all combustiblematerials, furnishings, veneers, etc., in a space, except Coast Guard approvedInterior Finishes and UL listed coatings and sheathings for use in fireresistant construction, as explained below. Proposed andSection; 177.432(c) allows ceiling and acoustical tiles, coatingsand sheathings, and linings listed or approved by an independent testinglaboratory, to be used instead of having to be Coast Guard approved aspresently required by Subchapter H. However, these materials still mustmeet flame spread rating and smoke development rating requirements in accordancewith specific American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) or UnderwritersLaboratories Inc. (UL) test standards. The Coast Guard has received numerouscomplaints from industry stating that Coast Guard approved materials aredifficult to obtain and more costly than industrial grade material whichprovides an equivalent level of safety in comparison to approved materials.The Coast Guard agrees with these arguments and intends to allow use ofacceptable and more readily available industrial grade material. The proposedrequirements of paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of andSection; 177.432 willfurther encourage use of material meeting the requirement of 46 CFR 164.012or UL listed materials by not requiring these materials to be includedin the fire load calculations of andSection; 177.432(b). However, the Coast Guard is proposing to retain the requirement that structuralfire protection bulkhead material and all insulation be Coast Guard approvednoncombustible material, because the proven fire rating of such materialsis necessary to ensure that fire control boundaries are adequate. Proposed andSection; 177.432(g) contains standards for deck covering on vesselscarrying more than 150 passengers. Previously, these vessels were requiredto comply with andSection; 72.05-10 (n) through (q) of Subchapter H. Section72.05-10 requires carpeting to be wool or equivalent to wool in fire-resistivequalities if used in stairways or corridors, and permits any carpet ina large public space with combustible furnishings (type 7 space). Theseproposed requirements would require carpet to be wool or have a flame spreadrating of 75 or less and a smoke developed rating of 100 or less when testedto ASTM E-84 or UL 723. This incorporates current policy contained in NVIC6-80 which allows carpet with a flame spread rating of 75 or less and asmoke developed rating of 100 or less, when tested to ASTM E-84 or UL 723,to be considered equivalent to wool in fire-resistive qualities. The proposedregulations would also allow carpets and rugs tested to ASTM E-648, ``Testfor Critical Radiant Flux of Floor Covering Systems Using a Radiant HeatEnergy Source,'' to be used if the critical radiant flux was not less than0.45 watts per square centimeter and the specific optical density is notmore than 450 when tested to ASTM E-662, ``Test for Specific Optical Densityof Smoke Generated by Solid Materials''. These test methods are widelyused in the carpet industry and it is expected that carpet meeting thisproposal would be readily available to the small passenger vessel industry.These carpets and rugs would have to be included in the fire load calculationsas combustible materials since they will in fact burn. Wooden deck coveringsfor dance floors would be permitted as a leveling or finishing material,if not more than \3/8\ of an inch in thickness. Proposed andSection; 177.432(h) revises the existing regulations by requiringfurniture and drapes to comply with certain industrial standards. By specifyingminimum standards for furnishings, the requirements for bulkheads and deckscan be reduced without compromising safety. Industry standards are usedso that vessel builders and owners have a much wider range of productsto choose from than if the more restrictive requirement in Subchapter Hfor fire resistant furnishings is applied. Proposed andSection; 177.432(h)includes a requirement that upholstered furniture meet the National FireProtection Association (NFPA) Standard 260B. This standard is currentlyrecommended as the industry standard by the Business and InstitutionalFurniture Manufacturer's Association. The standard was originally developedby the National Bureau of Standards for the Consumer Product Safety Commission.Proposed andSection; 177.434 contains requirements for windows and air portsin fire control boundaries on vessels carrying more than 150 passengers.The requirements contained in Subchapter H would be applied to windowsin interior fire control boundaries. The requirements would allow an ownerto choose glass meeting the requirements in Subchapter H or glass thatis listed by UL under the category ``Fire Window Frames and Glazing Materials''in interior B-Class bulkheads. Windows, in fire control boundaries, adjacentto embarkation stations, muster stations, escape routes and survival craftwould be required to have glass meeting an A-Class fire protection standardor be fitted with shutters of steel or equivalent material operable fromoutside the space. A-Class glass is a relatively new product which haspassed the standard fire test for A-Class construction. Subchapter H presently requires that windows opening onto embarkation stationsbe fitted with wire inserted glass. The similar use of wire inserted glasswould not be allowed on small passenger vessels under this proposal becausethe Coast Guard believes that wire inserted glass does not provide adequatestructural fire protection. Shutters or A-Class or equivalent windows arenecessary to maintain the fire integrity of windows and air ports in wayof embarkation or muster stations, escape routes, or survival craft. Proposed andSection; 177.436 contains requirements for decorative doors anddoors in fire control bulkheads used on a vessel carrying more than 150passengers. These requirements would limit a single door to not more than48 inches in width and includes provisions for hose ports fitted in doorsin fire control bulkheads. The proposed requirements would also establishstandards for the installation of horizontal doors in decks. These requirementsare based upon similar requirements contained in the National Fire ProtectionAssociation (NFPA) Standard 101 ``Life Safety Code'', and are considerednecessary due to the number of such arrangements that have been permittedon small passenger vessels in the last several years. Many of the requirementsof Subchapter H for doors in fire control bulkheads have been incorporatedin these proposed regulations because doors, if not properly designed,constructed, installed, and fitted can degrade the fire resistive propertiesof fire control boundaries in which they are fitted. Proposed andSection; 177.438 contains requirements for stairs, stairtowers,elevators, and ladders on vessels carrying more than 150 passengers. TheCoast Guard is concerned that not enough attention has been paid to passengerevacuation on small passenger vessels with high passenger densities. Theminimum tread width in a stairway or stairtower is therefore being proposedto be increased to 36 inches. If the stairway will serve more than 120passengers, the minimum stairway tread width would be increased by 0.3inches for each additional passenger. This proposal incorporates conceptsfrom NFPA 101. Many of the requirements contained in Subchapter H havebeen included here in different updated format. Proposed andSection; 177.439 contains new requirements for vessels carryingmore than 150 passengers that have a balcony or other opening in a deckin a passenger accommodation space. These openings create a two level spacewith a large volume and large total combustible load. The proposal requiresthat for andSection; 177.439 to be applicable, an opening that creates atwo level space must be large enough so that a person on either level ofthe space can see a fire in any portion of the space. This would be achievedby allowing a partial deck to be limited to 80 percent of the availablearea. This would prevent decks, which have openings between them whichare too small to allow complete viewing of one level from the other levelof the space, from being considered balconies. Otherwise, decks with smallopening between them might be labeled as balconies and thus circumventthe requirements for decks which are contained in proposed andSection; 177.430.The concept of the proposed requirements was drawn from NFPA 101 whichhas stringent requirements for spaces containing balconies. Part of thoserequirements is the ability of persons in the space to be able to exitfrom the space without changing levels. This would help prevent passengersfrom becoming trapped on one level by a fire on the other level. ProposedandSection; 177.500(f) requires that the number and dimensions of the meansof escape be such that two-thirds of passengers on each level be able toexit from that level, if a stairway is contained within the space, otherwisethe requirements for means of escape would not differ from other spaces.Proposed andSection; 177.440 would require that small passenger vessels withovernight accommodations for more than 49 passengers be required to meetthe structural fire protection requirement of andSection; 72.05 of SubchapterH. This is currently the guidance contained in NVIC 11-83. Proposed andSection; 177.450 requires dynamically supported craft to havefire control boundaries for machinery spaces, galleys, and control stations.The degree of protection would be dependent upon the evacuation time asdetermined by calculations in the design stage and confirmed by an evacuationdemonstration after construction. Fire control boundaries would be requiredto be rated at three times the evacuation time plus seven minutes but notless than 30 minutes, which is the international standard contained inthe IMO ``Code of Safety for Dynamically Supported Craft.'' The proposed regulations in Subpart D are based on the minimal structuralfire protection regulations in existing Subchapter T, the detailed structuralfire protection requirements in Subchapter H, established policy used toreasonably apply the existing regulations to small passenger vessels, andallowances for acceptable shoreside material. These four components ofproposed Subpart D combine to provide an adequate level of safety whichmay be readily achieved by most small passenger vessels. Additionally,the proposed fire control boundaries and allowances for the use of shoresidematerials are estimated to provide a savings of $12,000 in the constructionof the average small passenger vessel carrying more than 150 passengers.<T3>Subpart E_Escape and Muster Station Requirements. </T3>Proposed andSection;177.500 revises the requirements for means of escape from spaces in smallpassenger vessels primarily by clarifying the existing requirements inandSection; 177.15-1. Present policy and requirements from the IMO Code forDynamically Supported Craft and from 46 CFR Subchapter H, which shouldbe applicable to all passenger vessels, are also incorporated into theproposed regulations. The incorporation of such requirements from SubchapterH and the IMO Code is not expected to require modifications to most smallpassenger vessel designs. Where modifications are necessary, added constructioncosts are expected to be small. The proposed regulations emphasize thatregardless of the required minimum number or arrangement of means of escapefrom a space, the actual number and dimensions of means of escape mustbe adequate to allow rapid egress in an emergency for the maximum numberof persons allowed to normally occupy a space. Proposed andSection; 177.500(h) specifies that the width of a door used asa means of escape from a space which is designed to hold more than 49 passengersmust be at least 32 inches, and that the sum of the width of all doorsfor the space must be at least 0.3 inches times the number of passengersfor which the space is designed. The existing regulations do not containany requirements on the size of doors used as means of escape. The proposeddoor size was determined based on egress studies conducted by other organizationsand the fact that persons evacuating a vessel in an emergency may be wearinglifejackets. The proposal is similar to requirements for emergency egressin the National Fire Protection Code Standard 101, ``Life Safety Code.''The National Transportation Safety Board recommended the establishmentof criterion for the number of persons that can safely exit through a standarddoor following the collision of two small passenger vessels, JACK W andJAMEY DOWNEY, in Lower New York Bay on June 22, 1987. Both vessels serveas passenger ferries and carry 149 and 105 passengers respectively. Since most existing vessels already comply with the proposed requirementfor minimum door size, the proposal is expected to be of minimal cost tothe small passenger vessel industry. However, the requirement is necessaryto ensure that on all small passenger vessels which have enclosed spacesfor a large number of persons, in which there is a significant chance ofcrowding and panic in an emergency, doors with a minimum width are providedfor escape. Proposed andSection; 177.500(m) prohibits vertical ladders, except on vesselsof not more than 65 feet in length, as a second means of escape from passengeraccommodation spaces, because of the varying physical conditions of passengers;vertical ladders are allowed for crew accommodation spaces and work spaces.Proposed andSection; 177.500(r) revises existing andSection; 177.15-1(b)(2)by requiring only one means of escape from a space with maximum dimensionsof less than 12 feet, under certain conditions, except that a verticalladder and deck scuttle are prohibited from serving as the only means ofescape from an accommodation space. Stairways would be allowed. Proposed andSection; 177.500(q) states that windows or windshields may beused as one of the two required means of escape only on vessels of notmore than 65 feet in length, and only when a person, exiting directly throughthe opening, would step onto a deck, platform, etc., and would not haveto go directly into the water. This incorporates present policy at manyCoast Guard field units and expands on the requirement of existing andSection;177.15-1(a). The additional requirements are proposed to allow an escapingperson to first be able to reach an open deck to evaluate the situationand take appropriate action before being forced into the water. However,on vessels without closed cabins, such as open boats, the only means ofescape would be to go directly overboard. On vessels of more than 65 feetin length, which often carry a large number of persons, there should be,and usually is, sufficient room to provide at least two normal, well markedexits which can be safely used by passengers of a variety of physical capabilities.The small passenger vessel industry is expected to incur only minimal costsas a result of the proposed revision to existing andSection; 177.15-1 becausemost vessels are already designed to comply with the proposed requirements.Proposed andSection; 177.510 is a new requirement for designated survivalcraft embarkation stations on vessels carrying more than 150 passengersor which have overnight accommodations for more than 49 passengers, andwhich are equipped with survival craft. Proposed andSection; 177.520 is a new requirement for muster stations onvessels carrying more than 150 passengers or with overnight accommodationsfor more than 49 people. Dependent upon the space available and the arrangementof the vessel, an embarkation station may also serve as a muster station.Muster stations must be protected by fire control boundaries in compliancewith proposed andSection; 177.430. A minimum area is required for musterstations so that passengers have sufficient room to don lifejackets withoutbeing overly crowded or panicking. The largest passenger accommodationspace is excluded from being a muster station to ensure that the minimumarea required for a muster station is available if a fire starts in thelargest accommodation space. Vessels with main vertical zone bulkheadswould be required to have muster stations in each zone so that a fire inone zone would not envelop all of the muster stations. The proposed requirements for designated embarkation stations and musterstations is similar to requirements that the Coast Guard is consideringincluding in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Subchapter W for largepassenger vessels. Designated muster stations and embarkation stationsare necessary to organize the orderly abandonment of large numbers of personsin survival craft. Muster stations also ensure that passengers have a protectedlocation to go to in the event of a fire and where they can wait for thefire to be extinguished, rescued, or embarkation into survival craft. Thestations would have to be indicated on plans for new vessels required tobe submitted by proposed andSection; 177.202, in a station bill if requiredby proposed andSection; 185.514, and in a passenger safety bill if requiredby proposed andSection; 185.515. The locations of the stations would alsohave to be announced in the passenger safety orientation required by proposedandSection; 185.506. <T3>Subpart F_Ventilation. </T3>Proposed andSection; 177.600(b) requiresthat all ventilation openings, for enclosed and partially enclosed spaces,must be located above the main deck and not penetrate the hull or bulwarkof a vessel. This requirement is proposed because water from rough seasor even wakes can easily flood through vent openings located below themain deck of a vessel, such as vent openings which penetrate the hull ofa vessel. Specific vent heights are not proposed due to the various arrangements,sizes, and routes of small passenger vessels. However, under proposed andSection;177.600(b) the OCMI may require closure devices to prevent the entry ofwater through any vent if the OCMI believes the location of the vent openingmay subject the vessel to flooding. The OCMI may allow an owner to raisethe height of the vent opening instead of requiring closure devices. Most OCMIs presently require that vent openings be arranged to minimizeflooding. Therefore, this proposal is not expected to impose any additionalcost on small passenger vessel owners. Proposed andSection; 177.600(c) requires that all interior spaces have apositive means for denying air to a space in the event of a fire. Thismay necessitate a damper to isolate the supply or weathertight covers,and a means of securing the fans in forced ventilation systems that supplya particular space. This proposal incorporates the requirements of 46 CFR72.05-50(i). Proposed andSection; 177.600 (e) and (f) revise the existing ventilationrequirement for enclosed accommodation spaces to require that such spacesbe mechanically ventilated unless it can be specifically shown that a naturalsystem will provide adequate ventilation in all ordinary weather conditions.However, all enclosed passenger spaces where smoking is allowed must bemechanically ventilated. Proposed andSection; 177.610 establishes ventilation duct requirements forvessels carrying more than 150 passengers. These requirements are designedto limit the passage of flame, smoke, and hot gases throughout the vessel'sventilated spaces, which minimizes the spread of the fire and allows moretime to fight the fire before the vessel has to be abandoned. Also, bylimiting the spread of flame, smoke, and hot gases, there is less riskto the health of the passengers and crew. The ventilation duct requirementsare based on those in Subchapter H and in NVIC 6-80 (``Guide to StructuralFire Protection Aboard Merchant Vessels''), suitably modified for smallpassenger vessels.<T3>Subpart G_Crew accommodations. </T3>Proposed andSection; 177.700 containsmore specific guidance than existing andSection; 177.25-1 does on when overnightaccommodations for crew members must be provided. As is present Coast Guardpolicy, the proposal requires that satisfactory overnight accommodationsmust be provided whenever a vessel is authorized to operate more than 12hours out of a 24 hour period without a crew change. <T3>Subpart H_Passenger Accommodations. </T3>Proposed andSection; 177.800contains specific requirements for all passenger accommodation spaces ona vessel. Proposed andSection; 177.810 contains specific requirements forovernight accommodation spaces for passengers. Passenger overnight accommodationspaces include cabins, staterooms, berthing areas, or other spaces, containingbeds or bunks allowing passengers to rest for extended periods. They mayinclude single person staterooms or large, multibunk berthing areas. Overnightaccommodation spaces do not include spaces which contain only seats, includingreclining seats, even if passengers may remain in them overnight. The existingregulations only contain specific requirements, other than for seat arrangements,for passenger lounge areas including overnight and day accommodations locatedbelow the main deck. However, due to the size, arrangement, and passengercapacity of most passenger spaces, the requirements applicable to spacesbelow the main deck should generally also be applicable to passenger spaceson or above the main deck. Many OCMIs presently apply most of the requirementsof existing andSection; 177.30-7 to all passenger spaces, and most vesselsalready comply with these requirements throughout the vessel. Consequently,the expected cost of this change is minimal. Proposed andSection; 177.840 contains the toilet requirements in existingandSection; 177.30-5, except that it allows the use of portable toilet facilitiesonly on vessels of not more than 65 feet in length carrying not more than49 passengers. <T3>Subpart I_Rails and Guards. </T3>Proposed andSection; 177.900 containsthe same requirements as existing andSection; 177.35-1 in regards to minimumrail height and locations with one notable exception. The minimum requiredrail height on ferries and vessels engaged in excursion operations is proposedto be reduced to 39\1/2\ inches. This is to align the small passenger vesselrequirement with that of the 1974 SOLAS Convention which recognizes 39\1/2\inches as the minimum height normally necessary for safety. Owners mayexperience a slight cost saving due to this proposed change. The proposedregulations on rails also contains specific guidance on the applicationof the minimum rail height and location requirements and incorporates existingCoast Guard policy. Excursion trips are defined to include, but not belimited to, sightseeing trips, dinner and party cruises, and overnightcruises. Rails are required to be higher on ferries and excursion vesselsbecause of the large number of passengers, greater percentage of children,and greater percentage of persons not familiar with boats, who are carriedon such vessels. The proposed rail regulations delete the requirement for evenly spacedrails since even spacing has been determined not to be a major safety consideration.However, the 12 inch maximum spacing in the existing regulations is retained.Proposed andSection; 177.900(a) contains a new performance standard, whichincorporates existing policy in the Coast Guard Marine Safety Manual, requiringthat rails be able to withstand the cumulative load of all persons whomay rely on them for support. Additionally, a requirement for stanchionslocated at a maximum distance apart of 7 feet is proposed. To avoid confusion, the proposed rules do not use the term ``sport fishing,''used in existing andSection; 177.35-1(d). Instead, the proposed rules allow30 inch rails to be installed in way of a person fishing from a fixed seatwho is secured in the seat by a restraining device. The reduced rail heightis only allowed in the vicinity of the fixed fishing seat. Higher rails,lifelines, etc., would be required to be put above the 30 inch rail whena person is not fishing from the fixed seat. Proposed andSection; 177.900(d) revises existing andSection; 177.35-1(e) bystating that, on a vessel where persons or cargo are routinely dischargedin a seaway, the OCMI may allow alternatives to the required rails onlywhere such rails would actually interfere with loading and unloading. Gatesor removable rails, chains, etc., must be provided for discharge operationswhenever possible. Vessels affected by this proposal may include dive boatsand pilot boats. <T3>Proposed Subpart J. </T3>Proposed Subpart J contains performance standardsfor windows not presently existing in Subchapter T. The proposed rulesrequire all glazing material to be made of material, such as safety glass,which will not break into dangerous fragments. These new requirements incorporatecurrent Coast Guard policy, provisions of the IMO Code for DynamicallySupported Craft, and shoreside building requirements. As this type of glassis generally used by the makers of marine windows and portlights and includedin the specifications for larger vessels, the cost of the proposed requirementwill be negligible. Windows and portholes must also be capable of withstandingthe maximum load to which they may be subjected. Window design pressuresmay be determined from a recognized standard, such as ISO Standard 3903-1977,or they may be certified by the window manufacturer. Because of the necessityfor good visibility, specific requirements are included for visibilityfrom windows at the operating station. A minimum light transmission ratingis also proposed to help ensure adequate visibility and control unlimiteduse of tinted windows. <ITAG tagnum="81">Part 178_Intact Stability and Seaworthiness </ITAG>Part 178 is a new part containing intact stability and seaworthiness requirementsfor small passenger vessels. This proposal moves most of the stabilityand seaworthiness requirements for small passenger vessels, which are presentlyin 46 CFR Subchapter S, into Subchapter T for the purpose of consolidatingmost regulations applicable to small passenger vessels in one inspectionsubchapter. The intact stability standards for small passenger vesselsthat are more than 65 feet in length, carrying more than 150 passengers,carrying 12 or more passengers on an international voyage, have more thanone deck above the bulkhead deck, exclusive of the pilot house, or whichare sailing vessels, would remain in 46 CFR Subchapter S to avoid duplicationof the requirements which are also applicable to vessels regulated by othersubchapters. In addition to moving regulations that pertain only to small passengervessels from Subchapter S, the proposed regulations revise some of theexisting regulations applicable to small passenger vessels to reflect currentCoast Guard policy and to correct some problems with the application ofexisting regulations. <T3>Section 178.320 Intact stability requirements. </T3>Proposed andSection;andSection;178.310 and 178.320 require that a simplified proof test be performed onall small passenger vessels, except those which must undergo a stabilitytest as specified in Subchapter S, unless specifically dispensed with bythe OCMI. Existing andSection; 171.030 requires that a simplified stabilityproof test need only be conducted on vessels of not more than 65 feet inlength carrying more than 49 passengers or on any other vessel whose stabilityis questioned by the OCMI. However, as allowed by existing andSection; 171.030(a)(2),many OCMIs now require all small passenger vessels to demonstrate thatthey have sufficient stability, either by the simplified proof test orby inclining and subsequent calculations. The proposed change emphasizesthat the stability of all small passenger vessels should be evaluated,not just those carrying more than 49 passengers or of more than 65 feetin length, due to the variety of hull forms and outfitting found on smallpassenger vessels today. The estimated cost of a simplified stability prooftest is approximately $200 per vessel. <T3>Section 178.340 Intact stability standards for pontoon vessels in protectedwaters. </T3>Proposed andSection; 178.340 incorporates policy currently inthe Coast Guard Marine Safety Manual which provides a simplified meansof testing the intact stability of pontoon vessels of not more than 65feet in length, carrying not more than 150 passengers, and operating inprotected waters. The simplified test in existing regulations is only applicableto monohull vessels. <T3>Section 178.450 Calculation of Drainage Area. </T3>Proposed andSection;178.450 revises the existing drainage requirements for both well deck andcockpit vessels contained in 46 CFR Subchapter S and contains a requireddrainage area formula that accounts for: (1) The volume susceptible to entraining water; (2) The height of the deck above the waterline; (3) The operating area; and (4) The area of the weathertight superstructure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The proposed regulation still distinguishes between cockpit vesselsthat operate on protected or partially protected waters and other vessels.The cockpit vessel on protected waters is considered immune to taking ``greenwater'' over the side and needs only to be able to drain rain and spray.However, because a vessel on partially protected waters may periodicallyexperience sea conditions similar to those found on exposed waters, commentsare requested on the possible need for a cockpit vessel on partially protectedwaters to have the same drainage area proposed for a vessel on exposedwaters. There have been many complaints from small passenger vessel owners andarchitects over the years about the existing drainage area requirementsfor cockpit and well deck vessels. The existing drainage area requirementfor well deck vessels, being directly proportional to the length and heightof the bulwark, fails to take into account the deck volume susceptibleto entraining water or the effect of deck houses on free surface area.The difference between a well deck vessel and a cockpit vessel in the existingrules can be a matter of inches of deck length and minimal in the volumesusceptible to entraining water, yet the freeing port/scupper areas requiredfor each type of vessel can be several hundred percent different. The cost of this proposed drainage area requirement change is considerednegligible because the amount of drainage required can be incorporatedinto the design and construction of a new vessel. The benefit of the proposedchange is that deck drainage will more accurately reflect the amount ofwater that may be entrained on a vessel. <T3>Section 178.510 Fixed ballast. </T3>Proposed andSection; 178.510 containsrequirements concerning ballast installed to comply with stability regulations.The proposal incorporates the requirements of andSection; 170.235 of SubchapterS and includes a new requirement that solid ballast installed forward ofthe collision bulkhead be installed and arranged to prevent damage to thecollision bulkhead during a collision. The proposal requires that ballast, installed to meet stability requirements,be both solid and fixed, since such ballast provides a permanent and verifiablequantity of ballast. The stability of a vessel can be more easily and safelymaintained with solid fixed ballast than with liquid ballast. However,solid ballast can pose a danger if it is stowed forward of the collisionbulkhead in a manner that may cause the collision bulkhead to fail in acollision, an example of which would be concrete forming a solid structuralconnection between the stem of a vessel and its collision bulkhead.<ITAG tagnum="81">Part 179-Subdivision, Damage Stability, and Watertight Integrity </ITAG>Part 179 is a new part containing proposed subdivision, damage stability,and watertight integrity requirements for small passenger vessels. Thisproposed rule moves the applicable existing subdivision, damage stability,and watertight integrity requirements of 46 CFR Subchapter S into SubchapterT. <T3>Sections 179.210 and 179.212 Watertight bulkhead requirements. </T3>ProposedandSection;andSection; 179.210 and 179.212 contain the existing requirementsfor watertight bulkheads on small passenger vessels. Due to the inherenthazards of operating a vessel, and the need to protect passengers, crew,cargo, and the vessel itself, all vessels need some degree of floodingprotection. Consideration was given to requiring collision bulkheads onvessels not presently required to have them and to increasing subdivisionrequirements. Due to the relatively high cost of providing a one compartmentstandard of subdivision or sufficient foam flotation on vessels of notmore than 65 feet in length and carrying not more than 49 passengers, theCoast Guard has not included any increase in the subdivision requirementsin the proposed rules. Available casualty history does not appear to justifythe increase in cost. However, comments are requested on the possibilityof extending the watertight bulkhead and subdivision requirements to vesselsnot presently required to comply with such requirements. <T3>Section 179.310(b)(1). </T3>Proposed andSection; 179.310(b)(1) containsa specific requirement for the location of a collision bulkhead with abulbous bow which comprises more than 2 percent of the underwater volumeof the vessel. Two percent of the underwater volume is being proposed asa reasonable limit, to exclude small projections which do not contributesignificantly to the overall buoyancy. This proposal also revises the definitionof length for the purposes of Part 179 so that large underwater projectionsforward of the forward perpendicular or aft of the aft perpendicular areconsidered in locating watertight bulkheads. These proposed changes considerthe effects that underwater projections such as bulbous bows have on damagestability. The current regulations do not address such projections. <T3>Section 179.330 Watertight doors. </T3>Proposed andSection; 179.330 expandsthe existing regulations in 46 CFR Subchapter S to clarify the Coast Guard'spolicy on watertight doors, particularly as to allowable location. Thisproposed section formalizes policy which allows watertight doors in machineryspace bulkheads where it can be reasonably assumed that such doors willbe kept closed, and which requires special approval by the Commandant innon-machinery spacebulkheads. Watertight doors in subdivision bulkheadspresent a particular hazard on small passenger vessels because of the relativelysmall size of compartments and the rapidity with which they can flood.The noise and heat associated with machinery provides a natural incentiveto keep doors closed. This proposed regulation imposes no additional costson small passenger vessels. <T3>Section 179.340 Trunks. </T3>Proposed andSection; 179.340 incorporatesrequirements for trunks on large passenger vessels which are currentlyapplied to vessels of more than 65 feet in length or carrying more than150 passengers. For the purposes of proposed Part 179, a trunk is a large,enclosed passageway through any deck or bulkhead of a vessel, which wouldinclude passageways referred to as tunnels on certain vessels. This proposedregulation is necessary because some existing small passenger vessels havetrunks and the number of small passenger vessels built with trunks is expectedto increase. <T3>Section 179.360 Watertight integrity.</T3> Proposed andSection; 179.360expands the existing regulations in 46 CFR Subchapter S to clarify therequirements for weathertight and watertight doors and hatches, particularlyto prevent entrapping water within enclosed superstructures. The proposedregulation does not impose any additional cost and will, by defining whichopenings must be watertight or weathertight, lead to fewer misconceptionsabout what is required for watertight integrity. The Coast Guard has received general comments on the tripping hazard posedby the coaming required by andSection; 171.124 of Subchapter S and whichis included in proposed andSection; 179.360. The coamings are required toprevent water on a deck from flowing into the superstructure or hull ofa vessel, where the water would cause a reduction in stability. Even vesselsoperating on protected waters can have water on deck from the wake of othervessels. The Coast Guard is considering revising the coaming requirement. Specificcomments are requested on the coaming requirement and information on accidentscaused by coamings. Comments should also address the risk of downfloodingon a vessel and if the elimination or reduction in height of required coamingswould effect that risk. <ITAG tagnum="81">Part 180-Lifesaving Appliances and Arrangements </ITAG><T3>Organization of Part 180. </T3>The lifesaving equipment requirementsare proposed as a completely revised Part 180. The structure of proposedPart 180 is designed to parallel a new functional subchapter being developedunder Coast Guard Docket 84-069, 46 CFR Subchapter W (Part 199). SubchapterW will contain lifesaving equipment requirements for large inspected vessels.This parallel structure will allow for easy comparison of the requirementsfor both types of vessels. For example, the requirements for EmergencyPosition Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs) are in andSection; 180.64 of thisproposal. EPIRB requirements in Subchapter W will be in proposed andSection;199.64. Requirements for lifejackets are in andSection; 180.71 of this proposal,and will be in proposed andSection; 199.71 of Subchapter W. The proposed regulations contain references to Subchapter W in severalplaces including andSection;andSection; 176.808, 180.10, 180.150, 180.175(g),and 180.210(c). Requirements similar to those intended to be publishedin the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Subchapter W are presently containedin Part 75 (Lifesaving Equipment) of Subchapter H. Subchapter H containsthe regulations for vessels of at least 100 gross tons carrying passengers.If the final rules for Subchapter W are not published prior to publicationof the final rules under this docket, the Coast Guard intends to replacethe references to Subchapter W contained in this proposal with referencesto Subchapter H as an interim measure. <T3>Section 180.10 ``Very large'' small passenger vessels with overnightaccommodations for more than 49 passengers and small passenger vesselson international voyages. </T3>As in other parts proposed in this notice,small passenger vessels on international voyages and ``very large'' smallpassenger vessels with overnight accommodations for more than 49 passengerswould have to meet the requirements for large passenger vessels. Theserequirements are presently located in Subchapter H and will be proposedfor inclusion in Subchapter W. The International Convention on the Safetyof Life at Sea, 1974, (SOLAS) mandates the increased standards for smallpassenger vessels on international voyages. Small passenger vessels oninternational voyages must presently comply with SOLAS lifesaving equipmentregulations which parallel the regulations of Subchapter H. Even though ``very large'' small passenger vessels with overnight accommodationsfor more than 49 passengers may measure at a gross tonnage of less than100, they are not of the type initially contemplated as being regulatedunder Subchapter T. They are more closely related to the vessels and servicescovered under proposed Subchapter W. This proposed regulation is not asignificant change since ``very large'' small passenger vessels with overnightaccommodations for more than 50 passengers are usually required to complywith Subchapter H, in accordance with NVIC 11-83. <T3>Section 180.15 Applicability to existing vessels. </T3>The proposedregulations in Part 180, except for andSection;andSection; 180.78(a)(4) and180.210, would apply to all existing small passenger vessels. Existingvessels must comply with the following new requirements for lifesavingequipment when applicable for the size and route of the vessel: Inflatablesurvival craft, survival craft stowage and launching requirements, satelliteEPIRBs (including on vessels operating within 20 miles of a harbor of saferefuge), and the elimination of the use of combination flares. ProposedandSection; 180.15 contains phase-in periods for these new requirements applicableto existing vessels. Five years after the effective date of the rules, vessels older than 10years on that date would have to comply with the new survival craft requirements.Vessels between 5 and 10 years old would have to comply by the time thevessel reaches the tenth anniversary of its keel-laying date. The purposeof this phase-in period is to spread the demand for new liferafts and inflatablebuoyant apparatus over several years, so that manufacturers can producethe equipment without over-burdening their production capabilities. Thephase-in plan also results in older vessels being equipped with improvedlifesaving equipment first. An informal analysis of casualties indicatesthat older small passenger vessels are more likely to be involved in casualtiesthan newer vessels. <T3>Section 180.64 EPIRBs. </T3>For vessels in ocean or coastwise route,the regulations proposed in andSection; 180.64 would require the use of FederalCommunications Commission (FCC) Type Accepted float-free EPIRBs operatingon the dedicated satellite frequency of 406.025 MHz. The present regulationsrequire Class A EPIRBs operating on 121.5/243 MHz, and allow an exemptionfor vessels operating within 20 miles of a harbor of safe refuge. The eliminationof the 20 mile exemption is proposed since rapid alerting and locationof vessels in distress in this region is as necessary as it is furtherout at sea. The 406 MHz satellite EPIRB not only provides improved alertingand locating over conventional EPIRBs operating on 121.5/243 MHz, but alsoavoids most of the false alarm problems on those frequencies. Final rulespermitting the manufacture and sale of such beacons have been developedby the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and are expected to be publishedsoon in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. These beacons should be readily available in1989. The approximate cost of such beacons is presently $1450.00. However,as availability and demand increases the price is expected to decrease.The JOAN LaRIE III casualty is an example of why the exemption for vesselsoperating within 20 miles of a harbor of safe refuge is being proposedfor elimination. The JOAN LaRIE III was approximately 8.5 nautical milesoffshore when it suddenly capsized. No distress message was sent over theVHF-FM radiotelephone and there was apparently no EPIRB on board. A rescueoperation was started immediately only because the sudden disappearanceof the vessel was noted on the radar of a Brazilian freighter which happenedto be close by and investigated. Had it not been for the proximity of thefreighter, it might have been several more hours before a search and rescueoperation was started. Other casualties, including the COMET casualty,also indicate the need for EPIRBs on all coastwise and ocean route vessels.The survivors from the COMET were found by a passing yacht 4\1/2\ hoursafter the vessel sank. Both the NTSB and a Coast Guard Marine Board ofInvestigation have recommended elimination of the exemption to the EPIRBrequirement for vessels operating within 20 miles of a harbor of safe refuge.The Coast Guard recognizes that many owners and operators have 121.5/243MHz EPIRBs in compliance with the present regulations, and that this equipmenthas a long service life. Therefore, proposed andSection; 180.15(c) wouldallow 121.5/243 MHz Class A (float-free) EPIRBs that are installed on orbefore the effective date of the final rules to be carried for about 6years. This Class A EPIRB phase-out period is identical to the phase-outperiod included in the final rule, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of August 17, 1988 (53 FR 31004), for the installationof EPIRBs on fishing vessels, fish processing, and fish tender vessels.The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the installation of EPIRBs on fishingvessels, fish processing, and fish tender vessels, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 3, 1987 (52 FR 33448), proposeda phase-out period of 10 years; however comments supported a shorter period.Although conventional 121.5/243 MHz Class A EPIRBs would be acceptablefor the proposed 6 year phase-out period, there are a number of problemswith these EPIRBs. The 121.5/243 MHz system has a serious false alarm problem.Although ``COSPAS/SARSAT'' search and rescue satellites are designed toreceive 121.5 MHz signals, 121.5/243 MHz EPIRBs are not designed as ``satelliteEPIRBs'' and their coverage area and alert and locate ability is significantlyinferior to that of the 406 MHz satellite EPIRB. Comments are requestedas to whether a shorter phase-in period should be required for small passengervessels. <T3>Section 180.68 Distress flares.</T3> Proposed andSection; 180.68 containssome changes to the present requirements for flares in andSection; 180.35.As in the existing regulations, small passenger vessels on ocean, coastwise,or Great Lakes routes would be required to carry 12 distress flares. However,the combination flare and smoke signals allowed by existing andSection; 180.35-5(a)(2),and approved under 46 CFR Subpart 160.023, would no longer be acceptableto meet the requirements for distress flares. Existing combination signalscould continue to be used until their expiration dates have been passed.These signals have significantly lower flare and smoke emission time thanthe other flares listed in proposed andSection; 180.68. In addition, theyhave been found to eject hot slag as they burn, which can be a minor hazard.Hand flares approved under 46 CFR Subpart 160.021 must pass a test in whichthey are burned over liquid heptane without igniting the heptane. Flaresapproved using this test have a reduced likelihood of starting a fire dueto hot dripping slag. A small passenger vessel on an ocean or coastwise route would be requiredto have six hand held red flares and six orange smoke signals, as allowedby the existing regulations, or 12 rocket parachute flares as requiredon a passenger vessel an ocean or coastwise route by existing SubchapterH and as will be proposed in Subchapter W. A small passenger vessel ona Great Lakes route would be required to have six hand held red flaresand six orange smoke signals, 12 rocket parachute flares, or 12 hand heldred flares as required on a passenger vessel on a Great Lakes route byexisting Subchapter H and as will be proposed in Subchapter W. The Coast Guard received one comment under CGD 021-85 that vessels on riverroutes should not be required to carry flares. Vessels on river routesoften operate in unpopulated areas where flares may be needed to signalfor help in an emergency. However, under this proposal, small passengervessels on lakes, bays, and sounds or rivers would only be required tohave six flares because of the increased chance of such vessels being spottedfrom shore within a short time period and because they are more accessibleto rescue facilities compared to vessels on coastwise or ocean routes.The proposed changes would result in a minor cost saving to vessels onlakes, bays, and sounds and river routes due to the decreased number offlares required. <T3>Section 180.71 Lifejackets.</T3> In this proposal, the commonly usedterm ``lifejacket'' replaces the term ``life preserver'' used in existingSubchapter T. The term ``lifejacket'' will also be used in Subchapter W.The Coast Guard intends to change the references to life preservers in46 CFR Subchapter Q, Subparts 160.002, 160.005, and 160.055, to life jackets.Proposed andSection; 180.71(b) would require all vessels carrying passengersto carry a number of child-size lifejackets equal to at least 10% of thenumber of passengers permitted on board, or such greater number as necessaryto provide a lifejacket for each person smaller than the lower size limitof the adult lifejackets. This proposed regulation would state the requirementfor child-size life preservers more clearly than in existing SubchapterT. Proposed andSection; 180.71(b) would permit vessels to omit the child-sizelifejackets if the vessel does not carry persons smaller than the lowersize limit of the adult lifejackets. This proposal means that child-sizelifejackets well in excess of 10% of the total number of passengers permittedon board, may be required for a vessel that carries a large number of childrenon infrequent occasions, or for a vessel that does not normally monitorthe number of children carried. The proposed regulation is a clarification of present requirements forsmall passenger vessels. Present regulations in andSection; 180.25-5(a) require``an approved adult type life preserver for each person carried. In addition,* * * a number of approved life preservers suitable for children equalto at least 10 percent of the total number of persons carried''. The CoastGuard interprets this regulation as requiring a child-size life preserverfor each child carried, even if more than 10% of the persons on board arechildren. Adult lifejackets are not necessarily suitable for any and all children.If the lifejacket is too big for a child, it may come off easily, it mayunacceptably hinder the ability of the child to climb steps or otherwisemaneuver, or its buoyancy may be too low on the child's body causing thechild to float with the head under water. The Coast Guard has worked onthe problem by testing some adult lifejackets on children. Some were foundto be satisfactory for children over 75 pounds. Recognizing that future``adult universal'' size lifejackets may be approved for persons smallerthan 90 pounds, the regulations proposed in this notice refer to the lowersize limit of the lifejacket. Comments on the issue of lifejackets for children are invited. Commentssuggesting alternative approaches should consider the need to provide appropriateflotation devices for all children carried, as well as the problems thatare experienced by operators in complying with the requirement. <T3>Section 180.78 Stowage of lifejackets.</T3> Proposed andSection; 180.78(a)(4)would require lifejackets stowed more than 7 feet above the deck to havea means for quick release, capable of operation by a person standing onthe deck. This is a requirement of the present regulations for large passengervessels (46 CFR 75.40-20(b)) and also in proposed Subchapter W, but itdoes not now appear in Part 180. Existing andSection; 180.25-10(a) requireslifejackets to be stowed in places convenient to the persons on board.No significant cost increase is expected to result from this proposed rulebecause vessels with lifejacket stowage above 7 feet would probably alreadyhave to have a means for release by a person on deck in order to meet thepresent ``convenient'' standard. <T3>Section 180.110 Embarkation ladders.</T3> Proposed andSection; 180.110requires an embarkation ladder at embarkation stations if the distancefrom the embarkation deck to the vessel's lightest operating waterlineis more than 10 feet. This is expected to affect only a very small numberof vessels with high freeboards. The ladder is necessary to safely getfrom the embarkation deck to the water level on high freeboard vessels.The approximate cost of a satisfactory embarkation ladder is $900. Thisproposal is similar to a requirement in proposed Subchapter W for largeinspected vessels. <T3>Section 180.130 Survival craft stowage.</T3> Under proposed andSection;180.130(a), each survival craft would have to be stowed in an automaticfloat-free launching arrangement so that if a vessel sinks or capsizesthe survival craft would float off its stowage location. Existing regulationsdo not require a float-free arrangement for life floats and buoyant apparatuson a small passenger vessel. Existing Subpart 180.20 requires each lifefloat and buoyant apparatus to be held in place either by lashings whichcan be easily released, or by a hydrostatic release unit in a float-freearrangement. If lashings are used, the survival craft would probably remainon the vessel if the vessel suddenly capsized or sank. Other inspection subchapters require float-free launching arrangementsfor inflatable survival craft. Additionally, when inflatable survival craftare installed aboard small passenger vessels, they are normally installedin a float-free arrangement. However, existing Part 180 does not specifythe method of stowing inflatable survival craft since they are not nowrequired to be carried on small passenger vessels. Navigation and VesselInspection Circular (NVIC) 1-83 (Painters for Life Floats and Buoyant Apparatus)and NVIC 4-86 (Hydraulic Release Units for Liferafts, Life Floats, andBuoyant Apparatus, and Alternate Float-Free Arrangement) strongly recommendthat lifefloats and buoyant apparatus be stowed in float-free arrangements.A review of casualties, including the JOAN LA RIE II, DIXIE LEE II, PEARLC, and FISH-N-FOOL, resulted in the determination that float-free arrangementsare necessary for all survival craft. A greater loss of life would probablyhave occurred if survival craft had not floated free when the cited vesselscapsized. The proposed float-free requirement could be complied with by the use ofan approved hydrostatic release unit, a crib made of pipe stanchions, orsimilar arrangements. A hydrostatic release unit must be approved in accordancewith the requirements of 46 CFR Subpart 160.062. Subpart 160.062 describesthe procedures for the approval of hydraulic releases. Hydrostatic releaseunit is the commonly used term for a hydraulic release. The term hydrostaticrelease unit will be used in Subchapter W, and the Coast Guard intendsto use the more common term in a revision to Subpart 160.062. Under proposed andSection; 180.130(c), with the exception of survival craftof not more than 200 pounds in weight, a survival craft must not requirelifting from its stowed position in order to be launched. This proposalis a result of recommendations made following investigations of the MERRYJANE, FINALISTA 100, and CAPT. JIM casualties where persons aboard thesevessels had difficulty launching survival craft due to the weight of thecraft. Existing andSection; 180.20-1(a)(6) presently limits the weight ofsurvival craft to 400 pounds. This weight appears excessive based on thecited casualties. An approved survival craft heavier than 200 pounds could be stowed aboarda vessel so that it could be launched by using davits or other arrangementswhich would allow the sliding or dropping of the craft into the water withouthaving to be lifted by persons. Comments are specifically requested on whether or not any lifting shouldbe permitted to launch a survival craft of even as much as 200 pounds.As many as 3 persons could be needed to lift a survival craft this heavydue to the shape of some craft. A more realistic limitation on the weightof a survival craft which does not need mechanical assistance for launchingmay be 100 pounds.The cost to a vessel owner of providing survival craft stowage which complieswith proposed andSection; 180.130 will vary depending on the type of survivalcraft and the arrangement of a vessel. Costs will include both the stowagearrangement and any necessary local strengthening of decks or other modifications.The owners of fifty percent of the vessels required to have survival craftare expected to incur a cost of approximately $500 per vessel to comply.The cost for most other vessels to comply is expected to be less than $500.<T3>Section 180.150 Survival craft launching arrangements. </T3>ProposedandSection; 180.150 would require a launching appliance for each survivalcraft whose embarkation station is located on a deck at least 15 feet abovethe waterline, or which is boarded prior to being placed in the water.A launching appliance for an inflatable liferaft or inflatable buoyantapparatus could be a davit and winch, an inflatable escape slide, or anythingelse approved as an equivalent by the Commandant to safely and efficientlytransport survivors from the vessel and into the survival craft in thewater. The proposed requirement is similar to one in existing SubchapterH and which will be proposed for inclusion in Subchapter W. The requirement for survival craft launching appliances will not applyto most small passenger vessels because the embarkation deck on most vesselsis close to the water. Most vessels can be properly designed and arrangedto avoid having to install launching appliances. However, the owner ofone of the few small passenger vessels, required to have launching appliancesby the proposed regulations, is expected to incur a cost of approximately$20,000 to comply with proposed andSection; 180.150 for a group of six davit-launchedliferafts. <T3>Subpart E_Survival craft. </T3>Revised survival craft requirementsare proposed in Subpart E of Part 180 (andSection;andSection; 180.200 through180.210). Under andSection; 180.202, each small passenger vessel on an oceansroute except when operating in certain areas at specified times of theyear, would be required to have inflatable liferafts of an aggregate capacitywhich will accommodate the total number of persons permitted on board.The section would allow life floats to be substituted for inflatable liferaftsin certain areas at the indicated times of the year. These ocean areasand times of the year have been chosen to include waters where the meanlow water temperature for each month approximately equals or exceeds 59anddegrees;F (15 anddegrees;C). The boundaries for these areas have been chosento correspond with established boundaries for Coast Guard Marine InspectionZones, insofar as is possible, along with some common geographic breakpointsincluded in Certificate of Inspection route endorsements. Marine InspectionZone boundaries are established under 33 CFR Part 3. Comments are specificallyrequested on the appropriateness of the proposed boundaries for reducedsurvival craft. The present regulations require small passenger vessels on an ocean routeto carry sufficient life floats for all persons on board. The shortcomingsof the present regulations are that they do not provide adequate survivalequipment in cold water. Life floats only provide something for personsin the water to hang on to. A few people may be able to stand on the platformin the middle of the life float, and be immersed approximately waist-deep.No protection is provided for wind and waves. Search and rescue data suggestthat unprotected persons in the water will start to die of immersion hypothermiaor its complications after two hours in 59 anddegrees;F (15 anddegrees;C) water.Seven or eight hours is about the maximum expected survival time in watersof this temperature. Expected survival times drop in lower water temperatures.Even with adequate notification, rescue operations in ocean waters canextend for several hours, depending upon how close rescue resources are.Liferafts provide out-of-the-water flotation and protection from wind andwaves for survivors of casualties in cold and rough waters, thereby reducingdeaths due to immersion hypothermia and drowning. Under a proposal submitted as a result of CGD 085-21, the National MarineManufacturers Association recommended that vessels carrying not more than12 passengers operating on an inland or coastwise route, which have positivebuoyancy when fully flooded or swamped, not be required to have survivalcraft. Although persons could hold onto a capsized vessel or stay in aflooded vessel which has positive buoyancy, such a vessel would not provideprotection from wind, waves, and hypothermia. Additionally, a vessel withpositive buoyancy may still need survival craft in the event that a firecaused the abandonment of the vessel. The U.S. Lifesaving Manufacturers Association (USLMA) commented under CGD85-021 that all small passenger vessels should be required to carry survivalcraft which will allow all persons permitted aboard a vessel to stay outof the water. The Coast Guard does agree with the USLMA's concern thatpersons be protected from hypothermia, and the proposed regulations addressthat concern while also considering the cost of such regulations on thesmall passenger vessel industry and the public. The ideal situation wouldbe to have such survival craft on all vessels, but it is not economicallyfeasible to do so. Comments on alternatives to inflatable liferafts and buoyant apparatuswhich would protect persons from hypothermia are specifically requested.Under proposed andSection; 180.204, each vessel in coastwise or Great Lakesservice would be required to have inflatable buoyant apparatus of an aggregatecapacity which will accommodate the total number of persons permitted onboard. The section would allow for substitution of buoyant apparatus forthe inflatable buoyant apparatus in certain areas at the indicated timesof the year. Inflatable buoyant apparatus are similar to inflatable liferafts,except that they have no canopy, and carry only a limited amount of survivalequipment. This makes them less expensive than inflatable liferafts foroperators to buy and maintain. They provide out-of-the-water flotationfor survivors, but the lack of a canopy means that there is no protectionfrom wind and waves. Nevertheless, these devices should be adequate forvessels on coastwise or Great Lakes voyages which will typically be closerthan ocean voyage vessels to other vessels and shore-based rescue facilities.As for ocean voyage vessels, coastwise vessels may substitute a deviceof lesser lifesaving capabilities in warmer waters. For coastwise voyages,this is the (rigid) buoyant apparatus, a device similar to a life float,but lacking the life float's platform for supporting survivors partiallyout of the water. As for ocean voyage vessels, the times and places forthe substitution are based on a 59 anddegrees;F (15 anddegrees;C) mean lowwater temperature. The boundaries extend further north in the summer andfall months, since coastal waters are warmer than open ocean waters inthese months. The present regulations for coastwise vessels require buoyant apparatusfor all persons on board. Only 50% capacity is required on the Great Lakesor on a coastwise voyage within 20 miles of a harbor of safe refuge. TheOCMI may authorize carriage of fewer buoyant apparatus if the vessel operateswithin one mile of shore.The proposed regulations for ocean, coastwise or Great Lakes voyages wouldprovide out-of-the-water flotation for survivors of casualties in coldand rough waters, thereby reducing deaths due to immersion hypothermia.The change is consistent with findings of shortcomings of survival craftin National Transportation Safety Board and Coast Guard investigationsof casualties involving the FISH-N-FOOL, PILGRIM BELLE, COMET, YANKEE,SAN MATEO, JOAN LaRIE III, DIXIE LEE II, and PEARL C. Under proposed andSection;andSection; 180.206 and 180.208, each vessel carryingmore than 150 passengers in lakes, bays, and sounds service or in riverservice must be provided with inflatable buoyant apparatus of an aggregatecapacity which will accommodate the total number of persons permitted onboard, during those periods of the year when the normal temperature ofthe water is less than 59anddegrees; F (15anddegrees; C) in the area wherethe vessel operates. Reductions would be allowed for vessels operatingin warmer waters, for vessels carrying no more than 150 passengers, andfor vessels operating within one mile of shore. Proposed andSection;andSection;180.206 and 180.208 are intended to fulfill an obligation under a provisionin the 1984 Coast Guard Authorization Act which required the Secretaryof Transportation to proceed vigorously with efforts to develop improvedlifesaving equipment for use on passenger ferries (Pub. L. 98-557). Ferriesare typically large capacity vessels. As proposed, the requirement wouldnot be restricted to ferries. Other vessels of a similar capacity shouldbe required to meet similar requirements, even if they are not in ferryservice. In order to certificate small passenger vessels in Great Lakes service,lakes, bays, and sounds service, or in river service, each OCMI would establishthe times of the year when the waters within the OCMI's zone normally equalor exceed 59anddegrees; F (15anddegrees; C). These determinations would bebased on whatever reliable hydrographic data is available for those waters.There is no intent to imply the need to continuously monitor actual watertemperatures in order to comply with this proposal.In the current regulations, 46 CFR 180.10-30(b) provides for substitutionof dinghies, dories, skiffs, etc. for primary lifesaving equipment (buoyantapparatus or life floats). This substitution would continue to be permittedunder proposed andSection; 180.200(b), if the boat meets the safe loadingand flotation requirements which the Coast Guard currently requires forrecreational boats. Because such boats would not provide survival platformsequivalent to inflatable life rafts or inflatable buoyant apparatus, substitutionfor inflatable life rafts or inflatable buoyant apparatus would not bepermitted. The proposed regulations would not continue to permit up to two ring lifebuoys to be substituted for a similar capacity in buoyant apparatus andlife floats. The substitution now appears in 46 CFR 180.10-30(d). Underthe ``grandfather clause'' in proposed andSection; 180.15(a), existing vesselscould continue to use substituted ring life buoys until they are requiredto retrofit survival craft under proposed andSection; 180.15(b)(1). Approximate cost for survival craft at the present time are as follows:From $3500 for a 6 person inflatable liferaft to $6,000 for a 25 personinflatable liferaft; from $4500 for a 16 person inflatable buoyant apparatusto $5800 for a 45 person inflatable buoyant apparatus; from $500 for a6 person lifefloat to $1240 for a 22 person lifefloat; from $480 for a10 person buoyant apparatus to $1200 for a 22 person buoyant apparatus.The required annual servicing cost for inflatable liferafts is approximately$20 per person capacity of the raft, and the servicing cost for inflatablebuoyant apparatus is approximately $10 per person capacity. <T3>Section 180.210 Rescue boats. </T3>Proposed andSection; 180.210 wouldrequire a rescue boat on a small passenger vessel of more than 65 feetin length unless the OCMI determines that the vessel meets three specificperformance criteria. Existing andSection; 180.10-35 requires a rescue boaton a vessel of more than 65 feet in length unless the OCMI determines thatthe vessel is of such design and operating characteristics that the vesselprovides a satisfactory rescue platform. The proposed regulation includesmore specific performance standards, compared to the existing regulations,as to when the design and operating characteristics of a vessel might makea rescue boat unnecessary. An OCMI may consider a rescue boat unnecessaryon a vessel of more than 65 feet in length if: (1) The vessel can be easily maneuvered alongside a person in the water;(2) The vessel has a low freeboard, a platform (including a satisfactoryportable platform) or a similar arrangement so that the crew can pull theperson from the water; and (3) The master or mate can easily see the person in the water from theoperating station while the vessel approaches the person. The proposed regulation also authorizes the OCMI to require a rescue boaton a vessel of not more than 65 feet in length which can not satisfactorilyserve as a rescue platform. The existing requirement for a rescue boatonly applies to a vessel of more than 65 feet in length. This change wouldgive the OCMI the option to require a rescue boat on the few vessels ofnot more than 65 feet in length that, even with their small size, are notadequately arranged or maneuverable to serve as a rescue platform, or whichare involved in operations which would prevent the rapid recovery of aperson in the water. An example of a small vessel which may need a rescueboat is a dive vessel that cannot get underway to assist a passenger whohad entered the water for diving or snorkeling and cannot return to thevessel. Five fatalities involving diving accidents occurred from 1983 through1987, in one marine inspection zone alone, which may have been preventedby the use of a rescue boat. The victims had been transported to the divesite by small passenger vessels of not more than 65 feet in length. Rescue boats on vessels of more than 65 feet in length would be requiredto be installed and arranged as will be proposed in Subchapter W. The requirementsin proposed Subchapter W primarily incorporate the regulations on rescueboats contained in the International Convention for the Safety of Lifeat Sea, 1974. Under this proposal, approved inflatable boats could be usedas rescue boats. Rescue boats on vessels of not more than 65 feet in lengthwould have to be satisfactory to the cognizant OCMI. This would allow theOCMI to consider the size, arrangement, and operation of such smaller vesselswhen requiring a suitable rescue boat.<ITAG tagnum="81">Part 181_Fire Protection Equipment </ITAG><T3>Subpart A_General Provisions. </T3>The regulations proposed in thispart would not apply to existing vessels except as noted in andSection; 181.115.Proposed andSection; 181.115(b) requires that an existing vessel with a hullor machinery space boundary bulkhead composed of or sheathed on the interiorin fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) must comply with proposed andSection; 181.400,which contains requirements for fixed gas fire extinguishing systems andfire detecting systems. A separate fire detecting system would not be requiredif a fixed gas extinguishing system capable of automatic discharge uponheat detection is installed. Such systems can be easily installed on mostFRP small passenger vessels. The only other small passenger vessels, in addition to those composed ofFRP, which would be required to have fixed gas extinguishing systems arevessels with gasoline machinery or with paint lockers, which are presentlyrequired to have such systems by existing andSection; 181.20-1. The discussion in the preamble of proposed Subpart D of Part 181 includesthe general need for fixed gas fire extinguishing systems and fire detectingsystems. Because of the significant benefit of having such systems, considerationwas given to requiring fixed gas fire extinguishing systems and fire detectingsystems on all existing vessels. However, retrofitting all existing vesselswould have a substantial cost impact on the small passenger vessel industry.Casualty data was therefore analyzed to see which existing vessels havethe greatest need for fixed systems. This analysis showed FRP small passengervessels suffered a disproportionate share of the number of and monetarydamage from fires. Thirty-four percent of all machinery space fires onsmall passenger vessels, from 1981 through 1986, occurred on FRP vesselsalthough FRP vessels comprise only 20 percent of the small passenger vesselfleet. That is a fleet percentage to fire percentage ratio of 1.7:1. Incomparison, the fleet percentage to fire percentage ratio for wooden smallpassenger vessels is 1.25:1. The ratios for vessels made of steel or aluminumare much lower. Only FRP small passenger vessels would be required to havefixed gas fire protection systems and fire detecting systems because therisk of such vessels having machinery space fires, and hence the cost-benefitratio, is significantly greater than for vessels composed of other materials.Proposed andSection; 181.115(c) requires that existing vessels, which usegasoline or other fuels having a flash point of 110anddegrees;F or lower,comply with the requirement of proposed andSection; 181.400(j) to installa flammable vapor detection system. The general need for such systems isexplained in the discussion in the preamble of proposed Subpart D of Part181. Existing small passenger vessels would not have to install fixed gas extinguishingsystems, fire detecting systems, or flammable vapor detection systems until3 years after the effective date of the final rules. <T3>Subpart C_Fire Main System. </T3>Proposed andSection; 181.300 increasesthe existing required flow rate from the fire pump on a vessel of morethan 65 feet in length from 50 gallons per minute (gpm) at 60 psi at thepump outlet to 80 gpm at 50 psi delivered simultaneously at the two highesthydrants on the vessel. The new requirements are considered to better providefor a vessel's needs for fire fighting. The simultaneous flow is requiredto ensure that sufficient coverage can be provided from a lead hose andbackup hose when at least two hydrants are required on a vessel. Recommendedfire fighting practice includes the use of a lead hose and a backup hose.A vessel of not more than 65 feet in length carrying more than 49 passengerswould be required to have a power driven fire pump that delivers 50 psiin sufficient volume to provide an effective stream of water from a firehose attached to the highest hydrant. The current requirement for sucha vessel is only for an effective stream from a hose at the highest hydrant.This proposal gives an owner a specific requirement which can be used toproperly design the fire main system. A pressure of 50 psi should be sufficientto provide an adequate stream of water for fire fighting on most vesselsof not more than 65 feet in length. Under the proposed rules, the power driven fire pump must be capable ofboth remote and local operation. Remote operation is necessary to ensurea fire pump can be started quickly in event of a fire. Presently, on mostvessels, a person must go into the unmanned engineroom, locate the pump,make sure necessary piping is properly arranged, and then start the pump.This wastes valuable time, possibly allowing a fire to enlarge. Also, withlimited crew and no assurance that the required deckhands have any trainingin engineering practices, requiring the capability of remote operationof the fire pump is the best way to ensure that fire fighting water willbe readily available and that the crew will be able to perform other firefighting tasks. Proposed andSection; 181.320 requires all fire hose nozzles to be combinationtype nozzles capable of supplying a solid stream and a spray pattern. Combinationnozzles are not presently required but are being proposed to provide bothstraight streams and fog streams necessary to fight fires of differenttypes. All other inspected vessels are presently required to have combinationnozzles. The proposed rules require that all nozzles on vessels of morethan 65 feet in length be Coast Guard approved; smaller vessels would notbe required to have approved nozzles. The only nozzles approved by theCoast Guard, under 46 CFR Subchapter Q, are combination nozzles. <T3>Subpart D_Fixed Fire Extinguishing and Detecting Systems. </T3>ProposedandSection; 181.400 specifies the required fire protection, detecting, andextinguishing equipment for certain spaces on small passenger vessels dependingon the use of the space, the number of passengers carried, and the natureof service. The proposed rules contain an important increase in the firefighting capability of small passenger vessels. Existing andSection; 181.20-1requires the installation of a fixed carbon dioxide fire extinguishingsystem in: Machinery and fuel tank spaces of all vessels using gasolineor other fuel having a flash point of 110 anddegrees;F or lower, paint andoil rooms and similar hazardous spaces, and inaccessible cargo spaces usedfor combustible cargo. In addition to retaining the requirements of existingandSection; 181.20-1, proposed andSection; 181.400(a) requires a fixed gasextinguishing system in all machinery spaces containing main propulsionmachinery, internal combustion engines of over 50 hp, or oil fired boilers.Prior to proposing the requirements for fixed gas fire extinguishing systems,all reported machinery space fires on small passenger vessels during theperiod 1981-1986 were evaluated. During that period there were fifty machineryspace fires reported to the Coast Guard, which represents 57 percent ofthe reported fires. The number of actual fires may be higher since allfires are not required to be reported. Of the 50 reported fires, 5 resultedin the total loss of the vessel. In 21 of the fires, a fixed gas fire extinguishingsystem probably would have resulted in a significant reduction in damageto the vessel by preventing the spread of the fire once it was discovered.The remaining fires were either quickly extinguished with portable fireextinguishers or went out on their own. As a result of the M/V PILGRIM BELLE casualty in 1985, the NTSB recommendedthat a fixed gas fire extinguishing system be required in the machineryspace of all small passenger vessels with overnight accommodations formore than 50 passengers. Coast Guard investigators have also recommendedfixed gas fire extinguishing systems in the machinery space of small passengervessels following fires in those spaces on three other vessels. Under existing andSection;andSection; 175.05-1(b) and 175.05-15, the OCMI andCommandant may require certain vessels to be equipped with fixed gas fireextinguishing systems and detecting systems in accordance with SubchapterH when the size of the vessel, nature of voyages, and/or the hazards involvedare incompatible with the existing requirements. NVIC 11-83 notes thata vessel with overnight accommodations for more than 50 passengers shouldnormally be required to comply with the fixed gas fire extinguishing systemand detecting system requirements of Subchapter H. Halon systems are notaddressed in current regulations; the present policy guidance regardingthese systems is contained in NVIC 6-72, Change 1, Guide to Fire FightingEquipment Aboard Merchant Vessels. In developing the proposed requirements for fixed gas fire extinguishingsystems, the following requirements and recommendations for other vesselswere considered: 46 CFR Subchapter H (Passenger Vessels), 1974 Safety ofLife at Sea Convention, NVIC 5-86 (``Voluntary Standards for U.S. UninspectedCommercial Fishing Vessels''), NVIC 6-72 (``Guide to Fire Fighting EquipmentAboard Merchant Vessels''), National Fire Protection Association Standard101 (``Life Safety Code''), and Canadian regulations for small passengervessels. Proposed andSection; 181.400(b) discusses alternatives and exceptions tothe requirement for a fixed gas fire extinguishing system that complieswith proposed andSection; 181.410. Proposed andSection; 181.410 contains thedesign, installation, and testing requirements for custom engineered systems.Proposed andSection; 181.410(b)(2) would permit the use of pre-engineeredHalon systems, which were originally developed for recreational vessels,in a normally unoccupied space if the volume of the space is not more than1200 cubic feet. The largest size, pre-engineered system presently approvedis only capable of protecting a space of not more than 1200 cubic feet.The terms ``custom engineered'' and ``pre-engineered'' are derived fromindustry standards and are defined in proposed andSection; 175.400.Proposed andSection; 181.400(b)(3) allows a B-II portable fire extinguisherto substitute for a required fixed system for paint lockers and spacescontaining flammable liquid stores with a volume of not more than 200 cubicfeet. Proposed andSection; 181.400 also requires fire detecting systems to provideearly detection of fires, allowing time for evacuation and effective firefighting. A fire detecting system would be required in:1. A normally unoccupied machinery space containing propulsion machinery,an internal combustion engine of over 50 hp, gasoline powered machinery,or an oil fired boiler, if the machinery space is not fitted with an automaticallyactuated fixed gas fire extinguishing system capable of automatic dischargeupon heat detection; 2. Each accommodation space and service space on a vessel carrying morethan 150 passengers; 3. Each accommodation space and service space on a vessel with overnightaccommodations for more than 49 passengers and/or carrying more than 400passengers; and 4. An enclosed vehicle space. The proposal requires modular independent smoke detecting units, whichcomply with UL Standard 217 for recreational vehicles, for berthing spaceson vessels with overnight accommodations for not more than 49 passengers.Finally, on vessels with overnight accommodations for more than 49 passengersor carrying more than 400 passengers, the proposal requires independentheat detectors for the activation of fixed fire extinguishing systems overall grills, broilers, and deep fat fryers.Proposed andSection; 181.400(j) requires that all vessels using gasoline,or any fuel with a flash point of 110anddegrees; F or lower, be equippedwith a flammable vapor detection system complying with Underwriters Laboratoriesstandards. These detectors are necessary to detect volatile vapors whichmay result in explosion and fire. Three of the four persons injured inreported fuel related fires and explosions on small passenger vessels duringthe period 1981-1986 were on gasoline powered vessels. One of the injuriesoccurred due to the explosion and fire on the M/V QUINSIPPI at Zuning,IL in 1982. The QUINSIPPI had actually been equipped with a vapor detector;however, after the detector alarm sounded several times the master assumedthe detector was defective and turned it off when he could not detect anygasoline leak or buildup. Properly used flammable vapor detectors may haveprevented all three of the casualties and saved more than $50,000 in damages.The estimated cost of a vapor detection system for the average gasolinepowered vessel is $200. <T3>Subpart E_Portable Fire Extinguishers.</T3> Proposed andSection; 181.500(a)allows the selection of Halon portable fire extinguishers which are notaddressed in existing Subchapter T. It also requires that the number ofportable extinguishers for accommodation spaces be based on the area ofthe space, as is the requirement of Subchapter H for large passengers vessels.<T3>Subpart F_Additional Equipment.</T3> Proposed andSection; 181.610 requiresall vessels to have three buckets capable of being used for fire fightinginstead of the portable hand fire pump required by existing andSection; 181.10-5.Numerous Coast Guard field units have reported that the portable hand pumpsare unsatisfactory for fire fighting. Presently, a portable hand bilgepump may also serve as a fire pump, but the combination pump many ownersuse to serve as both a bilge and a fire pump is unsatisfactory for firefighting. Buckets are considered to be more beneficial than portable handfire pumps because they can actually provide a greater water volume, areless expensive, and are maintenance free. <ITAG tagnum="81">Part 182_Machinery Installations </ITAG><T3>General.</T3> The basic format and contents of proposed Part 182 isunchanged from the existing regulations except: (1) Requirements for gasoline and diesel machinery installations, not includingventilation requirements, are combined to eliminate redundancy; and (2) The materials tables for independent gasoline and diesel fuel tanksin the existing regulations are combined with limitations on use includedin footnotes. <T3>Subpart B_Propulsion Machinery.</T3> Proposed andSection; 182.200 requiresthat all engines be provided with at least two means for stopping the enginesunder any operating conditions. Diesel and gas turbine engines rated at300 horsepower or more would also be required to have an emergency overspeedshut down device. This proposal reflects the requirements of paragraph9.2.3 of the IMO ``Code of Safety for Dynamically Supported Craft'' (IMOCode). However, as incorporated here, its application is not limited todynamically supported craft as it is a safety feature beneficial to allengine installations regardless of vessel type. The economic impact ofthis requirement is expected to be insignificant as a majority of enginesare currently equipped with adequate shutdowns. Most classification societyrules also require an emergency overspeed shutdown device on large engineson classed vessels. Although few small passenger vessels are classed, classificationsociety rules provide acceptable guidance for machinery installations onsmall passenger vessels. <T3>Subpart C_Auxiliary Machinery.</T3> Proposed andSection; 182.320 incorporatescurrent policy and applicable regulations in Subchapter F on hot waterheaters and pressure vessels which are presently applied to small passengervessels. This proposal allows the installation of moderately sized, electrichot water heaters which meet Underwriters Laboratories Inc. standards.This proposal imposes no additional costs on small passenger vessel owners.<T3>Subpart D_Specific Machinery Requirements.</T3> Proposed andSection;182.410(b) regulates the design, construction, and materials used for machinerycontaining high energy rotating parts. This provision was incorporatedfrom paragraph 9.1.3 of the IMO ``Code of Safety for Dynamically SupportedCraft.'' As incorporated here, these requirements are not limited to DSC,but apply to all engine installations, regardless of vessel type. Proposed andSection; 182.420 revises the requirements on air cooled engineinstallations. Existing Part 182 limits air cooled engine installationsto gasoline auxiliary engines on open deck and diesel auxiliary and propulsionengines above and below deck. However, current policy, expressed in VolumeII of the Marine Safety Manual, paragraph 10 A.2.j, permits air cooledauxiliary and propulsion gasoline engines that meet ABYC Project P-10.This policy applies to all vessels although Project P-10 was intended onlyfor small craft. Therefore, proposed andSection; 182.420 would allow an aircooled, gasoline auxiliary engine to be located on a weather deck of anyvessel, but only in an enclosed or partially enclosed space on a vesselof not more than 65 feet in length carrying not more than 12 passengers,and only if the engine installation complies with ABYC Project P-10. Anair cooled, gasoline propulsion engine, regardless of its location, wouldonly be allowed on a vessel of not more than 65 feet in length carryingnot more than 12 passengers, and only if the engine installation complieswith ABYC Project P-10. Proposed andSection; 182.422 incorporates current regulations in SubchapterF and existing policy for keel cooler and grid cooler installations. Theexisting regulations do not address such installations. Proposed andSection; 182.425 differentiates between requirements pertainingto wet and dry exhaust systems. Due to their higher operating temperature,dry exhaust systems must meet standards more stringent than standards forwet exhaust systems. Existing regulations do not differentiate betweenwet and dry exhaust systems. As a result, certain standards, which shouldonly apply to dry exhaust systems, are unnecessarily applied to all exhaustinstallations. Such standards include stringent bulkhead penetration andother insulation requirements. These requirements would be revised to applyonly to dry exhaust systems. Nonmetallic flexible hose is permitted byexisting Part 182 in both wet and dry exhaust systems. The revision proposespermitting nonmetallic exhaust hose only for wet exhaust systems, consistentwith current policy and ABYC Project P-1. Materials listed in ABYC ProjectP-1 would be accepted. These revisions to the engine exhaust cooling requirementsare expected to provide a cost savings of $200 for a vessel equipped witha water cooled exhaust system. Proposed andSection; 182.440(a)(1) and Table 182.440(a)(1) allow aluminumalloys 5052 and 5083 of ASTM B209 to be accepted as materials for independentfuel tanks. The existing tables on independent tank materials, Tables 182.15-25(a)(1)and 182.20-25(a)(1), only specifically allow the use of aluminum alloy5086. The proposal is consistent with current policy although the alloysare not listed in the existing tank material tables. The maximum capacityof an independent tank built with the tabulated thicknesses in proposedTable 182.440(a)(1) is 400 gallons. Above 400 gallons, tanks must be designedwith a factor of safety of four on the ultimate strength of the materialused, with a design head of not less than 4 feet of liquid above the topof the tank. This is consistent with current policy and the requirementsfor independent tanks constructed under Part 58 of Subchapter F, and recognizesthat large tanks must be individually designed to ensure adequate strength.Proposed andSection; 182.440(a)(7) allows independent fuel tanks with horizontaldimensions exceeding 30 inches to be installed either without any baffles,or with baffles which are more than 30 inches apart, if design calculationsshow that baffles located at intervals of not more than 30 inches are notnecessary. The existing regulations require that an independent fuel tankhave baffles at intervals of not more than 30 inches if the tank exceeds30 inches in any horizontal dimension. An estimated cost savings of $100is expected for each vessel having tanks which would not be required tohave baffles under this proposed regulation. Proposed andSection; 182.455 accepts U.S.C.G Types Al, A2, Bl, and B2 flexiblehoses for fuel line applications subject to operating pressures of lessthan 5 psi. The final rule on fuel system standards for recreational boats,published May 27, 1987 (52 FR 19726), discusses the four fuel hose types.Although the recently published requirements do not limit the use of TypesAl, A2, Bl, and B2 flexible hoses to 5 psi for recreational boats, theproposed 5 psi limitation for these hoses on small passenger vessels isconsistent with current policy. This will allow owners and managing operatorsto more easily procure off-the-shelf flexible hoses and will provide anapproximate $30 savings over a wire-reinforced, flexible hose which wouldotherwise be required by proposed andSection; 182.455(a)(2)(ii) and is nowrequired by andSection;andSection; 182.15-40(a)(3) and 182.20-40(a)(2)(ii).Proposed andSection; 182.455(a)(2)(v) requires that a flexible hose assemblyin a fuel line, which includes the hose, cover, and fittings, meet theSociety of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standard, SAE J1942_``Hose and HoseAssemblies for Marine Applications,'' or be specifically approved by theCommandant. Standard SAE J1942 is presently in a draft form and is expectedto be published as an accepted standard by the Society of Automotive Engineersprior to promulgation of the final rule under this docket. Existing andSection;andSection;182.15-40(a)(3) and 182.20-40(a)(2) require that a flexible hose coverbe determined to be self-extinguishing in accordance with ASTM SpecificationD1692, which is no longer valid, and that the hose assembly withstand afree burning gasoline test. Proposed SAE J1942 includes a fire test requirementas well as many of the other requirements for flexible hoses in proposedandSection; 182.455(a)(2). Flexible hoses which would meet SAE J1942 areexpected to be widely available. If proposed SAE J1942 is not adopted priorto issuance of the final rule under this docket, the Coast Guard intendsto require nonmetallic flexible hose assemblies to meet the requirementsof 46 CFR 56.60-25(c) of this chapter.<T3>Subpart E_Bilge andamp; Ballast Systems.</T3> Proposed andSection; 182.500requires that vessels of more than 65 feet in length with overnight accommodationsfor more than 49 overnight passengers, and vessels of more than 65 feetin length carrying more than 150 passengers, comply with the bilge systemrequirements of 46 CFR Subchapter F (andSection;andSection; 56.50-50 and 56.50-55),with the exception of emergency bilge pump requirements. This proposalincorporates provisions of NVIC 11-83. The application of Subchapter Fregulations to vessels carrying more than 150 passengers is based on currentandSection; 175.05-1(b) which allows the OCMI to apply Subchapter F to vesselscarrying more than 150 passengers. This revision will ensure consistenttreatment among OCMI zones and provides a more adequate level of safetyfor ``very large'' small passenger vessels with overnight accommodationsfor more than 49 passengers and large daytime excursion vessels than dothe specific bilge requirements proposed in Subchapter T. Compliance withthe Subchapter F regulations would cost approximately $400 more per vesselthan compliance with the specific Subchapter T bilge requirements. Proposed andSection; 182.520 would revise existing andSection; 182.25-10. Theexisting regulations require that vessels of not more than 65 feet in lengthbe equipped with a portable hand bilge pump. The Coast Guard has receivedseveral comments on the inadequacy of portable hand pumps. Under the proposedregulation, power pumps would be allowed as an alternative when portableand fixed hand pumps are required. Where a power pump used as an alternativeto a hand pump serves as the second required pump on a vessel, it mustbe supplied by a source of power independent of the other power bilge pump.Vessels of not more than 65 feet in length and carrying not more than 49passengers, other than ferry vessels, would be allowed to use fixed electric,submersible pumps to serve as the power bilge pump required by proposedTable 182.520(a). Submerged electric bilge pumps are not specifically authorizedby the existing regulations. These pumps are often the preferred optionof builders and have proven successful in certain applications. The acceptanceof electric submersible bilge pumps reflects current policy of many OCMIsand satisfactory experience with such pumps. The use of such pumps mayresult in a cost savings of $150 per vessel. The proposed rules address catamaran type hulls by incorporating currentpolicy. Provided the bilge pumps are of suitable capacity and are locatedseparately in each hull, only two bilge pumps will be required where thefire pump is cross connected with the bilge system and each bilge pumpis capable of dewatering the opposite hull through permanent piping. Proposed andSection; 182.530 requires that bilge level alarms be installedin all unattended machinery spaces located below the deepest load waterlineon vessels of at least 26 feet in length. Review of casualties indicatethat a contributing cause of many sinkings and founderings is undetectedflooding. In many cases, early detection of flooding would have saved avessel. The National Transportation Safety Board has recommended that bilgelevel alarms be required on certain small passenger vessels. The net costfor such an installation is estimated to be between $200 and $400 per vessel.<T3>Subpart F_Steering Requirements.</T3> Proposed Subpart F contains newrequirements for minimum rudder swing times, a rudder angle indicator forcertain vessels, electrical requirements, and rudder stops. Existing steeringregulations in Part 182 do not adequately address the variety of steeringarrangements found on small passenger vessels. Existing regulations furtherfail to give sufficient guidance as to what constitutes a ``suitable steeringapparatus.'' The expanded steering requirements in the proposed rules givespecific guidance for safe design and installation of steering systems.These revisions reflect current safety standards for steering systems andare, for the most part, consistent with steering systems presently beingdesigned for small passenger vessels. Most existing vessels already meetthe proposed requirements. However, proposed andSection; 182.610 includesa new requirement for a rudder angle indicator on vessels of more than65 feet in length with power-driven steering gear. Small passenger vesselsare presently not required to have rudder angle indicators. A review ofsteering casualties on all vessels with power actuated steering shows thata rudder angle indicator provides the initial indication of a casualty.The proposed requirement is consistent with regulations presently requiringrudder angle indicators on vessels comparable in size to small passengervessels of more than 65 feet in length, including offshore supply vesselsand sailing school vessels. The proposed steering system requirements areexpected to result in only minor cost increases for most vessels. A vesselof more than 65 feet in length is expected to have an estimated cost increaseof $150 primarily due to the rudder angle indicator requirements. <T3>Subpart G_Piping Systems.</T3> Proposed Subpart G addresses the materialsused in and the installation of piping systems. The proposal contains atiered set of requirements that range from materials being acceptable tothe OCMI for non-vital systems under 150 psi to invoking Subchapter F,Subpart 56.60, for vital systems on vessels of more than 65 feet in lengthwith overnight accommodations for more than 49 passengers and on all vesselscarrying more than 150 passengers. Several OCMIs currently impose similarstandards and the economic impact of the proposal should be negligible.Existing Subpart 182.40 addresses nonmetallic piping materials. In theproposed rules, the requirements on nonmetallic piping materials sectionhave been retained in andSection; 182.720, and a new section, andSection; 182.730,on nonferrous metallic piping materials has been developed from existingregulations in Subchapter F, with modifications to reflect current policyon the use of aluminum piping. Proposed andSection; 182.730 is not expectedto create a significant economic burden as the majority of the requirementsreflect existing Coast Guard policy and small passenger vessel industrypractices on the use of nonferrous metallic piping. <ITAG tagnum="81">Part 183_Electrical Installations </ITAG><T3>General.</T3> Proposed Part 183 updates the existing electrical regulationsby providing requirements more appropriate for the sophisticated electricalsystems found on small passenger vessels today and incorporates currentpolicies and practices which have been accepted by the Coast Guard. Toeliminate some redundancy, similar regulations in the existing Subpart183.05, ``Electrical Installations Operating at Potentials of Less Than50 Volts,'' and existing Subpart 183.10, ``Electrical Installations Operatingat Potentials of 50 Volts or More,'' have been consolidated. <T3>Section 183.310 Power Sources.</T3> Proposed andSection; 183.310 requiresthat each vessel which relies on electricity to power its ship's serviceloads, have two sources of electrical power capable of providing powerto certain essential loads. The combination of a generator or alternatordriven by the main engine, and a battery, would meet this requirement.This proposed requirement is intended to prevent the failure of one powersource from disabling a vessel. The cost to comply with this proposed requirementvaries for each vessel. Most small passenger vessels of not more than 65feet in length presently comply with the proposed requirement. For instance,a vessel with battery started propulsion machinery with an alternator tocharge the battery would comply. A small passenger vessel with a largegenerator for ship's service loads may have to have a second generatorat a cost of more than $1,000. However, since most larger small passengervessels being built today are being equipped with two generators, the actualcost to the small passenger vessel industry of this requirement is consideredminimal.<T3>Sections 183.322 and 183.324 Multiple generators and dual-voltage generators.</T3>Proposed andSection;andSection; 183.322 and 183.324 address the installationof multiple generators and dual voltage generators. The requirements arewritten to ensure that the operation of multiple generators does not jeopardizea vessel or persons onboard. A dual-voltage generator is required to haveits neutral grounded at the switchboard to ensure that the ground voltagecan be properly monitored. Since most small passenger vessels already complywith the proposed requirements, the actual cost to the small passengerindustry of these requirements is considered minimal. <T3>Section 183.340 Cable and Wiring Requirements. </T3>Proposed andSection;183.340 would replace existing andSection;andSection; 183.05-40, 183.05-45,183.05-50, and 183.10-20. This new section incorporates present practicesand Coast Guard policy on the installation and use of cable and wire. TheCoast Guard has received numerous comments recommending that the existingregulations be revised to reflect such policies and practices. The proposedregulation allows use of cable constructed to National Electrical Codestandards, Underwriters Laboratories listed marine cable, or any cableconstructed in accordance with andSection; 111.60 of 46 CFR Subchapter J(Electrical). This proposal eliminates the outdated tables in existingSubchapter T on maximum current carrying capacities for cable and incorporatesby reference electrical industry standards. The proposed section is expectedto impose no additional cost on the small passenger vessel industry. <T3>Section 183.354 Battery installation. </T3>Proposed andSection; 183.354contains requirements for three, different size battery categories. Thisnew section is necessary because battery systems of the size not adequatelyregulated by the existing Subchapter T are being installed on the largersmall passenger vessels being built today. Compliance with the proposedregulations, primarily adopted from 46 CFR Subchapter J (Electrical), willdecrease the hazards associated with larger battery systems. This regulationis only expected to increase costs on new small passenger vessels whichhave large battery installations. Most vessels built with small or moderateinstallations already comply with the proposed regulations for these batteryinstallations. <T3>Section 183.360 Semiconductor rectifier systems. </T3>Proposed andSection;183.360 contains new requirements for semiconductor rectifier systems (SCR).The use of SCRs in the marine environment is becoming common practice.The proposed requirements ensure that the installation of these systemsin vital circuits does not jeopardize a system's integrity or the safetyof persons. <T3>Section 183.380 Overcurrent Protection. </T3>Proposed andSection; 183.380changes the requirements for lighting branch circuit protection. The presentrequirements limit lighting branch circuit breakers to 15 amperes. Theproposed regulations allow for lighting branch circuits to utilize 30 amperecircuit breaker protection. This reflects present electrical industry standardsand the National Electrical Code.<T3>Section 183.410 Lighting fixtures. </T3>Proposed andSection; 183.410contains more specific requirements for lighting fixtures than the existingregulations. Existing andSection; 183.05-35 only states that lights on vesselswith electrical installations operating at potentials of less than 50 voltsmust be of types listed by, or types equal to those listed by, UnderwritersLaboratories or other recognized testing laboratories. The proposed regulationslist specific requirements that a lighting fixture on a small passengervessel, regardless of the electrical system, must meet. General safetyinstallation requirements, such as securing of fixtures and protectionof exposed globes and lenses, which lighting fixtures on small passengervessels should and do normally meet, are adopted in this proposal fromandSection; 111.75-20 of Subchapter J. The proposal does retain the currentrequirement, contained in existing andSection; 183.10-20(1), that lightingfixtures on a vessel with electrical installations operating at potentialsof 50 volts or more meet UL Standard 595, ``Standard for Marine Type ElectricalLighting Fixtures,'' or be constructed in accordance with the requirementsof other recognized testing laboratories. A lighting fixture in an electrical system of more than 50 volts need notbe listed by Underwriters Laboratories, but an owner must show the fixturecomplies with UL 595. UL 595 contains separate requirements for both interiorand exterior lighting on a vessel. The Coast Guard has received commentsthat interior lighting should be allowed to meet UL Standard 57, ``ElectricLighting Fixtures.'' UL 57 does not provide for the vibration and movementthat fixtures are subject to on vessels. However, lighting fixtures listedunder UL 57 may be used in interior spaces on a vessel if an owner canshow that the fixture also complies with the requirements of UL 595. <T3>Section 183.430 Portable lights. </T3>Proposed andSection; 183.430 requiresthat each vessel be equipped with at least two portable battery lights.Existing andSection; 184.30-1 only requires that each vessel have a suitablenumber of lights. Requiring a specific, minimum number of lights will helpeliminate inconsistencies and ensure that vessels are adequately equipped.On most vessels, at least two portable lights would be necessary upon failureof primary lighting. <T3>Section 183.432 Emergency lighting. </T3>Proposed andSection; 183.432requires, on a vessel of more than 65 feet in length, emergency lightingcapable of providing sufficient lighting to allow persons to get to opendecks from all accommodation spaces, machinery spaces, and workspaces onthe vessel. Existing andSection; 180.30-5 only requires that emergency lightingbe fitted along the line of escape on a vessel having lounge areas belowthe main deck. However, emergency lighting is especially necessary on largervessels where flashlights would provide insufficient lighting because ofvessel size or the number of passengers carried. This proposal thereforerequires that vessels of more than 65 feet in length have emergency lightingfor escape from all spaces. Vessels of not more than 65 feet in lengthwould only be required to have the emergency lighting presently required.This proposal is not expected to have a significant cost impact on theindustry since most vessels are presently equipped with satisfactory emergencylighting. <T3>Section 183.510 Propulsion engine control systems. </T3>Proposed andSection;183.510 contains new requirements for controlling propulsion engines. Itrequires that a vessel have a means for shutting down a propulsion engineat each location where a propulsion engine can be started or its speedcontrolled. The means to shut down must be independent of the speed control.Pilothouse control units normally comply with this requirement. Proposed andSection; 183.510 also requires that a vessel with only one propulsionengine have a backup means of controlling the propulsion engine in additionto pilothouse control. A mechanical linkage propulsion control system thathas a disconnect device fitted at the engine to disconnect the remote control,with an efficient means to operate the engine locally, would meet thisrequirement. A twin engine vessel with independent remote propulsion controlswould not need backup means of controlling the engines. The proposed requirementshelp ensure that a vessel will not be disabled due to a single fault ofa propulsion engine control system.<ITAG tagnum="81">Part 184_Vessel Control and Miscellaneous Systems and Equipment </ITAG><T3>Section 184.115 Applicability to existing vessels. </T3>The regulationsproposed in this part would apply to existing vessels except as noted inandSection; 184.115. Most of the requirements in proposed Part 184 are containedin the existing regulations. New requirements being proposed for inclusionin Part 184 were evaluated for need and cost to determine whether theyshould be applicable to existing vessels. An existing vessel would nothave to comply with andSection;andSection; 184.402(d), 184.404, 184.406, 184.408,184.410, and 184.602 of this part unless the OCMI specifically requirescompliance. This provision is included because some OCMIs presently requirethe installation of electronic navigational equipment on certain vesselsdue to the route and service of those vessels, and the weather and vesseltraffic conditions within a particular marine inspection zone. Due to the need to ensure that all passengers can be properly advised inemergency situations, the new requirement for a public address (PA) system,in proposed andSection; 184.610, would be applicable to existing vessels.However, so that an owner has sufficient time to plan for the installationand cost of a PA system, a phase in period for PA systems on existing vesselsis proposed. An existing vessel would also have to comply with the new requirement fora first aid kit in proposed andSection; 184.710. <T3>Sections 184.210 and 184.220 Heating and cooking equipment. </T3>ProposedandSection;andSection; 184.210 and 184.220 were primarily developed from existingandSection; 183.10-45 (Electric heating and cooking equipment (50 volts ormore)). The requirements in existing andSection; 183.10-45 are safety provisionsthat generally should be applicable to all heating and cooking equipment,not just electrical heating and cooking equipment. American Boat and YachtCouncil (ABYC), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and UnderwritersLaboratories (UL) standards were considered in developing the proposedregulations. These two proposed sections are expected to have negligiblecost impact since most vessels already comply with these standards. <T3>Section 184.240 Gas cooking systems. </T3>No regulations are includedin proposed andSection; 184.240 in this notice. The Coast Guard intends toplace final rules developed under Coast Guard docket 83-013, ``Carriageand Use of Liquefied and Non-liquefied Gas as Cooking Fuels on VesselsCarrying Passengers,'' in this section. Final rules under CGD 83-013 areexpected to be published by January 1989. <T3>Section 184.300 Ground tackle and mooring lines. </T3>The requirementsin proposed andSection; 184.300 are basically the same as in existing andSection;184.10-1. The Coast Guard has received several comments recommending thatspecific guidance be provided in the regulations on anchoring equipment.However, the size and type of anchors, cables, and hawsers necessary tosafely anchor or moor a vessel vary significantly and are dependent onmany factors. No single table or guide could fairly cover each possiblesituation. Therefore, the Coast Guard is proposing that the owner be responsiblefor determining how best to outfit a vessel with ground tackle and mooringlines, subject to the approval of the OCMI. Numerous industry standardsand classification society rules are available as guidelines. <T3>Subpart D_Navigation Equipment. </T3>Proposed Subpart D contains newrequirements for certain navigational equipment including a lighted compass,radar, fathometer, and an electronic position fixing device. This equipmentis designed to improve the safety of navigation and reduce the risks ofcollisions, groundings, and other navigational casualties. Much of the navigation equipment being proposed is presently required tobe installed only on inspected vessels of at least 1600 gross tons. Thenavigational equipment is required on vessels of at least 1600 gross tonsdue to the inherent risks of operating such large vessels. There are alsomany inherent risks in operating small passenger vessels due to the numberof passengers carried, operating areas, and the increased size of the vessels.As with vessels of at least 1600 gross tons, the inherent risk of operatingmany small passenger vessels can be reduced by the installation and useof electronic navigational equipment. A review of small passenger vessel casualties for the period 1981-1986showed several casualties in which equipment that the Coast Guard is proposingto require was installed aboard the involved vessels at the time of thecasualties. The installed equipment would have aided the masters of thesevessels in avoiding the casualties if the equipment had been properly used.When Subchapter T regulations were initially promulgated, electronic equipmentsuch as radar, LORAN, and fathometers, was unavailable or prohibitivelyexpensive. However, with improved technology and mass production, costshave decreased and availability has increased, making it practical formany owners to voluntarily outfit their vessels with state of the art equipment.<T3>1. Section 184.402 Compasses. </T3>Proposed andSection; 184.402, whichreplaces existing andSection; 184.20-1, contains new requirements that, whencompasses are required, they be mounted at the operating station when avessel is underway and that they be illuminated when the vessel is authorizedto operate at night. These requirements would incorporate standard, safemarine practices to ensure that all small passenger vessels follow suchpractices. Because most vessels already have a lighted and mounted compass,the cost of these proposed regulations is negligible. <T3>2. Section 184.404 Radar. </T3>Proposed andSection; 184.404 requiresmarine radar systems on certain vessels. Existing Subchapter T does notrequire radar for any vessel. The Coast Guard determined that four classesof vessels would most benefit from a radar system, when the cost of sucha system is considered, due to their route, nighttime operations, and sizeor number of passengers. The four classes include ``very large'' smallpassenger vessels with overnight accommodations for more than 49 passengers;vessels operating on oceans, coastwise, and Great Lakes routes carryingmore than 49 passengers; vessels carrying more than 150 passengers; andDSC certified for nighttime or restricted visibility operations. The riskof collision or other casualty due to improper navigation would be decreasedif radar is installed and properly used on the four classes of vesselsaddressed by this proposal.As a result of the PILGRIM BELLE casualty, the National TransportationSafety Board (NTSB) recommended that ``very large'' small passenger vesselswith overnight accommodations for more than 49 passengers operating onany route other than rivers, be equipped with a gyrostabilized radar. TheCoast Guard does not believe that the benefits of a gyrostabilized radaron a small passenger vessel would outweigh the cost. However, the CoastGuard is proposing that all ``very large'' small passenger vessels withovernight accommodations for more than 49 passengers be equipped with radarwhich need not be gyrostabilized. The Coast Guard is proposing that eventhe ``very large'' small passenger vessels operating on river routes haveradars to decrease the risks involved in navigating long stretches of riversin restricted visibility. Similarly, vessels operating on oceans, coastwise, or Great Lakes routesand carrying more than 49 passengers, and all vessels carrying more than150 passengers, face increased risks as a result of their routes and size.Vessels certificated to operate on oceans, coastwise, or Great Lakes routesoften do so at night or may encounter unexpected restricted visibilityconditions or poor weather. Such vessels primarily include party fishingboats and crew boats. Vessels carrying more than 150 passengers are normallylarge vessels with less maneuverability than smaller vessels. Consequently,they would benefit from earlier warning of impending collisions as wellas improved navigational ability. A vessel operating on an oceans, coastwise,or Great Lakes route carrying more than 49 passengers, or carrying morethan 150 passengers on any route, but which does not have overnight accommodationsfor more than 49 passengers, would not be required to have radar if theOCMI determines that the operation of the vessel involves minimal navigationalrisk due to such factors as limited vessel traffic in the area or limitedrisk of sudden reduced visibility. Proposed andSection; 184.404 also requires radar on all dynamically supportedcraft certificated for nighttime or restricted visibility operations asdoes the IMO ``Code of Safety for Dynamically Supported Craft.'' Since most existing vessels affected by this proposal are already fittedwith radar at the option of the owner, proposed andSection; 184.404 is expectedto be of minimal cost to the small passenger vessel industry. An estimated82% of vessels carrying more than 49 passengers on an ocean, coastwise,or Great Lakes route are presently equipped with radar. An estimated 67%of vessels carrying more than 150 passengers regardless of route are equippedwith radar. The average cost of a marine radar system acceptable underthis proposal, including installation, which would probably be installedon a ``very large'' small passenger vessel or a small passenger vesselcarrying more than 150 passengers, is $3000. <T3>3. Section 184.408 Fathometers. </T3>Proposed andSection; 184.408 requiresa fathometer on all vessels of more than 65 feet in length and each DSC,except an air cushion vehicle. Subchapter T does not presently requirefathometers. A fathometer is a relatively inexpensive navigational devicethat can improve the safety of navigation. As a result of the PILGRIM BELLEgrounding, the NTSB recommended that all passenger vessels on routes otherthan rivers be equipped with fathometers. The Coast Guard does agree thatproperly used fathometers could prevent many groundings. This proposalis expected to have minimal economic impact since more than 50% of vesselsof more than 65 feet in length are equipped with fathometers. The averagecost of an acceptable fathometer, including installation, is $200.<T3>4. Section 184.410 Electronic position fixing devices. </T3>ProposedandSection; 184.410 requires each vessel on a oceans route to be equippedwith an electronic position fixing device capable of providing accuratefixes for the area in which the vessel operates. Electronic position fixingequipment enables a vessel to accurately locate its position in all weatherconditions. An acceptable device could include a LORAN receiver, a satellitenavigation receiver, or another device which provides accurate fixes forthe area in which the vessel operates. This proposed requirement is expectedto have a minimal cost impact on the small vessel industry since most vesselsin ocean service are presently outfitted with electronic position fixingdevices. The average cost of a LORAN unit, including installation, is $700.00.<T3>Section 184.506 Emergency broadcast placard. </T3>Proposed andSection;184.506 requires a placard to be placed next to all radiotelephones todirect a person unfamiliar with radio procedures on the use of the radioin an emergency. This requirement would apply to new and existing vessels.The requirement was proposed by the NTSB as a result of the FANTASY ISLANDERcasualty when a person unfamiliar with radio procedures had to make anemergency broadcast. The proposed contents of the placard were derivedfrom the Vessel Safety Manual published by the North Pacific Fishing VesselOwner's Association and Field Operation Bulletin No. 2 of the Federal CommunicationsCommission. The estimated cost of the proposed placard is $10.00. <T3>Section 184.602 Internal communications. </T3>Proposed andSection; 184.602(a) and (b) are new requirements for a permanently installed, fixed meansof communications between the operating station and the location wherea backup means of controlling the propulsion machinery is accomplishedor where auxiliary steering means are located. This would ensure that theperson in charge of navigating the vessel is able to communicate with theperson manning a backup control station required by proposed andSection;183.510 or the auxiliary steering stations required by proposed andSection;182.600(c). Satisfactory voice communication would be acceptable insteadof a fixed system on many vessels. Additionally, the proposed requirementswould not be applicable to twin screwed vessels with pilothouse controlfor both engines. Since most small passenger vessels are twin screwed,these proposals for internal communication would only apply to a smallnumber of small passenger vessels. Means of communication which would satisfythe proposed requirements range from a simple sound tube to a three way,talk-back speaker system which would cost approximately $1500.00 on thesize vessel which would have to comply. Proposed andSection; 182.600(c) would replace existing andSection; 184.35-1without any substantive changes being made.<T3>Section 184.610 Public address (PA) systems. </T3>Proposed Section184.610 requires a PA System on certain vessels. This proposed requirementwould be applicable to existing vessels. This requirement is based on NTSBand Coast Guard recommendations as a result of the casualties involvingthe PILGRIM BELLE, YANKEE, MISSISSIPPI QUEEN, and other vessels. On vesselswith more than one deck, it is often very difficult for the master to quicklyand adequately notify all passengers of an emergency situation withouta PA system. For the same reason, a PA system will be required on vesselswhich have only one passenger deck but on which passengers may be sleepingin separate compartments. A PA system, which may be used to sound the generalalarm required by proposed andSection; 183.550, is necessary to quickly arouseand advise such passengers. A PA system would also help ensure all passengershear the passenger safety orientation required by proposed andSection; 185.506.Under the proposal, small passenger vessels of not more than 65 feet carryingnot more than 49 passengers would not be required to have a PA system,even if the vessel is otherwise required to have one, if the OCMI determinesthat all passengers can satisfactorily hear public announcements made fromthe operating station. A bullhorn may also be acceptable as the PA systemon a vessel of not more than 65 feet in length. The estimated average cost of a PA system on a vessel of not more than65 feet is $100.00; on a vessel of more than 65 feet it is $500.00. Manysmall passenger vessels are already equipped with PA systems hence thetotal cost of this proposed requirement on the small passenger vessel industryis reduced. <T3>Section 184.710 First aid kit. </T3>Proposed andSection; 184.710 requiresa first aid kit on all new and existing small passenger vessels. This requirementis based on recommendations from Coast Guard personnel and the public,as well as from a casualty investigation. A first aid kit is necessaryon small passenger vessels for use in treating minor injuries, especiallythose which occur while a vessel is underway and other first aid assistanceis not readily available. The Coast Guard previously considered a separate rulemaking requiring firstaid kits but decided not to propose a change unless crew members were requiredto be trained in first aid. On October 16, 1987, the Coast Guard publishedan Interim Final Rule under CGD 81-059 (52 FR 38623) requiring applicantsfor issuance of original licenses to complete first aid and CPR courses.The Coast Guard approved first aid kit, which may be used to comply withthis proposal, is well equipped for most first aid needs and is specificallydesigned for the marine environment. An owner may make a first aid kitor choose any of a number of kits available on the market that containequipment equivalent to or in excess of the Coast Guard kit equipment.The approximate cost of a Coast Guard approved first aid kit is $65.00.<ITAG tagnum="81">Part 185_Operations </ITAG><T3>Section 185.115 Applicability to existing vessels. </T3>The regulationsin this part would apply to existing vessels except as noted in andSection;185.115. Most of the requirements in proposed Part 185 are contained inexisting regulations. Other proposed requirements are mandated by presentlaw and are applicable to existing vessels, but have not previously beenincorporated in regulations. Other proposed regulations are based on recommendationsfollowing casualty investigations and involve operational requirementsfor which compliance would result in the same costs for new or existingvessels. Proposed andSection; 185.115(b) allows the use of certain existing markingson equipment until such markings are no longer legible so that significantcost would not be incurred just to comply with minor changes in the contentsor size of such markings. Proposed andSection; 185.115 (a) and (c) allow phase-in periods for existingvessels permitting sufficient time to comply with certain requirementsincluding: (1) Radar observers and operating manuals for dynamically supported craft;(2) Station bills and passenger safety bills; (3) Lifejacket placards; and (4) Retroreflective tape on ring buoys and rescue boats. <T3>Sections 185.280 and 185.282 Logbooks. </T3>Proposed andSection; 185.280incorporates the requirements of 46 U.S.C. 11301 that every vessel on aforeign voyage, except on voyages to Canada, maintain an official logbook.The requirements of the law are repeated in the proposed regulation forthe convenience of the master. Proposed andSection; 185.282 requires that a vessel of more than 65 feetin length with overnight accommodations for more than 49 passengers, whichis not on a foreign voyage, maintain a log or record, which need not bean official logbook, to make entries of tests and inspections requiredby law or regulation. This proposed regulation incorporates relevant provisionsof NVIC 11-83 and 46 CFR 78.37-3(c). Since most large overnight passengervessels already maintain such records for their own purposes, this regulationis expected to have little economic impact. <T3>Section 185.304 Navigation underway. </T3>Proposed andSection; 185.304contains new requirements designed to ensure the safe navigation of a vessel.As a result of the PILGRIM BELLE casualty, the NTSB recommended that theCoast Guard require that masters and officers on vessels which have overnightaccommodations for more than 49 passengers and operate on other than riverroutes to comply with navigation procedures similar to those found at 33CFR 164.11. 33 CFR 164.11 contains navigational procedures applicable tovessels of 1600 or more gross tons operating on U.S. navigable waters.The existing regulations in 33 CFR 164.11 simply mandate procedures whichmost masters routinely perform and which are considered to be prudent seamanship.Because of the risks associated with carrying passengers, the Coast Guardis proposing that requirements in 33 CFR 164.11 applicable to small passengervessels be incorporated into Subchapter T to ensure masters and watchstandingofficers on small passenger vessels are aware of their responsibilities.Since the proposed requirements actually incorporate procedures that shouldpresently be practiced by all masters and deck officers, no economic impactis expected. <T3>Section 185.410 Watchmen. </T3>Proposed andSection; 185.410 modifiesthe existing requirements for patrolmen to better correspond with the statutoryrequirement of 46 U.S.C. 8102(a) (Watchmen). Section 8102(a) of Title 46states ``The owner, charterer, or managing operator of a vessel carryingpassengers during the nighttime shall keep a suitable number of watchmenin the vicinity of the cabins or staterooms and on each deck to guard againstand give alarm in case of fire or other danger.'' Existing andSection; 185.22.1requires roving patrolmen only when passenger lounge areas below the maindeck are occupied. Proposed andSection; 185.410(a) reiterates the specific statutory requirementfor a small passenger vessel of more than 65 feet in length with overnightaccommodations for more than 150 passengers. Hence, a watchman would haveto be stationed on each deck on such very large small passenger vessels.Other small passenger vessels are only required by proposed andSection; 185.410(b)to have a suitable number of watchmen patrol throughout a vessel duringthe nighttime. A vessel owner must determine the number of watchmen suitablefor the vessel. The OCMI will consider this number when placing minimummanning requirements on the vessel's COI. For most small passenger vesselsone crew member on watch, assigned to periodically patrol throughout thevessel, would be sufficient.The Coast Guard interprets the statutory requirements of 46 U.SC. 8102(a)to permit a roving watchman, as long as each deck is patrolled because:(1) The size of such vessels allows a single watchman to rapidly patrola vessel and guard against and give alarm in case of a fire or other danger;and (2) The proposed requirements in Part 181 for fixed extinguishing systems,fire or smoke detecting systems, and fire alarms, and in Part 182 for bilgelevel alarms, allow remote monitoring for emergency conditions aboard thevessel. The proposed requirement for a watchman will not increase the operatingcost for most small passenger vessels since a crew member already on watchcan be used to periodically patrol the vessel. Most masters already havesuch patrols conducted, even for above deck spaces, for safety purposes.The proposed requirement would result in increased costs for a small passengervessel of more than 65 feet in length with overnight accommodations formore than 150 passengers since a watchman would have to be stationed oneach deck. However, a survey of vessels in the Marine Safety InformationSystem did not reveal any existing small passenger vessels which have overnightaccommodations for more than 150 passengers. <T3>Section 185.502 Crew and passenger lists.</T3> Proposed andSection; 185.502is a new requirement based on 46 U.S.C. 3502 as well as recommendationsmade by both the NTSB and Coast Guard Marine Boards of Investigation. 46U.S.C. 3502 requires the owner, charterer, managing operator, or master,or individual in charge to keep a correct list of passengers that embarkand disembark from day to day on: (1) Vessels arriving from foreign ports (except at U.S. Great Lakes portsfrom Canadian Great Lakes ports); (2) Seagoing vessels in the coastwise trade; and (3) Passenger vessels making voyages of more than 300 miles on the GreatLakes except from a Canadian to a United States port. The NTSB and Coast Guard Marine Boards of Investigations recommended thepreparing and depositing ashore of a list of passengers and crew beforea small passenger vessel gets underway as a result of the following casualties:JOAN LA RIE III, YANKEE, FISH-N-FOOL, MERRY JANE, and SAN MATEO. During the search and rescue operation involving these five casualtiesthere were difficulties in determining how many persons may have been missing.Similar difficulties have occurred following many other casualties. In consideration of 46 U.S.C 3502 and the five casualties mentioned above,the Coast Guard is proposing that the master of a vessel on certain voyagesprepare or have prepared a list of the names of all persons aboard includingcrew, passengers, and non-paying guests. Recommendations have been madethat names and addresses of persons be recorded. To minimize the recordkeeping burden, the proposed regulations only require that the names ofpersons be recorded since that is the primary information needed in anemergency. Additional information may be recorded if desired. The primarypurpose of the list is to identify the number and names of persons on avessel in an emergency, although 46 U.S.C 3502 provides that lists andcounts prepared under the section are open to the inspection of designatedofficials of the Coast Guard and the Customs Service at all times. A crew and passenger list would be prepared for vessels departing on anoceans voyage, a coastwise voyage, or a Great Lakes voyage except a ferryoperating on the Great Lakes on a voyage of less than 30 minutes, overnightvoyages by any vessel with overnight accommodations, and any other vesselsarriving from a foreign port except a Canadian port. The list would berequired to be deposited ashore, prior to a vessel leaving its berth, eitherby being hand carried or by radio or other electronic transmission. Thelist could be left in a well marked lock box at the vessel's departuredock, at an office which is readily identifiable with the vessel such asa company office or a port captain's office at or near the dock, or atanother location of which the owner notifies the OCMI. As a result of the YANKEE casualty, a recommendation was made that a listof names be made and delivered ashore for all vessels making voyages onbays and sounds. The proposed regulations do not require a crew and passengerlist for all vessels on such routes because of the large number of passengersmaking such voyages and the large cost of recording such passengers, thenormally rapid response time for emergencies in most bays and sounds, andthe shorter distance a vessel normally goes from a harbor of safe refugewhen operating only in bays and sounds. However, comments are specificallyrequested on the possible need for passenger lists for operations on allbays and sounds or specific bays and sounds which may present hazards similarto many Great Lakes or coastwise routes. Vessels like the YANKEE, which carry passengers in overnight accommodationspaces, would be required to prepare crew and passenger lists wheneveron overnight voyages, regardless of the route, because of the distancesthey often operate from emergency services on such voyages. Comments are specifically requested on the appropriateness of requiringcrew and passenger lists for most small passenger vessels operating onthe Great Lakes especially in consideration of 46 U.S.C. 3502 which onlymandates such lists for vessels on voyages of more than 300 miles. Listsfor such vessels are proposed based on NTSB recommendations and the hazardoussea conditions periodically experienced on the Great Lakes. The cost of this proposal, which has partially been mandated by law, issignificant. The estimated cost of preparing the proposed required listis $7.60 per year for each person that a small passenger vessel is permittedto carry. <T3>Section 185.504 Passenger count.</T3> Proposed andSection; 185.504 requiresthat the master of a vessel, except those subject to andSection; 185.502,keep a correct, written count of the number of passengers who are receivedor embark on the vessel and are delivered or disembark the vessel. Thisproposal also reflects the requirements of 46 U.S.C. 3502. Although neitherthe law nor the proposed regulation require that a written record of thecount be kept ashore, the depositing of a trip plan ashore including thenumber and names of people aboard the vessel, prior to departure, is anormal safe boating practice. The requirement for a passenger count isnot considered to impose any additional costs to vessel owners because:(1) The records kept by vessel owners on the number of passengers carriedfor revenue purposes may be used to comply with the requirement; and (2) A passenger count is presently required by statute. <T3>Section 185.506 Passenger safety orientation.</T3> Proposed andSection;185.506 requires that before a vessel gets underway with passengers, anaudible announcement must be made to the passengers about safety proceduresand equipment aboard the vessel. Existing andSection; 185.25-1(d) gives themaster of a small passenger vessel the option of making a safety orientationannouncement before getting underway or providing placards which show passengersthe location of life preservers, the proper method of donning them, thetype and location of all lifesaving devices carried, and the location andcontents of the required emergency checkoff list. The existing rule, publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on February 19, 1980 (45 FR 11108), was promptedby the multiple loss of life upon the sinking of the small passenger vesselPEARL C. Since publication of the existing rule, the NTSB and Coast Guard MarineBoards of Investigation have repeatedly recommended that passenger safetyorientations be required to be made by a public announcement and, in somecases, include the actual demonstration of the donning of lifejackets.The recommendations were made as a result of several casualties including,but not limited, to the SAN MATEO, JOAN LA RIE III, MERRY JANE and theFISH-N-FOOL. In all but one of these casualties, public announcements were not madenor were suitable placards provided in accordance with the existing regulations.The Coast Guard agrees that placards alone are insufficient to help ensurepassengers are aware of safety procedures and equipment on a small passengervessel. Placards may often be ignored or go unnoticed by passengers. Informationmore applicable to the passenger clientele aboard a small passenger vesselfor a particular voyage can be better presented in public announcementthan by placards. Public announcements would also ensure that passengerswill be better prepared to respond to the instructions of crew in an emergency.The Golden Gate Fishermen's Association, which represents commercial passengerfishing vessels and marine recreational anglers in Northern California,has strongly urged the Coast Guard to make public safety orientation announcementsmandatory. In response to the notice of proposed rulemaking on the existing regulationon safety orientation (43 FR 28426), five comments were received allegingthat a safety orientation announcement would create fear and panic amongpassengers. The Coast Guard replied then, and continues to emphasize, thateach passenger must be provided with basic information regarding emergencyprocedures and lifesaving equipment. Fear and panic are more logicallya result of lack of information about, familiarity with, and understandingof vessel operations and available equipment. Audible public announcementsand demonstrations are the best way to ensure knowledge and familiarity.The revised safety orientation regulation in this notice would be applicableto all small passenger vessels. The Coast Guard realizes there are manyfactors which affect the ease of making safety orientation announcementson the many different types of small passengers vessels. The proposed rulerequires that ``suitable'' public announcements be made covering specifictopics. The length and detail of the announcement may vary depending onthe type of vessel, equipment, route, and passengers. In view of the timea demonstration would take, a demonstration of the proper donning of alifejacket is required only on vessels going on an ocean or coastwise voyageor transiting a regulated navigation area. Although demonstrations areencouraged, announcements on other vessels need only include simple verbalinstructions on donning of a lifejacket with reference to the lifejacketplacard which would be required by proposed andSection; 185.516.Because mandatory public announcements should not cause any appreciabledelay in a small passenger vessel getting underway, the cost of this proposedrequirement to the small passenger vessel industry is expected to be minimal.<T3>Section 185.508 Wearing of lifejackets. </T3>Proposed andSection; 185.508requires that the master ensure that passengers don lifejackets under certainconditions. This proposed regulation is based upon recommendations of theNTSB following the PEARL C, SAN MATEO, and MERRY JANE casualties. Passengersand crew members suddenly entered the water as a result of the capsizingor near capsizing of these vessels as they crossed hazardous bars. If passengershad been required to wear lifejackets on the MERRY JANE and PEARL C, 18deaths may have been prevented. The emergency checkoff list required to be posted on a small passengervessel by existing andSection; 185.25-5 contains the statement: ``Have passengersput on life preservers if the going becomes very rough or you are aboutto cross a hazardous bar.'' This statement on the checkoff list servesto remind the crew and passengers of the type of situations when lifejacketsshould be worn. However, existing Subchapter T does not contain a specificrequirement on when lifejackets must be worn. The master of a vessel is primarily responsible for operational decisionsaffecting the safety of the vessel and its passengers. This normally includesthe responsibility to determine when sea conditions or the condition ofthe vessel are hazardous enough to require the donning of lifejackets todecrease possible risks. However, certain conditions are predictably hazardousenough to require the donning of lifejackets. Proposed andSection; 185.508(a) requires a master to have passengers donlifejackets when such possible hazardous conditions exist. Such hazardousconditions include: Transiting a bar or inlet through dangerous swellsor breaking waves; severe weather; a fire or flooding which could leadto evacuating the vessel; and when the vessel is being towed. Consideration was given to proposing that passengers also be required todon lifejackets when a small passenger vessel is within a regulated navigationarea under certain conditions, as designated in 33 CFR Part 165, SubpartF. Coast Guard District Commanders would designate the conditions and areas.However, since District Commanders are already authorized by 33 CFR 165.11(b)to establish operating conditions for vessels in an area which is determinedto have hazardous conditions, it is not necessary to repeat this authorizationin Subchapter T. The cost of the requirements in proposed andSection; 185.508 to the smallpassenger vessel industry would be negligible, since the regulation wouldimpose no additional equipment or time requirements on a vessel. <T3>Section 185.510 Emergency instructions. </T3>Proposed andSection; 185.510requires the posting of an Emergency Instructions placard with contentssimilar to those in the recommended emergency checkoff list required byexisting andSection; 185.25-1(b). The proposed regulation emphasizes thatthe emergency instructions must address the particular needs of each individualvessel. Recommended emergency checkoff lists posted on an existing vesselwill be acceptable as emergency instructions under the proposed regulationproviding the lists contain instructions applicable to the vessel. <T3>Section 185.514 Station bill. </T3>Proposed andSection; 185.514 requiresa crew station bill on certain large vessels. This proposal mandates that``very large'' small passenger vessels with overnight accommodations formore than 49 passengers comply with the requirements of 46 CFR Subpart78.13 on the content of a station bill, assignment of duties, emergencysignals, an emergency squad, and instructions. Compliance with 46 CFR Subpart78.13 is necessary due to the length of the voyage and actual size of suchvessels, the number of passengers and crew members, and the complexityof bilge, fire protection, and lifesaving systems. Presently, NVIC 11-83indicates that the requirements of 46 CFR 78.13 are normally applied to``very large'' small passenger vessels with overnight accommodations formore than 50 passengers. Other small passenger vessels, which do not normally sail on overnightvoyages, should also have station bills for the crew because of their sizeand complexity. Station bills can be required by the OCMI or the Commandanton such vessels under existing andSection; 175.05-1(b) or andSection; 175.05-15(b).Requiring, by regulation, that specific vessels have station bills willreduce the inconsistencies that occur among marine inspection zones. Thenumber of crew members on a vessel is a primary factor in determining whatvessel needs a crew station bill. On a vessel with a small crew, the master should be able to direct theactions of the other crew members in an emergency, providing that the crewmembers have been properly trained and instructed. With small crews, eachcrew member may have to perform a variety of functions, and it would beimpractical to specify all those functions on one station bill. For vesselswith larger crews, a station bill is both beneficial and necessary. Ascrew size increases, it becomes more difficult for the master to assignduties to each crew member as an emergency occurs. With a large crew, greaterspecialization of response action is also possible. Therefore, the CoastGuard is proposing that a station bill be posted on all vessels of morethan 65 feet in length with a required crew of more than four persons,including the master. A station bill on such vessels will reduce confusionand the time it takes crew members to respond in an emergency. The contents of the station bill for a vessel with a crew of four personswould not be as detailed as the bill for a ``very large'' small passengervessel with overnight accommodations for more than 49 passengers. Fourcrew members was chosen as the breakpoint since most vessels with fourcrew members include two licensed individuals, who should be qualifiedin emergency response, and two deckhands. As the number of crew membersincreases above four, the percentage of crew qualified in emergency responsedecreases and the need for assigned responsibilities increases. <T3>Section 185.515 Passenger safety bill. </T3>Proposed andSection; 185.515requires a passenger safety bill and proposed andSection; 185.516 requiresinstructions on lifejacket use to be posted in passenger staterooms orcabins on ``very large'' small passenger vessels with overnight accommodationsfor more than 49 passengers. Vessels which are subject to 46 CFR SubchapterH, including small passenger vessels to which NVIC 11-83 is applicable,must presently have stateroom notices on emergency actions and lifejacketuse for passengers. The NTSB emphasized the need for such notices followingthe YANKEE_HARPER TAPPER collision in 1983. The required contents of passengersafety bills, listed in proposed andSection; 185.515, are more applicableto ``very large'' small passenger vessels than the contents of stateroomnotices required by andSection; 78.47-7 of Subchapter H. <T3>Section 185.516 Lifejacket placards. </T3>Proposed andSection; 185.516requires that lifejacket placards be posted in conspicuous places on allsmall passenger vessels. The lifejacket placards are needed to help orientpassengers in the use of lifejackets. The estimated cost of this requirementfor each small passenger vessel is $10.00. <T3>Section 185.518 Inflatable liferaft placard. </T3>Proposed andSection;185.518 requires that, on each vessel equipped with inflatable liferafts,instruction placards on the use of the rafts be posted on each raft andin conspicuous places in the vessel. This proposal is a new requirementonly for those vessels which would be required, for the first time, tohave inflatable liferafts by proposed Subpart E of Part 180. Existing andSection;185.25-7 requires the posting of instruction placards in conspicuous placeson all vessels equipped with liferafts. Additionally, all approved liferaftsare required to have instructions posted on them in accordance with 46CFR 160.051-8(b). The posting of instruction placards for liferafts in conspicuous placesis necessary so that passengers and crew can become familiar with the raftsprior to an emergency. However, on vessels where rafts are stowed in areasaccessible to passengers and where the instruction placards on the raftcontainers are readily visible, additional placards in other locationson the vessel may not be necessary. The estimated cost of this requirementon applicable small passenger vessels is $10.00 per vessel. <T3>Sections 185.520 and 185.524 Drills, instructions, and training. </T3>ProposedandSection;andSection; 185.520 and 185.524 revise existing andSection; 185.25-10(Drills) by providing minimum standards for training and drills. Presently,masters on all small passenger vessels are required to conduct drills andinstructions to ensure all crew members are familiar with their duties.NVIC 11-83 states that 46 CFR 78.17, which contains specific fire and boatdrill requirements, is normally applied to ``very large'' small passengervessels with overnight accommodations for more than 50 passengers. Proposed andSection; 185.520(b) includes minimum intervals at which abandonship drills must be held on vessels having more than four survival craftand on ``very large'' small passenger vessels with overnight accommodationsfor more than 49 passengers. The masters of other vessels must still determinehow often such drills are necessary on their vessels, but it is still mandatoryto periodically hold drills. Four survival craft is used as a breakpointsince as a vessel exceeds that number it becomes increasingly more difficultfor a master to direct an evacuation and evacuation takes more time. Therefore,it becomes more imperative that each crew member know his job. Establishingthese minimum intervals will give the master a baseline to determine whatdrill interval is sufficient for his vessel. Proposed andSection; 185.520(c) specifies what an abandon ship drill mustinclude. It also requires the summoning of passengers on any vessel onan overnight voyage in order to give the crew experience handling passengersin an emergency, as well as to provide passengers a better safety orientation.Proposed andSection; 185.520(e) requires the actual use of rescue boats,when installed, during periodic man overboard drills. These proposed regulationson abandon ship, man overboard, and fire drills do not impose any new costto small passenger vessels since the proposed regulations only list minimumstandards for drills presently required. <T3>Section 185.602_Hull Markings. </T3>Proposed andSection; 185.602 containssome requirements not presently contained in Subchapter T. Proposed paragraph(b) of this section requires draft or loading marks on all vessels on whicha stability analysis must be done under Parts 170 and 171 of SubchapterS in accordance with proposed andSection; 178.310.Draft marks are presently required only on a small passenger vessel ofat least 79 feet in length, the keel of which was laid on or after July21, 1968, on a foreign voyage. Draft marks or loading marks are necessaryto assist the master in ensuring a small passenger vessel complies withthe draft and trim requirements listed on the vessel's stability letter.This requirement is expected to cost approximately $80.00 per vessel. Paragraph (d) of proposed andSection; 185.602 requires that a small passengervessel with more than one passenger deck post, at the entranceways to upperdecks, any limits imposed by the vessel's stability letter on the numberof passengers allowed on those decks. This proposed requirement incorporatesthe existing policy of many OCMIs and is not expected to impose any coston the small passenger vessel industry. <T3>Section 185.604 Lifesaving equipment markings. </T3>Proposed andSection;185.604 requires changes in the size of markings on some lifesaving equipment.The same lifesaving markings will be required by proposed Subchapter W.This section proposes that each rescue boat and ring buoy be marked withretroreflective material to improve the ability to locate rescue boatsand ring buoys in darkness. This requirement will also be included in proposedSubchapter W. The retroreflective material is expected to cost approximately$29.00 per rescue boat and $12.00 per ring buoy. Equipment on existingvessels would not have to be marked with the proposed markings until existingmarkings are no longer legible. Under the proposal, retroreflective material would have to be installedon lifejackets, rescue boats, and ring lifebuoys in accordance with thearrangements specified by a proposed International Maritime Organization(IMO) resolution. The resolution, entitled ``Installation of ReflectiveTape on Lifesaving Equipment,'' is expected to be adopted by IMO in November,1989. The advantage of incorporating this resolution by reference is thatit will contain easily understood drawings indicating the required arrangementfor retroreflective material. The arrangement of retroreflective material required by the proposed IMOresolution is very similar to the arrangement of retroreflective materialrequired on life preservers by existing andSection; 180.25-25 and as recommendedby the U.S. Coast Guard Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC)01-87. If the proposed resolution is not adopted prior to issuance of thefinal rule under this docket, the Coast Guard intends to include specificregulations in Subchapter T on the arrangement of retroreflective tapebased on existing andSection; 180.25-25 and NVIC 01-87. <T3>Subpart G_Operational Readiness. </T3>This subpart proposes minimumstandards for the care of lifesaving equipment. It requires that ownersand managing operators have the manufacturer's instruction manuals forcertain lifesaving equipment manufactured after the effective date of theregulations available for use. Vessels of more than 65 feet in length musthave the manuals aboard, since such vessels have sufficient storage spaceand may often go on extended voyages on which a master may need the instructionson the repair or maintenance of equipment. Specific maintenance and inspectionintervals, which owners and managing operators should already be followingas good marine practice, are also proposed. This proposed section imposesno additional costs itself as the cost of maintaining any new equipmentrequired on a small passenger vessel, such as an inflatable liferaft, hasbeen calculated in the cost of the equipment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Distribution Table </ITAG>The following is a distribution table indicating where existing requirementsin Subchapters S and T have been moved to, or if they have been deleted,by this proposal.

The average annual cost to the small passenger vesselindustry of the proposed changes is estimated to be $8.5 million per yearin 1987 dollars. Included in the total average annual cost are increasedcosts from proposed requirements as well as monetary benefits primarilydue to cost savings from: 1. Reduced fire damage due to increased fire protection equipment; 2. Extended drydocking intervals; 3. Reduced structural fire protection requirements; 4. Greater flexibility in the choice of structural fire protection materialsand piping materials; and 5. Reduced insurance premiums from fixed total flooding fire extinguishingsystems, fire detecting systems, and smoke detecting systems. The proposed regulations would result in an overall increased cost, forthe initial purchase and outfitting of a new, small passenger vessel, ofapproximately $1500 to $94,000 per vessel depending upon the vessel's operationand number of passengers permitted to be carried. The total net presentvalue of the proposed changes is $85 million. Time phasing and discounting were used to determine the Net Present Value(NPV) and Average Annual Cost (AAC). Discounting recognizes that futurecosts or benefits are not worth the same amount at the present time, andthat the relationship between monetary values at different points in timeis the interest rate or discount factor. The NPV is the total value ofall future costs and benefits from this proposal on the effective dateof the regulations. To calculate the NPV the regulations were assumed tobe effective for a planning period of 100 years. Each year's expected yearlycost was multiplied by a discount factor and summed over all years of theplanning period. The AAC is the NPV discounted over all the years of theplanning period, producing equal annual costs. For the evaluation the averagelife of a small passenger vessel was estimated to be twenty-five years.More than 70 individual changes from the existing regulations were identifiedin this proposal as being monetary cost/benefit items. The most significantof these items were: 1. Liferafts and inflatable buoyant apparatus ($5.6 million AAC); 2. Passenger/crew lists ($1.04 million AAC); 3. Category 1 EPIRBs for vessels on oceans and coastwise routes ($0.4 millionAAC); and 4. Fixed total flooding fire extinguishing systems in machinery spaces($0.37 million AAC). A discussion of the individual cost or monetary benefit of many proposedchanges is included in the Discussion of Proposed Regulations. Tables listingthe primary changes proposed in this notice, which would result in a costor monetary benefit to a small passenger vessel owner, are also includedbelow. For the convenience of the reader, a cost and monetary benefit tableis provided for four sample small passenger vessels which vary by length,passenger capacity, route, and accommodation type. The estimated cost ofthe proposed changes, which are listed in the tables, are based on informationfrom small passenger vessel owners, builders, equipment vendors, and marineequipment catalogs, and include estimated initial outfitting costs andthe annual recurring costs. Outfitting costs include the initial purchaseprice and installation charge for new equipment.

Although the directcost may be considered large, the need for and benefits of the proposedregulations justify the cost.The primary benefit of the proposed regulations is that they are expectedto reduce the number of lives lost, and injuries and property damage sustained,as a result of casualties involving small passenger vessels. This primarybenefit can not be readily calculated in monetary terms. Some of the requirementsproposed by this rulemaking for which the full monetary benefit of therequirement can not be easily quantified include: liferafts and inflatablebuoyant apparatus, EPIRBs, fixed total flooding fire extinguishing systems,fire detecting systems, and passenger and crew lists.Based on available small passenger vessel casualty data from 1981 to 1986,the proposed requirements for inflatable liferafts and buoyant apparatusare expected to save two lives per year. The proposed requirement thatpassengers be required to wear lifejackets under certain conditions isalso expected to save two lives per year. The valuation of human life isquite difficult and often undesirable. However, to compare the benefitof the proposed requirements for liferafts and inflatable buoyant apparatus,and the wearing of lifejackets under certain conditions, to the averageannual cost of this rulemaking, the value of a human life must be estimated.Economists have estimated the value of a human life ranges from a minimumof $1 million to $11 million. If a human life is estimated to have a monetaryvalue of at least $2.125 million, the benefit to cost ratio of the proposedrequirements would be one. The average annual cost of this rulemaking wouldbe reduced from $8.5 million to no cost due to the four lives expectedto be saved per year from these lifesaving equipment requirements alone.Fortunately, a United States small passenger vessel carrying a large numberof passengers has not been involved to date in a major casualty resultingin a significant number of injuries or deaths. As available statisticsindicate, the average size of small passenger vessels is increasing. Asthe average size increases, the risk of having a catastrophic casualtyalso increases.The existing regulations do not adequately address the continual increasein the number of persons being carried on small passenger vessels today.This continual increase emphasizes the need for the proposed regulations.One casualty involving a small passenger vessel carrying a large numberof passengers, which involves a large fire or results in passengers enteringthe water, would dramatically increase the number of lives saved by equipmentand procedures required by the proposed regulations. The number of livessaved by the proposed regulations for survival craft and the donning oflifejackets alone would be much more than the estimated average, basedon recent casualty data, of four lives per year.The proposals for liferafts and inflatable buoyant apparatus are basedon the recognition of the potential for a tragic accident involving a largenumber of passengers as well as the number of deaths which have occurredin the past. Because of the high cost of survival craft, alternatives tothe proposed requirements were extensively considered. The proposed regulationsfor survival craft were determined to be the best balance of number ofpersons at risk, the threat due to hypothermia, and cost.The proposal to require Category 1 EPIRBs on all small passenger vesselspresently required to have EPIRBs, as well as on vessels on coastwise routeswithin 20 miles of a harbor of safe refuge, is based upon the improvedsignals that the new Category 1 EPIRBs transmit and recognition that manycasualties occur close to shore without an adequate distress signal beingtransmitted. The proposed requirements for Category 1 EPIRBs would improverescue response by reducing delays and increasing the accuracy of the signallocation. The costs to search and rescue units would be decreased becausesuch units would have to spend less time responding and also because ofan expected reduction in the number of false alarms which must be trackeddown. False alarms from Category 1 EPIRBs are less likely and easier totrace than from the presently required Class A EPIRBs. These benefits ofthe proposed requirement for Category 1 EPIRBs are difficult to quantify.The proposal that fixed total flooding fire extinguishing systems be installedin enclosed machinery spaces on all vessels was based upon the large numberof casualties involving machinery space fires and the relatively inexpensivecost of these systems for most small passenger vessels. The monetary benefitof such systems due to reduced fire damage and insurance premiums, whichcan be quantified, has been included in the average annual cost. Some insuranceindustry estimates indicate that fixed total flooding fire extinguishingsystems actually ``pay for themselves'' in three to ten years due to reducedinsurance premiums. Smoke detecting systems also result in reduced insurancepremiums.Smoke detecting systems are considered essential for ensuring early detectionof a fire, which leads to more organized and effective firefighting andevacuation responses. Organized and effective responses are of particularconcern for the vessels subject to the proposed requirement for smoke detectingsystems, which includes vessels carrying more than 150 passengers, becauseof the large numbers of people at risk. The installation of these detectingsystems is also considered necessary in order to allow reduced structuralfire protection. A monetary benefit from smoke detecting systems due toreduced fire damage can not be determined. However, a rapid response toone fire detected by smoke detecting systems aboard a small passenger vesselcarrying more than 150 passengers would justify the expense of such systems.The proposed regulations for passenger and crew lists stem from requirementsin the law. The need for such lists is bolstered by recommendations fromNTSB and Coast Guard casualty reports. The lists will provide search andrescue personnel with the number and identity of persons missing in theevent of a casualty. Often in such situations these details are difficultto determine with any degree of certainty which makes it difficult to determinewhen to suspend a search. The monetary benefit of such lists is difficultto estimate but such lists would reduce the time it takes for search andrescue personnel to determine how many persons are missing and result inmore efficient use of resources.A draft evaluation has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket.The evaluation contains information on the methodology and data sourcesused in determining costs and benefits, details on the costs and benefitsof each change, alternatives to proposed changes, costs for sample smallpassenger vessels, and a profile of the small passenger fleet and its casualtyhistory. For information concerning inspecting and copying the draft evaluation,refer to <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>above. Copies may also be received by contacting theperson listed under <T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</T2>.Based on the draft evaluation, the proposed regulations are consideredto be non-major under Executive Order 12291 and nonsignificant under theDepartment of Transportation regulatory polices and procedures (44 FR 11034,February 26, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact</ITAG>This rulemaking has been thoroughly reviewed by the Coast Guard and ithas been determined to be categorically excluded from further environmentaldocumentation in accordance with section 2.B.2.c and 2.B.2.1 of CommandantInstruction (COMDTINST) M16475.1B. A categorical Exclusion Determinationstatement has been prepared and has been placed in the rulemaking docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), the CoastGuard must consider whether this rule is likely to have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' includeindependently owned and operated small businesses which are not dominantin their field and which would otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns''under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).A large percentage of small passenger vessels are owned or managed by smallentities. The annual costs per passenger capacity (using the maximum numberof passengers permitted to be carried as indicated on a vessel's Certificateof Inspection) ranges from $5 for a vessel of not more than 65 feet inlength carrying more than 49 passengers on a river route to $70 for a vesselof more than 65 feet in length, which has overnight accommodations formore than 49 passengers, on a coastwise route. As the passenger capacityincreases on each type of vessel, the cost per passenger decreases. Existingvessels have lower costs since they need not comply with some proposedregulations and are allowed delayed retrofitting of equipment requiredby other proposed regulations.To evaluate the impact the proposed regulations would have on an ownerof a small passenger vessel, the increase in ticket prices that an ownerwould have to charge for trips on four sample vessels, which are most representativeof the small passenger fleet, was determined. An owner of the followingsample vessels could recover the cost of the proposed regulations by increasingthe passenger ticket price by the indicated amount if the vessel made 100trips per year at 50% capacity:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s100,8</C> <H1>Vessel</H1><H1>Price Increase</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1. Not more than 65 feet in length, carrying 57 passengers, on a riverroute<D>$0.03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2. More than 65 feet, carrying 310 passengers, on a lakes, bays andsounds, route <D>0.65</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3. Not more than 65 feet in length carrying 23 passengers, on an oceanroute<D>1.90</D></ITAG></ITAG>The owner of an average ``very large'' small passenger vessel of more than65 feet in length having overnight accommodations for 102 passengers, ona coastwise route, could recover the costs of the proposed regulationsby increasing the charge to a passenger by $1.93 if the vessel made 32trips per year at 50% capacity. The estimated cost of a ticket for a 1week trip on such vessels is more than $700 per week.Small passenger vessel owners would need to increase the charge to eachpassenger carried on a voyage a minimal amount to recover the costs ofthese proposed regulations. The three cents ticket price increase for thevessel on a rivers route is considered to be insignificant. The ticketprice increase of a $1.90 for the vessel on an oceans route and of $0.65for the vessel on a lakes, bays, and sounds route is also considered tobe insignificant since the existing ticket price for a trip on such a vesselmay be as much as $25 for a day trip. The estimated per ticket price increasesfor the average vessel on an oceans route is expected to be less than 8%of the present ticket price. Ninety percent ($1.72) of the cost increasefor a vessel on an oceans route is due to the proposed requirement forliferafts alone. The estimated per ticket price increase for the averagevessel on a lakes, bays, and sounds route is expected to be less than 5%of the present ticket price. The average vessel on an oceans route or alakes, bays, and sounds route usually operates at a higher usage levelthan the 100 trips per year at 50% capacity, which was assumed for theprice increase calculations. The increase in ticket price for the averagevessel on a coastwise route, which does not carry more than 49 passengersin overnight accommodations, will be less than the price increase for asimilar vessel on an oceans route. The $1.93 ticket price increase forthe vessel carrying 102 passengers in overnight accommodations is alsoconsidered insignificant since the price increase is estimated to be lessthan 1% of the average ticket price for a trip on such a vessel.In addition to the four sample vessels, the effect of the proposed regulationson other vessel categories was also considered to determine which typeof small passenger vessel the regulations would have the greatest impacton. The type of vessel for which the regulations would have the greatestcost impact are vessels on oceans or coastwise routes which are permittedto carry only a few more passengers than the maximum of six which may becarried on uninspected vessels. This group of vessels is primarily composedof sport fishing vessels, which carry passengers on chartered trips. Someof these are only operated on a part time basis. The owners of vesselsoperated part time would be impacted the most since such vessels make onlya limited number of trips from which they can recover the cost of the proposedregulations. The exact number of sport fishing vessels operated on a parttime basis is unknown but estimated to be small.The reason that the sport fishing vessels are impacted the most by theregulations is because approximately 80 percent of the cost increase fora vessel operating on an oceans, coastwise, or Great Lakes route is dueto the proposed requirement for liferafts and inflatable buoyant apparatus.The per passenger impact of the requirement for inflatable survival craftincreases as the passenger capacity of a vessel decreases.Smaller capacity survival craft, which would be installed on a sport fishingvessel, cost more on a per person basis than large capacity survival craft.To estimate the cost impact of the proposed regulations on a sport fishingvessel, which is operated only part time, a vessel was assumed to makeonly 40 trips per year with an average of 8 passengers per trip. Basedon these assumptions, the owner of a sport fishing vessel operated on apart time basis, could recover the cost of the proposed regulations byincreasing the individual passenger ticket price by $3.50 or the vesselcharter price by $28 per trip. Sport fishing vessels commonly charge $350to $400 for each trip chartered. An increase of $28 would be a 7% increase;an amount which should not have a significant impact on the owners of sportfishing vessels. Based on the minimal amount an owner of a small passenger vessel wouldhave to increase a passenger ticket price to recover the cost of the proposedregulations, as discussed above, the Coast Guard has determined that thisproposed rulemaking will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism </ITAG>This proposed rulemaking has been analyzed in accordance with the principlesand criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determinedthat this proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implicationsto warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>This rulemaking contains information collection requirements in the followingsections of 46 CFR: 176.105(a), 176.202, 176.204, 176.302, 176.306, 176.310,176.500(a), 176.612, 176.700, 176.704, 176.710, 176.810(b), 176.920(c),176.930, 176.932(b), 177.202, 177.330(b), 177.340, 177.610(e), 178.210,178.220, 178.230, 181.610, 182.460(e), 182.610, 183.320, 184.420, 184.506,185.202, 185.206, 185.208, 185.220, 185.230, 185.260, 185.280, 185.282,185.304(c), 185.402, 185.502, 185.504, 185.506 185.510, 185.514, 185.515,185.516, 185.518, 185.602, 185.604, 185.606, 185.608, 185.610, 185.612,185.702, 185.704(c), 185.810.
