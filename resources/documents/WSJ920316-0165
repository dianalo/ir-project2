Both items spotlight thedanger that comes from the international market forconventional arms -- aircraft, tanks, artillery,surface-to-air missiles, surface-to-surface missiles andnaval ships. Hyperactivity in the arms market will hinder, ifnot defeat, efforts to sustain stable military balances invarious regions of the world. It is also likely that armstrade may become a delicate issue in relations between Russiaand the U.S. -- the two largest suppliers.   In the last years of the 1980s and the start of the 1990s,global arms sales amounted to between $45 billion and $50billion a year. Some indicators suggest this enormous volumewill decrease. For one, Iraq's 1980s-level arms purchaseshave been discontinued, if not terminated. For another, thebuying power of Third World arms importers is restricted bysoft prices and reduced earnings from oil exports, competingdemands to finance domestic economic development, andgenerally tight conditions in capital markets.</LP><TEXT>   These tempering influences, however, are being offset byother factors, resulting in a continued high level ofactivity in the arms market. On the supply side, theseinclude pressures in the defense industries of the U.S. andother supplier countries to expand exports to partiallycompensate for declining defense budgets at home. On thedemand side, ethnic and irredentist conflicts in the Mideast,Eastern Europe and South Asia mean higher imports.   In recent years, the former Soviet Union was the largestarms seller, with about 40%, or $20 billion, of annualworld-wide sales. Only a third of this amount, about $6billion, represented hard-currency sales -- the remainder wastypically financed by soft, long-term ruble loans that havebeen, and are likely to remain, unrequited. The U.S. has beenthe second largest seller, with about 20% of the globaltotal, or $10 to $11 billion annually.   In October, the five principal arms suppliers -- France,China, Britain, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, nowprincipally Russia -- agreed upon a nonbinding arms tradeprotocol. Under the agreement, signatories will maintain aregistry of information on arms exports and will make seriousefforts at restraint. Specifically, these so-calledfirst-tier suppliers have agreed to avoid weapons transfersthat would &quot;aggravate an existing armed conflict . . .increase tension . . . or introduce destabilizing militarycapabilities.&quot;   Aside from its other limitations -- namely, its nonbindingcharacter and its emphasis on good intentions rather thanenforcement mechanisms -- the October protocol is impaired byits failure to consider the &quot;second-tier&quot; arms suppliers,notably Brazil, India, Israel, North and South Korea.Restraint by the main suppliers might actually encouragesecond-tier suppliers to fill the breach. And prospectivearms buyers might seek arms from second-tier suppliers tosubstitute for weapons systems that might become harder toobtain from first-tier suppliers. (Of course, it is not clearthat first-tier suppliers will curtail arms exports.)   There are other considerations that offer even more causefor worry. As the U.S. defense budget declines, procurementspending -- which has typically been about 30% to 35% oftotal defense spending -- will encounter particularly severerestraints. The Defense Department has already said thatfuture defense budgets will place more emphasis on research,development, testing and evaluation and less on procurement.This policy is aimed at building &quot;shelf&quot; capabilities, ratherthan deployed ones. Moreover, procurement orders probablywill be for relatively small production runs. These newpolicies give U.S. defense firms stronger incentives to looktoward sales abroad as a means of defraying the fixed costsof development and the smaller production runs at home.   Russia, and, to a lesser extent, Ukraine and Kazakhstan,face particularly complex choices. Their economies' need forhard currency is compelling. Compared with Russia's otherpotential exports, weapons is one area in which Russia has acomparative advantage.   What should U.S. policy be? One option is simply to acceptRussian competition, with the expectation thathigher-performance American weapons will predominate in themarketplace. However, while American suppliers may feelconfident that their established clients in the Middle Eastand elsewhere will continue to prefer American arms for thepresent, the progress of marketization in Russia may make theRussian brands competitive on cost and quantity grounds inthe future.   The second, and better, option is for the U.S. to endorse,and try to enforce, binding limitations on the global armstrade. This would incur opposition from the American defenseindustry, as well as probable breaches and evasions by firmsand governments of the other supplier countries.   There is nevertheless an important reason for endorsingthis second approach. With the dissolution of the SovietUnion, the U.S. faces few if any adversaries with thecapability to provide their own military equipment.Adversaries that the U.S. may someday encounter will dependalmost entirely on the international weapons market to meettheir needs -- for example, on suppliers of Scud missilesfrom North Korea and even more advanced systems from otherpotential suppliers. Hence, control or regulation of thatmarket offers the possibility of significantly limiting theextent to which there are nations capable of posing threatsto vital U.S. interests. For this reason, too, developingmechanisms for such control and regulation should be anessential part of U.S. strategy for the new world order.   ---   Mr. Wolf is dean of the RAND Graduate School and directorof economic research in RAND's National Defense ResearchInstitute.</TEXT></DOC>
