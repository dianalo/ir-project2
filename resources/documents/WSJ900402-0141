But where do you put itall when you get it home?   The solution is to shop a little more, according to agrowing group of retailers who specialize in so-calledorganization materials, items designed to tidy every inch ofthe home and office.</LP><TEXT>   Organizing stores are sprouting in upscale shopping areasin California and along the East Coast, and some retailershave expanded nationwide via direct-mail catalogs. Mosttarget affluent consumers by emphasizing efficiency and timemanagement, as well as home and hearth.   The businesses feed off demographic and cultural shiftsthat are likely to shape the 1990s. Women who cleaned upafter the family a generation ago are out working. The numberof households is increasing as average household sizeshrinks, meaning more but smaller residences. And as asociety, Americans are probably the most acquisitive peoplein history.   &quot;We're in an accumulation mode that knows no bounds,&quot; saysStephanie Culp, an organizing consultant and a foundingmember of the National Association of ProfessionalOrganizers. &quot;So people find themselves in a terrible spacecrunch.&quot;   Hold Everything, a retail and catalog seller of organizinggoods, plans an ambitious national expansion this year. KentC. Larson, president of Williams-Sonoma Inc., the SanFrancisco kitchenware merchant that owns the business,attributes the boom in part to soaring real estate prices anda tendency for people to entertain and relax at home. HoldEverything, which started as a small catalog in 1982, plansto open stores in New York, Washington and other Easterncities to complement its expanding chain in the West.   The nascent organizing business is also taking advantageof a retailing shift. Much of what they stock is designed tocomplement personal computers, electronic entertainmentcomponents and other modern inventions. But other goods arelow-tech housekeeping staples from the 1940s and 1950s, suchas coated wire cupboard shelves and sweater drying racks --items once found in department store notions sections, drygoods stores and five-and-dime stores, which have virtuallydied out in many areas of the country.   Maynard Hale Lyndon and Lu Wendel Lyndon, architecturaldesign specialists, say much has changed since they foundedthe Placewares chain in Boston in 1977. Consumers are moreinterested in recycling and efficient use of resources, Mr.Lyndon says, and American manufacturers are finally producingquality products once exclusively designed in Europe.Placewares, which just opened it seventh New England store,also sells via catalog and is planning further growth.   Lillian Vernon Corp., the specialty catalog concern,reports that some of its longtime storage and organizationitems such as newspaper racks and recycling aids havesuddenly surged in popularity.   Although the organizing business doesn't have any firmstatistics of its own, the National Housewares ManufacturersAssociation says the general categories of bath, laundry,closet and storage wares in 1988 accounted for about 4.6% ofthe $35.2 billion of housewares sales, or a total of about$1.62 billion.   An organizing store's inventory generally includeskitchen, utility room, bathroom, garage and home officeitems, and occasionally furniture and tableware as well. Butsome, such as Organizer's Paradise in Los Angeles, take aneven broader approach, pitching their stores as stylishoutlets where shoppers can buy anything from modular cupboardorganizers to a $4,000 electric blue ultrasuede swing settee.&quot;There was a real void in the market for upscale products,&quot;says Sandy Chism, who along with her daughter, Christi, runsthree stores in the fashionable Westwood, Beverly Hills andWest Hollywood areas.   Merchants who haven't organized their own business plansin the new field may find a closet full of problems --pricing being a big one. Many organization stores offer suchsticker-shock inducers as $25 plastic sock storage boxes and$8 assortments of decorative paper clips.   Home-improvement stores, hardware stores and discountstores are beginning to stock more organizing items, often atprices that specialty stores can't match. The specialtystores figure they can overcome the price gap by offeringhigher quality and better selection and focusing on smallerorganizing niches.   As with any new retailing concept, experts note, targetingthe right customers can be crucial to success.   &quot;A retailer is going to have higher sales and faster{merchandise turnover} if the focus is on one area,&quot; saysMarcia Aaron, a specialty retail analyst with MontgomerySecurities in San Francisco. By moving too far into otherareas such as furniture or other housewares, retailers candilute their customer base.   Ms. Aaron says the organizing and storage market has beenunderserved up to now. &quot;But there are a lot of people tryingto get in,&quot; she says. &quot;And eventually, some will have to pullout because it's just too competitive.&quot;   Retailers say it can be a challenge to make people see aneed for organization wares. &quot;Most people just don't goaround thinking, `I really need a laundry-room organizer,'&quot;says a sales clerk at a Los Angeles-area store. &quot;But once youget them in here, you can't get them out.&quot;   Many shoppers agree. &quot;You get caught up,&quot; says MaraSlutsky of Boston, a customer at Placewares. She bought ashower organizer and colored hooks for the bathroom, and saysshe had to restrain herself from buying &quot;everythingimaginable.&quot;   Ms. Slutsky's only criticism of the merchandise is acommon one among several firms' customers: &quot;After a while,everything looks alike,&quot; she says of the sleek,modern-looking wares. Nonetheless, she says, she plansanother shopping spree when she moves to a new apartment.   Lori Lavin, a West Los Angeles resident, gushes over themerchandise in a new 13,000-square-foot Organizer's Paradisestore as she wheels a wire shopping cart piled withcontemporary black desktop items and colorful kitchengadgets. In two visits, she says, she's plunked down morethan $130 to update her closets, kitchen and desk. &quot;I don'thave the time to dig through a lot of junk,&quot; she says of hercleanup efforts.   That, retailers say, is an important selling point. &quot;Mostpeople who are space-conscious are time-sensitive as well,&quot;says Carol Fraser, director of the Hold Everything catalog.The stores tap into the same mentality that has madeenormous, multisectioned diary planners such a hit.   Some say that the merchandise appeals to customers becauseit allows them to attribute their sloppiness to a technical,rather than a personal, flaw. &quot;You're not buying a crutch foryour character,&quot; says Dr. Jerald Jellison, a psychologyprofessor at the University of Southern California. &quot;You justdon't have the right equipment&quot; to be neat.</TEXT></DOC>
