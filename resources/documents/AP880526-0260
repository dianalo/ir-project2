That, of course, is one of the problems. Trading byinstitutions, not of the mental sort as suggested by the jest, butmutual funds, pension funds and the like, have come to dominate themarketplace.   Not only are they large, but often they think and act alike,producing a combination that can change the market's direction onwhat might otherwise seem to be insignificant news. In a sense, themarket can trip over a pebble.   However, institutions are probably but one of several reasonsfor the frenzies, fads, flipflops and phobias that seem to grip themarket. Technology, financial journalism, economic uncertainty andinternationalization also are factors.   That is the contention of economist John Tuccillo who, thoughhis specialty is real estate _ he is National Association ofRealtors senior vice president _ has produced one of the mostcogent explanations of current market behavior.   In the past, he states, panics occurred infrequently. From 1907to 1929, for example, there was almost nothing to rate thedesignation. Now, we see big changes in stocks, interest rates,currency values and more on a weekly basis.   In explanation, he cites five factors:   _Big block trading. Stock and bond price indexes are weightedaverages of daily trades, and they are watched closely by mutualand pension funds and other big institutional players.   Since institutions, as opposed to individuals, now dominate themarket, even slight changes in indexes can causes a great deal ofweight to be thrown around, simply because of the size of thetrades.   _Computerization has given even more weight to the activities ofthese large traders, most of whom use computers to signal theproper time to buy and sell.   The problem, says Tuccillo, is that ``all the programs give offthe same signals.'' When the market moves, ``technology will giveit a further momentum,'' turning what might have been small swingsinto avalanches.   _With the proliferation of financial television shows andnewspapers there has been increasing competition for stories.   ``So, just as TV news has made stars of tin-horn felons andobscure rebellions, TV financial news has made stars out ofstatistics and even (ugh!) economists.''   Should traders care about the monthly trade numbers? No, saysTuccillo. ``Monthly numbers are unreliable and the true picture isshown only annually.'' Do they care? ``Probably a lot.'' Why? ``Thefinancial media tell them to.''   ``The result is a jittery market that hangs on the arithmetic ofobscure bureaucrats.''   _The crash of October 1987 so shattered confidence that mostplayers don't know what to believe.   ``Hence, they soar on a `good' numbers and crash on a `bad' one.And it doesn't help that the media produce reams of instantanalysis.''   _Internationalization. Financial markets now trade around theclock. What happens in Tokyo and London affects markets in theUnited States and on again around the globe until cause and effectare obscured.   ``As the players increase in number ... the risk of strongmovement increases.''   Tuccillo's conclusion and advice:   ``The economy in 1988, although weaker than last year, isgrowing in an atmosphere of steady (interest) rates and lowinflation. So, when rates run up, hold tight and ride out thefour-to six-week frenzy.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thursday May 26</NOTE></DOC>
