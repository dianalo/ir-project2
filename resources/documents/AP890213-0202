(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Weeks before Colombia's Nevado del Ruizvolcano erupted, melting glaciers and unleashing torrents of mudthat buried 25,000 people, geologists drafted a map showing exactlywhere the muck would flow.   The 17,700-foot volcano started spewing ash Sept. 11, 1985.Scientists gave the map to officials Oct. 7 and urged them to startemergency preparations. A newspaper published the map a couple dayslater. But survivors of the deadly Nov. 13 eruption complained theyweren't warned.   ``There were no evacuations ordered as a result of the map,''which also may not have been understood by residents who saw it,said U.S. Geological Survey volcanologist Robert Tilling. ``Thatshouldn't have happened. The whole emergency response network failedand, as a result, thousands died.''   Time and again geologists have warned of impending disasters orurged that steps be taken to reduce the death toll in futurecatastrophes. Many of these efforts have been ignored because ofpolitics, economic concerns, uncertainty in their predictions,communications failures and the very human tendency to avoidunpleasant realities.   ``Geophysicists more than once warned builders of the highseismic activity in northwest Armenia,'' the Communist Partynewspaper Pravda said after the Dec. 7 earthquake that rocked a partof Soviet Armenia known for centuries for deadly quakes. At least24,000 people died, entombed in collapsed adobe huts, stone homesand inadequately reinforced concrete-slab buildings.   ``It's not enough to assess hazards. Something has to be donewith this information,'' Geological Survey scientist C. Dan Millertold 200 officials in November when the agency held a ``Geohazards'88'' symposium in Menlo Park on how science can save lives fromquakes, volcanoes and landslides.   Earthquakes, landslides, tidal waves, hurricanes, tornadoes,floods, volcanic eruptions and wildfires killed more than 2.8million people worldwide in the past 20 years, and caused up to $100billion in property damage, said a 1987 National Research Councilreport.   ``The impacts of natural hazards are increasing and will continueto do so unless the world community takes concerted action,'' thereport said, urging a worldwide scientific effort in the 1990s toreduce the natural disaster toll.   Many nations lack the money or political and social institutionscapable of acting, said Julia Taft of the Office of U.S. ForeignDisaster Assistance. ``The greatest human burden from naturalcatastrophes falls on the poor, powerless and helpless victims inthe Third World.''</TEXT><HEAD>It's OK To Count On Your Fingers</HEAD><DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Schoolteachers have scolded children forcounting with their fingers for decades, but some researchers sayfinger-counting can keep good students good and help not-so-goodstudents become better.   Robert Siegler and Dennis Kerkman, Carnegie Mellon Universitypsychology professors, say their studies show there's nothing wrongwith finger-counting, and teachers probably should show theirstudents how to do it correctly.   ``They're going to do it anyway. Every teacher we've talked aboutthis with has told us that telling children not to use their fingersdoesn't work... We think children are right to do this because ifyou don't know the answer very well, then it's better to be rightthan to be wrong,'' Siegler said.   Good students rely on their memories more than not-so-goodstudents or perfectionists to solve mathh and reading problems,according to a study of 80 children at an elementary school insuburban Monroeville.   When they couldn't remember an answer good students turn tobackup methods, including sounding out words, using a dictionary,counting up from a number to add or down from a number to subtract _or using their fingers. Perfectionists used backup methods even whenthey could remember the answer, frequently taking longer to solveproblems as a result, Siegler and Kerkman discovered.   Not-so-good students gave the most incorrect answers, asexpected, but also displayed poor finger-counting skills. Poorstudents may do poor work because they are bad at backup strategies,including finger-counting, Siegler said.   ``It's inefficient to be wrong, because you don't learn from it.If you do a problem and generate a wrong answer in arithmetic,there's nothing much to be learned. All that can happen is thatyou're going to connect that wrong answer to a problem, and thatwill harm the process of learning the right ones.''</TEXT><HEAD>Washington's Birthday Key Ritual In American Culture</HEAD><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It may seem like just a day off, but Monday marksa key ritual for affirming the nation's identity by linking up to alegend.   With its ancestor worship and retelling of myths, Washington'sBirthday serves the cultural purpose of instructing the young andreminding grown-ups about what it is to be an American, socialscience experts say.   ``He was in a way an ideal American, and so in celebrating hisbirthday the society celebrates itself. It is important for societyto do that because in this way it reinforces its values,'' said LiahGreenfeld, an assistant professor of sociology and social studies atHarvard University.   ``American identity for the most part begins with Washington,''said David Kertzer, an anthropology professor at Bowdoin College inBrunswick, Maine. He is ``the point of reference (for) what it meansto be an American.''   Ancestor worship, is common in the world's cultures, the expertssaid.   Enshrining heroes in myths is a way ``of really providing our ownidentity by attaching ourselves to a past that is larger thanlife... To do that we have to regularly have some ritual observancesto keep those myths and those heroes alive,'' said Kertzer, authorof the recent ``Ritual, Politics and Power.''   So what does George Washington represent? There's honesty (thecherry tree confession), and strength, (flinging the silver dollaracross the Potomac). He also is portrayed as a loving and caringfather of the country.   ``People need fathers,'' said Martha Ward, professor ofanthropology and urban studies at the University of New Orleans.``This is a myth about how fathers should act.''   Valley Forge provides a classic hero myth, Ward said. ``Heroesmust go through a time of testing, in which they must triumph.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Feb. 16</NOTE></DOC>
