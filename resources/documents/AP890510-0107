May 4   The Journal-Bulletin, Providence, R.I., on Yasser Arafat:   Yasser Arafat's public relations campaign is in full swing, and(last) week he found himself in Paris, received by PresidentMitterrand of France.   This is, of course, a significant breakthrough for the head ofthe Palestine Liberation Organization: Recognition by the Frenchhead of state is exactly the sort of ammunition the PLO requires inits diplomatic campaign.   It is a step or two above the American decision _ long overdue... to talk to the principal voice of the Palestinian people. ...   Arafat did tell the French that he explicitly disavows the oldPLO charter, a provision of which calls for the destruction ofIsrael.   That is real progress. Now, if ... Arafat will take actionagainst these internecine killings, he may lend some real substanceto his diplomatic status.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 9   Daily News, Los Angeles, on Iranian ``moderates'':   When ex-National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane and OliverNorth, then a National Security Council aide, flew to Iran in May1986 to exchange military parts covertly for American hostages,more than an arms-for-hostages deal was supposedly at stake.   The other goal _ or so President Reagan later claimed _ was toincrease contacts with so-called Iranian moderates, who presumablywould improve relations with the United States and soften Iran'sbrutal government after the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.   One of the ``moderates'' who administration officials had longhoped would produce a diplomatic breakthrough was HashemiRafsanjani, speaker of the Iranian Parliament, who was endorsedSunday by departing President Ali Khamenei as his successor. ...   On Friday, the ``moderate'' Rafsanjani urged Palestinians tokill Americans and their Western allies to avenge Arabs killed inthe 17 months of rioting in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and GazaStrip. He recommended that for every Palestinian killed in theuprising, five Americans, Britons or Frenchmen be assassinated. ...   Rafsanjani has shown, unfortunately, that he's more than readyto carry on in the Khomeini tradition.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 5   The Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette on the Oliver North verdict:   The Reagan administration's place in U.S. history was furthercemented (May 4) by the conviction of Oliver North, Ronald Reagan'sidea of ``a national hero.''   The guilty verdict was more than a finding against one WhiteHouse agent on three specific violations. It will be seen aroundthe globe as a judgment against CIA-style covert wars.   When the president attempted to overthrow tiny Nicaragua, hidingthe operation from the American people, he broke the first rule ofdemocracy: that the people decide their nation's actions. Theconcealment failed, and America was dishonored in the eyes of mostof the human race. The World Court found America guilty oftreaty-breaking.   For years, the Kremlin and its KGB sponsored surrogate wars inother nations. We hope (the North) verdict helps terminateAmerica's participation in this ugly practice.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 7   The Greenwood (Miss.) Commonwealth on the Oliver North verdict:   Oliver L. North really believed in his covert mission of helpingthe Nicaraguan rebels who were struggling against the CommunistSandinista government which runs the country. We're persuaded thathe thought what he was doing was the right thing to do. ...   But he violated the law. He lied to people in authority. Hedeceived Congress. Even when persons are loyal and well-meaning,that is no excuse for deceit that violates the law.   The jury in the North trial obviously had a tough time coming toa decision. Jury members deliberated painfully over 12 days beforereaching their verdict; not guilty of nine of the charges againsthim but guilty of shredding documents, of accepting payment for the$13,800 security system installed at his home and of destroying andfalsifying records and aiding and abetting the obstruction ofCongress. As we recall, North conceded as much during the trial.   While North now faces substantial penalties _ at worst, 10 yearsin prison and fines totaling $750,000 _ we suspect his sentencewill be much lighter, and in our view it should be.   We're convinced North was not working on his won. Despite thedenials of former President Ronald Reagan and President GeorgeBush, we suspect they knew what North was doing. So did CIADirector William Casey, now dead. Certainly that mitigates North'swrongdoing.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 5   Capital Journal, Pierre, S.D., on the Oliver North verdict:   We ... believe that while an appeal from the (Oliver North)verdict might result in reversing the conviction on those threecounts, President Bush should spare the taxpayers and Lt. Col.North of any further expensive litigation by promptly issuing apardon. ...   This would not be full compensation for the indignity to whichhe and his family have been subjected during the past year, but atleast it would recognize the validity of his assertion that therewas no criminal intent on his part and that he believed the ordershe received from his superiors were lawful.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
