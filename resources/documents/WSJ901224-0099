The ministers also agreed to toughen car-pollution curbs,which now are less rigorous than those in the U.S. ECEnvironment Commissioner Carlo Ripa di Meana said the ECwould soon propose fuel-efficiency standards for cars and acommunitywide speed limit.   Italian Environment Minister Giorgio Ruffolo said thelimits would cut auto emissions of carbon monoxide by 57%.                                                                                                          SWISS AIR-SAFETY CONCERNS                                                                                                          Swiss authorities issued preliminary recommendations aimedat increasing air safety, five weeks after an Alitaliaairline smashed into a hillside, killing all 46 people onboard. In a preliminary report on the crash, the AccidentInvestigation Office said there was a need for improvementsin Swiss air-traffic-control procedures and in lighting. Italso indicated shortcomings in Alitalia landing rules. FlightAZ404 from Milan crashed into a hill at Zurich's Klotenairport Nov. 14.                                                                                                          LOANS FOR CHINA                                                                                                          Japan announced loans of up to 42.6 billion yen ($315.7million) for China, the second portion of a loan package thathad been frozen soon after the crackdown on pro-democracyprotests in Beijing last year and that resumed in November.The latest loans are for five projects to update port,highway, telecommunications, air-traffic-control and railwaysystems.                                                                                                          SOUTH KOREA LOOKS AHEAD                                                                                                          South Korea will aim for economic growth of around 7% in1991, lower than the 9% expected this year, the EconomicPlanning Board said. The targeted growth rate in real termswould be the second worst in five years; the worst was 1989's6.7% growth. Announcing the government's economic-managementplan for 1991, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Seung Yun said thenation's export-oriented economy would be hurt by suchfactors as higher oil prices and a global economic slowdownconnected with the Gulf crisis and overseas tradeprotectionism.                                                                                                          AN APPEAL FROM THE FAO                                                                                                          The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization'sdirector-general, Edouard Saouma, called for more food aid toAfrican nations threatened by famine. &quot;If the world has beencapable of breaking down the political barrier between Eastand West, it should be able to attack the economic dividebetween North and South,&quot; Mr. Saouma said in a year-endmessage on the state of world food and agriculture. Ethiopiaand Sudan need massive assistance to avoid famine in 1991,the FAO chief said.                                                                                                          JAPAN'S POPULATION GROWTH                                                                                                          Japan's population is growing at its slowest rate sinceWorld War II, a preliminary report on the 1990 census showed.The population totaled 123,611,541 on Oct. 1, up only 2.1%from 1985, the last time a census was taken. The previousrecord low growth was 3.4% in the five years from 1980 to1985. Surveys of Japanese business show almost allrespondents feel affected by the low birth rate. Those unableto fill jobs with Japanese workers are turning increasinglyto illegal-immigrant labor.                                                                                                          A VERY LARGE JET                                                                                                          Airbus Industrie is studying the possibility of a verylarge commercial jet that would allow it to attack its rivalBoeing Commercial Airplane Group in the Boeing Co. unit'smost lucrative market.   The giant aircraft envisaged by Airbus designers would becapable of carrying up to 700 passengers and would have arange of at least 7,000 miles, enabling airlines to flycomfortably nonstop from Europe to Sydney, for example.   Airbus officials say the new plane would be designed toattack Boeing head-on in the high-capacity commercial-jetmarket where it has enjoyed a monopoly up to now thanks tothe Boeing 747 jumbo jet that first entered service 20 yearsago.   Jean Pierson, Airbus Industrie's chief executive,indicated in a recent newspaper interview that if the Airbuspartners decide to go ahead with the idea, the aircraft couldenter the development stage in 1997 and enter service withairlines in 2002. Airbus Industrie's partners areAerospatiale of France; Messerschmitt-BoelkowBlohm G.m.b.H.,a unit of Daimler-Benz AG of West Germany; British AerospacePLC; and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          Irish children are fatter and less fit than theircounterparts in other parts of Europe, according to a surveyby Ireland's National Youth Council. Ten-year-old Irish boyswere shown to be 7.5 pounds heavier than their Britishequivalents and 3.5 pounds fatter than Dutch boys. . . .North Korea has notified the Soviet Union's Novosti pressagency and Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper to close theirbureaus in Pyongyang, the Yonhap News Agency of South Koreareported. The order is believed to be a sign of displeasurewith the recent visit of South Korean President Roh Tae Wooto the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
