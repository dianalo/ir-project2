A high-pressure fuel filter from the wreckage appeared to beloosely connected, as did another one found on a spare fuelassembly at a Horizon Air facility, the officials said Tuesday.   Three of the 19 people injured in Friday's accident remainedhospitalized today, one in serious but stable condition, the othersin satisfactory condition.   Horizon Air President John Kelly said it was possible that aloose fuel filter could allow vapors or fuel to collect and ignite,but whether that happened in the plane that crashed won't be knownfor certain until the investigation is complete.   ``The fuel filter was not tight,'' said Kelly. ``It was slightlybacked away, which it should not be.''   All airlines using de Havilland Dash 8 aircraft may be asked tocheck their high-pressure fuel filters, said Bob Benson, who isinvestigating the accident for the National Transportation SafetyBoard.   ``This may occur pretty shortly, but we're still in the processof checking a lot of other things,'' he said.   Horizon officials checked all of the airline's Dash 8 enginesover the weekend and did not find any other loose filters in thetwin-engine turboprops, Kelly said.   But they also found the loose fuel filter in a spare assembly``fresh from the box ... which we would not have had contactwith,'' Kelly said. The Federal Aviation Administration isinvestigating, he said.   Kelly said there was no connection between the latest enginefire and one that was reported last June.   He also said that different causes had been found for the fuelleak that caused the engine fire in June and a case of reeking fuelon April 8 in the engine that caught fire Friday. Maintenance wasperformed, and no further complaints were received after the April8 incident, Kelly said.   In June, NTSB records say there was an explosion and fire in theright engine just after takeoff from Sea-Tac. The pilot shut offthe engine, used two fire extinguishers to put out the blaze andmade an emergency landing at Boeing Field. No one was hurt.   NTSB records show a third such Dash 8 engine fire in a MetroExpress Inc. plane that tried to take off Dec. 2, 1986, in Atlanta.   In Atlanta, the Dash 8 had just taken off and had gained analtitude of 4,000 feet when there was ``a loud pop'' and smoke andfire in the right engine, NTSB records say.   The plane first lost power, then the fire started. The pilotshut down the engine, broke out fire extinguishers and was able toland. There were no injuries.</TEXT></DOC>
