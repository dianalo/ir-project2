Portraits of Che Guevara and Farabundo Marti, the revolutionistfor whom the Marxist-led guerrilla army is named, gaze from campuswalls at students moving between classes at the University of ElSalvador.   ``Long live the people up in arms!'' is written across theSchool of Humanities facade. Leftist folk songs boom over thepublic address system.   Conservative groups in El Salvador, a nation of 5.5 millionpaople about the size of Massachusetts, say the 35,000-memberstudent body has become a fifth column of subversives.   Some students, teachers and alumni contend, however, thatradical student unions do not represent the majority.   Like nearly all national universities in Latin America, ElSalvador's is financed by the state but remains autonomous. Thegovernment has virtually nothing to do with its administration.   Police and soldiers are forbidden by law from entering thegrounds, but that did not prevent a military-dominated regime frominvading the school in 1980 and shutting it down for four years.   When President Jose Napoleon Duarte, a Christian Democrat,visited the campus last year to inspect damage done by a severeearthquake, catcalls and shouted insults drowned out his attemptsto speak.   ``If we examine the institutions that identify with the needsand aspirations of the Salvadoran people, we find they are allpoliticized because we are in the middle of a war,'' said LuisArgueta Antillon, a leftist economist who is the university'srector.   ``These institutions cannot withdraw themselves from that war.No one can remain neutral,'' he told an interviewer in his office.   A conservative alumni group alleged in paid announcementspublished last month that ``the standard bearers of terrorism'' hadtaken over the student body with the object of ``fomenting socialdisorder.''   Student unions use demonstrations for increased governmentspending on education as a pretext for ``acts of terrorism'' in thestreets, the ads said.   Among about 3,000 students in a march for more funds Sept. 13were 200 with bandannas over their faces, carrying iron staves ornail-studded wooden clubs. The military says some masked marchersare guerrilla ``urban commandos.''   That march ended in a melee of tear gas and flailing clubs when300 riot troopers moved in on the demonstrators. The driver of apolice truck was killed, allegedly shot by a marcher.   About 250 people were arrested and 14 charged with subversiveaffiliation. All eventually were released for lack of evidence.   Argueta said security forces frustrated at release by the courtsof people they consider subversive might resort to kidnapping andmurder to quell student action.   Two young men carrying books entered a university cafeteria Oct.3, walked up to custodian Raul Escamilla, drew pistols and shot himto death. A university statement called the killing ``part of agovernment and military campaign against the university.''   Escamilla, 34, was arrested by the National Police and held forseveral days last year on suspicion of affiliation with theFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front.   Eli Ruiz, a journalism professor, worries about the effect ofradical activism on academic standards.   ``The effort to keep classes from politicizing is constant,''Ruiz said, and he tries to teach according to ``scientific''criteria, ``but because of the context of conflict that is verydifficult.''   The rector, Arqueta, contends ``We cannot think in terms ofacademic level for its own sake.''   He said medical school graduates had enjoyed success in NorthAmerica and Europe, a testament to their training, ``but the factwe turned out good doctors did not lower our infant mortality rateor provide better conditions of public health or increase lifeexpectancy.''   Argueta is presiding over a revision of the rules to requirethat future graduates contribute 500 hours of ``social service'' intheir fields.   Asked why no centrist or rightist student union had been formed,he noted that 75 percent of students were from families of workersor peasants while ``the expressions of the center and the right areminority expressions.''   ``Realizing they are in the minority, they don't want to getinto an open confrontation of ideas,'' he said of students from thepolitical center and right.   One student, speaking privately, said conservatives on campusare intimidated by the radical ``minority.''   ``When they come into a lecture hall and announce that class issuspended for a march or a sit-in, maybe three or four out of 80take part in the activity,'' she said.   Many conservative students express their opinions on lavatorywalls. A tour turned up condemnations of the guerrillas and leftiststudent unions, generally unprintable, and ``Vivas'' for RonaldReagan and Roberto d'Aubuisson.   D'Aubuisson leads the rightist Arena party, which won control ofthe legislature this year, and is said to have headed rightistdeath squads accused of killing thousands of alleged leftists inthe early 1980s.</TEXT></DOC>
