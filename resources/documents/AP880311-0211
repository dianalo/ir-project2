Speaking to representatives of a trade coalition gathered in theauditorium of the Old Executive Office Building, Reagan said, ``Iwould note that on Tuesday, those who had predicted thatprotectionism would be embraced in the South were proven wrong.''   Reagan was referring to election returns on Super Tuesday inwhich Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., a proponent of tough tradesanctions against other nations, managed to win only one of 20states, his homestate of Missouri.   ``Too many backers of the trade bill talk about making Americamore competitive but support provisions that would bench some ofthe best competitors on our team,'' the president said. ``They talkabout saving jobs, but they want provisions that have the potentialto destroy thousands if not millions of American jobs.''   Reagan said that any trade bill passed by Congress should notviolate accords the United States has signed in the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade.   He also said the provisions of any such legislation should not``provoke retaliation against our bombing export business,''bringing a roar of laughter from the audience. Reagan quicklycorrected himself, saying, ``wait a minute _ our booming exportbusiness.''</TEXT></DOC>
