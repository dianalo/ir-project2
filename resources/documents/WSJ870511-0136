The maker of Hush Puppies and other shoes said the plan is &quot;designed to deter coercive takeover tactics and to prevent an acquirer from gaining control of the corporation without offering a fair price to all of the corporation's stockholders.&quot; A spokeswoman said Wolverine isn't aware of any efforts to take over the company.    Under the terms of the plan, the rights will be distributed at the rate of one right for each common share held. Each right entitles holders to purchase, for $40, 1/100th of a newly issued share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. Wolverine said the rights will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of at least 20% of its common stock or begins a tender or exchange offer that would result in the person or group beneficially owning at least 30% of Wolverine's common stock. The rights expire May 8, 1997.    The company said it can redeem the rights at one cent apiece at any time until 15 days following a public announcement that a 20% stake has been acquired.    Other details of the plan will be provided by letter to holders. </TEXT></DOC>
