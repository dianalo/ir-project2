It targets fundamentalist churches, offering everythingfrom carpets to pews to insurance to mutual funds. &quot;I'm aniche marketer. Forget everything else. This is awell-defined market,&quot; says Thomas McElheny, chairman of theSarasota, Fla., company.</LP><TEXT>   Christian Purchasing's designated market -- evangelicalChristians -- is the fastest growing segment of the U.S.religious spectrum. Mr. McElheny estimates evangelicalChristians are building 2,000 new churches in the U.S. eachyear. Christian Purchasing hopes to help church leadersfinance, build and outfit these churches. Later, they hope toinsure the churches and perhaps even sell insurance andmutual funds to church members.   &quot;My stated goal is within three years, we will know moreabout marketing to the niche Christian community than anyoneelse,&quot; Mr. McElheny says. Christian Purchasing went publicearlier this year and is still in the early stages of itsmarketing effort. Its shares are currently traded at $6.75bid in over-the-counter trading.   The market has been successfully tapped in the past bysuch business-savvy religious leaders as Pat Robertson. Mr.McElheny believes there is a lesson in such success: Acompany can profit in the Christian market and still be &quot;ablessing&quot; to the community.   But some church management officials warn that selling toreligious organizations may not be easy.   &quot;People in ministry are just as finicky about where theyspend their money as any corporate executive,&quot; says CraigOstbo, director of marketing for the Christian ManagementAssociation, a resource group for churches.   A variety of purchasing sources sustain most churchestoday. Some churches do most of their buying from localsources. Others seek distant, specialized outlets for certainprojects. While church officials like the idea of a singleorganization that caters to a variety of church needs, manydoubt how well it would be received.   &quot;You risk offending a church member who may be in the samebusiness,&quot; says Mark DeMoss, a spokesman for Jerry Falwell'sThomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Va.   Christian Purchasing isn't intimidated because it isn'tcompeting now for the business of existing churches. Mr.McElheny plans to establish credibility by building andequipping new churches.   &quot;The evangelical church is a growing church so there is noestablished buying pattern,&quot; he says.   Christian Purchasing hopes relationships with state andlocal church authorities will provide entry to new-churchbusiness. Already, McElheny says, the company has $12 millionin contracts to build new churches. He expects that total togrow to about $30 million by June 30, 1992, and thenquadruple in the following year.   One reason for optimism, Mr. McElheny says, is theprospect for a mortgage pool that would allow churchconstruction financing on more favorable terms. ChristianPurchasing has held talks on such a proposal with a group ofbanks and insurance companies.   In addition to building and furnishing churches, ChristianPurchasing Network believes it may be the only companyoffering churches financial services as well. With the recentacquisition of the money management firm Equity AssetsManagement of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., the company plans tomarket the &quot;Good Shepherd&quot; family of equity mutual fundsthrough advertisements in Christian print media. It also willoffer the funds on a wholesale basis through brokers. Thestocks in the fund portfolios are a general mix of companies,and not necessarily Christian-oriented.</TEXT></DOC>
