Emphasis is on the common pneumoconioses,that is, silicosis, coalworker's pneumoconiosis, and asbestos-relatedpleural and parenchymal disease. Examples of the five radiographic formsof silicosis-simple and complicated silicosis, Caplan syndrome, silicotuberculosis,and acute silicosis- are presented, and the differential diagnoses arediscussed. Discussion of asbestos-related disease included pleural manifestationssuch as plaques, diffuse pleural thickening, and asbestos pleural effusionas well as asbestosis and malignancies associated with asbestos exposure,such as bronchogenic carcinoma and malignant mesothelioma. Although thestandard radiographic findings are stressed, the use of CT in the diagnosisof pneumoconiosis and the staging of dust-related malignancies is alsodiscussed.</TEXT></DOC>
