(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Reliability Is Key to OS/2-Based Word ProcessorsandM;According to buyers of OS/2-based word-processing software, reliability andease of use are the name of the game.andM;&quot;A word-processing package has got to be user friendly.andP;  If your users needconstant support, you're wasting time that could be better utilized,&quot; saidAshley Wright, an office automation technician at the Broward CountyCourthouse in Florida.andM;In this week's Poll of Corporate Satisfaction, about 200 corporate buyersrated three OS/2-based word-processing packages in 11 categories.andP;  Of thepackages included, WordPerfect 5.0 for OS/2 from WordPerfect Corp. of Orem,Utah, and Microsoft Word 5.0 for OS/2 from, Microsoft Corp. of Redmond,Wash., vied for the top overall score, while DisplayWrite5/2 from IBM ofArmonk, N.Y., scored consistently lower than its competitors.andM;For inclusion in this week's Poll, all of the products had to be OS/2-based,full-featured, character-based word processors written specifically for OS/2without utilizing Presentation Manager.andM;&quot;The ability and functionality of WordPerfect comes close to what you can doin [Ventura Software Inc.'s] Ventura Publisher without the overhead,&quot; saidBruce Wynn, technical consultant at Texas Instruments Inc., anelectronics/defense systems manufacturer.andP;  &quot;You can bring in all types ofgraphics, and it's a pretty easy package to get a handle on.&quot;andM;Buyers of Microsoft Word were equally pleased, said Larry Gremillion, aninformation specialist at Cajun Electric Power Corp. Inc., a generator andtransmission utility.andP;  &quot;Microsoft works well with any kind of system.andP;  It'sthe easiest word-processing package for people to learn.andP;  I've had people whohave never seen a computer sit down and learn how to create their owndocuments within a day.&quot;andM;In contrast, buyers of IBM's DisplayWrite were generally disappointed.andO;&quot;DisplayWrite's entire approach to word processing is a hindrance.andM;Ideally it should be a tool for quick transmission of thoughts and concepts,with flexible formatting and editing tools,&quot; said Ermine Todd, a PCconsultant at Alabaster System, a small-business consulting firm.andM;&quot;Unfortunately, Display Write works like an electronic typewriter.andP;  It's moreof a transcription tool than a word processor,&quot; he added.andM;WordPerfect and Microsoft Word were rated on even ground by their respectivebuyers in most of the attributes.andP;  However, WordPerfect excelled in qualityand accessibility of product support, as well as value relative to cost,while Microsoft Word received a notably high score for ease of use of userinterface.andM;&quot;Microsoft is probably the easiest package I've picked up.andP;  It's much easierthan WordPerfect,&quot; said Gremillion.andP;  &quot;The menuing system makes it incrediblysimple.andP;  With the Help command, you can run tutorials on any topic.&quot;andM;Buyers of Wordperfect found that product a bit tougher to learn.andP;  &quot;WhileWordPerfect has all the features we need, the learning curve is steeper thanthe others,&quot; said a manager of technical support at a large health-carecompany who asked to remain anonymous.andP;  &quot;It's tough for our managers to takethe time to learn how to use it.&quot;andM;According to Ken Stofflet, a microcomputer support specialist at a stateagency that oversees public utilities, DisplayWrite is not easy or intuitive.andM;&quot;[DisplayWrite] seems to require a different mindset,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Thecommands are not well-laid-out, making it difficult to learn.andP;  It's reallynot worth the effort to train our users on it.&quot;andM;Several buyers found WordPerfect's support better than that of itscompetitors due to the company's accessibility.andM;Buyers of both Microsoft Word and DisplayWrite said they had trouble gettinganswers.andM;&quot;WordPerfect has been excellent for technical issues,&quot; said Sandra Sehlhorst,an office-systems manager at ITT Automotive Inc., an automotive-partsmanufacturer.andP;  &quot;They've solved issues for us involving formatting and fileconversion.andP;  Not only are they accessible, but their etiquette is veryprofessional.&quot;andM;&quot;With Microsoft, it's the usual scenario.andP;  You spend a lot of time waiting onhold,&quot; said Cajun Electric's Gremillion.andM;&quot;[Microsoft] has the worst support in the industry.andP;  If the problem isOS/2-related, you can never get through,&quot; said James Sheehy, vice presidentof information systems at the Superior National Insurance Co.andM;A systems engineer at a state government agency who requested anonymity saidthat with IBM, the type of support you receive depends on who you are.andP;  &quot;Youhave to use the normal corporate avenues to get good support from IBM, whichmeans for small businesses, it's hard to get a response from them,&quot; he said.andM;The other area in which WordPerfect excelled, value relative to cost, seemedto be gauged by buyers in accordance with functionality.andP;  In this category,WordPerfect surpassed DisplayWrite by a full 20 points.andM;&quot;WordPerfect is a good buy because it can be converted into so many formats.andO;Of course I would like to pay less, but for its functionality, we're willingto pay the price,&quot; said ITT's Sehlhorst.andM;&quot;There's no overriding reason to look at DisplayWrite.andP;  As opposed toWordPerfect, it doesn't shine as a stand-alone or network product,&quot; said thesystems engineer.andM;&quot;DisplayWrite needs to go through a couple more releases before it cancompete with the other packages on the market,&quot; added Broward CountyCourthouse's Wright.andM;In the remaining categories, WordPerfect and Microsoft Word ran neck and neckacross the board.andM;Buyers rated each product nearly identically for overall reliability, overallperformance, text-formatting capability/flexibility of output and the twoareas of documentation.andM;According to Texas Instrument's Wynn, reliability and performance meancompatibility and integration.andP;  &quot;Integration is critical,&quot; he said,&quot;especially when you're working with diagrams to include in your document.andO;With WordPerfect, integration is no problem.&quot;andM;For Gremillion, reliability and performance mean the product's outputconsistently meets expections.andM;&quot;I want [the software] to do what I ask without destroying my data,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;Given that definition, Microsoft Word is very reliable.&quot;andM;In the text-formatting area, DisplayWrite fell 19 points behind its closestcompetitor.andM;&quot;The WYSIWYG function is lacking,&quot; said Alabaster System's Todd.andP;  &quot;Due to alack of formatting options, it's hard to envision the final output.&quot;andM;Buyers of both WordPerfect and Microsoft Word found those packages to be moreflexible.andM;&quot;With WordPerfect, text formatting is as flexible as the user wants it to be.andO;There isn't anything you can't do as far as page set-up.andP;  You can even resetmargins on the fly,&quot; said Wynn.andM;&quot;Microsoft has the ability to set up storable templates,&quot; said an associatestaff analyst at a major municipal government agency who asked to remainanonymous.andP;  &quot;If you can access that template with a single stroke.&quot;andM;While buyers seemed to agree that overall documentation could be improved,buyers of IBM's DisplayWrite said the product's documentation just doesn'tmake the grade.andM;&quot;IBM is not really good about manuals.andP;  Although the information is there,it's hard to find what you're looking for,&quot; said Prentis Waters, a PCspecialist at Greenville Hospital.andM;&quot;My users refuse to even look at DisplayWrite's documentation.andP;  It's notsomething they feel they can obtain information from quickly,&quot; added Todd.andM;Buyers of both WordPerfect and Microsoft Word also voiced minor complaints.andM;&quot;WordPerfect has a good learning workbook, but more examples would behelpful,&quot; said Charles Moses, a technical consultant at A-M InternationalInc., a small business consulting firm.andM;&quot;Microsoft's documentation is no better or worse than the others out there.andO;Since the middle '70s, documentation has been the bane of the industry,&quot; saidthe associate staff analyst.andM;* WordPerfect and Microsoft Word received relatively high overall scores fromtheir respective buyers as compared with the overall score received byDisplayWrite.andM;* WordPerfect and Microsoft Word received nearly identical high scores foroverall reliability, overall performance, text formatting,capability/flexibility of output, and both completeness/organization andclarity of documentation.andM;*WordPerfect was rated notably higher than both its competitors for qualityand accessibility of support, and for value relative to cost.andM;* Although none of these packages use Presentation Manager, Microsoft Word'suser interface bested WordPerfect by eight points for ease of use, the secondmost important attribute to buyers.andM;* DisplayWrite scored notably lower than both its competitors in almost everyattribute.andM;* Gaps of eight to 20 points separated the top-ranked products fromlow-ranked DisplayWrite.andM;Chart NotesandM;The OS/2-based word-processing software included in this week's Poll arefull-featured, character-based word processors which are written specificallyfor OS/2 but do not use Presentation Manager.andM;The software packages covered in this survey include market leaders and otherbrands selected as noteworthy by PC Week's editorial staff.andM;The above data was tabulated from the responses of 198 corporate orinstitutional buyers having one or more of the required specific packagesinstalled for at least three months.andP;  Survey data for each of the abovepackages is based on responses from a minimum of 49 buyers owning acollective total of at least 1,098 installed units of that package.andM;Mean and median installed-unit averages are given to provide readers with therelative sizes of the installed bases of each package.andP;  The mean installedbase is the total number of units installed at all sites, divided by thenumber of sites.andP;  The median installed base is computed by arranging theinstalled-base sizes for all sites in numerical order, and selecting theinstalled base of that site above and below which half of these values fell.andM;The characteristics on which these OS/2 word processors were surveyedinclude: completeness and organization of documentation; clarity ofdocumentation; ease of use of user interface; quality of on-screen helpfunctions; ease of importing/exporting files; text-formattingcapability/flexibility of output; accessibility of product support; qualityof product support; value relative to cost; overall reliability and overallperformance.andM;To produce the overall scores for these packages, PC Week first calculated anaverage score for each package for each of these characteristics.andP;  To reflectthe relative importance of each characteristic as assigned by respondents,compared to all other characteristics surveyed, PC Week calculated aweighting factor, which was then used to determine individual weighted scoresfor each characteristic of every package.andP;  A package's overall score is equalto the arithmetic average of these weighted scores.andM;The results published in PC Week's Poll of Corporate Satisfaction reflect theopinions of those buyers responding to poll surveys and may not necessarilybe applicable to larger populations of buyers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
