Among the group's leaders are Peter G. Peterson, commerce secretary in the Nixon administration, and W. Michael Blumenthal, Treasury secretary in the Carter administration.    To resolve &quot;worsening economic problems,&quot; the group calls for a bipartisan effort to cut the federal deficit at least $30 billion to $40 billion in the first year. &quot;We have no interest in fingerpointing; our mutual interest now lies in contributing to the solution,&quot; the group said.    Mr. Peterson said long-term structural changes are needed. &quot;We think we in the private sector have a responsibility to make it possible for political leaders to do the right thing,&quot; he said.    Mr. Peterson is chairman of Blackstone Group, New York, and Mr. Blumenthal is chairman of Unisys Corp., Blue Bell, Pa. </TEXT></DOC>
