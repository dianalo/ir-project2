But they say they hope at least for the resumption of prisonerexchanges.   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is sending SwedishU.N. Ambassador Jan. K. Eliasson to Baghdad and Tehran in an effortto persuade Iraq and Iran to show some flexibility.   Both sides accepted a cease-fire on Aug. 20, but peace talks thatopened five days later deadlocked almost immediately.   A 1987 Security Council resolution calls on both countries tohalt all military activities, withdraw their troops to the border,exchange about 100,000 war prisoners and talk peace.   Iraq still occupies about 260 square miles of Iranian territoryand says it will not withdraw until Iran gives up the right tosearch ships for war cargo bound for Iraq. It considers that amilitary activity.   Iran, which has not stopped any Iraqi-bound ships since thecease-fire began, says the withdrawal to the border must be the nextstep in the peace process.   U.N. officials and diplomats, speaking Wednesday on condition ofanonymity, did not foresee progress on those issues but saidprogress was possible on the exchange of sick or injured POWs andother technical measures.   Both sides have also given the United Nations ``expressions ofinterest'' in resuming the exchange of POWS, the U.N. official said.   Last year, the International Committee of the Red Cross workedout a plan to register all POWs and send home sick or injured POWsbut the arrangement broke down after just a few dozen had beenexchanged.   One of the U.N. officials also said Iran and Iraq appear ready tobegin direct contacts between military officers to discuss theirfrequent complaints about cease-fire violations.   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said hehoped for progress on substantial issues, including the impasse overthe Shatt-al-Arab waterway forming the border between Iran and Iraq,but noted ``these are matters of deeper pride.''   The waterway is Iraq's only deep-water access to the Persian Gulf.</TEXT></DOC>
