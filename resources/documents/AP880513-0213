(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republican George Bush labeled MichaelDukakis naive on defense Friday, equating him with 1972 nomineeGeorge McGovern and saying ``even Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale''supported military systems Dukakis opposes.   ``The Dukakis doctrine is the doctrine of wishful thinking. Andit is bad thinking,'' the vice president told a crowd of defenseplant workers here. ``The Soviets...respect only strength. To thinkthat they would agree to cuts in their strategic and conventionalarsenals in the face of unilateral American abandonment of majorweapons programs is the height of folly.''   Bush portrayed Dukakis, his likely Democratic opponent in thefall election, as more extreme than former President Carter and1984 Democratic nominee Walter Mondale.   ``The governor's views are naive at best and if implementedwould be dangerous to the defense of this country,'' Bush said.``It is the thinking of George McGovern, not Harry Truman. EvenJimmy Carter and Walter Mondale supported systems that GovernorDukakis opposes.''   At a rally later in Escondido, Calif., Bush said the 1988 choicewill be crystal clear.   ``It will be like the McGovern race in 1972,'' he told aRepublican rally. ``It's that clear.''   The Hughes Aircraft plant, where air traffic control systems andmilitary radars are made, was the second defense plant in as manydays for the GOP nominee-to-be. He emphasized his defense policiesanew at a San Diego air show on Friday before flying to Portland,Ore., in advance of the Tuesday primary there.   Standing in the brilliant sunshine before several thousandHughes employees, Bush tossed out almost a third of his preparedspeech to wind up with a ferverent patriotic appeal.   ``If I am elected your president...I will never ever apologizefor the United States of America. I will help keep her strong,''Bush declared. ``I will protect our vital freedoms. I will helpthose around the world who are struggling for freedom and democracy.   ``Never take for granted the blessings that we have in this, thegreatest country on the face of the earth.''   As in previous speeches, Bush criticized the Democrats foropposition to various Reagan defense programs, this time aiming theaccusation directly at the Massachusetts governor.   ``Gov. Dukakis _ and Jesse Jackson as well _ opposes virtuallyevery step we are taking to keep our defenses at the technologicaledge,'' Bush said, adding Dukakis' name to a charge he initiatedThursday. ``Dukakis opposes the MX. He opposes the Midgetman. Heopposes testing of nuclear weapons. He opposes flight-testing ofballistic missiles. He opposes testing of anti-satellite weapons.He opposes the building of a strategic defense.''   Dukakis aides were quick to respond.   ``What Bush is trying to do is use 1970s arguments to face thechallenges of the 1990s,'' said Madeleine Albright, a Dukakisforeign policy adviser.   ``It's perfectly understandable that Bush is trying to shiftattention away from Noriega,'' said Chris Edley, Dukakis' topissues adviser, in a reference to stories about Panamanian Gen.Manuel Noriega.   Bush told reporters when asked about a proposal to drop drugtrafficking charges against Noriega if he leaves Panama, ``I said Iwould not comment on it ... I'm not willing to answerhypotheticals.'' But Bush went on to say ``I want to see change. Iwant to see him brought to justice.''   Bush aides denied that the vice president was implying criticismof any deal with Noriega that would involve dropping the indictment.   McGovern proposed a 20 percent cut in defense spending when hewas the nominee in 1972. Dukakis has not proposed any suchacross-the-board cuts in defense, targeting specific programs forreduction and some for increases.   Bush also pushed another theme that he plans to use in the fallelection, linking defense spending to the jobs it creates in thiscountry.   ``Some are saying that the government should look elsewhere toserve the needs of our people,'' Bush said. ``They ignore theimportance of defense research to science and technology,manufacturing and trade...and contributing to our prosperity.''   ``Undermining America's aerospace and defense industry will comeback to haunt us _ not just in terms of our national security, butin terms of our economic security,'' he added. ``The labor force oftomorrow depends on the technology that we produce today.''</TEXT></DOC>
