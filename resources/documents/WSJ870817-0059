HELENA, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Richard Maher, the new president of Christian Brothers Winery, takes a decidedly long view of the company. &quot;When people ask us how long we've been in business, I say 1,987 years, but we've only been making wine for the last hundred or so.&quot;    In these latter days, Mr. Maher, a wisecracking, 54-year-old marketer, may be the answer to the company's prayers. His task is twofold: to win consumers back to Christian Brothers' brandy and to make its wines attractive to a new generation of oenophiles.    For a while, Christian Brothers went astray. After dominating the U.S. brandy business from the mid-1950s to the beginning of this decade, the Napa Valley vintner was eclipsed by closely held E andamp; J Gallo Winery in Modesto, Calif. At the same time, Christian Brothers' wines, aimed at an older crowd of port and sherry sippers, lost ground as consumers shifted from dessert wines to upscale table varieties. Sales fell and profit flattened.    Because the winery supports schools run by the brothers, part of a Roman Catholic teaching order founded in 1680 in France, some industry analysts suggested selling the company. In the long run, they argued, a sale might be in the schools' best interest.    But the brothers mean business. &quot;They said, 'Grab hold of the company and push it,'&quot; says 44-year-old Brother David Brennan, who was charged with restructuring the winery when he became president and chairman in 1982. Last month, Brother David, who remains chairman, handed over the top post to the Irish Catholic Mr. Maher, the first non-brother to head the company.    During his stewardship, Brother David modernized the winery and made many difficult changes in personnel along the way. His efforts are already bearing fruit. A source close to the company expects sales to rise almost 5% to $115 million this year. Profit should rise as well.    In his office overlooking the vineyards, Brother David sits next to a personal computer with color graphics, a small part of the more than $25 million in capital investments during his tenure. &quot;I can track sales up to the minute,&quot; he says. &quot;I know who's been paid, how many cases we've sold.&quot;    Brother David is credited with consolidating seven wine-making operations into two, boosting marketing expenses and replacing the in-house board with current and former chief executive officers of public companies. Equally important, he hired a 32-year-old with a degree in viticulture to succeed Brother Timothy Diener, the wine maker for half a century.    Brother David also persuaded the brothers to buy the company that had been marketing Christian Brothers' products, a concern that was 70%-owned by Canada's Seagram Co. That way, Christian Brothers could &quot;gain control over its destiny,&quot; Brother David says. He brought in Mr. Maher, who was president of Seagram's Seagram Wine Co. unit, to run the brothers' marketing operation. Shortly afterward, an ad campaign featuring several brothers talking about wine was yanked off the air. &quot;It gave me a funny feeling,&quot; says Mr. Maher. &quot;It was like using Santa Claus to sell liquor.&quot;    With the restructuring completed, Brother David turned the vineyards over to Mr. Maher. &quot;The company has to be driven from a marketing standpoint,&quot; Brother David says. &quot;He is the best.&quot;    A stream of new products, new ads and new packaging is being introduced by Mr. Maher. His main effort is a new marketing campaign for brandy, which accounts for 75% of the company's revenue and profit. The ads, courting younger drinkers, emphasize brandy as a mixer, promoting such drinks as &quot;CB stingers&quot; and &quot;the Fuzzy Brother.&quot; One ad suggests mixing orange juice and brandy; it features singer Chuck Berry dressed in an orange outfit and reads, &quot;C.B. in Orange.&quot; The company also is introducing a new product, a mixture of fruit liqueurs and brandy.    In a bid to distinguish its brands, the Christian Brothers has taken its name off its generic table wines, renaming the line &quot;Mont La Salle,&quot; and has reserved the Christian Brothers name for its top-of-the-line vintage wines, which are being pushed. As part of the effort, new labels are promoting an asset previously overlooked, the company's status as one of the largest vineyard owners in Napa, the premier name among California wines. Less than 5% of the state's wine comes from Napa, says Tom Eddy, the new wine maker that Brother David picked.    Another recent campaign has targeted the market for inexpensive wines. One ad asks consumers to &quot;Taste the Fun&quot; of Christian Brothers' line of low-alcohol wines with names like &quot;Wild Berry&quot; and &quot;La Blush.&quot; Mr. Maher calls them &quot;wine for your cheeseburgers and hot dogs.&quot; He says entry costs are prohibitive for the booming wine cooler market, estimated at about $600 million this year, though he jests that he is considering introducing a &quot;Catholic Cooler,&quot; a mix of wine, fruit juice and holy water.    While Christian Brothers retains its following among older port and sherry drinkers, that market is small. In the 1960s, about 60% of the U.S. wine market was dessert wines; now port and sherry account for less than 10%.    Mr. Maher also persuaded Brother David to make an important symbolic move. Christian Brothers was weighing selling Greystone, a 98-year-old winery that had withstood the 1906 earthquake and was ordered closed three years ago out of concern it couldn't survive another disaster. Before it closed, about 400,000 wine tasters toured Greystone each year. The brothers decided to spend nearly $3 million to bring it up to code and the winery was reopened in June. The building is depicted on new labels.    The company, which was founded in 1882 and is one of California's oldest wineries, has been run as a private, taxpaying business since 1957. Proceeds are used to support 13 schools in California, Oregon and Mexico. While only a handful of the brothers -- who take vows of chastity, poverty and obedience, but aren't monks or priests -- have worked at the company historically, a brother always headed it. Grapes are harvested by members of the United Farm Workers union, reflecting the Roman Catholic Church's backing of organized labor.    Christian Brothers had fallen on hard times indeed when Mr. Eddy joined it as wine maker three years ago. &quot;There were so many things obviously wrong (with the wine-making process), it was like trying to make bread without yeast,&quot; he says. White wines were fermenting in uninsulated tanks in the sun, and none of the red wine was aging in barrels. Christian Brothers was continuing to blend grapes from different regions and years, while other California wineries were producing vintage wine.    &quot;Consumers caught up and passed Christian Brothers,&quot; says Mr. Eddy, who now oversees production of vintage wines. Not surprisingly, Brother Raphael Willeke continues to oversee the making of altar wines, of which Christian Brothers sells about 80,000 cases a year. &quot;That's more than the total output of some wineries,&quot; Brother David notes.    Making changes wasn't easy for Mr. Eddy. His first week on the job, he tasted the company's wine and pronounced nearly two million gallons unfit to be used as planned; he had 400,000 gallons distilled into brandy and downgraded the rest. &quot;We needed to show we were serious about improving our wine,&quot; Mr. Eddy says.    Many staffers left or were asked to leave. Mr. Eddy hired a younger staff to succeed them, including a 29-year-old bottling manager and a 24-year-old wine chemist. &quot;There's no question there was a lot of hurt feelings and lot of friction,&quot; he says. He calls Brother David the &quot;saving grace&quot; of the company. &quot;He took the knife; he did the surgery,&quot; Mr. Eddy says.    Sacking employees was the toughest part of his mission, Brother David says. &quot;But we do good works and we are committed to continuing those works. We're not in this for personal profit.&quot; Like all brothers, he receives a salary of about $8,000 a year. He lives in the same quarters with 76-year-old Brother Timothy, the former wine maker who still comes to the winery each day. Brother Timothy's collection of more than 1,500 corkscrews is on display at Greystone.    The changes have been gaining notice. Christian Brothers' wines are winning medals in competition, something that rarely happened in the past. &quot;There's been a tremendous upswing in quality,&quot; says syndicated wine columnist Jerry Mead. He gives high marks to the company's Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon, and says Christian Brothers makes &quot;one of the best examples&quot; of white Zinfandel, a trendy wine currently. Nonetheless, he says the company still has to convince the public, most of which views Christian Brothers' wines as good, but not fine.    Jon Fredrikson, a wine industry analyst in San Francisco, is &quot;very optimistic&quot; about Christian Brothers' chance to succeed in the fast-growing California premium wine market, which he estimates will grow about 20% this year to about $700 million in sales.    Christian Brothers, still mainly a brandy maker, has a long way to go in competing with huge wine producers. Last year, the company ranked 17th among California's approximately 700 wineries in terms of cases of wine shipped, according to an industry consulting firm. Gallo, the leader, accounted for about 40% of the state's wine shipped. This year, California's wineries are expected to have wine sales of about $2.5 billion.    Mr. Fredrikson says it will be hard to regain ground in the brandy business, which provides the lion's share of Christian Brother's revenue and profit. &quot;They'll have a real tough job of catching up. Gallo has clout, a commanding lead and aggressive pricing.&quot; On average, Gallo's brandy costs about 10% less than Christian Brothers' does, Mr. Fredrickson says.    Gallo, which entered the brandy business with its &quot;E andamp; J&quot; brand about a decade ago, last year nabbed 47% of the $215 million market for brandy made in the U.S. Christian Brothers had about a 30% share, according to industry analysts. &quot;It's a battle of the brothers,&quot; acknowledges Mr. Maher, &quot;between the Christians and Ernest and Julio.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
