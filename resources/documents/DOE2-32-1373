The AC system was selected because AC motors, in multiple kilowattsizes, can be more practical than DC motors. A wind turbine which produceselectricity has a lower overall efficiency than a system producing mechanicalpower but offers more flexibility in adapting to varying loads and inlocating the wind turbine near the load. A permanent magnet alternatordesigned to operate with a rotor speed from 70 to 150 r/min was firstoperated in the laboratory. The frequency of the output varied from 30to 65Hz, while the voltage changed from 85 to 218 V, resulting in voltageto frequency ratios (V/f) from 2.6 to 3.3 with various loads. The alternator,with a maximum rated output of 9kW, provided power to resistive loador induction motor loads. The tests revealed that standard three-phase,240 V, 60 Hz, AC induction motors will operate with any input of 85 Vand 30 Hz. A motor temperature rise of 40{sup 0}C above ambient was notexceeded when power was supplied by the alternator to a 7.6 kW motor.System efficiencies were nearly equivalent to those obtained with utilitypower, even though the V/f was below that calculated from the motor'snameplate. The wind energy conversion system (WECS) was then operatedin windspeeds of 3.5 m/s or greater. The WECS was capable of providingpower to satisfactorily operate induction motors in an autonomous system.</TEXT></DOC>
