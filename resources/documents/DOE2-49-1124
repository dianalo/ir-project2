<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-49-1124 </DOCNO><TEXT>The planktonic foraminiferal composition of deep-sea sediments is primarilycontrolled by environmental processes and diagenetic processes. Thus,in principle, it should be possible to predict the species compositionat a given site with sufficient knowledge of the preservational stateof a sample and the above-site surface-water environment. This simplemodel is tested in the northern Indian Ocean using 4 oceanographic variableswhich characterize the surface-water environment, a preservation index(PI), and foraminiferal relative abundance data from 146 surface sedimentsamples. Specifically, 2 models are tested using a systematic strategyof data analysis and multiple regression methods. The first model wastested on a data set of well-preserved samples with varying surface-waterenvironment. Bivariate plots of species abundances versus oceanographicvariables show systematic responses to more than one variable. Thus,equations were developed to predict species abundances using oceanographicvariables. Salinity is an important predictor variable in the regressionmodels for these species. A second model was tested on a data set withvarying surface-water environment and preservation. Second-order polynomialregression models incorporating the PI and the oceanographic variablessuccessfully explain observed species variation. Models excluding thePI or the oceanographic variables suffer from considerable lack of fitwhen applied to these data.</TEXT></DOC>
