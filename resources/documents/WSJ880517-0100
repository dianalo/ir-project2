The development ultimately could be a boon to the high-risk, high-yield bond market -- currently valued at about $150 billion -- by lowering financing costs for borrowers and adding more capital to the pool of junk issues. But some are skeptical about the new technique of rating junk-backed bonds and say credit rating concerns' criteria may prove too onerous.    Yesterday, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it will rate bond issues supported by cash flows from junk bonds. The move is seen by some observers as improving investors' reception for such issues. Last year, Sandamp;P and Moody's Investors Service Inc. had developed different criteria for rating investment-grade issues backed by junk bonds.    But those ratings were tied to the market value of the bonds instead of their cash flow, or the income generated from them. Many issuers and investors reacted skittishly to the three bond offerings resulting from that approach. Market value fluctuates unpredictably, while cash flow is related to the original issuers' fundamental ability to make interest payments.    The new technique is similar to that used for rating collateralized mortgage obligations, though it is more complicated because junk bonds lack much of homogeneity of the housing loan market. Moody's is right behind Sandamp;P with a similar approach.    Now, Drexel, the leading underwriter and trader of junk bonds, says the Sandamp;P rating change will enable it to sell a new investment-grade issue of bonds backed by such debt within the next two weeks. &quot;This should increase the number of people buying high-yield bonds, as well as increasing liquidity in the market,&quot; says James D'Aquila, a Drexel vice president.    Collateralized securities, issued primarily by financial institutions, are backed by a pool of assets whose cash flow covers the interest and principal payments due on the securities. Investors rely on the collateral, not the issuer's credit, for assurance of repayment. The bulk of collateralized securities are backed by mortgages, typically those guaranteed by federally sponsored housing agencies, but issuers increasingly are using new types of assets such as car loans and credit card receivables.    Junk bonds represent a huge new pool of potential collateral for investment-grade offerings, which is what prompted investment bankers and borrowers to enlist the help of rating concerns. &quot;In the long run, cash-flow transactions backed by&quot; junk bonds &quot;could lower the cost&quot; for junk issuers &quot;because it will bring more capital to the market,&quot; says Robert Grossman, an Sandamp;P vice president.    &quot;There is a potential for big arbitrage business,&quot; says Douglas Watson, a vice president at Moody's, which is &quot;very close to rating&quot; issues backed by cash flows from junk bonds. Thrifts, savings and loans and other institutions that invest in the junk-bond market can use the technique to sell off some of their junk-bond holdings and raise money for other investments. &quot;Over the next year, we'll see a lot of issuers,&quot; he says.    The reasoning behind such predictions is that junk-bond yields run two to five percentage points above those on triple-A-rated securities. Thus an issuer repackaging its junk bonds into an investment-grade offering could take advantage, or arbitrage, the difference in interest income by using the high-yield debt to back the lower-yielding debt.    For instance, a $100 million junk-bond portfolio with an average yield of 14% annually could be used to issue $70 million of single-A-rated bonds paying 10% a year, says Sandamp;P's Mr. Grossman. &quot;Assuming there are no defaults on the $100 million portfolio,&quot; the issuer would have an annual return of 23%, based on $7 million of annual interest and the $30 million of bonds used to collateralize the investment-grade offering.    Gary A. Palmer, head of capital markets at Imperial Savings Association of San Diego, a thrift unit of Imperial Savings Corp., said the rating concerns are imposing &quot;much too conservative assumptions&quot; on the junk market, limiting the appeal of collateralized offerings. &quot;I'm not sure how much arbitrage is left once the rating agencies get done,&quot; he says. &quot;In any case, investors will require higher-than-normal yields on highly rated bonds, simply because they're backed by junk.&quot;    Jonathan Kolatch, a vice president and high-yield specialist at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., agreed in part. &quot;There are a lot of different problems&quot; with junk-backed investment-grade bonds, he said. Nevertheless, he added that Goldman may underwrite its first offering before Drexel. &quot;We're evaluating all our opportunities,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
