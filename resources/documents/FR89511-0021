In the discussion of comments, four respondents,all FmHA employees, suggested amendments to allow a decision maker to appeala hearing officer's decision to overrule a denial of assistance. The Agencyrecognizes that a hearing officer may issue a decision based on a misinterpretationor error of law or regulations. In these circumstances, a procedure isneeded to review such a decision and revise or rescind it, if implementationof the decision would result in unauthorized assistance. The Agency doesnot see this as a commonplace occurrence and wishes to restrict this avenueof review to only those cases where it can be clearly shown a misinterpretationof law or regulation has taken place; not cases where a decision makeris merely dissatisfied with a particular ruling. Accordingly, we are limitingthis review to requests initiated by the State Director or appropriateAssistant Administrator.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1900</ITAG>Appeals, Credit, Loan programs-housing and community development.Therefore, as proposed, Part 1900, Chapter XVIII, Title 7, Code of FederalRegulations is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1900_GENERAL</ITAG>1.
