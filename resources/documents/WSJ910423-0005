The five-year study commissioned by the American LawInstitute, an organization that often guides courts andlegislatures on legal questions, concludes that the currentliability system penalizes corporations unfairly bypermitting inconsistent and sometimes excessive damage awardsfor noneconomic losses.</LP><TEXT>   The study recommends a package of changes, includinglimiting awards of pain and suffering to cases involving onlythe most serious injuries, cutting back on punitive damagesand establishing no-fault systems for medical malpractice andmass-disaster cases that would provide limited but guaranteedbenefits.   But the report also notes that the court system can beinhospitable to plaintiffs with legitimate claims. It seeksto address that problem by making it easier for plaintiffs torecover in environmental cases and by giving greaterauthority to judges to permit class-action suits under whicha large number of similarly situated plaintiffs can joinforces.   While many other organizations have proposed so-calledtort reform plans to alter the liability system, the programrecommended in the American Law Institute report appears tobe the most comprehensive and to be backed by the mostextensive academic research.   The institute as a whole has yet to vote on whether toadopt the report, which was released yesterday. But GeoffreyC. Hazard Jr., a Yale Law School professor and theinstitute's director, said that the institute may considerproposing model rules based on the recommendations andexpects to sponsor symposiums on many of the ideas.   The report could provide a roadmap for legislatures tryingto write new rules governing the civil justice system andcould also provide judges with guidelines in reviewing juryawards. &quot;It immediately puts {tort reform} on the agenda andis something law schools will discuss and courts andlegislative bodies will pick up on,&quot; said Mark Yudof, dean ofthe University of Texas Law School.   Paul Weiler, a Harvard Law School professor who was thestudy's chief reporter, said the proposal on compensation forpain and suffering appears to be the most controversial. Thestudy notes that pain-and-suffering awards now comprisenearly half of the total damages paid in medical andproduct-liability cases. While the group opposes placingabsolute limits on such recovery, it argues that noneconomicdamages should be paid only to the victims of permanentlydisabling injuries.   Further, the report suggests establishing a scale forpain-and-suffering damages linked to the nature andseriousness of the particular injury. This scale, adjustedfor inflation, could be used by judges and juries to makeverdicts more predictable and uniform.   To compensate for the loss of huge noneconomic damages,the report suggests that the defendant in a damage case paythe successful plaintiff's reasonable legal fees. After muchdebate, the group declined to take the next step and advocatethat plaintiffs or their lawyers bear the legal costs of asuccessful defendant. Mr. Weiler said the group feared thatsuch a further change might limit plaintiffs' access to thelegal system by making it too financially risky to file suit.   Kenneth S. Abraham, a University of Virginia School of Lawprofessor who was an associate reporter for the study, saidthe notion of shifting legal costs from one party to theother worries plaintiffs' lawyers, even though they wouldn'tbe harmed by the particular shift recommended in the report.&quot;They view it as the camel's nose under the tent and thefirst step toward tinkering with their legal fees,&quot; said Mr.Abraham. A spokeswoman for the Association of Trial Lawyersof America, a national plaintiffs' lawyer group, said thegroup had not seen the report and couldn't comment.   But Paul Rheingold, a New York plaintiffs' lawyer whoadvised the committee, said requiring defendants to payplaintiffs' lawyers fees &quot;opens a wedge to taking away theplaintiffs' lawyers right to contract with a plaintiff andmay take away the incentive to take the case to begin with ifthe fee is controlled in any way by the defendant.&quot;   The institute's proposal on punitive damages also islikely to disturb the plaintiffs' bar. Under the proposal,such damages -- designed to punish a defendant rather thancompensate a plaintiff -- would be limited to cases in whichthe defendant recklessly disregarded a plaintiff's safety.Currently, they are more widely available.   Plaintiffs' concerns are reflected in the report'sconclusion that many people suffer serious injuries withoutgetting the compensation they deserve. This happens a gooddeal in the environmental area, the report says, becauseplaintiffs have difficulty proving they were exposed to toxicsubstances and that such exposure caused their injuries.   Under the proposed system, juries would be permitted toaward damages based on the mere probability that theplaintiff's disease was caused by exposure to toxicsubstances. In cases in which a person was exposed to a toxicsubstance but showed no symptoms of disease, the reportsuggests that judges allow suits seeking payment for medicalmonitoring of the plaintiffs' health.   The American Law Institute, which spent $1 million on theliability-reform project, began work on its study in 1986 inresponse to widespread concerns that runaway jury verdictswere pushing up insurance rates and making American businessless competitive with those in other nations.</TEXT></DOC>
