 Estimates of the value ofthe PC market in Europe after the creation of the Single European Market in1992 currently stand at about double that.andP;  Some 12 billion pound sterling inPC sales is being dangled in front of manufacturers and distributors, who arebeginning to realize that unless they take the idea of the single marketseriously, they're going to be left in the cold.andM;The reason for this isn't entirely due to the bureaucrats in Brussels, busilyrunning up their seemingly unstoppable torrent of EC directives.andM;No, the reason 1992 has to be taken seriously by the PC world is because --for the computer industry at least -- it's not setting up a new idea butfollowing in the wake of existing industry trends.andM;Standardization has been the hallmark of the computer industry for manyyears, but standards bodies tend to move slowly and standards are often setin ad hoc ways by the companies that wield market clout.andP;  Nevertheless,everyone in the business knows about two things: standardization and opensystems.andM;The idea of standardization is precisely what lies behind the creation of thesingle market -- standardization on a grand scale.andP;  In some way it's amazingthe idea ever got off the ground.andP;  Standardizing -- or, in Eurospeak,harmonizing -- taxes, company law, company finance, currencies, employmentregulations and much more across the EC's 12 countries is not an enterpriseto be taken lightly.andP;  But that's what the torrent of EC directives and theGovernment advertising is all in aid of.andM;So why has this huge enterprise got underway?andP;  The answer lies in somethingthe IT industry knows about: economies of scale.andM;There are 323 million people living in the 12 EC countries.andP;  That's a bigmarket.andP;  But at the moment, it costs a lot of money to sell things acrossnational boundaries.andP;  The latest estimate is that 7.5 billion pound sterlinga year is spent on transferring goods across frontiers.andM;On average, a medium-sized company can spend five per cent of its totalturnover simply shifting things around Europe, held up by endlessform-filling, customs restrictions and national permit quotas.andP;  Small firmsend up paying out even more on red tape -- if they bother.andP;  A lot simply stayput in their own national market, reducing opportunities to expand.andM;Moreover, it also costs countries money to administer customs barriers andcheckpoints.andP;  Money that the pro-marketeers argue could be put to betteruses, like boosting national spending.andM;At the moment there are three checks to the free movement of goods andservices around the EC, which will have to go if the Single European Marketis to succeed.andP;  They are the physical barriers, and the financial andtechnical difference in goods and services between EC countries.andM;The real core of the single market lies in financial harmonization.andP;  Unlesstax differences are sorted out, then abolishing customs barriers will simplydistort trade as everyone rushes around Europe to get to the country with thelowest taxes.andM;Instead of that, the idea is to work towards a situation in which taxes areset at similar levels throughout different EC states.andP;  The aim in the EC isto bring differences down to only five per cent.andP;  Naturally, this is a thornypolitical question.andP;  The idea of trying to increase taxes in some countries-- or decrease them, and reduce valuable state income in others -- is enoughto give the most hardened marketeer sleepless nights.andM;Other ideas associated with a single market, such as a single Europeancurrency and a combined fiscal policy, have made little headway with some ECmembers -- notably the UK.andM;Even backers of the single market realize there may be difficulties ingetting the EC's 323 million inhabitants to give up their transactions inpounds, francs or deutschmarks in favour of using the ECU.andP;  Nor has anycompany yet produced its results in ECUs -- no matter how pan-European someof them claim to be.andM;But while the politicians argue over the thorny issues, there have been movesin other directions.andP;  For instance, although full abolition of customs checkswill have to wait until a Europe-wide agreement on standardized VAT rates,attempts are being made to cut down on costly and bureacratic customs checkswith the introduction of the Single Administrative Document, designed to savesheaves of paperwork.andM;The idea is to cut down on customs checks and gradually let market forcesbring prices into line in different countries.andP;  One consequence is that itshould be easier to transport equipment around Europe.andM;This will help PC manufacturers and distributors.andP;  But they're alsointerested in the third form of standardization -- of goods and services.andO;The whole aim of the single market is that by 1992 any company selling aproduct or service in one EC country will be able to sell it in every otherEC country.andM;The main impact of this comes out of the effect of 1992 on the overallmarketplace.andP;  As large companies in every business sector begin to realizethe possibilities of cross-Europe trade, the one thing they're going to needa lot more of is information.andM;Enter the IT industry, ready to cash in, it's hoped, on all kinds of needs.andO;Business executives need to find out how the EC laws will affect business inthe run-up to 1992.andP;  They need to know a lot more about their competitors inother European countries as they begin to move into new areas.andM;There's also an increasing emphasis on electronic communications.andP;  Electronicdata interchange--paperless trading--is beginning to make an impact oncompany-to-company transactions and this is likely to increase when companiesare communicating between Naples and Walsall rather than just Manchester andLiverpool.andM;Some firms have also spotted opportunities in niche markets.andP;  One Irish-basedsoftware firm is marketing a package designed to make it easier to calculatereturns from companies with subsidiaries in EC countries.andP;  A UK firm has comeup with a package designed to make it easier for exporters to find their wayaround changing customs regulations.andM;A recent report carried out by Romtec for the National Economic DevelopmentCouncil (NEDC) bears this out.andP;  The report, Selling IT in Europe: the effectsof 1992, says the main effect of the Single European Market on hardware,software and service providers will come indirectly through its effects ontheir customers.andP;  It points out something which manufacturers such as Amstradhave already taken into account -- language differences aren't going todisappear after 1992.andM;The report says: &quot;Language is the biggest single variant in terms offundamental design on hardware.andP;  Differing character sets are needed for mostEuropean countries and that means different keyboards and printers.andP;  Thisprevents complete systems from being shipped unmodified from one country toanother and is a barrier that will not be overcome by 1992 legislation.&quot;andM;So manuals will still have to be written in local languages and systems can'tbe shipped out to any part of Europe without modification.andP;  But gains can bemade, according to Amstrad, in design and chip technology, with theharmonization of things like safety and radiation standards, and modems.andM;The NEDC report says: &quot;Hardware design is largely independent of nationaldifferences already except in some minor aspects such as mains voltage,frequency and quality.andP;  Harmonization of legislation such as safety standardsbetween countries will help alleviate minor technical irritations inexporting from one country to another.&quot;andM;But it also points out that the main effects on hardware after 1992 will comefrom &quot;the standards on open systems and telecommunications which are anatural development within IT but are also part of the 1992 legislation&quot;.andM;PC manufacturers have already realized that in the race to 1992, those whoact first are likely to win most.andP;  IBM, unsurprisingly, is in a very goodposition.andP;  It already has a structure that straddles Europe, with Europe-widepolicies, but employing local people in subsidiaries throughout the EC.andM;Amstrad, too, has been steadily moving towards a greater European presence.andO;The company says its PC sales in the rest of Europe outside the UK hasalready overtaken its UK turnover.andP;  Last year Amstrad opened offices inGermany, Holland and Belgium.andP;  The year before it opened offices in Spain andItaly.andP;  Amstrad's approach to European sales is also changing, frompreviously selling through local distributors to direct sales.andM;This highlights an important aspect of 1992 covered in the NEDC report.andP;  TheSingle European Market is going to have a big effect on PC distributors.andO;According to the report, increased standardization and greater opportunityfor customers to bargain over prices, mean there will be a &quot;dramaticrestructuring&quot; of IT distribution channels.andM;However, it says that distribution channels are currently fragmented.andP;  &quot;Inthe four major countries in Europe, for example, there are 9,000 personalcomputer dealers in total, with no dominant, or even major, pan-Europeancompany.&quot;andM;As with the PC manufacturers, the distribution companies best-placed tobenefit from 1992 are those with structures already in place.andP;  While existingdistributors in Europe will have to contemplate mergers and joint ventures,US company Computerland already has a European structure in place.andM;Computerland has also announced a 12 million pound sterling investment in itsEuropean operations, setting up 34 new business centres to bring it up to atotal of 140 across Europe.andP;  In addition, the company is building 17 newEuropean warehouses.andM;The NEDC report says that distribution companies which manage to set up largeEurope-wide operations will benefit from economies of scale, getting betterterms from vendors, gaining optimum ordering, stock management and delivery,and leading development of specialist products.andM;But unless UK distributors act soon, they could end up missing out.andP;  Thereport points out that although UK distributors say they will try toestablish a stronger foothold in Europe, 72 per cent of them have so far donenothing about it.andM;In a survey of 250 top UK dealers last year, 84 percent predicted a spate ofcompany takeovers as firms attempt to get into European markets.andP;  But only 28per cent had actually drawn up any form of plan for tackling the Europeanmarket themselves.andM;This could turn out to be very short-sighted.andP;  After all, Alan Sugar didn'tget where he is today by missing out on a marketing opportunity, neither didIBM.andP;  As large companies seek to take advantage of the Single European Marketby standardizing purchasing, IT companies will need to be in a position totake advantage.andM;There will inevitably be more emphasis on marketing to cope with both largecompanies which wish to centralize purchasing, and small local opportunities.andO;The report points out that there are different marketing methods in favour indifferent European countries.andP;  It appears that the Spaniards are fonder thanthe French of catalogues and direct response advertising.andM;Here, the question of language once again raises its head.andP;  Localnegotiations in countries will require language skills which might beanswered by joint ventures rather than trying to teach a UK sales forceGerman or Italian.andP;  According to the report, British resistance to languagesis notorious and doesn't seem to be improving.andP;  Although UK companies areprepared to negotiate abroad, the UK is among the five countries leastprepared to negotiate in a foreign language.andM;Some companies are acting on this front.andP;  For some time, ICL has had aspecial committee dedicated to considering the impact of 1992 on themanufacturer's business.andP;  One of ICL's main aims is to recruit more graduatesfrom continental Europe to the company.andM;ICL may also be overtaken by pan-European forces.andP;  Its name has been linkedfor some time now with virtually every other national computer manufactureron the continent--Olivetti and Siemens, to name but two -- in persistentrumours of either acquisition or joint venture.andP;  The company's parent STC hasacknowledged that joint ventures are in line for ICL, but details have notyet emerged.andM;Another aspect of Europe after 1992 is the servicing of computer equipment.andO;Although purchasing in large pan-European firms may be centralized, usersneed to know that they will be backed up swiftly when things go wrong withtheir systems.andM;One interesting result might be that eventually service companies (which,like distributors, may end up agreeing joint ventures with counterparts indifferent countries) will have to organize themselves in a completelyEuropean-wide manner.andP;  So a French customer in Alsace may get speedierservice from a German PC maintenance company than from a Parisian firm.andP;  Ofcourse, many UK firms take the whole idea of 1992 with a large pinch of salt.andO;Those established in niche markets may have cause to do so -- but there won'tbe a lot of room for complacency.andM;The report says the alternative to forming large European distributioncompanies will be specialization in niche markets, where service, rather thanprice, is the key.andP;  But it warns that many dealers will have to overhaulexisting agreements giving distribution rights in individual countries.andP;  Inother areas affecting the PC arena -- particularly that of standards -- the1992 legislation is actually lagging behind existing industry trends.andM;For instance, the computer industry has long been moving towards recognizingthe importance of proprietary systems.andP;  European rules are now catching upwith that idea.andP;  EC member countries have already acknowledged Open SystemsInterconnection as a basis.andP;  All public sector procurements for IT systemsworth more than 60,000 must now specify OSI.andM;That move -- introduced last year -- hasn't been universally popular withusers.andP;  But most recognize that OSI is the direction in which standards areheading and most manufacturers have fallen in line with the guidelines toensure their systems comply with OSI.andM;The other main standards issue revolves around Unix.andP;  The idea of moving awayfrom proprietary operating systems and into a standard operating system --even though there are as many flavours and brands of Unix as breakfastcereals down at your local Sainsbury's -- has also been on the cards for awhile now.andM;What this means for users is a greater freedom of choice.andP;  With Unix and OSIas a basis, it will be much easier to change hardware platforms withoutrewriting software applications.andM;With competition increasing in a more open market, customers should be in agood position to haggle over prices and services.andP;  They will be specifyingnew systems, or enhancing old ones as the implications of the single marketon their businesses become clear.andP;  But they should feel reassured thatthey're going to be in a reasonable bargaining position, rather than lettingsuppliers dictate terms to them.andM;One interesting side-effect of the Single Market, as tax differences acrossEurope become evened out in the long term, is that well-known tax havens arelikely to become even more popular, as companies and wealthy individuals lookfor the perfect resting place for their nest-eggs.andM;Conversely, the benefits of registering a company in the Netherlands orLuxembourg, which gives certain tax advantages at the moment, could welldisappear in the future.andP;  One certain side-effect of 1992 is to giveaccountants a very nice line in long-term work.andM;If the predictions are correct, there will be lots of winners in 1992.andO;Customers will be better placed to demand terms from their suppliers, whiledistributors and manufacturers should benefit from increased demand.andP;  Butunless some of the existing national companies in Europe look around at theircounterparts across the national borders, the real winners in the Europeanmarket could end up being the US and Japanese multi-nationals.andM;It's a familiar scenario, but it depends on how swiftly the UK IT industryacts.andP;  After all, although 1992 doesn't seem that far away, the legislativechanges don't come in until the end of that year.andP;  So there's more than threeyears for the UK's PC market to think about the possibilities beyond theChannel.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
