In the second semifinal, Jan Timman of the Netherlands andBritish Grandmaster Jon Speelman drew a wild 47-move game in thethird round of the World Chess Championship Candidates' semifinalto leave Timman leading by two points to one.   Karpov and Yusupov were tied 1-1 after two games, but chessanalysts said they expected Yusupov to resign before play resumesin the adjourned position on Friday. A victory would move Karpovinto a 2-1 lead in the eight-game contest.   Tension rose during the sixth and final hour of play at theSadler's Wells ballet theater as Yusupov, playing white, seemed tobe closing in on a brilliant giant-killing victory over Karpov, whoheld the world title for 10 years from 1975 until 1985.   But with both players short of time, Yusupov's nerve appeared tosnap and on the 59th move he dramatically threw away a bishop.   When play adjourned two moves later, Mihai Suba, a Romaniangrandmaster who defected to Britain last year said Karpov had ``100percent winning chances.''   The winner of the Candidates's cycle will challenge worldchampion Garri Kasparov for his title in a 24-game match beginningOctober 1990. The winners of the semifinals will face off in theCandidates' final in London next March.   A win scores one point and a draw a half.   Playing white, Yusupov gave up a rook for a bishop and two pawnson the 16th move to open up the defenses around Karpov's king.   But from moves 20 to 30 Karpov unraveled his position and gaineda big advantage when he entrenched a knight in the center.   At move 34, Kasparov telephoned the championship press room fromFrance to check on developments and pronounced Karpov's position aswinning.   But Karpov allowed Yusupov to exchange queens and relieve thepressure. And in the fifth hour of play, Yusupov won a third pawnand began to throw two passed pawns up the board.   As the pawns continued their relentless advance, grandmastershuddled around video monitors and predicted a Yusupov victory.   With his back to the wall, Karpov produced a tricky 52nd movedefense, activating the rook that eventually seized white's bishop.   ``After he screwed up, Karpov defended very well,'' said BritishGrandamster Nigel Short, the third-ranked player in the world.   The Timman-Speelman encounter was a hard-fought battle riddledwith tactical tricks.   Experts said Speelman, playing black had gained an advantage inthe early middlegame, but missed his way in the complications andled Timman gain a dangerous initiative.   The Dutch grandmaster sacrificed a knight to rip open Speelman'sking's defenses, but the Englishman beat back the attack to hold adraw.   The fourth round will be played Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
