It said the railways should remain state monopolies but thatprivate firms must be able to use them to ship goods in competitionwith the rail companies.   Currently, only the EC railway companies can handle goodsshipped by rail.   ``Roads, waterways and airspace are considered public andaccessible to all, but this principle of free access has not beenapplied to the railways,'' EC Transport Commissioner Karel VanMiert said in a statement.   He said the rail companies must remain responsible formaintaining and upgrading the rail networks.   But their service activities must become separate branches tocompete with private enterprise, he added.   Over the last decade intra-EC traffic by road, air and railincreased by 400 percent, according to EC figures.   Although EC road and airways are increasingly congested, VanMiert said transport by rail remains underused despite itspotential for growth.   To reverse that, he said the EC states must improve railinfrastructure between member states and to ensure a smoothertransit of goods from one EC state to another.   ``The open market of 1992 opens promising perspective forrailroads in the trade bloc,'' Van Miert said.   On Tuesday, transport ministers of six EC states which areconsidering a high-speed passenger train network, asked for ECfunds.   Van Miert said such networks ``were subject to specialattention'' but did not indicate if any EC funds would be earmarkedfor that purpose.</TEXT></DOC>
