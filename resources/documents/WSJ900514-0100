It began with Walter Berry. He was drinking coffee at thecounter of Margie's Restaurant -- formerly a hot-dog jointcalled the Dog House -- when a director walked up and askedhim to be in a movie being filmed nearby. &quot;I thought someonewas playing a joke on me,&quot; says the 53-year-old machineoperator.</LP><TEXT>   Then his kid sister, Ludwina Scott, a 52-year-oldhomemaker who envied Shirley Temple's ringlets as a child,auditioned and won a role. Not to be outdone, the patriarchof the family, 77-year-old onetime coal miner Charles L.Berry, joined the cast.   The Berrys, it seems, are natural zombies, a sort of BradyBunch of horror films. They will make their acting debut inthe remake of George Romero's 1969 classic horror film,&quot;Night of the Living Dead,&quot; slated for a Halloween release byColumbia Pictures.   &quot;I kind of wonder what I got myself into,&quot; says an abashedWalter Berry. Ludwina says her brother doesn't realize howperfect he is for the role. She recounts how Walter oncedressed as a musician for a Halloween party at the AmericanLegion hall. But, as he is tall and skinny, with clear blueeyes and sunken cheeks, judges unwittingly voted him bestvampire. &quot;And he didn't even have any makeup on,&quot; she says.   Hospital orderlies, waitresses and meatpackers from thisrural area of western Pennsylvania competed for about 150extra slots, including roles as vigilantes and policeofficers. But most dreamed of a shot at zombiedom. &quot;Everyonewants to be a zombie,&quot; says Staci Blagovich, casting directorfor extras.   When a local newspaper ran a story announcing auditions,hundreds of people from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginiacalled asking for directions. Fearing an invasion of zombiezealots, Ms. Blagovich quietly canceled and rescheduled theaudition, moving it from a small church to a fire station,because the church didn't have a parking lot.   Other would-be stars wrote to explain why they should bezombies. One played the demon in the upcoming &quot;Exorcist 90&quot;who helps pull George C. Scott down to hell. Another saidshe, her boyfriend, her neighbor and her neighbor's boyfriendare &quot;total fans&quot; of monster movies and that this one isparticularly &quot;awesome.&quot; She included a picture of herselfwith her tongue sticking out and her arms extended as proofof her potential.   Still another wrote that her husband would be good for thepart because he acts silly with the couple's Chihuahuas. &quot;Hewalks towards them and puts his hands spooky-like above hishead and my little dogs go crazy,&quot; she wrote.   David Kuehls understands the zombie allure. A writer forBritain's Fear magazine, he played a zombie in a low-budgetmovie filmed in Akron, Ohio, called &quot;The Dead Next Door.&quot; Heand about 20 other zombies, their faces splattered with fakeblood and caked with gooey stuff, surrounded a human being,raised their hands in the air and collectively moaned. &quot;It'sfun to walk around and be a monster,&quot; he says.   Here in Pennsylvania, people have a special kinship tozombies. Twenty years ago and about a half-hour's drivenorth, Mr. Romero filmed the original &quot;Night of the LivingDead.&quot; It became a cult classic and put the little town ofEvans City on the map. Locals still talk about huddling aschildren outside the cemetery where part of the movie wasfilmed and telling ghost stories.   Mr. Romero, who wrote a revised script and is acting asexecutive director, decided on a remake for one reason:money.   Apparently, some copies of the first film wereinadvertently distributed without a copyright, which meantvirtually anyone could use the film without paying the moviemakers. As a result, original investors, who pooled theirmeager funds to make the $114,000 cult classic, reaped lessthan $1 million, even though the movie was translated into 17languages and launched Mr. Romero's career as a horror-filmguru.   The $4.2 million color remake, he hopes, will make enoughmoney to give original backers and copyright owners -- aunts,grandmothers and uncles -- a reasonable return on theirinitial investment. &quot;From my standpoint, this is purelyfinancial,&quot; says Mr. Romero.   Still, horror-film fanatics can't wait to sink their fangsinto the new &quot;Night of the Living Dead,&quot; says AnthonyTimpone, editor of Fangoria magazine. They want to see if 20years of technology, special effects and a bigger budget canimprove upon the original.   For one thing, the zombies will be a little classier. Theoriginal zombies were relatives and friends of the moviemakers -- at times, even the movie makers themselves. Theywalked mechanically and stared straight ahead. Today'szombies are sophisticated and take their shot at immortalityseriously.   They attended two sessions to learn how to stumble, falland think like a zombie. This left Edward Evans, who hasn'texercised since 1943 when he was discharged from the army,sore for weeks. Bob Kowalski, a self-ascribed entertainer whoperforms magic shows and plays bass guitar for local bands,does 50-yard zombie sprints with his arms flapping slowly,like an arthritic bird. Brenda Byers studied the originalmovie three times before her audition and has adopted ashuffling feet approach. &quot;It helps to empty your mind,&quot; sheexplains.   The elder Mr. Berry, who is missing a few teeth, says hedoesn't have any problems with the role, even though he hasnever seen a zombie or the original movie or studied methodacting. He can roll his eyes backward and drop his jaw. Andhe is remarkably spry for a 77 year old. &quot;They used to callme rubber legs on the dance floor,&quot; he says proudly. &quot;I guesseven zombies got to have a certain flair.&quot;   It also helps to be a martial-arts instructor. JohnHamilton is kicked, thrown across the kitchen floor andwhacked in the face with a rubber frying pan before gettingnailed in the head with the crowbar. He credits hisshowmanship to touring with the Master's World of Karate andKung Fu show.   But if being a zombie is difficult, being eaten alive isno picnic either. Actress Pat Tallman, who stars as theheroine, had nightmares after reading the script, especiallythe part where a drooling, one-eyed zombie with a Rest InPeace cross impaled in his shoulder attacks her in thecemetery. &quot;It's disgusting,&quot; she says.   Locals relish being involved in the movie, be it ever sohumble. A woman in nearby tiny Hopewell Township, where thefilm is actually being shot, tells neighbors that the insideof her yellow Mercedes will be in the film, and that the crewused her vacuum cleaner. An eye doctor from nearby RobinsonTownship offered the use of 70 glass eyes.   Even the township's Upper Buffalo Presbyterian Church gotinto the act. The crew needed a place for New York caterers,armed with microwave ovens and steamers, to prepare and servelunch. The Rev. H. William Dambach consented. The 52-memberchurch, he says, has its own mission to serve, and besides,it could use the $125-a-day payment. Now church members won'thave to hold their annual strawberry festival or selllemonade at the Washington County fair to help raise $3,000needed to operate the church for the year.   Little did Rev. Dambach know that such manna would causemayhem. False rumors spread that the film was being shot inthe church and its cemetery. The local presbytery receivedcalls from Rev. Dambach's peers saying the movie runs counterto the church's belief in a joyous, not ghoulish,resurrection. &quot;Frankly, I never thought about it,&quot; he says alittle sheepishly. &quot;It's just a movie people see to getscared.&quot;   It's also cool, declares eight-year-old Joey Ladisic. Hisfather, Jeff Ladisic, known locally as Dr. Glass, was hiredto replace windshields and windows that are shattered byzombies. During the filming, he mentioned to directors thathe had a glass eye and would gladly remove it if they neededan eyeless zombie. They said yes. His wife, Jeannie, was sothrilled she took her sons out of school to bring them to theset. Marvels Dr. Glass: &quot;This is a once-in-a lifetimeopportunity.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
