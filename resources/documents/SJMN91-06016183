Otherpreviously fast-growing areas of Sacramento, Modesto and Riverside-SanBernardino all reported decreases.;    Builders and planners say the localincrease reflects a shift in building strategies as the housing market slowedand shows up the very slow building year of 1989, in which only 4,859 housingpermits were issued.;    The preponderance of multifamily permits has a lot todo with the difficulty in building and selling single-family homes. Mostmultifamily units are still considered affordable, either as rentals orentry-level housing for first-time home buyers.;    &quot;The single-family marketis soft, but there is a demand for (condominiums) and especially formultifamily rentals,&quot; said Reid Gustafson, president of Shea Homes of SanJose. Shea has a waiting list for its new North San Jose condominium projectof median-priced units.;    Builders said Santa Clara County had recordedlower permits for four years in a row and had &quot;some catching up&quot; to do.;   &quot;The last two years (1988-1989) have not been really good years. We fellbehind the curve,&quot; said Bob Livengood, a local official of the BuildingIndustry Association.;    &quot;Still, it's significant that we're on the upsidecompared to other counties.&quot;;    Also, many local cities have shifteddevelopment strategies. Instead of large, sprawling single-familydevelopments, planners countywide have encouraged high-density developmentsnear transportation routes and jobs. Several such housing projects got underway in 1990 on tracts of land that had previously been designated forcommercial development.;    Although many of the multifamily permits weregiven in the first half of the year and funding for the projects receivedbefore institutional lenders curtailed lending, local builders say they expectmultifamily permits to continue higher this year, as large projects inEvergreen and Sunnyvale are scheduled to break ground.;    &quot;The moral of thestory is in this valley today if you can produce housing in the $200,000 to$250,000 range, you can sell it,&quot; Livengood said.;    Meanwhile, lack ofconsumer confidence in the economy and a shortage of financing caused by theSandamp;L and banking crises are being cited for the state's overall decline. DuringNovember, 96,600 construction permits were issued for single-family homes andmultifamily complexes -- a 57.2 percent drop compared to November 1989.Housing permits hit a record monthly low of 85,000 in December 1982.;   Because of the continuing decline, the Construction Industry Research Board isrevising its 1990 and 1991 forecasts. The board now predicts that housingproduction will be down 30 percent in 1990 from the year before and 1991 willbe off another 18 percent from 1990.; On the home front; Santa Clara Countywas the only non-Central Valley region in the state to post a gain in totalnew housing permits when comparing the first 11 months of 1990 with the first11 months of 1989. Although new single-family permits in the county were down,permits for new condominiums and apartments were up sharply.;             Permits   Permits  Percent; County          1989    '90   change; ...; Alamedaand; Contra Costa      12,523          6,967         -44.4; S.
