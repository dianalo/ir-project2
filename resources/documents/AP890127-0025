SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists looking at nearly a century ofrecords say they can't discern any warming trend to confirm thethreat of a greenhouse-like heating of the earth.   The heat and drought of last summer helped fuel concern about thegreenhouse theory of climate change, even though scientistscautioned that one unusual season didn't necessarily prove along-term trend.   Now, researchers at the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration report that they have been unable to find evidence ofany overall temperature increase for the United States.   ``The most important result of this study is that there is nostatistically significant evidence of an overall increase in annualtemperature or change in annual precipitation for the contiguousU.S., 1895-1987,'' concluded the authors of the new analysis.   Another leading climate expert, however, cautioned that thefindings don't necessarily knock down the greenhouse theory.   James E. Hansen of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in NewYork said that the new analysis is limited to the United States.   It's not inconsistent with the greenhouse theory for some partsof the world to be warmer, others cooler and some to show no changeat this point, he said in a telephone interview. By the mid-1990s,he went on, the data should show a clearer trend.   ``Assuming the numbers are right, they are not inconsistent''with the greenhouse warming theory, responded John Topping of theClimate Institute, also pointing out that the study covers only theUnited States.   The new study, published in the January edition of GeophysicalResearch Letters, showed no significant change in the nation'saverage temperature or precipitation between 1895 and 1987.   According to the greenhouse theory, the growing amounts of carbondioxide and some other gases in the atmosphere tend to trap heatfrom the sun, warming the earth in somewhat the same way glass warmsa greenhouse.   This drew widespread attention last summer as hot, dry weatherparched fields across much of the nation. Cooler fall temperaturesdropped the national average for the year back to near normal,however.   Scientists at last month's meeting of the American GeophysicalUnion in San Francisco expressed skepticism about whether the effecthas already begun.   In addition, some climate experts contend that warmer weatherwould evaporate water to generate more clouds, and that those cloudswould then deflect some incoming sunlight and cool the earth.   And a study published in the Journal of Climate in Novemberdisclosed that an apparent climate warming of as much as 1 degreeFahrenheit could be the fault of the heat generated by growingcities, since many weather stations are located in urban areas.   The new report was compiled by Kirby Hanson of the NOAA AirResources Laboratory, George A. Maul of the NOAA AtlanticOceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory and Thomas R. Karl ofthe National Climatic Data Center.   They looked at both temperature and moisture since the greenhousetheory holds that a warming of the climate would likely result inchanges in rainfall patterns, causing drought in some areas.   The study analyzed records from some 6,000 observing points over93 years and found considerable year-to-year variation but nolong-term trend other than an increase in precipitation, in thefall, between 1970 and 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
