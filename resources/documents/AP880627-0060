Police said 40 fighters loyal to the Palestine LiberationOrganization chief surrendered. Up to 160 others remained pinneddown awaiting possible safe passage out of the Chatilla camp.   Seven people were killed and 11 wounded in the latesthostilities between fighters of Col. Saeed Mousa's breakawayFatah-Uprising and Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction in Chatillaand the nearby Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camp.   A Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said the dissidents seized control of Chatilla this morning afterthey leveled what was left of the nearly half-mile squareshantytown in a sustained barrage of 25 shells a minute.   Black smoke billowed from the two camps as the fighting ragedthrough the morning with the boom of shell blasts shaking theLebanese capital.   ``You have a last chance to surrender and turn yourselves in tothe Syrian army or face a final onslaught,'' the dissident commandsaid in a statement communicated to the encircled loyalists. Nodeadline was set.   Fatah admitted that the dissidents had stormed Chatilla andcaptured two of four bases seized by Arafat's men a month ago.   The 40 who surrendered left with their hands clasped behindtheir heads. Syrian army officers and Libyan mediators took chargeof them, police said.   The remaining loyalists stopped firing but remained in theirposition waiting for Syrian and Libyan mediators to arrange safeconduct.   The 40 guerrillas and others still trapped inside Chatilla wouldprobably be sent to the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp on the outskirtsof southern Lebanon's port city of Sidon, Palestinian and Lebanesepolice sources said.   That camp is controlled by mainstream PLO guerrillas.   In all, 127 people have been killed and 527 wounded since May 1,when the rival factions began fighting for control of the two campson Beirut's southern outskirts.   A PLO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidAbdul-Amir Abbas, a Lebanese mediator, planned to enter Chatillalater today to try to persuade Arafat's loyalists to lay down armsand evacuate the camp.   The official said the loyalists were willing to abandon the campif the Syrian army gives them safe conduct to refugee camps insouth Lebanon.   Syria has thousands of troops enforcing security in west andsouth Beirut. But the soldiers, who ring Chatilla and Bourjel-Barajneh, have made no move to stop the Palestinian factionalfighting.   The battles flared despite a reconciliation between Arafat andSyrian President Hafez Assad in April after a five-year feud overcontrol of the Palestinian movement.</TEXT></DOC>
