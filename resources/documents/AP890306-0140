It was the first indication of mass starvation in the isolatedcoastal district of Memba. AIM quoted the missionaries as saying allthe deaths occurred in Memba, 240 miles south of the border withTanzania.   Widespread food shortages affect Mozambique, and an estimated 6million of the country's 15 million people need food aid.   AIM's report of starvation deaths could not be confirmedindependently. An AIM reporter who visited the region last weekwrote that he witnessed five deaths from starvation in one town on asingle day.   The region has been hard hit by the country's 12-year-old civilwar and a yearlong drought.   Threats of attacks by rightist rebels, combined with poor roadsand transportation have made it difficult for the government andrelief agencies to provide regular supplies to the remote region,AIM said.   The agency also reported an estimated 600,000 people, mostchildren, have died as a result of the war.   Citing a report produced jointly by UNICEF and the Mozambicangovernment, AIM said the overall casualty figure includes deaths of494,000 children ``from causes directly attributable to malnutritionassociated with the war.''   Mozambique is one of the world's poorest countries. Two of every10 babies born here die before their first birthday, according tothe UNICEF report. As many as 375 children out of 1,000 die beforethe age of five, among the highest rates in the world, the reportsaid.   The war pits the Marxist government against guerrillas of theMozambique National Resistance, whose hit-and-run attacks oncivilian and military targets have severely disrupted the country'seconomy.   South Africa backed the rebels in the early 1980s, but says ithas ceased assistance despite Mozambican claims that Pretoria'ssupport continues.   Rebel attacks shut down 822 health clinics between 1982 and 1987.Only 567 of those have been rebuilt, the report said.   ``Some preventive activities, such as vaccination campaigns, haveto be organized almost clandestinely in order to prevent them frombecoming a target,'' the report added.   A U.S. State Department report last year estimated that 100,000people were killed in the war from 1985 to 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
