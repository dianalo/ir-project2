The Constitution, Judge Bork says, protects economic liberties along with civil rights. &quot;There is no principled philosophic difference between individual economic freedoms and individual freedoms of other sorts,&quot; he wrote in a 1983 article for the American Enterprise Institute.    But the 60-year-old former Yale Law School professor and antitrust expert doesn't extend his belief in free markets to the extremes of some judges and law professors, particularly those from the University of Chicago, where Judge Bork was also trained.    Indeed, he has criticized some judges and professors who measure every legal issue in terms of economic efficiency. Often linked to what is called the &quot;Chicago School,&quot; these judges and professors analyze legal problems on the basis of what is most efficient and cost-effective.    Appeals court Judge Richard Posner of Chicago, for example, also mentioned occasionally as a Supreme Court nominee, has questioned the cost-effectiveness of providing free lawyers to represent prison inmates in civil rights cases. He has proposed a mathematical equation for courts to use in deciding whether to issue preliminary injunctions, and suggested replacing the ineffective adoption system with laws allowing the sale of babies.    But Judge Bork says he wants no part of this. &quot;There are people who seem to think that any subject lends itself to economic analysis, but I'm not one of them,&quot; he said in a 1984 speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. &quot;When you get away from real markets where you can measure values in objective terms like dollars, economics has little, if anything, to contribute.&quot;    &quot;I think society does have values other than economic efficiency,&quot; Judge Bork said, &quot;. . . and I don't think we should run economics into places where it doesn't tell us anything.&quot;    While this means Judge Bork may keep economics out of fields like civil rights, criminal law and free speech, his view leaves plenty of room for economic analysis in other areas. Diane Wood, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, said she would expect Judge Bork to apply economic principles in the fields of contract and personal-injury law, and in cases involving property rights and the government's power to seize land by eminent domain. But nowhere is his economic thinking likely to have greater influence than in antitrust law.    Of persons who have helped shape modern antitrust law, Prof. Wood said, &quot;He is very high on the list.&quot;    His 1978 book, &quot;The Antitrust Paradox,&quot; is referred to often in Supreme Court and appeals court opinions. The book and his earlier writings advance the idea that the federal antitrust laws were intended by Congress to promote consumer welfare and weren't designed to protect small business from large companies or from zealous competition. &quot;I don't think the antitrust law has any values other than economic efficiency,&quot; Judge Bork said in the Chamber of Commerce speech.    His impact on the Supreme Court's antitrust decisions may be profound. In several decisions in recent years, the high court has looked skeptically at claims that some practices are by their very nature anti-competitive. But the court has nevertheless clung to old rules that almost automatically make illegal such practices as group boycotts against a competitor, the tying of the sale of one product or service to another, and the fixing of resale prices.    &quot;There are quite a few cases where the Supreme Court is almost going to an economic approach,&quot; Prof. Wood said, &quot; . . . and Judge Bork could get them to take that last step.&quot; That would mean, for example, that such practices as tying, group boycotts and resale-price setting might be measured on a test of reasonableness -- whether they actually reduced competition.    Judge Bork has refused to jump on other bandwagons. In 1983, he questioned the wisdom of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget or an amendment guaranteeing economic freedom.    On a balanced budget amendment, he questioned how it could be enforced if Congress and the president missed the target. There might be &quot;hundreds, if not thousands, of lawsuits around the country, many of them on inconsistent theories and providing inconsistent results,&quot; he wrote.    On an amendment for economic freedom, he said the wording might have to be broad to cover a variety of activities. That would leave its interpretation in the hands of judges, he wrote, raising the problem of &quot;whether we want the economic policy of the United States to be what the judges say it is.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
