Administration aides suggested that the Iranian assets, held in the U.S. since the crisis over the seizure of the American embassy in Tehran in 1979, might be discussed with Tehran but only after a marked improvment in U.S.-Iranian relations. And that improvement, officials say, should begin with the release of the eight U.S. hostages still held in Lebanon.    Iranian officials appeared to send a signal through a newspaper story yesterday that they would like to link the assets to current bargaining over Western hostages held by Shiite extremists in Lebanon. The Tehran Times carried a report saying Iran might be more helpful in gaining the hostages' release if the assets were released.    The newspaper quoted someone close to the new Iranian president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, as saying: &quot;The first step should be taken by the U.S., and if Tehran is satisfied that its assets will certainly be unfrozen, then the second step will definitely come from Iran.&quot;    White House officials said that Iran hasn't demanded that the assets be unfrozen in the messages that Washington and Tehran have exchanged recently through the Swiss government and other intermediaries. But the White House insisted that it rejects any such feelers, whether official or unofficial.    &quot;We are not willing to link the Iranian assets questions to the hostage question,&quot; said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. &quot;That fits within the definition of our policy of not trading arms or money, or whatever, for hostages and of not paying ransom for hostages.&quot;    U.S. officials say they aren't even clear what Iranian officials mean when they refer to frozen assets. The Iranians apparently are referring to escrow accounts Iran maintains here and to military equipment the U.S. has refused to deliver. The accounts were established in 1981 as part of the negotiations that resulted in the freeing of American hostages from the embassy in Tehran. At that time, the U.S. and Iran agreed to submit to international arbitration billions of dollars in claims the two countries held against each other.    Iran agreed to set up a series of escrow accounts to provide funds for settling claims by American companies and individuals who lost property in the Iranian revolution. Those accounts once held nearly $10 billion, but their value has dropped to less than $1.5 billion as claims have been settled, U.S. officials said.    Iran has claimed that it is owed some $11 billion for undelivered or defective military equipment that it contracted to buy during the reign of the late Shah. U.S. officials consider that figure wildly exaggerated, and say they are working under instructions from the claims tribunal to set a value for equipment that wasn't delivered to Iran. </TEXT></DOC>
