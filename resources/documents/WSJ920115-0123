RYLEE: The central question of concern to women and{that} should be of concern to responsible scientists and tothe Food and Drug Administration is this: What does thescience say?   First, the cumulative knowledge of creditable scientificevidence. Much has been said about what the medical communitysupposedly does not know about silicone implants. Let mebegin by saying what we do know. Dow Corning has studied thesafety of silicones for almost 40 years. In that time, wehave conducted over 10,000 health and safety studies,amassing over 300,000 pages of scientific data. Of thosestudies, 329, which were conducted over the past 30 years,relate specifically to the silicone breast implants. Thesestudies have all been made available to the Food and DrugAdministration and are all now in the public domain.   The conclusion of all those studies is that siliconebreast implants are both safe and effective. . . . Now, safedoes not mean risk-free, but the risks can be known andunderstood so that a woman can make an informed decision. . ..   The second issue I mentioned was the time line. A separateissue from what our cumulative studies tell us about thesafety of implants is the time line issue over which thesestudies were done. This time line has now been reconstructednot by focusing on the accumulated body of scientificstudies, but instead the recent focus has been on isolatedsentence fragments from internal memos which are notscientific. To base any conclusion on the safety of siliconeimplants on internal non-scientific memos is nothing short ofintellectual dishonesty.   At best, a focus on those memos shows a certain naivetewith reference to the science and the product developmentprocess. At worst, it shows a concerted effort to divert ourattention from the science, where it should be, because thereare absolutely no scientific grounds for banning this productbased on science.   This has become a travesty to the millions of women whohave had a compelling need for this device. . . .   In general, the memos being disclosed raise the issue ofwhat our scientific basis was back in 1975, when Dow Corningproduced a modification of its pre-existing device that hadbeen in use for over 11 years. The 1975 product, I might add,is no longer on the market today because we have newgenerations of products. But these memos recorded one side ofan internal dialogue. Those internal memos help guide anddirect the future course of research and development of newevolutionary products, and that's the way it should be.   These memos do not record the existing body of then knownscientific knowledge that Dow Corning had already accumulatedon the safety of silicones in the human body. By 1975, wealready had a foundation of safety studies on siliconesdating back to the early 1950s. These studies consistentlyshowed that the silicones were a safe material for a varietyof implanted devices. By 1975, did we believe that moreresearch was necessary? Of course we did. Any responsiblescientist is always seeking more data and more evidence andmore information. The only debate is which studies should beundertaken next or when.   Did we know then that small quantities of silicone couldbleed through the silicone elastomer envelope? Of course wedid. This was generally known or understood. But neither wenor our colleagues nor the medical profession believed thatthat phenomenon was a safety issue. None of our scientificstudies indicated that that was a safety issue. On thecontrary, all of our scientific studies on that materialshowed no adverse effect.   Did we want to reduce the amount of gel bleed? Of coursewe did, because gel bleed was not a phenomenon thatcontributed to the implant's performance. It was unnecessary,and therefore, we thought that it was expedient to try toreduce or eliminate it in our next generation products asthat technology was acquired. What we're discussing in thesememos is internal discussion by various people, primarilymarketing people, on these issues.   Let me close on the third subject I mentioned about thesememos by urging that this debate on memos instead of sciencecease immediately. Probably the best example I could give ofthis is what the media has referred to as &quot;thecrossed-fingers memo.&quot; Many have claimed that this referencemeant that a Dow Corning employee was lying to physicians byusing crossed fingers when he talked about certain studies.But why didn't someone ask the author of that memo what hemeant? Why didn't people read the entire memo?   The author is a man named Chuck Leach. He is still withDow Corning. He's a 29-year employee with the company, and hehas been devastated and enraged to think that his words of 15years ago have been so mischaracterized and spread. Chuck haswritten letters to the editors explaining that his crossedfingers did not mean that he was lying, but that he washopeful that additional studies would resolve the issue,which was &quot;does gel bleed cause contracture?&quot; One reads hisentire memo. You will see he referred to a then-underwaystudy, which he knew about. So, obviously, when he said wehad studies underway, he was not lying, he was hopeful.   At the time he wrote that memo, since he was in themarketing function, he could not have been aware of all ofthe research and development activities that were underway bya different function. I suspect, however, his retraction hasonly been published in his hometown of Midland, Michigan,although I understand that it may have now gotten on the wireservices.   But obviously, retractions and corrections do not makegood press. They typically do not get the same degree offocus and attention. But the bottom line on this memo is thatthe attention paid to it was wrong. It's probably one of thebest examples I could give you of how a single memo, takenout of context, can distort reality. This results in arelentless disruption of what should be the scientific reviewof the process, the materials and the device.   I would like to close by calling on those who have beenthe critics of implants to bring forward their science. Todate, not a single critic has produced a single scientificstudy that would raise on a scientific basis an issue ofbiosafety of these materials.   What we have heard is speculation and innuendo. That isnot appropriate. I might point out that it would be totallyinappropriate for us as a responsible company to go to theFDA and seek approval by taking speculation and innuendo anda bunch of memos. Instead, we took to the FDA over 30,000pages of documentation in the original PMA. These were notinternal memos, these were not speculation, these were facts.   I'd like for these critics to refocus their energies awayfrom memos and 11th-hour letters and facsimiles. Ask them tobring forth their science, produce their science to the FDAand to you, the media. This is where the debate belongs -- onthe scientific issues. . . .   At the time we filed those {documents} we were convincedbased on the scientific approach that those studies didestablish the safety and the efficacy. We are still convincedof that. Unfortunately, the way the issue has been presentedto the agency, I think FDA has dealt with it as a politicalissue rather than a scientific issue, and I think that isvery unfortunate. . . .   I think for the woman who has had a mastectomy for breastcancer or fibrocystic disease, or -- who was born with acongenital defect, that is an extremely important issue toher. I also think for certain cosmetic augmentations that areother than just pure cosmetic, that may be very important toher. It is not my role in life, nor our company's role, totell her that she cannot do that. I think it is important forthe woman to have the right to make that choice, to make anintelligent, informed decision.</TEXT></DOC>
