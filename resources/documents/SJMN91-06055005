I dreamed about American cities, about American buildings,about American streets that I saw only in movies.;    And of course, I dreamedabout American shops where one could buy (as American movies informed me)anything one liked.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GORBACHEV'S HERE, HE'S THERE, HE'S EVERYWHERE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Feliks Sarnov, a Moscow translator, wrote this article for the Washington Post.  </MEMO><TEXT>     These dreams were quite natural, because for the past five or six years,I'd got a little bit tired of life in Moscow.;    Maybe I could hardly becalled a patriot, but I dreamed about living a month or so in America -- justtaking a vacation and having a rest.;    &quot;A rest from what?&quot; my wife askedsarcastically when I delivered my dreams to her.;    &quot;A rest from, er, ourguests,&quot; I replied, trying to avoid conversation about shops, because it wasshe who went shopping.;    And she had to put away her sarcasm and agree withme, because though it may seem strange, almost the only pleasure of Moscow --sitting in the kitchen with your friends and talking -- is also the mosttiresome! How could this be?;    The point is my wife and I are simple people,and we like to talk about simple things, such as how cold it is out there onthe street today, or what a bright boy our 6-year-old son is, or how nice itis to meet and talk with our friends about nice, simple things.;    But duringthe past few years, we really had no chance of sitting and talking like that,because all our friends, and all the friends of our friends, could speak onlyof what Mikhail Gorbachev had said, or what Gorbachev hadn't said, or whathe'd meant by saying this or that.;    There was no end to such talk. When mywife or I tried casually to tell our friends how smart our little son is, orhow cold it is today out there in the street, nobody listened to us. And itwas rather tiresome.;    When sometimes I tried to tell my friends that thereare other interesting themes and topics and things on our planet thanGorbachev's sayings, they yelled at me like a chorus of maniacs. They criedthat I wasn't a patriot.;    Well, I don't see any patriotism in endless talkthat consists of rather rude disapprovals of what the Soviet president says ordoes, but as I said before, maybe I'm not a patriot.;    But I am a living manof 35, a sane one, I think, and that's why during the last few years I wasdreaming of visiting America, of living a few weeks in that strange countrywhere you can buy everything you want in the shops and be thanked for buyingit (as I'd seen in movies, but to tell the truth, I had a strong doubt ofthis) and where at least I would be able to have a rest from an endlessdiscussion of Gorbachev's sayings or doings.;    Now, my dreams have turnedinto reality. Now I'm right here in Washington.;    I wander in the streetsand enter shops and stores, and when I buy something -- some bread, slices ofcheese or batteries for my Walkman -- I'm always told, &quot;Thank you.&quot; (You maynot believe me, but it's the truth.);    I've found Americans to be very niceand hospitable. They like to have guests, to sit in a warm living room whenit's cold out there in the street and talk to each other.;    And talk theydo: about Gorbachev saying this and Gorbachev doing that, and Gorbachev goinghere and leaving there, and . . . I can't understand it! Maybe they areRussian patriots, all of them.;    I don't know. Sometimes I try to speakabout other things. For example, I try to tell my new friends how bright mylittle son is, how really funny he speaks and . . . well, Americans are verypolite, so they never interrupt me, but I see it's not very interesting forthem.;    And all I can say is that now I've no dreams or illusions aboutAmerica, or Tahiti, or the North Pole, because now I know it's inevitable andthere's no place to escape to. Gorbachev is everywhere!  </TEXT><BYLINE>  FELIKS B.
