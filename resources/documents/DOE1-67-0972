<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-67-0972 </DOCNO><TEXT>The system configuration, layout, and general philosophy for the MTX magnetpower system is described. The vast majority of the magnet power equipmentwas quite successfully used on the ALCATOR-C experiment at the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology. The AC power for the magnet system at MIT wasobtained from a 225MVA alternator. The power for the system at LLNL isobtained directly from the local utility's 230 kV line. This installation,therefore, necessitates the addition of a great deal of equipment inranges from new switchgear in the substation to using existing switchgearobtained from MIT as contractors for intershop electrical isolation aswell as safety isolation for personnel entry into the experimental area.Additionally, some discussion is made of the unique layout of this facilityand the tradeoffs made to accommodate them. 2 refs., 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
