The Texas real-estate developer tookVernon Savings andamp; Loan from obscurity to riches toforeclosure. When the end came in 1987, a hard-to-match 96%of Vernon's loans had gone bad, leaving taxpayers with thethen-record bailout of $1.2 billion.   In the world of Sandamp;L fraud, Vernon sure looks like akingpin. The thrift kept a yacht, &quot;High Spirits,&quot; docked inthe Potomac for the use of politicians. Former House SpeakerJim Wright was accused of reciprocating by trying to get afederal thrift official fired when he refused to ease up onMr. Dixon. Other Vernon officers admitted illegal campaigncontributions to congressmen. The thrift was accused ofprocuring prostitutes for its board members and &quot;femalecompanionship&quot; for a hunting trip where guests included thetop Texas thrift regulator.</LP><TEXT>   It was this kind of evidence oozing out of several failedthrifts that led Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to assign400 prosecutors and financial investigators to root out whathe called a &quot;uniquely sinister exercise in fraud anddishonesty.&quot; When Mr. Dixon was indicted last year, Mr.Thornburgh said the case showed a commitment to punish &quot;thosewho ripped off our financial institutions and have left thetaxpayers of the U.S. holding the bag.&quot;   Mr. Dixon was tried and convicted, but the irony is thathis case is now good precedent that fraud can't explain thethrift crisis. Prosecutors didn't even try to show thatcrimes caused the thrift's collapse.   Although the statutes used to indict Mr. Dixon referred to&quot;conspiracy to defraud the United States&quot; and even&quot;interstate travel in aid of racketeering enterprises,&quot; therewas no evidence of any systematic looting of depositors.Instead, the centerpiece of the trial was testimony by aformer brothel owner about $10,000 in services. Mr. Dixon wasconvicted for misappropriating thrift funds to pay forprostitutes and a California beach house. He faced a possible120 years in jail, with prosecutors asking for a sentencesimilar to the 30-year term given to the former chairman ofVernon.   Instead, Dallas federal Judge A. Joe Fish last week gaveMr. Dixon a sentence of only five years. The judge also gaveprosecutors a piece of his mind. He began by referring tomedia reports &quot;that Mr. Dixon was convicted for causing thefailure of Vernon.&quot; He said, &quot;Frankly, from what I had readin the media before this case came to trial, I thought thatthis is what the government's case would be, and wassurprised after I heard all the evidence and after hearingthe length of the government's investigation that such wasnot the case.&quot;   Instead, Judge Fish said, &quot;There was no showing by theevidence at trial that criminal conduct by Mr. Dixon and therelatively small dollar amounts involved there caused thefailure of Vernon with whatever ultimate loss to thesegovernment insurance agencies or taxpayers. Those are applesand oranges as far as I am concerned, and so I do not thinkthat it is fair to say that we should attribute the reportedcost of the failure of Vernon, whatever the $1 billion-plussum is, to any criminal conduct by Mr. Dixon.&quot;   Judge Fish calculated that all the losses from Mr. Dixon'scrimes came to $611,000, mostly for misappropriating funds topay for the beach house. Judge Fish called this &quot;a far cry inmy mind from the loss of a $1 billion-plus institution.&quot;Judge Fish didn't do the calculation, but this means Mr.Dixon's crimes of $600,000 caused .05% of Vernon's losses of$1.2 billion.   Judge Fish said he would not blame Mr. Dixon for legal,but bad, loans. &quot;All of us acknowledge, looking back athistory, that what we now perceive to be unfairness ofstandards were applied in particular historical context,&quot;Judge Fish said, &quot;such as for example the tribunals that wereestablished during the French Revolution.&quot;   This was not meant as hyperbole. Judge Fish also read froma letter he received urging a light sentence from someonewhose name the judge did not disclose. Judge Fish read fromseveral pages, including as follows:   &quot;While it seems that there is a general lynching partywanting to throw the Sandamp;L crooks in jail, one disparityremains. That disparity is that Vernon Sandamp;L will cost thetax-payers over $1 billion and the head man, Mr. Dixon, hasapparently been convicted of misappropriating thousands ofdollars,&quot; the letter said. &quot;I think politically Washingtonwould like to see an example made of the top man in thefailed Sandamp;Ls. It might take some of the spotlight off the jobor lack of job that the regulators were doing or the timingof some of the bills that Congress passed that reallyfacilitated this whole Sandamp;L fiasco.   &quot;I don't know if what Congress has done is a crime,&quot; theletter continued. &quot;We do know in hindsight that it, plus thelack of diligence in the regulatory bodies, contributed tothe overwhelming bulk of the loss. The people that did thisreally have not had to have the spotlight on them. . . . Ialso sense a lynch-mob mentality and sentiment. I think thatthis is wrong and really will play into the hands of keepingthe focus of attention off where it belongs, namelyWashington, D.C.&quot;   The Don Dixon case proves it's possible to be both sinnerand scapegoat. Yes, he broke laws, but his guilt cannotexplain the collapse of the thrift. The 99.95% explanation ofthe Vernon collapse instead was Mr. Dixon's perfectly legalactivity of perfectly outrageous high-risk lending.   That is, the scandal is not the crimes, but what waslegal. In terms of cost to taxpayers, the blame goes tofederal deposit insurance, which encourages high-risk lendingunder a system of heads bankers win, tails taxpayers lose.Mr. Dixon took more than full advantage of federal depositinsurance. When the Texas real-estate market collapsed,taxpayers paid.   If a 96% bad-loan rate is only &quot;criminal&quot; to the extent ofMr. Dixon's relatively trivial crimes, there are clearimplications for thrift and banking reform. One is that moreregulation is not the answer. The only law that can stop thehigh-risk lending of a Vernon is the law of economics thatyou must pay for the risks you take. Yet the moral hazardcreated by federal deposit insurance remains.   One problem with yelling &quot;fraud&quot; is that politicians getoff the hook. There is also the tendency to lump alloperators of failed thrifts into the same pot. A Don Dixon ora Charles Keating is different from, say, Ernest Fleischer,whose Franklin Savings became controversial for itsrisk-hedging techniques, not its political contributions.Regulators have also hired contingency-fee lawyers to sueDrexel Burnham Lambert and Michael Milken for &quot;fraud&quot; injunk-bond losses by Sandamp;Ls, yet prosecutors failed to provethat a certain grade of debt defines a crime.   It's easier politics to cry criminal] than to do the hardwork of changing the way Washington regulates financialinstitutions. The Dixon case shows that no amount of criminalprosecutions can protect us from what is legal.</TEXT></DOC>
