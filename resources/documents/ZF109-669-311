 The &quot;Best Database with Gray andBlack Packaging&quot; seems to be the computer industry's alternative to &quot;BestNighttime Sitcom Featuring Four Zany Women.&quot;andP;  Increase the number of awardsand you're bound to make more people happy.andM;But when everyone's a winner, who's fooling whom?andM;That's why we asked you to select this year's LOTUS magazine Reader's ChoiceAwards.andP;  We wanted to know-from the field--which software products work foryou and which don't.andP;  No holds barred.andP;  No pulling punches or hedging yourcriticism.andM;We all know there are favorite products, hotly discussed products, andproducts that have great visibility but no usability.andP;  What we sought,however, were the software packages that have enhanced your productivity to asignificant degree, regardless of price or version number.andM;To find out, we asked 3,000 LOTUS readers to rate the software products theyuse, applying only one question to each: &quot;On a scale of one to five, how much[has] each package enhanced your productivity?&quot;andP;  We also asked for commentsrelating to productivity gains.andM;Answers came from a broad spectrum of LOTUS readers, though thei job titles,job functions, and company sizes reflected the readership as a whole.andP;  CEOsand senior and middle managers constituted nearly 60% of the respondents.andO;Almost half of you (42%) work in midsize companies, and the same number workin large companies with more than 1,000 employees.andP;  The remaining 15% are insmall businesses.andP;  And while 14% of you are computer specialists, nearly halfof you are product users first and product evaluators second.andP;  Your jobs aremainstream business occupations: administration, finance, engineering,education, manufacturing, and Randamp;D.andP;  As users of these programs, you're muchmore apt to call 'em as you see 'em.andP;  Labor consultant Jim McCauley ofIthaca, N.Y., called WordPerfect &quot;the most overrated software--a terribleprogram to write with.&quot;andP;  Others disagreed, giving WordPerfect the highestrating of the entire survey.andM;Glen Shepard wrote to us from San Diego, saying that dBase IV &quot;has consumedconsiderable resources and has yet to return anything.&quot;andP;  Return oninvestment--which includes both learning time and the cost of theproduct--seemed to strike a chord, with more of you telling us of yourprofits rather than losses.andP;  Over and over again, you told us that somepackages are indispensable, that they save time, and most important, savemoney.andM;Reducing or containing costs seems much more important to LOTUS readers insmall businesses than to those in larger companies.andP;  Bill Scribner, anexecutive with a small oil company in Cheyenne, Wyo., likes WordPerfectbecause it &quot;reduced the need for a secretary.&quot;andP;  William Bernaski of the NewYork State Department of Environmental Conservation Commission, in Albany,said that dBase III Plus &quot;replaced laborious, error-prone manual clericalfunctions with accurate and efficient procedures.&quot;andM;You measure the strength of these products by their capacity to make your jobeasier, by their ability to save money, and by how consistently they increaseyour productivity.andM;Here are the creme de la creme of microcomputer software products, winnersbecause they meet the only measure that makes sense: These products make iteasier to do real work in the real world.andM;ACCOUNTINGandM;QUICKENandM;Intuit's $59.95 Quicken played David to a field of Goliaths to win firstprize in the accounting field.andP;  Quicken started out life squarely as acheck-writing and personal-finance product, but upgrades pushed it into moreprofessional applications.andP;  All the while it kept the intuitive interfacethat users love.andP;  Conceding that the package isn't suited for balancing thebooks of the Fortune 500, readers were nevertheless nearly unanimous in theirassessment of Quicken as all a small business needs to manage its records.andM;There's &quot;no question&quot; that Quicken can handle tasks bigger than those forwhich it was originally intended, says Andrea Dugan, vice president of 123Accounting Services, an accounting consultancy in Herndon, Va.andP;  &quot;It candefinitely handle account spreads and some of the larger tasks that a smallcompany needs,&quot; she added.andM;Simona Bihl, assistant recorder for Solano County, Calif., uses Quicken tokeep the books for a real estate business she operates on weekends.andP;  &quot;Quickenallows me to know at any point the status of my financial investments.andP;  Andkeeping records of expenses by categories helps me save money,&quot; she says.andM;Bihl's next goal?andP;  To introduce Quicken to her office.andP;  &quot;Well, we can't useit for the whole county,&quot; she acknowledged, &quot;but I can certainly use it totrack the accounts payable and receivable inside my department.&quot;andM;COMMUNICATIONSandM;PROCOMM PLUSandM;Once a $50 shareware program, the original Procomm was updated in 1988 tobecome a full-blown commercial package, and its popularity increaseddramatically.andP;  No wonder.andP;  It had all the bells and whistles of itshigher-priced competitors, and it cost less.andP;  Procomm Plus, the beefed-up,$119 commercial version, remains in the economy class but includes nearlytwice the original's scripting commands, more file transfer protocols, and animproved user interface that has a full complement of pull-down menus.andP;  Thelaw firm Grunfield, Desiderio, Lebowitz andamp; Silverman, in New York City, chosethe package because, says Grunfield CFO Stanley Cohen, &quot;the price was low.&quot;andM;DATABASES (FLAT-FILE)andM;Qandamp;AandM;Combine a word processor, a database, and a &quot;natural language&quot; user interfaceand you have Qandamp;A.andM;Released in 1988 to broad acclaim, Qandamp;A makes it possible for database novicesto find the data they need when they need it.andP;  Enter a command such as &quot;Showall customers with balances greater than $500 and no overdue invoices&quot; and,with a little training, Qandamp;A will display just that.andP;  Switch to the wordprocessor and you can write a letter to the overdue customers.andP;  A few morekeystrokes and you can print letters addressed to each customer that matchedyour database query.andP;  Jerry Bartels, controller of holding company L.B.andO;Industries in Boise, Idaho, says, &quot;I don't have the time for the minutiae ofprogramming, and Qandamp;A is easy to maintain and use.&quot;andP;  Bartels uses Qandamp;A tomonitor his company's truck-leasing subsidiary by tracking the current andfuture locations of its vehicles.andM;DATABASESandM;(RELATIONAL)andM;dBASE IIIandM;PLUSandM;One of the first micro-computer database programs, Ashton-Tate Corp.'s dBasemade its debut in 1979 as Vulcan, the brainchild of software engineer WayneRatliff.andM;Its 1989 incarnation, dBase IV, failed to gain a place in users' heartsbecause it was riddled with glitches and bugs.andP;  Users stayed put and happywith the earlier dBase III Plus.andP;  A no-nonsense upgrade to dBase II, dBaseIIIPlus included pull-down menus that allowed users to dispense with theinfamous and intimidating dBase II &quot;dot prompt.&quot;andP;  dBase III Plus became aninvaluable tool for companies that needed a powerful desktop databaseprogram.andM;Roger Schamp, controller of Christie Electric Corp. in Gardena, Calif.,andO;downloads transaction databases from a Unisys mainframe into dBase III Plus.andO;He needs to print invoices but can't do it from the transaction program.andO;Using dBase III Plus and Concentric Data Systems' Randamp;R Report Writer, Schampis able to keep tighter control on the monthly books, which, he says, &quot;Iwouldn't be able to do in any other fashion.&quot;andM;dBase IV version 1.1 is regaining some of the interest lost by dBase IV, butdBase III Plus remains the database of choice for LOTUS readers.andM;UTILITYandM;NORTON UTILITIES ADVANCEDandM;In the utility category, Norton Utilities Advanced got the nod as the mostproductivity-enhancing package.andP;  However, it was a close race.andP;  Most utilitypackages contain tools for several types of tasks.andP;  Locating, restoring,organizing, and viewing files are just a few of the important attributesthese packages bring to our applications.andP;  Nearly everyone who responded toour survey uses more than one package--each, presumably, for what it doesbest.andM;For example, Kathy Greenberg, a revenue analyst for Pacific Bell, in Anaheim,Calif., cast her vote for Norton Utilities Advanced but says Lotus Magellanis the biggest timesaver when it comes to finding files.andP;  Roger Daoust, anengineer with the City of Chula Vista, Calif., also uses Norton UtilitiesAdvanced and Magellan but raved about the autodialer in PC Tools Deluxe.andO;According to Conrail's Per Madsen, &quot;PC Tools is the best for disk management;Norton Utilities Advanced is best for dealing with disk and file problems.&quot;andM;Apparently, rescuing files is more important to LOTUS readers than organizingthem.andP;  That need gave Norton the edge.andP;  &quot;Norton Utilities Advanced savedseveral key erased files and restored some severe hard-disk problems,&quot;reported J. C. Kaufman, a research manager with Armstrong World Industries inLancaster, Pa.andP;  David L. Dahl, a statistician with the quality assurancedepartment at Outlook Graphics in Neenah, Wis., had a similar story: &quot;NortonUtilities Advanced saved us thousands of dollars that would have been spentfor data reentry and hard-disk fixes.&quot;andM;GRAPHICSandM;HARVARD GRAPHICSandM;Lotus Freelance Plus and Harvard Graphics from Software Publishing Corp. inMountain View, Calif., are traditional close finishers when it comes tosoftware reviews.andP;  In recent reviews and buyers' guides, there isn't morethan a decimal point or two of ratings separating the two programs.andM;Ask users what they think, however, and Harvard Graphics takes the blueribbon.andP;  According to the Gallup Software Poll, 43% of Fortune 1,000businesses use Harvard Graphics; 29% use Freelance.andP;  Roughly similarpercentages--47% and 23%, respectively--showed up in our sample, so it's nosurprise that Harvard Graphics edged out Freelance Plus among LOTUS readers.andM;More people are starting to realize the importance of clear, well-organized,easy to understand business information.andP;  And most readers agreed with RobertB. Jenkins, an epidemiologist with the Veterans Administration Medical Centerin Gainesville, Fla.: &quot;Harvard Graphics [helps produced] better-understoodpresentations and reports and provides visual feedback to workers.&quot;andM;A few readers were more lavish in their praise of Harvard Graphics.andP;  &quot;Mycareer depends on it!&quot; raved Evan Morris, an insurance-marketing specialistwith David L. Cannard, CLU andamp; Associates in Vancouver, Wash.andM;LAN OPERATING SYSTEMandM;ADVANCED NETWAREandM;Someone may want to tell networking companies that the much-touted LANrevolution hasn't exactly produced legions of happy customers.andP;  Readersawarded more bottom-of-the-barrel productivity not enhanced&quot; ratings in theLAN OS category than in any other that LOTUS surveyed.andP;  Perhaps the LAN isn'tyet everything it's promised to be.andM;Allthe news wasn't grim, however.andP;  Some readers were happy with theirnetworks--provided they were running Novell's omni-present NetWare.andP;  Despiteinroads from OS/2 and other players, Novell still enjoys a 60% share of theLAN market, which readers said was significant when it came time to makenetworking decisions.andM;When Bart Reubenson went looking for a LAN, he asked himself, &quot;Who's going tobe there five years from now?&quot;andP;  After evaluating the competition, Reubenson,controller for the CO-Z8 chain of San Francisco Bay area hotels, chose to gowith NetWare because of Novell's reputation and hold on the market.andP;  &quot;There'sgot to be some reason why Novell is the best,&quot; he reasoned.andM;David DeSantis, information systems director for Detail Associates inEnglewood, N.J., is equally happy with his decision to buy NetWare.andP;  DeSantisbelieves that employee productivity at Detail, an environmental consultingfirm, has increased dramatically since he replaced its sneakernet system withNetWare.andP;  &quot;General office expenses and overtime costs have dropped, as well,&quot;he reported.andM;PERSONAL FINANCEandM;QUICKEN 2andM;Intuit Inc.'s Quicken 2 won an easy victory over Andrew Tobias's popularManaging Your Money, thanks to a readership whose number-one priorityapparently is ease of use.andM;&quot;Quicken's simplicity is what makes it work,&quot; says accountant Dugan.andP;  Sheexplains that the program is flexible enough to keep tabs on relativelycomplex financial books but isn't needlessly complicated.andM;The check-writing/personal finance software walks users through the processesof writing and printing checks, categorizing expenses, reconciling accounts,performing basic record-keeping tasks, and producing financial reports.andM;Quicken 3, a July 1989 upgrade, takes the program farther into thesmall-business realm by offering additional types of accounts and morecomplete reporting options.andP;  Quicken's basic input screen, which takes theform of a blank check that users fill out electronically, is a &quot;stroke ofgenius,&quot; Dugan says.andP;  &quot;People who want to use it aren't necessarilyaccountans,&quot; she adds, &quot;but everybody's seen a blank check before, haven'tthey?&quot;andM;TAXandM;PREPARATIONandM;TURBOTAXandM;Filling out tax returns is high on nearly everyone's list of most-hatedactivities.andP;  To ease the annual headache and avoid costly errors, many peopleuse a tax-preparation package.andP;  The package most used and best liked amongLOTUS readers was TurboTax from Chipsoft in San Diego, Calif.andM;One advantage of using a tax package is that it shifts the burden of keepingup with the latest tax-law changes from you to the developer of the softwarepackage.andM;Generally speaking, if you're eligible for a new tax break or liable for anew tax bite, a tax program should tell you.andP;  &quot;Before the deductions werereduced [in the latest round of tax-law changes], I figure TubroTax saved me$1,000 to $1,500 per year,&quot; says Per I. Madsen, manager of operationsimprovement for Conrail, in Philadelphia.andM;Even if you're not saving money, you can save some time and buy some peace ofmind.andP;  As Simona Bihl, the county recorded, put it: &quot;TurboTax helps me, aprocrastinator, meet IRS deadlines accurately and efficiently.andP;  A greatprogram!&quot;andM;DESKTOP PUBLISHINGandM;ALDUS PAGEMAKERandM;The PageMaker vs.andP;  Ventura Publisher debate has been going on since desktoppublishing migrated to the PC from the Macintosh.andP;  Sure, there are otherprograms out there, but they're out there the way Pluto is out there--small,far away, and not particularly compelling.andP;  If you're serious about desktoppublishing with a DOS-based PC, you're using either PageMaker or Ventura and,judging from readership responses, you're fiercely loyal to your program ofchoice.andP;  It was neck and neck, but Aldus's PageMaker won by a nose.andM;It is likely that PageMaker's flexibility for shorter documents gave it aboost over Ventura.andP;  &quot;We don't really do long books, which is what Ventura isbetter for,&quot; says Ann Elbirt, marketing administration manager for AdvancedInstitutional Management Software (AIMS) Inc. in Syosett, N.Y.andP;  &quot;Each piece Iproduce is different, and PageMaker offers me the flexibility I need for eachjob,&quot; she says.andM;Flexibility also topped the list for Bill Johnston, an operations analyst atthe New York Central Mutual Fire Insurance Co. in Edmeston, N.Y.andP;  &quot;WithPageMaker, people are able to experiment with design changes,&quot; he says,explaining that the company's operations department produces in-housenewsletters and bulletins and likes to vary the presentation of each project.andM;Since moving to Microsoft Windows 3.0 and PageMakers for Windows, finishedproducts are delivered more quickly, virtually error free, and at a muchreduced expense, he says.andM;WORD PROCESSINGandM;WORDPERFECTandM;WordPerfect, arguably the most powerful of all word processors, consistentlybeats the competition in versatility, capability, and features.andP;  If it can bedone on a word processor, WordPerfect can do it.andP;  1-2-3 worksheet tables canbe dumped, column widths and all, directly into WordPerfect documents.andO;Desktop-publishing features make it appealing to those who produce more thanmemos.andM;Fred Born, a contract specialist with the Resolution Trust Corp. (RTC) inDallas makes constant use of WordPerfect since the agency's Washingtonheadquarters standardized on the word processor.andP;  Born took RTC's originalsolicitaion of services forms, a six-inch thick stack of documents, and&quot;modified them to conform to our needs.&quot;andP;  With RTC gearing up to deal withthe savings-and-loan trouble in Texas, Born says his staff had to becomefamiliar with WordPerfect &quot;or we'd never get the work done.&quot;andM;WORD-PROCESSING UTILITYandM;RIGHTWRITERandM;Afraid your writing style is too dense?andP;  Not sure when to use the sujenctive?andO;Grammar and style checkers can help you out.andM;RightWriter from Que Software is a grammar-and style-checking program thatcompares your documents against a catalog of grammar rules.andP;  It also includesa spelling checker with 45,000 words.andP;  The combination can produce a documentthat would pass muster with any English teacher.andM;It would also pass the test of any foreign trade council.andP;  Michael Hayes,overseeing import/export operations for Utica Cutlery Co. of Utica, N.Y.,andO;uses RightWriter to &quot;better get our message across.&quot;andM;RightWriter can be tailored to check for five writing styles--business,technical, manual, proposal, or fiction--at three educational levels: generalpublic, high school, and college.andP;  Terry Sjulin, president of SjulinNurseries in Hamburg, Iowa, says that by using RightWriter he has become abetter writer by &quot;anticipating the things it's going to correct.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
