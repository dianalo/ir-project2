At Salomon Brothers Inc., where Mr. Kaufman as recently as six years ago was arguably the nation's most influential economist, the search for a successor doesn't appear to have gotten off the ground. And for the first time in at least 25 years, the big securities firm may have no single economic spokesman or authority.    &quot;I don't think you replace a Henry Kaufman,&quot; says Thomas W. Strauss, president of Salomon.    Not that Mr. Strauss and his colleagues didn't try. After Mr. Kaufman announced his resignation as chief economist and director of research in December, just about everyone at the big securities firm hoped his successor would be Paul Volcker, according to people familiar with the situation. A courtship ensued.    In the course of feting the former Federal Reserve Board chairman, Salomon officials dangled the possibility of a seven-figure annual income, if he would just sign on as the voice of Salomon. Mr. Volcker, who left the Fed in August, apparently wasn't interested in being the next &quot;Dr. Doom&quot; -- the nickname Mr. Kaufman earned for his gloomy forecasts on interest rates during the 1970s and early 1980s.    &quot;I don't think Paul Volcker knows what he wants to do,&quot; says Mr. Strauss. Mr. Volcker couldn't be reached for comment.    On Tuesday, Salomon provided the first indication that it has decided to forgo having a chief economist; it appointed Martin L. Leibowitz, the firm's 51-year-old deputy director of research, to the firm's board and named him chairman of a new research policy committee. Mr. Leibowitz, a managing director in charge of the firm's bond portfolio-analysis group, has said many times he doesn't aspire to being an interest-rate or economic forecaster.    While Mr. Leibowitz isn't filling Mr. Kaufman's shoes, his appointment signals that the firm intends to appoint several individuals to positions previously under Mr. Kaufman's sole control. Salomon, for instance, soon will appoint a head of research operations, a new position, officials at the firm say.    &quot;The elevation of Martin Leibowitz to the board is an indication of the importance and integrity of research within the firm,&quot; says Mr. Strauss. The promotion from within the firm also was partly designed to stave off further defections from Salomon, some of the firm's managing directors say. During the past month, several top officials have resigned from the firm, which is in the midst of turmoil stemming from losses in important operations, anger over layoffs and several internal power struggles.    Just a week ago, many economists and analysts at Salomon assumed the firm's top officials would feel compelled to hire an outsider to succeed Mr. Kaufman. Such speculation diminished this week.    &quot;We have a lot of people who will speak for the firm on economic matters now,&quot; Mr. Strauss says, referring to dozens of economists and analysts in the firm's economic and markets research group, which has a staff of more than 350. &quot;The odds are that it would be surprising&quot; if Salomon now hired a chief economist duplicating the work of its current employees, he adds.    Instead, a rivalry likely will ensue among several Salomon economists in the wake of the departure of the 60-year-old Mr. Kaufman.    Rivalries aren't new at Salomon and traditionally have resulted in some big staff shake-ups. In the past, however, the firm's research department generally avoided the bitter struggles that roiled other parts of the firm -- partly because of Mr. Kaufman's stature and the fact that he hired most of the people in research during the past two decades. </TEXT></DOC>
