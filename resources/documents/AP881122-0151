Allyn Conwell, testifying at the trial of confessed hijackerMohammed Ali Hamadi, also said he was convinced he would be shotwhen he and others were initially taken from the plane.   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and airpiracy in the hijacking during which U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethemwas killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days.   Hamadi has confessed to the hijacking but denies killing Stethem.   Conwell, a 43-year-old Houston executive, said the last 39American hostages aboard the seized TWA jetliner were taken off theplane while Hamadi and his accomplice were sleeping.   He said four American servicemen earlier had been removed fromthe plane by Hezbollah, a radical Shiite Moslem group backed byIran, while the remaining Americans were in the custody of Amal, amore moderate Shiite militia.   As delicate negotiations for the hostages' release ran intosnags, Amal officials told Conwell ``the original hijackers weregetting very upset over the lack of progress in negotiations,'' hetestified.   ``I was told the intention was to return all the hostages to theplane and blow it up,'' Conwell said.   The hostages were shifted around different locations in Beirutuntil their release, he said.   Conwell, who said he had been so ``terrorized that I wasvirtually immobile'' after the plane was hijacked on a flight fromAthens to Rome, told the court that conditions improved for thehostages once they were under control of Amal.   ``I was under the impression that Amal absolutely did not approveof the hijacking and the murder of Stethem,'' he testified. ``Ithink they acted to the best of their ability in a chaoticsituation.''   During a break in the court proceedings, jailers could not freeHamadi from the court security room in which he is locked and had touse a cutting torch to open the door.   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in January 1987 aftercustoms officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.</TEXT></DOC>
