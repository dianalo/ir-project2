That's because the new tax law denies charitable exemption to a group that provides commercial-type insurance, including annuities, as a &quot;substantial&quot; activity; But Congress didn't think of annuities offered by groups to donors who need lifetime income; the law apparently curbs them unintentionally. Such annuities aren't abuses, and the inability to offer them would be a severe setback for charities, says Conrad Teitell, editor of Tax-wise Giving.    Donors often give larger sums if part is used to provide annuities for them; they also get immediate -- albeit discounted -- charitable deductions. Charities like larger gifts, even though the full benefit is delayed. Government staffers agree that the new law may create a problem for charities; the staffs are just starting to consider whether something must be done. Meanwhile, some experts say charities should play safe by not underwriting annuities.    One says the best bet is to let a taxable subsidiary handle annuities.    WHEREFORE W-4? The IRS plugs early filing of the new withholding-tax form.    The new law requires all workers -- about 100 million of them -- to file new W-4s by Oct. 1 to adjust withholding for tax revision. The IRS is eager to get the forms in right away to assure correct withholding in 1987. It has sent forms and posters to employers, urging them to promote early filing. By Dec. 31, it had scheduled nearly 2,000 seminars for businesses and community groups to explain the new W-4.    A 22-minute, line-by-line presentation on videotape may be borrowed from 2,000 libraries or rented from video stores. The IRS's two-hour tax-return program on public TV Feb. 1 will devote a long segment to the W-4. Personal-computer software for use at home or in offices to figure withholding allowances is under test and should be available soon. About the end of February, the IRS plans to issue the booklet &quot;Is My Withholding Correct?&quot; as an aid to double-checking W-4s already filed.    SALES OF ACQUIRED ASSETS can't escape tax under arcane rules.    The tax act's repeal of the General Utilities-case doctrine limits a corporation's ability to dispose of assets tax-free. Yet some tax advisers believed a company still could buy a target concern's stock, strip out some assets, sell part of them, and dispose of the target's stock while taking advantage of arcane rules for consolidated returns of affiliated concerns; the rules would allow offsetting gains and losses.    As a result, the ultimate buyer of assets could step up the assets' basis value to the purchase cost, but neither buyer nor target would pay tax on the asset sales. The New York State Bar Association's tax section urged the Treasury to block such deals as conflicting with the repeal of the General Utilities doctrine. Now the IRS in Notice 8714 says it will amend the consolidated-return rules to make sure that gains are recognized in such transactions.    The new rules will apply to stock acquired after last Jan. 6.    NEGLIGENCE PENALTIES are automatic for people who omitted from their 1984 returns any interest or dividend income reported by third parties to the IRS. Now the IRS is mailing over 1.6 million automatic-penalty notices stemming from matching 1984 returns with those reports.    A $22.5 MILLION REFUND was denied to the estate of Marion du Pont Scott when a U.S. judge in Virginia said its $52.3 million in public-housing-project notes are subject to estate tax under a retroactive clause of the 1984 tax act. Thus, courts continue to split over the retroactivity.    COMPUTER-SOFTWARE development costs incurred before 1986 may qualify for the research credit under the same rules as other products and processes do, IRS Notice 87-12 says. The notice is meant to clear up a long dispute over 1983 IRS rules that restricted credits for software.    A FOURFOLD RISE in revenue comes with its budget increase, the IRS says.    Despite budget cuts elsewhere, the Reagan administration seeks $624 million more for the IRS in fiscal 1988 and says that would raise the tax take by $2.4 billion. The $5.07 billion budgeted is 14% above the $4.45 billion to be spent this year if the IRS gets a $200 million supplemental appropriation that it has asked for. About $80 million of the supplement would be used to carry out the tax act; $120 million would go into the employee retirement system.    The 1988 budget calls for increasing IRS staff by 9,463 positions to 110,661. Most functions would get big boosts. Returns-processing funding would rise 16% to $1.7 billion. Auditing would get $121 million more to add 3,002 positions, meant to raise $14 billion more revenue through 1992. The IRS says it expects a smooth return-filing season this year. But a lingering problem is accounts receivable; they totaled nearly $45 billion on Nov. 30.    The administration would raise the IRS's 1989 budget to $5.36 billion.    IRS Notice 87-16 offers guidance on new law for individual retirement accounts. . . . Robert M. Walsh, a Scottsdale, Ariz., pharmacist, may not take business deductions for lunch just because he is required to stay in the store during lunch hour, the Tax Court held. . . . The IRS appeals unit changed the name of its records automated tracking system (RATS) to the appeals records control system (ARCS). </TEXT></DOC>
