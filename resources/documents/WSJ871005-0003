The secret operation was conducted through the State Department's Office for Public Diplomacy for Latin America and the Caribbean. It appears to have entailed the financing of articles for submission to the editorial pages of major U.S. newspapers.    Among the most detailed examples in the GAO report is one involving a March 11, 1985, opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal prepared by a military historian, John Guilmartin, who was then on the faculty of Rice University in Houston. Mr. Guilmartin, who now teaches at Ohio State University, was paid $500 in the same period by the public diplomacy office under a contract that required him to prepare &quot;an article suitable for general distribution&quot; regarding the military capabilities of Soviet bloc aircraft being shipped to Nicaragua's Sandinista government.    State Department documents obtained yesterday show that the purchase order for Mr. Guilmartin's contract was prepared in mid-December 1984. On March 15, 1985, four days after publication of the Journal article, which also dealt with Soviet aircraft in Nicaragua, Mr. Guilmartin submitted a letter to the State Department informing the office that his work was complete.    A request for payment of $500 was made in the letter by Mr. Guilmartin and approved weeks later, according to the same documents.    A combat veteran of Vietnam and an experienced pilot, Mr. Guilmartin acknowledged yesterday that his government contract &quot;may have stimulated&quot; him to prepare his piece for the Journal but insisted the two were entirely separate. &quot;I started with a fresh sheet of paper and wrote an article,&quot; said Mr. Guilmartin, who said the work was his own and was, in fact, implicitly critical of the administration.    Johnathan Miller, a former White House official who resigned this year amid disclosures in the Iran-Contra affair, was among the officials who supervised Mr. Guilmartin's work for the public diplomacy office. Documents previously released in the Iran-Contra investigation establish that the propaganda operation, though operating out of the State Department, was linked to the National Security Council offices, where, in the same period, Marine Lieut. Col. Oliver North was involved in providing covert military aid to the Contras.    In a memo dated March 13, 1985, that was released with the GAO report, Mr. Miller cited the Wall Street Journal article as among five examples of what he called the &quot;white propaganda&quot; operation mounted from the State Department. The report didn't explain the term. &quot;Prof. Guilmartin has been a consultant to our office and collaborated with our staff in the writing of this piece,&quot; Mr. Miller said in the memo, addressed to then-White House Director of Communications Patrick Buchanan. &quot;It is devastating in its analysis of the Nicaraguan arms buildup,&quot; he said. &quot;Officially, this office has no role in its preparation.&quot;    Robert Bartley, editor of The Wall Street Journal, said the newspaper wasn't informed by Mr. Guilmartin of any consultancy with the State Department, but added that nothing in the GAO analysis challenged the material in the Journal article. &quot;What do we have a GAO for; to belch up things for the partisan interest of congressmen,&quot; said Mr. Bartley, who was critical of the GAO's handling of the investigation.    Mr. Miller also appears to claim credit for influencing an NBC television news piece in March 1985 on the Contra forces opposing Nicaragua's Sandinista government. Other examples cited by Mr. Miller in his memo to Mr. Buchanan include Op-Ed pieces being prepared for the Washington Post and the New York Times under the names of Contra leaders, but it is unclear whether these articles appeared. And Mr. Miller also describes using a &quot;cutout,&quot; or intermediary, to help a Contra resistance leader visit news organizations in Washington.    Some such activities have been previously disclosed by the House and Senate committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair. But the GAO analysis is the clearest finding regarding the legal questions surrounding the operation.    The GAO report consists of documents and a legal analysis provided to the House Foreign Affairs and Government Operations committees. The analysis says that the public diplomacy operation violated &quot;a restriction on the use of appropriated funds for publicity or propaganda purposes not authorized by the Congress.&quot;    But the analysis found insufficient evidence to conclude that the office violated anti-lobbying restrictions, which forbid an agency, without authorization, to use funds to directly or indirectly influence a member of Congress on legislation. </TEXT></DOC>
