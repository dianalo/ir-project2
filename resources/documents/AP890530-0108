Refugees were returning mainly to the western province of Heratand the southern provinces of Kandahar, Nangahar and Logar, saidForeign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani.   Pakistan-based guerrillas were using force in some cases toprevent more refugees from returning, Amani said.   ``Without the refugees the guerrillas have nothing,'' he said.   An estimated one-third of Afghanistan's 15 million populationfled the 11-year-old insurgency against the Soviet-backed communistgovernment headed by President Najib.   Refugees have started to trickle back since Soviet troops leftAfghanistan on Feb. 15, ending a nine-year intervention.   Najib on Monday appealed for refugees to return home and helprebuild the country devastated by a decade of war.   ``Now the peace march is starting. We open our doors to you. Wewill share our bread with you,'' he said in a speech broadcast ongovernment-run television and radio.   In 1987, Najib announced a ``national reconciliation'' andoffered enticements to the 5 million refugees, including returningproperty, granting them special loans and a six-month exemptionfrom military service. By official count, 200,000 refugees haveresponded to the offer.   There are deterrents to the return of families to theirvillages, most which are under guerrilla control. Refugees fear thecontinuing war and land mines, millions of which were placedthroughout the country.   In a related development, Amani said government forcesrecaptured the garrison of Samahkel in Jalalabad, which has beenunder guerrilla attack since March. The garrison fell to the rebelsearly in the siege.   Amani also said the government forces pushed the guerrillas 15miles from the city.   The government claims could not be independently verified butair activity and missiles launched from the capital towardJalalabad indicated fighting continued.</TEXT></DOC>
