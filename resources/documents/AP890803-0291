The International Energy Agency said in its Monthly Oil MarketReport that the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries produced about 21.3 million barrels a day last month, thesame as in June. Those were the highest levels so far this year.   The cartel set a production ceiling of 19.5 million barrels aday for the last half of the year in an effort to keep a firm gripon output and control prices. OPEC set $18 a barrel as a targetprice for the seven types of crudes that it monitors.   But production has remained strong, and prices have weakened.   West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, whichnormally sells at about $2 above OPEC-monitored crudes, has fallennearly $6 since April when it sold at more than $24 a barrel. Afterstabilizing in the $19-$20 range for several weeks this spring andsummer, prices recently slipped to the $18 level.   Analysts see few signs that nations ignoring their new supplyquotas will cut back, and their actions may spur others to cheat aswell. OPEC ministers raised their production ceiling in June from18.5 million barrels a day in the first half of the year to 19.5million.   ``The situation is becoming more dangerous for OPEC,'' saidFergus MacLeod, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London.   OPEC's eight-member monitoring panel will meet in Geneva onSept. 23 to take a look at the market and decide whether to boostthe production cap to 20 million barrels a day in the final threemonths of the year.   The meeting was officially scheduled for just the eightcommittee members, but ministers of the other five member nationsalso were expected to attend.   MacLeod said chances were diminishing that the cartel would liftits output ceiling in the last quarter because of a slowdown indemand for OPEC oil.   Figures supplied by the International Energy Agency put demandfor OPEC oil in the second half of this year at about 21.3 millionbarrels a day, some 400,000 barrels above earlier estimates.   Demand, however, is expected to tumble to about 20.7 millionbarrels a day in the January-June period of 1990, analysts said.   The OPEC nations sharply trimmed their production starting latelast year year to comply with an output accord fashioned inNovember to boost prices. Their cutbacks, combined with accidentsin oil-producing regions like the North Sea and perceptions ofsupply problems due to the Exxon oil spill in Alaska, helped kickprices up to unexpected levels last spring.   Prices have eased recently, however.   The average price of seven major crude brands monitored by OPECwas $16.58 in the last week of July, under the $18 target. But itwas well above the average price of $12.34 recorded at the end oflast November.   To meet the present target, a number of countries would have hadto cut their output, but the energy agency's figures indicate thathasn't happened.   Kuwait, for example, produced an estimated 1.6 million barrels aday in July, above its OPEC quota of 1.1 million barrels a day.Output for the United Arab Emirates, a persistent cheater, wasabout 1.8 million barrels a day, well over its quota of 1 millionbarrels.   Nigeria's output was estimated at 1.6 million barrels a day,higher than its quota of 1.4 million barrels.   Saudia Arabia, the world's No. 1 oil exporter, pumped 4.7million barrels a day last month, about the same as its quota.   Iraq and Iran were recorded at their quota levels of 2.8 millionbarrels a day, as was Venezuela at 1.7 million barrels, the energyagency reported.   The other OPEC members produced near their targets: Indonesia,1.2 million barrels; Ecuador, 300,000 barrels; Algeria, 700,000barrels; Qatar, 400,000 barrels; Libya, 1.1 million barrels; andGabon, 200,000 barrels.   OPEC recently acknowledged that its members supplied more crudeto the world market in June than allowed under their productionagreement.   OPEC differs from other analysts in the way it measuresadherence to its production agreements. It calculates a nation'squota by figuring crude production and then subtracting, or adding,the amount of oil put into, or drawn out, of stocks.   The International Energy Agency is part of the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development, which is made up of 24Western nations, including the United States, Japan, France andWest Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
