The department's ruling covered imports from West Germany,France, Italy, Japan, Romania, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand and theUnited Kingdom. The agency also ruled that bearings from Singaporeand Thailand were being subsidized.   As a result of earlier preliminary rulings in the case, cashdeposits or bonds are being imposed on imports from the ninecountries to offset the price advantages and subsidies.   If the U.S. International Trade Commission makes a final rulingthat the low-priced imports harm U.S. industry, the CommerceDepartment will instruct the Customs Service to collect the finalanti-dumping and countervailing duties.   The department began its investigation after the Torrington Co.in Torrington, Conn., filed a petition last March on behalf of theU.S. bearing industry, alleging that massive dumping by the foreigncountries was damaging the domestic bearing industry. Torrington isthe nation's largest producer of a range of bearings.   David Gridley, the company's industry marketing manager, saidseveral studies had found that a ``substantial number of bearingfactories closed and workers were laid off while at the same timeimports from these foreign countries have been increasing.''   Gridley said the company was very pleased with the ruling andwith the department's in-depth inquiry. The petition resulted in 34anti-dumping and 10 countervailing duty investigations coveringseveral kinds of bearings.   The department said the investigations were the most technicaland complex in several years, and covered more than 25 foreigncompanies.   Imports of anti-friction bearings from the nine countries wereestimated at about $650 million in 1988. Anti-friction bearings areused in the aircraft, automotive, machinery and electronicsindustries.</TEXT></DOC>
