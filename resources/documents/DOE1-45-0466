The program determines the quantity of the fluegas along with the emission of sulfur oxides contained in it. It alsoperforms a number of other related functions. The advantages of usingthis program for routine checks of emissions from the boiler are easyoperation, accurate calculation and elimination of time consuming andcomplicated calculations. It can also utilize former data in the calculationat hand and instantaneously print out these data.</TEXT></DOC>
