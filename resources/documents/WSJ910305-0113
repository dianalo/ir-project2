The Bushadministration has wisely decided not to repeat JimmyCarter's &quot;energy policy&quot; of subsidies, regulation and gaslines. Congress, on the other hand, still seems nostalgic forcardiganomics.   The mostly sensible nature of President Bush's recentenergy proposals is clear from the anguished response theygot around Washington. Energy Secretary James Watkinsintroduced the strategy by noting that &quot;American ingenuity,technology and competition beat government regulation andtaxation every time.&quot; It's hard to find 15 people in EasternEurope who disagree with that, but in Washington the centralplanners march ahead.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Breathtakingly dumb,&quot; declared Senator Al Gore, whocompared U.S. energy use to addiction to &quot;alcohol or drugs.&quot;Americans who've worked hard to enjoy an advanced industrialsociety may not appreciate the Gore metaphor. &quot;Congress won'tpass it,&quot; roared Louisiana Democrat Bennett Johnston,demanding an auto-mileage policy that would force Americansto drive ever-smaller cars.   What seems to bother the critics about the Bush plan isthe relative scarcity of energy &quot;conservation&quot; incentives,meaning government-mandated austerity. But Americans useenergy for freely chosen and presumably useful purposes, suchas work or play. What's wrong with that? The critics alsoseem to want Americans to pay more for gasoline. So while wefought a war in the Mideast in part to prevent Saddam Husseinfrom imposing a political tax on oil, we're supposed toimpose that tax on ourselves instead. What does Congress haveagainst American consumers?   The Bush policy sticks more or less to market principles-- that is, economic reality -- and would try to stimulateenergy production. It would open up small areas of Alaskantundra to oil drilling, which won't damage the caribou anymore than the Alaska pipeline did. It would streamlinelicensing for nuclear plants, which Japan and others seem tobe able to produce safely and economically.   The strategy also tries to wrest natural gas and oilpipeline control from an independent agency, the FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission, that has become the moralequivalent of Gosplan. One estimate is that the Bush proposalto put FERC under Department of Energy management could saveresidential consumers some $200 million a year by 2000.   The Bush plan does have a few Carter look-alikes. Here andthere it offers &quot;incentives&quot; (subsidies) for &quot;renewable&quot;forms of energy, but at least it avoids another synfuelsboondoggle. It throws more taxpayer money at &quot;alternativefuels&quot; such as ethanol.   But the truly awful ideas are coming from Congress andprofessional &quot;environmentalists.&quot; They're enamored inparticular of CAFE, or auto fleet-mileage standards. RichardBryan, the Nevada Democrat, is proposing to raise thisstandard to 40 miles per gallon from the current 27.5. Thismeans auto companies would have to build smaller and lightercars and get stuck with the unpurchased inventory, whileAmericans pay more for the bigger cars they do want.   According to a study for the Competitive EnterpriseInstitute by Harvard public health professor John Graham andBrookings Institution economist Robert Crandall, the Bryanbill also would produce from 2,200 to 3,900 more highwaydeaths a year. Mr. Graham says &quot;the Bryan bill would be asetback to automobile safety that is without precedent,&quot; morethan wiping out any benefit from air bags. Admiral Watkinscalls it &quot;the highway death act of 1991,&quot; which wouldn't&quot;save&quot; all that much energy anyway. The administrationproposes to &quot;study&quot; any change in CAFE, which we hope is away of, well, burying it.   We suppose that &quot;energy policy&quot; is Congress's idea ofdoing something about the politics of the Mideast. But ifthey won't pass Mr. Bush's better ideas, most Americans wouldbe grateful if they just did nothing.</TEXT></DOC>
