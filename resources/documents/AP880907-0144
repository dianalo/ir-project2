Prosecutors on the third day of the trial said the lawenforcement apparatus in the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistansold promotions and accepted gifts from officers who paid bribes toremain on the force.   One of the defendants, Pyotr Begelman, was accused of taking$1,600 from officers to help them get off a waiting list for buyinga new car. Soviets sometimes wait years for a car.   Begelman was quoted in a document read in the Soviet SupremeCouncil as saying it was ``well known that to work in theUzbekistan police or Interior Ministry, you had to give bribes.''   ``And where could you get the money if not from subordinates,''Begelman asked rhetorically.   The charge sheet read in court Wednesday said Begelman bribed anofficial of the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committeein Uzbekistan to become a deputy interior minister in 1982.   Begelman laughed sarcastically as a court reporter read some ofthe things he is accused of doing.   Another co-defendant, identified only as Kh. Norbutaev, wasaccused in the charge sheet of taking 12,000 rubles ($19,047) fromone witness alone, either in cash or in gifts such as alcohol,sheep, shoes, fur hats and a Finnish suit.   Another of the nine defendants stood up in the dock at the startof the session to complain that investigators were using ``moraland psychological pressure'' to make him confess in Moscow'sLefortevo prison, where the accused are being held during a trialthat is expected to last up to eight weeks.   That defendant, former Uzbek Interior Minister Khaidar Yakhyaev,slept during some of the afternoon session.   An attorney for Yakhyaev, 61, said the defendant maintains he isinnocent of all charges. The defendants have not yet been given anopportunity to enter their pleas pending completion of the readingof the charges against them. The indictment runs about 1,500 pages.   On Tuesday, the government finished laying out its case againstBrezhnev's top police official, who was said to have killed himselffollowing discovery of his extravagant lifestyle financed bybribery.   The government charged that Nikolai A. Shchelokov, who served asinterior minister under Brezhnev, took cash bribes as well asextravagant gifts, including wine and pearls.   The principal defendant in the case is Yuri M. Churbanov, aShchelokov deputy who is married to Brezhnev's daughter, Galina.Churbanov's wife has not appeared in court. His lawyer toldreporters she is ill but will testify in defense of her husbandlater in the trial.   The trial is seen as a further attempt to discredit Brezhnev,whose regime is routinely referred to by Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev and his top officials as a period of stagnation.   Western reporters are being allowed to witness the opening daysof the trial and have been told they will also be permitted toattend for the verdict.</TEXT></DOC>
