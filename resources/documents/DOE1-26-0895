The result is reduced revenues and fewer dollars available forexploration and development of new reserves. This has forced innovativecompanies to examine methods to increase production from existing wells.It has been observed that optimizing a fluid removal program can resultin profitable production increases. The non-linear least square curve-fittingtechniques are being applied to fit the production decline of each well.The overall production is curve-fitted as hyperbolic or harmonic declineand each bailing cycle is curve-fitted as an exponential decline. Thebailing cost and other economic overhead are used as the economic limitfor bailing cycle scheduling. Other criteria such as rate of return oninvestment, lease contracts, current gas prices, geographic location,weather conditions and farming activities will be optimized into a workingpriority list for the bailing operation of each well. The ultimate goalis to create a complete management package on a microcomputer that canbe used to continuously evaluate the update of the entire bailing andproduction maintenance program. In this package, artificial intelligencewill be included to optimize the decision-making rules. This new approachwill create an economic benefit for oil and gas production in the AppalachianBasin. This paper describes the development and work completed towardsthis objective.</TEXT></DOC>
