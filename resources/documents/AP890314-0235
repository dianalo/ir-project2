(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There were times when gospel musicveteran Gary McSpadden would show up on the set of the PTL Show onlyto be bumped off the guest list because the religious program hadfilled its hour.   Then, when PTL host Jim Bakker left the program as the result ofa sex scandal, the show asked the once-spurned McSpadden was askedto save the show by becoming the new host. He became ``the new JimBakker,'' the most visible celebrity on the troubled show in FortMill, S.C., for about six months in 1987.   Known as ``the gentleman of gospel music,'' the 46-year-oldMcSpadden still reflects these days about his experiences on theshow at a time when national attention was focused on religiousprograms and fund-raising and the troubles of Jim and Tammy Bakker.   ``I was a fence walker,'' he said. ``I had the privilege of justopening my heart and interviewing people. The joy for me wascreating some stability in all that chaos.   ``The difficult part for me was knowing not what to say. I wasconcerned I might make a big gaffe and contribute to some of theproblems. That was the touchy part for me.''   McSpadden, who joined the show as part of the rescue effort bythe Rev. Jerry Falwell, said he harbors no animosity toward Bakker.   ``I pray for him. I hope they (he and his wife) find themselvesat a point where they can minister the gospel out of the hurts thatthey have felt.   ``I hope that out of all this there comes a sense that the churchis very much alive and well,'' he said. ``I see a vibrancy. Maybe wehad gotten a little slothful of the discipline of our personallives. The church is only as strong as you and me.''   McSpadden, aligned with Falwell in trying to keep the show alive,left the program when Falwell dropped his association with it. Therevamped program is now known as ``Heritage Today.''   ``I watch it on the satellite dish,'' said McSpadden, a gospelmusic singer, writer, producer and publisher who has been a memberof the Oak Ridge Quartet (later country music's Oak Ridge Boys), theStatesmen, the Imperials and the Bill Gaither Trio.   A former $95-a-week singer who spent part of his honeymoon ridinga bus to make a gospel appearance, McSpadden said his stint as hostwas good, but he felt uncomfortable raising money.   ``There seems to be a black hole in Christian TV where the moneygoes,'' he said. ``I don't know what that is. Maybe the guys at CBS,NBC and ABC know where the money goes. It is expensive to do TV andmoney that comes in seems to disappear.   ``I never felt like I had the desire to create the hugeconglomerate it takes to make Christian TV go on. It was interestingto me that I could provide some stability.''   McSpadden, who interrupted his singing career to help his fatherin ministering a non-denominational church for 10 years in FortWorth, Texas, said he hopes the scandals involving TV evangelistsare over.   ``I pray for Jimmy Swaggart, too. When this all began, I startedpraying for them. My wife and I asked God to sort all this out. Ihate to see anything happen to the church. It has been my life,'' hesaid.   ``I'd like to put a period at the end of all these things thathave happened these past few years. And just say it's over, thesemen have asked forgiveness, they are sorry, let's go on. That's whatought to happen.''   He said gospel music has suffered a sales slowdown in the pastfew years but he doesn't know if church scandals have contributed toit.   ``I think there comes with that a certain amount of distrust,''McSpadden said. ``Maybe rightly so. We can all look back and see theElmer Gantry movie. We can all probably see from our childhood wheresome pastor has failed.   ``For me, it's made me look at my own accountability.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, March 24-26</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
