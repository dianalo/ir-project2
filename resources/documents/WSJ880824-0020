Nomani (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> CMD PCS PET </IN><TEXT>   Bargain buyers pushed most cattle futures prices slightly higher.    Prices had dropped Monday amid speculation that consumer demand for beef was eroding just as a large number of cattle had reached the proper weight for slaughter.    Some analysts expect choppy trading for the next few weeks. Before this week's up and down moves, cattle futures prices had been supported by signs that the retail price of beef was holding at near-record highs. However, now traders are concerned that beef purchases by supermarkets will dwindle after the Labor Day holiday.    Analysts are also growing nervous that a large number of cattle will be slaughtered in August and September. Many animals were placed in feedlots for fattening in the spring when grain prices, and thus feed costs, were low. The drought has since raised feed costs.    In trading yesterday, the cattle contract for October delivery rose 0.175 cents a pound to settle at 70.875 cents a pound.    &quot;The market healed itself,&quot; said Charles Levitt, a livestock analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Chicago.    Most pork-belly futures prices rose yesterday. After the close of trading Monday, a July survey by the Agriculture Department indicated that meat processors used two million more pounds of the frozen slabs of uncured bacon than expected.    The department reported that 29.7 million pounds were taken out of cold storage in July, the largest movement of pork bellies during the month of July since 1981.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices closed steady to easier in light trading. September-delivery silver ended unchanged from Monday's close of $6.74 an ounce. December gold was off $1.40 to $441.80 an ounce, while platinum for October delivery eased $6.50 to $539.70 an ounce. According to one analyst, precious metals traders shrugged off the morning's report of a 0.4% seasonally adjusted rise in the U.S. consumer-price index in July, because the figure was at the lower end of the consensus-forecast range of about 0.4% to 0.6%. Precious metals traders also appeared to largely disregard yesterday's lower crude oil prices and limit-drop in soybeans, both disinflationary developments. Considering that the news yesterday worked against inflation-hedge investments such as the precious metals, the analyst said &quot;gold and silver did very well in holding about steady.&quot; One potential price-supporting factor was the announcement by South Korea that it would buy a small amount of gold, which unofficial sources estimated at 20 tons, the analyst said. There were no details about when purchases would begin or how long they might continue. The analyst said South Korea now has in official reserves about $31 million of gold, which at current prices buys only about two tons.    COTTON: Futures prices fell sharply after a U.S. government action that analysts said allowed the purchase of domestic cotton in the U.S. at lower prices. The October-delivery contract at one point in trading yesterday fell its daily limit of two cents a pound, but recovered in part to end with a loss of 1.80 cents, at 50.40 cents a pound. The December-delivery contract declined 1.51 cents to 48.84 cents a pound. According to Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities, New York, a change in regulations by the Secretary of Agriculture now will allow trade firms -- merchants and dealers -- to buy cotton that is being held by the government under loan and also to purchase cotton at the adjusted world price from the 1988-89 crop, which began to be marketed Aug. 1. That price changes daily and is quoted on a weekly basis. Most important, Mr. Simon said, carrying charges will be forgiven by the federal government. These charges can amount to 0.50 cent a pound each month, he said, and thus can become substantial. While the action doesn't make U.S. cotton entirely competitive in the world market, it does bring it closer to global quotations, Mr. Simon said.    ENERGY: Crude-oil futures fell in light trading, with the decline accelerating somewhat as prices went through technical support levels. A number of unconfirmed bearish rumors -- of a possible renewal of hostilities in the Persian Gulf and of renewed excess oil production in the Mideast -- depressed prices. West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery ended at $15.70 a barrel, down 21 cents. After the close yesterday, the American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. gasoline stocks rose 349,000 barrels to 214.8 million barrels in the week ended last Friday; many traders were anticipating a buildup. </TEXT></DOC>
