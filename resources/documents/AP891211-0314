An official of the fund, who spoke on condition he not be named,said Peru had made a payment of $42.3 million on the $800 millionit owes the fund. The payment covers only the arrears sinceSeptember of this year.   The agreement was reached last week between Peru's negotiator,Abel Salinas, and Michal Camdessus, the fund's French managingdirector, the official said.   Owned by 152 governments, the fund negotiates at length withgovernments in financial trouble. It gives its help only when theborrowing government agrees on a set of policies it approves.Usually these include cuts in government spending, especially onofficial payrolls and subsidies, and often a devaluation of thecountry's currency.   Peru has been in trouble with the financial world sincePresident Alan Garcia was elected in 1985 and announced that hewould make only partial payments of interest on the country'sdebts. At that time Peru owed $14 billion abroad. Now the figure iscloser to $20 billion.   Its financial troubles have been worsened by the continuingrebellion of a leftist guerrilla group, the Shining Path, and athriving traffic in drugs.   Peru is one of 10 countries with a total arrears of $3.5 billionto the fund, and so ineligible for more finanical aid from it _ ormuch from anyone else. This year the fund started a series of whatit called ``shadow programs,'' under which governments promised newpolicies but got no immediate money. Vietnam, Zambia, Somalia andnow Peru have started such programs.   If the fund finds they are doing well after a year or so, theywill start getting its financial help.</TEXT></DOC>
