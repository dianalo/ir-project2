The Massachusettsgovernor, for his part, scoffed at Bush's drug proposals and asked``Why haven't these been done in the past seven years?''   Dukakis and Jesse Jackson made quick stops in New Mexico, one offour states that will hold end-of-the-season primaries on June 7,while Bush settled in for a week of strategy sessions at his summerhome in Maine.   ``I don't feel troubled out by somebody pointing out I'm behindin the polls,'' Bush told reporters. ``I'm coming out 10 pointsdown in these polls and I've got five months to fight back.''   ``I like that position,'' he added, noting that he lost Iowa'sfirst-in-the-nation's caucuses in February but came back to clinchthe Republican nomination handily.   Jackson, meanwhile, was wrapping up a 10-day stay in the Westtoday. Jackson has been campaigning hard in California, but pollssuggest he is running well behind Dukakis in the state, with itsbig primary only 11 days away.   There are 314 delegates are at stake in the California contest,and primaries the same day in New Jersey, Montana and New Mexicooffer another 162 delegates. Dukakis hopes to clinch the Democraticnomination in that round of races.   Jackson, who has been focusing less on his slim chance ofwinning the nomination and more on his efforts to influence theDemocratic platform, claimed credit on Thursday for bringing thefront-running Dukakis closer to his point of view on some issues.   ``He is adjusting to a new agenda,'' Jackson told a rally in SanJose, Calif. Dukakis aides, though, say the governor is listeningto what Jackson has to say but not making any major changes in hispositions.   ``We're not going to negotiate our basic stands,'' Dukakisspokesman Leslie Dach said Thursday. ``You're not going to see anykind of fundamental shifts.''   Dukakis himself rarely makes mention of Jackson these days. Hereserves his disdain almost exclusively for the Reaganadministration, particularly Bush, who already has enough delegatesfor the GOP nomination.   The Massachusetts governor was campaigning in Palo Alto, Calif.,on Thursday, hours after Bush called for the creation of aninternational anti-drug strike force, a drug summit, and the denialof government contracts to companies lacking anti-drug programs.   The vice president's proposals, described by aides as a majoranti-drug initiative, came in a speech before he visited adrug-rehabilitation center in Newark, N.J.   Dukakis said that he wasn't impressed with the recommendations.   ``The question is, why haven't these been done in the past sevenyears? Isn't the vice president in charge of this effort?'' heasked, referring to Bush's position as head of an anti-drug taskforce.   Bush arrived Thursday night at his vacation home inKennebunkport, Maine, where he intends to spend a week conferringwith aides and Republican leaders. One topic certain to bediscussed is a string of recent polls indicating Bush is runningbehind Dukakis.   The latest such survey, by ABC News and The Washington Post,gave Dukakis a 13-point advantage. According to the poll publishedin today's editions of the Post, Dukakis leads Bush 53 percent to40 percent.   The survey also suggested that Bush is viewed unfavorably bynearly four times as many people as Dukakis is _ by 37 percent,compared with 10 percent in Dukakis' case.   The Post-ABC survey also said that when voters were asked aboutproblems facing the country, Bush scored better on nationaldefense, but he trailed Dukakis on a dozen other issues, includingthe fight against drugs.   The survey, based on telephone interviews with 1,172 adultsbetween May 19 to May 26, had a margin of error of plus orminus 3percentage points, the newspaper said.   The vice president's pollster, Robert Teeter, said Thursday thatthe Bush campaign was concerned about the recent polls, but saidfindings in May don't necessarily point to trouble in November.   ``You'd rather be ahead. But there surely is no feeling ofcrisis or panic,'' Teeter said. ``We're a long way ahead of theelection.''   Meanwhile, both Democrats continued to hammer away at what isbecoming a familiar campaign theme _ the administration's dealingswith Panama's military leader, Manuel Antonio Noriega.   Jackson pointed to the ``disgraceful practice of negotiatingwith drug dealers, which discredits our government and is beneathour dignity.''   And Dukakis said, ``I'm going to continue to insist on a fullexplanation from the administration about what's going on'' withNoriega.   ``Are there links with the CIA? Who were the people that wereinvolved in drug-running and profit-skimming? And who was it inthis administration who thought that made sense?'' he asked.   The Reagan administration has been trying for months to induceNoriega to relinquish his post. The general is under U.S.indictment on drug-trafficking charges, which the administrationhad offered to drop to get him out of power.   Dukakis, meanwhile, was facing a problem at home thatRepublicans hope will prove an embarrassment _ a $110 million taxincrease that is headed for his desk. Dukakis makes frequentreference when campaigning to his reputation as a tax-cuttinggovernor.   The tax package includes $70 million to tie the state income taxto the federal code and $40 million from a cigarette tax, and isaimed at helping alleviate budget problems. However, the governorhas insisted that the state budget can be balanced without the taxproposal.</TEXT></DOC>
