In its best quarter since the second quarter of 1978, the steelmaker earned $59.5 million, or $1.67 a share, compared with $30.2 million, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales jumped 12.6% to $920.6 million from $817.6 million.    The company cited an increase in steel prices, an earlier-than-expected return to operations of its key iron-making facility, and particularly strong results in its Joseph T. Ryerson andamp; Son Inc. unit, a chain of steel service centers.    The other major steel companies plan to report next week, and their results are also expected to be much improved from last year.    &quot;We're looking for another reasonably good year assuming that the economy doesn't slip,&quot; Frank W. Luerrsen, chairman, said. However, he said he expects demand for domestic steel throughout the industry to be relatively flat in 1988.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Inland closed at $28.125 down 25 cents. The company's results were released after the market closed.    The latest quarter included a $24.2 million benefit from a tax-loss carry-forward, a $50.8 million pretax benefit from the settlement of recent litigation and a $23 million pretax provision for costs associated with the shutdown of facilities.    The year-ago quarter included a $9.5 million loss from discontinued operations as well as a $49 million credit for last-in, first-out, or LIFO, accounting, a $26 million pretax gain from the sale of certain assets, and a $9.5 million pretax provision for the costs associated with the shutdown of facilities.    In the year, net was $145 million, or $4.14 a share, including a $33.3 million benefit from tax-loss carry-forwards and a $50 million investment tax credit. In 1986, net was $19.3 million, or 40 cents a share, including a $15.5 million loss from discontinued operations as well as a $64 million pretax LIFO gain.    Sales increased 8.8% to $3.45 billion from $3.17 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
