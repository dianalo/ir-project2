Airborne concentrationsof fibers greater than 5 microns in length per cubic centimeter (f/cc)ranged from 0.1 to 40.9 f/cc. Average exposure in the mule-spinning,ring-spinning, spin-doffing, dry-twisting, winding, spool-winding, winder-fixing,and tape-weaving areas exceeded the emergency temporary standard forasbestos dust of 5 fibers per milliliter greater than 5 microns in lengthfor an 8-hour time-weighted exposure. Forty-five samples exceeded the15-minute concentration limit of 10 fibers per milliliter.</TEXT></DOC>
