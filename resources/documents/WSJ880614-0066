Healthy-looking folks striding down a city sidewalk are frozen in their tracks. A figure, representing a blood-cholesterol level, is superimposed over each. &quot;Your number could be too high,&quot; an announcer intones. &quot;You can't tell, but your doctor can.&quot;    As it ends, the jagged line of a heart monitor goes flat and an alarm whines, signaling a fatal heart attack. The announcer warns, &quot;Get your number down before your number's up.&quot;    Sobering advice from a public-spirited health agency? Guess again. The message, though it says nothing about drugs, is really a sales pitch being tried out by Merck andamp; Co., the maker of a new cholesterol-lowering pill.    Cholesterol is much in the news these days, as well it should be. There is mounting evidence that lowering high blood levels of the substance lowers the risk of coronary heart disease. But the real reasons more people are reading about cholesterol, talking about it at parties and asking their doctors about it have more to do with marketing than with medicine. The Merck TV ad is but one piece of a multimillion-dollar &quot;education&quot; campaign inspired, organized and paid for by food, drug and lab-equipment companies that have much to gain by getting America upset about cholesterol.    Despite the stream of findings coming out of laboratories, the sales of cholesterol-lowering drugs are still modest -- a few hundred million dollars annually, compared with more than $2 billion for, say, blood-pressure pills. That's because even with the current flood of publicity, most people whose blood cholesterol is too high by the latest consensus aren't aware of it. Many of those who do know they are at risk aren't doing anything about it. And many doctors don't take the problem seriously. Says Merck's marketing chief, Jerry T. Jackson: &quot;We've had to develop a market as well as develop a drug.&quot;    If marketers like him get their way, the public's cholesterol concerns will soar in the coming months. Malls of the nation are beginning to sprout with on-the-spot cholesterol-screening booths. They have sponsors like CPC International, a maker of cooking oils, and General Foods, which sells some high-fiber cereals. Merck will soon begin teaching hospitals and clinics how to set up their own screenings -- and reap the public good will that often results. Doctors' waiting rooms display brochures and wall charts raising the cholesterol alarm, most of them paid for by pharmaceutical companies like Merck, Bristol-Myers, Warner-Lambert and Upjohn.    The public isn't their only target. Quaker Oats' publicists recently sponsored a seminar for the medical press highlighting new research on the cholesterol-fighting power of high-fiber foods -- like oatmeal. The information is available to science reporters whether or not Quaker Oats hands it out, but this makes it easy for them. Pretty soon there's a feature on cholesterol on the 6 o'clock news.    Doctors are a particular focus. Many of them, until recently, were pretty skeptical about the importance of cholesterol, and some still are. But two things are changing their minds: new research -- and publicity about that research. Drug companies subsidize both. Doctors' medical journals are bulging with reports related to cholesterol and ads for cholesterol-reducing drugs and in-office blood-testing machines (which let the doctor collect the test fees, rather than some lab).    It's all beginning to have an effect. Joseph Diana, a physician in Little Falls, N.J., is amazed by the recent clamoring for cholesterol testing or treatment by his patients. &quot;People who never even mentioned cholesterol before are pressing me to do something for them,&quot; he says.    But the corporate full-court press is also drawing some boos. The Food and Drug Administration criticized Warner-Lambert, for instance, for sending doctors a barrage of letters telling about a study in which its anti-cholesterol drug Lopid appeared to reduce second heart attacks. &quot;All claims from the study are premature and unsubstantiated,&quot; said the FDA, which hasn't approved the drug for this use. But criticism or no, Warner-Lambert's move worked; physicians now are prescribing a lot more Lopid.    Some critics complain that under the cloak of public service, companies are, in effect, pushing prescription drugs to the public. They fear the campaigns will alarm or confuse, and may prompt drug overuse. &quot;No matter how altruistic they are, aggressive drug-company promotions produce an excessive reliance by doctors on medication when diet and exercise can often be as good,&quot; says Norman Kaplan, a professor at Southwestern Medical School in Dallas. &quot;There already is widespread overuse of diabetes and hypertension drugs. I suspect the same will happen with cholesterol.&quot;    Others say consumers should be clearly told the source of the information or free blood test they're offered -- and perhaps of their new health fears. &quot;We're worried about bias,&quot; says Sidney Wolfe, the director of the Health Research Group, a consumer advocacy group. &quot;All this company-funded promotion is because there now are drugs and tests the companies can push on the doctors.&quot;    The companies reply that many physicians continue to undertreat high cholesterol, often because of outdated notions of what levels are safe. They also note that they do recommend treating most high cholesterol first with a diet low in animal fats.    But the companies know such advice often can't be heeded. &quot;Despite everything I try, few patients stick to diets,&quot; Stanley F. Bernstein, a doctor in Pompton Lakes, N.J., told a Merck salesman. &quot;They want the magic pill so they can continue eating pizza, ice cream and whatever junk they want.&quot;    The drumbeat of news sending patients to these doctors results, in part, from some masterly exploitation of medical developments. One came a year ago, when researchers at the University of Southern California produced the first preliminary evidence that sharply lowering high cholesterol levels, through drugs and diet, can retard or even reverse the buildup of fatty deposits in coronary arteries. The study was partly paid for by Upjohn, whose drug Colestid was used in it. Upjohn and its New York public-relations firm, Manning, Selvage andamp; Lee, showered attention on the press, generating widespread coverage.    Then last October, the government's National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute issued a report urging doctors to screen every adult patient for cholesterol and treat -- though not in all cases with drugs -- all those who have readings above 200. That level differed sharply from previous recommendations and described many more people as being at risk. &quot;The importance of that report can't be overstated,&quot; says Ted Klein, a drug-industry P.R. man in New York. &quot;It practically ordered doctors to treat the problem much sooner than before.&quot;    Industry dollars spread the word. Merck, three other drug companies and Boehringer Mannheim, a maker of small cholesterol-testing devices for doctors' offices, spent $725,000 printing and mailing the aggressive new guidelines to 130,000 physicians -- far wider dissemination than the federal institute planned. Several other drug companies put the guidelines on handy charts and laminated cards easily referred to by a doctor. Merck also is spending $400,000 to finance an American Heart Association program teaching 40,000 doctors to treat cholesterol according to the guidelines. The AHA's press releases don't mention the corporate backing, although its materials do include a reference in small letters to a corporate grant.    The clincher for many doctors and their patients may have come last November, when Finnish researchers reported that Warner-Lambert's Lopid cut the risk of second heart attacks. Although the report appeared in the highly visible New England Journal of Medicine, Warner-Lambert left nothing to chance. In the publicity drive that drew the FDA's displeasure, the company trumpeted the news through something called the International Lipid Information Bureau.    A spokeswoman calls the ILIB an information &quot;clearinghouse&quot; for researchers, doctors and the public. But it is one Warner-Lambert created, finances and directs, and it acts like an old-fashioned P.R. operation. The ILIB called reporters weeks ahead of time, alerting them that the study would come out. When it did, Warner-Lambert wrote to tens of thousands of doctors and paid for an ILIB-run news conference that attracted dozens of reporters and generated front-page news stories.    Warner-Lambert brought four of the Finnish report's authors to the New York news conference. Next it flew them -- in its corporate jet and accompanied by the company's chairman, Joseph Williams -- to Anaheim, Calif., where they spoke to a big cardiologists' meeting. Warner-Lambert honored the researchers at a dinner, and Mr. Williams gave each a souvenir clock from Tiffany.    For its part, Merck timed its big push around the introduction last year of Mevacor, a drug widely accepted as more potent, simpler to use and having fewer side effects than earlier cholesterol-lowering drugs. One thing Merck did was help the Pennsylvania chapter of the American Heart Association lobby with the state legislature for a &quot;cholesterol awareness week,&quot; setting up a cholesterol-free brunch for legislators that included free blood tests. &quot;It was covered by all the local papers, TV and radio,&quot; says a pleased Linda Greaver of the AHA -- who notes that it couldn't have been done without Merck. The company says it now is flooded with requests from state and private health agencies and hospitals seeking their own P.R. bonanza from the cholesterol craze.    How well these things can work is clear from a public screening Merck and Boehringer helped set up last January in Sacramento, Calif. With $15,000 from Merck and 120 blood-testing machines on loan from Boehringer, Sacramento's Sutter Memorial Hospital screened 62,000 people in one week at a local shopping mall. &quot;The publicity gave our heart institute visibility,&quot; says the hospital's marketing chief, Catherine Driekas.    The benefits to Merck and Boehringer were less immediate, but they will come. Seventy percent of the people tested were above the 200-point cholesterol level, and all were advised to see their doctors.    ---              The Battle to Control Cholesterol    Adults With High Levels...
