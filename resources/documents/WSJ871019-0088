Their accounts are using &quot;portfolio insurance,&quot; a hedging technique that requires them to keep selling the more the stock market falls.    To its users, portfolio insurance is a sophisticated way to sidestep some of the damage in a collapse like last week's 235-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. &quot;It's working exactly like we expected,&quot; said Jeremy Evnine, a futures specialist at Wells Fargo Investment Advisors. His firm hedges about $9 billion of clients' accounts this way.    But some critics worry that recent trading by portfolio insurers may be making the market's slump even worse. Continued pressure from portfolio insurers may cause other investors to throw in the towel, too -- touching off even more portfolio-insurance activity. &quot;That sort of thing can lead to financial meltdown,&quot; warned John Phelan, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, in a speech last year.    Portfolio insurance was devised in the late 1970s by Hayne Leland and Mark Rubenstein, two California professors. It isn't formal insurance, in the sense of guaranteeing against loss. Rather, it's a method of hedging a portfolio of stocks, either by selling stocks themselves, or futures contracts on stock indexes, when the market falls. Both methods have about the same effect; futures trading is more popular because it's faster and less costly.    When the stock market rises -- as it did until August -- the hedge is hardly used, and investors participate in a bull market. But when stocks fall, investors start selling futures, usually contracts tied to the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index. Doing so helps shield the portfolio from the full brunt of further price drops.    Here's how: The portfolio insurer sells futures contracts at index levels that, in a falling market, are higher than they will be later. The proceeds of the sales are invested in short-term securities that pay interest, such as Treasury bills. As the market falls, the portfolio's stocks lose value, but so do the futures contracts tied to the stock index. When the futures contracts mature, the money required to close them out is less than the amounts taken in by selling them. This profit offsets to some degree any added losses on stocks in the portfolio.    As stocks peaked in late August, at least $60 billion of assets were covered by portfolio insurance, though most hedge levels had been lowered to nearly zero because of the bull market. Estimates of market activity suggest that portfolio insurers have sold perhaps $10 billion to $20 billion of stock-index futures since then, as they began putting hedges in place.    On a day like last Friday's 108.35-point drop in the industrial average, &quot;we had to do multiple rounds of hedging within the day,&quot; said Larry Edwards, president of Leland O'Brien Rubenstein Associates Inc., a major provider of portfolio insurance.    Portfolio insurers have limited flexibility on when they trade; their hedge levels are dictated by computer models. Typically, a 3% drop in the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index is enough to require slight additional hedging. Industry participants estimate that most portfolio insurers are 20% to 65% hedged currently.    Such steady selling of stock-index futures puts pressure on futures prices -- and soon afterward, the overall stock market. &quot;You just try to get out of the way,&quot; said Thomas F. Cooke, a broker on the New York Stock Exchange floor, after Friday's rout.    What is worrisome to stock traders is the way that portfolio insurance interacts with what is loosely known as &quot;program trading.&quot; When portfolio insurers rush to sell futures, the futures prices often become depressed relative to stocks. At that stage, arbitragers begin buying what they regard as &quot;cheap&quot; stock-index futures while selling offsetting baskets of the underlying stocks.    These &quot;sell programs&quot; can help drive stock prices even lower, creating a vicious circle for a while. On Friday, for example, the December-maturing Sandamp;P futures, which in mid-October would be expected to trade about two points above the cash index, sunk to a discount several times during the afternoon -- enough to trigger more sell programs and send stocks sinking further.    Still, many big money managers have wanted to &quot;lock in&quot; gains of the bull market without selling stocks outright. So they have flocked to portfolio insurance in recent years. Big portfolio insurance providers include the investment units of Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co., J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. and Chase Manhattan Corp. Their clients have included the pension plans of Manville Corp., Aluminum Co. of America and the state of Virginia.    Proponents of portfolio insurance argue that in a stock-market plunge, there's going to be plenty of selling anyway. Portfolio insurance simply provides a disciplined, controlled approach, said Wells Fargo's Mr. Evnine. If anything, portfolio insurance users should be less prone to panic than other investors, defenders of the technique argue.    Besides, financial markets have changed in the past few years so that sudden moves tend to show up in futures markets first, said Richard Sandor, a top futures specialist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. &quot;This is one of the natural roles of futures,&quot; he said. In particular, Mr. Sandor said, stock index futures are so liquid and have such low trading costs that many traders find them easier to use than the actual underlying stock market.    While portfolio insurance has helped trim losses for many big investors, it hasn't shielded them entirely. Prof. Leland, a founder and director of Leland O'Brien Rubenstein, cited the example of an account that began in late August, seeking to prevent more than a 5% loss over the next year. It's probably down about 8.3% now, he said, compared with the overall market's approximately 15% decline from its high.    Such an account is currently about 60% hedged, Prof. Leland said, up from 25% in late August. It should still meet its minimum return of minus-5%, he added, because the hedging process indirectly generates interest income about equal to the Treasury bill rate. And if stocks should recover, the hedge will be unwound, he added.    More typical would be an account seeking to lose no more than 10% over the next three years, Prof. Leland said. Its hedging costs would be lower, and it would participate more fully in a bull market. But it would be only 20% hedged at present, up from zero in late August. It would be showing a 13.4% loss on its portfolio. Again, the account eventually should meet its minus-10% target, Prof. Leland said, because of indirect interest income from the hedge.    Most clients &quot;believe they can afford some short-term losses&quot; as long as portfolio insurance protects them from an utter wipeout, Prof. Leland said. &quot;All the clients we've talked to this week are quite pleased they have this protection.&quot;    What's unclear, though, is how futures markets would function if stocks were in a free fall. The new head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, David Ruder, has already expressed concern about futures volatility and suggested that new regulatory steps may be needed. </TEXT></DOC>
