The action threatens to delay next week's close of theOctober trading account, and comes less than two months afterthe market suffered severe disruption from a stock fraud.</LP><TEXT>   Floor traders, who have gone on strike several times inrecent months, are angry at the prospect of around 300 joblosses due to impending changes in the way the market willoperate.   Recent legislation has encouraged brokers and banks to setup new trading houses in partnership with each other. The newinstitutions, called Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare, orSIM, are due to start operating from the start of 1993, andwill result in the disappearance of many independent smallbrokers who will be too small to compete.   In a parallel development, the Milan market is due to movefrom its current antiquated open-outcry trading system to afully screen-based system by the end of next year, renderingtraditional floor traders obsolete.   &quot;A very small number of brokers have written to floortraders pledging work for them in the future, but most aresimply sticking to the contracts which enable them to dismisstraders at short notice,&quot; said one trader.   Traders are demanding that stock market authorities shouldrequire brokers transforming themselves into SIMs to employfloor traders who previously worked for them.   The timing of the strike doesn't have universal supportamong the floor traders, however. Tito Rainis, president ofthe floor traders' association, has resigned after failing topersuade his colleagues to pursue other forms of actionfirst, and has been replaced by a more militant colleague,Enrico Tagliabue.   If the strike continues into next week it could delayWednesday's close of the October trading account, potentiallycreating payment delays later in the month for investors whobought or sold stock during the period from mid-September tomid-October.</TEXT></DOC>
