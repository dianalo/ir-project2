At the close the Financial Times 100-share index was up 1.1points, or .05 percent, at 2054.7.   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index was down 4.9 pointsat 1686.1, reflecting losses by several major capitalized stocks.Volume was thin, as 468.1 million shares changed hands, comparedwith Friday's 648.1 million shares.   Shares got off to a buoyant start on the back of continuedenthusiasm following Friday's rally in London and on Wall Street.But the positive tone wore thin as participants steered clear ofthe market and as doubts about the underlying health of the Britisheconomy returned.   ``There's a general degree of uncertainty'' about the Britisheconomic picture, said one trader.   A major worry at the moment is whether higher wage settlementswill add to inflationary pressures, he added.   There was little reaction to news that British retail sales inMarch were unchanged in volume terms from the previous month, whilerising 4.7 percent from a year earlier.   While perhaps signaling a slowing of consumer demand, theprovisional figures could be revised significantly in coming weeks,dealers said.</TEXT></DOC>
