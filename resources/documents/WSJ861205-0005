Frederick H. Joseph, speaking at the Securities Industry Association's annual conference here, said the use of phony information was one of several ploys to keep backers of hostile takeovers from knowing the identity of target companies before the takeover bids were announced publicly.    Mr. Joseph added, though, that while Drexel was taking such security steps, &quot;Dennis Levine was telling all his friends about the transactions.&quot;    Drexel's very successful business in high-yield, &quot;junk&quot; bonds, which has fueled the rise in hostile takeover activity in recent years, is the subject of a federal investigation of insider trading that has already caught former Drexel investment banker Dennis B. Levine and arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky.    Drexel leaped to prominence in the takeover business both because of the amount of money it raised for suitors and its speed in raising it, mostly through the &quot;junk&quot; securities. Drexel typically issues the suitor a letter at the time a takeover bid is announced saying that Drexel is &quot;highly confident&quot; it can raise the funds necessary to finance the bid. What has been behind that confidence is a stable of wealthy investors willing to invest in Drexel deals.    But gauging investor willingness to commit funds before issuing such a &quot;highly confident letter&quot; has posed a thorny problem, Mr. Joseph said. He noted that if Drexel were to tell 150 or 200 institutions about a secret takeover bid before it was announced, &quot;you're not going to have a secret&quot; very long.    Drexel assembled its stable of investors a couple of years ago by asking them to invest largely on blind faith. Mr. Joseph said that investors were asked if they were willing to put at least $10 million each into a Drexel hostile takeover without knowing the target's identity. Those that were willing, he said, were sent an envelope with details of the target company. The envelope came with an admonition not to open it until the bid was announced because the envelope contained confidential information, he said. Mr. Joseph didn't explain why it was necessary to distribute envelopes in advance of bids in the first place.    The envelope approach failed, as apparently investors opened them prematurely and may also have traded on the information. &quot;We found the stock {price} started to rise&quot; before the bid was announced, Mr. Joseph said.    So Drexel moved to the concept of the &quot;disguised transaction,&quot; he said. Potential investors were asked to back a takeover of an unnamed company whose financial information Drexel provided. But to keep investors from misusing the information, Drexel manipulated the numbers, making them different and somewhat worse than those of the actual target company.    The result, he said, was if an investor tried to guess the target's identity and trade on the information, he would &quot;get the company wrong.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
