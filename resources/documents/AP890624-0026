Iran and the Soviet Union ended almost a decade of chillyrelations by signing a long-term cooperation pact Friday, with thepossibility that an arms deal may follow.   The pact was signed at the end of a visit to Moscow by thespeaker of Iran's parliament, Hashemi Rafsanjani. A communiqueissued by both sides said the two nations agreed ``to build anddevelop good neighborly relations on the principles of equality.''   Rafsanjani, the acting commander of Iran's armed forces, is thehighest ranking Iranian official to visit Moscow since the 1979revolution that crushed the Iranian Communist Party and sent mobsinto the streets shouting ``Death to America, Death to Russia!''   A senior U.S. official told journalists Friday he thought theSoviets were ``reverting to type'' in their dealings with Iran.   The official, who refused to allow his name or title to be used,explained he believes the Soviet moves harkened back to a tendency``to try to take advantage of Western governments.''   The United States severed relations with Iran in 1980, fivemonths after militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. PresidentBush has said Iran must renounce terrorism and help free Americansheld hostage in Lebanon before relations can be resumed.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the House ForeignAffairs Committee this week the United States is ``concerned aboutthe possibility of weapons transfers.''   ``We indicated our concern across the whole spectrum of questionsinvolving proliferation of missiles and chemical technology,'' Bakersaid about his meeting in Moscow last month with Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.   He said U.S. policy toward Iran would be guided by developmentsin that nation, not by Iran's relationship with the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
