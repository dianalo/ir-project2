The government, which made no promises after newspaper editorAlvaro Gomez Hurtado was abducted May 29, indicated after hisrelease Wednesday night that it might talk to the guerrillas.   Church bells rang and drivers honked horns around this capitalcity of 6 million after the release of the 69-year-old GomezHurtado, who had been abducted in a hail of submachine gunfire thatkilled one of his bodyguards.   Gomez Hurtado, the Conservative party candidate who lost the1986 presidential race to President Virgilio Barco Vargas, is thesome of former President Laureano Gomez Hurtado.   In a telephone interview, he said he was released on theoutskirts of Bogota, where he caught a taxi to his home.   About 5,000 people joyfully screaming ``Alvaro, Alvaro, Alvaro''gathered in a park in front of his apartment building within anhour.   Gomez Hurtado, flanked by his wife and other family members,smiled as he waved to the crowd from the window of his apartment.   Leftist guerrillas, right-wing death squads and powerful drugtraffickers are active in Colombia and have kidnapped and killedpublic officials in the last five years.   As the editor of the Bogota daily El Siglo, Gomez Hurtado'scolumns favored a military solution to the guerrilla problem. Butin the interview, he seemed to have changed his position.   ``The episode of my kidnapping has been a confirmation that weare living in difficult times and that it is necessary to look fornational reconciliation,'' he said, referring to the possibility ofpeace negotiations.   The April 19 Movement, one of five guerrilla groups in Colombia,had said it kidnapped Gomez Hurtado and was demanding peace talks.   Barco's government refused to make any promises to the rebelband, known as M-19. But the rebels agreed last week to releaseGomez Hurtado anyway, perhaps because the kidnapping outragedColombians more than any previous guerrilla undertaking.   Shortly after Gomez Hurtado was released, Barco put out acautious feeler that seemed to indicate a willingness to beginpeace talks with the rebels.   ``The government will persist in its earnest desire for peaceand will do its utmost in searching for reconciliation betweenColombians,'' he said in a statement read for him over nationwidetelevision and radio.   Early in the abduction, Gomez Hurtado was reported fatallywounded. But he said Wednesday that he was not wounded and that theonly physical problem he had during his captivity was a stomachailment.   ``I was treated well, and when I needed any medicine, it wasgiven to me without delay,'' he said.   In a communique released on week ago in Panama City, the M-19said it would release Gomez Hurtado. The communique, read by PapalNuncio Jose Sebastian Laboa, came after five hours of negotiationsin the Vatican Embassy in the Panamanian capital.   It said the decision had been made ``in the spirit of findingroutes that lead to a more equitable society, to the preservationof human rights and reconciliation among Colombians.''   Peace talks with the estimated 10,000 to 20,000 leftistguerrillas is a volatile issue in Colombia.   Army generals, business leaders and congressmen say theguerrillas tricked President Belisario Betancur with their demandsfor peace talks in 1982. The opponents say the guerrillas used thenegotiations to recuperate from severe setbacks against governmentsecurity forces.   Betancur's government negotiated a cease-fire with four of thefive leftist guerrilla groups, including the M-19, but the trucecollapsed within a year.   Barco's government has kept up contacts with one of theguerrilla groups, the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces.   Those talks have gone nowhere. Fighting between the group andgovernment security forces has been fierce since Barco took officeon Aug. 7, 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
