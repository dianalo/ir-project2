Mr. Lacayo writes thatSen. Jesse Helms's claims that &quot;former freedom fighterscontinue to be massacred and . . . political opponentscontinue to be intimidated, threatened, tortured and/orjailed without due process&quot; and that &quot;President VioletaChamorro `lacks the ability, perhaps even the will, to wrestpower away from her predecessors'&quot; are untrue. Mr. Lacayorests his case on the fact Sen. Helms has never visitedNicaragua and therefore his claims are based onmisperceptions. Mr. Lacayo even challenges Sen. Helms to goto Nicaragua to see the new Nicaragua under PresidentChamorro.   I hope Sen. Helms accepts the invitation. I have no doubtthat once he tours the country he will be absolutely clearthat it is the Sandinistas, and not President Chamorro, whocontrol the army, the police, the air force, the navy, thesecret police, the courts, most public cars, houses,factories, banks, and farms stolen and occupied by theSandinistas during their decade of squandering Nicaragua'sresources.</LP><TEXT>   I suggest Mr. Lacayo personally should give the tour,which should include the tombs of the freedom fighters killedsince President Chamorro's inauguration; the 800 businessesand thousands of farms confiscated by the Sandinistas thathave not been returned to their rightful owners despiteelectoral promises; the thousands of homes confiscated fromNicaraguan citizens from all walks of life. (PresidentChamorro has made a pact with the Sandinista leaders thatthey can keep homes they have occupied illegally for years,including million-dollar homes such as the one occupied byformer President Daniel Ortega.)   I hope Mr. Lacayo takes Sen. Helms to the Public Registryof Properties. The senator will be shocked to learn thatNicaragua is the only country in this hemisphere other thanCuba where the transfer of title to properties can occurwithout the knowledge, consent or compensation of itsrightful owners. This explains why there is no privateinvestment, domestic or foreign, in Nicaragua, and whyforeign banks are reluctant to finance projects.   The world needs to know that even though Mrs. Chamorro waselected democratically, there is no new Nicaragua under herleadership. Daniel Ortega is right when he says theSandinistas continue to rule the country from below, andsometimes, I would dare to say, from above.   Roberto J.
