The American Legislative Exchange Council, a national bipartisanorganization of state lawmakers, commissioned Price Waterhouse todo the survey to find out how much states ultimately pay bycharging higher taxes.   The survey looked at two pairs of states with pronounceddifferences in their taxes: Massachusetts and New Hampshire, andIndiana and Illinois.   It concluded that New Hampshire enjoys most of the economicbenefits in the phenomenon it calls ``cross-border activity.''   For the two Midwestern states there was more give and take,though overall, Indiana came out ahead. Indiana benefits atIllinois' expense from favorable cross-state line trade in tobaccoand gasoline; Illinois benefits in the sale of wine and liquor.   The survey was released Friday at the group's annual meetinghere, where 1,500 participants gathered from Thursday until Sunday.   The findings are no surprise, but they suggest that lawmakersneed to change their perspective when they set out to raise taxes,said economist Paul Lawrence, author of the survey report.   ``Under certain circumstances ... the borders of the states, interms of the taxpayers, are not geographic borders,'' Lawrence saidin a telephone call from an office in Springfield, Va.   ``Politicians tend not to think about neighboring states. Butwhen people in Massachusetts raise their taxes to raise revenue,people in New Hampshire end up raising money.''   The commodities surveyed were gasoline, wine and liquor, andtobacco. The years examined were 1975 to 1988.   Massachusetts has a sales tax of 5 percent; New Hampshire hasnone. In 1988, New Hampshire's excise tax on a cigarette carton was$1.70. In Massachusetts it was $2.60. New Hampshire owns all liquorwholesale and retail businesses, keeping the revenue and sellingthe alcohol at lower prices than those found in Massachusetts.   Based on these figures and others, the survey reckoned:   _ The average annual economic benefits for New Hampshire came to$22.4 million from added tax revenue; $104.2 million in addedretail sales, and 796 jobs earning $8.6 million.   _ The cost to Massachusetts was an annual loss of 13 percent ofcigarette sales and 7.2 percent of annual wine and liquor salesbecause Massachusetts residents bought those goods in New Hampshire.   In Illinois, fuel taxes came to 21 cents a gallon compared with18 cents a gallon in Indiana. The tax on wine in Illinois was anestimated $1.13 a gallon compared to $1.47 a gallon in Indiana.Liquor taxes in Illinois were $3.80 a gallon against $4.68 inIndiana. A carton of cigarettes in Illinois came with a tax of$2.72; Indiana taxes on a carton were $2.10.   Overall the boon to Indiana totaled $58.8 million in sales andexcise taxes, $311.6 million in retail sales, and 1,996 jobs paying$22.5 million.   The losses to Illinois came to $69.7 million in potential salesand excise taxes, $376.8 million in potential retail sales, and theloss of 2,949 jobs earning $31 million.</TEXT></DOC>
