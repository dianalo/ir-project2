It has been shown that both Gleason scoreand the combined category score of Gleason and the clinical stage arepredictive in determining the long-term survival in terms of cancer-relateddeaths per year. To date the authors have studied 34 patients. Two patientsare stage 1 (Gleason 2, 5), six patients are stage 2 (Gleason 5, 6),20 patients are stage 3 (Gleason 5-9), and six patients are stage 4 (Gleason6-10). The authors plotted the -log Ap/Af against both Gleason scoreand the combined category score to determine if a distinct Ap/Af ratioexists for patients who have stage 1 involvement and Gleason score lessthan 5. Updated findings are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
