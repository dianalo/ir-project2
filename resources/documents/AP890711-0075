Israel later bolstered its forces in south Lebanon with about 150soldiers in a mechanized force armed with tanks and armored cars,howitzers and surface-to-air missiles, the sources said. Troops alsosealed all four gateways linking Israel's buffer zone in southLebanon to the rest of the nation, they said.   The patrol came under fire in the Hasbaya region on the northernedge of Israel's self-declared security zone, said one securitysource on condition of anonymity.   ``The two wounded soldiers were evacuted by an Israeli helicopterunder the cover of heavy artillery barrage,'' the source said.   An army spokesman in Jerusalem said one soldier was woundedslightly, the other moderately. No casualties were reported amongthe guerrillas, whom the source would not identify.   The army fired more than 400 rounds of artillery into areas northof the zone, the heaviest barrage in years, security sources said.The barrage was aimed at areas around the towns of Hasbaya andMaidoun, they said.   The army spokesman in Jerusalem said the fighting occurred northof the security zone and came during the army's second thrustoutside of the zone in two days.   Sources in south Lebanon said, however, that the fight apparentlybroke out as the army withdrew from the first operation, a raidagainst Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem militia backed by Iran.   Israeli troops and their allies in the South Lebanon Army militiahad raided guerrilla hideouts around the village of Dellaya, threemiles north of the buffer zone, killing three guerrillas.   The three-hour raid was triggered by an attack on the zoneearlier in the day by Palestinian and leftist Lebanese guerrillas.   The Lebanese reports said the attacking guerrillas were from twoPalestinian factions, the Popular Struggle Front and the PopularFront for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Syrian SocialistNationalist Party, a leftist Lebanese militia.   Israel retained control over the 6-to-10-mile-deep buffer zone in1985, as it withdrew from Lebanon, to protect its northern borderfrom guerrilla attacks.</TEXT></DOC>
