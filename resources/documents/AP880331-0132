Democratic presidentialcontender Albert Gore Jr. criticized Jesse Jackson anew and askedwhy the other Democrats are reluctant to do the same.   The Republican Party began to close ranks behind the certainnomination of Bush in marked contrast to the disarray in theDemocratic Party. One sure sign of the inevitability of Bush'snomination is Reagan edging closer to dropping his transparent veilof neutrality.   ``We could see the president involved in some politicalactivities before the nominating convention'' in August in NewOrleans, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.   Fitzwater said a decision ``has not been finally made, althougheveryone is aware ... that the reality of the situation is suchthat the vice president is very close to having the nomination.''   The Democrats campaigned mainly in Wisconsin, with a primary onTuesday, and Gore and Michael Dukakis argued about Jackson'squalifications to be president.   Jackson was stung by Gore's contention that, among other things,he lacks the experience necessary to be president. CampaigningWednesday night in Wisconsin, he told a crowd at a church in theworking-class city of Cudahy: ``Some leaders don't hold office. Butleaders stand with the people in the hour of hardship andchallenge.''   Earlier, Jackson complained to reporters at Washington'sNational Airport that Gore's remarks constituted an attack ``morepersonal than principled.'' Gore, passing through the same airporta short while later, took issue with that, and criticized Jacksonanew.   ``I think it's ridiculous,'' the Tennessee senator said. ``He'sa major contender for the White House. Is he to be immune from anyquestioning of his position on the issues or his approach to thecampaign? ... Is there a separate standard?''   Gore and Jackson had planned to meet Wednesday, but it fellthrough. In light of Gore's comments a day earlier, Jackson said,``It's not necessary to meet at this time.''   On Tuesday in New York, Gore said Jackson had a ``complete andtotal lack'' of qualifications for the nation's highest office andcriticized his foreign policy views.   Gore ridiculed rival Dukakis, saying the Massachusettsgovernor's hesitancy to spell out differences with Jackson was``ludicrous.'' Dukakis, campaigning in Wisconsin Wednesday night,replied: ``We can discuss issues without attacking eachother...(Voters) don't want to know what Gore thinks of Jackson.''   Dukakis has been under pressure as a result of recent losses toJackson in Illinois and Michigan. But he managed to recoup with asolid 2-1 victory in Tuesday's Connecticut primary.   With that victory, the Massachusetts governor again took thelead in the national delegate race. According to the latest APcount, Dukakis had 648.55, Jackson 642.55, Gore 367.8 and Sen. PaulSimon 169.5, with 488.6 uncommitted.   Asked by reporters in Boston on Wednesday to detail thedifferences between himself and Jackson, Dukakis answeredcautiously. He mentioned disagreements over Middle East policy andsome domestic economic matters, but provided no specifics, sayinghe would discuss the matter more fully in a Wisconsin speech laterthis week.   Dukakis hinted that Jackson's lack of any experience in electiveoffice ought to be considered by voters. But he quickly moved tostress that any disagreements he had with Jackson had always been``friendly and respectful.''   That attitude got Gore's dander up.   ``Is there supposed to be some unwritten rule why Jesse Jacksoncannot be criticized, why his positions have to be just sacrosanct,and nobody can say anything about them for fear somebody will justmisinterpret what you're saying?'' he said.   Sen. Paul Simon, campaigning in Wisconsin, suggested that fearof alienating fervent Jackson supporters was keeping othercandidates from engaging in any real rough-and-tumble with him.   ``You have to be careful. You don't want to be perceived asanti-black,'' the Illinois senator said. Jackson has been gettingnearly unanimous black support in primary states, according to exitpolls.   A spokesman for Bush said if the vice president faced Jackson inthe general election, he would have ``no reluctance'' to criticizehim as warranted.   ``If Jackson is the nominee, we will feel very willing to attackhim on the issues,'' Bush spokesman Pete Teeley said. ``There willbe no reticence, there will be no reluctance.''   The vice president virtually locked up the GOP nomination whenhis principal rival, Sen. Bob Dole, left the race Tuesday. Formertelevision evangelist Pat Robertson is still formally in therunning, but has acknowledged he's not likely to come from behindat this point.   Bush has 813 delegates, according to the latest AP count, toRobertson's 17. To nominate, 1,139 delegates are needed.   With little to do but stay out of trouble, Bush sought to steerclear of Meese and his problems.   Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and Assistant AttorneyGeneral William F. Weld quit Tuesday. Justice Department sources,speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two left their jobsbecause they were concerned that Meese's continuing legaldifficulties were damaging the effectiveness and credibility of thedepartment.   Meese, however, said Wednesday he would not resign.   Bush said he was troubled by the resignations but added, ``I'mnot going to pass judgment'' on whether Meese should go.   Bush did say Meese would not hold the top law enforcement postin a Bush administration. ``It seems to me that the JusticeDepartment has to be above reproach. It is an agency that hasspecial responsibility,'' he said.   Republicans turned their attention to platform matters. Theparty opened platform hearings Wednesday in Washington, focusing onforeign policy. The next hearing is scheduled May 31 in KansasCity, Mo., and another is set in Los Angeles on June 30.</TEXT></DOC>
