The Louvre accord was signed in Paris by the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy -- also known as the Group of Seven, or G-7 nations. The agreement established undisclosed trading ranges for the dollar, backed up by periodic, coordinated central bank intervention in the currency markets. It also called for economic cooperation among the signers.    For most of this year, the Louvre accord has provided some stability for the dollar, after extremely volatile markets in 1982-86.    But tensions have surfaced in the past week, weakening the agreement, and with it some support for the dollar, in a period of mounting pressure on the U.S. currency.    Yesterday, for example, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker renewed a warning to West Germany that the U.S. may favor a lower dollar against the mark, unless German monetary policy eases. Mr. Baker, however, denied a New York Times report that the U.S. had already adopted a lower target rate for the dollar against the mark.    Earlier last week, Mr. Baker criticized West Germany for nudging up short-term interest rates. Credit tightening by West Germany runs counter to the Louvre provisions for Bonn to stimulate growth, which fits the Reagan administration's plan for reducing the U.S. trade deficit. In theory, a weaker dollar would hurt West German exports to the U.S. by making them more costly for Americans.    &quot;The G-7 can't afford to be seen by the markets as breaking up. That would send the dollar off on a wild and woolly ride,&quot; Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, says. &quot;The G-7 hasn't broken up, but they're certainly in disarray.&quot;    Mr. Baker's earlier remarks had prompted Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to speak out Friday against any tinkering with the exchange rate levels set by the Louvre agreement. At a news conference in Tokyo, he pointed out that the accord calls for the monetary powers to jointly intervene in currency markets to keep exchange rates stable.    &quot;The Japanese are more concerned about the dollar than the Germans,&quot; Mr. Kellner says, as exports to the U.S. are far more important to Japan than to West Germany. Moreover, further depreciation of the dollar would devalue the vast U.S. holdings of Japanese investors.    The West German central bank president, Karl Otto Poehl, said the short-term interest rates were raised because of concerns about inflation. The U.S. maintains that such concerns in West Germany are unfounded.    Because the Group of Seven's finance officials and their Louvre accord are widely credited with creating the most stable period for exchange rates in years, discord among the officials could bring that stability to an end.    &quot;They don't look like international statesmen anymore,&quot; Howard Kurz, a principal in Buchen, Kurz andamp; Co., a New York foreign exchange management firm, says.    Richard Witten, vice president, foreign exchange, at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., New York, says: &quot;The overriding question I have is, 'What's going on in the G-7?'&quot;    If a split is developing, he says, &quot;it's simply a reaffirmation of why countries don't have the ability to coordinate economic policies&quot; indefinitely.    Mr. Kellner says foreign exchange markets already have begun testing the cohesiveness of the Group of Seven. He cites the dollar's move below 1.80 West German marks Friday for the first time in more than six weeks. Further declines all but certainly await the U.S. currency, he says.    &quot;Analysts never thought for a moment that countries as diverse as the G-7 would ever give up their national interests for the good of the others,&quot; Mr. Kellner says.    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar crept lower against most other major currencies as fear of central bank intervention waned.    A record point decline in the U.S. stock market-the second such record drop of the week-didn't appear to have an immediate impact on exchange rates. But a reaction could come this week, traders said.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.7975 marks, compared with 1.8006 marks late Thursday. Although it also showed slight declines against most other currencies, the dollar firmed to 142.45 Japanese yen from 142.13.    The U.S. currency was squeezed upward against the yen as traders got out of positions they had taken earlier in the week involving the yen and the mark. In doing so, traders sold yen to buy dollars, then sold dollars to buy marks.    Some traders said last week's public disagreement over monetary policy between the U.S. and West Germany reduced their fears of possible coordinated central bank action to support the dollar.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $8.70 an ounce to $471.60 in heavy trading. Estimated volume was 6.9 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $475.10 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                  LATE NEW YORK TRADING                  Friday, Oct. 16, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
