<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-31-0223 </DOCNO><TEXT>The issue of who pays for certain competitively-induced excess capacitycosts has been resolved in a number of rate cases in the natural-gasand electric-utility industries. Many FERC-regulated pipelines have sustainedlarge sales losses because they have attempted to recover uncompetitivecost levels in the face of an expanding array of competitive alternativesto pipeline sales, such as transportation, conservation, and alternativefuels. In several cases in recent years, the FERC has assigned some ofthe cost of unused pipeline capacity to stockholders. At the state commissionlevel, electric and natural gas cases dealing with incentive or cogenerationdeferral industrial rate discounts have been the most frequent venuefor determining rate payer-stockholder allocations of completitively-induceduneconomic sunk costs. In most of these cases, the utility's attemptsto recover excess sunk costs have made competitive alternatives moreattractive to industrial customers, leading to actual or threatened lossof utility sales. Utilities and regulators have responded by attemptingto preserve or increase utility sales by allowing rate discounts forprice-elastic industrial customers who maintain or increase loads. 101references.</TEXT></DOC>
