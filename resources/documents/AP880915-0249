The lanky, 38-year-old head of the Securities and ExchangeCommission's enforcement division, who once drove a truck for thefamily business, leads a team of lawyers and investigators that hasstunned the financial world with the biggest crackdown onsecurities law abuse in history.   It's an effort that has made Wall Street felons Dennis Levineand Ivan Boesky household words. It has forced the most venerablebrokerages to re-evaluate and tighten their own compliance andethics codes. Moreover, it is likely to lead to tough new laws oninsider trading and other frauds.   To Lynch, a 6-foot-2 father of two young sons who works 11-hourdays and weekends for an annual salary of about $72,000, a fractionof what he'd earn in a private practice, this is the reward fortaking on the role of top SEC cop.   ``It took a couple of years for me to get to the point where Ienjoyed it,'' he said in a telephone interview Thursday from hisoffice in Washington. ``For the forseeable future I see myselfstaying right here.''   Lynch and his crew made perhaps the biggest splash of theircareers Sept. 7 with a 184-page civil complaint against DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc., its celebrity high-yield bond financierMichael Milken and other employees, accusing them of secretlyscheming with Boesky to violate a litany of securities laws andcheat Drexel's own clients.   The complaint, which marked the most aggressive SEC enforcementaction ever undertaken against an investment firm, capped a nearlytwo-year probe of Drexel, implicated by Boesky when he settledinsider trading charges with the SEC in 1986 and paid theenforcement agency a record $100 million.   Drexel has asserted its innocence and assembled a scrappy legalteam to fight the accusations, which may not be resolved for years.   In accordance with SEC policy, Lynch would not elaborate on theallegations against Drexel, which is still under investigation. Butthose who know Lynch say he's a tenacious legal adversary whoshouldn't be underestimated.   ``He's a fine individual and an outstanding lawyer. I'm proud ofhim,'' said Stanley Sporkin, a former SEC enforcement chief whohired Lynch in 1976. ``He's a very quiet, reserved person who goesabout his job and does it.''   Sporkin, now a federal judge in Washington, said Lynch impressedhim soon after joining the division by taking on a tortuouslycomplex securities law violation case involving a West Coast firmwith an aggressive defense lawyer.   ``From that point on,'' recalled Sporkin, ``I knew I could relyon him. When he told me there was something there, there wassomething there.''   Lynch grew up in rural New York, attended Syracuse Universityand graduated from Duke University Law School in 1975, but wasn'tsure he wanted to make a career out of law.   He wound up driving a truck in Florida for his brother'sbusiness before spending a year in private practice andsubsequently joining the SEC.   Quickly rising through the enforcement division, from staffattorney to branch chief to assistant director, he developed areputation as one of the shrewdest SEC lawyers around, especiallybecause of his talents at uncovering ``paper trails'' of fraud andbargaining for information.   ``I've certainly always enjoyed the investigative process,''Lynch said. ``I like putting the puzzle together. I also have tosay I like negotiating deals, even if eventually a deal's notreached.''   Lynch got the division's top job in early 1985 and became theyoungest enforcement chief in SEC history. Although some securitieslawyers say privately that Lynch happened to be in the right placeat the right time to lead the crusade against Wall Street greed,others say he was crucial to the effort.   ``Without him, this wouldn't have gotten done,'' said EdwardHerlihy, a New York attorney and a former SEC assistant enforcementchief who had been Lynch's superior in the late 1970s. ``I thinkless-able people than Gary Lynch would have stubbed their toes.''   Lynch's colleagues say he personally pierced the veil of secrecysurrounding the Bahamas branch of a Swiss bank where convictedinsider trader Dennis Levine maintained a bank account to handlehis illicit deals.   Faced with exposure, Levine cooperated with the SEC and federalprosecutors, becoming the key figure that led them to Boesky.   Softspoken and modest, with gray-flecked hair that belies hisage, Lynch also is credited with restoring sapped morale at theenforcement division, which had watched Lynch's predecessor, JohnFedders, depart amid scandal.   After Fedders' resignation, prompted by charges that he hadbeaten his wife, Lynch managed to keep many talented SEC lawyersfrom leaving for higher-paying jobs in private practice.   Lynch is not without critics in the government, however. Rep.John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House subcommittee onoversight and investigations, has chided Lynch and his staff fornot aggressively pursuing other securities law abuses besides thehighly publicized insider trading cases.   Others have criticized Lynch for allowing Boesky to settleinsider trading charges for only $100 million and permitting him tosell large positions before the charges against him were announcedin November 1986 _ in effect letting Boesky trade on insideinformation about his impending demise.   Lynch rejects such criticisms, saying that under his tenure theSEC has pursued more enforcement cases than at any other time inhistory.</TEXT></DOC>
