(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Martin Alsobrooks was hired as ananimal technician at a research laboratory here, nobody told him themonkeys he'd handle likely would carry a virus that could kill him.   Less than three months later, one of his co-workers is dead, aformer co-worker is hospitalized and Alsobrooks and about 30 currentor former colleagues are on an experimental anti-viral drug theyhope will stem the rare disease in case they, too, have beeninfected.   The herpes B virus, better known as the monkey virus, is found inmore than 50 percent of rhesus monkeys, a type of macaque. The virusis harmless to the animals, but more than half of the 30 casesdocumented in humans since the disease was first reported 57 yearsago have been fatal. It's commonly transmitted through bites andscratches.   ``I try not to worry about things I have no control over, but myfamily is worried. My mother is lighting candles,'' said Alsobrooks,33, whose blood test results were inconclusive.   Thousands of these monkeys are being used daily in laboratoryexperiments nationwide. While progress is being made in the area ofanimal welfare rights, the conditions in which lab employees workare largely unregulated by federal or state law.   Officials at International Research and Development Corp. saythey have complied strictly with guidelines set by the Centers forDisease Control in Atlanta and that the two technicians who wereinfected did not report their wounds.   Tom McGeorge, a 23-year-old technician, died June 20, just a fewdays after the virus was diagnosed. The hospitalized formeremployee, whose name is being withheld, is in serious condition. Heworked at the company only one week before quitting this spring.   Early detection was impossible since neither man reported hisinjuries, which is required by the company, said Francis X. WazeterIII, IRDC vice president.   When an employee reports being bitten or scratched by a monkey, adisinfectant is promptly applied to the wound to kill the virus,Wazeter said.   Some employees said bites and scratches were so common and thepressure to complete studies so great that it was nearly impossibleto report each wound to the company nurse.   Wazeter denied there was pressure on employees to work fast andsaid reporting wounds is mandatory. He also denied allegations byseveral employees that the leather gloves used by monkey handlers _part of the extensive protection gear _ usually had holes and tookmonths to replace.   The CDC's guidelines, which are not enforced by any regulatoryagency, were created two years ago after a herpes B outbreak inPensacola, Fla., killed two monkey handlers and infected two otherpeople.   Some current and former employees at the lab believe a highturnover rate, poor training, and heavy workloads played a part inthe outbreak of the rare disease, which has been documented only 30times since the first case was reported in 1932, said Dr. GaryHolmes, a CDC epidemiologist.   The disease, which attacks the brain and central nervous system,frequently leads to encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, andthen to death. Since the virus has been documented, 16 of the 24patients who have shown symptoms have died, Holmes said. In one casein Pensacola, the virus was spread person-to-person.   Of about 135 blood tests conducted on current and former IRDC labemployees who had contact with the monkeys in the last two months,81 were negative and five were inconclusive, Michigan Department ofPublic Health officials said. The rest of the results are expectedthis week.   The company, which employs 350 people, does animal research formedical, pharmaceutical, veterinary and agricultural companies.</TEXT></DOC>
