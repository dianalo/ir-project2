The officials met at the U.S. Coast Guard base on GovernorsIsland in New York harbor for talks that are expected to end lateTuesday or early Wednesday, said Anne Stoddard, a spokeswoman forthe U.S. Mission to the United Nations.   U.S. officials in Washington said there were some hopeful signson a timetable for a Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola as part ofa peace settlement. A peace settlement may also be linked to blackmajority rule in Namibia.   One indication is that the Soviet Union, which has providedAngola's Marxist government with billions of dollars in militaryequipment since 1975, has shown interest in ending the conflictthere through a negotiated settlement, said the officials, whospoke on condition of anonymity.   They also say Angola for the first time has accepted theprinciple of a total Cuban troop withdrawal.   But Cuba has steadily increased its troop commitment to Angolain the past six months. Close to 50,000 Cubans are believed to bestationed there, compared with 35,000 to 37,000 last fall, theofficials said.   According to the U.S. officials, Cuba probably has increased itstroop deployment to strengthen its bargaining position for thenegotiations.   The U.S. goal is to achieve a timetable for a full Cuban troopwithdrawal that would take place simultaneously with implementationof a United Nations Security Council resolution calling forindependence in neighboring Namibia, which has been administered bySouth Africa for 70 years.   Angola and Cuba thus far have said the Cuban withdrawal shouldtake place over four years, while the Namibian independence processshould be consistent with the one-year timetable specified in theU.N. resolution.   But the Reagan administration sees the four-year proposal forthe Cuban withdrawal as an opening bargaining position that issubject to change as peace talks proceed. Disagreement over atimetable for a Cuban pullback is probably the most difficultunresolved issue.   The four parties first met in London in early May and thenreconvened late last month in Cairo, Egypt. In Cairo, the partiesagreed that a statement of principles governing future negotiationswould be useful.   The U.S. delegation will be led by Assistant Secretary of StateChester Crocker, who heads the African affairs bureau and has beenworking on a southern Africa peace settlement since he joined theadministration in 1981.   The Angola civil war and the struggle for independence inNamibia are among the oldest armed conflicts in the world.   The United States is a party to the Angolan conflict because ithas been supporting an anti-communist guerrilla movement since1985. But the administration does not regard this involvement as anappropriate item for the ongoing negotiations because it believesthe talks should focus on the withdrawal of foreign forces fromthat country.   South Africa has repeatedly sent troops across the border intoAngola in support of the U.S.-backed rebel forces there. Angola'sgovernment wants the permanent withdrawal of all South Africanforces from Angola.   Shortly after the Cairo talks ended in late June, South Africantroops clashed with Cuban and Angolan forces in southwest Angolanear the Namibian border.</TEXT></DOC>
