Both companies are Vancouver, British Columbia-based mining concerns.    Granges said the stock purchase is a private placement from Hycroft's treasury of 1.2 million shares at 11.375 dollars each. Granges added it will receive warrants to buy, within a year, as many as 1.2 million more Hycroft shares at 11.625 dollars each.    If the warrants are exercised, the added stock will boost Granges's stake to 63.8%. Options and other possible Hycroft stock issues could dilute the stake to 55.3% after the private placement and to 58.5% if the warrants are exercised, Granges said.    The transactions are subject to Vancouver Stock Exchange approval. </TEXT></DOC>
