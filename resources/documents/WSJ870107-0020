Rothschild Unterberg Towbin Holdings Inc. last month have joined Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., as expected by industry sources, to head the securities firm's domestic and international technology group.    Shearson confirmed that Thomas I. Unterberg, the 56-year-old former chairman of L.F. Rothschild, will head the group, and A. Robert Towbin, 50, Rothschild's former vice chairman, will be co-head. Mr. Unterberg will also serve on the investment banking policy committee of Shearson, which is a unit of American Express Co.    Messrs. Unterberg and Towbin, along with Shearson managing director Fred Frank, also will be responsible for Shearson's venture capital investments.    Mr. Unterberg said he expects to add seven or eight investment bankers to the technology group. But he said he has &quot;no present plans&quot; to hire anyone from L.F. Rothschild, which is a securities firm.    Francois Mayer, co-chief executive of L.F. Rothschild, said his firm has &quot;certain understandings regarding the employment&quot; of L.F. Rothschild personnel by Messrs. Unterberg and Towbin. But, he said, the two parties had agreed not to divulge any details. </TEXT></DOC>
