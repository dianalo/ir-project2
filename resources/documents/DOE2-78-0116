A proposal for the functionsof such a system is made. An application based on multivariate signalanalysis methods was constructed for diagnosing priodical distrubancesin a coal-fired power plant. In the theoretical part of this work basicconcepts of knowledge engineering and the analysis method used in theprototype are introduced. The power plant process is also described inthe extent required for understanding the process models used in theprototype system. In the experimental part the functions of a diagnosissystem based on signal analysis methods are discussed in general, anda more thorough description of the prototype system is given. The modelsof the process and the control of the diagnosis in particular are discussedin detail. The operation of the diagnosis system is described as a modularstructure with a fairly general description of the functions and knowledgein each of the modules. Functions implemented in the prototype systemare discussed in more detail. The major modules of the prototype systemare the models for the structure and function of the process and themodel for controlling the diagnosis. This is because it was found thatthey describe the most important part of the knowledge needed in problemsolving. The operation of the prototype is based on the hierarchicalfunctional model of the process.</TEXT></DOC>
