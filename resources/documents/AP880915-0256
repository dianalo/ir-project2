Weiss,head of the Chicago-based Bell company whose subsidiary phonecompanies serve Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.   At a Washington news conference, Weiss said businessrestrictions placed on the Bell companies five years ago as part ofthe American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. divestiture are not servingthe public interest.   He called it unfair to prevent the companies from making theirown equipment, contending their removal from the marketplacethrough the breakup of ATandamp;T has resulted in dominance by foreignmanufacturers and a $2.6 billion trade deficit fortelecommunications equipment at the end of 1987.   Weiss said he would urge House members to pass a resolutionintroduced by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., to lift the manufacturingban and allow the regional companies to sell information servicessuch as financial planning, spreadsheet analyses and electronicdirectories provided for computers.   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene earlier this year modified theATandamp;T consent decree to allow the Bell companies to transmitinformation services, but he refused to permit them to originatethe information themselves. He said the Bell companies' control oflocal phone networks would give them an unfair advantage overinformation-services competitors.   But Weiss said, ``Supporters of the information servicesrestriction imply that the restriction is the only way to ensurefair competition. These people aren't opposed merely to unfaircompetition. They prefer no competition, period.   ``Let it be clear, however, that in their dash to protect theirmarkets, they are also keeping many critical information servicesfrom the American people and many benefits from the Americaneconomy.''</TEXT></DOC>
