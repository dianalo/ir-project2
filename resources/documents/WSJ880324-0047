Taylor (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK </IN><G> JUS </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A second former official of defunct Vernon Savings andamp; Loan Association is expected to plead guilty to a felony charge as a federal investigation of fraud in Texas thrifts gains momentum, government officials said.    Dallas-based Vernon was closed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in November at an initial cost of $1.3 billion, the costliest thrift closing to date. Bank Board officials have said the investigation of the wayward thrift has accelerated since John Smith, a former senior executive vice president of Vernon, pleaded guilty last month to filing false statements with regulators.    Government officials said the latest plea agreement, which is expected to be announced today, involves a midlevel official at Vernon, who admits obtaining sexual services for major customers of the thrift as part of a bribery scheme.    The disclosure adds spice to a story already loaded with charges of fraud and mismanagement. In a civil suit last year, the federal government has accused Vernon's officers of inflating its net worth to pay nearly $23 million in dividends, about $15 million in bonuses and assorted personal expenses, much of them to the benefit of Vernon's chief owner Don Dixon and a company he controlled.    Asked about Mr. Dixon, William Hendricks, head of the Justice Department's fraud section, said the government's inquiry into Mr. Dixon &quot;is continuing, and we are happy with the pace of the investigation.&quot;    Mr. Dixon couldn't be reached for comment. He has filed for personal bankruptcy and has taken the Fifth Amendment when questioned by government investigators.    A task force of nearly 50 federal officials is beginning to show results of more than nine months of examining Texas financial institutions. Prosecutors have filed criminal charges against five individuals since early last month. Last week, they obtained a fraud indictment of the most prominent figure charged to date, Thomas Gaubert, a former Texas Sandamp;L owner and a political ally of House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas). Mr. Gaubert has denied wrongdoing.    Federal officials say there is no sign of an end to the investigations and that, in fact, their staff may have to be increased. </TEXT></DOC>
