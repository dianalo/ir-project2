The drilling-rig count -- a closely watched barometer of the state of the U.S. oil industry -- last week broke through the 1,000 mark for the first time in nearly 17 months, Baker Hughes Inc., an oil field tools and services concern, said yesterday. And industry analysts generally agreed that after increasing 53% from last year's record low of 663, drilling activity is likely to increase further to the 1,200-rig level by year's end -- even if prices drop further.    &quot;Unless the price drop feeds on itself, we should see further recovery in drilling activity this year,&quot; said Thomas A. Petrie, Denver-based oil analyst for First Boston Corp.    Indeed, the latest increase in drilling coincides with a price decline of more than $3 a barrel in recent weeks on spot and futures oil markets, a decline caused by signs of easing tension in the militarized Persian Gulf and by reports of overproduction by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.    But the recent price weakness hasn't been as noticeable in U.S. oil fields, largely because field &quot;postings&quot; -- the price paid by refiners for a barrel of crude -- hadn't climbed as high as the more than $22 that had been reached on spot and futures markets. Following last year's price collapse, the highest posting reached for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, was $20 a barrel.    Although most major refiners yesterday reduced the prices they post for West Texas Intermediate by 50 cents a barrel, their new postings of $19.50 a barrel remain well above the $18 that most U.S. oil companies are using as a base for spending plans this year. &quot;The major impact could be on next year's budgets because, all of a sudden, OPEC's moving up to $20 a barrel from $18 isn't a cinch,&quot; said Frank Spadine, an energy economist at Bankers Trust Co.    Houston-based Baker Hughes reported yesterday that last week's U.S. rig count totaled 1,012 units, an increase of 14 from the preceding week. That was substantially above the 727 active rigs reported a year earlier but still far below the peak of more than 4,500 in December 1981.    &quot;If the West Texas Intermediate price doesn't drop below $18, we shouldn't see a change of (drilling) plans for the remainder of the year,&quot; said I. C. Kerridge Jr., Baker Hughes vice president and economist. He estimates the rig count for all year will average 940 rigs compared with 964 for 1986. Last year's average was boosted by the more than 1,900 rigs that were running at the beginning of 1986, before the oil price collapse.    The increase in drilling is particularly noticeable in the Gulf of Mexico. According to Offshore Data Services, which tracks offshore drilling world-wide, the utilization rate of the gulf fleet last week rose to 52.1%, with 121 rigs under contract, up from 49.6% the preceding week. &quot;If oil prices don't keep going down, the utilization rate should be 65% to 75% by the end of the year,&quot; said Gerald Greenberg, editor of the Offshore Rig newsletter.    But while drilling has increased, Petroleum Information Corp. reports that oil and gas wells completed in this year's first seven months totaled only 12,856, sharply below the 19,990 completed in the year-earlier period. &quot;Well completions should accelerate through the end of this year, but we don't expect they will exceed last year's total of 37,500,&quot; Jack Ekstrom, a Petroleum Information spokesman, said. Also, he noted that the percentage of exploratory wells included in new well permits is dropping, suggesting that oil companies are concentrating their resources on developing existing fields rather than finding new ones.    Since the price of West Texas Intermediate stabilized at more than $18 a barrel this year, several oil companies have increased their 1987 spending plans from previously budgeted levels. Houston-based Mitchell Energy andamp; Development Corp. currently plans capital spending of $106 million for its fiscal year ending next Feb. 1, $10 million higher than budgeted earlier. New Orleans-based Louisiana Land andamp; Exploration Co. has revised its 1987 capital spending upward to $150 million from the previously budgeted $135 million. Even if prices should fall further from the current level, Louisiana Land &quot;is committed to the $150 million,&quot; a company official said.    Most major oil companies are expected to spend more on domestic activities in the second half than in the first half. Some are looking at upward revisions in their budgets. But most spent less than their budgets for the first half and thus have money to spare for second-half spending. Running counter to the trend is Radnor, Pa.-based Sun Co., which said it has reduced its 1987 capital spending plans to $871 million from the previously budgeted $925 million. But unlike most companies, Sun had based its initial budget on a higher oil price of around $18 a barrel for the year. Most other companies used a range of $15 to $17.    &quot;It will be the first time in several years we will be under $1 billion,&quot; a spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
