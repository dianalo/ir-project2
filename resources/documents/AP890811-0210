The drop last month in the Labor Department's Producer PriceIndex followed a 0.1 percent dip in June as the wholesale inflationgauge registered its first back-to-back monthly declines sinceearly 1986.   The July improvement was even better than expected and bolsteredthe arguments of economists that inflation will be well behaved inthe second half of the year, giving the Federal Reserve more roomto lower interest rates in an effort to keep the economy out of arecession.   In more good economic news, the government reported today thatretail sales, bolstered by an upturn in auto spending, shot up 0.9percent in July, the biggest advance in three months, withrevisions to May and June sales showing significantly more strengththan believed earlier.   ``These data suggest the economy continues to sustain modestgrowth with low inflation. We're on a sound economic course.Unemployment is the lowest in more than a decade, inflation isgoing down, growth is steady'' and the stock market rallying, saidpresidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.   ``We have the best of both worlds, no inflation and increasingconsumer spending,'' said Dirk Van Dongen, president of theNational Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. ``Those are verygood vital signs for the economy.''   The news on inflation was particularly welcome because it cameafter a surge in prices earlier in the year had triggered fearsthat the country could be on the verge of another inflationaryspiral.   Even with the back-to-back declines, wholesale inflation throughthe first half of 1989 rose at an annual rate of 5.7 percent,compared to last year's 4 percent rise.   But the acceleration in prices had been caused by higher energyand food costs. With both areas showing moderation now, economistsare looking for inflation to slow substantially in the last half ofthe year.   The 0.4 percent July drop in wholesale prices reflected thesecond monthly drop in gasoline prices, which fell 7.2 percentafter declining 4 percent in June.   Another favorable price development came from a 1.9 percentdecline in new car prices. Labor Department analysts said thisdecrease reflected earlier-than-usual end-of-the-model-yeardiscounting by automakers trying to clear out a large inventory ofunsold cars.   Food costs, which had fallen a giant 0.8 percent in June, edgedup by 0.1 percent in July.   Inflation excluding the food and energy categories fell as wellin July, dropping 0.2 percent. Because food and energy prices varywidely from month to month, economists look to the inflation rateof other goods as an indication of underlying inflationarypressures.   The slight increase in food costs was attributed to a 2.5percent rise in beef prices, which had fallen in June.   Prices also turned up after June declines for fish, pasta, softdrinks, coffee and rice.   Fresh fruit prices continued to rise, climbing 1.3 percent inJuly after a 1.4 percent jump a month earlier. Vegetable costs,however, took another big drop, falling 9 percent after an 8percent June decline.   The gasoline price decline helped to mask an increase of 1.5percent in the cost of natural gas and a 0.3 percent rise in homeheating oil costs.   The overall 0.4 percent July decline in the Producer Price Indexfor finished goods one stop short of retail was the biggestone-month drop since a 0.8 percent fall in July 1986.   The June-July drops marked the first consecutive monthlydeclines since a four-month period of falling wholesale prices fromJanuary through April in 1986.   The improvement in July left the Producer Price Index at 114.0,meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 in 1982would have cost $114.00 last month.   Economists worried at the beginning of the year that higher foodand energy costs were threatening to become imbedded in permanentlyhigher inflation rates as workers demanded higher wage increases tomake up for the ground lost to rising prices.   That was a top concern at the Federal Reserve, which beganmoving in March 1988 to push interest rates up in an effort todampen inflationary pressures.   The Fed's goal was to slow economic growth enough to allowinflation to moderate without pushing the country into a recession.   In early June of this year, the central bank switched coursefrom worrying about inflation to worrying about an economic slumpand conducted three modest moves since that time to lower interestrates.   Many economists are looking for further credit easing on thepart of the Fed as the economy sends out further signals thatinflation is slowing.   Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at GeorgiaState University, said he expected wholesale prices would rise 5.1percent this year, compared with an increase of 4 percent in 1988.   However, in the first six months of the year, wholesale priceswere rising at an annual rate of 7.6 percent. Ratajczak said heexpected prices would moderate significantly to an annual rate ofless than 3 percent in the last six months of 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
