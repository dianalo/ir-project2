Sorting through the tangle of fourth-quarter charges andadjustments, however, won't be easy. Most of the companiesare expected to take one-time charges -- just as they did ayear earlier. &quot;Results will have no bearing on reality,&quot; saidJack Grubman, telecommunications analyst for PaineWebber Inc.&quot;And on an operating basis, we're looking at only so-socomparisons.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   That also will hold true for this year. Mainly because ofthe recession, analysts generally see earnings and dividendsgrowing only a few percentage points in 1992 despitewidespread work-force reductions and cost-cutting programs.Beyond that, the Baby Bells' phone units will come underpressure from new competitors.   Before the recent round of charges and adjustments wereannounced, analysts predicted Ameritech's fourth-quarterearnings would be about $1.21 a share; Bell Atlantic Corp.,81 cents; BellSouth Corp., 82 cents; Nynex Corp., $1.48;Southwestern Bell Corp., $1.07; Pacific Telesis, 67 cents; US West Inc., 72 cents, and GTE, 55 cents. Because of creditsand adjustments, many of the actual numbers won't match up.   &quot;The overall economy remains sluggish, and demand fortelephone services hasn't shown much of an improvement,&quot; saidRobert B. Morris III, of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. With loomingcompetition putting downward pressure on rates, phonecompanies will have to cut costs even more. &quot;But for theunregulated businesses {primarily cellular phone service anddirectory publishing}, we see little earnings growth,&quot; hesaid. Moreover, several companies, including Ameritech Corp.,Bell Atlantic and BellSouth, have made acquisitions that willtake a bite out of 1992 earnings.   The picture is somewhat brighter for GTE Corp., which hasrefocused tightly on telecommunications services, buyingContel Corp., streamlining its phone-company units andgradually withdrawing from telecommunications equipmentmanufacturing. GTE also announced it is leaving the highlycompetitive long-distance business, selling its 19.9%interest in US Sprint to United Telecommunications.   Daniel Reingold, telecommunications analyst for MorganStanley andamp; Co., predicts &quot;the best performances will be byGTE, Pacific Telesis Group and Southwestern Bell.&quot; The twoBells, he says, are bolstered by cellular operations andforeign ventures, including Southwestern's investment inTelmex, the Mexican phone company, and Pacific Telesis'scellular operations in Germany.   The Baby Bells generally see better times ahead.   Raymond Smith, Bell Atlantic's chairman and chiefexecutive officer, said in an interview that the companycould return to 6% to 9% per-share earnings growth in a yearor so -- assuming an upturn in the economy. Perhaps a yearlater, the company expects to be at the top of that range, hesaid. Leading the way will be cellular and foreign operationsas well as a wide range of new phone services.   Over the next few years, Bell Atlantic anticipates reapingthe benefits of a multibillion dollar network upgradeprogram. The digital technology and sophisticated switchingcapabilities have led to such services as calleridentification and call answering, which are projected to add$600 million in revenue by 1995 or 1996, Mr. Smith said. Newinformation services, including video services, could total$300 million over the same period. One such service that isscheduled for testing this year delivers a VCR-qualitypicture over regular telephone lines.   Like other Bell executives, David Brenner, vice presidentand controller of U S West, sees a more favorable regulatoryenvironment emerging since phone companies already haveabsorbed a round of rate cuts from state regulators inexchange for more pricing flexibility. Mr. Brenner alsopointed out that U S West's 14-state region is faring betterin this recession than the rest of the country. As a result,access line growth will be about 3% in 1992, about the sameas last year. That is on the high end of U S West'sperformance since the 1984 Bell System breakup, he said.   But a host of fourth-quarter charges are guaranteed toobscure results. The Bells have been getting in shape forfuture competition -- perhaps from wireless systems and cabletelevision companies -- by shrinking their payrolls andleaving unfruitful ventures. Many of the charges are hefty. US West, Denver, for example, said it will take a charge ofabout $590 million, or $1.47 a share, for work-forcereductions, sales of its real estate portfolio and thewrite-off of certain intangible assets. And Nynex, based inWhite Plains, N.Y., is taking a $550 million charge, or $2.73a share, tied to employee reduction programs and businessrestructuring.   In the Midwest, Ameritech announced a $140 million charge,or 53 cents a share, mostly for work-force cuts and awritedown of certain assets and intangibles of itsunregulated business. Pacific Telesis, San Francisco, said itwill take a one-time charge of about $120 million, or 30cents, to cover costs of work-force reductions through 1994.   For the latest quarter, Bell Atlantic says a19-cent-a-share gain on its portion of Telecom Corp. of NewZealand sold last year, will be more than offset by one-timecharges. In addition, the company expects the consolidationof Metro Mobile operations to reduce earnings through 1992.The company also will be restating earnings for the firstthree quarters of 1991.   Bell Atlantic along with many other corporations bit thebullet on retirees' health-benefit liabilities. It decided toadopt new accounting rules, wiping out 1991 profits with afirst-quarter charge of $1.55 billion, or $3.93 a share.   Over the next few years, the picture could remain cloudyas competition takes hold. &quot;As their basic business comesunder pressure, you will see the companies trying todiversify their income streams,&quot; slicing into earnings,predicts Mr. Morris.   With the exception of GTE, with a service territory thatis less urban and more geographically diverse than the Bells,the group is generally out of favor with analysts. &quot;There area lot of irons in the fire,&quot; says Mr. Grubman, thePaineWebber analyst, &quot;and any one can burn the Bellsseverely.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
