(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republican presidential candidatePat Robertson on Tuesday cited second-hand testimony from a Senatesubcommittee hearing 21 years ago as documentation that Sovietintermediate-range missiles are based in Cuba.   However, several U.S. officials said Tuesday the Cuban militaryhas some surface-to-surface missiles in its inventory, but none hasa nuclear warhead and none could reach the United States even ifthey did.   The former religious broadcaster said the information indicatesa ``loophole'' in the U.S.-Soviet arms control treaty awaitingratification in the Senate.   Robertson quoted 1967 testimony by Paul Bethel, a StateDepartment official from Miami who said Cuban refugees had told himof seeing missiles, and one of the refugees, identified only as Mr.Apud, who swore Cuban soldiers let him know about missiles aimed atWashington before he left in 1966.   Neither man testified he had personally seen the missiles, thetranscript indicates.   The testimony was given to the Judiciary subcommittee toinvestigate the administration of the Internal Security Act andother internal security laws. Robertson read portions of it tosupporters at a breakfast here and during a rally the night beforein Miami.   ``I've been accused of bringing funny facts,'' Robertson toldthe Fort Lauderdale gathering. ``Ladies and gentlemen, the cleareyewitness, sworn testimony of witnesses before a Senate Judiciarycommittee is not funny facts. ... This is documented evidence.''   Robertson's assertion that there are missiles based in Cuba hasbeen denied by the White House, congressional defense experts andCuban president Fidel Castro.   Several defense and administration officials were asked Tuesdayabout Robertson's claim. The officials, speaking on condition ofanonymity because they did not want to become involved in thepresidential race, said Cuba has about five dozen Frog-4 and Frog-7battlefield missiles, date to the 1960s.   The Frog-7, when originally introduced by the Soviets, couldcarry either a conventional or nuclear warhead, ``but we'reconfident no nuclear warheads ever went to Cuba for that missileand it doesn't have any range anyway,'' said one source whorequested anonymity.   According to the reference book ``Jane's Weapon Systems,'' theFrog-7 has a range of only about 43 miles _ or half the distancebetween Cuba and Florida. Moreover, the rocket has no guidancesystem to direct it to a specific target.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said last month that Cubahas been under extensive surveillance since the 1962 missile crisisand there was ``no evidence'' any other nuclear weaponry had everbeen deployed there by the Soviet Union.   Robertson concentrated heavily on the Cuban-American vote forthe March 8 Super Tuesday primary during a two-day swing throughSouth Florida.   The Miami rally drew little more than half of the 1,500 peoplethat campaign organizers had predicted in a show of the candidate'sstrength among Hispanics.   At a news conference following the breakfast, Robertson refusedto say how he obtained the missile testimony transcript.   ``How I got it is my business, but the thing that's important isthat it's available in the records of the United Stategovernment,'' he said. ``And, frankly, I think it shows that thestaff work by the State Department was not adequate on the INFtreaty because there's clearly a Cuban loophole.''   A Cuban refugee who claims he saw a variety of missiles,including long-range surface-to-surface missiles, there as late as1985 said he met Thursday in Miami with Robertson.   Copies of a Spanish-language newspaper, Diario Libre, with aheadline proclaiming ``YES, PAT! YOU'RE RIGHT!'' and maps drawn bythe refugee to pinpoint the missile sites were distributed tocampaign supporters throughout his South Florida visit.   The man identified himself only as E. Rodriguez, saying hefeared revealing his full name would result in retribution againstfamily members still in Cuba. He said he was an agriculturalplanner and had access to aerial photographs and to areas of Cubawhere the missiles were based.   Robertson said he couldn't vouch for the authenticity of thenewspaper's account of the refugee's story.   ``I'm not saying I have other than this proof,'' he said,referring to the subcommittee transcript. ``It's coming to me frommany, many people now, people who are aware of it.   ``But the issue is not can we prove or can we not prove. Theissue is verification We have a treaty. There's a loophole in thetreaty. We must put in verification of the Cuban missile sites.''   He told reporters the only way to verify his claim was topersonally go to Cuba and look for the missiles. But, responding toa question, he said he would decline an invitation to do so shouldit be extended by Castro, who he has described as ``a butcher and atyrant.''   In the subcommittee transcript, Apud said he was told by Cubansoldiers he had known for many years that the missiles werenicknamed ``Washington Left,'' ``Washington Right,'' and``Washington Central.''   Robertson quoted Bethel's acknowledgement, in response toquestioning by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., that numerous refugeeshad told him they had seen missiles left in Cuba after the CubanMissile Crisis and new ones constructed in 1964.   Bethel testified he could not state with certainty thatintermediate or intercontinental ballistic missiles were in Cuba,but that the State Department also couldn't be certain they weren'tthere.</TEXT></DOC>
