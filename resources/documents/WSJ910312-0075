Also complicating the meeting is the apparent frictionbetween Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, and SadekBoussena, Algeria's oil minister and the president of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Their disputestems from differing political views concerning the waragainst Iraq. Iraq isn't represented by a delegation at thismeeting.</LP><TEXT>   As a sign of the seriousness of the dispute, Mr. Boussenasent Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister, tomake the customary initial visit to Mr. Nazer instead ofgoing himself.   But late last night, OPEC's Secretary-General Subrotoattempted to strike a moderate tone, saying some of the toughstances being espoused by various OPEC members at thismeeting of the ministerial monitoring committee appeared tobe mellowing. &quot;The tone is more cordial, and the ministersare more willing to talk,&quot; than they initially were, he said.   Although there was no agreement on how production cutsshould be made, a consensus seemed to be developing that somereduction in OPEC's total output, currently 23 millionbarrels a day, could be made acceptable to Saudi Arabia. Themajor obstacle to any return to the output quotas scrappedafter the Persian Gulf crisis began has been Saudi Arabia,which continues to insist the crisis isn't over.   Late last night, the ministers continued talks on apossible formula that might be acceptable to the OPEClinchpin producer. &quot;Most likely, they will come up with avoluntary arrangement to reduce production by one millionbarrels a day until June,&quot; said one individual familiar withSaudi oil policies.   Finding a resolution to the differences is crucial. Atstake is the image of OPEC itself. With a war involving fiveof its 13 members just ended, energy strategists are nowquestioning how viable OPEC is as an organization.   Also at stake is the price of petroleum. &quot;If they don'treach an agreement now, there will be a negative impact onthe market, and you will see a drop of several dollars abarrel in the price of oil,&quot; said Ahmed Zaki Yamani, theformer Saudi Arabian oil minister.   OPEC oil is now priced at $17.72 a barrel, based on anaverage of seven crudes used as a pricing measurement.Yesterday, oil prices elsewhere fell. On the New YorkMercantile Exchange, the April crude oil futures contractdeclined 32 cents a barrel to close at $18.99. April gasolinecontinued strong, however, adding 1.43 cents a gallon to endthe session at 71.41 cents.   Various new production ceilings being discussed early onby the oil ministers ranged from 20 million to 22 millionbarrels a day. By late yesterday, those figures appeared tohave increased to a range from 21 million to 22.5 millionbarrels a day. OPEC's own economists predict demand for OPECoil including adjustments for world oil inventories willtotal only 21.4 million barrels daily during the period ofApril through June.   OPEC strategists have been looking to Iran to step in witha proposal that might resolve a possible production fracas.With Iraq and Kuwait removed from the power structure, atleast for now, &quot;Iran is practically the only OPEC member withenough stature left to stand up to the Saudis,&quot; noted oneOPEC delegate.   And indeed, the Iranians might be willing to step in andbroker an agreement if given the right signal, one Iraniandelegate said. He said an accord could be struck on aninformal basis that wouldn't require ministers to upgrade thestatus of the meeting. The Saudis have been resisting thenotion that this monitoring committee meeting be turned intoan official conference of the ministers.   Despite the informality of such a pact, quotas wouldlikely be assigned. But, the Iranian delegate stressed, theagreement would only be temporary. At the official meeting ofOPEC ministers in June, a new arrangement could benegotiated.   OPEC observers said also that the Venezuelan delegationhas been active in trying to mediate a production arrangementthat would be satisfactory to the Algerians as well as theSaudis.   The Saudis still think any structured formula forproduction cutbacks is premature. For one thing, theyestimate demand in the second quarter for OPEC oil will bemuch higher than most other forecasts. Still, it can beassumed they don't want this meeting to collapse, sending avery bearish signal to oil markets.   What the Saudis had really wanted to accomplish at thisgathering, some OPEC observers suggested, is to startlobbying for a new set of ground rules in which the kingdomwould claim a new and higher quota to correspond with itsvastly expanded capacity.   It is understood that the Saudis will not accept a newproduction quota of less than 7.5 million to 7.8 millionbarrels a day. The kingdom is currently producing 8.4 millionbarrels a day, three million higher than its former OPECquota.</TEXT></DOC>
