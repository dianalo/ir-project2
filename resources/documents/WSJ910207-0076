MCI's program, announced two days after President Bush'snew budget, is bound to raise concerns among agencies andlawmakers that the federal government might be paying morefor certain long-distance services than big corporations.</LP><TEXT>   MCI figures it could save government agencies as much as40% on their long-distance bills for voice and data services,including those for FTS-2000.   The program, called Government TelecommunicationsServices, is based on a flat per-minute charge. It is MCI'slatest drive to win a greater share of the $2.5 billionfederal market for telecommunications services. Analysts saidit could help MCI win customers, particularly among agenciesthat aren't required to use the FTS system, while pressuringAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and US SprintCommunications Co. to lower prices -- and shave theirmargins. Two years ago, the bidding for the 10-year FTS-2000contract went to ATandamp;T, which won 60% of the work, and UnitedTelecommunications' US Sprint unit, which won 40%.   Greg Cline of IDG Inc.'s Information Strategies Group saidMCI &quot;is basically trying to stir up the FTS-2000 pot. But itcould backfire because the subtle implication is that thefolks at General Services Administration haven't done such agood job&quot; overseeing the FTS-2000 contract. MCI, Mr. Clinesaid, appears to be trying to &quot;open a pathway&quot; to be allowedto compete for the FTS-2000 contract when it comes up forrebidding in two years.   Daniel Akerson, MCI executive vice president, raised thequestion of whether &quot;the government pays high prices so thatATandamp;T and Sprint can offer lower prices in the commercialmarketplace.&quot; He said ATandamp;T's and Sprint's FTS-2000 prices forvarious voice services are 11% to 112% higher than the MCIproposal. &quot;This isn't some funny number,&quot; he added. &quot;It isn'tan apples-to-oranges comparison.&quot;   Competitors were quick to disagree. &quot;This isapples-to-spam,&quot; said Gary Forsee, president of Sprint'sbusiness services group. &quot;It is another attempt by MCI tocause confusion among agencies or undermine a successfulprogram.&quot; Sprint, he said, &quot;can't make any sense out of thepricing they presented.&quot; Moreover, Mr. Forsee said, the GSAmonitors FTS-2000 prices to ensure they don't exceed pricesoffered to big commercial customers.   The GSA hadn't seen the MCI rate filing and had noimmediate comment.   Dennis Roth, an ATandamp;T vice president, said a hasty analysisof MCI's rate filing with regulators indicated MCI rates insome cases exceeded ATandamp;T's by 20%.   FTS-2000 accounts for only about $500 million of thegovernment's $2.5 billion annual telecommunicationsexpenditures, Mr. Akerson said. He said MCI today will beginadvertising in publications distributed among agencies and onCapitol Hill.</TEXT></DOC>
