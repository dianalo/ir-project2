While applauding the troop withdrawal as ``a new chapter in thehistory of Afghanistan,'' Bush rejected a Kremlin call for animmediate cease-fire and arms embargo.   Answering questions from a group of reporters in the Oval Office,he said he was afraid rebels opposing the Soviet-backed Kabulgovernment would be left in a disadvantageous position if U.S.assistance stopped.   Just hours before Bush talked to reporters, the second-rankingofficial at the Soviet Embassy in Washington had reiterated theKremlin's call for a cease-fire.   Minister-Counselor Yevgeny Kutovoy said that a comprehensivesettlement of the strife in Afghanistan depends for the most part on``a broadly based government with the participation of all warringparties and without outside interference.''   Bush demanded the Soviets stay out of Afghan affairs.   ``The Soviet Union has nothing to fear from the establishment ofan independent, non-aligned Afghanistan,'' he said in a writtenstatement. ``At the same time, the U.S.S.R. bears a specialresponsibility for healing the wounds of this war, and we call uponit to support generously international efforts to rebuildAfghanistan.''   Bush's comments came a day after the final pullout of Red Armyforces from Afghanistan after a nine-year occupation.   Bush said he could not endorse the cease-fire and arms embargoproposal because he was concerned Soviet forces may have stockpiledweapons for the Marxist government in Kabul.   ``It would not be fair to have a tremendous amount of lethalsupplies left behind and then cut off support for the resistance andthus leave an uacceptable imbalance,'' he said.   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said there has beenmassive stockpiling by the Soviets in recent months. Suppliesprovided to the Kabul regime include numerous fighter aircraft andhelicopters, dozens of medium tanks, infantry fighting vehicles,armored personnel carriers, more than 200 howitzers and scores ofother artillery pieces and hundreds of transport vehicles.   ``In the final days of the withdrawal, they left behind even moremilitary equipment, including tanks, APCs and multiple rocketlaunchers,'' he said.   Bush said the U.S. commitment to the Afghan people ``will remainfirm, both through our bilateral humanitarian program and throughthe United Nations' efforts to remove the mines and resettle therefugees and help reconstruct the war-torn economy.''   There are widespread fears that a struggle for control bycompeting guerrilla groups could throw Afghanistan into a civil war.   ``The time for recrimination is over,'' Bush said. ``The time forbloodbaths is over and I would like to see the various factions gettogether and come up with recommendations that would lead to apeaceful Afghanistan with no more bloodbaths.''   During the Soviet Embassy news conference, Kutovoy said, ``Thequestion at stake at the present time is this: either restoration ofpeace on the Afghan soil or continuation of senseless bloodshed.''   ``The issues of humanitarian and economic assistance toAfghanistan are of ever-growing significance at this crucialstage,'' he said.   But the Soviet official also said, ``When certain elements of theAfghan opposition are trying to intensify pressure on the currentAfghan government, resorting to barbaric methods and to alldifferent kinds of diversions, to the blockade of Afghan cities,they are trying to prevent the civilian population from getting foodand consumer goods.''   ``It is our first belief that all the states should do their bestto preserve Afghanistan as a sovereign, neutral and non-alignedstate,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
