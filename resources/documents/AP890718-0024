Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., is expressing optimism that anger overdecisions by top Interior Department officials is strong enough topush through a measure that was not considered by the Senate lastyear.   ``Individual senators have contacted me concerned about theundermining of park professionals,'' he said.   The House, by voice vote, approved legislation Monday that wouldgive the head of the National Park Service a fixed term and make theperson answerable directly to Congress.   Vento, chairman of the House Interior subcommittee on nationalparks and public lands, said the measure would give more power toprofessional park employees who have been ``harassed, intimidatedand drummed out of the service'' by administration policies.   Supporters said environmental concerns were being swept aside bybusinesses interested in using the parks for commercial development.   Rep. Peter Kostmayer, D-Pa., told of the Reagan administration'sapproval Jan. 19 of ski lift construction over the Appalachian Trailin Vermont that was opposed by the Interior Department's careerstaff.   He said the career staff's opposition was reversed when theproposal reached the top political appointees in Washington.   ``Special interests have been better represented than the assetsof the parks,'' Vento said. ``The way they do that is by suppressingthe professionals.''   The legislation would require the president to nominate a parkservice director who would be confirmed by the Senate for afive-year term that could not be terminated except for just cause.   The interior secretary would relinquish power over the parks,including hiring of personnel, keeping only the power over thebudget and cabinet policy authority.   The Park Service director now is appointed by the president andis not subject to Senate confirmation.   Opponents of the bill, led by Rep. John Rhodes, R-Ariz., triedunsuccessfully to change the measure. They say President Bush willveto the bill if it passes unchanged in the Senate.   Although the bill was approved by voice vote, the key vote cameon Rhodes' amendment that would have eliminated all provisions ofthe bill except the one requiring the director to be confirmed bythe Senate. It failed 148-251.   Although that margin was wide, supporters of the bill would haveto get more votes to override a presidential veto.   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan told the House Interior Committeethis year he would recommend a veto if the bill passed in itspresent form, according to department spokesman Tom Wilson.   Steve Whitney, of the Wilderness Society, which pushed for thelegislation, emphasized the environmental damage that could occurwhen the professionals are ignored.   He said the interior secretary's office last year decided toallow oil and gas exploration in the Florida's Big Cypress NationalPreserve, despite the objections of all the professionals in thedepartment.   ``This is the Everglades,'' said Whitney. ``It is extraordinarilybiologically rich and fragile.''   He said the Wilderness Society sued to stop the exploration,which would have required extensive use of explosives. The day ajudge was to hear arguments for an injunction, two weeks afterexploration work began, the Interior Department stopped the project.</TEXT></DOC>
