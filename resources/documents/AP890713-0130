A Soviet delegate saidit contained nothing new.   In Moscow, the Kremlin welcomed the effort to speed negotiationsand said a deal might be possible within six months.   ``We have no intention of delaying this important matter ofreducing the level of military confrontation,'' said ForeignMinistry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov. He added, however, that itmight be difficult to meet a Bush administration proposal to makethe actual cuts by 1992.   He said the NATO ideas, in general, ``are viewed by us as seriousand constructive proposals, meeting our own proposals halfway.''   Negotiators for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization offeredthe proposal on the last day of second-round talks on reducingconventional forces, giving the Warsaw Pact an eight-week recess tostudy it.   This provided ``further evidence of ... our desire to achieveearly results,'' Michael Edes, head of the British delegation, tolda news conference on behalf of the Western alliance.   Oleg A. Grinevsky, head of the Soviet delegation, said agreementby 1990 ``seems quite possible ... if all sides are agreeable.''   He welcomed the NATO plan, but said he was ``sorry'' it did notgo further.   ``At first glance the proposal tabled by NATO today has no newelements,'' Grinevsky said. ``Rather, it is a more detailedelaboration of the positions that were stated in Brussels, and onlyin respect of aviation and helicopters at that.''   The Western suggestion is based on a blueprint for deepreductions in conventional forces in Europe presented by PresidentBush at the NATO summit in May and endorsed by the alliance.   Including combat aircraft and helicopters met a longstandingdemand of the Warsaw Pact.   Edes said the West initially opposed including aircraft becausetheir mobility posed verification problems in a zone stretching fromthe Atlantic to the Ural mountains.   Because of NATO's concession on the point, he said, its``political will to achieve agreement can't be doubted.''   Bush's proposal in Brussels would put a ceiling on U.S. andSoviet troops in the reduction zone of 275,000 each. NATO said thatwould mean removal of 30,000 American soldiers and a cut by theSoviet Union of 325,000.   It also called for deep cuts in armaments, with equal limits ontanks, personnel carriers and artillery.   The proposal submitted Thursday also includes limits on thenumber of combat aircraft and helicopters, and provides fordestruction of equipment withdrawn. Edes said destroying thehardware was a new element and would require detailed verficationprocedures.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III revealed the figures tojournalists Wednesday in Budapest. NATO proposes equal ceilings of5,700 on combat aircraft and 1,900 on combat helicopters. Accordingto NATO, the Warsaw Pact has about 9,600 combat aircraft and theWestern alliance about 6,700.   Edes said the new levels would ``adequately safeguard defensiveneeds of either side.''   Western delegates would not give the precise numbers of variousarmaments that would have to be removed from Europe.   ``Precise figures will emerge in the course of negotiations,''Edes said. ``The numbers game is not very fruitful at this stage.''   Accompanying the Western proposal were definitions of types ofNATO aircraft included in the proposal.   Stephen J. Ledogar, the chief U.S. delegate, said NATO wantedcomparisons on the basis of aircraft capabilities, which he called a``look alike, count alike'' policy.   Grinevsky criticized the NATO idea of reducing all combataircraft. He said the suggestion that defensive systems be includedwas ``totally at odds'' with an agreement that first-stage reductioncover only offensive armaments.   Asked about Western concern that defensive aircraft could bemodified for strike capability, he said the Soviet Union would be``ready to invite inspectors'' and even to have ``permanentinspector teams to verify that there is no cheating.''   The Warsaw Pact has a proposal on the table to reduce six kindsof weapons 10 percent to 15 percent by 1994, with a further 25percent reduction by 1997 and a move to purely defensive forcesthree years later.   Grinevsky complained about the lack of verification procedures inthe NATO proposal. Western delegates said measures on verificationand related issues remained to be worked out.   Ledogar said NATO ``will will be working hard ... to have thefull proposal on the table at the next round,'' scheduled to beginSept. 7. He called Bush's original one-year timetable for anagreement ``perfectly realistic.''</TEXT></DOC>
