ONE OF the comments I commonly hear fromusers is that they want one and only one version of Unix.andP;  They arefrustrated at the bcikering between the Open Software Foundation (OSF) andUnix International.andP;  They want the two to merge and get on with the task ofachieving one standard version of Unix that all will agree upon for thefuture.andP;  In theory, this would work, but, in reality, such a move wouldstifle creativity.andP;  Even if creativity could be maintained, the process ofsatisfying every application requirement with one large operating systemwould overwhelm the industry.andP;  In this fast-paced industry, there just isn'tenough time.andP;  And even if it could be achieved, would it be healthy?andM;Just look at the Posix specification for a clue to the answer.andP;  Posix wouldserve as that common interface between applications and operating systems.andO;But, though the Posix process is open and publicly accessible, it ispainfully slow.andP;  Those looking to Posix to solve the industry's problems arebecoming disillusioned.andP;  The definition of what should be included in Posixcontinues to expand.andP;  What started out as a single committee has grown intoat least 23 different committees, each intent on solving another part of thecomputing puzzle.andP;  To the IEEE's credit, two of the key components of Posixhave been ratified--the system interface specification (1003.1) and the usershell specification (1003.2).andP;  These two specifications will help ensureconsistency at the API level.andM;However, the two specifications only take care of base operating systemtechnology; they do not anticipate new functionality.andP;  Therefore, the abilityto provide innovation becomes an issue.andP;  Now, no one would ever admit tobeing against innovation.andP;  But if users in this industry demand oneimplementation of an operating system, then innovation must take a back seat.andO;Here's why.andP;  Let's say two systems vendors, Vendor A and Vendor B, have bothadopted a standard version of an operating system.andP;  As long as Vendor A andVendor B develop the same technology that both have used for the past severalyears (relational databases, word processing, accounting systems, etc.),andO;everything is fine.andP;  But what happens when Vendors A introduces fullsymmetric multiprocessing--which has not yet found its way into this openoperating system?andP;  And what if Vendor B develops a more sophisticated way ofhandling online transaction processing?andP;  These vendors have two choices:Either they add extensions to the open operating system, which will make eachof their versions incompatible at certain levels with other implementations,or they wait until their advances can be incorporated into the open standardvia the open process.andM;Users would be unhappy if all vendors waited until new technologies filteredthrough the opean process.andP;  It would mean that vendors not committed to theopen process could produce state-of-the-art software that users need.andO;Ironically, this would mean that proprietary would be the place to go forinnovation.andM;Yes, it is important for users to pressure vendors and standards-orientedorganizations to provide as many base-level standards as they need to makeporting and interoperability easier.andP;  But the last thing the open systemsmovement needs is another operating system like DOS.andP;  Yes, there was, by andlarge, a single operating system, and it was easy to provide shrink-wrapped,off-the-shelf applications.andP;  But when a new generation of applications wasneeded, the industry was faced with the prospect of moving to a brand new,complex operating system.andP;  Those clamoring for one standard operating systemmust think carefully--they might get just what they ask for.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
