The battle over the environmental rules is the first underPresident Bush's 90-day moratorium on regulation. VicePresident Quayle told a group of business lobbyists yesterdaythat the administration was sending a message to&quot;overzealous&quot; regulators. &quot;You have met the enemy,&quot; the vicepresident said. &quot;It's called the Competitiveness Council.&quot;Mr. Quayle heads the council.</LP><TEXT>   Administration officials said the council, as well asother White House regulatory officials, are preventing theEPA from releasing rules that would establish an expandedsystem of reporting releases of air pollutants. Under theplan, a wide range of companies -- including manufacturers,oil refineries and dry cleaners and bakers -- would have toget permits from state pollution authorities specifying thattheir emissions don't exceed limits under the Clean Air Act.The rules were to have been released as early as today.   EPA officials have made clear they wouldn't agree to theWhite House plan and say the issue is still being negotiated.   The EPA wants to require companies to give stateregulators 45 days notice before making operating changesthat cause small increases in emissions. The notice wouldallow for public hearings, where environmentalists and otherscould object to the changes and ask regulators to block them.   The EPA considers the rules crucial to administering theClean Air Act and reducing air pollution. But White Houseofficials say the rules are too onerous and costly forbusiness, and have battled with the EPA over earlierproposals on permits. Now, they are using the president'smoratorium to bolster their arguments.   A senior administration official said the White HouseCompetitiveness Council is pushing a plan under whichcompanies could make changes in their operations after givingregulators two weeks to object. There would be no publichearings and no formal opportunity for environmentalists tostop the changes. Instead, the EPA and state regulators wouldbe charged with monitoring the changes to see that businessesare complying with the permitted level of emissions.   About 34,000 industrial facilities will be covered by thepermits, which will set differing standards depending on thetype of plant and emissions. Administration officialsacknowledge regulators couldn't possibly check on all thosefacilities.   &quot;We'd be relying on EPA and state regulators&quot; to policethe permits, a senior administration official said. &quot;They'llwatch facilities they think have gone wrong.&quot;   In addition, the EPA had been planning to give smallbusinesses a special temporary exemption from the permitrules. But the council wants to make the exemptions permanentfor small businesses.   The White House says it considers the permit system undulyburdensome on business. Getting a permit initially could take18 months, the administration calculates, and it wants tomake sure that businesses don't need to repeat that processafter making only small changes. Officials contend that anauto paint shop that switches from red paint to green paintcould be forced to get a permit revision because the greenpaint may contain more smog-causing pollutants.   However, environmentalists contend that substantiallyeasing the permit system would create a huge loophole in theClean Air Act that would allow companies to increase theirpollution significantly without anyone knowing.   Regulations arising from the Clean Air Act are supposedlyexempt from the regulatory moratorium because they are basedon statutes. The White House said it won't object to permitscalled for in the law, but said it has the right to modifythe scope of the permits as well as the requirements forrevisions. The EPA is already late in issuing permitregulations under the Clean Air Act, largely because offights with the White House.   Environmental issues are clearly a central target of theregulatory moratorium. White House officials say they arelooking at ways to ease restrictions on wetlands developmentby specifically setting aside certain areas, such as theEverglades, while permitting development on many other areas.   The White House formally kicked off the moratoriumyesterday in an open meeting with business lobbyists andtrade association heads. The administration outlined severalsteps, most of which have already been announced, to helpbusinesses get access to capital.   The Internal Revenue Service also said it would easereporting requirements under the payroll tax system. Amongthe changes the IRS plans is allowing companies to makepayroll tax payments electronically from their bank accounts.The White House contends that changing the payroll tax systemcould save companies $6 billion in annual paperwork costs.</TEXT></DOC>
