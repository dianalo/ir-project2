The counting efficiency of this method wasdetermined to be 42.0% by comparing the results obtained with those determinedby liquid scintillation counting. This method proved to be useful becauseof the relatively high counting efficiency for {alpha}-particles, easysample preparation, and negligible quenching effects. (author) 6 refs.;3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
