The NRC is revising that noticeto provide information on their grant program for FY 1989 (October 1, 1988through September 30, 1989).    <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope and Purpose of this Announcement    </ITAG>Pursuant to section 31.a. and 141.b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954,as amended, the NRC's Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research proposes tosupport educational institutions, nonprofit institutions, state and localgovernments, and professional societies through providing funds for expansion,exchange and transfer to knowledge, ideas and concepts directed towardthe research program. The program includes, but is not limited to supportof professional meetings, symposia, conferences, national and internationalcommissions, and publications. In addition, NRC has a limited amount forresearch grants to educational institutions (see topics below). The FY1989 ceiling for these grants is approximately $1,200,000.00_with approximately$600,000.00 of this amount available for new grants.     The primary purpose of this program is to stimulate research to providea technological base for the safety assessment of systems and subsystemstechnologies used in nuclear power applications. The results of this programwill be to increase public understanding relating to nuclear safety, topool the funds of theoretical and practical knowledge and technical information,and ultimately to enhance the protection of the public health and safety.    NRC encourages educational institutions to submit research grant proposalsin the following areas.    1. Development of advanced computational methods for solving dynamic problemsin nuclear reactor coolant systems under accident conditions.     2. Serve accident evaluation including, high temperature chemistry of serveaccident reactor radionuclides; advanced thermal hydraulic modeling offluids including combustible gases and molten core materials in reactorprimary systems during severe accidents.    3. Advanced demograhic models or statistical methods to predict populationdensity and distribution around future power reactor sites.     4. High temperature material interactions during severe accidents (e.g.,core/concrete, core debris/vessel components).     5. Steam explosions in reactors during severe accidents.     6. Human factors evaluation including criteria and guidelines to determinethe risk reduction from application of human factors requirements on NuclearPower Plant operations and maintenance.     7. Methods for the nuclear industry to use the growing pool of human preformancedata.     8. Development of methodology for Risk and Reliability Analysis of closedloop control systems including advanced digital based control systems.    9. Develop and codify pragmatic, statistically valid, methods for updatingsevere accident frequency and consequence analysis to reflect results ofnew operational, experimental, and calculational data.     10. Develop merit of methods and procedures for establishing the degreeto which Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) results converge with operationaldata.11. Development of methods to analyze and understand aging effects, improvedexamination and testing methods for determining condition of structuresand components, and methods to assess residual lifetime of structures andcomponents.12. Development of methods for assuring component structural reliability,realistic methods to define the probabilities of radioactive release dueto earthquakes.13. Development of methods for assuring integrity of the primary system,i.e., pressure vessels, piping, steam generator tubing.14. Development of methods to establish and validate decommissioning criteria,and effects of water chemistry on the primary system integrity.15. Design of concepts to increase the safety of industrial radiographydevices.16. Development of comprehensive bibliography and analysis of data/studyresults on personnel dosimetry defining quantitative relationship betweenindividuals absorbed dose and dosimeter measured dose.17. Development of bases for a mandated or regulated periodic maintenanceand replacement program for industrial radiography devices based on typeof device, type of operation and operational environment.18. Development of improved instrumentation or techniques for measuringactivities, radiation dose, and dose rates, especially from small radioactiveparticles.19. Development of methods for contamination prevention, measurement andcontrol; and improved radiological air sampling methodology.20. Investigation of the types, sensitivity and linearity of various biologicaleffects of radiation that could be used as biological dosimeters.21. Research on the metabolism of radionuclides and their compounds relativeto calculation of internal dose.22. Investigation of placental transfer of, and fetal doses from radionuclidesincorporated by the pregnant worker.23. Investigation of the efficacy of radioactive protective agents.24. Compile bibliography of ionizing radiation hormesis publications.25. Develop methodology for implementation of a nonprescriptive regulatoryprocess at NRC, considering such factors as: (a) The most effective framework,(b) the pros/cons and practice aspects of its implementation and (c) thechanges needed in NRC's current process and legislation to implement sucha change.<ITAG tagnum="84">Eligible Applicants</ITAG>Educational institutions, nonprofit entities, State and local governmentsand professional societies are eligible to apply for a grant under thisannouncement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Factors Generally Indicating Support Through Grants</ITAG>The NRC's benefit from the results of grants should be no greater thanfor other interested parties, i.e., the public must be the primary beneficiaryof the work performed. For example, surveys, studies, or research whichprovide specific information or data necessary for the NRC to exerciseits regulatory or research mission responsibilities should be obtainedby procurement contracts.1. The primary purpose is to aid or support the development of knowledgeor understanding of the subject or phenomena under study.2. The exact course of the work and its outcome are not defined preciselyand specific points in time for achievement of significant results maynot be specified.3. NRC desires that the nature of the proposed investigation be such thatthe recipient will bear prime responsibility for the conduct of the researchand exercise judgment and original thought toward attaining the scientificgoals within broad parameters of the proposed research areas and the resourcesprovided.4. Meaningful technical reports (as distinguished from Semi-Annual StatusReports) can be prepared only as new findings are made, rather than ona predetermined time schedule.5.
