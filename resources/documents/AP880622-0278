RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Curtis Crawford, a black man, owes part of his success toaffirmative action _ a process that a decade ago denied AllanBakke, a white man, admission to medical school.   Both men are symbols of the evolving struggle for racialequality in America.   Crawford, who runs a $3.5 billion annual program for IBM, saysaffirmative action played a big part in his rapid rise tohigh-powered executive with one of the nation's corporate giants.But he says hard work and personal sacrifice were essential as well.   ``IBM's commitment to affirmative action played a very majorrole in providing a place for me to develop to my fullest,'' hesaid. ``At the same time, I think I earned everything based on myabilities. I put in a lot of hard work and pain.''   In the 10 years since the Supreme Court first endorsed theconcept in the case of Bakke, a would-be medical student,affirmative action has become even more of a fixture in Americansociety _ in private enterprise, in law and medical schools, inlocal police and fire departments.   But preferences based on race and gender remain highlycontroversial, particularly fixed quotas that spark heated debateover ``reverse discrimination.''   The Supreme Court on June 28, 1978, ruled that Bakke, then a37-year-old engineer, wrongly was denied admission to studymedicine at the University of California at Davis.   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, said a fixed quota for racialminorities at the medical school unlawfully excluded Bakke becausehe is white. He had been passed over while less-qualifiedapplicants were admitted under a special program.   But a different 5-4 alignment said colleges may consider race asone factor in deciding who gets admitted.   The Bakke case galvanized public opinion as have few legalbattles in the nation's history.   But it marked only the start of a continuing debate on how farthe nation should go to redress past discrimination.   Bakke himself has since graduated and become a doctor, whilestudiously avoiding the limelight and declining to discuss his case.   Bakke said he has been working as an anesthesiologist at theOlmstead Medical Group in Rochester, Minn. for about the past twoyears. He said the multi-speciality group is not associated withthe Mayo Clinic, where he took residency training beginning in1982. Asked if he would consent to an interview he said, ``I justreally don't want to do it at all.''   IBM executive Crawford started with the company 15 years ago,about a year out of college.   Today he is a vice president at the company's plant in Montvale,N.J., in charge of marketing its line of new personal computers,the Personal System II. Yearly sales are around $3.5 billion.   Crawford, son of factory-worker parents and reared in what hedescribes as the poor part of Joliet, Ill., is no friend of racialquotas.   ``I've never been in favor of specific numbers. That's not theway to achieve equality,'' he said.   He is a strong supporter of American institutions thatdemonstrate steady commitment to equality by providingopportunities for minorities and women to get ahead.   ``We believe affirmative action makes good business sense,'' hesaid. ``The company also is fulfilling its social responsibility.''   Crawford is a symbol of the boon affirmative action can be tomiddle class blacks, Hispanics, other minorities and women.   On the other hand, civil rights leaders say it has failed toease spiraling unemployment that helps hold the nation's innercities in the grip of poverty, despair and drugs.   The Reagan administration has fought a losing rear-guard battlefor the past eight years to restrict back pay or other compensationin suits based on claims of affirmative action violations toindividuals who can prove they were victims of bias.   The nation's highest court rejected that argument in a series ofcases. But fragmented voting among the justices and the advent ofnew Reagan appointees on the court could mean an uncertain futurefor affirmative action.   In recent rulings, the court has embraced preferential treatmentfor women and minorities in hiring and promotion. It even hasendorsed quotas, as long as they are narrowly tailored to overcomeproven past discrimination and do not trammel unnecessarily therights of white males.   American business also has demonstrated support for affirmativeaction, particularly big corporations and industry leaders like IBM.   ``We're allowing people in this country to participate in theeconomic process. It's well worth it,'' says Walton E. Burdick,IBM's vice president of personnel.   IBM began recruiting at black colleges in the early 1950s, andBurdick emphasized the continuing need for long-term commitment.   ``There has to be a sustained effort,'' he said. ``You can'tdecide on Friday night to be a leader in the fight for equality andbe there Monday morning.''   The National Association of Manufacturers, in its officialpolicy, regards affirmative action ``as an effective method ofachieving civil rights progress. Industry realizes that it is goodbusiness policy to encourage and promote programs that enhanceminority and female participation at all levels within theworkplace.''   Clearly defined legal standards for such preferences also can bea bulwark against lawsuits by white males who believe they weredenied jobs or promotions unfairly.   Still, many companies are reluctant to talk about theiraffirmative action programs.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
