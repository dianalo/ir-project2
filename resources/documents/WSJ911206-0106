But they hintedstrongly that banks will take a clubbing because cash raisedby asset sales will fall far short of covering the billionsof dollars in debt.   Yesterday, the Maxwell family's main private companiesfiled for protection from creditors with the U.K. courtsafter a move to seek additional equity capital failed. Theheart of the assets involved is the Maxwell-familycontrolling stakes in publicly traded Maxwell CommunicationCorp. and Mirror Group Newspapers -- 68% and 51%respectively. They also include Mr. Maxwell's yacht, luxurycars and several airplanes -- all corporate assets thatallowed the 68-year-old publisher to live like a corporateking.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Maxwell, who was found dead off his yacht Nov. 5, issuspected of looting more than $1 billion from his publiccompanies -- including $500 million in pension funds -- tocover debt problems in his private concerns. Some of thosepension funds are thought to be recoverable, though how muchis unclear, pension investigators say.   In yet another development yesterday pointing tosuspicious financial dealing within the Maxwell empire,Maxwell Communication executives reported that they weremissing shares in Berlitz International Inc., a company MCCis in the process of selling to Fukutake Publishing Co. ofJapan.   In early November, Robert Maxwell's heirs announced anagreement to sell 10.6 million shares, or 56% of Berlitz'scommon shares outstanding, to Fukutake for $265 million, or$25 a share; that money was to go toward paying off MCC debt.   Sally McElwreath, a spokeswoman for MCC and its publishingunit Macmillan Inc., the shares' beneficial owner, said thecompanies were &quot;taking steps&quot; to recover the missing sharesof Berlitz, the foreign-language school company.   &quot;It looks like we can't find some of those shares,&quot; Ms.McElwreath said. &quot;It looks like they were transferred out,but where we don't know.&quot; MCC, she said, also doesn't knowhow many shares are missing. She added that &quot;the company andits counsel&quot; have launched an inquiry but haven't yetcontacted federal authorities.   Ms. McElwreath said Fukutake hasn't yet paid for theshares. The sale will continue, she said.   In Okayama, Japan, Toshio Nagao, a spokesman for Fukutakedeclined to say how the reported loss would affect the deal.   Mr. Nagao stressed that his company is still proceedingwith its original plan to reach a formal contract before theend of December, saying, &quot;Based on the spirit of thememorandum, {we} are working positively in good faith.&quot;   Chief administrator of the Maxwell properties, John Talbotof Arthur Andersen andamp; Co., said he hoped to find buyers forthe entire blocks of shares of the two public companies butdidn't rule out breaking them apart if shoppers bid more forthe parts than for the whole. He also hinted strongly that,unless buyers were found quickly for anemic or loss-plaguedMaxwell enterprises, the companies would be shut downpromptly.   The pronouncement bodes ill for two private Maxwellnewpapers, the New York Daily News and the London-basedEuropean, a weekly styled after USA Today. The Daily News isexpected to lose money this year, even though the Maxwellfamily invested $35 million in it after taking it over thisspring. Yesterday, the paper filed for protection fromcreditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. TheEuropean isn't expected to be profitable for a number ofyears.   Mr. Talbot declined to estimate what he thought any ofthese assets, individually or collectively, would fetch orwhat percentage of banks' debts the proceeds would cover.Though bank stocks dropped sharply on London's stockexchange, London banking analysts said the Maxwell collapse-- while a wallop -- isn't likely to drag any banks down.   Creditor banks have been silent on the amounts involved,but one banking analyst suggested the biggest Maxwell lendersNational Westminster Bank PLC, Barclays PLC, Midland Bank PLCand Lloyds Bank PLC -- could lose as much as #50 million($89.1 million) apiece. But Robin MonroDavies, managingdirector of IBCA Ltd., a debt-rating service, said theMaxwell collapse is &quot;not life-threatening for any particularbank. We're not putting any bank on rating watch.&quot;   Some banks say their loans are well secured againstMaxwell group assets. Meanwhile, London banking sources saythere are signs that a secondary market is beginning todevelop for the unsecured Maxwell group debt, with the loanstrading at a steep discount.   The collapse came after the late Mr. Maxwell's sons, Kevinand Ian, beat their bankers into court by asking a Britishcourt yesterday to appoint administrators to run two closelyheld holding companies, Headington Investments and RobertMaxwell Group Ltd. While there are about 100 private Maxwellcompanies, these control most of the privately owned Maxwellassets. Both Maxwells have resigned all seats from theMaxwell public companies.   The move, which Mr. Talbot said had the support of mostMaxwell banks, didn't satisfy everyone. Later in the day,Swiss Bank Corp., owed #55 million by a private Maxwellholding company, filed its own petition -- the equivalent ofinvoluntary bankruptcy -- essentially to liquidate theconcern. The move touched off fears that other banks mightfollow suit, throwing an orderly attempt to sort out theMaxwell collapse into chaos.   Whatever prices the Maxwell properties fetch, thereappears to be no lack of interest. But the greatest interestwill come from those seeking the parts, not the whole, of thepublic companies, says Martin Maleska, Robert Maxwell'sformer top merger and acquisition man in the U.S.   &quot;Some of these assets are great, but to sell all of{Maxwell Communication Corp.} will be tough,&quot; says Mr.Maleska, who recently became a managing director of Veronis,Suhler andamp; Associates Inc., a New York-based media investmentbanker. MCC's Macmillan Inc. unit is &quot;is a very attractivebook publishing company,&quot; Mr. Maleska says, specificallyciting its college-textbook division as &quot;very&quot; profitable. &quot;Alot of people are interested in the underlying assets ofMCC,&quot; he says, but he adds: &quot;To pay the price for theproperty is one thing, but to get {a buyer} to assume thedebt, that's hard.&quot;   The debt issue of both the public and private Maxwellcompanies is further clouded by the allegedly unauthorizedloans and transfers of more than $500 million in Mirror Grouppension funds to private Maxwell assets. Unless those fundsare recoverable -- or their loss is covered by insurance --&quot;they become another liability&quot; that could further underminethe value of Mirror Group, a London-based analyst says.   K-III Holdings Inc., the partnership controlled by buy-outconcern Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., is a logical bidder inacquiring at least pieces of Macmillan, investment bankerssay. But these bankers said K-III, which is run by formerMacmillan president William F. Reilly, would likely hold outfor the lowest possible price as the need to dispose of theproperty becomes more severe. Maxwell beat out KKR in 1988and purchased Macmillan for $2.7 billion. K-III declinedcomment.   One publishing executive said the Macmillan publishingproperties combined (excluding a joint-venture in elementaryand high-school texts) have annual profit of about $42million. The executive estimated that the properties togethercould fetch &quot;between $400 million and $500 million,&quot; andspeculated that the properties would attract a better priceas a portfolio, rather than sold piecemeal.   The other interested parties are said to include ParamountCommunication Inc., Germany's Bertelsmann AG and ReedInternational PLC. Paramount declined comment; Reed didn'treturn phone calls. Trefoil Capital Investors L.P., a $450million investment fund formed by Walt Disney Co.'s vicechairman, Roy Disney, and principals of his Shamrock HoldingsInc., is reportedly also interested in purchasing Macmillan.Trefoil declined comment.   Along with the Daily News and the European, other privateMaxwell assets may not fare so well. In the U.S., the Maxwellfamily has several unprofitable properties. The Racing Times,started less than a year ago, faces stiff competition againstthe racetrack powerhouse Daily Racing Form, owned by K-III.It's believed the Racing Times will cost at least $20 millionbefore it sees a profit, though the paper does appear to beselling well at the track.   There could, of course, be buyers for both the Daily Newsand the European. One potential Daily News buyer is New Yorkreal estate mogul Mort Zuckerman, who last spring held briefnegotiations with Tribune Co. executives about taking overthe Daily News. Mr. Zuckerman said in an interview the DailyNews is &quot;still an interesting venture&quot; but wants to know moreabout the current status of the paper. &quot;The News is a verycomplicated venture, in the sense there are a lot of shutdownliabilities,&quot; said Mr. Zuckerman. &quot;I don't know what happenedto the money Tribune gave Maxwell or how the paper isoperating.&quot;   As for the European, at least some analysts said it couldattract bargain-hunters who think the late Mr. Maxwell mayhave been correct that an increasingly unified Europe isready for what he dubbed the region's &quot;first national paper.&quot;While still not profitable, circulation and marketpenetration has been steadily climbing.   &quot;In terms of raw numbers of readers, the Maxwell visionfor the European has been vindicated,&quot; said David Grantham,editorial director for London-based European Media andamp; Finance,a newsletter.   Trefoil Capital, the investment fund, is reportedlyinterested in buying some other Maxwell units besidesMacmillan: Official Airline Guides and newspaper publishersMaariv-Modiin Group in Israel and Magyar Hirlap in Hungary.   Meanwhile, British auditors and Serious Fraud Officeinvestigators tracking dealings between private and publicMaxwell interests now say the total of the transfers betweenthe interests, including pension funds, probably exceeds $1billion.   The Serious Fraud Office investigations into thedisappearance of Mirror Group pension funds are focused onBishopsgate Investments Management Ltd., a private Maxwellconcern that is said to have controlled more than half thefund.   Bishopsgate itself said yesterday that it had hired itsown lawyer to recover 25 million Maxwell Communication sharesthat are pension-fund assets &quot;currently in the hands ofcertain financial institutions.&quot; At 35 pence a share -- thevalue of Maxwell Communications shares when they weresuspended this week -- the stake is valued at about $15.6million. Bishopsgate didn't elaborate, but investigators saysome of the questionable pension-fund transfers involved theuse of fund-owned shares to collateralize loans made toMaxwell private concerns.   As the pension scandal unfolds, Britain's Parliament ispreparing legislation that would prevent any British companyfrom investing more than 5% of pension-fund assets intoinstruments the company controls. The Serious Fraud Officereported that it was already investigating three cases ofalleged company-pension-fund fraud before being ordered totrack down the Mirror Group money.</TEXT></DOC>
