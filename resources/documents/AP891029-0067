An official of the university's Ocean Research Institute saidthe virus was detected earlier this month in four or five of thecenter's 100 computers, but was believed to have first infected thecomputers in September.   The virus was found only in personal computers being used byresearchers, and not major computer systems, the official said,requesting anonymity. He said the damage was not serious.

The report said the virus was the most sophisticated yetdetected in Japan, where the problem is not widespread. TokyoUniversity is Japan's most prestigious university.   Computer viruses, created by unknown programmers, are pieces ofsoftware that make copies of themselves and spread from one machineto another through infected floppy disks, office networks ortelephone access lines.   Once activated, the rogue program copies itself like a breedinggerm, eating away processing power and storage space or destroyinginformation. About 30 viruses are known to exist.</TEXT></DOC>
