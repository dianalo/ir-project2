In extreme cases, the IRS can collect delinquent bills bylevying on wages, bank accounts, or other assets. Newguidelines say agents may use facsimile wires, instead of themail, to send levy notices and cancellations to employers,banks, and others that agree to it. Financial institutionsmust freeze an account for 21 days before sending cash to theIRS; the new guidelines say institutions can't stop payinginterest during a freeze and must send it to the IRS if thebalance is below the levy. Institutions may not deduct feesfrom levy amounts.</LP><TEXT>   The guidelines do call for some compassion. SocialSecurity, veterans', pension, and foster-care benefits aresubject to levy under the law; but the guidelines note thatlevies would thwart the purposes of these benefits. Thus,agents should consider hardship and whether other availablefunds are adequate to pay the delinquent taxes.   &quot;Levy {on} these types of income only in flagrant andaggravated cases,&quot; the guidelines tell agents.                                                                                                          NOT TO WORRY: Uncle Sam is paying refunds, despite rumorsto the contrary.   Return preparers are picking up the false reports,especially in the Southeast. Generally, customers call aboutfiling early, because they've heard the government is goingto divert refunds to pay for the war. There's no truth inthat, says the Treasury. The IRS is authorizing refunds --over two million of them, averaging $963, by Feb. 8. And theTreasury is paying them as usual.   Tom Bloch, president of H andamp; R Block, says the rumor is&quot;pretty ridiculous,&quot; but &quot;fairly widespread.&quot; Terry Blitz, aBlock regional director, says variations in Tennessee and theCarolinas were that refunds wouldn't be paid until June 30,or Nov. 30, on claims filed after Feb. 28. The rumor has hitLouisiana. And John Hewitt, president of Jackson Hewitt TaxService, a national chain, says offices in Virginia andDallas have had inquiries about it.                                                                                                          SIT TIGHT, if the IRS has questioned pension income onyour 1988 return.   The IRS says it will try to resolve the apparentdiscrepancies by itself. It sent 780,000 queries -- thousandsprobably unnecessary -- to filers who put taxable pension orannuity income correctly on 1988 returns, but failed to listtotal pensions. The IRS needs totals for initial computermatching of return entries with pension payers' reports onForm 1099R. Filers' errors were compounded when new computersoftware for secondary manual screening omitted 1099R dataused to clear up initial mismatches.   The taxpayers mostly had pension income that was onlypartly taxable. The IRS said earlier that the best reply is a1099R copy showing total pension income. That still holds,but now the IRS is redoing its software so agents can screenthe 1988 returns. Thus, it says, notice recipients needn'treply at all. Instead, the IRS will try to close the caseswith data it has and notify the filers that no other actionis needed.   &quot;The onus is on our side,&quot; an IRS spokesman adds.                                                                                                          NO MAN IS AN ISLAND. But Fred W. Allnut of Maryland arguedthat because IRS rules lack certain control numbers, onlycitizens living on U.S. &quot;insular possessions&quot; must reportincome to the IRS -- and then only income from options. Inreply, the Tax Court upheld civil fraud penalties forAllnut's failure to report taxable income of $3.8 millionover six years and ordered a $25,000 penalty for frivolousclaims.                                                                                                          WAS THE PEN MIGHTIER? Phillip S. Fry, author of such booksas &quot;Pay No Income Tax Without Going to Jail,&quot; pleaded guiltyof tax fraud in 1986 and went to jail. Now the Tax Court hasrejected his claims of business losses in 1977-1980, found hehad gross receipts of $5.2 million and expenses of $3.5million, and upheld civil fraud penalties for all four years.                                                                                                          LATE-PAYMENT CHARGES on their mortgage may not be deductedas interest, the Tax Court told Robert G. and Norita C. Westof Danville, Calif. They didn't prove the charges were forinterest rather than for administrative costs, penalties, orcompensation for lost earnings.                                                                                                          STOCK BONUSES to executives may be revoked to save taxes,the IRS indicates.   Private ruling 9104039 concerns arcane Section 83(b)elections used by people who are compensated with property,such as company stock, with a forfeiture risk, such as avesting period. Recipients are taxable on the market value,less any payment, at the time of full vesting. But those whothink the value -- and the tax -- will rise between the awardand vesting dates may elect under 83(b) to be taxed at thetime of the award. The catch: If the stock is forfeited, sois the tax; if the value falls, the election may be revokedonly with IRS consent.   Yet the new ruling let an anonymous concern rescind stockawards in the tax year they were made -- and said related83(b) elections were thereby annulled. The company rescindedthe awards because they were too costly. But Michael E.Mooney, a Boston lawyer, says the ruling opens a possibleescape from 83(b) elections that within the same tax yearprove to be mistakes.   The IRS's ruling indicates employees can undo electionswithout its consent by getting employers to rescind awards,Mooney says.                                                                                                          BRIEFS: Because of staff cutbacks, Massachusetts' RevenueDepartment warns that it may take two to three times longerto issue state refund checks. . . .
