The testinghas shown that the relatively viscous form of oxidized bitumen that wasused has been able to meet all performance requirements. Using a 53-mmWerner and Pfleiderer extruder, operated by personnel of WasteChem Corporationof Paramus, New Jersey, laboratory-scale, molded samples of ASTM D312,type III, air-blown bitumen were prepared for laboratory performancetesting. A surrogate, low-level, mixed liquid waste, formulated to representan actual on-site waste at ORNL, was used. The mixed liquid waste containedapproximately 30 wt % sodium nitrate, in addition to eight heavy metals,cold cesium, and strontium. Samples tested contained three levels ofwaste loading: that is, 40, 50, and 60 wt % salt. Performance test resultsinclude the 90-day American Nuclear Society (ANS) 16.1 leach test, withleach indices reported for all cations and anions, in addition to theEP toxicity test, at all levels of waste loading. Additionally, testresults presented include the unconfined compressive strength and surfacemorphology utilizing scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Data presentedinclude correlations between waste form loading and test results, inaddition to their relationship to regulatory performance requirements.</TEXT></DOC>
