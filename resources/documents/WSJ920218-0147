After all theeffort, only a few dozen people came.   Recently, he tried to drum up another crowd for Mr.Tsongas, this time at the University of New Hampshire. Aprevious appearance there had drawn fewer than 50 people. Theturnout this time was more than 500.   &quot;It's unbelievable]&quot; Mr. Ladd says with a satisfied smile.&quot;All of sudden everything is clicking. We're moving at a paceno one ever anticipated.&quot;   For Mr. Ladd, the archetypal young campaign activist, ithas been a wild roller-coaster ride from obscurity to theverge of success. For months he felt like Don Quixote,working seven-day weeks and 16-hour days, sometimes sleepingon an office floor and usually subsisting on spaghetti. Now,it is finally the day of the New Hampshire primary, and withMr. Tsongas leading in the polls, Mr. Ladd's impossible dreamis tantalizingly close to fulfillment.   For all the attention given to high-powered strategistsand glitzy media, politics in this snowy state is practicedon the &quot;retail&quot; level: person-to-person, one vote at a time.That is what makes grass-roots activists like Mr. Laddindispensible. They provide the enthusiasm and the elbowgrease that make campaigns go, manning the phone banks,compiling the mailing lists, knocking on doors, distributingleaflets on frigid street corners, even hanging the buntingat speech sites.   The crew that Mr. Ladd himself leads for Mr. Tsongas ismore fanatical than most, and for good reason. Until barelytwo weeks ago, no one gave their candidate a chance. &quot;Theyare believers with no `off' switch,&quot; Mr. Tsongas saysproudly. &quot;There isn't one of them who signed on because theythought I was going to win.&quot;   Senior aides to the Massachusetts Democrat think of thesemen and women in their 20s as &quot;soldiers for Tsongas.&quot; Amongthemselves, they are &quot;the Tsongi,&quot; and have been known tostay up until 2 a.m. quoting passages from their candidate'swritings. &quot;There's a certain sickness to it,&quot; Mr. Laddconcedes. But he adds: &quot;We have our guy, and his name is PaulTsongas.&quot;   Thirteen of the Tsongi live in a two-bedroom apartmentcalled &quot;the Ladd pad,&quot; which is part tenement, part shrine.The walls are decorated only with Tsongas campaign postersand close-up pictures of the candidate. They sleep onmattresses strewn on the floor. Neither hygiene nor nutritionare priorities there, so Mr. Ladd has become proficient atscrounging free meals and warm water elsewhere. He has beenknown to wheedle a shower at the YMCA by professing to takeits &quot;free trial day.&quot;   Work is a jumble of meetings with supporters and would-besupporters as well as a near-constant series of escapadesthat are designed to raise the candidate's visibility, calledVizes. At 7:30 one morning in November his Viz duty was alongan exit ramp of Manchester's Route 293. He and a partner,Andrew Nelson, waved Tsongas signs and shouted greetings torush-hour traffic until a state policeman gestured for themto leave. (Even then they stayed a few minutes longer.) Mr.Ladd once even sacrificed his entire week's wage of $50 fromthe Tsongas campaign to rent a jumpsuit, cape and wig just soone of his fellow workers could masquerade as Elvis Presleycarrying a Tsongas sign.   Mr. Ladd got into this game in early 1991, when he hadjust completed a cross-country jaunt and didn't have a clearnotion about what he wanted to do. On the advice of familyand friends he applied to the Tsongas campaign, starting inBoston as an office go-fer. Later he moved up to become adriver for the candidate, and in June moved back to hisnative New Hampshire to help staff the campaign's clutteredoffice here.   Back then, when one of Mr. Ladd's chief tasks was toexplain how to pronounce the candidate's name, it was all theTsongi could do just to get noticed. At one point, Mr. Ladddraped his family's speedboat with a Tsongas banner andbuzzed a Harkin cocktail party being held aboard a cruiseship on Lake Winnipesaukee.   Little changed into the fall. Even the aides to othercandidates seemed imposing. They carried fancy communicationsgear and wore suits that, at least to Mr. Ladd, looked moreexpensive than his ancient car. &quot;I feel like a fish amongsharks,&quot; he confided to Mr. Nelson.   But he never lost faith. In November, when workers for BobKerrey marched with banners past the Tsongas office, Mr. Laddand his followers rose up as one, grabbed their own signs andfollowed them down the street until they reached the officeof Republican candidate Patrick Buchanan. Then Mr. Ladd ledthe group inside. &quot;We're going to win. We're going to win,&quot;they chanted, even though almost no one thought they could.   That period also produced one of Mr. Ladd's favoriteencounters with Mr. Tsongas. While almost no one was takinghis campaign seriously, a lone column carried in the BostonGlobe suggested that Mr. Tsongas might have a chance becauseof his strong organization in New Hampshire. &quot;This is becauseof you guys,&quot; Mr. Tsongas said, tossing a copy of thenewspaper to Mr. Ladd. Just that small bit of encouragement,Mr. Ladd says, was &quot;enough gas to keep you going.&quot;   Then, in a rush, everything changed. Front-running BillClinton faltered, none of the other candidates could arousemuch enthusiasm, and Mr. Tsongas, with his New Englandcredentials and low-key manner, suddenly shot to the head ofthe pack. Even for Mr. Ladd, with all the fervor of a truebeliever, the transformation has been shocking. At aDartmouth College event earlier this month, he cordoned off asection of chairs in the back of the hall, fearing the roomwould look empty when Mr. Tsongas spoke. But more than 600people arrived and not only the cordoned-off section filledup, but so did the balcony, and people had to be turned awayfor fear of creating a fire hazard.   In this final few days of the campaign, Mr. Ladd hasbarely slept. Hundreds of volunteers have been bused fromMassachusetts and Maryland. Mr. Ladd says he has bitten agroove in his lip from nervousness and tension, and professesto be operating on nothing but adrenaline. He also now has alot more to manage. The office's cavelike basement has beenconverted into a high-tech &quot;situation room,&quot; lined withcomputer printouts detailing block-by-block get-out-the-voteplans for the entire state. And the rest of the place is socrowded with newly minted devotees that they are all buttripping over each other.   &quot;Sometimes you wonder, `Will it come through, was it worthit?'&quot; Mr. Ladd muses. But, he concludes, &quot;We know how muchwe've built, and that does something for your confidence.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
