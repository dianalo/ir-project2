Even then, a coal seamless than 1.2 m thick was not considered good enough for mining in theJharia coal field. In the northeastern region coal seams about that thicknesswere mined along their exposures only. Today many mines require selectivemining of bedded deposits by opencast methods. The current thinking ofselective mining is limited to manual mining only. But it should be possibleto mine selectively, bands of high quality material through mechanizedmining. A continuous miner for selective excavation is described.</TEXT></DOC>
