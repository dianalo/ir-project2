The results obtained demonstratethe possibility of changing the spectral characteristics of the laserin the counterpropagating regime. In particular, the emission linewidthcan be decreased by increasing the injected intensity. The maximum narrowingis limited by the existence of the noise-induced transition between thelaser modes and determined by the equality of time scale for the first-passagetime and the time required for the steady-state spectrum to develop.14 references.</TEXT></DOC>
