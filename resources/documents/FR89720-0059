Southern Natural Gas Company</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">[Docket No. CP89-1610-000]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="44">July 13, 1989.</ITAG>Take notice that on June 13, 1989, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern)P.O. Box 2563, Birmingham, Alabama 35303-3563, filed in Docket No. CP89-1610-000a request, as supplemented June 27, 1989, purusant to andSection;157.205of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) for authorizationto construct, install and operate pipeline facilities in Vermilion, Iberia,and St. Martin Parishes, Louisiana under the authorization issued in DocketNo. CP82-406-000 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as morefully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission andopen to public inspection. Southern proposed to construct, install, and operate the proposed pipelinefacilities in order to provide its markets direct access to additionalgas reserves located in the offshore Louisiana area beyond the reach ofits existing gas supply facilities. The proposed pipeline would connectdirectly to Southern's existing pipeline system, both the Sea Robin PipelineCompany (Sea Robin) Compressor Station and Sabine Pipe Line Company's (Sabine)Henry Hub header located at the outlet of Texaco Inc.'s (Texaco) Henrygas processing plant (Sabine Henry Hub), in Erath, Vermilion Parish, Louisiana.Specifically, Southern proposes to construct, install, and operate: (i)A meter station, consisting of two 12-inch meter runs along with flow controlvalves and other appurtenances, located at the Sea Robin Compressor Station;(ii) a meter station, located at the south end of Southern's existing 16-inchErath Bypass Line, adjacent to Sabine's Henry Hub header, consisting oftwo 12-inch meter runs along the flow control valves and other appurtenances;and (ii) approximately 28.6 miles of 20-inch pipeline extending from theSea Robin Compressor Station and the north end of Southern's existing 16-inchErath Bypass Line to a point of interconnection with Southern's pipelinesystem at Mile Post 2.5 on its South Section 28 pipeline in St. MartinParish, Louisiana. Southern alleges that the proposed extension of theSouth Section 28 Line would result in that pipeline having a maximum designcapacity of 225,000 Mcf per day. It is anticipated that the new pipelinewould initially transport approximately 127,000 Mcf per day.Southern states that the construction and operation of the proposed meterstation and pipeline would have no significant adverse impact on the qualityof the human environment. The total cost for all of the proposed pipelineand metering facilities is estimated to be $12,677,834. It is alleged thatalthough the exact plan of financing has not been determined, Southernexpects that the cost of constructing and installing the proposed facilitieswould be financed initially by short-term financing and/or cash from currentoperations, and ultimately from permanent financing.It is alleged that the proposed facilities are an eligible facility asdefined in andSection;57.202(b)(2)(i) of the Commission's regulations inthat they would enable Southern to attach gas supplies directly to itspipeline system for both its general system supply and in the performanceof transportation service pursuant to its blanket certificate issued pursuantto andSection;284.221 of the Commission's regulations. It is further allegedthat the specific purpose of the proposed facilities is to provide Southern'smarkets with direct access to additional gas reserves located in the offshoreLouisiana area beyond the reach of its existing gas supply facilities.It is stated that the proposed facilities would allow Southern to extendits South Section 28 Line and establish a direct connection with the SeaRobin Compressor Station and the Sabine Henry Hub, so that its customerswould have access to available gas supplies without the incurrence of thirdparty transportation charges. It is averred that pursuant to Southern'stransportation tariff, the Sea Robin Compressor Station and the SabineHenry Hub interconnection would become new receipt points under all existingand future transportation service agreements.Southern states that during 1988, the Sea Robin pipeline system had anaverage daily throughput of 512,300 Mcf per day. Of these volumes, 503,434Mcf per day represent volumes transported through Sea Robin's system. Inaddition to the gas available from Sea Robin, Southern alleges that itsproposal to connect to the Sabine Henry Hub, would provide access to largevolumes of gas which pass through both the Sabine Henry Hub and the TexacoHenry Plant daily. The Texaco Henry Plant has a capacity of 803,000 Mcfper day, with an average daily throughput in 1987 of 274,000 Mcf per day.Reported volumes through the Sabine Henry Hub are approximately 750,000Mcf per day, consisting of approximately 350,000 Mcf per day flowing fromthe Texaco Henry Plant and approximately 400,000 Mcf per day originatingfrom Sabine's mainline sources and the pipelines connected to the SabineHerny Hub, including 100,000 Mcf from Sea Robin.Southern does not propose to charge an incremental rate to perform servicesthrough the facilities, but proposes to charge its currently effectiverates under the existing tariff. It is further indicated that transportationthrough the proposed facilities pursuant to Southern's existing tariffrepresents the most cost effective alternative Southern has been able todevise for providing its customers with direct access to the gas suppliesavailable from the Sea Robin system and the Sabine Henry Hub.Southern avers that transportation through the proposed facilities is especiallysignificant with respect to the gas supplies available on the Sea Robinsystem because Southern's pipeline system traditionally has been the marketfor one-half of Sea Robin's reserves. It is alleged that Sea Robin's systemis used primarily for transportation but because it would require incurringthird party transportation charges to move spot market gas supplies fromthe Sea Robin system to Southern system, Southern's customers have beeneconomically foreclosed from this traditional source of supply for Southern'smarkets. It is alleged that the proposed facilities would correct the inequitablesituation and once again establish the Sea Robin system as a significantsource for Southern's system requirements. <T3>Comment date: </T3>August 28, 1989, in accordance with Standard ParagraphG at the end of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">20.
