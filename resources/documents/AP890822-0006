The military, which has ruled since 1973, has indicated awillingness to negotiate, but only under certain conditions.   Both sides agree that the lack of communication in the past hadled to a mutual animosity and distrust that both sides agree must beeliminated if the future government is to enjoy stability.   Patricio Aylwin, the presidential candidate of a unitedcenter-left opposition and heavily favored to win the presidentialelection Dec. 14, recently remarked: ``We want an approach, anexchange of views.''   ``The isolation that has existed for years among civilians andmilitary is not good for the country and must end,'' Aylwin added.``The time has come for a dialogue.''   Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the right-wing army commander who has beenpresident since seizing power in September, 1973, was obliged tocall December's general elections after losing a referendum inOctober on extending his rule to 1997.   Aylwin and other opposition leaders want the dialogue to takeplace before the new government takes office March 11.   Experts expect several highly conflictive items will be on theagenda.   Ignacio Walker, a leading adviser to Aylwin on military matters,said the talks would include the role of the armed forces under thecivilian government, the continuation of the presentcommanders-in-chief in their posts, the defense budget and, probablythe most sensitive problem, how the new government will deal withthe human rights violations during Pinochet's rule.   After the 1973 coup, which toppled the elected government ofMarxist Salvadoe Allende, the military launched a campaign ofpolitical repression. Thousands of leftists were arrested, many weretortured, killed or sent into exile. Human rights groups havedocumented more than 700 cases of dissidents who disappeared afterbeing arrested by seurity agents.   The opposition has said that it will investigate all pendingcases of rights abuse and try those responsible.   Its leaders have also said they will seek to repeal an amnestylaw, issued by Pinochet, that pardoned violations occurred from 1973to 1978.   That announcement by the opposition prompted a stern warning fromthe military ranks. Gen. Fernando Matthei, the air force commanderwho is considered politically moderate and has expressed support fora dialogue, said repealing the amnesty law could unleash ``anunpredictible reaction'' by the armed forces.   ``Those wanting to repeal the law do not realize how serious thatcould be,'' Matthei added.   He noted that Pinochet himself has warned that an attempt to trymilitary officials could lead to an interruption of the democratictransition.   Opposition leaders have insisted they seek ``truth and justice,''not vengeance against the military. They are under heavy politicalpressure from human rights groups representing victims of repressionor their relatives.   Another highly controversial subject is the constitutional clausethat allows the military chiefs, including Pinochet, to retain theirmilitary commands under the civilian government. Pinochet has saidhe will remain the army's leader for as long as the constitutionallows _ until 1998.   Even some pro-government politicians contend the new leadershipmust be empowered to make changes in the military command. But thearmed forces have vowed to make no concessions on the point. Astatement issued by the army warned the armed forces are prepared to``use legitimate force'' to uphold constitution, which was draftedby the military and approved in a referendum.   And military commanders insist that their mission includesensuring internal stability as well as defending the country againstforeign attack. That is considered another potential area ofcontroversy, but opposition leaders say they are prepared to talkabout it, too, in spite of the risks and difficulties.   ``The peaceful end of military dictatorships has never been easy,and Chile cannot be an exception,'' wrote Rene Abeliuk, a SocialDemocratic leader, in a newspaper column.   The Roman Catholic Church also has urged civilians and militaryto talk about their differences ``to help the transition todemocracy.''</TEXT></DOC>
