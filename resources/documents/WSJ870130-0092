The energy concern, which has been hurt by lower oil and gas prices, said its revenue for the quarter fell 40%, to $2.38 billion from $3.91 billion.    As has been the case in recent quarters, the company's actual results were masked by several special charges. Before a $6 million loss from discontinued operations, Phillips had profit from continuing operations of $17 million, or five cents a share. That profit included a $12 million gain from asset sales and an $8 million charge from staff reductions.    In the year-ago quarter, Phillips had a loss on the disposal of discontinued operations of $171 million, making profit from continuing operations $266 million, or $1.14 a share. The year-ago period also included $314 million in gains from asset sales and a $171 million write-down of assets.    The company said results in the quarter were aided by its refining and marketing and chemicals operations, which recorded one of their best years. Phillips said its U.S. exploration and production operations and its gas liquids business reported losses for the fourth quarter and the year, primarily because of lower prices.    The company, which has been saddled with a heavy debt load related to a 1985 recapitalization plan, said it reduced its debt during 1986 to $5.93 billion from $6.8 billion at year-end 1985, in part because it completed a program to sell $2 billion in assets over about two years.    Phillips also reported $655 million in capital expenditures during 1986, down from $1.06 billion in 1985.    For all of 1986, Phillips said its net income dropped 44% to $228 million, or 89 cents a share, from $418 million, or $1.44 a share, in 1985. Revenue declined 37% to $10.02 billion from $15.8 billion.    In 1986, Phillips had profit from continuing operations of $234 million, or 91 cents a share, after a $6 million loss from discontinued operations. The year included a $144 million gain from asset sales, a $148 million gain from restructuring its retirement program, and a $62 million charge for staff reductions.    In 1985, Phillips had earnings from continuing operations of $596 million, or $2.07 a share, after $178 million in losses from discontinued operations. The period included a $380 million gain from asset sales and a $233 million asset write-down. </TEXT></DOC>
