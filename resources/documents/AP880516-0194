Mark Hatfield said Monday.   Hatfield, R-Ore., said the General Accounting Office found thedepartment's handling of information on iodine 129 contamination inthe groundwater beneath the reservation in south central Washingtonstate was ``dominated by a pattern of activity that generallydiscouraged disseminating the information within or outside theagency.''   At a news conference, Hatfield said the GAO report won't bereleased until the Energy Department has had a chance to comment.   But Hatfield said he was told in a briefing by officials of thecongressional watchdog agency that the ``pattern of activity was sopervasive'' at DOE that the information may never have beenpublicly released had not people outside the agency pursued theissue.   ``While the words `cover up'' were not specifically used in thereport, I don't know of a better phrase to describe theactitvity,'' Hatfield said.   Will Callicott, a DOE spokesman, said, ``Our own inspectorgeneral's office has looked at this before and could find nothingto substantiate any allegation of a cover up.''   The environmental assessment of the Hanford reservation wasreleased in 1986 when Hanford was under consideration as one ofthree sites for the nation's first high-level nuclear waste dump.   Hatfield said there were indications that DOE was well aware ofthe iodine contamination when it issued the environmentalassessment, though it made no mention of the problem.   ``We do not know specifically who orchestrated this situation,but GAO did inform us that there is no evidence to suggest thatthis activity was the result of directives from the upper echelonsof DOE,'' Hatfield said. ``I suspect there were individuals whodidn't want the truth known.   Hatfield said someone at DOE decided the information on theiodine contamination was ``not important'' enough to include in theenvironmental report. He also suggested the omission may have beenaimed at casting Hanford in a favorable light to validate thedepartment's selection of the reservation as a possible site forthe nuclear waste repository.   Along with Reps. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Al Swift, D-Wash.,Hatfield requested the GAO investigation last summer after DOEfinally released information on the iodine contamination at theHanford reservation.</TEXT></DOC>
