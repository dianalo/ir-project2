The dilemma involves devising a way to stop the cheating by OPECmembers who want a higher quota, boosting oil prices a bit andsetting a production ceiling in line with consumer demand.   Whatever the cartel ultimately decides, ``it's going to be avery difficult meeting,'' predicts Pierre Terzian, editor ofPetrostrategies, an oil newsletter based in Paris.   Oil prices are holding steady even though some members areopenly cheating on their production quotas. OPEC is producing atthe highest level since 1981.   On Saturday, the 13 ministers of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries are scheduled to meet to decide their strategyfor next year.   If the ministers raise OPEC's output ceiling too high, ``they'rerunning the risk of jeopardizing the whole party,'' warns PeterGignoux, the international energy director for Shearson LehmanHutton in London.   On Thursday, OPEC's eight-member monitoring panel will beginlaying the groundwork for the meeting, to be held in Vienna,Austria.   Just a year ago, oil prices were in the doldrums. The averageprice of seven crudes monitored by OPEC was $12.34 a barrel, wellunder the cartel's target of $18. West Texas Intermediate, thebenchmark American crude, fell to $12.60.   Since then, prices have risen sharply. Last week, the OPECbasket was at $17.76 a barrel. It briefly topped the $18 mark lastspring.   Futures prices for West Texas Intermediate have been about $20 abarrel. Middle Eastern varieties are several dollars a barrel belowthat.   Early in the year, the oil-producing nations curbed theirproduction to help drive up prices. But in recent months, they haveturned their taps wider, without hurting prices, thanks to soaringdemand in developing countries.   ``This is not a bad deal,'' said Gignoux.   Ian Graham, an analyst at County NatWest in London, said,``There's not the same pressure to come up with a novelcompromise.''   Terzian estimated OPEC production climbed to 23.4 millionbarrels a day last month, with big surges by Saudi Arabia, Kuwaitand the United Arab Emirates. The output was well over the cartel'sceiling of 20.5 million barrels a day for the last quarter of thisyear.   Not since the spring of 1981 has OPEC produced so much,according to figures from the International Energy Agency. Itsoutput amounted to 23.2 million barrels a day in the second quarterof that year.   Analysts say the cartel's luck may not hold next year whendemand for OPEC oil is expected to slip, due partly to seasonalfactors and saturated storage tanks.   The International Energy Agency predicted earlier this monththat demand for OPEC crude in the first half of 1990 would beslightly under 21 million barrels a day.   If so, the cartel would have to cut current output to keepprices steady.   ``The problem is ... getting production down so it doesn'toversupply the market,'' said Graham.   To do that will require hard bargaining.   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been flagrantlyviolating their quotas, the individual supply targets set by thecartel for each member, to press their demands for a larger shareof the output total.   Terzian estimated the two countries each were producing morethan 2 million barrels a day last month, about double theirproduction caps.   He said Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, liftedabout 5.6 million barrels a day in October, higher than its quotaof 5 million barrels.   Analysts believe the Saudis, as a negotiating tactic before thisweek's meetings, have decided to pump more to try to maintain theirshare of the cartel's increased production. Saudi Arabia isassigned about a quarter of the total output.   Saudi oil minister Hisham Nazer has said he would not give upany of his country's share.   At talks in Geneva in late September the ministers seriouslyconsidered an Iranian proposal to meet the demands for biggerchunks of the production pie by Kuwait and the United ArabEmirates. The ministers were expected to renew those discussionsthis week.   Under Iran's plan, the cartel's production ceiling would rise to21.5 million barrels a day to cover the requests of Kuwait and theUnited Arab Emirates for higher shares. Gabon and Ecuador alsowould get more.   Smaller shares would be parceled out to Algeria, Indonesia,Nigeria and Venezuela. Iran and Iraq also would lose a bit. SaudiArabia, Libya and Qatar would stay the same.</TEXT></DOC>
