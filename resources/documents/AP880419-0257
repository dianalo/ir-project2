(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Attention shoppers, it's time for a quickquiz.   A customer goes into a large discount store hoping to save abundle on running shoes. He finds that the prices are indeedslashed, but there are eight different kinds to choose from.   What should he do?   A. Buy the pair that looks the most sophisticated.   B. Try to find a sales clerk who may know slightly more than himabout running shoes.   C. Leave the store confused.   D. All of the above.   Consumers across the country, whether they're shopping for shoesor kitchen appliances, are coming up with all of those and otherequally unfulfilling answers.   ``You almost have to know everything there is to know about aproduct before you go into a store,'' said James Tiernan, executivedirector of the Chicago-based American Consumers Association.   Consumer frustration is one reason a tiny Rochester-basedcomputer company has introduced a curious new machine intosupermarkets around the country to help the confused, the tired andthe busy shopper.   Inter-Ad, a private firm, sells computers that can be used togive directions in the store, to print out recipes or coupons or tooffer food preparation instruction, all with a touch of a finger.   ``We've seen a trend away from the traditional homemaker totwo-career families and these are people who have less time toshop,'' said Michael Mizesko, Inter-Ad's director of marketing.``Convenience has become more important than price now and thesemachines are part of that.''   These machines and others like them may be the answer of thefuture for the baffled consumer, according to two RochesterInstitute of Technology professors, who are doing research in the``consumer computer'' field.   Having computers as sales people is something that has attractedthe attention of many large companies, said Dan Joseph and ThomasWilliams.   The idea, they say, is to program computers to analyze variousconsumer decisions _ like ``What kind of motor oil do I need?'' or``How much will these denim jeans stretch?'' _ and provide someguidance.   The professors say these so-called ``expert systems'' are goingto be popping up in all kinds of stores over the next five years.   ``People are getting tired of hearing `I don't know, I just workhere.' They don't want to be at the mercy of that kind ofsalesperson,'' said Joseph.   The two researchers are putting the finishing touches on asystem to help people choose a personal computer. They also have aprogram on the drawing board to offer advice on running shoes.   Joseph said he hopes to set up his ``expert computerconsultant'' in the school bookstore by the end of the summer andsee how it fares. Eventually, he would like to put it in computerstores around the country.   The idea of using computers to analyze problems and offer adviceis not new, but so far they have been used mostly in industrial orscientific applications.   The first system, created in the early 70s, was called Mycin andit served the medical profession offering diagnoses of variousbacterial blood infections, Joseph said. The only problem was thatit took a whole day to get one diagnosis.   Since then, however, expert systems have been greatly improvedand are used to diagnose problems in auto engines, to predict whereveins of valuable mineral deposits are, and to offer advice to oildrillers.   ``The time has come to make the jump to the consumer,'' saidJoseph.   Inter-Ad has machines in several hundred stores in 75 differentsupermarket chains in 32 states and Canada. The store directory isthe most popular model, with a cuisine machine, which offers videosof how to carve a turkey or clean a fish, found in about half asmany stores.   Last year, Inter-Ad introduced ``The Information Station'' whichcombines the two machines and also prints coupons and can be usedfor in-store advertising.   That system is being tested by the Cincinnati-based Kroger Co.,which is using it in seven stores. Other chains are also using thesystem, Mizesko said.   The machines cost from $7,000 to $12,000, he said.   Eventually, the 6-year-old Inter-Ad company that President JamesOdorczyk started in his home after resigning from Xerox Corp. hopesto use its video kiosks to serve as a national in-store advertisingnetwork.   Tiernan, the consumer advocate, warned that the potential use ofthese ``expert systems'' as advertising vehicles is the biggestdrawback they have, although he estimated that overall they wouldbe a service rather than a sales gimmick for shoppers.   ``But you still have to remember if the store manager says he'sgot an extra shipment of basil he needs to sell, you might see awhole lot of recipes calling for fresh basil,'' Tiernan said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions April 23-24</NOTE></DOC>
