(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A three-judge panel on Thursday certifiedthe election to governor of Democrat L. Douglas Wilder in a recountthat gave him a 6,741-vote margin over Republican J. MarshallColeman.   The recount confirmed Wilder as the first black elected governorin history, with 896,936 votes to 890,195 for Coleman, who pickedup 113 votes in the recount.   The first count of the Nov. 7 election gave Wilder victory by6,854 votes, or four-tenths of 1 percent of the 1.78 million votescast. Under state law, that margin was close enough for Coleman toget a recount at state expense.   The first statewide recount in Virginia was conducted Wednesdayin the state's 136 localities. The results were driven to the StateBoard of Elections.   William H. Hurd, Coleman's attorney, said the Republican wouldnot challenge the judges' decision in the General Assembly.   ``The outcome of this hard-fought contest is no longer indoubt,'' Coleman said in a prepared statement handed to reporters.   ``As an individual and as the nominee of my party, I cannot denythat it hurts to come so close and yet fall short,'' Coleman said.``But the system has worked, the people have spoken, and DougWilder deserves and will have my full support as our new governor.''   Wilder also issued a statement declaring that he ``never had anydoubt about the outcome.''   Board of Elections employees tabulated the results from eachvoting machine to get totals for each of the state's 1,967precincts and then added those figures to get a total for eachlocality. The numbers were checked by independent auditors beforebeing passed for inspection to the lawyers for Wilder and Coleman.   ``The results are an outstanding tribute to the accuracy andintegrity of the electoral process,'' said Lawrence Framme,chairman of the state Democratic Party. He said it was ``trulyamazing'' that only 113 errors were made of almost 1.8 millionvotes cast, only 113 errors were made.   The Republicans, however, said the process needs to be changedto prevent felons from registering to vote. Hurd said the Colemancamp found 3,000 to 4,000 felons on the voter rolls, and heestimated that 2,000 to 3,000 voted.   Earlier, Hurd had called the recount a ``very worthwhileproceeding as I think the results will bear out.''   Circuit Judges Melvin R. Hughes Jr. of Richmond, Robert W.Stewart of Norfolk and Herbert A. Pickford III of Charlottesvillewere present to settle any disputes and to certify the results.</TEXT></DOC>
