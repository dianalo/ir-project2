The result is used to obtain the approximate analytic expressionsshowing how the optical gain and the refractive index change with anincrease in the laser power. The index change is generally small butcan be positive or negative depending on which side of the gain peakthe lasing mode is located. By contrast, the gain is always reduced becauseof spectral hole-burning. The implications of gain saturation on thedynamic response of semiconductor lasers are discussed together withthe possibility of experimental verification.</TEXT></DOC>
