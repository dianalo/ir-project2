 The four regional holding companiesdemonstrating early-stage SMDS service capabilities at INTEROP 90's SolutionsShowcase, BellSouth, NYNEX, Pacific Bell and Southwestern Bell, have allpreviously announced SMDS service trials.andM;&quot;We believe this SMDS service demonstration illustrates that the publictelecommunications networks are moving closer to providing what sophisticatedcustomers want:  the capability to communicate over a high-speed data networkwith a standardized service available just about anywhere,&quot; said SteveStarliper, SMDS service project manager for Pacific Bell.andM;&quot;This is the first time several of the regional holding companies havepublicly demonstrated the capabilities of what is intended to become a newuniversal data communications service,&quot; said Chris Noll, SMDS servicemarketing manager at BellSouth Services.andM;&quot;By interconnecting systems, via interexchange carrier provider lines, allthe way from White Plains, N.Y., to San Ramon, Calif., and incorporatingapplications from vendors like Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems, we'reemphasizing what we believe will be a growing national commitment to SMDSservice,&quot; added Noll.andM;SMDS service is a response to a growing business need to tie together remotecomputer and communications systems.andP;  With inter-LATA SMDS servicetransmission provided by any participating interexchange carrier, the servicewill enable users to transmit data, images and graphics economically over thepublic switched network at speeds of up to 45 million bits per second.andM;Initially, however, SMDS service is being offered during the trial at 1.5megabits per second.andP;  And although a public network service, SMDS service isdesigned to offer the benefits and flexibilities of today's switched dataservices, as well as the benefits associated with private lines.andM;Through BellCommunications Research (Bellcore), the research and engineeringarm of the seven regional holding companies, SMDS service technicalrequirements are being shared with local exchange carriers, national andinternational standards organizations, interexchange carriers and foreigntelecommunications administrations.andP;  This ensures that the service willevolve in a format for a worldwide capability.andM;Network support for these applications is being provided by ATandamp;T NetworkSystems' Metropolitan Area Switching Systems and ATandamp;T Business SpecialServices' ACCUNET T1.5 long distance service.andP;  Applications in teleradiology,multimedia production, document storage and retrieval, and network managementare all being displayed interconnecting San Ramon, Calif.; White Plains, NY,Atlanta; St. Louis, MO; and Liberty Corner, NJ; with the show floor.andM;The teleradiology application illustrates how SMDS service could be appliedin the time-sensitive medical arena, facilitating crucial consultations anddiagnoses even in remote locations.andP;  SMDS service enables high-speedtransmission of high-resolution digitized images such as X-rays over thepublic network.andP;  Without the expense of dedicated private lines or networks,SMDS service permits medical images to be sent to distant locations forspecialists' evaluations almost in real-time.andM;SMDS service could improve multimedia compositions, too.andP;  As demonstratedthrough use of BBN/Slate's software package, the capability of SMDS servicefor transmitting documents, graphics and images could boost productivity andimprove product quality by allowing users in distant locations, and fromdifferent companies, to simultaneously create and edit in real-time.andM;Hewlett-Packard's AIMS System, a sophisticated document storage, filing andretrieval system, demonstrates the service's ability to allow scanning,transmission and editing of files between remote locations.andM;The SMDS service exhibit also includes a technical demonstration of twoprototype management systems that could enable users to manage SMDS serviceas if it were their own private network.andP;  NetWindow helps identify, isolateand diagnose problems in SMDS service transmissions.andP;  LANPATH Manager, inturn, is a network management tool that resides on customer premises andenables users to customize SMDS service as a feature in their overallcommunications networks.andM;Since SMDS service is based on an IEEE (Institute of Electronic andElectrical Engineers) standard protocol, any computer or communicationssystems vendor may build an interface to interoperate with the service.andO;Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and cisco Systems Inc. with Kentrox Corp.andO;are exhibiting prototype interfaces to their systems.andP;  Real-time, high-speedimage and graphic transfer for interactive computing is being shown by SunMicrosystems.andM;Numerous other computer, software and communications systems vendors areparticipating in the SMDS service demonstration.andP;  These include BBN SoftwareProducts Corp., Cornerstone Technologies Inc., Andersen Consulting andMedical Imaging Systems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
