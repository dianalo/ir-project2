(atthat time, the Armak Co.), 300 South Wacker Dr., Chicago, IL 60606, proposingthat andSection; 176.180 <T3>Components of paper and paperboard in contact with dry food </T3>(21CFR 176.180) be amended to provide for the safe use of an anionic polyurethane,produced by reacting the preliminary adduct formed from the reaction ofglyceryl monostearate and toluenediisocyanate with not more than 10 molepercent N-methyldiethanolamine and not less than 90 mole percent dimethylolpropionicacid. In another notice, published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of April 12, 1983 (48 FR 15716), FDA announcedthat a petition (FAP 8B3370) had been filed by Akzo Chemicals, Inc. (atthat time, the Armak Co.), proposing that andSection; 176.170 <T3>Components of paper and paperboard in contact with aqueous and fattyfoods </T3>(21 CFR 176.170) be amended to provide for the safe use of ananionic polyurethane, produced by reacting the preliminary adduct formedfrom the reaction of glyceryl monostearate and toluenediisocyanate witha mixture of <T3>N</T3>-methyldiethanolamine and dimethylolpropionic acid. FDA notes that although the petitioner's description of the productionof the polyurethane additive varies slightly between these filing notices,the additive is, in both cases, produced by reacting the preliminary adductformed from the reaction of glyceryl monostearate and toluenediisocyanatewith not more than 10 mole percent <T3>N</T3>-methyldiethanolamine and not less than 90 mole percent dimethylolpropionicacid. Both petitions also request use of the additive as a sizing agentin the manufacture of paper and paperboard. The agency has therefore combinedits review of these petitions in this final rule. FDA also notes that itis unnecessary to list this additive in andSection; 176.180 because use ofthe additive in andSection; 176.170 authorizes its use by cross-referencefor the conditions of use in andSection; 176.180. FDA in its evaluation of the safety of this additive has reviewed the safetyof both the additive and the starting materials used to manufacture theadditive. Although the polyurethane additive itself has not been foundto cause cancer, it has been found to contain minute amounts of 2,4-toluenediamineand dibutyltin diacetate as byproducts of its production. These impuritieshave been shown to cause cancer in test animals and may be expected tobe present at very low levels in the additive. Residual amounts of reactantsand manufacturing aids, such as toluenediamine and dibutyltin diacetate,are commonly found as contaminants in chemical products, including foodadditives.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Determination of Safety </ITAG>Under section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act(the Act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)), the so-called ``general safety clause''of the statute, a food additive cannot be approved for a particular useunless a fair evaluation of the data available to FDA establishes thatthe additive is safe for that use. The concept of safety embodied in theFood Additives Amendment of 1958 is explained in the legislative historyof the provision: ``Safety requires proof of a reasonable certalnty thatno harm will result from the proposed use of an additive. It does not_andcannot_require proof beyond any possible doubt that no harm will resultunder any conceivable circumstance.'' (H. Rept. 2284, 85th Cong., 2d Sess.4 (1958)). This definition of safety has been incorporated into FDA's foodadditive regulations (21 CFR 170.3(i)). The anticancer or Delaney clauseof the Food Additives Amendment (section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Act (21 U.S.C.348 (c)(3)(A))) provides further that no food additive shall be deemedto be safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal.In the past, FDA has often refused to approve the use of an additive thatcontained or was suspected of containing even minor amounts of a carcinogenicchemical, even though the additive as a whole had not been shown to causecancer. The agency now believes, however, that developments in scientifictechnology and experience with risk assessment procedures make it possiblefor FDA to establish the safety of additives that contain carcinogenicchemicals but that have not themselves been shown to cause cancer. In the preamble to the final rule permanently listing Dandamp;C Green No.6, published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of April 2, 1982 (47 FR 14138), FDA explainedthe basis for approving the use of a color additive that had not been shownto cause cancer, even though it contains a carcinogenic impurity. Sincethat decision,  FDA has approved the use of other color additives and foodadditives on the same basis. An additive that has not been shown to causecancer but that contains a carcinogenic impurity may properly be evaluatedunder the general safety clause of the statute using risk assessment proceduresto determine whether there is a reasonable certainty that no harm willresult from the proposed use of the additive. The agency's position is supported by<T3> Scott</T3> v.<T3> FDA,</T3> 728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984). That case involved a challengeto FDA's decision to approve the use of Dandamp;C Green No. 5, which containsa carcinogenic chemical but has itself not been shown to cause cancer.Relying heavily on the reasoning in the agency's decision to list thiscolor additive, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitrejected the challenge to FDA's action and affirmed the listing regulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Safety of Petitioned Use </ITAG>FDA estimated the daily intake of the polyurethane produced by reactingthe preliminary adduct formed from the reaction of glyceryl monostearateand toluenediisocyanate with a mixture of<T3> N</T3>-methyldiethanolamine and dimethylolpropionic acid on the basisof several factors, including the migration of the additive under the mostsevere intended conditions of use and the probable concentration of theadditive in the daily diet from food-contact articles that contain thissubstance. The estimated daily dietary exposure to the polyurethane lowmolecular weight fractions of the additive that are expected to migrateto food is 6.8 micrograms per day (2.3 parts per billion in the diet) fora 60-kilogram person. FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic testing to be necessary to determinethe safety of an additive whose use will result in such low exposure levels(Refs. 1 and 2), and the agency has not required such testing here. However,the agency has reviewed available data from acute toxicity studies andsubchronic studies on the additive. No adverse effects were reported inthese studies. Because the polyurethane produced by reacting the preliminaryadduct formed from the reaction of glyceryl monostearate and toluenediisocyanatewith a mixture of <T3>N</T3>-methyldiethanolamine and dimethylolpropionic acid has not beenshown to cause cancer, the anticancer clause does not apply to it. However,FDA has evaluated the safety of this additive under the general safetyclause, considering all available data and using risk assessment proceduresto estimate the upper bound limit of risk presented by the carcinogenicchemicals that may be present as impurities in the additive. Based on thisevaluation, the agency has concluded that the additive is safe under theproposed conditions of use. The risk assessment procedures that FDA used in this evaluation are similarto the methods that the agency has used to examine the risk associatedwith the presence of minor carcinogenic impurities in various other foodand color additives that contain carcinogenic impurities (see, e.g., 49FR 13018 and 13019; April 2, 1984). This risk evaluation of the carcinogenicimpurities has two aspects: (1) Assessment of the worst-case exposure tothe impurities from the proposed use of the additive; and (2) extrapolationof the risk observed in the animal bioassays to the conditions of probableexposure for humans. A. 2,4-Toluenediamine Although 2,4-toluenediisocyanate is one of the starting materials usedin the manufacture of the polyurethane sizing agent, any unreacted 2,4-toluenediisocyanatewould be hydrolyzed to 2,4-toluenediamine. Therefore, the agency's riskassessment was carried out only for 2,4-toluenediamine. Based on the fraction of the daily diet that may be in contact with surfacescontaining the additive, as well as the level of 2,4-toluenediamine thatmay be present in the additive, FDA estimated the hypothetical worst-caseexposure to 2,4-toluenediamine from the use of the additive in paper andpaperboard to be 0.0038 parts per billion in the diet or 11.4 nanogramsper person per day (Ref. 3). The agency used data from a National CancerInstitute (NCI) carcinogenesis bioassay (Ref. 4) on 2,4-toluenediaminefed to Fischer 344 rats and hybrid B6C3F1 mice to estimate the upper boundlevel of lifetime human risk from exposure to this chemical stemming fromthe proposed use of this polyurethane. The results of the bioassay demonstratedthat the material was carcinogenic for female rats under the conditionsof the study, inducing neoplasms of the liver and mammary gland.FDA reviewed the bioassay and other relevant data available in the literatureand concluded that the findings of carcinogenicity were supported by thisinformation on 2,4-toluenediamine. The agency further concluded that anestimate of the upper bound level of lifetime human risk from potentialexposure to 2,4-toluenediamine stemming from the proposed use of the polyurethanecould be calculated from the bioassay. The agency used a quantitative riskassessment procedure (linear proportional model) to extrapolate from thedose used in the animal experiment to the very low doses encountered underthe proposed conditions of use. This procedure is not likely to underestimatethe actual risk from very low doses and may, in fact, exaggerate it becausethe extrapolation models used are designed to estimate the maximum riskconsistent with the data. For this reason the estimate can be used withconfidence to determine, to a reasonable certainty, whether any harm willresult from the proposed conditions and levels of use of the food additives.Based on a worst-case exposure of 11.4 nanograms per person per day, FDAestimates that the upper bound limit of individual lifetime risk from thepotential exposure to 2,4-toluenediamine resulting from the use of theadditive is 4andmultiply;10^8, or less than 1 in 25 million (Ref. 5). Becauseof numerous conservatisms in the exposure estimate, lifetime averaged individualexposure to 2,4-toluenediamine is expected to be substantially less thanthe estimated daily intake. Therefore, the calculated upper bound limitof risk would be less. Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonablecertainty of no harm from the exposure to 2,4-toluenediamine that mightresult from the proposed use of the additive. B. Dibutyltin Diacetate Based on the fraction of the daily diet that may be in contact with surfacescontaining the additive, as well as the level of dibutyltin diacetate thatmay be present in the additive (Ref. 3), FDA also estimated the hypotheticalworst-case exposure to dibutyltin diacetate from the use of this additiveto be 0.0023 parts per trillion in the diet, or 0.069 nanograms per personper day. The agency used data in an NCI carcinogenesis bioassay on dibutyltindiacetate in which dibutyltin diacetate was fed to rats and mice (Ref.6) to estimate the upper bound level of lifetime human risk from exposureto this chemical, stemming from the proposed use of this additive. Theresults of the bioassay on dibutyltin diacetate were found by FDA, in itsreview in 1979, to demonstrate that the material was carcinogenic for maleand female mice under the conditions of the study. The test material causedan increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas of both male and femalemouse livers. The agency recently reevaluated this bioassay and concluded that the availableinformation on dibutyltin diacetate supports the agency's finding in 1979of the carcinogenicity of this substance (Ref. 7). The agency further concludedthat the NCI bioassay provided the appropriate basis on which to calculatean estimate of the upper bound limit of lifetime risk from potential exposureto dibutyltin diacetate stemming from the proposed use of the additive.Based on a worst-case exposure of 0.069 nanograms per person per day, FDAestimates, using a linear proportional model, that the upper bound limitof individual lifetime risk from potential exposure to dibutyltin diacetatefrom the use of the polyurethane resin is 1.6andmultiply;10^11, or less than2 in 100 billion (Ref. 5). Because of numerous conservatisms in the exposureestimate, lifetime averaged individual exposure to dibutyltin diacetateis expected to be substantially less than the estimated daily intake. Therefore,the calculated upper bound risk would be less. Thus, the agency concludesthat there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from the exposure to dibutyltindiacetate that might result from the proposed use of the additive. C. Needs for Specifications The agency has also considered whether specifications are necessary tocontrol the amounts of dibutyltin diacetate and 2,4-toluenediamine in theresin. The agency finds that specifications are not necessary for the followingreasons: (1) Because of the low levels at which dibutyltin diacetate and2,4-toluenediamine may be expected to remain as impurities following productionof the additive, the agency would not expect these impurities to becomecomponents of food at other than extremely small levels; and (2) the upperbound limit of lifetime risk from exposure to these impurities, even underworst-case assumptions, is very low, less than 2 in 100 billion for dibutyltindiacetate and less than 1 in 25 million for 2,4-toluenediamine. D. Conclusion on Safety FDA has evaluated the data in the petition and other relevant materialand concludes that the proposed food additive use is safe, and that theregulation should be amended as set forth below. In accordance with andSection; 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition andthe documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decisionto approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center forFood Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contactperson listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h), the agency will deletefrom the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosurebefore making the documents available for inspection.The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effectsof this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significantimpact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statementis not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and theevidence supporting that finding may be seen in the Dockets ManagementBranch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.Under FDA's regulations implementing the National Environmental PolicyAct (21 CFR Part 25), an action of this type would require an abbreviatedenvironmental assessment under 21 CFR 25.31a(b)(1).<ITAG tagnum="84">III.
