Olson has undergone surgery for colon cancer andwill be absent from day-to-day management for an indefinite period.   Analysts said Olson's forceful style of management has set thecompany moving in the right direction, although some were concernedthat an extended absence could be harmful.   ATandamp;T confirmed newspaper reports Tuesday that Olson, 62,underwent surgery March 25 to remove a malignant tumor from hiscolon and was recuperating at his New Jersey home while receivingoutpatient chemotherapy.   ATandamp;T's stock rose 25 cents a share to $28.12{ in New York StockExchange composite trading.   Fulton Holmes, an analyst at Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.,said he was more pessimistic than other observers about ATandamp;T'sprospects without Olson at the helm.   ``He has essentially single-handedly turned this companyaround,'' Holmes said. ``I have major reservations about thiscompany if he ends up having to either lessen his input or turn itover totally to his successor.''   ATandamp;T said it could not predict when Olson would return to activeduty or whether he would attend the company's annual meeting inDenver next Wednesday.   Robert E. Allen, 52, the president and chief operating officer,is running the company in his absence.   Olson has made ATandamp;T more aggressive, more cost-conscious andmore certain of its direction since taking office in September1986, analysts said.   Olson landed his first job in the Bell System at age 17,cleaning silt out of manholes in North Dakota, and is considered atake-charge executive with an emphasis on getting results.   ``I think Olson's personality has begun to permeate throughoutATandamp;T's organization,'' said Jack Grubman, an analyst forPaineWebber Inc.   Olson's undisclosed illness was reminiscent of that of WilliamMcGowan, the chairman of MCI Communications Corp., who suffered aheart attack in December 1986, received a heart transplant andreturned to office in September 1987.   Both companies drew criticism for failing to announce theirchiefs' illnesses until news leaked out to the press.   The New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported Olson wasill in their Tuesday editions.   ATandamp;T spokesman Bill Mullane, who confirmed Olson's illness whenasked about the reports, said lawyers assured him the matter didnot need to be disclosed because it was not considered ``material''under the law.   Mullane said Olson has kept up some correspondence from his homeand would be available in case of a crisis.   ``If there was a critical issue that had to be discussed withhim today, it would be discussed with him just as if he were inFiji on vacation,'' Mullane said.   Securities and Exchange Commission spokesman Chiles Larson saidthe illness of a chief executive is not specified as a matter thatautomatically requires disclosure. He declined to comment Tuesdayon whether the SEC was investigating the appropriateness of ATandamp;T'sactions.   The absence of Olson is less significant to ATandamp;T than McGowan'sabsence was to MCI, the distant second-place contender in thelong-distance communications market, said Daniel Rosenbaum,executive editor of Wiretap, a Morristown, N.J.-based newsletter.   ``ATandamp;T is a much more mature company. It has executives in placewho can pick up the slack,'' Rosenbaum said.</TEXT></DOC>
