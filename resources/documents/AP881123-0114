Nov. 22   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on remembering JFK:   John F. Kennedy died 25 years ago today, shot down in a motorcadein Dallas. The nation mourned; it does still.   In the last few years, it has been fashionable to tarnishKennedy's accomplishments; even his reputation has been tainted,rightly or not. But, for now, let us remember the good of our 35thpresident.   Kennedy personified a young, idealistic America with a missionnot only to improve the lot of Americans but the state of the world.   He inspired thousands of Americans to take up his call for publicservice (``... ask what you can do for your country'') through thePeace Corps and elsewhere. He began the federal government's majorpush on civil rights. He pledged that the United States would have aman on the moon by the end of the 1960s. ...   Let us remember these things as we mark this sad anniversary.</TEXT><TEXT>   Nov. 18   The Journal, Lorain, Ohio, on Christmas cards for Terry Anderson:   What a noble undertaking, this sending of Christmas cards toTerry Anderson, who is being held hostage by fanatics somewhere inthe Middle East, probably Lebanon.   The idea, the essence of the Christmas spirit, originated withLorain's Free Terry Anderson Committee. It is intended to share alittle holiday cheer and remind Anderson _ and his captors _ that heis not forsaken by the folks in his old hometown and Lorain County....   Once received, the cards will be boxed and given to U.S. Rep. DonPease, D-Oberlin, who has arranged with the U.S. State Department tohave the cards delivered to Anderson's captors.   All Christmas cards for Anderson must be received by Dec. 8 toensure they reach him by Christmas. The cards should be mailed to:Terry Anderson, c@o Free Terry Anderson Committee, P.O. Box 391,Lorain, Ohio, 44052. ...   Anderson, the Mideast bureau chief for The Associated Press, hasbeen held captive for 1,343 days, longer than any of the hostages....   There is no role this community can play in securing Anderson'srelease, except to hope and to continue praying for his safety incaptivity and his eventual release. The Christmas cards willreassure Anderson that he is not forgotten.</TEXT><TEXT>   Nov. 21   San Antonio Express-News on taming the Internal Revenue Service:   When President Reagan signed Congress' latest tax bill, he gavelife to something new, overdue and welcome: a Taxpayers Bill ofRights.   Under the bill of rights, many taxpayers no longer will be hitwith additional taxes or penalties if they relied on erroneouswritten advice by the IRS.   The bill permits the taxpayers to sue the IRS for wrongfultreatment and, if succesful, to collect damages and reimbursementfor legal and accounting fees.   And, most important, the IRS will have to stop its hated practiceof seizing bank accounts and other property on 10 days' notice. Thenotice period is tripled to 30 days.</TEXT><TEXT>   Nov. 18   Journal-World, Lawrence, Kan., on education cheating:   Education officials in California have uncovered incidents datingto 1985 in which school personnel in 45 public elementary schoolschanged answers on standardized state tests that measure a school'sprogress in reading, writing and mathematics. ...   State officials said the apparent motive was to raise theschools' overall score, which could entitle it to more state funds....   We can't be naive enough to believe that California is the onlystate where such finagling has occurred.   How many other areas have had similar situations which haveencouraged the kind of educational mediocrity leading to a growingnumber of illiterates and ill-prepared graduates?</TEXT><TEXT>   Nov. 18   The Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times on the National Rifle Associationvote:   The National Rifle Association is widely viewed as the originalunstoppable force in U.S. politics, mostly, we suppose, because ithas rarely run into an immovable object.   At least not until recently, when the Maryland electorateasserted itself and rejected attempts to repeal a recently enactedhandgun control law.   Polls have consistently shown that a majority of Americansapprove of a form of gun control, including registration.   Nevertheless, the NRA has had remarkable success in defeating allbut bare minimum regulations.   Its job has been made easier, of course, by picking up the votesof lawmakers, especially those who receive NRA campaigncontributions.   Perhaps the outcome in Maryland will persuade legislators inother states and on Capitol Hill that a sound, common sense law doesnot have to be trashed just because it draws fire from the NRA.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
