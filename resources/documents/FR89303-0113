See 53FR 15532-36 (April 29, 1988). The Commission is now considering a numberof further amendments and additions to the sentencing guidelines, policystatements and commentary. These proposals, or a synopsis of issues tobe addressed, are set forth below. The Commission may report these andother regular amendments to the Congress on or before May 1, 1989. Alternatively,or additionally, the Commission may elect to promulgate as temporary amendmentscertain of these proposals pertaining to changes in law enacted by the100th Congress. Public comment is sought on all proposals, alternativeproposals, and any other aspect of the sentencing guidelines, policy statementsand commentary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES:</T2> Public comment should be received by the Commission nolater than April 14, 1989, in order for it to be considered by the Commissionin the promulgation of the next set of regular amendments due to the Congressby May 1, 1989.

Martin, CommunicationsDirector, Telephone: (202) 662-8800.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> The United States Sentencing Commissionis an independent agency in the judicial branch of the U.S. Government.The Commission is empowered by 28 U.S.C. 994(a) to promulgate sentencingguidelines and policy statements for Federal sentencing courts. The statutefurther directs the Commission to periodically review and revise guidelinespreviously promulgated and authorizes it to submit guideline amendmentsto the Congress no later than the first day of May each year. See 28 U.S.C.994 (o), (p).Ordinarily, the Administrative Procedure Act rulemaking requirements areinapplicable to judicial agencies; however, 28 U.S.C. 994(x) makes theAdministrative Procedure Act rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553 applicableto the promulgation of sentencing guidelines by the Commission. <ITAG tagnum="84">Consideration of Promulgation of Certain Amendments as Temporary </ITAG>The Commission has limited authority under section 21(a) of the SentencingAct of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-182, Dec. 7, 1987) to adopt temporary guidelinesor amendments when the Congress creates new offenses or amends existingcriminal statutes. A number of the amendments proposed below are in responseto enactments of the 100th Congress, such as the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of1988 (Pub. L. 100-690, Nov. 18, 1988). If the Commission elects to exerciseits section 21(a) temporary guideline promulgation authority, it couldput into effect some or all amendments implementing recently enacted legislationprior to the expiration of the 180-day period of Congressional review thatapplies to all regular amendments promulgated under 28 U.S.C. 994(p). Ifit follows that course of action, the Commission could simultaneously submitthe amendments to the Congress as regular amendments. The Commission specificallyinvites comment on which, if any, of the proposals below should be promulgatedas temporary guidelines under the authority of section 21(a) of the 1987Sentencing Reform Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Format of Proposed Amendments </ITAG>Proposed amendments are presented sequentially by section of the GuidelinesManual to which they pertain. A cross reference note is provided for amendmentsthat affect more than one section of the Guidelines. Each amendment isfollowed by a statement explaining the reason for the amendment. For someproposals, additional explanatory material is provided immediately followingthe statement of purpose. The proposed amendments are presented in three formats. First, the majorityof the amendments are proposed as specific changes in a guideline, policystatement or commentary. Secondly, for some amendments the Commission haspublished alternative means of addressing an issue. Commentators are encouragedto state their preference among listed alternatives or to suggest a newalternative. Thirdly, the Commission has highlighted certain issues (generallyrelating to recently enacted legislation) and invites suggestions for specificamendment language. To help focus comment, one or more proposals are presentedas examples for some of these issues.<ITAG tagnum="84">Amendments of Special Note </ITAG>The Commission has not attempted to categorize proposed amendments as substantivechanges in policy or merely technical or clarifying in nature. Certainamendments, however, are in the Commission's opinion of particular significancein terms of their potential policy impact and/or because of the Commission'sdesire for public comment on identified issues, alternative proposals,or illustrative solutions. These amendments of special note are: 50 (Robbery),96 (Continuing Criminal Enterprise), 119 (Fraud and Deceit), 243 (CareerOffender), 247 (Chapter Five, Part A_Sentencing Table), and 260 (Home Detention).<ITAG tagnum="84">Availability of Supporting Data</ITAG>With respect to proposed amendment 50, pertaining to the guideline forrobbery, amendment 119, pertaining to the guideline for certain fraud offenses,and amendment 243, pertaining to the ``career offender'' guidelines, theCommission is preparing reports summarizing and analyzing pertinent sentencingdata. Prior to the April 7, 1989, public hearing, the Commission expectsto have these reports available in preliminary form at its offices forreview by interested persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Public Comment </ITAG>While the amendments below are specifically proposed for public commentand possible submission to the Congress by May 1, 1989, the Commissionemphasizes that it welcomes comment on any aspect of the sentencing guidelines,policy statements, and commentary, whether or not the subject of a proposedamendment. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), the Commission is directed toperiodically ``review and revise (the Guidelines), in consideration ofcomments and data coming to its attention.'' The same statutory provisionfurther directs specific institutional representatives and groups withinthe Federal criminal justice system to submit to the Commission at leastannually a written report that may suggest ``changes in the guidelinesthat appear to be warranted.'' The Commission invites any of the institutionalgroups listed in section 994(o) who have not previously submitted a reportto the Commission to make such a report in conjunction with this solicitationof public comment.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>28 U.S.C. 994 (a), (o), (p), (x); section 21(a) ofthe Sentencing Act of 1987 (Pub.

Wilkins, Jr.,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4"> Chairman.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84"> Chapter One, Part A, Section 4(b) Departures</ITAG>1. <T3> Proposed Amendment:</T3> Chapter 1, Part A (4)(b) is amended in thefirst sentence by deleting ``* * * that was'' and inserting in lieu thereof``of a kind, or to a degree,''.<T3> Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purpose of this amendment is to conformthe quotation to the statute, as amended by section 3 of the SentencingAct of 1987.2. <T3>Proposed Amendment:</T3> Chapter One, Part A, section 4(b) is amendedin the second sentence of the last paragraph by deleting ``Part H'' andinserting in lieu thereof ``Part K (Departures)'', and in the third sentenceof the last paragraph by deleting ``Part H'' and inserting in lieu thereof``Part K''.<T3> Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purpose of this amendment is to correcta clerical error. 3.<T3> Proposed Amendment:</T3> Chapter One, Part A, section 4(b) is amendedin the first sentence of the fourth paragraph by deleting ``three'' andinserting in lieu thereof ``two''; in the fourth paragraph by deleting:``The first kind, which will most frequently be used, is in effect an interpolationbetween two adjacent, numerically oriented guideline rules. A specificoffense characteristic, for example, might require an increase of fourlevels for serious bodily injury but two levels for bodily injury. Ratherthan requiring a court to force middle instances into either the ``serious''or the ``simple'' category, the guideline commentary suggests that thecourt may interpolate and select a midpoint increase of three levels. TheCommission has decided to call such an interpolation a ``departure'' inlight of the legal views that a guideline providing for a range of increasesin offense levels may violate the statute's 25 percent rule (though otherhave presented contrary legal arguments). Since interpolations are technicallydepartures, the courts will have to provide reasons for their selection,and it will be subject to review for ``reasonableness'' on appeal. TheCommission believes, however, that a simple reference by the court to the``mid-category'' nature of the facts will typically provide sufficientreason. It does not foresee serious practical problems arising out of theapplication of the appeal provisions to this form of departure.''; in thefirst sentence of the fifth paragraph by deleting ``second'' and insertingin lieu thereof ``first''; and, in the first sentence of the sixth paragraphby deleting ``third'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``second''.<T3> Reason for Amendment:</T3> This amendment eliminates references todeparture by interpolation from Chapter One of the Guidelines Manual. Relatedamendments: 17 (andSection; 2A2.1); 19 (andSection; 2A2.2); 25 (andSection; 2A3.1);29 (andSection; 2A4.1); 51 (andSection; 2B3.1); 54 (andSection; 2B3.2); and 108(andSection; 2E2.1).<T3> Additional Explanatory Statement:</T3> The Commission has reviewedthe discussion of interpolation in Chapter One, which has been read asdescribing ``interpolation'' as a departure from an offense level ratherfrom the guideline range established after the determination of an offenselevel. The Commission concluded that it is simpler to add intermediateoffense level adjustments to the guidelines in the cases where interpolationis most likely to be considered (i.e., degree of bodily injury). This amendmentis not intended to preclude interpolation in other cases; where appropriate,the court will be able to achieve the same result by use of the regulardeparture provisions.<T3>andSection; 1B1.1 Application Instructions</T3> 4.<T3> Proposed Amendment:</T3> Section 1B1.1(a) is amended by deleting ``guidelinesection in Chapter Two most applicable to the statute of conviction'' andinserting in lieu thereof ``applicable offense guideline section from ChapterTwo'', and by deleting: ``If more than one guideline is referenced forthe particular statute, select the guideline most appropriate for the conductof which the defendant was convicted.''.<T3> Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purpose of this amendment is to clarifythe guideline and conform the language to andSection; 1B1.2. 5.<T3> Proposed Amendment:</T3> Section 1B1.1(e) is amended by deleting immediatelyfollowing the period at the end of the first sentence: ``The resultingoffense level is the total offense level.''. Section 1B1.1(g) is amended by deleting ``total'', and by inserting ``determinedabove'' immediately following ``category''.<T3> Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purpose of this amendment is to clarifythe guideline. The last sentence of andSection; 1B1.1(e) and the use of ``totaloffense level'' in andSection; 1B1.1(g) combine to produce a technicallyinaccurate instruction. It is not the total offense level of subsection(e), but rather that level as adjusted by any offense level adjustmentsfrom Chapter Four, Part B (see subsection (f)) that is used in subsection(g). 6.<T3> Proposed Amendment:</T3> The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.1 captioned``Application Notes'' is amended in Note l(c) by deleting ``firearm orother dangerous weapon'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``dangerous weapon(including a firearm)''. The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.1 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amendedin Note 1(g) is amended by deleting ``firearm or other dangerous weapon''wherever it appears and inserting in lieu thereof ``dangerous weapon (includinga firearm)''.<T3> Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purpose of this amendment is to clarifythe Commentary. Related amendment: 16 (andSection; 2A2.1).7. <T3>Proposed Amendment:</T3> The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.1 captioned``Application Notes'' is amended by inserting as an additional note thefollowing:<ITAG tagnum="21">``5. In the case of a defendant subject to a sentence enhancementunder 18 U.S.C. 3147 (Penalty for an Offense Committed While on Release),see andSection; 2J1.7 (Commission of Offense While on Release).''.</ITAG><T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> To clarify the treatment of a specific enhancementprovision.andSection; 1B1.2 Applicable Guidelines8.<T3> Proposed Amendment:</T3> Section 1B1.2(a) is amended in the firstsentence by deleting ``The court shall apply'' and inserting in lieu thereof``Determine''; and in the second sentence by deleting ``the court shallapply'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``determine'', and by deleting ``guidelinein such chapter'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``offense guideline sectionin Chapter Two''.<T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purposes of this amendment are to clarifythe guideline and to make the phraseology of this subsection more consistentwith that of andSection;andSection; 1B1.1 and 1B1.2(b).9.<T3> Proposed Amendment:</T3> Section 1B1.2(a) is amended in the firstsentence by inserting immediately before the period ``(i.e., the offenseconduct charged in the count of the indictment or information of whichthe defendant was convicted)''.The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.2 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amendedin Note 1 by deleting the second and third sentences of the first paragraphand inserting in lieu thereof the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">``As a general rule, the court is to use the guideline section fromChapter Two most applicable to the offense of conviction. The StatutoryIndex (Appendix A) provides a listing to assist in this determination.When a particular statute proscribes only a single type of criminal conduct,the offense of conviction and the conduct proscribed by the statute willcoincide, and there will be only one offense guideline referenced. Whena particular statute proscribes a variety of conduct that might constitutethe subject of different offense guidelines, the court will determine whichguideline section applies based upon the nature of the offense conductcharged in the count of which the defendant was convicted.''.</ITAG><T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purpose of this amendment is to clarifythe guideline and Commentary.10.<T3> Proposed Amendment:</T3> Section 1B1.2(a) is amended by deleting:``Similarly, stipulations to additional offenses are treated as if thedefendant had been convicted of separate counts charging those offenses.'',</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">and by inserting the following additional subsections:``(c) A conviction by a plea of guilty or nolo contendere containing astipulation that specifically establishes the commission of additionaloffense(s) shall be treated as if the defendant had been convicted of additionalcount(s) charging those offense(s).``(d) A conviction on a count charging a conspiracy to commit more thanone offense shall be treated as if the defendant had been convicted ona separate count of conspiracy for each offense that the defendant conspiredto commit.''.The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.2 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amendedin the second paragraph of Note 1 by deleting:<ITAG tagnum="21">``Similarly, if the defendant pleads guilty to one robbery but admitsthe elements of two additional robberies as part of a plea agreement, theguideline applicable to three robberies is to be applied.'',</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">and by inserting as additional Notes the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">``4. Subsections (c) and (d) address circumstances in which the provisionsof Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) are to be applied although theremay be only one count of conviction. Subsection (c) provides that in thecase of a stipulation to the commission of additional offense(s), the guidelinesare to be applied as if the defendant had been convicted of an additionalcount for each of the offenses stipulated. For example, if the defendantis convicted of one count of robbery but, as part of a plea agreement,admits to having committed two additional robberies, the guidelines areto be applied as if the defendant had been convicted of three counts ofrobbery. Subsection (d) provides that a conviction on a conspiracy countcharging conspiracy to commit more than one offense is treated as if thedefendant had been convicted of a separate conspiracy count for each offensethat he conspired to commit. For example, where a conviction on a singlecount of conspiracy establishes that the defendant conspired to committhree robberies, the guidelines are to be applied as if the defendant hadbeen convicted on one count of conspiracy to commit the first robbery,one count of conspiracy to commit the second robbery, and one count ofconspiracy to commit the third robbery.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Particular care must be taken in applying subsection (d) becausethere are cases in which the jury's verdict does not establish which offense[s]was the object of the conspiracy. In such cases, subsection (d) shouldonly be applied with respect to an object offense alleged in the conspiracycount if the court, were it sitting as a trier of fact, would convict thedefendant of conspiring to commit that object offense. For example, ifthe defendant is convicted of a conspiracy count alleging that he conspiredto commit two bank robberies, but there is insufficient evidence to supporta separate conviction for conspiracy to commit one of the robberies, thecourt shall apply the guidelines as though the defendant had been convictedof a single count of conspiracy to commit one bank robbery. Note, however,if the object offenses specified in the conspiracy count would be groupedtogether under andSection; 3D1.2(d) (e.g., a conspiracy to steal three governmentchecks) it is not necessary to engage in the foregoing analysis, becauseandSection; 1B1.3(a)(2) governs consideration of the defendant's conduct.''.</ITAG><T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> This amendment creates a new subsection(subsection (d)) to specify that a conviction of conspiracy to commit morethan one offense is treated as if the defendant had been convicted of aseparate conspiracy count for each offense that the defendant conspiredto commit. The current instruction found only at Application Note 9 ofandSection; 3D1.2 is inadequate. For consistency, material now containedat andSection; 1B1.2 (a) concerning stipulations to having committed additionaloffenses is moved to a new subsection (subsection (c)).There are cases in which the jury's verdict does not specify how many orwhich offenses were the object of the conspiracy of which the defendantwas convicted. Additional commentary (Application Note 5) is provided toaddress the treatment of such cases. Related amendment: 230 (andSection;3D1.2).<T3>Additional Explanatory Statement:</T3> In general, the offense levelfor conspiracy is determined by reference to the offense that was the objectof the conspiracy. See andSection; 2D1.4; andSection; 2X1.1. A complicationarises if a single conspiracy count alleges more than one object offense.Currently, the only guidance for this situation is found at ApplicationNote 9 of andSection; 3D1.2. That commentary instructs the court to ``treatthe conspiracy count as if it were several counts, each charging conspiracyto commit one of the substantive offenses.'' This amendment upgrades thatinstruction from commentary to a guideline and places it in a more prominentposition in the guidelines. For consistency, material now contained atandSection; 1B1.2(a) concerning stipulations is moved to new subsection (c).Additional commentary (Application Note 5) is provided to address casesin which the jury's verdict does not specify how many or which offenseswere the object of the conspiracy of which the defendant was convicted.Compare <T3>U.S. </T3>v. <T3>Johnson,</T3> 713 F.2d 633, 645-46 (11th Cir. 1983) (conviction standsif there is sufficient proof with respect to any one of the objectives),with <T3>U.S. </T3>v. <T3>Tarnopol,</T3> 561 F.2d 466 (3d Cir. 1977) (failure of proof with respectto any one of the objectives renders the conspiracy conviction invalid).In a circuit in which a multiple-objective conspiracy conviction does notconstitute a finding that the defendant conspired to commit each objective,a guideline requiring courts to treat a multiple-objective conspiracy convictionas though the defendant had been convicted of separate conspiracies tocommit each objective is unreasonable. In such cases, courts may chooseto employ a special verdict procedure to ascertain the basis of the conviction.Alternatively, judicial fact-finding must be employed when the jury's verdictdoes not determine which objectives the defendant conspired to commit.In order to maintain consistency with other andSection; 1B1.2(a) determinations,it appears that this decision should be governed by a reasonable doubtstandard. The determination that a defendant conspired to accomplish aparticular criminal objective is unlike the mere enhancement of a sentencebecause of the presence of a sentencing factor. Rather, it is the equivalentof a jury's determination that the defendant engaged in a separate crimefor which he may be punished. A higher standard of proof should governthe creation of what is, in effect, a new count of conviction. Because the guidelines do not explicitly establish standards of proof,the proposed new application note calls upon the court to determine whichoffense[s] was the object of the conspiracy as if it were ``sitting asa trier of fact.''andSection; 1B1.3 Relevant Conduct (Factors that Determine the GuidelineRange) 11.<T3> Proposed Amendment:</T3> Section 1B1.3 is amended by deleting:<ITAG tagnum="21">``The conduct that is relevant to determining the applicable guidelinerange includes that set forth below.''</ITAG>Section 1B1.3(b) is amended by deleting:<ITAG tagnum="21">``(b) Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood). Todetermine the criminal history category and the applicability of the careeroffender and criminal livelihood guidelines, the court shall consider allconduct relevant to a determination of the factors enumerated in the respectiveguidelines in Chapter Four.'',</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">and inserting in lieu thereof the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">``(b) Chapters Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood) andFive (Determining the Sentence). Factors in Chapters Four and Five thatestablish the guideline range shall be determined on the basis of the conductand information specified in the respective guidelines.''.</ITAG>The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.3 captioned ``Background'' is amended inthe second paragraph by deleting ``Chapter Four'' and inserting in lieuthereof ``Chapters Four and Five'', and by deleting ``that Chapter'' andinserting in lieu thereof ``those Chapters''. <T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purpose of this amendment is to clarifythe guideline. 12.<T3> Proposed Amendment:</T3> The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.3 captioned``Application Notes'' is amended in Note 1 by deleting:<ITAG tagnum="21">``If the conviction is for conspiracy, it includes conduct in furtheranceof the conspiracy that was known to or was reasonably foreseeable by thedefendant. If the conviction is for solicitation, misprision or accessoryafter the fact, it includes all conduct relevant to determining the offenselevel for the underlying offense that was known to or reasonably shouldhave been known by the defendant.'',</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">and inserting in lieu thereof:<ITAG tagnum="21">``If the offense was undertaken in concert with others, whether ornot charged as a conspiracy, it includes conduct of others in furtheranceof the execution of the offense that was reasonably foreseeable by thedefendant. For example, where Defendants A, B, and C engaged in a robbery,Defendant A is accountable under this guideline for an injury inflictedon a teller by Defendant B or C during the course of the robbery, evenif Defendant A did not enter the bank, because such an injury is a reasonablyforseeable result of the commission of a bank robbery. A conspiracy count,however, may be broadly worded and include the conduct of many participantsover a substantial period of time. In such cases, the scope of the offense,for the purposes of this guideline, is not necessarily the same for everyparticipant. For example, where Defendants A and B engaged in an ongoingmarihuana importation conspiracy in which Defendant C was hired to off-loada single shipment, Defendants A, B, and C may be included in a single countcharging conspiracy to import marihuana. For the purposes of determiningthe offense level under this guideline, Defendant C is accountable forthe shipment of marihuana he conspired to import and any acts or omissionsin furtherance of the importation that were reasonably forseeable. He isnot accountable for prior or subsequent shipments of marihuana importedby Defendants A or B in which he played no part and from which he was toreceive no benefit because those acts were not in furtherance of the executionof the offense that he undertook with Defendants A and B. In contrast,Defendants A and B are accountable for the marihuana imported during theentire conspiracy (which was reasonably forseeable to them) and any otheracts or omissions in furtherance of the execution of that conspiracy thatwere reasonably forseeable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``If the offense was a solicitation, misprision, or accessory afterthe fact, conduct `for which the defendant would be otherwise accountable'includes all conduct relevant to determining the offense level for theunderlying offense that was known to, or reasonably should have been knownby, the defendant.''.</ITAG><T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purpose of this amendment is to clarifythat the definition of relevant conduct excludes the conduct of other participantsthat was beyond the scope of (not in furtherance of) the jointly undertakenoffense engaged in by the defendant. At the same time, the amendment clarifiesthat this definition covers conduct of others in furtherance of a jointlyundertaken offense that was reasonably forseeable, where the convictionis for the underlying offense. andSection; 1B1.5 Interpretation of References to Other Offense Guidelines13. <T3>Proposed Amendment:</T3> andSection; 1B1.5 is amended by deleting ``adjustmentsfor'', and by inserting ``and cross references'' immediately before theperiod at the end of the sentence. The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.5 captioned ``Application Note'' is amendedin Note 1 by inserting ``and cross references'' immediately before ``aswell as the base offense level''. Reason for Amendment: The purpose ofthis amendment is to clarify the guideline and Commentary.14.<T3> Proposed Amendment:</T3> The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.5 captioned``Application Note'' is amended in Note 1 by deleting: ``If the victimwas vulnerable, the adjustment from andSection; 3A1.1 Vulnerable Victim)also would apply.''.<T3> Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purpose of this amendment is to deletean unnecessary sentence. No substantive change is made.andSection; 1B1.9 Petty Offenses 15.<T3> Proposed Amendment:</T3> Section 1B1.9 is amended in the title bydeleting ``Petty Offenses'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``Class B orC Misdemeanors and Infractions''. Section 1B1.9 is amended by deleting ``(petty offense)''. The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.9 captioned ``Application Notes is amendedin the first sentence of Note 1 by deleting ``petty offense'' and insertingin lieu thereof: ``Class B or C misdemeanor or an infraction'', in thesecond sentence of Note 1 by deleting ``A petty offense is any offensefor which the maximum sentence that may be imposed does not exceed sixmonths' imprisonment.'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``A Class B misdemeanoris any offense for which the maximum authorized term of imprisonment ismore than thirty days but not more than six months; a Class C misdemeanoris any offense for which the maximum term of imprisonment is more thanfive days but not more than thirty days; an infraction is any offense forwhich the maximum authorized term of imprisonment is not more than fivedays.'', in the first sentence of Note 2 by deleting ``petty offenses''and inserting in lieu thereof ``Class B or C misdemeanors or infractions'',in the second sentence of Note 2 by deleting ``petty'' and inserting inlieu thereof ``such'', in the third sentence of Note 2 by deleting ``pettyoffense'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction''and, in Note 3 by deleting:<ITAG tagnum="21"> ``3. All other provisions of the guidelines should be disregardedto the extent that they purport to cover petty offenses.''.</ITAG> The Commentary to andSection; 1B1.9 captioned ``Background'' is amendedby deleting:<ITAG tagnum="20"> ``voted to adopt a temporary amendment to exempt all petty offensesfrom the coverage of the guidelines. Consequently, to the extent that somepublished guidelines may appear to cover petty offenses, they should bedisregarded even if they appear in the Statutory Index'',</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"> and inserting in lieu thereof:<ITAG tagnum="20"> ``exempted all Class B and C misdemeanors and infractions from thecoverage of the guidelines''.</ITAG><T3> Reason for Amendment:</T3> Section 7089 of the Omnibus Anti-Drug AbuseAct of 1988 revises the definition of a petty offense so that it no longerexactly corresponds with a Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction. Underthe revised definition, a Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction that hasan authorized fine of more than $5,000 for an individual (or more than$10,000 for an organization) will not be a petty offense. This legislativerevision does not affect the maximum terms of imprisonment authorized.The maximum authorized term of imprisonment remains controlled by the gradeof the offense (i.e., the maximum term of imprisonment remains five daysfor an infraction, thirty days for a Class C misdemeanor, and six monthsfor a Class B misdemeanor). Because the statutory grade of the offense(i.e., a Class B or C misdemeanor or an infraction) is the more relevantdefinition for guideline purposes, this amendment deletes the referencesin andSection; 1B1.9 to ``petty offenses'' and in lieu thereof inserts referencesto ``Class B and C misdemeanors and infractions.''

Alternative base offense levels are provided to take accountof the different means used to commit the offense. Enhancements are providedfor victimizing children or minors. The enhancement under subsection (b)(2)does not apply, however, where the base offense level is determined undersubsection (a)(3) because an element of the offense to which that offenselevel applies is that the victim had attained the age of twelve years buthad not attained the age of sixteen years.''.</ITAG><T3>Reason for Amendment: </T3>The purpose of this amendment is to provideenhanced punishment for the victimization of minors and children and toconform the structure of the guideline to that of andSection; 2A3.1 (CriminalSexual Abuse). <T3>Additional Explanatory Statement: </T3>The offense levels set forthin the amended Abusive Sexual Contact guideline (andSection; 2A3.4) are derivedfrom the original abusive sexual contact guideline and from analogous guidelinessuch as Criminal Sexual Abuse (andSection; 2A3.1), Criminal Sexual Abuseof a Minor (andSection; 2A3.2), and the Exploitation of a Minor guidelinesin Part G (andSection;andSection; 2G1.2, 2G2.1, 2G2.2). As stated in the accompanying commentary, the base offense level of sixin the original abusive sexual contact guideline ``applied to conduct thatis consensual.'' This refers to sexual conduct with a minor accomplishedwithout resort to the means set forth in 18 U.S.C. 2241(a), 2241(b) and2242. A nine level enhancement is provided for sexual contact committedby the means set forth in andSection; 2241 (a) or (b) (generally force) anda four level enhancement is provided for sexual contact committed by themeans set forth in andSection; 2242 (generally fear). No enhancements areprovided based upon the age of the victim.The amended guideline retains the ascending order of offense levels basedupon the means used to commit the crime, but adds enhancements based uponthe age of the victim. There is a two level enhancement if the victim isa minor (12 to 15 years old) and a four level enhancement if the victimis a child (11 years old or younger). These enhancements parallel the enhancementsfor minor and children victims in andSection; 2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse)and andSection; 2G1.2 (Transportation of a Minor for the Purpose of Prostitution).In addition, andSection; 2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Productionof Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material) and andSection; 2G2.2 (Transporting,Receiving, or Trafficking in Material Involving the Sexual Exploitationof a Minor) provide a two level enhancement for child victims. In thosetwo guidelines, the base offense level already encompasses victimizationof a minor. After incorporating ascending offense levels based upon the means usedto commit the crime and enhancements based upon the age of the victim,the offense levels set forth in the amended Abusive Sexual Contact guidelinehave been adjusted to insure that the same offense level (14) will resultin each of the following cases: Sexual contact with an adult committedby force, sexual contact with a child committed by fear and sexual contactwith a child committed without force or fear. In the parallel sexual abuseguideline (andSection; 2A3.1), the Commission has already determined thatthese three cases are of equal severity and therefore has assigned thesame offense level (31) to each. Recent legislation increased the maximum penalty for a violation of 18U.S.C. 2244 (a)(1) and (a)(3). [cite]. The Commission solicits public commenton whether the offense levels in andSection; 2A3.4 should be increased becausethe authorized maximum sentences for certain conduct covered by this guidelinehave been raised. andSection; 2A4.1 Kidnapping, Abduction, Unlawful Restraint <T3>29.

Both tables increase the offense level when theloss exceeds $2,000, but the Tax Loss Table provides a maximum 12 leveldifference while the Fraud Loss Table has a maximum 11 level difference.Up to $40,000 the tables are identical. Above $40,000 there are minor differences(e.g., from $40,001-$50,000 the Tax Loss Table provides a 1 level higheroffense level; from $50,001-$80,000 the offense levels are identical; from$80,001-$100,000 the Tax Loss Table again provides a 1 level higher offenselevel; from $100,001-$150,000 the offense levels are again identical; from$150,001-$200,000 Tax Loss Table again provides a 1 level higher offenselevel).

Related amendment: 16 (andSection; 2A2.1). 50. <T3>The Offense Level for Robbery: </T3>The Commission has received commentsfrom several sources, primarily Assistant United States Attorneys and certainDistrict Judges, to the effect that the guideline for robbery, andSection;2B3.1, results in sentences that are too low, especially for first offenders.\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Although andSection; 2B3.1 relates to robbery in general,the comments received so far have been confined to bank robbery. The vastmajority of all federal robbery prosecutions are for bank robbery.  The guideline was drafted in the expectation that it would result in sentencesthat, on average, would approximate past sentencing practices for bankrobbery,\2\<NOTE/> in terms of average time served.\3\<NOTE/> It was recognized, however, that for certain offenders withvery serious criminal records, the guideline sentences would greatly exceedthose served under past practice, because of the manner in which the Commissionimplemented the directive contained in 28 U.S.C. 994(h). See andSection;4B1.1 (Career Offender). Revision of andSection; 4B1.1, discussed below (Amendment243) is a related issue as to which the Commission expressly solicits comment.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Past practice showed that the average sentence for non-bankrobbery was substantially less than that for bank robbery (up to 5 offenselevels less, but the number of cases was quite small). The guidelines reducedthat difference to 0 or 1 level by raising the offense level for non-bankrobbery cases. Comment is solicited on whether there is a sufficient distinctionbetween bank robberies and other robberies to warrant a greater differencein offense level. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ As a result of the Sentencing Reform Act, parole was abolishedand ``good time'' credits were reduced to 54 days per year (15%). Thus,to produce the same time served, a sentence under the guidelines necessarilywould be much shorter than the sentence pronounced under the old law. Data collected by the Commission suggest that, under the guidelines, theaverage sentences for bank robbery may in fact be lower than in past practice,at least for certain classes of offenders. However, because the guidelineshave been in effect only since November 1, 1987 (for crimes committed onor after that date), and because a number of judges did not begin applyingthem until after the Supreme Court's decision in Mistretta, the Commission'sdata on practice under the guidelines are very preliminary, and do notyet provide a reliable basis for evaluating the workings of the currentguideline. The Commission is continuing to collect and analyze pertinentdata. The Commission will make reports summarizing and analyzing the dataavailable at the Commission's offices to those who are interested. Regardless of whether the current guideline accurately reflects past practice,it may be appropriate to raise (or lower) the guideline for other reasons.For example, sentences under the current guideline may not adequately reflectthe seriousness of the offense. Or it might be appropriate to incarceratethe offender for a longer period of time in order to protect the publicfrom offenses that he might otherwise commit. The typical bank robbery encountered in the federal system, whether armedor unarmed, involves the theft of less than $10,000, and no injuries orunlawful restraint. For such offenses, the guideline sentences (in months)are as follows: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>8,L2,i1,s100,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 </C><T4>Criminal History Category </T4><H1> </H1><H1>I </H1><H1>II </H1><H1>III </H1><H1>IV </H1><H1>V </H1><H1>VI </H1><H1>Career offender</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Unarmed <D>30-37 </D><D>33-41 </D><D>37-46 </D><D>46-57 </D><D>57-71 </D><D>63-78 </D><D>210-262 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Armed <D>41-51 </D><D>46-57 </D><D>51-63 </D><D>63-78 </D><D>77-96 </D><D>84-105 </D><D>262-327</D></ITAG></ITAG> Actual time served usually will be approximately 15% lower because of ``goodtime'' credits. Aggravating factors, such as discharge of a weapon, injuryto or restraint of a victim, or the theft of a larger sum of money, resultin longer sentences, except for career offenders. These sentences may bereduced by a guilty plea, in which event, except for career offenders,there usually is a decrease of 2 levels (approximately 20%). On the otherhand, these sentences could be increased by 2 levels (approximately 25%)if andSection; 3C1.1 (Obstruction of Justice) applies, or by 2 or more levelsif the defendant is also convicted of other offenses (see Chapter 3, PartD). Lower or higher sentences also may result though departure from theguidelines.As one possible response to the comments that the sentences under the currentguideline are too low, it has been proposed that the base offense levelin andSection; 2B3.1 be increased by six levels (from level 18 to level 24).This would result in the following guideline sentences for the typicalbank robbery:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>8,L2,tp0,i1,s10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10</C> <H1> </H1><T4>Criminal History Category</T4><H1> I</H1><H1> II</H1><H1> III</H1><H1> IV</H1><H1> V</H1><H1> VI</H1><H1> Career offender</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Unarmed<D> 57-71</D><D> 63-78</D><D> 70-87</D><D> 84-105</D><D> 100-125</D><D> 110-137</D><D> 210-262</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Armed<D> 78-97</D><D> 87-108</D><D> 97-121</D><D> 110-137</D><D> 130-162</D><D> 140-175</D><D> 262-327</D></ITAG></ITAG>The Commission solicits comment on whether the sentences produced by therobbery guideline are appropriate, and if not, in what respects the guidelineshould be changed.\4\<NOTE/> Comments need not be limited to the approach described above.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ A change in the sentences could be effected through changesin other guidelines, such as criminal livelihood or career offender. Commentmay be addressed to these or other issues.Concern also has been expressed that the guideline sentence may be undulylimited by the number of counts of conviction. (See Chapter 3, Part D,for guidelines dealing with multiple counts of conviction.) Under the guidelines,the offense level is not increased by offenses that are uncharged or countsthat are dismissed; the sentencing judge may consider them only withinthe guideline range or as a basis for departure. Under past practice, thesentencing judge was unconstrained in his consideration of other offenses.The parole guidelines took them into account regardless of whether therewas a conviction.This facet of the guidelines may result in lower sentences than under pastpractice if the prosecutor accepts a plea to one count of robbery whenthe defendant in fact has committed several robberies. It has been proposedthat the Commission amend the robbery guideline to explicitly take intoaccount other robberies of which the defendant has been not convicted.The following two amendments have been proposed as ways to accomplish this.[Option 1: Insert as an additional specific offense characteristic at andSection;2B3.1(b):``(6) If, as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or planas the offense of conviction, the defendant committed one or more additionalrobberies, increase by 2 levels. Do not, however, apply this adjustmentif the application defendant is convicted of multiple counts of robbery.''.][Option 2: Insert as an additional specific offense characteristic at andSection;2B3.1(b):``(6) If, as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or planas the offense of conviction, the defendant committed (A) one additionalrobbery, increase by 2 levels; (B) two additional robberies, increase by3 levels; (C) three or four additional robberies, increase by 4 levels;or (D) five or more additional robberies, increase by 5 levels.''.The following additional Application Note would be inserted as Note 9:<ITAG tagnum="21">``9. Multiple robberies are not grouped under andSection; 3D1.2(d).Where specific offense characteristic (b)(6) applies, multiple counts willbe grouped under andSection; 3D1.2(c).''.]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission solicits comment on whether either of these approachesshould be followed.</ITAG>51.<T3> Proposed Amendment:</T3> Section 2B3.1(b)(3) is amended by insertingat the end:``(D) If the degree of injury is between that specified in subdivisions(A) and (B), increase by 3 levels; or(E) If the degree of injury is between that specified in subdivisions (B)and (C), increase by 5 levels.''.The Commentary to andSection; 2B3.1 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amendedby deleting:<ITAG tagnum="21">``4.

Related Amendment: 57 (andSection;2B5.2). <T3>Additional Explanatory Statement: </T3>The proposed amendment revisesthe titles of andSection;andSection; 2B5.1 and 2B5.2 to make the coverage ofeach guideline clear from the title. Presently, the coverage of andSection;2B5.1 is specified in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to this guideline.For andSection; 2B5.1, the proposed amendment adopts the definition of ``counterfeit''used in 18 U.S.C. 513. ``Altered'' obligations (e.g., the corner of a noteof one denomination pasted on a note of a different denomination) are coveredunder andSection; 2B5.2.

Related amendment: 56 (andSection; 2B5.1).andSection; 2B6.1 Altering or Removing Motor Vehicle Identification Numbers,or Trafficking in Motor Vehicles or Parts with Altered or Obliterated IdentificationNumbers 58. <T3>Proposed Amendment: </T3>Section 2B6.1(b) is amended by renumberingsubsection (b)(2) as (b)(3) and inserting the following as subsection (b)(2):``(2) If the defendant was in the business of receiving and selling stolenproperty, increase by 2 levels.''. <T3>Reason for Amendment: </T3>The purpose of this amendment is to resolvean inconsistency between this section and andSection; 2B1.2 created by thelack of an enhancement in this section for a person in the business ofselling stolen property. Currently, a defendant convicted under the statutescovered by this section, which are expressly designed to cover traffickingin motor vehicles or parts with altered or obliterated identification numbers,could receive a lower offense level than if convicted of transportationor receipt of stolen property. This amendment eliminates this inconsistencyby adding a 2 level increase if the defendant was in the business of sellingstolen property. Two levels rather than four levels is the applicable increaseto conform to andSection; 2B1.2 because the base offense level of andSection;2B6.1 already incorporates the adjustment for more than minimal planning.59. <T3>Proposed Amendment: </T3>Section 2B6.1(b)(2) is amended by deleting``organized criminal activity'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``an organizedscheme to steal vehicles or vehicle parts, or to receive stolen vehiclesor vehicle parts''.

This section expressly covers extortion and attempted extortion;conspiracy is covered through the operation of andSection; 2X1.1. The presentphraseology could be misread as overriding the application of andSection;2X1.1 in conspiracy cases. 66. <T3>Issues concerning andSection; 2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, orReceiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of Official Right) and andSection;2C1.2 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Gratuity): </T3>Forthe purposes of this analysis, examples from andSection; 2C1.1 (Bribery)are used. However, the analysis is equally applicable to andSection; 2C1.2(Gratuity). Under the current bribery guideline, there is no enhancement for repeatedinstances of bribery if the conduct involves the same course of conductor common scheme or plan and the same victim (as frequently is the casewhere the government is the victim) because such cases are grouped underandSection; 3D1.2(b). In contrast, the fraud and theft guidelines providea 2-level increase in cases of repeated instances under the second prongof the ``more than minimal planning'' definition.Unlike the theft and fraud guidelines, it is arguable that the value ofany bribe that was part of the same course of conduct or a common schemeor plan as the offense of conviction, but not included in the count ofconviction, is excluded from consideration. This is because andSection; 1B1.3(a)(2),which authorizes consideration of conduct not expressly included in theoffense of conviction but part of the same course of conduct or commonscheme or plan, applies only to offenses grouped under andSection; 3D1.2(d).Thus, if the defendant pleads to one count of a bribery offense involvingone $10,000 bribe in satisfaction of a 15 count indictment involving anadditional $80,000 in separate bribes that were part of the same courseof conduct, the current bribery guideline, unlike the theft and fraud guidelines,would not take into account the additional $80,000, and there would beno increase for repeated instances. The current guideline may also create various anomalies because the multiplecount rule (which applies only where the offenses are not grouped underandSection; 3D1.2(b)) increases the offense level much faster than the monetarytable. For example, an elected public official who takes three unrelated$200 bribes has an offense level of 21; the same defendant who took twounrelated $500,000 bribes would have an offense level of 20. The Commission seeks comment and suggestions on whether and how the guidelinesshould be amended to address these issues. One possible way to addressthese issues is presented below, but the Commission seeks recommendationsas to any other appropriate solutions. In the example shown below, an enhancementof 2 levels is added for repeated instances (similar to the second prongof ``more than minimal planning'' in the theft and fraud guidelines) andandSection; 2D1.2(d) is amended to include bribery offenses. An illustration of one possible way of addressing these issues follows:Section 2C1.1(b) is amended by deleting ``(1)'' and ``(2)'' and insertingin lieu thereof ``(A)'' and ``(B)'' respectively; and by deleting ``Applythe greater'' and inserting in lieu thereof: ``(1) If the offense involved more than one bribe, increase by 2 levels.(2) If more than one of the following applies, use the greater:''.

Questionshave repeatedly been raised as to what is proper offense level for a quantityfalling between the stated levels (e.g., 99.4 kg of Marihuana). Becausethe ``base offense levels in andSection; 2D1.1 are either provided directlyby the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 or are proportional to the levels establishedby statute'' (Guidelines Manual p. 2.46), the correct interpretation isthat at least 100 kg is required for Level 26.The Commission seeks comment on eliminating these gaps by revising thesecond through the fifteenth paragraph of the Table to read ``At least_butless than_'' for each controlled substance (e.g., Level 24 would include``At least 80 kg but less than l00 kg of Marihuana''; Level 26 would include``At least 100 kg but less than 400 kg of Marihuana''). 81. <T3>Proposed Amendment: </T3>Section 2D1.1 is amended in the table captioned``Drug Quantity Table'' by deleting ``**'' immediately following ``Level32'' and immediately following ``Level 26'', and by deleting ``** Statutespecifies a mandatory minimum sentence.''.

LSD may be sold on various carriers such as a sugar cube or on blotterpaper. A sugar cube weighs approximately 2,270 mg., a piece of blotterpaper the size used to hold one dose weighs about 14 mg., and a dose ofLSD weighs about .05 mg. Therefore, if the carrier was weighed as partof the mixture, a person selling 100 doses of LSD would have an offenselevel of 32, or 26, or 12 depending on whether the LSD was on a sugar cube,blotter paper, or in a liquid form. The Commission seeks comment on the most appropriate response to this situation(i.e., should or should not the Commission amend the guidelines or Commentaryto exclude the weight of the ``carrier'' in LSD cases for guideline purposes?).83. <T3>Relationship of Marihuana Plants to Marihuana: </T3>Section 6479 ofthe Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 alters the manner in which theoffense level for marihuana plants is calculated under 21 U.S.C. 841. Under21 U.S.C. 841, as amended, an offense involving 100 marihuana plants istreated as equivalent to an offense involving 100 kilograms of marihuana,and an offense involving 1,000 marihuana plants is treated as equivalentto an offense involving 1,000 kilograms of marihuana. From the legislativehistory, it appears that this change was directed primarily towards largescale marihuana growers. The statutory authorized maximum for an offenseinvolving fewer than 50 plants (five years) remains unchanged. This statutory revision requires revision of the relationship of marihuanaplants to marihuana in the guidelines for offense levels 26 and above (currently100 marihuana plants is treated as the equivalent of 10 kilograms of marihuana;1000 marihuana plants is treated as the equivalent of 100 kilograms ofmarihuana). A more difficult question is how to treat this relationship when thereare fewer than 100 marihuana plants. Information from the Drug EnforcementAdministration indicates that the yield from a marihuana plant varies butthe average yield is about 0.4 kilogram. A plant could be expected to yield1 kilogram only with sophisticated growing methods. The Commission seeks comment on how this statutory revision should be addressed.Specifically, should or should not the Commission use a lower ratio ofmarihuana plants to marihuana if there are fewer than 100 plants; and,if so, at which point or points should a lower ratio be used? 84. <T3>Proposed Amendment: </T3>The Commentary to andSection; 2D1.1 captioned``Application Notes'' is amended in Note 10 in the section of the ``DrugEquivalency Tables'' captioned ``Schedule I or II Opiates'' on the linebeginning ``piperidinyl] Propanamide) ='' by deleting ``31.25 gm'' andinserting in lieu thereof ``2.5 gm''. <T3>Reason for Amendment: </T3>The purpose of this amendment is to conformthe equivalency for fentanyl to that set forth in the Drug Quantity Tableand statute.85.<T3> Proposed Amendment:</T3> The Commentary to andSection;

The Commission seeks comment on the most appropriate method of respondingto these statutory provisions. One possible approach follows, but suggestionsfor alternative approaches are also invited. For example, andSection;andSection;2D1.2 and 2D1.3 could be amended by deleting the guidelines and accompanyingCommentary in their entirety and inserting in lieu thereof:<ITAG tagnum="73">``andSection; 2DI.2 Drug Offenses Occurring Near Protected Locationsor Involving Underage or Pregnant Individuals </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Base offense level: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) 2 plus the offense level from andSection; 2D1.1, but in no eventless than level 26, if the offense involved a person less than I8 yearsof age; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) 1 plus the offense level from andSection; 2D1.1, but in no eventless than level 13, in any other case.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74"> Commentary </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Statutory Provisions: </T3>18 U.S.C. 845, 845a, 845b. </ITAG><T3>Background: </T3>This section implements the direction to the Commissionin section 6454 of the Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.''.This approach would implement the directive in section 6454, expand thecoverage of the guideline to include the provision of sections 6458 and6459, and provide an intermediate enhancement for the portions of 21 U.S.C.845, 845a, and 845b not included in the statutory direction to the Commission.andSection; 2D1.4 Attempts and Conspiracies 93. <T3>Proposed Amendment: </T3>The Commentary to andSection; 2D1.4 captioned``Application Notes'' is amended in Note 1 by deleting:<ITAG tagnum="21">``Where the defendant was not reasonably capable of producing thenegotiated amount, the court may depart and impose a sentence lower thanthe sentence that would otherwise result'',</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">and inserting in lieu thereof:<ITAG tagnum="21">``However, where the court finds that the defendant did not intendto produce and was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount,the court shall exclude from the guideline calculation the amount thatit finds the defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonablycapable of producing.''.</ITAG><T3>Reason for Amendment: </T3>Application Note 1 currently provides thatthe ``weight under negotiation in an uncompleted distribution shall beused to calculate the applicable amount.'' The instruction then provides``Where the defendant was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiatedamount the court may depart and impose a sentence lower than the sentencethat would otherwise result.'' This provision may result in inflated offenselevels in uncompleted offenses where a defendant is merely ``puffing,''even though the court is then authorized to address the situation by adownward departure. This amendment provides a more direct procedure forcalculating the offense level where the court finds that the defendantdid not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing thenegotiated amount. 94. <T3>Proposed Amendment: </T3>The Commentary to andSection; 2D1.4 captioned``Application Notes'' is amended in Note 1 by deleting ``the sentence shouldbe imposed only on the basis of the defendant's conduct or the conductof co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy that was known to thedefendant or was reasonably foreseeable'' and inserting in lieu thereof``see Application Note 1 to andSection; 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).''.<T3>Reason for Amendment: </T3>The purpose of this amendment is to conformthis Commentary to the revision of andSection; 1B1.3 (amendment 12). 95. <T3>Proposed Amendment: </T3>Section 2D1.4(a) is amended by deleting ``participatingin an incomplete'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``a''. <T3>Reason for Amendment: </T3>The purpose of this amendment is to clarifythe guideline. andSection; 2D1.5 Continuing Criminal Enterprise 96. <T3>Proposed Amendment: </T3>Section 2D1.5 is amended by deleting: ``(a)Base Offense Level: 36'' and inserting in lieu thereof the following: ``(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greater): (1) 4 plus the offense level from andSection; 2D1.1 applicable to the underlyingoffense; or (2) [37][38].''. The Commentary to andSection; 2D1.5 captioned ``Background'' is amended inthe first paragraph by deleting ``base offense level of 36'' and insertingin lieu thereof ``minimum base offense level of [37][38]'', and in thesecond paragraph by deleting ``for second convictions'' and inserting inlieu thereof ``for the first conviction, a 30 year mandatory minimum penaltyfor a second conviction,''. <T3>Reason for Amendment: </T3>The purpose of this amendment is to reflectthe increased mandatory minimum penalty for this offense pursuant to section6481 of the Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Pub.

The Commission seeks public comment onthe general question of how the guidelines should incorporate mandatoryminimum penalties. Specifically, if the Commission chooses to reflect theminimum penalty in the base offense level, what principles should governthe selection of the offense level? In this instance, the mandatory minimumpenalty (240 months) is approximately the midpoint of the sentencing rangefor a defendant in Criminal History Category I if level 37 is chosen, butit is close to the low end of the range if level 38 is chosen. Which ofthese approaches, or what other approach, is most appropriate? andSection; 2D1.6 (Use of a Communications Facility in Committing Drug Offense)97. <T3>Proposed Amendment: </T3>Section 2D1.6 is amended by deleting ``:12''and inserting in lieu thereof: ``(Apply the greater): (1) [3 levels less than the][The] offense level from andSection; 2D1.1 applicableto the controlled substance offense committed, caused, or facilitated;or (2) 12.''. The Commentary to andSection; 2D1.6 is amended by inserting immediately before``Background'' the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">``<T3>Application Note: </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. It is expected that, in the vast majority of cases, the offenselevel for the underlying offense (the controlled substance offense committed,caused, or facilitated) will be level 12 or greater. An alternative baseoffense level of 12 is provided under subsection (a)(2) because it maynot always be possible to determine the offense level for the underlyingoffense. In the rare case in which it can be determined that the offenselevel for the underlying offense is less than level 12, a downward departuremay be warranted.''.</ITAG><T3>Reason for Amendment: </T3>The purpose of this amendment is to reduceunwarranted disparity by requiring consideration of the amount of the controlledsubstance involved in the offense, thus conforming this guideline to analogousguidelines. <T3>Additional Explanatory Statement: </T3>The statute to which this guidelineapplies (21 U.S.C. 843(b)) prohibits the use of a communications facilityto commit, cause, or facilitate a felony drug offense. Frequently, a convictionunder this statute is the result of a plea bargain because the statutehas a low maximum (four years with no prior felony drug conviction; eightyears with a prior felony drug conviction) and no mandatory minimum. The current guideline has base offense level of 12 and no specific offensecharacteristics. Therefore, the scale of the underlying drug offense doesnot affect the guideline. This results in a departure being warranted inthe vast majority of cases if the scale of the underlying drug offenseis a permissible grounds for departure. A recent Second Circuit decision(U.S. v. Correa-Vargas, CA 2, No. 88-1167, 10/18/88), for example, uphelda lower court decision for a substantial departure based upon the quantityof the controlled substance involved in the underlying offense. Without guidance as to whether how far to depart, the potential for unwarranteddisparity is substantial. Under the proposed amendment, the guideline wouldtake into account the scale of the underlying offense. The Commission seeks comment on whether the base offense level in subsection(a)(1) should be set at the offense level from andSection; 2D1.1 for theunderlying offense; or whether it should be set at 3-levels less than thatfor the underlying offense, which would be comparable to the treatmentof certain uncompleted conspiracies and attempts under andSection; 2X1.1 andSection; 2D1.10 Endangering Human Life While Illegally Manufacturing aControlled Substance 98. <T3>Proposed Amendment: </T3>Chapter Two, Part D is amended by insertingas an additional guideline the following: ``andSection; 2D1.10 Endangering Human Life While Illegally Manufacturinga Controlled Substance (a) Base Offense Level: 3 plus the offense level from the Drug QuantityTable in andSection; 2D1.1, but in no event less than 20. <ITAG tagnum="74">Commentary </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Statutory Provision: </T3>21 U.S.C. <T2>XXX</T2>.''.</ITAG><T3>Reason for Amendment: </T3>The purpose of this amendment is to createa new guideline covering the new offense in section 6301 of the OmnibusAnti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. <T3>Additional Explanatory Statement: </T3>Under the proposed guideline,the offense level would vary with the type and quantity of drug manufacturedplus a 3 level enhancement for the risk created, with a minimum offenselevel of 20.<ITAG tagnum="84"> Chapter Two Part D, Subpart I</ITAG>99. <T3>Chapter Two Part D, Subpart I:</T3> Sections 6053, 6055, and 6057 ofthe Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988: Sections 6053, 6055, and 6057of the Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 concern the chemicals and equipmentused to manufacture controlled substances. Section 6053 creates recordkeepingrequirements for ``listed precursor chemicals'' and ``listed essentialchemicals.'' Section 6055 makes it unlawful to (1) possess a listed chemicalwith intent to manufacture a controlled substance, (2) possess or distributea listed chemical knowing or having reasonable cause to believe it willbe used to manufacture a controlled substance, and (3) import or exportsuch chemicals. Section 6057 makes it unlawful to possess, manufacture,distribute, or import certain laboratory equipment and supplies with intentto manufacture a controlled substance.

Related amendment: 113 (andSection; 2E5.4).Additional Explanatory Statement: The offense guideline at andSection; 2E5.2covers theft and embezzlement from employee pension and welfare benefitplans. Basically, the guideline copies the theft guideline. However, itcontains its own enhancement for an abuse of trust (andSection; 2E5.2(b)(2))that is written more narrowly than the general abuse of trust provisionin andSection; 3B1.3. Commentary indicates that when this specific offensecharacteristic applies, andSection; 3B1.3 is not to be applied. However,applying andSection; 2E5.2(b)(2) for one type of abuse of trust (and thennot applying andSection; 3B1.3) and applying andSection; 3B1.3 for all otherabuse of trust appears an unnecessary complication when andSection; 3B1.3already includes the abuse of trust covered in andSection; 2E5.2(b)(2).

Both tables increase the offense level when theloss exceeds $2,000, but the Tax Loss Table provides a maximum 12 leveldifference while the Fraud Loss Table has a maximum 11 level difference.Up to $40,000 the tables are identical. Above $40,000 there are minor differences(e.g., from $40,001-$50,000 the Tax Loss Table provides a 1 level higheroffense level; from $50,001-$80,000 the offense levels are identical; from$80,001 $100,000 the Tax Loss Table again provides a 1 level higher offenselevel; from $100,001-$150,000 the offense levels are again identical; from$150,001-$200,000 Tax Loss Table again provides a 1 level higher offenselevel). Because the tax loss table contains one additional level, thisamendment will increase the offense level by one level in some cases. Relatedamendment: 32 (andSection; 2B1.1).

The Commentary to andSection; 2F1.1 captioned ``Background'' is amendedin the fourth sentence of the third paragraph by deleting ``not only'',and by deleting ``, but also specifies that the minimum offense level insuch cases shall be 10.''<T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purpose of this amendment is to limitthe applicability of the minimum offense level of 10 in specific offensecharacteristic (b)(2) to cases under subdivision (c) or (d).<T3> Additional Explanatory Statement:</T3> Under andSection; 2F1.1 thereis a two level adjustment for more than minimal planning (andSection; 2F1.1(b)(2)(A))or a scheme to defraud more than one victim (andSection; 2F1.1(b)(2)(B)),but if the resulting offense level is less than 10, the offense level isincreased to 10. The comparable adjustment from andSection; 2B1.1 is also2 levels but no minimum level of 10 is specified. Because there is substantialoverlap in the conduct covered by the forgery/fraud guideline (andSection;2F1.1) on the one hand and the theft/embezzlement guideline (andSection;2B1.1) on the other (e.g., mail theft generally involves the theft of checkswhich are then forged), this difference may result in significant anomaliesdue to charging decisions unrelated to the conduct or culpability of theoffender. Furthermore, this offense level produces a result that is anomalouswith the counterfeiting guidelines (andSection;andSection; 2B5.1 and 5.2) inthat passing less than $2,000 in counterfeit bills over a period of timeresults in an offense level of 9 under andSection; 2B5.1, but passing severalforged checks of less than $2,000 over the same period of time producesan offense level of 10 under andSection; 2B5.2 because of the reference toandSection; 2F1.1. The original reason for inserting the minimum level of10 in 2F1.1 was that FPSSIS data showed an increased level for cases withmore than minimal planning but no specified loss. This, however, has beenaddressed by the Commission's having adopted a definition of loss thatincludes intended loss (FPSSIS data included only actual loss). The proposedamendment conforms the ``more than minimal planning'' adjustment in fraud(andSection; 2F1.1) and theft (andSection; 2B1.1). 118.<T3> Proposed Amendment:</T3> The Commentary to andSection; 2F1.1 captioned``Application Notes'' is amended beginning in Note 14 by deleting:<ITAG tagnum="21"> ``In such instances, although andSection; 2F1.1 applies, a departuremay be warranted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"> 15.

Section 2(b) of the Major Fraud Act of 1988(pertaining to certain large scale procurement frauds against the government)requires that the Commission promulgate a new guideline or amend an existingguideline to provide an enhanced penalty ``where conscious or recklessrisk of serious personal injury resulting from the fraud has occurred''and that the Commission consider the appropriateness of assigning a 2-levelenhancement in such cases. The Commission seeks comment on the most appropriateway of responding to this instruction. For example, should the Commissionprovide an enhancement only for the cases covered by the Major Fraud Actor should the Commission provide such an enhancement for all types of fraud?Should a specific offense characteristic also provide a minimum offenselevel (i.e., an offense level of not less than) to address cases in whicha risk of serious injury was created but there was no monetary loss orlittle monetary loss. Both the Major Fraud Act of 1988 and the Insider Trading and SecuritiesFraud Enforcement Act of 1988 provide a maximum penalty of ten years' imprisonment.The Commission seeks comment on whether these should be a higher offenselevel for insider trading or procurement fraud than for other frauds. Similarly,should there be a higher offense level for fraud involving a federallychartered or insured financial institution? Or, should additional levelsfor monetary loss be added instead to the loss table for such offensesto take into account the greater losses that are associated with such offenses?If so, what additional distinctions are appropriate? Presently, lossessubstantially in excess of $5 million are addressed as a departure considerationin Application Note 10 of the Commentary to andSection; 2F1.1. Another wayto respond, for example, would be to add additional levels to the losstable in andSection; 2F1.1 (as amended by proposed amendments 115 and 116).For example, under the mathematical progression used in the guidelines,the guidelines could be amended to add 15 levels for frauds of more than$10 million, and 16 levels for frauds of more than $20 million. A related issue is whether the loss table in andSection; 2F1.1 (as amendedby proposed amendments 115 and 116) provides the appropriate adjustmentfor monetary loss or whether it should be revised in some other way (upwardor downward).The Commission also seeks comment on whether the specific offense characteristicat andSection; 2F1.1(b)(3) (pertaining to the use of foreign bank accountsor transactions to conceal the nature or extent of the offense) shouldalso be applied to andSection; 2F1.2 (Insider Trading), and on whether additionalmodifications to the guidelines are appropriate to respond to the abovenoted legislation. andSection; 2G1.1 Transportation for the Purpose of Prostitution or ProhibitedSexual Conduct. 120. <T3>Proposed Amendment: </T3>Section 2G1.1(b)(1) is amended by deleting``defendant used'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``offense involved theuse of'', and by deleting ``drugs or otherwise'' and inserting in lieuthereof ``threats or drugs or in any manner''.

Currently, specific offense characteristic (b)(1) applies only tobase offense level (a)(1).

Under 18 U.S.C. 3147, a sentence of imprisonment must be imposedin addition to the sentence for the underlying offense, and the sentenceof imprisonment imposed under 18 U.S.C. 3147 must run consecutively toany other sentence of imprisonment. In order to avoid `double counting',the court will have to ensure that the `total punishment' (i.e., the sentencefor the offense committed while on release plus the sentence enhancementunder 18 U.S.C. 3147) is in accord with the guideline range for the offensecommitted while on release, as adjusted by the enhancement in this section.e.g., if the applicable guideline range is 30-37 months and the court determines`total punishment' of 36 months is appropriate, a sentence of 30 monthsfor the underlying offense plus 6 months under 18 U.S.C. 3147 would satisfythis requirement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Background: </T3>An enhancement under 18 U.S.C. 3147 may be imposedonly upon application of the government; it cannot be imposed on the court'sown motion.

(Senate Report98-225 at 186). Not all of the phraseology relating to the requirementof a mandatory sentence, however, was actually deleted from the statute.Consequently, it appears the court is required to impose a consecutivesentence of imprisonment under this provision, but there is no requirementas to any minimum term. This guideline is drafted to enable the court todetermine and implement a combined `total punishment' consistent with theoverall structure of the guidelines, while at the same time complying withthe statutory requirement. Guideline provisions that prohibit the groupingof counts of conviction requiring consecutive sentences (e.g., the introductoryparagraph of andSection; 3D1.2; andSection; 5G1.2(a)) do not apply to thissection because 18 U.S.C. 3147 is an enhancement, not a count of conviction.''.</ITAG><T3> Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purpose of this amendment is to reflectthe fact that 18 U.S.C. 3147 is an enhancement provision, not a distinctoffense.<T3> Additional Explanatory Statement:</T3> During the development of theoriginal set of guidelines, there was some confusion as to whether 18 U.S.C.3147 was a criminal offense or an enhancement provision. It turns out itis an enhancement provision. To complicate matters, the statute and legislativehistory do not match exactly. Created in 1984 as part of the ComprehensiveCrime Control Act, the statute contained interim provisions (mandatoryconsecutive sentences that were subject to the parole and good time provisionsof prior law) that were to be in effect until the sentencing guidelinestook effect. The Senate Report to S.1762 indicates that the mandatory natureof the interim provisions was to be eliminated when the sentencing guidelinestook effect (``Section 213(h) [section 220(g) of the CCCA of 1984] amendsthe new provision in title I of this Act relating to consecutive enhancedpenalties for committing an offense while on release (new 18 U.S.C. 3147))by eliminating the mandatory nature of the penalties in favor of utilizingsentencing guidelines'' (Senate Report 98-225 at 186). The statute, asamended, however, did not actually eliminate all language referring tomandatory penalties. A mandatory consecutive term of imprisonment is requiredbut, unlike other mandatory provisions, there is no minimum required. Consequently,no real restriction is placed on the court; i.e., a consecutive sentenceof 1 day's imprisonment is not prohibited. The Commission attempted to deal with the mandatory consecutive requirementof this provision by treating it as if it constituted a separate offense,but this treatment has caused several problems. Treating this provision as if it were a separate offense engenders a varietyof questions, including whether and how victim adjustments, obstruction,and acceptance of responsibility apply to this provision, whether a termof supervised release can be imposed if no term of imprisonment is imposedon the underlying offense, whether a fine can be imposed; and how the costof supervision on the consecutive part of the term is to be considered.Moreover, while other enhancements vary with the offense level for theunderlying offense, this enhancement varies with the much cruder measureof the statutory maximum penalty for the underlying offense (e.g., underthe current guideline, possessing a counterfeit ten dollar bill would resultin a greater enhancement than interstate or foreign travel or transportationin aid of racketeering activity). The amendment recommended below converts this section into an offenselevel adjustment for the offense committed while on release, a treatmentthat is considerably more consistent with the treatment of other offense/offendercharacteristics.The Commission seeks public comment as to whether 2, 3, or 4 level enhancementis appropriate. andSection; 2J1.8 Bribery of a Witness 143. <T3>Proposed Amendment: </T3>Section 2J1.8(b)(1) is amended by deleting``substantially interfered'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``resulted insubstantial interference''.

Currently, there is no guideline for 18U.S.C. 844(g). The Commission intends to promulgate a guideline to coverthis offense and seeks comment on the appropriate base offense level andspecific offense characteristics for this guideline.<ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter Two Part K, Subpart 2 </ITAG>154. <T3>Revision of Chapter Two, Part K, Subpart 2: </T3>The Commission seekscomment on a revision of Chapter Two, Part K, Subpart 2, to address a numberof diverse substantive and technical issues, as well as the creation ofseveral new offenses, and increased statutory maximum penalties for certainother offenses. Various issues concerning the current guidelines are discussedand an example of an approach to address these issues is shown in amendmentform. The Commission seeks comment on this apporach as well as any recommendationsfor alternative approaches to address these issues. A significant problem with the present guideline is that there are a largenumber of overlapping statutory provisions so that the three basic guidelines,andSection; 2K2.1 (Possession by a prohibited person), andSection; 2K2.2 (Possessionof certain types of weapons), and andSection; 2K2.3 (Unlawful trafficking),are not closely tied to the actual conduct. For example, possession ofa machine gun might be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. 922(o) or 26 U.S.C. 5861(a).Prosecution under the first listed statute results in an offense levelof 6; prosecution under the second results in an offense level of 12. Inother cases, offenses involving trafficking in multiple firearms are referencedby the offense of conviction to andSection; 2K2.1 or andSection; 2K2.2 wherethere is no table to take into account multiple firearms. The amendmentshown below addresses this issue by consolidating the current three guidelinesinto two guidelines: (1) Unlawful possession, receipt, or transportation,and (2) unlawful trafficking; and by more carefully drawing the distinctionsbetween the base offense levels provided. The third guideline shown inthis amendment is a new guideline to address transfer of a weapon withintent or knowledge that it will be used to commit another offense (formerlycovered in a cross reference) and a new offense added by the Omnibus Anti-DrugAbuse Act of 1988 (section 6211) (lnterstate travel to acquire a firearmfor a criminal purpose). In addition, it is not clear that ``used'' in the cross-reference in andSection;2K2.1 will be consistently read as including ``possessed in connectionwith''. The amendment shown below addresses this issue. Other cross-referencesare provided to ensure that if both the amended andSection;andSection; 2K2.1and 2K2.2 are applicable, the guideline having the greater offense levelwill apply. The current guideline uses the term ``Firearms or Other Weapons'' becausethe term ``firearm'' used in the underlying statutes is broader than theusual definition of firearm found in andSection; 1B1.1. However, the undefinedterm ``other weapons'' is confusing, and ammunition, which is covered bythe statute, is omitted from the guideline title. The amendment shown belowuses the term ``Firearms or Ammunition'' in andSection; 2K2.1 and providesan Application Note in both andSection; 2K2.1 and andSection; 2K2.2 to indicatethat the definition of firearm is different from that used in the generaldefinitions in andSection; 1B1.1.The base offense level for conduct covered by the current andSection; 2K2.1is increased in the amendment shown below from 9 to 12 (the same base offenselevel as the current andSection; 2K2.2). The statutorily authorized maximumsentence for the conduct covered under andSection; 2K2.1 was increased fromfive to ten years by the Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (section 6462).Note, however, that the most aggravated conduct under andSection; 2K2.1 (possessionof a weapon during commission of another offense) is handled by the cross-referenceat subsection (c) and is based upon the offense level for an attempt tocommit the underlying offense. See Background Commentary to current andSection;2K2.1. In addition, the amendment shown below raises the enhancement forstolen weapons or obliterated serial numbers from 1 to 2 levels to betterreflect the seriousness of this conduct. The numbers currently used inthe table for the distribution of multiple weapons in andSection; 2K2.2 areshown [Option 1] as well as an option that would increase the offense levelincreases somewhat more rapidly for sale of multiple weapons [Option 2].The example shown below retains the offense level of 12 for unlawful possessionof a machine gun, sawed off shotgun, or destructive device; and level 16for a firearm silencer or muffler. All of these weapons are prohibitedunder 18 U.S.C. 5861. Comment is sought as to whether the Commission shouldprovide the same offense level for all such weapons, and if so, a recommendationas to the appropriate offense level. Section 2K2.1 and accompanying Commentary, except for Commentary captioned``Background'', are deleted and the following inserted in lieu thereof:``andSection; 2K2.1 Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearmsor Ammunition (a) Base Offense Level (Apply the Greater).

Otherwise, the maximum penalty is two years'imprisonment. The Commission seeks public comment on whether and how andSection; 2L1.2should be amended to address the distinctions added by this statute. Oneway might be to add a specific offense characteristic to provide an increasein the case of an alien previously deported after conviction of a felonyother than an immigration law violation, and to allow an upward departurein the case of an ``aggravated felony'' due to the wide range of conductwithin the definition of an aggravated felony (e.g., from first degreemurder to sale of a small quantity of a controlled substance). This specificoffense characteristic would be in additon to, and not in lieu of, criminalhistory points added for the prior sentence. The issue of the appropriateenhancement for an aggravated felony would be deferred until the Commissioncan analyze current practice data through its case monitoring system. For example, andSection; 2L1.2 might be amended by inserting the followingadditional specific offense characteristic: ``(b) Specific Offense Characteristic (1) If the defendant previously was deported after sustaining a convictionfor a felony, other than a felony involving violation of the immigrationlaws, increase by [2][3][4] levels.'',</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"> and the Commentary to andSection; 2L1.2 captioned ``Application Notes''might be amended by adding the following additional Note:<ITAG tagnum="21"> ``3.

It also does not appear to applyto law enforcement or correctional employees who are not sworn officersunless they are Justice Department employees. The purpose of this amendmentis to correct this error. 169. <T3>Offense Levels for Certain Escapes: </T3>Under the current guidelines,an escape from custody resulting from a conviction or a lawful arrest fora felony has a base offense level of 13. If, however, the escape is fromnon-secure custody and the defendant returns voluntarily within 96 hours,the base offense level is reduced by 7 levels to level 6. If the defendantdoes not return voluntarily within 96 hours, there is no difference inoffense level between an escape from secure or non-secure custody. The Commission seeks comment on whether an additional distinction shouldbe made between escape from secure and non-secure custody for cases notcovered by the 7 level reduction for voluntary return from an escape fromnon-secure secure custody within 96 hours. Some practitioners have reportedthat the guidelines have drastically increased the sanctions for escapesfrom non-secure custody not eligible for the 7-level reduction as contrastedto past practice. Most such defendants will have a criminal history scoreof at least five (at least 2 points from andSection; 4A1.1(b); 2 points fromandSection; 4A1.1(d); and 1 point from andSection; 4A1.1(e)). The Bureau ofPrisons has recommended an offense level of 10 (3-levels less than baseoffense level 13) for an escape from non-secure custody not qualifyingfor the reduction for voluntary return within 96 hours). The Commission also seeks comment on whether there should be any reductionfor voluntary return and, if such a reduction is appropriate, whether the96 hours distinction currently used is appropriate. Comment is also soughton whether any distinction between escape from secure and non-secure custodyshould take into account the nature of the offense for which he is confined,or the security level of the institution in which the defendant is confined.If a distinction between escape from secure and non-secure custody is appropriate,should or should not this distinction apply in the case of all offendersor should such a distinction not apply to certain offenders such as drugtraffickers or violent offenders? Should a failure to return from a furloughfrom a secure institution be treated differently than a failure to returnfrom a furlough from a non-secure institution? Where a defendant is returnedto custody following an arrest for a new crime while on escape status,such return does not constitute a voluntary return for guideline purposes.Should the guidelines, however, provide an additional distinction to covercases in which the defendant returns voluntarily from an escape and islater discovered to have committed a new offense while on escape status?If additional distinctions to the guidelines are believed warranted, commentsare sought as to the most appropriate structure to accommodate such distinctions.andSection; 2P1.2 Providing or Possessing Contraband in Prison 170. <T3>Proposed Amendment: </T3>Section 2P1.2(b)(1) is amended by deleting:``If the defendant committed the offense while a correctional officer orother employee of the Department of Justice, increase by 2 levels.'',</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">and inserting in lieu thereof: ``If the defendant was a law enforcement or correctional officer or employee,or an employee of the Department of Justice, at the time of the offense,increase by 2 levels.''. <T3>Reason for Amendment: </T3>The current specific offense characteristic(b)(3) applies only to correctional officers or Justice Department employees,and not to local or state law enforcement officers who might have custodyof a federal prisoner, or even to federal law enforcement officers whoare not employed by the Department of Justice (e.g., Secret Service agentsare employed by the Treasury Department).

Because interest accumulates,the amount of tax evaded would have to be determined year by year, frequentlyat different interest rates. The interest also accrues until the date offiling of an indictment or information. Thus, another complicating factoris that charges are sometimes withdrawn and refiled; in such cases it isnot clear which cut-off date controls. Where multiple years of evasionare involved (which is normally the case), these calculations must be doneseparately for each year that taxes were evaded. This complexity is inconsistentwith the spirit of the Commentary in andSection; 2T1.1 which describes howthe overlapping guideline ranges are designed to minimize the significanceof disputes about tax loss. In addition, the inclusion of interest appearsinconsistent with all other property offense guidelines and even some taxoffense guidelines. When the individual is a victim in a theft or fraudcase, lost interest does not increase the penalty for the defendant. Adoptionof the proposed amendment should not result in significant changes in sentences;in most cases the deletion of interest will not affect the offense levelby more than one level, if at all.

Clarification of Definitions: The Commission has received feedbackfrom probation officers and others that certain definitions in this section(particularly the definition of ``Sentence of Imprisonment'' in ApplicationNote 2 and ``Related Offenses'' in Application Note 3) are difficult toapply in certain cases. The Commission seeks comment on how these definitions,or any other of the other definitions or instructions in this section canbe improved. andSection; 4B1.1 Career Offender 243. <T3>The Career Offender Guideline: </T3>In 28 U.S.C. 994(h), the Commissionwas directed to ``assure that the guidelines specify a sentence to a termof imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized for categories ofdefendants'' if the defendant is convicted of a felony that is a ``crimeof violence'' or a drug trafficking offense and has two such prior convictions.In the initial guidelines, the Commission interpreted this directive literally.Section 4B1.1 (Career Offender) currently specifies in essence that a defendantwho is a career offender (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 994(h)) be sentencedto a term of imprisonment of from about 12% below the statutory maximumto about 10% above the statutory maximum\5\<NOTE/> for the ``crime of violence'' or drug trafficking offenseof which he is convicted. For example, for an armed robbery conviction,the defendant would be sentenced to approximately 22 to 27 years in prison;for unarmed robbery, 17.5 to 22 years; and, for selling ten grams of heroin,approximately 22 to 27 years. If the defendant is convicted of more thanone count of a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense, the counthaving the highest maximum is used to determine the sentence.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The term of imprisonment could exceed the statutory maximumfor a single count in the event of convictions on multiple counts. This guideline has been criticized on a number of grounds, including: (1)Sentences based only on the statutory maximum ignore significant variationsin the seriousness of the actual offense conduct and therefore (a) areunjust and (b) provide no marginal deterrence; (2) the sentence is frequentlyexcessive in relation to the seriousness of the actual offense conduct;(3) the sentence is too heavily dependent on the charge of conviction forthe instant offense and prior offenses (e.g., a prior robbery offense resultingin a state robbery conviction pursuant to a plea agreement for a sentenceof probation counts as a prior conviction of a crime of violence, but aprior robbery offense resulting in negotiated plea to a grand larceny chargeand imposition of a ten year prison term does not count as a prior convictionof a crime of violence. Thus, differences in plea negotiation practicesamong state courts can affect whether the career offender provision appliesand result in a very large difference in the guideline range); (4) thedistinction between the criminal records of offenders with a criminal historyCategory VI and those who are career offenders is insufficient to warrantsuch large differences in the resulting sentence; (5) the sentences arelonger than are needed for incapacitation, and therefore waste prison space,which is in short supply and could be better used for other offenders;(6) prisons are not equipped to house the aged offenders who will be incarceratedas a result of this guideline; and (7) acceptance of responsibility hasno impact on the guideline range, thus discouraging guilty pleas. Critics assert that the flaw in the current guideline is that it embodiesan overly literal reading of 28 U.S.C. 994(h). Senator Kennedy, the originalauthor of this statutory directive, has recently observed that specificdirections to the Commission must be read in conjunction with the generalinstructions to the Commission in the Sentencing Reform Act in order toavoid unjust results. The Senator singled out 28 U.S.C. 994(h) as one provisionsusceptible to producing inadvertently unjust or anomalous results. The Commission is considering whether and, if so, how to revise the CareerOffender guideline. Three options have been preliminarily proposed. Thefirst two would create a new criminal history category, Category VII, forcareer offenders; the sentence would be tied to the offense level for theunderlying offense. The third is similar to the current approach, but wouldeliminate all judicial discretion.Under option 1, the sentences would start out 5 levels higher than forCriminal History Category VI, and generally would be about 2 to 4 yearslonger than for Category VI. However, at high offense levels, where sentencesexceed 10 years, category VII would gradually merge with Category VI. Inaddition, Category VII would not apply if Category VI would suffice toincarcerate the defendant beyond the age of 50, because (1) criminal careersgenerally do not extend beyond the age of 50, but if they do, the offensescommitted tend to be less serious than those committed by younger offenders;and (2) criminality is not a good predictor of future criminality beyond10-15 years. This proposal represents a first attempt to make more efficientuse of the career offender provision for incapacitation, while giving considerableweight to the seriousness of the crime(s) committed. Under option 2, the sentences would simply be approximately double thosefor criminal history Category VI.

The Commission interprets this as follows: murder, manslaughter,kidnapping, aggravated assault, extortionate extension of credit, forciblesex offenses, arson, or robbery are covered by this provision. Other offensesare covered only if the conduct for which the defendant was specificallyconvicted meets the above definition.

The Commentary to andSection; 4B1.3 captioned ``Background'' is amended bydeleting ``proportion'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``portion''. <T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purpose of this amendment is to providea better definition of the intended scope of this enhancement. <T3>Additional Explanatory Statement:</T3> Feedback from probation officersand others has pointed out that the current guideline is subject to varyinginterpretation. Compare, for example, U.S. v. Kerr, 686 F. Supp. 1174 (W.D.Penn. 1988) with U.S. v. Rivera, 694 F. Supp. 1105 (S.D. NY 1988). Thefirst prong of the proposed definition in application Note 2 above is derivedfrom former l8 U.S.C. 3575, the provision from which the statutory instructionunderlying this guideline (28 U.S.C. 994(i)(2)) was itself derived. <ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter Five, Part A_Sentencing Table </ITAG>247. <T3>Proposed Amendment:</T3> Chapter 5, Part A is amended in the SentencingTable by deleting ``0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4, and 0-5'' wherever it appears,and inserting in each instance ``0-6''. <T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> This amendment provides that the maximumof the guideline range is six months wherever the minimum of the guidelinerange is zero months. Related amendment: 257 (andSection; 5E4.2). <T3>Additional Explanatory Statement:</T3> The court has discretion toimpose a sentence of up to 6 months or a $5,000 fine for a Class B misdemeanor(Class B or C misdemeanors and infractions are not covered by the guidelines;see andSection; 1B1.9). It appears anomalous that the Commission guidelinesallow less discretion for certain felonies and Class A misdemeanors. Infact, in certain cases, a plea to a reduced charge of a Class B misdemeanorcould result in a higher potential sentence because the sentence for thefelony or Class A misdemeanor might be restricted to less than 6 monthsby the guidelines. This can happen when the Sentencing Table provides aguideline range of 0-1 month, 0-2 months, 0-3, 0-4, or 0-5 months. Thesevery narrow ranges are not required by statute, which allows a 6 monthguideline range in such cases. The Commission proposes to remove this anomaly by amending the guidelinetable to provide that whenever the lower limit of the guideline range is0 months, the upper limit of the guideline range is six months. There is a similar anomaly in the Fine Table at andSection; 5E4.2, in thatthe maximum of the fine table is, in certain cases, less than the $5,000authorized for petty offenses. Providing a fine range of $100-$5,000 foran offense level of 3 or less, and $250-$5,000 for an offense level of4 or 5, would remove this anomaly. Moreover, because the guidelines nowcover only Class A misdemeanors and felonies, an increase in the minimumfine guideline to $100 is proposed. andSection; 5B1.3 Conditions of Probation 248. <T3>Proposed Amendment:</T3> Section 5B1.3(c) is amended by inserting immediatelybefore the period at the end of the first sentence the following:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">``, unless the court finds on the record that extraordinary circumstancesexist that would make such a condition plainly unreasonable, in which eventthe court shall impose one or more of the other conditions set forth under18 U.S.C. 3563(b)''. <T3>Reason for Amendment:</T3> The purpose of this amendment is to conformthe guideline to a statutory revision. 249. <T3>Proposed Amendment:</T3> Section 5B1.3(a) is amended by inserting atthe end ``The court shall also impose a condition that the defendant notpossess illegal controlled substances. 18 U.S.C. 3563(a)(3).''.

Section 7110 of the OmnibusAnti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 confirms the authority of a sentencing courtto impose restitution as a condition of probation. Previously, such authoritywas inferred from 18 U.S.C. 3563(b)(20) (defendant may be ordered to ``satisfysuch other conditions as the court may impose'') and from legislative history.andSection; 5E4.2 Fines for Individual Defendants256. <T3>Proposed Amendment: </T3>Section 5E4.2(a) is amended by deleting:``If the guideline for the offense in Chapter Two prescribes a differentrule for imposing fines, that rule takes precedence over this subsection.''.Section 5E4.2(b) is amended by inserting at the end the following additionalsentence:``If, however, the guideline for the offense in Chapter Two provides aspecific rule for imposing a fine, that rule takes precedence over subsection(c) of this section.''.<T3>Reason for Amendment: </T3>The purpose of this amendment is to clarifythe guideline.

The court is required to impose an additionalfine sufficient to reimburse the government for the cost of imprisonment,probation or supervised release. The Commission solicits public commentconcerning the appropriateness of these provisions. Of particular interestis the manner in which the fine guidelines have been applied during theyear that the guidelines have been in effect. Public comment on these subjectswill also assist the Commission to fulfill its statutory mandate to studythe feasibility of requiring defendants to pay for the cost of punishment.(Section 730l of the Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988).andSection; 5E4.3 Special Assessments 259. <T3>Proposed Amendment: </T3>The Commentary to Section 5E4.3 captioned``Background'' is amended in the first paragraph by inserting at the end:``Under the Victims of Crime Act, as amended by section 7085 of the OmnibusAnti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, the court is required to impose assessmentsin the following amounts with respect to offenses committed on or afterNovember 18, 1988.
