The reaction is postulated to involve the intermediacy ofdifluorodioxirane, which transfers oxygen stereospecifically to the alkene.Ab initio calculations demonstrate that the difluorodioxirane is morestable than the corresponding carbonyl oxide and that closure of thecarbonyl oxide to the dioxirane should be rapid. The results of thesecalculations are compared to those on the parent CH{sub 2}O{sub 2} system.Reaction of carbon atoms with oxygen and alkenes in the absence of CF{sub3} gives nonstereospecific epoxidation presumably through the intermediacyof O atoms.</TEXT></DOC>
