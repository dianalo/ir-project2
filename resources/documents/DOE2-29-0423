VRTECH/PCgenerates cost reports by low-level waste stream, volume-reduction technologies,storage times, transportation distances, and burial charges. Its topdown,modular design provides flexible software which can be easily modifiedfor the user's specific problem. In addition, VRTECH/PC includes TASC'sScreen Generation Facility (SCF) software. SCF provides a user-friendlyenvironment for creating saving and recalling inputs for the proper operationof the program. VRTECH/PC was developed by the Analytic Sciences Corporation,Reading, Massachusetts under contract to the Electric Power ResearchInstitute, Palo Alto, California. 9 refs., 35 figs., 14 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
