SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush told tens of thousands ofdemonstrators today that abortion on demand is an ``Americantragedy'' and said he favors reversal of the landmark Supreme Courtdecision legalizing it.   Speaking by telephone hookup to activists gathered near the WhiteHouse on the 16th anniversary of the historic Roe vs. Wade decision,Bush said he believes that ruling ``was wrong and should beoverturned.''   The new president made the call shortly after Vice President DanQuayle also assured anti-abortion leaders that the newadministration supports their cause.   ``I wanted to share with you my deep personal concern about ourAmerican tragedy _ abortion on demand,'' Bush said.   ``I think America needs a human life amendment and I think whenit comes to abortion, there's a better way _ the way of adoption,the way of life,'' he said, adding:   ``I'm confident that more and more Americans every year _ everyday _ are hearing your message and taking it to heart. I promise youthat the president hears you now and stands with you in a cause thatmust be won. God bless you all and God bless life.''   Although the protestors cheered Bush with enthusiasm, Nellie Grayof the March for Life, an organizer of the rally, cautioned thecrowd on the Ellipse, off the White House grounds, that althoughthey could see the White House and hear Bush he could not hear them.   ``Unfortunately the White House staff chose to put in a one-waycommunications line,'' she said. ``He spoke to us but he could nothear us. That was not an adequate way to deal with our pro-lifemarch.''   Former President Reagan followed the same practice as Bush inpast years.   U.S. Park Police estimated that 67,000 people attended the rally,held in sunny, mild weather.   Talking to anti-abortion leaders earlier, Quayle noted that ``Ihave been involved with a lot of people in my state (Indiana) onthis issue. I couldn't think of a more appropriate group to bemeeting with.''   The noontime rally and a march to Capitol Hill culminated aseries of nationwide protests against the Supreme Court's 1973 Roevs. Wade decision that legalized abortion.   John C. Willke, president of the National Right to LifeCommittee, told reporters earlier that a non-sectarian campaign ofprayer is needed ``to help stop today's holocaust.''   Willke gave no details, saying individuals will have to work outwhat is comfortable for them.   ``All we can do is plant a seed and call for it,'' he said. ``ButI see tens of thousands of pastors ... tens of thousands points oflight on a prayer crusade.''   Quayle said he was delighted to sit down ``with variousconstituencies interested in the preservation of life.''   When a reporter asked whether the Bush administration couldsucceed in getting the Roe vs. Wade decision reversed, Quaylereplied, ``Time will tell. We have the same commitment.'' He said itwas important that someone stand up and speak for ``those people whoare not yet born.''   White House chief of staff John Sununu accompanied Quayle to themeeting, and the vice president said Sununu was there because hewanted to hear the visitors' views.   Willke said he had no problem meeting with the vice presidentinstead of the president and said he believes Bush ``will probablywalk in Ronald Reagan's mocassins on this issue.''   Leonard Dinegar of the National Right to Life Committee saidorganizers hoped to match last year's turnout of 50,000 people forwhat has become an annual reminder of the divisive issue.   The debate has taken on added intensity this year, with areconstituted Supreme Court considering a Missouri case with thepotential to result in significant changes in the legal doctrinegoverning abortion.   The Washington protest capped a series of demonstrations markingthe 16th anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade decision declaring thatwomen's privacy rights allow them to make their own decisions onabortion.   Anti-abortion demonstrators marched by the thousands in numerouscities on Sunday, in some cases confronted by advocates of freechoice in abortion.   More than 500 opponents of abortion were met at a PlannedParenthood office in Burlington, Vt., by 40 pro-choice demonstrators.   The two sides faced each other from across the street, with eachgroup singing, clapping and maintaining their distance.   ``Right-to-life is not a political issue,'' said Bishop JohnMarshall, the leader of Vermont's Catholic diocese. ``It is not amatter for the politicians to decide. It is a religious and moralissue already decided by God.''   In downtown Pittsburgh, about 1,200 pro-choice marchers joined a``March For Women's Lives.'' They were met at the Allegheny Countymorgue by about 40 anti-abortion marchers.   The pro-choice march was preceded by a rally at which EleanorSmeal, a former National Organization for Women president, said,``Some people want to save their souls by spilling the blood ofinnocent women. That isn't Christianity. It's hypocrisy. The churchhas no business dictating the policies of this country.''   After her remarks, many in the crowd turned, shook their fingersand yelled, ``Shame, shame, shame'' at the anti-abortion protesters,who stood across the street.   The Supreme Court has agreed to review a Missouri case in which alower federal court struck down a stringent state anti-abortion lawas unconstitutional. In its appeal, the state urged reversal of Roevs. Wade, and the Reagan administration filed a brief calling theMissouri case an ``appropriate opportunity'' to reconsider the Jan.22, 1973, decision.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh expressed hope on Sunday thatthe high court, with the addition of new Reagan appointee AnthonyKennedy, will use the Missouri case to overturn Roe vs. Wade.</TEXT></DOC>
