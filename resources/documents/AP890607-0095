Martha R. Seger, one of the Fed's seven governors, said theCommunity Reinvestment Act (CRA) ratings, if released publicly,could be ``misunderstood'' as a reflection of financial soundnessand ``undermine public confidence in the safety of deposits in aninstitution.''   Under the 1977 law intended to encourage the plowing of depositsback into lending for local needs, the Fed and other regulators nowrate banks, savings and loan associations and other depositinstitutions on a 1-to-5, best-to-worst scale.   Like commerical examination ratings, the CRA numbers have beentreated by regulators as confidential, although on occasion theyhave been used to challenge and deny a bank's application to expand.   Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee's subcommittee onconsumer affairs, Ms. Seger said the ratings were designed as a``supervisory shorthand to help us monitor those institutionsneeding closer attention.''   The number rating ``is in no way a self-explanatory indicator ofperformance'' and can be misleading, she said.   Nonetheless, she said, the Fed could support amending the 1977law to require it to regularly publish evaluations of each bank'scommunity reinvestment performance based on regulators' examinations.   The subcommittee is considering a series of bills by Sen. HowardMetzenbaum, D-Ohio, that would require publishing of the numericalratings and also make banks and other financial institutions cashgovernment checks of non-depositors and provide low-cost checkingaccounts to the poor and elderly.   Civil rights and community activist groups have called for theincreased disclosures in the wake of reports over the past two yearsof ``redlining'' by financial insitutions in Atlanta, New York andDetroit.   Redlining is practice by which banks and Sandamp;Ls have used zip codesand other geographic factors to systematically deny loans toresidents and businesses in areas with high concentrations ofminorities or poor people regardless of their credit worthiness.   ``Many lenders still don't accept an obligation to reinvestinner-city deposits in sound inner-city loans,'' said Gale Cincotta,executive director of the National Training and Information Center,a Chicago-based group that helps local organizations pressure banksfor CRA lending.   Cincotta said the entire rating system lacks credibility becausethe Fed and other regulators already give 1 and 2 _ excellent orgood _ ratings to 95 percent of the institutions.   ``Disclosing individual ratings of lenders would add to thiscredibility gap, and make it that much more likely that regulatorswould actually develop a meaningful and credible ratings system,''Cincotta said.   Trade association lobbyists have opposed Metzenbaum's bill,citing the arguments raised by both Ms. Seger and Cincotta as wellas a claim that community activists would use the ratings to exertpressure for granting unsound loans.   Metzenbaum tried to add the measures to President Bush's Sandamp;Lbailout bill when it was considered by the Senate in April butwithdrew them in the face of overwhelming opposition.   The banking subcommittee's chairman, Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill.,endorsed elements of Metzenbaum's proposal Wednesday but said healso was sympathetic to the arguments made by Ms. Seger againstdisclosing the numerical ratings.</TEXT></DOC>
