The static conductor surface gradient isused as the main variable in predicting corona performance of AC transmissionline. However, this method cannot be applied to DC transmission linesbecause the effects of space charges resulting from corona dischargevary with the conductor configuration and the polarity arrangement. Inthis study, the maximum conductor surface gradient, Fmax, in the presenceof space charge is introduced as the main variable and it is shown thatthe corona current, AN and RI at Fmax do not depend on the electrodesystems around a conductor bandle. Based on these results, this reportproposes a technique by which AN and RI generated by transmission linescan be predicted directly from results of corona cage tests. The introductionof the proposed method requires only the replacement of conductors inthe corona cage, permitting low-cost, efficient prediction compared toconventional techniques.
