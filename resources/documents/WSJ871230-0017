In the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, Edward Orlett of Dayton, Ohio, asked that the tender offer, which began Dec. 18 and expires Jan. 20, be voided and that damages be awarded in excess of the $6-a-share offer, the company said. Mr. Orlett, who couldn't be reached for elaboration, owns about 2,500 common shares of the Cincinnati-based company, which makes and markets electronic products, principally radar detectors. The company has 16.4 million shares outstanding.    Cincinnati Microwave, responding to the suit, maintained it has &quot;acted properly&quot; in making the offer and said it intends to &quot;vigorously defend&quot; itself.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Cincinnati Microwave shares closed at $4.75, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
