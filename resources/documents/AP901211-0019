President Vytautas Landsbergis, who met with President Bush atthe White House on Monday, told The Associated Press afterward theSoviets are not characterizing the step as a renewal of theblockade imposed after Lithuania declared its independence fromSoviet rule last March 11.   ``They are saying `we have nothing for you,''' Landsbergis saidin an interview. ``And everything we would have gotten, ourportion, is going to be divided up for everyone else. Nothing willbe left for us.''   He said the present dispute is over Lithuania's refusal to goalong with an economic plan that he said would return the republicto the control of Soviet central planners and impose a Sovietbudget, financial and tax system. The Kremlin also is demandingnearly all of Lithuania's foreign currency revenues, he said.   ``The Soviets have given us an ultimatum,'' he said. ``Since weare determined not to capitulate to the demands of that ultimatum,we don't know what consequences await us after the end of thisyear.''   The leader of the tiny Baltic republic said Lithuania is not asshort of food as other Soviet republics but that ``it could be verybad in the winter if the Soviets cut all the supplies, includingthe grain, heating oil, sugar, as they did during the blockade.''   He said he hoped his meeting with Bush, the first between a U.S.and Lithuanian president, would result in the United States issuinga statement ``that will stay the hand of the Soviets or even resultin a pledge from the Soviets that they are not going to usemilitary or economic violence against us.''   Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater issued a statement Mondaycalling for peaceful settlement of disputes between the Soviets andthe Baltic republics.   The statement said Bush expressed his hope that ``the Sovietgovernment would work constructively with Baltic leaders, withoutresorting to threats, intimidation or the use of force.''   Soviet foreign minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze was scheduled tomeet with Bush in Washington today, and Landsbergis said he wasconfident the subject would be raised.   The Lithuanians export meat to their neighboring Sovietrepublics, but Landsbergis said the threatened cutoff of feedgrains ``would destroy our agricultural system in months.''   He quoted a high-level Soviet official as boasting, ``You willslaughter your animals this winter.''   Landsbergis said it was not clear whether heating oil and otherpetroleum products also would be cut off.   Lithuania was practically brought to its knees earlier this yearwhen the Kremlin imposed a tough economic embargo in an effort toforce the republic to halt setting up its own border controls andtaking other steps to establish its independence from the SovietUnion.   The embargo was halted when Lithuania agreed to suspend steps itwas taking unilaterally and enter into negotiations with the SovietUnion toward establishing the republic's eventual independence.Little progress has been reported in getting the talks underway.</TEXT></DOC>
