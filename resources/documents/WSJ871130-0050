In downtown stores and suburban shopping malls across the country, many consumers displayed caution buying gifts, and shoppers appeared to be using credit cards less often, buying more traditional gifts and holding themselves to budgets.    In interviews, many said that although their personal financial situations hadn't changed, worries about a possible recession prompted them to rethink their spending plans in recent weeks.    Holiday purchases seemed to reflect a somber mood. Hot sellers included long skirts, Monopoly games and housewares. While expensive art books were big sellers in the past two years, this year a popular item is the Random House unabridged dictionary. Another hot-selling game is called Mid-Life Crisis.    Sales results were erratic from store to store and from one city to the next. In New York, shoppers jammed the sidewalks on Fifth Avenue. But at Northbrook Court, a pricey mall outside of Chicago, clerks stood idle as few customers seemed interested in buying.    At the Galleria mall in Sherman Oaks, Calif., merchants were unhappy with the post-Thanksgiving Day turnout from the surrounding middle-class neighborhoods. &quot;I was expecting a lot more customers,&quot; said Robert Reardon, manager of the C.H. Baker women's shoe store in the Galleria. &quot;It was massively crowded last year. But you just don't see the people walking around today.&quot;    In Boston, Thomas Hawley, manager of one of the 32 Underground Camera stores, said sales Friday were 30% lower than a year ago. &quot;We just didn't do too well this Thanksgiving,&quot; he said.    The sales picture was further clouded by deep discounting by many retailers. Although promotions and price reductions are common the first weekend after Thanksgiving, this year's were far more aggressive than usual. Sales of between 20% and 50% off were common at many of the big department store chains. And while these apparently helped to prop up buying -- enabling some retailers to ring up good results -- profit margins are likely to be hurt.    &quot;We're giving all our profit away, but we have to discount to get people in the store,&quot; said Larry Bromberg of Craig's, a women's apparel store at Northline Mall in Houston.    Moreover, to the extent that heavily advertised sales mask weak consumer demand, retailers may end up paying a heavy price later in the Christmas season. In the last two years, retailers have been saved from disappointing results by last-minute buying binges. If sales only encourage shoppers to buy earlier this year, then stores may have considerable difficulty matching last year's sales results.    Retailers have grown increasingly nervous about the Christmas season since last month's stock market crash. With personal debt at record levels, many retailers before the crash were already expecting an anemic five-week holiday season, which typically accounts for 25% of annual sales. The market's tumble raised the prospect of a downturn in consumer buying that could lead to a recession.    Over the weekend, many retailers appeared relieved merely that spending wasn't much worse. &quot;I was expecting people to be more hesitant, but no. It's been pretty good,&quot; said Pietro Esquetini, manager of Surrey's, a men's shop in the Dadeland Mall in Miami. He added, however, that sales were running below last year following Thanksgiving.    Others were enthusiastic about slight sales increases. Robert Lawson, chief financial officer of Fresno, Calif.-based Gottschalks Inc., described as &quot;spectacular&quot; a 9.1% jump in same-store sales for Friday and Saturday. &quot;We were all holding our breath,&quot; he said.    Despite the job losses and belt-tightening the market's crash has already caused in New York, shopping appeared strong there. The aisles of Macy's department store were so jammed Friday that one shopper said it took her 10 minutes to walk across the main floor. Battling the crowds on New York's Fifth Avenue was no less challenging. There were long lines of shoppers waiting to enter F.A.O. Schwarz, a children's toy store, and the fashionable Trump Tower. And there was no elbow room at the display cases on the main floor of Tiffany's.    Brian McMahon, vice president and general manager of Bloomingdale's flagship department store, said Friday was &quot;a very strong day. We saw no lack of willingness to spend a lot of money.&quot; He added that sales gains Friday for the 14 Bloomingdale's stores nationwide were about 12% over the same day last year.    But other retailers across the country said business was either slow or disappointing. (Perhaps concerned about adding to consumer worries, a number of major retailers this year departed from past practice and declined to disclose any sales information for the post-Thanksgiving weekend.)    A typical experience was that of Judy's Inc., a chain of clothing stores in Southern California. Marcia Israel, president, said Friday sales were &quot;very encouraging,&quot; but &quot;a bit spotty&quot; compared with the same day last year. For the most part, stores located in less competitive markets posted sales gains, while those in the most competitive areas showed declines. By Saturday, however, sales had flattened. &quot;For the most part it was on the nose with last year,&quot; Mrs. Israel said. &quot;Saturday didn't develop as well as we would have liked it to.&quot;    Marshall Field's, a Chicago-based chain of 25 department stores in Illinois, Wisconsin and Texas, got off to a good start Friday. Sales were 14% ahead of last year's levels. But on Saturday, sales fell below year-earlier results by a few percentage points, according to a spokesman, who blamed rain for the poor showing. In Nashville, Tenn., S. P. Braud, chief financial officer of Service Merchandise Co., said sales were flat compared with last year. The operator of 308 catalog showrooms didn't feature any unusual promotions this year, Mr. Braud said.    In Michigan, store sales rose just slighty more than the inflation rate, according to Arthur A. Nitzsche, president of Telecheck Michigan Inc., a check validating service. Mr. Nitzsche bases his estimate of a 4% overall sales increase on the volume of his business, factoring out the growth in his client base. He said retailers' decisions to cut prices now &quot;had a tremendous impact,&quot; and added: &quot;That was the name of the game.&quot;    Other stores said they did well only because of drastic promotional efforts. In Chicago, Carol and Irwin Ware, who operate fur salons at I. Magnin stores, worried about the sales effect of the market crash and on Friday, advertised a &quot;Bright Friday&quot; sale. The crash erased 22.6% of the market's value, so the Wares slashed price tags on their most expensive furs by nearly the same amount.    As a result of the promotion, sales Friday and Saturday totaled about $260,000 -- only 10% to 15% higher than last year. If he had run the same sale last year, Mr. Ware estimated sales would have been 30% to 50% stronger. &quot;There's a great deal of price resistance,&quot; he said. &quot;We're wondering what can happen to make people more optimistic.&quot;    Other retailers also launched big sales. Pittsburgh's local papers were filled with promotional ads throughout the weekend. David Weis, a discount retailer there that sells jewelry, appliances and household items, ran a &quot;28-hour supersale&quot; over the weekend, with items reduced 20% to 60%; Willi's, Herman's and Ski-Haus competed with sales on ski equipment; and Dahlkemper's ran sales promotions on stereo equipment, cameras and compact disc players.    In response, many consumers said they were hunting for bargains. Becky Fisher, a secretary at USX Corp., arrived at Kaufmann's Department Store in downtown Pittsburgh for its early opening at 8:30 a.m. Friday. &quot;So much merchandise is on sale, it doesn't make any sense to buy anything that isn't marked down,&quot; she said. Among the gifts she purchased: a sterling silver chain, marked down to $9.99 from $19.99; a sterling silver bangle bracelet, marked down to $15 from $50, and a pair of men's wool slacks, marked down to $59.90 from $100.    Overall, consumers seemed more conservative than retailers. Typical was Leah Wellman, a housewife from Indiana, Pa., shopping in Pittsburgh. &quot;I think I am more cautious,&quot; she said, adding that the market crash &quot;makes you wonder what's ahead.&quot;    Although most shoppers didn't lose money in the market, many said they had re-evaluated their Christmas spending plans, with some deciding to spend less than last year because they are worried about how they might fare in a recession.    Dawn Schneider, a 24-year-old fashion model who recently bought a house in Greenwich, Conn., for example, said she plans to be more frugal this Christmas because the crash is already spurring advertising cutbacks that might soon affect her job. And Urban R. Cleaves, 31, a law student who is apprehensive about the climate for student loans, plans to refrain from using his credit cards for buying gifts.    For many shoppers, being cautious means sticking to a budget, buying practical gifts and leaving home without their American Express cards. &quot;We'll not be extending ourselves,&quot; said Jeanneane Lake of South Lake Tahoe, Nev., who was shopping at Gump's in San Francisco.    As might be expected, shoppers who had losses in the stock market were even more pensive. Ed Richards, an investor from Houston who lost $17,000 Oct. 19 -- Black Monday -- was window shopping at Bloomingdale's in New York Friday, carrying a bag of gifts he had bought on sale at a Banana Republic clothing store. &quot;I'm being very selective,&quot; he said, &quot;not buying quite as much as last year. No impulse buying. Looking for sales. And no luxury items.&quot;    Virginia Burns of Denver, who was shopping in Pittsburgh with her brother and sister-in-law, barely looked at the merchandise at Saks Fifth Avenue. &quot;I lost money in the crash, and I'm going to have to be very cautious,&quot; she said. &quot;I'll go with a list and not do any impulse shopping, and buy with cash.&quot;    Still, some retailers noted consumer caution worked in their favor.    At Heffalump, a toy store in San Francisco's tony Marina district, sales were up 35% for this year's Thanksgiving weekend from last year. The store sells high-end, &quot;classic&quot; toys, such as wooden blocks, doll houses and rocking horses, many of them imported. It doesn't sell heavily promoted commercial toys. Owner Robert Meyer cites as one factor contributing to the upsurge: &quot;When people have financial worries, they are less likely to go for fads and gimmicks&quot; in toy selection, fearing that the toy won't hold the child's attention. Longer-lasting &quot;good toys are recession-proof,&quot; he said.    Despite the cautiousness of many consumers, some shoppers were charging full steam ahead. Gail Sizzlington, of North Reading, Mass., said she was prepared to spend more than ever on gifts this year, even though she lost &quot;a few thousand dollars&quot; in the stock market, and her job as a vocation counselor with a Boston school could be eliminated. Wearing a peach T-shirt emblazoned with the words, &quot;Get out of my way, I'm going shopping,&quot; Ms. Sizzlington, 34, asserted: &quot;People spend more money during festive times, such as Christmas, when times are bad and full of uncertainty. The rest of the year, they walk around in $8 dresses and stay home on weekends with the heater turned off.    &quot;I haven't turned my heater off yet,&quot; she added, &quot;but I'm willing to do that for a little cheer this holiday season.&quot;    William Goulet, a vice president of Gump's, agreed. &quot;This may be the last big Christmas for a while,&quot; he said. &quot;It's like having one last drink.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
