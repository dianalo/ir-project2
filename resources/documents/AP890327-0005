The voice and the picture of the world's 14 million politicalrefugees _ of whom it has been calculated that only three of every100 ever return to their homeland _ is brought home in a newlypublished photo book.   The book, ``Forced Out,'' represents an unusual collaboration byfour publishing houses and a foundation in an attempt to inspire aglobal movement on behalf of the human rights of refugees, oftenunwanted guests in unwelcoming camps. It consists largely ofaccounts by refugees of the sometimes bewildering, frightening orhopeless twists their lives took once they were forced from theirhomelands.   To a world inured to political disaster, the voices soundfamiliar.   A Salvadoran, describing how the National Guard conscripts boysfrom a sleeping village: ``No one could run that night, maybebecause the boys were still half asleep. `They are only going for ayear,' the members of the patrol would say to make us feel better,`and they'll be more civilized when we send them back. In thebarracks they learn to read and mind their manners,' they went on,without looking at anyone, addressing the stones that were us. Theyear was up but they never came back. No one comes back.''   An Ethiopian, resettled in Somalia: ``Arriving in the area ofsettlement we were scared to death. You feel lost. ... Never had weseen such thick forest, inhabited only by wild animals, snakes andbig, biting flies. Homeland was a beautiful place, full of grazingcattle. My dreams are still bound to my homeland.''   An Afghan looking for a new home: ``We were deported from theUnited States to Korea on March 29. They next day Korean Airlinestook us to Taiwan and then to Hong Kong. Hong Kong refused us andsent us back to Korea. The Koreans then sent us to Sri Lanka andtold the Sri Lankan authorities that we should be sent on toAfghanistan. The Sri Lankan government refused to accept us ... soKorean Airlines took us to Saudi Arabia.''   A Salvadoran: ``If we speak out, they kill us. If we'resuspected of speaking out, they disappear us. And if we keep ourmouths shut, they think we're hiding something. So they kill us forthat too.''   In one painful paragraph, a famous American doctor, Howard A.Rusk, describes how the body starves:   ``Nature becomes kinder to the starving at this juncture, kinderthan the politicians arguing about boundaries and power. A greatoverpowering lethargy develops, and a kind and wise nature offerslarge doses of sleep to ease the pain of slow death. In themeantime the body proteins have been depleted, the water andelectrolyte balance destroyed. The abdomen becomes distended withfluids, the extremities swollen with water, and now thedegeneration of the vital organs such as the liver and the kidneysstarts in earnest ...''   A Vietnamese boat person describes the desperation of thestarving: ``Our food and water ran out. No ship rescued us. `Pleasewait until tomorrow. I'll die. Then you'll eat me,' said Dao HuoCuong. Three of us pulled Cuong out of the cabin and held his headin water. Then one of us butchered him. Four others helped. Wecooked the meat in boiling water. I remember we prayed to the Lordbefore we killed Mr. Cuong.''   Principal author Carole Kismaric says political rather thannatural disasters create most refugees and most are forced fromtheir homes by their own governments, either for supporting rivalfactions or so that their land can be seized.   Bill Frelick of the U.S. Committee for Refugees, in an essay onhow countries accept or reject refugees, writes, ``Refugees areinconvenient. Their concern is not for order, systems orbureaucracies, nor for the general welfare. Their concern, rather,is for survival _ their own and that of their families.   ``Governments, on the other hand, have competing concerns: thesovereignty of borders, relations with neighboring countries,controlling immigration, promoting ruling ideologies, placatingpublic opinion. If offering asylum to a refugee is consonant withthose concerns, a government might come to his aid.''   ``Forced Out,'' a collection of photographs and first-personaccounts refugees, was commissioned by the J. M. Kaplan Fund,supporter of Human Rights Watch, which monitors the conditions ofrefugees. It was published in a collaboration by Random House, W.W.Norton andamp; Co., William Morrow andamp; Co. and Penguin Books, Ltd., withprofits earmarked for the Human Rights Fund.</TEXT></DOC>
