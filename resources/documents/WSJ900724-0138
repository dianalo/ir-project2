The loss reflects heavy charges forrecapitalization and restructuring, including a provision of$43 million for loan losses.   Meritor's year-earlier losses for the second quarter were$21 million, or 61 cents a share.</LP><TEXT>   Roger S. Hillas, Meritor chairman, said the results showed&quot;progress in long-term strategic restructuring of theinstitution.&quot; A debt-recapitalization plan approved byfederal regulators this month will increase Meritor'sshareholder equity by about $98 million, which will bereflected in the third quarter.   The plan will put Meritor in compliance with all the newcapital requirements under the thrift bailout law passed lastyear. Meritor, the nation's largest thrift in the early1980s, has shrunk nearly 70% to about $7 billion from $13billion.   Among the costs and charges in the quarter, Meritor had aloss of $74.5 million, or $2.12 per share, in connection withits sale of 54 branches to Mellon Bank Corp. Meritor alsowrote off $172 million in goodwill connected with the branchoffices sale, terminated interest rate swap and floorcontracts at a cost of $55 million and established a $54million reserve for expenses from unused office space.   Meritor also quadrupled its provision for loan losses froma year earlier to $43 million. A &quot;significant portion&quot; of theloan-loss provision is due to deteriorating commercial andreal-estate loans and Meritor's plans to accelerate thedisposal of non-performing assets, Mr. Hillas said.</TEXT></DOC>
