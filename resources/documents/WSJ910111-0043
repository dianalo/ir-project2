One big reason for their hesitation: The Bushadministration's Jan. 15 deadline for Iraqi troops towithdraw from Kuwait that could spell war in the PersianGulf.</LP><TEXT>   For many companies across the country surveyed by The WallStreet Journal, the Middle East crisis and whatever it maybring still seems far away. These businesses are moretroubled by problems caused by the recession, bank failuresand layoffs right here at home.   But for many other companies, the looming deadline hasbecome a lightning rod for their fears. The possibility ofwar in the Middle East brings with it the prospect of higherfuel costs, the loss of more people to a military call-up, afurther drop in consumer confidence and even threats to theirown personal safety as they travel abroad. Thus, many peopleare postponing plans until the outcome of the confrontationwith Iraq -- and its consequences -- are more clear.   &quot;Business hates uncertainty,&quot; says Juan de Carlo, aspokesman for Fibronics International Inc., a maker of fiberoptics communications devices. Mr. de Carlo says some of hiscompany's customers have decided to &quot;wait a little while&quot; onorders pending resolution of the Gulf situation. &quot;We've seena certain prudence.&quot;   For many companies, the effect of the Gulf crisis issimply to make a bad economic situation worse. The Jan. 15deadline is &quot;exacerbating recession fears&quot; says Engraph Inc.,a maker of packaging materials in Atlanta. Basil Ford, vicepresident, says customers already nervous about inventoriesare &quot;delaying taking goods until the last possible moment.&quot;   But for many other companies, the impact is far moredirect. The effect of uncertainty is especially keen forcompanies that use petroleum in their manufacturingprocesses. Dan Ciampa sits on the board of a rubber companythat has postponed the purchase of presses and ovens untilthe Gulf situation is resolved and their energy costs areclearer. Mr. Ciampa, who is also president of Rath andamp; StrongInc., a Lexington, Mass., consulting firm, says he seescompanies operating with contingency budgets that hold off oncapital purchases. &quot;Now they have two or three scenarios: `Ifthis happens, maybe we'll do A, and if that happens, maybewe'll do B.'&quot;   Ruth Stanat, president of Strategic Intelligence SystemsInternational Inc., a New York-based firm that marketsbusiness intelligence to large corporations, says she hasbeen &quot;specifically told&quot; by some clients, especially in thechemical industry, that buying decisions won't be made untilafter Jan. 15.   For her part, her response is &quot;look, wait and see.&quot; She ispostponing all discretionary spending on marketing, tradeshows, advertising and new literature. She has also canceledor cut back several planned European trips.   Businesses that depend on consumer confidence have alreadyfelt the impact of uncertainty. At Ladd Furniture Inc., afurniture maker in High Point, N.C., spokesman John Ong saysthat during the past six months, consumer confidence has beenbadly shaken by both recession fears and reports of layoffs.The result has been weak sales in the furniture business --and a loss of 1,200 jobs at Ladd. Now, he says, &quot;uncertaintyin the Gulf has made consumer confidence that much worse.&quot;   Mr. Ciampa consults for a consumer goods company whosebusiness is expanding, but which has left open 30 to 35positions pending resolution of the Gulf crisis. &quot;They areafraid that if there is a conflict, the situation will{change} so much that they will have hired people they don'tneed.&quot; The economy is playing some role, but he believes that&quot;if Baker and Aziz had worked something out, those decisionswould have been&quot; made to go ahead and hire people.   Other companies have less manpower out of necessity, notout of choice. John J. Cella, the executive vice president ofthe international division of Airborne Freight Corp., whichoperates under the name Airborne Express, said some pilotshave been lost to the Desert Shield operation because of thecall-up of reservists.   Fears of manpower shortages are causing some buyers todelay ordering, says Christopher Blundell, vice president ofCanterra Equipment Ltd., a Calgary, Alberta, equipmentmanufacturer that sells in the U.S. &quot;On three separateoccasions, guys have told me that some of their operators arein the National Guard, and they are scared they might losethem.&quot; Thus, he says, he hasn't received a half-dozen ordersthat he expected for drills used in detecting and removingunderground pollution. &quot;Under normal circumstances, theywould have happened in late November or early December.They're just sitting there waiting to happen,&quot; he says.   Other companies are delaying new ventures. Thomas L.Doorley III, a partner in Braxton Associates, a consultingfirm, says two potential clients in the defense industry areholding off on a strategic alliance to developdefense-related technology commercially. Mr. Doorley says thedefense companies' managers fear that their attention couldend up focused solely on a war.   Craig Schneier, a managing principal with consultantsSibson andamp; Co., in Princeton, N.J., says one client, afinancial services company in the Northeast, is postponing aventure with a European company with operations in the MiddleEast. &quot;They don't know what the assets of this company willbe after the shake-up,&quot; he says. A health care company in theSoutheast is waiting before proceeding with a venture with aEuropean company, because of the impact on the possibledemand for the health care company's services in Europeshould war break out.   At some companies, fears for their employees' safety aredisrupting normal business routines. At Minnesota Mining andamp;Manufacturing Co., a spokesman confirmed that &quot;due to theuncertainty in the Gulf, U.S.-based 3M employees traveling inEuropean countries have been asked to return immediately, andlikewise 3M employees traveling in the U.S. have been askedto return to their country of origin immediately.&quot; Allemployee travel between the U.S. and European countries isprohibited, and travel from the U.S. to any other country andother country-to-country travel &quot;will be approved on anexception basis only.&quot; The spokesman called the measure &quot;aprecautionary action designed to better insure the safety ofthe personnel,&quot; but wouldn't elaborate.   Even some companies that are proceeding as usual aremaking contingency plans. At Carolina Freight Corp., atransportation concern in Cherryville, N.C., Shawn Poole,treasurer and chief financial officer, says the first quarteris traditionally a slow period for the firm, and managementhasn't seen any unusual hesitancy among customers as Jan. 15approaches.   Carolina Freight itself, however, is taking someadditional precautions as it begins negotiations to purchasenew tractors and trailers. The company, which typically buysbetween 150 and 200 new tractors and about 1,000 to 1,500 newtrailers a year, normally takes new-equipment orders duringthe second and third quarters. But because of uncertainty inthe Gulf, &quot;we're negotiating so that we have the ability tochange those orders on short notice,&quot; says Mr. Poole. &quot;Wehave our eyes open.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
