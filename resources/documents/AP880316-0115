TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israeli police today detained an Arab-Americanpeace activist and a Palestinian was killed in clashes with troopsin the occupied territories, where Israel banned travel andlong-distance phone calls.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin defended Israel's move Tuesday tocut telephone links between foreign countries and the West Bank andGaza Strip, and to ban travel by Palestinians in the occupiedterritories.   The restrictions were aimed at hampering Palestine LiberationOrganization activists, whom Israel blames for keeping alive unrestthat has claimed 97 Arab lives since Dec. 8.   The army said one Palestinian died and six were wounded inprotests near Tulkarm, 40 miles northwest of Jerusalem. The armysaid the circumstances of the death were under investigation andthat no other details were available.   The Arab-owned Palestine Press Service identified the victim as60-year-old Salim al Yehyeh and said he died after soldiers threwtear gas into his home in a refugee camp on the outskirts ofTulkarm.   Hospital officials said Israeli soldiers shot and wounded eightPalestinians, six of them in the Gaza Strip and two in the WestBank.   Arab-American Mubarak Awad, 44, was being held at a city policestation after he was arrested for attending an illegal gathering,police spokesman Rafi Levy said. Levy said the illegal gatheringtook place on the main road between Jerusalem and the West Bankcity of Nablus, but he had no further details.   Last year, Israeli officials confiscated Awad's Israeli identitycard and ordered him out of the country in November, when histhree-month tourist visa expired. On Monday, Israel's Supreme Courtordered the Interior Ministry to show within 60 days why Awad hadnot been expelled.   Awad, a Palestinian who also has homes both in Jerusalem andWapakoneta, Ohio, came under fire after the publication in Hebrewof his book entitled ``Non-Violent Resistance: A Strategy For theOccupied Territories.''   The book urged the 1.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank andGaza Strip to refuse to pay taxes, lay down in front of bulldozersto prevent land confiscation and boycott Isreli products.   In other developments, a PLO-ordered general strike entered itssecond day today, keeping most Arab workers from their jobs inIsrael.   Rabin told high school students that nightly curfews in Gazawere necessary to ``reduce their (the Arab activists') capabilityto move by night, to prepare explosives ... to obstruct roads thatcarry workers to Israel.''   According to army estimates, about 2,600 Palestinians have beenarrested on riot-related charges, most for throwing stones.   The telephone and travel restrictions have a two-fold purpose:to demonstrate Israel's determination to regain control of thestreets and to keep Palestinian activists from receiving telephoneinstructions from abroad or from moving freely between the WestBank and Gaza Strip. Israel seized the territories in the 1967Middle East war.   The ban on direct-dial overseas telephone calls was not likelyto be completely effective, however, since it excluded Arabneighborhoods in east Jerusalem, where 130,000 Palestinians live.   The army-run territorial government will lift restrictions whenauthorities feel a change and the situation calms, informed sourcessaid.   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also held outthe possibility other steps would be taken, including the closingof West Bank bridges to Jordan. The bridges are an avenue for tradeand travel, and Israeli officials estimate more than 1 millionpeople cross annually.   The daily Hadashot newspaper today said authorities wereconsidering cutting off electricity to some areas, banning exportof some products and closing markets.   In recent days, the focus of the PLO campaign has shifted fromstreet confrontations to civil disobedience, such as theresignations of Arab police and tax collectors.   Israeli authorities each day this week have imposed newrestrictions on Palestinians.</TEXT></DOC>
