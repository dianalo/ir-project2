With campaigning for the 1988 nomination already under way, Mr. Kirk established a task force of party leaders to &quot;advise, admonish and -- if necessary -- publicly bring political pressure to bear upon any candidate, campaign or constituency group indulging in negative campaigning.&quot;    Chairmen of both major political parties have routinely urged presidential candidates not to criticize competitors from their own party. But Mr. Kirk's plan is an effort to prevent Democrats from endangering their prospects in the general election with &quot;self-inflicted political wounds&quot; just at a time when the Republican Party seems to be riven with strife.    &quot;Let negative campaigning find a home in the other party, where its economic elite will be doing battle with its radical right for control,&quot; Mr. Kirk said.    At the same time, Mr. Kirk's code was designed to prevent candidates from criticizing major constituencies such as organized labor in an effort to prove that a candidate possesses a sense of independence. In 1984, both Sen. John Glenn of Ohio and Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado, in efforts to establish themselves as representatives of a new Democratic Party, criticized former Vice President Walter Mondale for being the captive of labor &quot;barons&quot; and &quot;bosses.&quot;    &quot;All presidential candidates must resolve not to run against Democratic constituencies as a short-term and shortsighted campaign tactic,&quot; Mr. Kirk said in remarks to the National Press Club.    Mr. Kirk also urged the party's interest groups to refrain from basing endorsements on candidates' views on single issues. &quot;Narrow or single issue litmus tests cannot be the sole criterion,&quot; he said. &quot;Particular constituencies must resolve to broaden their own standards for support.&quot;    The party's two announced candidates embraced Mr. Kirk's code and his admonitions to prevent candidates from &quot;trashing our traditional base constituencies&quot; and &quot;bashing the party itself.&quot;    Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri commended the chairman &quot;for his efforts to focus the 1988 debate on issues and not personalities.&quot; Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona endorsed the plan and suggested that candidates give their rivals advance notice of criticism directed at them or their positions.    Mr. Kirk named six members to his new task force, which will determine whether candidates' ripostes are accurate, designed to inform the electorate rather than defame an opponent, and likely to improve rather than injure the party's prospects in the November election. Task force members are Sen. George Mitchell of Maine, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, Gov. Martha Layne Collins of Kentucky, former Gov. John Carlin of Kansas, Rep. Morris Udall of Arizona and Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania.    Mr. Kirk, hoping to prevent candidates from following the Rev. Jesse Jackson's 1984 lead by challenging party rules, urged presidential aspirants to recognize that the debate over delegate selection rules was &quot;closed.&quot; In a statement issued after Mr. Kirk's address, Mr. Jackson said that if he ran in 1988, he would &quot;run on the rules&quot; and wouldn't make them &quot;a major issue during the campaign.&quot;    The chairman also pledged his own &quot;strict and absolute&quot; neutrality in the race, repeated warnings against non-binding &quot;straw polls&quot; measuring the candidates' support, asked candidates to give &quot;unqualified support&quot; to the eventual nominee and urged the contenders to agree to participate in the party-sponsored debates and support the party's fund-raising efforts. </TEXT></DOC>
