(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A jury was chosen for the trial of twoformer PTL aides of Jim Bakker after a judge asked potentialpanelists if they contributed to a church or recognized luxurybrands like Cartier and Mercedes-Benz.   Twelve jurors and four alternates were selected Thursday to hearthe trial of David Taggart, 32, and his 35-year-old brother andhousemate, James.   They are accused of not paying $494,000 in income taxes from 1983to 1987 and of using more than $1.1 million of PTL money to paypersonal bills, including $55,000 for purchases from the Cartierjewelry store in New York.   The trial, scheduled to begin July 5, will be a prelude to theAugust trial of Bakker and Richard Dortch. The two former PTLleaders are accused of diverting more than $4 million in PTL moneyfor their own benefit.   David Taggart went to work at PTL in 1978 as an administrativeassistant to the television ministry's music director and soonbecame Bakker's most trusted aide. According to PTL records, he drewmore than $620,000 in pay in the 15 months ending March 1987, whenBakker resigned in a sex and money scandal.   James Taggart received nearly $300,000 during that period, whenhe was PTL's interior decorator.
