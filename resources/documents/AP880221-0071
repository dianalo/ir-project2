But Mrs. Aquino said on her weekly radio show that she hadrefused to let the ousted president go to his home province.   Mrs. Aquino also said she had been told of the coup plot againstMarcos that led to the ``People Power'' revolution Feb. 22-25 1986but she did not believe the planners would go through with it.   Mrs. Aquino said Sunday night that the role of the U.S. Embassyduring Marcos' final hours as president was ``making arrangementsfor Marcos to leave the country.''   Marcos has claimed he was kidnapped by U.S. authorities andtricked into boarding a plane, thinking he would be flown to IlocosNorte, his home province in the northern Philippines.   But Mrs. Aquino said U.S. Ambassador Stephen Bosworth called herthe evening of Feb. 25 to say the Marcoses would be flown to Clark.   After the Marcoses reached the base, Bosworth called her againand asked if they could stay overnight at the base and then fly toIlocos Norte for a rest, she said.   ``I said no, he can rest in Clark, but he has to leave firstthing in the morning. And so that was the agreement, and that waswhy Marcos and his family flew the next day to Honolulu,'' she said.   Mrs. Aquino invited listeners to join a ``Chain for Peace''during second anniversary celebrations Thursday along a roaddividing the two military camps where the revolt occurred.</TEXT></DOC>
