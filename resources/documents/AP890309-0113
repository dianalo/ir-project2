Gorbachev haswelcomed.   Just a few years ago, such open defiance of Moscow would havebeen unthinkable, and authorities would have moved in immediately toarrest any protesters who surfaced.   But now, on certain issues like the environment, glasnost _ orgreater openness _ is welcomed. Authorities are taking a moretolerant attitude toward protests, and in some cases are even goingalong with the public's demands.   In the Soviet Far East, at least three ports have refused toallow the nuclear-powered barge carrier Sevmorput to dock because ofconcern for possible radioactive contamination.   Soviet press reports have said tens of thousands of residentsprotested to a Pacific radio station, and city officials anddockworkers declared the ship unwelcome out of fear over nuclearpower that grew after the Chernobyl disaster. The public alsoapparently was upset that although it was newly built, the Sevmorputhad already developed cracks.   The weekly newspaper Moscow News said this week that Moscowministries are to blame for trying to maintain a ship that isuneconomical and failing to tell the public that experts hadcertified it is safe.   The daily Izvestia on Thursday told of yet another protestagainst a ship. It said residents in the Ukraine on the westernshore of the Black Sea are protesting plans to transfer onto bargeswhat they believe is hazardous cargo from the West German shipPetersberg. Dockworkers are also refusing to carry out theoperation, the newspaper said.   The April 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, whichkilled at least 31 people and sent a cloud of radiation worldwide,turned much of Soviet public opinion against nuclear power andbrought the issue to the top of the country's environmental agenda.   In December, government officials announced that six nuclearpower projects have been scrapped because of earthquake danger ortougher standards imposed after Chernobyl. Added to the list afterthe devastating earthquake in Armenia on Dec. 7 was the nuclearpower plant near the republic's capital, Yerevan. Armenian activistshad been demanding closure of the plant for years, but it was onlyafter the eartquake that authorities agreed.   Lithuanians particularly have been vocal about their oppositionto a nuclear power plant in their republic. In September, thousandsof people formed a human chain at the Ignalina Atomic ElectricStation to protest its threat to the environment. Authorities hadalready responded to earlier protests by ordering an end toconstruction of a third reactor at the plant.   In his travels, Gorbachev himself has been confronted withcomplaints from Soviets about the safety of nuclear power plants intheir backyards.   Last month, in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev _ not far fromChernobyl _ residents confronted the Kremlin chief with concernabout the safety of a nuclear power plant under construction on theCrimean Peninsula. Gorbachev was sympathetic, saying foreign expertshave been called in to review the plant's design and that it wouldnot be finished if the specialists determine it to be unsafe.   In a Feb. 23 speech in Kiev, Gorbachev said his democratizationof society has spawned a grassroots environmental movement that theKremlin must ``in all ways welcome.'' He noted millions of tons ofharmful chemicals are spewed into the air yearly, destroying arableland, vegetation and animals, and promised to ``completely overcomethe underestimation of the importance of ecology.''   Scientists must review every project to determine their expectedimpact on the environment, Gorbachev said, and a popular referendummust be held on each proposal.   The government is even welcoming help from the outside, sometimesfrom unexpected sources. The international environmental groupGreenpeace, which has organized protests against Soviet whaling,announced Monday it is negotiating the opening of a branch office inMoscow.</TEXT></DOC>
