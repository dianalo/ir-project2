The boom is expected to stretch over the next two to threeyears. That is good news for suppliers whose pipelinecontracts shelter them from the recession. It's also good forutilities and consumers that can't get enough natural gas.But some eager pipeline companies could be losers, if theirestimates of gas demand prove too rosy. The cost of the extrapipe could pinch their profits for years to come. Still, inenergy-hungry areas like New England, utilities say the addedcapacity won't be enough to meet demand.</LP><TEXT>   In California, the supply-and-demand outlook is murkier.Six pipeline companies are proposing to spend $3.5 billion tobuild new lines or expand existing facilities. One or two ofthem probably will drop out of the competition. But eventhen, the amount of additional gas flowing into the statecould be as much as double the 1.6 billion cubic feet ofadditional capacity that the California Public UtilitiesCommission calculates is needed by 1995.   &quot;Unless demand grows far more rapidly than we expect,there is every indication that California will becomeseriously overbuilt,&quot; says John Olson, an analyst withGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co. in Houston.   Regulators used to protect pipeline companies fromthemselves. They held lengthy hearings to make sure newprojects were likely to be viable. If demand for the gasdidn't match expectations, they allowed pipeline companies toincrease their transportation rates to cover the cost oftheir mistake.   But this is changing. As demand for natural gas grows,pressure builds for speedier, simpler regulatory procedures.   Elizabeth Moler, a member of the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission, says the regulatory body has begun to ask forless detailed data supporting applications to build newinterstate pipelines.   In return for faster approvals, she says, the pipelinecompanies take on more of the risk. If they can't get enoughgas to flow through the new pipeline, they and theirshareholders will have to fork over the difference to coverconstruction and operating costs. The FERC won't allow rateincreases in these cases, she says.   In California, at least three of the six proposed projectshave received or are applying for pipeline-constructionpermits on those terms. Their sponsors don't have to provethat there are firm buyers for all the gas expected to flowthrough the system. On the other hand, if analysts'projections of too much new gas come true, the pipelinescould be forced to take losses, either through cutting tollsto get business or by losing shipments to other pipelines.   Coastal Corp. a Houston pipeline concern, pulled the plugon a seventh pipeline project to serve California late lastyear. The company had placed orders for steel pipe before itfinally ceded the Wyoming-to-California route to rival KernRiver Gas Transmission Co., a venture of Tenneco Inc. andWilliams Cos.   &quot;There's just a boatload of cheap gas ready to move intothat market, and it's just not going to support all thesepipelines,&quot; says James Cordes, executive vice president ofCoastal. Risking operating a partly empty pipeline in thatmarket &quot;scared us a bit,&quot; he says.   In contrast, Tenneco, whose Kern River pipeline is beingbuilt under the relaxed regulatory rules, says the Californiamarket that it plans to serve is very solid.   &quot;I don't disagree that there are demand forecasts thatdon't match our own outlook&quot; says Rebecca McDonald, vicepresident, strategic planning, for Tenneco. But she saysKern, which will ship large quantities of gas to California'sgrowing enhanced oil recovery market, will be full of gaswhen it starts operations.   &quot;If we hadn't been {fully subscribed}, I don't think wewould have got financing,&quot; she says. &quot;This isn't a house inthe suburbs to be built `on spec.'&quot;   Roger Berliner, an industry consultant in Washington, saysthat as the regulators step back from making judgments on gasmarkets, bankers will be forced to make the call as to whichof the pipeline projects are most viable. &quot;The regulatorshave shifted the decision-making to the loan divisions offinancial institutions,&quot; he says. &quot;These are the folks whowill make the final decisions as to what gets built and whatdies.&quot;   If the situation in California points out the risks ofmassive pipeline expansions, the U.S. Northeast -- where $3billion of expansion is planned -- highlights the benefits.Utilities in New York and New England are seeing demand forgas in their service areas boom, and say there isn't enoughpipeline capacity available to deliver all that's needed.   Natural gas has become more popular for heating homes andgenerating electricity in the region. Utilities have comeunder pressure to shift from costly imported fuel oil, andthe alternatives to gas -- coal-fired plants or nuclearfacilities -- are seen as too expensive, too risky orenvironmentally unacceptable.   That demand is fueling the largest of thepipeline-expansion proposals, TransCanada PipeLines Ltd.'s$2.1 billion project to transport 831.5 million cubic feetdaily of additional natural gas to the New York border. Fromthere, the $583 million Iroquois Gas Transmission Systempipeline, a consortium of 13 partners led by TransCanada,will deliver the gas to buyers in New York and New England.   &quot;We're right on the knife-edge now as far as gas supplygoes,&quot; says Ed Sondey, vice-president of gas supply atBrooklyn Union Gas Co. While Brooklyn Union will get newsupplies of Canadian gas when Iroquois begins shipments inNovember, Mr. Sondey said those volumes won't meet all thegrowth in demand.   So Brooklyn Union, along with two other New York-areautilities and three pipeline companies, including Coastal,has formed a partnership to expand and add to existingpipeline systems from the usual supply sources in the U.S.Southwest. The total cost of the new facilities needed willreach about $300 million, he says.   A series of other projects have already been proposed tohelp access new sources of gas supply, principally in theRocky Mountains area.   To date, the major impact of all the pipeline expansionshas been seen among the businesses that serve the industry.   Stelpipe, the pipe-making division of money-losing StelcoInc., expects to more than double its production this year tomeet demand, says Gordon Rich, vice president and generalmanager.   Large suppliers aren't the only beneficiaries. In theslumping U.S. Northeast, work on the Iroquois pipeline hashelped boost businesss for such enterprises as hotels,restaurants, print shops and surveyors. And as Iroquois andother pipelines pass through the construction stages,construction workers, manufacturers of the compressors neededfor the pipelines and even landscapers will benefit.   Legislation is likely to continue spurring demand for newpipelines. &quot;The one-two punch is the Clean Air Law and theNational Energy Strategy now before Congress,&quot; says MichaelBaly, president of the American Gas Association, an industrygroup. &quot;We expect these . . . alone will create demand foranother two trillion cubic feet of gas a year&quot; from thecurrent level of 19 trillion cubic feet.   Mr. Baly points to provisions in the National EnergyStrategy and in other bills before Congress that would helpspeed up pipeline construction. While gas purchasers used togrill him about supply levels, now, he says, they just wantto be reassured that there's enough pipeline capacityavailable. &quot;This is going to keep pipeline construction athigh levels,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
