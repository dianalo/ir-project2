Broaduser requirements known as data consolidation, data independence anddata protection are highly considered in the fundamental system design.To realize the system a sophisticated data structuring method for thedata consolidation, a high level language for query facility and dataprotection methods for data security were developed. From the work adata bank named EDFSRS: Evaluated Data Files Storage and Retrieval Systemhas been developed, which is an operational data base system for theevaluated nuclear data libraries compiled in the major three formats:ENDF/B, UKNDL and KEDAK. This system consists of more than fifteen independentprograms and some 180 Mega-byte data files and index files (data-base)of the loaded data. It is designed to be operated in the on-line TSS(Time Sharing System) mode, so that users can get any information fromtheir desk top terminals available in these major three formats. Equippedfunctions are very wide from data loading up to data retrieval, datacalculations, data presentation in graphs, index book production andpreparation of user accounts. The constructed system is a stand alonesystem with a characteristic of self-contained system for a data basesystem thus it gains high portability for the transplantation to othermachines. This system is a reflection of user needs to consolidate datain secure, reliable way and to provide easy end-user access to thesedata.</TEXT></DOC>
