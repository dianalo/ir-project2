The bond market's bellwether security, the 8.125% 30-yearTreasury bond, rose about 1/4 point, a gain of about $2.50for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue's yield,which moves in the opposite direction of its price, eased to8.22% from 8.24% Friday. The gains extended Friday's powerfulrally, which was sparked by weaker-than-expected employmentdata.</LP><TEXT>   Traders said the timing of yesterday's advance, which theyattribute to an improved market climate, declining commodityprices and weak car sales data, was somewhat surprisingconsidering the Treasury is about to saturate the market withnew supply during the quarterly refunding of the federaldebt.   The refunding kicks off today with the sale of $14 billionof three-year notes, continues tomorrow with the sale of $12billion of 10-year notes and concludes Thursday with the saleof $12 billion of 30-year bonds.   Treasury yields often rise -- and prices often decline --ahead of the big quarterly bond auctions as investors worrythat the deluge in new debt will overwhelm supply and roilthe markets.   That fact that investors were willing to buy bonds aheadof fresh supply may indicate that &quot;some investors are fearfulthat they won't get {current high} yields if they wait forthe auctions,&quot; said William Sullivan, director of moneymarket research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Yields onlong-term Treasurys, which were stuck at or near 8.5% formonths, already have fallen 1/4 percentage point in the pastfew weeks.   Traders said much of the buying was by institutionalinvestors employing various &quot;yield curve extension trades.&quot;Essentially, these investors are betting that interest rateswill soon decline.   In when-issued trading, the yield on the 30-year bondended at 8.20%, down from 8.23% on Friday. The when-issued10-year yield ended at 8.01%, down from 8.04%; thewhen-issued three-year note ended at 7.00%, down from 7.02%.   Bond prices began the day little changed. Prices began torise in mid-afternoon, when Chrysler Corp. released dismalsales figures for July. Although Ford Motor Co. reportedstrong sales, the weak showing of Chrysler pulled the totalsales figures for domestically manufactured autos to lowerlevels than economists had forecast.   Domestically made autos are estimated to have sold at a6.7 million unit seasonally adjusted annualized rate.Analysts had expected an annualized selling rate in excess of7 million. The car sales data was just the latest in a stringof weaker-than-expected economic data.   On the inflation front, the Commodity Research Bureau'sindex of commodity futures prices fell 2.54 to 213.98. Thedecline, which eased inflation fears, was due largely to thedrop in grain prices attributed to rain in the Midwest.   Some analysts say bond market participants may be gettingahead of themselves as the refunding unfolds.   Michael Strauss, chief economist at UBS Securities Inc.,says recent gains have made the Treasury market expensive,creating the &quot;potential for a mini-repeat of what happened inMay.&quot;   At the May refunding, dealers underwrote the $37 billionpackage of new debt with apparent ease, only to watch yieldsratchet upward when retail demand didn't emerge in theafter-market.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          The barrage of new tax-exempt bonds scheduled to be soldthis week got off to a good start with a successful $102million offering by the Port Authority of New York and NewJersey.   Dealers said that New Jersey residents and tax-exempt bondfunds that specialize in New Jersey securities were bigbuyers of the consolidated revenue bonds.   Today, a Lehman Brothers group is scheduled to price $4.1billion of California revenue anticipation notes and aMerrill Lynch andamp; Co. group is expected to price $750 millionof New York City general obligation bonds.   Yesterday's offering of Port Authority bonds, priced by anunderwriting group led by PaineWebber Inc. and ratedSingle-A-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. anddouble-A-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., were priced toyield from 4.60% for notes that mature in 1992 to 6.83% forlong-term bonds that mature in 2026.   Due to the strong demand, a portion of the issue wasrepriced to lower some yields on zero-coupon bonds maturingin 2009 and 2011 by 0.05 percentage point. Zero-coupon bondsdue in 2009 were repriced to yield 6.65%, down from 6.70%,while zero-coupon bonds due in 2011 were repriced to yield6.70%, down from 6.75%.   Demand for tax-exempt bonds in New Jersey has always beenstrong, due in part to the lack of supply of securities thatare exempt from New Jersey state taxes. But demand hasincreased sharply since last year when the state raised itstop tax rate on individual income to 7% from 3.5%.   Although the bonds also are exempt from state taxes in NewYork, dealers said that interest from New York residents andbond funds was limited in the Port Authority offeringbecause, due to New York's financial problems and negativeinvestors' perceptions of its creditworthiness, New Yorkbuyers can purchase a range of tax-exempt bonds with higheryields than those seen on the Port Authority issue.   One dealer noted that similarly rated bonds, such assingle-A bonds from New York's Triborough Bridge and TunnelAuthority, generally carry yields about 0.10 to 0.15percentage points higher than those seen on the PortAuthority offering with similiar maturities.   The $4.1 billion of California revenue anticipation notes,which may be the largest municipal offering this year, isexpected to see strong demand from a mix of retail andinstitutional investors. The issue has already garnered topflight short-term ratings of MIG-1 and F-1-plus from Moody'sand Fitch Investors Service Inc., respectively.   Late yesterday, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. also assigned itshighest short-term rating of SP1-plus to the $3.1 billion offixed rate California notes. The remaining $1 billionportion, which haven't been rated, are variable-rate notes.   Price talk circulating late yesterday put the yield on thefixed rate California RANs maturing in June at 4.85%. Fixedrate RANS maturing in March are expected to carry a 4.75%yield.   New York City GO dealers expect the bonds to sell quicklybecause they will offer some of the highest yields availableon investment grade munis. Price talk circulating lateyesterday put the top yield on the tax-exempt bonds at 8.20%.The deal will consist of tax-exempt and taxable bonds as wellas zero-coupon securities.   Meanwhile, most actively traded municipal bonds finishedunchanged to 1/4 point higher, in line with Treasurys.   Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Prices of most Treasurys rose and yields declined onweaker-than-expected car sales data and declining commodityprices.   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of98 25/32 to yield 8.22% compared with 98 18/32 to yield 8.24%on Friday. The latest 10-year notes ended at 99 24/32 toyield 8.02% compared with 99 18/32 to yield 8.04%.   The Treasury sold $20.85 billion of shortterm bills at itsregular weekly auction. The average discount rate on thethreemonth bill was 5.51% and the average rate on thesix-month bills was 5.59%. The rates were down from lastweek's auction when they were 5.58% and 5.69%, respectively.   The average rate on three-month bills was the lowest sincethe average of 5.46% at the auction on May 28, 1991. The rateon six-month bills was the lowest since the average of 5.54%at the auction on July 13, 1987.   Here are details of yesterday's bill auction:                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it. Thepercentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while thecoupon equivalent yield is based on a 366-day year.                                                                                                                                         13-Week          26-Week Applications ............$33,266,860,000  $28,302,655,000 Accepted bids ...........$10,430,515,000  $10,424,720,000 Accepted at low price ...            65%              87% Accepted noncompet'ly.... $1,738,460,000   $1,476,835,000 Average price (Rate).....  98.607 (5.51%)   97.174 (5.59%) High price (Rate)........  98.617 (5.47%)   97.184 (5.57%) Low price (Rate).........  98.607 (5.51%)   97.174 (5.59%) Coupon equivalent........          5.68%            5.85% CUSIP number ............      912794XM1        912794XY5                                                                                                          Both issues are dated Aug. 8, 1991. The 13-week billsmature Nov. 7, 1991, and the 26-week bills mature Feb. 6,1992.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          Prices of investment-grade corporate bonds ended modestlyhigher, while high-yield, high-risk junk bonds finishedlittle changed.   About $850 million of new debt was offered in thecorporate market, the second straight session that debt saleshave been robust.   Among the companies that took advantage of that was FordCapital BV, which offered $500 million of seven-yearguaranteed notes priced to yield 9.084%. Ford Capital BV isthe Dutch-based offshore financing subsidiary of Ford MotorCo. The notes were guaranteed by Ford Motor.   Strong investor demand prompted underwriters led byMerrill Lynch andamp; Co. to boost the size of the Ford Capitaloffering from an originally planned $400 million.   In the junk bond arena, R.H. Macy andamp; Co. issues ralliedsharply after the giant retailer said that for the fourthquarter ended Aug. 3, its same-store sales were $1.633billion, up slightly from the $1.629 billion in the year-agoperiod. Same-store sales refers to sales in stores openduring the comparable year-ago period.   Despite the slight gain, Macy's said total sales for theyear fell to $6.761 billion from $7.267 billion a year ago.   Macy's zero-coupon bonds jumped three points to 46 whilethe company's 14.50% senior subordinated debentures, maturingin 1998, added three points to end at 79.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage securities prices ended higher.   In subdued secondary market dealings, Government NationalMortgage Association 9% securities for August delivery wereup 2/32 at 101 4/32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Gold 9%securities were 2/32 firmer at 100 27/32 and Federal NationalMortgage Association 9% securities were 2/32 higher at 10019/32.   A big increase in the Fannie Mae series 1991-108 realestate mortgage investment conduit deal resulted in anall-time record $2 billion agency Remic.   Fannie Mae says strong domestic and foreign demandprompted underwriter Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. to quadruple theoffering from its original size. The deal, which is backed byFannie Mae 9% securities, was initially put at $500 millionin late July before being hiked to $1.25 billion andsubsequently to $2 billion.   In June, Lehman Brothers and Kidder were engaged in anapparent competition for record agency Remic, as eachunderwriter bumped up the size of its offerings severaltimes.   Lehman eventually took the upper hand, underwriting a $1.7billion Fannie Mae deal, series 1991-82, which was alsobacked by the Fannie Mae 9% issues. Kidder's new Remic series1991-108 surpassed this prior record-sized agency Remic.</TEXT></DOC>
