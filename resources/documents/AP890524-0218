Rebukes South Africa's Claim of Namibia Rule</HEAD><BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United Nations on Wednesday rebukedSouth Africa for claiming it has primary authority over Namibiauntil the country gains full independence in November.   In a private briefing with the Security Council,Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar stressed that the UnitedNations has ultimate authority over military affairs in Namibia,diplomats who attended the meeting said on condition of anonymity.   The U.N. chief drew a clear line between South Africa'sresponsibility for local law enforcement and the Security Council'sauthority over any potential call-up of the territorial militia orthe South African army, they said.   In a letter to the United Nations, South African Foreign MinsterR.F. Botha said that responsibility for the administration ofNamibia through independence is the primary task of the SouthAfrican-appointed administrator-general. That includesresponsibility for maintaining law and order in the territory,Botha said in his letter, dated May 19.   South Africa agreed to a U.N.-mediated independence for Namibiathat began April 1 and is to culminate in elections Nov. 1. But theprocess was interrupted the day it began when hundreds of armedguerrillas from the South-West People's Organization crossed intoNamibia from Angola. In subsequent fighting, 316 guerrillas and 27South African security force members were killed.   Both said the administrator-general, Louis Pienaar, ``has theright to use such measures and means as he would deem appropriateto counter activities of an aggressive, violent or intimidatorynature emanating from whatever quarter.''   But African diplomats said they were concerned Pienaar wouldfeel free to recall the army to handle any new incursions by SWAPO,the main rebel group in the territory.   Under accords signed in December by South Africa, Cuba andAngola, Pretoria pledged to cooperate with the plan to make Namibiaan independent black majority-ruled nation.   Under the U.N. timetable, the 50,000 South African soldiers inNamibia were to withdraw by July 1, leaving only 1,500 troopersconfined to base. South Africa's U.N. Mission said Wednesday thattheir numbers in Namibia will be cut to 1,500 a week before theJuly 1 deadline.</TEXT></DOC>
