A 1975 border treaty could be the solution and for Iran there``should be no questions,'' said Alireza Deyihim, deputy dean ofIran's diplomatic academy that is affiliated with the ForeignMinistry.   He said in an interview that both countries had accepted the1975 pact and Iraq ``clearly violated international law'' when itabrogated the treaty unilaterally in 1979.   Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after a series of borderskirmishes.   Iran and Iraq agreed Monday to accept the United Nations's callfor a cease-fire. U.N. Security Council resolution 598 also statesthat both Iraqi and Iranian forces should withdraw ``to theinternationally recognized borders without delay'' after thecease-fire is in place.   Deyihim said Iran believes that phrase means the forces shouldwithdraw to the borders agreed upon in the 1975 treaty between Iraqand Iran's government of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi that wasoverthrown in 1979 in the revolt led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.   ``Both countries have ratified this treaty and announcedratification to the United Nations,'' Deyihim said. ``That treatysettled all problems including the border in the Shatt-al-Arab,''the 120-mile waterway that flows into the Persian Gulf and formsthe southern border between the warring neighbors.   Deyihim, who entered Iran's foreign service 17 years ago and wasinvolved in the 1975 treaty negotiations, said if Iraq had wantedto renegotiate parts of the agreement it could have used thecomplaints procedure that is part of the pact.   He claimed Iraq had removed many of about 570 markers set todelineate the 730-mile border after the 1975 treaty .   ``They removed them ... and even pulled out trees'' that markedthe border, he said.   ``We hope that this (border issue) does not cause a delay inimplementing the cease-fire.'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
