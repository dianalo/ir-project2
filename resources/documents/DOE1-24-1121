NCM6 and NCM7 differ only in the handling of coal-fired utilityplants. This Software Manual stands between the Model Description andFormulation document and the Users Manual and the three are addressedto different audiences. The Model Description and Formulation documentis addressed primarily to analysts although it contains important backgroundand reference material for the other two manuals. The Users Manual ismainly an operational manual, both for data maintenance and run submission.These two important but disparate aspects of model documentation havesometimes been mixed with software considerations, resulting in confusionto the user. This document is concerned almost exclusively with software.A model of the nature of the NCM inevitably takes its existence in theform of computer programs, files and procedures of considerable complexity.Although, generally speaking, this subject does not attract as wide anaudience as either the analytical description or the operational details,it is extremely important that it be explained clearly and neither beconfused by nor itself confuse other subjects.</TEXT></DOC>
