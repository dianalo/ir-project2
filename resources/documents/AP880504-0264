GAO found that there was little U.S. oversight of the programand confusion over which government agency should be in charge ofthe 1971 pact, which banned sales to foreign nations without U.S.permission and placed a cap on the number of rifles Korea couldproduce.   When presented with evidence of illegal foreign sales, U.S.officials usually instructed embassy officials to remind Korea ofthe ``seriousness'' of such sales. A strong, official governmentprotest was never lodged, GAO said.   The agreement included Colt Industries Firearms Division ofHartford, Conn., which set up the Korean rifle plant in exchangefor per-weapon royalties.   Government officials told GAO investigators that the program'smanagement ``was left largely to Colt.''   A State Department official close to the M-16 program agreedthere was some confusion over ``who was supposed to be watchingevery element of implementation and how much day-to-day watchingwas appropriate.'' The official said a ``more meticulous accountingarrangement'' may be necessary in the future.   But the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,defended the government's actions in following up on illegal saleevidence, saying an official government protest was not necessaryand that reminding Korean officials of the agreement had beensuccessful.   Colt sued Korea after the Connecticut company stopped receivingroyalties in 1982. That was the year the Korean government, whichoperated the plant, turned over ownership to Daewoo PrecisionInstruments, a private company.   The GAO report, a copy of which was obtained Wednesday by TheAssociated Press, said records show that Korea produced more M-16rifles and spare parts than allowed under the agreement. It alsofound that M-16s and parts were sold to third parties without U.S.permission, a violation of the agreement.   The third-party nations were not mentioned in the report, whichwas declassified. A Colt official said Tuesday that the company hadevidence of M-16 sales to Indonesia.   Sukhan Kim, a Washington attorney representing the KoreanDefense Ministry in the Colt suit, said Korean officials have toldhim neither the government nor Daewoo has sold M-16s or parts toother countries or violated the production cap.   He declined further comment, citing the pending litigation.</TEXT></DOC>
