Authorities believe that the most powerful members of these gangs deal directly with the international drug cartels, which supply them with cocaine and other narcotics.    The gang members in turn distribute the drugs through affiliates, who have spread from coast to coast in search of markets and new recruits. Members of the Crips and Bloods have been arrested for selling crack in 47 cities, and a recent Justice Department report says organized gangs now sell narcotics in every state.    The Bush administration has declared war on this spread of drugs, concentrating on beefed-up law enforcement. But many people think the chances of victory are slight unless the alienation of youths like Mr. Penn can be overcome.    Mr. Gray believes that &quot;institutional racism and double standards&quot; are what created the gang and drug problems, and that the Bush plan's emphasis on more law and order &quot;has nothing to do with the problem, so won't make any difference.&quot; Rather, he thinks the problem is that &quot;these kids feel locked out of the system.&quot; His solution is &quot;to give them a taste of being inside.&quot;    So far, he has succeeded with Mr. Penn, though neither is willing to proclaim victory. With funding from both his Omaha television station and a federal job-training program, the producer has taught Mr. Penn how to type, write copy, report and handle the technical aspects of television production.    &quot;The biggest moment for me,&quot; says Mr. Gray, was the day Mr. Penn opened his first weekly pay check for $122 -- roughly a tenth of what the teen-ager could make on a good day in the drug trade. &quot;He looked at me and said, 'This is the first time I have ever got money without having to look over my shoulder,'&quot; Mr. Gray recalls.    Mr. Penn, who dropped out of 10th grade last year, plans to enter a high-school equivalency program this fall while continuing to work part-time at the television station, KETV. He also has some new ambitions, far from his dream as an eight-year-old, growingup in Omaha, to emulate the gangsters of yesteryear. &quot;I'd kind of like to do what he does,&quot; he says, looking over at Mr. Gray.    Still, neither is sure that can happen. &quot;I'd say Robert's chances of staying out of trouble are about 70-30,&quot; says Mr. Gray. &quot;If he can stay out of the gangs, I think he'll be successful, if only because he's intelligent.&quot;    Mr. Penn says: &quot;I can't say I'm not going to do anything bad again. It's going to be hard.&quot; New pressures loom. His girlfriend, Antonia Valentine, just had their baby girl. &quot;It's mostly the money,&quot; he says, explaining the difficulty he faces in resisting a return to the drug business. &quot;Even the little money I have now, I feel broke.&quot;    Mr. Gray wants Mr. Penn to provide an example for others. &quot;What I had hoped, and it seems to be working partly, is that by helping a leader, a guy with charisma like Robert, the others would want to follow what he's doing.&quot; Since hiring the gang leader, Mr. Gray says, he has been inundated by calls from other Crips members who also want to get out and get employed. Unable to hire them himself, he refers them to local community groups.    His experience makes Mr. Gray believe the Bush administration is &quot;definitely not in touch with what is going on. What they need to do is to understand who these kids are and why they do what they do. Most of them don't want to be in it, but they feel they have no choice.&quot;    While Omaha is largely a comfortable middle-class community, its inner city is a vivid example of the environment that has nurtured the spread of the drug trade throughout the nation. Much of the black community, which constitutes about 15% of the city's 350,000 residents, is stuck in what educator and community activist Robert Faulkner, who grew up here, calls a &quot;dead-end street,&quot; with virtually no middle class and no upward mobility.    Many of the city's minorities originally came in the 1940s to work in meat-packing plants and railroads. But most of the packing plants have folded, and the railroads cut back on laborers. Currently, 30% of the population is unemployed in the three census tracts that form the heart of the city's largely black and impoverished north side. For those on welfare, the median income is $5,400 a year. With legitimate employment opportunities scarce, hopelessness plentiful and little local organized crime as competition, Omaha became the perfect environment for selling crack.    Ask Mr. Penn. &quot;This is the best city for selling dope,&quot; he says. Moving back and forth between here and Los Angeles, where he has relatives in the Crips, he helped establish the local crack trade, recruiting younger children to act as his lookouts, sellers, and couriers and equipping them with cellular phones, walkie-talkies and digital pagers.    &quot;It's a business,&quot; says Los Angeles County Police Sgt. Wes McBride. &quot;What they're doing is setting up distributional networks. Think of it as franchises.&quot;    When Los Angeles gang members first appeared in Omaha two years ago, &quot;It was almost as if they were doing a marketing study,&quot; says John Pankonin, supervisor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Omaha office, who admits that his agents are now &quot;just barely holding their own.&quot;    Within some 16 months, the city was facing what Rep. Peter Hoagland calls &quot;a crisis,&quot; a multimillion-dollar cocaine trade with gang-dominated violence to match. Omaha police say they keep no records of gang-related crimes -- a situation that critics say is part of a pattern of denial that initially let the city's guard down. But on one recent weekend of gang-related mayhem, Mr. Hoagland asserts, &quot;three people were shot dead, and six more were wounded. It is the most serious law-enforcement problem to face Omaha in my lifetime.&quot;    Omaha is a lucrative crack market, Mr. Penn says, because the relative lack of competition creates the potential for huge price markups. &quot;You can take a $20 rock {of crack} in L.A. and sell it here for $100,&quot; he says. By the time he dropped out of school last year, believing it was &quot;a waste of time,&quot; he was earning as much as $1,200 a day.    The lure of such financial rewards is almost impossible to counter, concedes the FBI's Mr. Pankonin. &quot;It's very frustrating,&quot; he says. &quot;What alternative have I got for them? What job have I got for a high-school dropout that will allow him to get up at noon and make $300 in the afternoon? I don't like to admit it, but they're pretty good capitalists.&quot;    In fact, many who work closely with the local gangs believe that they are siphoning off some of the smartest and most ambitious teenagers in the ghetto by offering them entrepreneurial opportunities they simply see nowhere else. &quot;What's open to me?&quot; is the way Mr. Penn puts it. &quot;McDonald's and Burger King? I can't deal with that,&quot; he says with disgust.    Such rationalizations infuriate some of those in the community who are working to counter the drug and gang problem. Mike Walsh, the chairman of Union Pacific Railroad, who has spearheaded a vigorous local business effort to raise $700,000 over the summer to provide positive employment and recreational alternatives to Omaha's inner-city kids, calls such reasoning &quot;a complete cop-out. It's no different than a stockbroker saying he can make a whole lot more money if he cheats.&quot; &quot;Don't tell me society won't give you a chance if you play it straight,&quot; he says. &quot;In every fast-food business in this town there is employment.&quot; But it is exactly this kind of employment that the gang members are rejecting.    Robert Armstrong, executive director of the Omaha Housing Authority, who has won a national reputation for his hard line against drug dealers in the public housing projects he manages, asserts, &quot;The gangs are offering opportunities to people who are being left out of the mainstream. These are young people whom society has decided are incorrigible, without the self-discipline or skills to work in a legitimate business.    &quot;What the gangs have done is taken these same individuals, and shown them how to conduct business -- how to buy wholesale, sell retail, do inventory and keep profit margins,&quot; Mr. Armstrong says. &quot;They also teach discipline -- how to pay your bills on time. The gangs are willing to do what no one else is: Train these kids.&quot;    Certainly Mr. Penn sounds quite businesslike about his former trade. &quot;I like math,&quot; he relates. &quot;I sure did use it hustling. We had to weigh the dope, and if you didn't round it out, but weighed it to the very last fraction, you could make a whole lot of money.&quot;    He is equally matter-of-fact about the violence he used to guard his market share. At his mother's home, he says, he kept &quot;a lot of guns.&quot;    &quot;The people in L.A. taught me how to shoot,&quot; he says. &quot;You know, if you don't shoot them, they're going to shoot you, so when I did it, I really didn't care. I just wanted to make sure that I did it right. I wasn't trying to scare people, I was trying to hurt them.&quot;    Asked if he killed anyone, Mr. Penn says only, &quot;No comment.&quot;    &quot;It never was fun though, hurting people,&quot; he says quietly. &quot;My Dad told me that it's either them or you -- and I just didn't want it to be me.&quot;    Sounding like some executives, Mr. Penn complains that the more successful he got, the worse his life grew. &quot;The more money I got, the more out-of-control my life got,&quot; he says. By the time he reached the age of 16, graffiti were appearing on Omaha walls with his name crossed out, a promise from enemies to kill him. The police also were hot on his trail. &quot;People don't realize that hustling's hard work. You got your police, and your enemies, and kids trying to take your dope. You're tense every day.&quot;    What was fun, evidently, was having the cash. He frittered most of it away very quickly, though. Afraid that it might be seized if he put it in a bank account, he stashed most of it with his grandmother, who he says &quot;didn't like what I was doing, but she knew what I was up to.&quot; He says his mother knew too. He spent much of his drug proceeds buying furniture and a television set for his mother and paying off the family bills, a situation experts say is typical of the way otherwise law-abiding families get corrupted.    He also spent much of his drug proceeds on legal fees for both himself and his buddies in the gang, a situation he believes &quot;bought my way out of jail.&quot; What comes through is a picture of a young man struggling to be a big shot. &quot;All I wanted,&quot; he says, &quot;was respect.&quot; He says he liked it when the younger kids would look up to him. &quot;They were all asking my advice.&quot;    Rev. Elizabeth Beamis, executive director of the Methodist Ministries here, who works closely with the city's disadvantaged, stresses that the gangs are not just about money, or just about belonging, though both are big draws. &quot;What they are really about,&quot; she asserts, &quot;is giving kids a sense of empowerment.&quot;    She believes that many of the youngsters she has seen feel excluded from the dominant culture. &quot;They are sophisticated, they realize that there is a two-tier economy, and that the haves are getting more every day.&quot;    Mr. Penn reflects both this sense of exclusion and a deep cynicism about the country, a mindset that gives him little stake in its laws. He believes that his teachers &quot;didn't give a damn&quot; about him and that the local police are corrupt, a charge Omaha authorities deny. He also has no faith in the political system.    &quot;Politicians,&quot; he says, &quot;I think they're the real gang members. Everyone knows that in this country money talks, and that politics is a money thing. It's the politicians who allow the drugs to come here. I mean if I can find the drugs, why can't they?&quot;    He also believes that those with enough money and influence are able to buy their way out of trouble. &quot;You just get yourself a good lawyer, and you don't have to serve time,&quot; he says. To a certain extent, Mr. Penn's sponsor, Mr. Gray, agrees. &quot;These kids aren't dumb,&quot; he says, &quot;they see it&quot; when the Department of Housing and Urban Development has a scandal, &quot;and no one goes to jail. They see it when the Reagan administration has more officials indicted than any other in history,&quot; and almost no one goes to jail. &quot;Believe me, they notice it when Oliver North just does community work.&quot;    &quot;What I want is to be happy,&quot; Mr. Penn says, dreaming for a moment, &quot;a big house, a pool, horses, satellite television -- to see China, and Mexico -- the American dream.&quot;    But he still sees himself as an outcast, just a step away from being an outlaw. &quot;Society is set up so that black people can't get ahead,&quot; he says bitterly. &quot;I'm not supposed to have the American dream and all that. I'm supposed to be in jail.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
