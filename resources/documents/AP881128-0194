Delebarre accused the Communist-led General Confederation ofLabor (CGT), France's largest union and the one which called thestrike, of waging ``a sort of union guerrilla warfare of harassment.This is not in the French union tradition.''   He said that besides paralyzing two lines of the regional expressrail network on Monday, striking transit workers blocked buses intheir terminals and flattened tires and sabotaged engines.   He said management of the Paris regional transit agency will bedirected to stop paying strikers' salaries and to start disciplinaryactions against those who broke labor laws.   More moderate unions have criticized CGT strike leadership, butsome members of other unions and non-union members are taking partin the walkout.   Transport Ministry officials said it will be Wednesday morningbefore the first 140 army trucks were available, with eventually 400vehicles and 1,000 soldiers to be put at the disposition of localauthorities to assure transport.   The government of Premier Michel Rocard has been unsettled by awave of strikes by nurses, postal employees, government officeworkers and other public service employees in recent months. ButRocard insists that inflationary wage increases cannot be allowed.   Socialist Party spokesman Jean-Jacques Queyranne said he wondered``if the CGT really wants negotiations to succeed and does it wantthe disruption to increase and the conflict to continue?''   CGT Secretary-General Henri Krasucki dismissed as ``completelystupid'' suggestions that the strikes were intended to increaseCommunist chances at the expense of the Socialists in next spring'smunicipal elections.   Delebarre asked, ``Why would taking hundreds of thousands ofriders hostage, which is what has happened, lead these riders tovote in the municipal elections for those who incited this kind ofunion guerrilla warfare?''   CGT members have said they want safety improvements andacross-the-board pay increases of $170 per month.   Besides stopping two of the four lines of the Regional ExpressNetwork, the strike also affected some Metro service, with between67 and 85 percent of the normal number of trains running on fivelines.   Michel Rousselot, director general of the transit agency, said onFrench TV no new negotiations were planned with the unionsrepresenting the workers.   The CGT-led strike was to last at least through Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
