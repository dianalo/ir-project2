The Department has now completedthat administrative review in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of theTariff Act of 1930 (``the Tariff Act'').<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Review</ITAG>Imports covered by this review are shipments of Israeli fresh cut roes.During the review period, such merchandise was classifiable under itemnumbers 192.1810 and 192.1890 of the Tariff Schedules of the United StatesAnnotated. This merchandise is currently classifiable under item number0603.10.60 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule.The review covers the period October 1, 1985 through September 30, 1986and twelve programs: (1) Government-Guaranteed Minimum Price Program; (2)Export Promotion Financing Fund; (3) Insurance from Israel Foreign TradeRisks Insurance Corporation (FTRIC); (4) Short-term Fuel Advances to RoseGrowers; (5) Government Funding of AGREXCO and Purchase of AGREXCO Shares;(6) Government Support of the Flower Board of Israel; (7) Rebate of ExportInsurance Premiums; (8) Long-term Industrial Development Loans to AGREXCO;(9) Encouragement of Capital Investment Law (Agriculture) (ECILA); (10)Preferential Shot-term Financing under the Export Credit Funds; (11) CashPayments to Growers for Greenhouses; and (12) Cash Payments to PackingHouses. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments Received</ITAG>We have interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminaryresults. We received written comments from the Government of Israel (GOI).<T3>Comment 1: </T3>The GOI contends that the deposit rate for the short-termfuel advances to rose growers should be zero. The Department verified thatthis program was terminated and that all of the short-term fuel loans werecompletely repaid by May 1986. Flower growers received no advances or loansthereafter.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree. For purposes of the cash depositof estimated countervailing duties, we determine the benefit from thisprogram to be zero. <T3>Comment 2: </T3>The GOI contends that the Department overstated thebenefit attributable to IFTRIC by using only the value of exports for whichIFTRIC payments were claimed instead of the total value of exports duringthe review period. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and have recalculated each company'sbenefit accordingly. We then weight-averaged the resulting benefits byeach company's proportion of total rose exports to the United States duringthe period of review. On this basis, we determine the benefit from thisprogram to be 8.48 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3><T3>Comment 3: </T3>The GOI argues that the Department erred in determiningthat government investment in AGREXCO through the purchase of shares is``inconsistent with commercial considerations, and, therefore, countervailable.''No government investing in a commercial venture has the same reason forinvesting or the same expectation as a private investor. Whereas the producerorganizations and growers receive an on-going return from their investmentin AGREXCO, the GOI's return on its investment in AGREXCO is commerciallyreasonable because it is prospectively valuable. In the event of the dissolutionof AGREXCO, its assets revert to the GOI for distribution after the individualshareholders are paid off at the nominal share value (original purchaseprice): the estimated value of AGREXCO's assets far exceeds the value ofany investment the GOI has made in AGREXCO. Furthermore, although the GOIdoes not itself use the services of AGREXCO, it is under an obligationto provide infrastructure to its citizens. In 1989, the rights of usageto the AGREXCO facility revert to the Airport Authority, <T3>i.e., </T3>the GOI. In effect, by building the airport facility withprivate as well as public money, the GOI has been able to build infrastructureat less cost to itself. Finally, if the Department requires that a governmentinvestment be made for the identical reasons and identical expectationsas a private investment, then the Department is fashioning a rule thatsays that every government investment in a commercial venture is a subsidy.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. We have consistently heldthat government provision of equity does not <T3>per se </T3>confer a subsidy. However, to consider a government investmentconsistent with commercial considerations, the government should expecta reasonable rate of return on equity over a reasonable period of time.As we stated in our preliminary results, the Israeli government can neitherreceive dividends nor sell its shares in a secondary market for more thantheir nominal value. Thus the government's rate of return as a shareholderof AGREXCO equity can only be zero. The fact that, in the event of dissolutionof the enterprise, the assets of AGREXCO would revert to the GOI is nota criterion by which a reasonable investor evaluates and chooses amongalternative investments. With respect to the GOI's obligation to provideinfrastructure and the use of its investment in AGREXCO to build infrastructureat less cost to itself, the GOI has neither defined how the rights of usagecould be considered a real return, nor provided us with information necessaryto assign an appropriate asset value to such rights. Because of the impossibilityof analyzing the costs and yield rates of an investment in fixed assetswithout information on depreciation, depletion, and capitalized costs,the ``rights of usage'' to the AGREXCO facility are an underfined and intangiblereturn.Furthermore, we have consistently held that government activities suchas building roads, ports, low-cost utilities, training centers, and plantsites, constitute bounties or grants only when they are limited to a specificenterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries. The IsraeliMinistry of Agriculture provided funds to AGREXCO specifically to financethe expansion of AGREXCO's air freight terminal at Ben Gurion Airport.While the airport facility is located on publicly-owned Airport Authorityland, it is leased exclusively to AGREXCO and no other enterprise or industryhas access to the terminal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Results of Review</ITAG>After considering all of the comments received, we determine the totalbounty or grant during the period October 1, 1985 through September 30,1986 to be 9.89 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3>The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess countervailingduties of 9.89 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments ofthis merchandise exported on or after October 1, 1985 and on or beforeSeptember 30, 1986.Further, due to the elimination of the Export Promotion Financing Fundand the Short-Term Fuel Advances Program, the Department will instructthe Customs Service to collect a cash deposit of estimated countervailingduties, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, of 9.44 percentof the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments of Israeli fresh cut rosesentered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the dateof publication of this notice. This deposit requirement shall remain ineffect until publication of the final results of the next administrativereview.This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1)of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and andSection; 355.22 of the CommerceRegulations published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on December 27, 1988 (53 FR 53206) (to be codifiedat 19 CFR 355.22).<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 18, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Eric I.
