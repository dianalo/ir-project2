Berry, president and CEO of SpaceSystems/Loral, the satellite manufacturer.andP;  &quot;From its fixed position abovethe equator, it has watched history in the making, and it has received andtransmitted countless worldwide news and entertainment events for livetelevision viewing by hundreds of millions of people simultaneously.&quot;andM;Since 1980, Space Systems/Loral has built 14 more INTELSAT V satellites, thelast one launched in January 1989.andP;  Thirteen of them are still operating.andO;Two other INTELSAT V satellites were lost in launch vehicle failures.andM;INTELSAT's global system carries more than half of all internationalcommunications traffic to telephones, televisions, teletypewriters andhigh-speed data services around the world.andP;  Thanks to INTELSAT, more than abillion people can simultaneously watch an important international eventlive, via satellite.andM;The INTELSAT V series enabled the introduction of new service applicationsand more flexible earth station configurations, allowing the use of smallerantennas closer to the customer.andP;  The new INTELSAT V series made possible thewidespread use of digital technology and the world's first globally availableofferings that match new standards for an integrated services digitalnetwork.andM;Space Systems/Loral is under contract to deliver five next generationINTELSAT VII spacecraft, which will be launched beginning in 1992.andM;The new, high-power INTELSAT VII satellites will provide greater capacity andcoverage.andP;  They incorporate independently steerable C-band spot beam antennasthat will help increase traffic; a third antenna to extend K-band service tonew geographic areas; and zone switching to allow more flexibility inconfiguring coverage.andM;INTELSAT is an international not-for-profit commercial cooperative of 119member nations that owns and operates the global communications satellitesystem used worldwide by countries for their international and domesticcommunications.andM;Space Systems/Loral, based in Palo Alto, California, primarily manufacturestelecommunications and weather satellites.andP;  Space Systems/Loral is a unit ofLoral Corp., a high-technology company concentrated in defense electronicsand space communications.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
