Shultz told adelegation of American Jewish leaders Wednesday he believes theformation of a new coalition government in Israel could providemomementum to the Middle East peace process, a participant in themeeting said.   Reporting on the meeting, Morris Abram, chairman of theConference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations,said the secretary feels that the newly formed Likud-Labor coalitionwas better for the peace process than a ``narrowly basedgovernment.''   Much of the meeting, which lasted more than an hour, focused onShultz's decision last week to open a dialogue with the PalestineLiberation Organization.   Abram said the meeting was held to express the ``very deepconcerns'' of American Jewish leaders about recent administrationmoves in the Middle East.   He indicated that the delegation came away reassured by whatShultz had to say.   Abram said Shultz told the delegation that the initial contactslast week with the PLO did not constitute negotiations but ``a verylow level dialogue.''   He added that Shultz is not pressing Israel to undertake anydealings with the PLO.   Abram indicated he disagreed with suggestions by some StateDepartment officials that the statement last week by PLO ChairmanYasser Arafat recognizing Israel's right to exist, in effect,superceded the policy enshrined in the PLO covenant calling forIsrael's destruction.   Abram said the only way the PLO could legitimately retreat fromthat policy would be for the Palestine National Council to amend thecharter.   Shultz agreed, Abram said, that he ``would like to see thatdone.''   ``The secretary was extremely firm in his statement that nothingwhatsoever had changed with respect to American policy with respectto the Middle East and the state of Israel,'' Abram said.   ``He reaffirmed the following: this government does not want anindependent Palestinian state and he laid out the reasons, sayingthat such a state would be unstable and would be a threat not onlyto Israel but to the whole area.   ``He stated, furthermore, that the policy of the United Statesgovernment remained very firm that Jerusalem should remain a unitedcity. He spoke passionately of his abhorrence of terrorism, and hisdetermination that terrorism must cease.''</TEXT></DOC>
