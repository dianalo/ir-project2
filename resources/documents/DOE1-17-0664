It is shownthat short exposures (tau/sub e/ = one-half to one half-life) give minimalone-year error. The possibility is considered of the detection of thesolar neutrino flux variation due to annual changes of the Earth-Sundistance. The integral method of treatment of the experimental data isdescribed. Results are given of the statistical treatment of computersimulated data.</TEXT></DOC>
