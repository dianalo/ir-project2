L. 99-500 (approved October 18, 1986),Pub. L. 99-591 (approved October 30, 1986), making appropriations as providedfor in Part C of Title V of H.R. 5313, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986) (aspassed by the House of Representatives and by the Senate), to the extentand in the manner provided for in H. Rep. No. 977, 99th Cong., 2d Sess.(1986). For ease of reference, this rule refers to the Emergency ShelterGrants program established by the Homeless Housing Act of 1986 as the ``1986ESG program.''On July 22, 1987, President Reagan approved the Stewart B. McKinney HomelessAssistance Act (Pub. L. 100-77) (the ``McKinney Act'') reauthorizing withamendment the Emergency Shelter Grants program.\2\<NOTE/> A proposed rule for the 1987 ESG program was published onNovember 6, 1987 (52 FR 42664). Under section 416(a) of the McKinney Act,HUD is required to operate the 1987 ESG program (and, thereafter, the ongoingESG program) in accordance with the 1986 requirements until this finalrule takes effect.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ For ease of reference, this rule refers to the EmergencyShelter Grants program authorized by the McKinney Act as the ``1987 ESGprogram.''However, because the Department perceived that certain McKinney Act provisionsrequired immediate implementation, a series of notices was published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>. On August 14, 1987, the Department publisheda notice (52 FR 30628) implementing the Comprehensive Plan requirementscontained in Subtitle A of the McKinney Act. On September 4, 1987, theDepartment published a notice (52 FR 33790) identifying the McKinney Actprovisions that it intended to implement immediately, as well as thosethat would take effect under the final rule. Finally, on October 19, 1987,the Department published a notice (52 FR 38864) implementing the authorityto waive the 15% limitation on essential services by units of local government.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Public Comments and Changes Made in the Final Rule</ITAG>The Department received six public comments in response to its November6, 1987 proposed rule. There follows a discussion of these comments anda review of the changes made in the final rule, both in response to publiccomments and to internal departmental initiatives.Restriction on the Use of Grant Amounts with Respect to Buildings Ownedby Primarily Religious Organziations  In the final rule for the 1986 ESG program published on October 19, 1987,HUD modified its original ban on the use of grant funds to ``renovate,rehabilitate, or convert buildings owned by primarily religious organizationsor entities.'' The Department determined that the use of ESG funds forsuch capital improvements would be constitutionally permissible under certainconditions. One of these conditions required that the building (or portionof the building) to be improved with ESG funds be leased to a wholly secularentity, although the lessee could enter into a management contract authorizingthe lessor religious organization to operate the facility.  The Department believes that this construct strikes a careful balance betweenavoiding constitutionally impermissible assistance to religious entitieson the one hand, and allowing Emergency Shelter Grant funds to be usedto renovate, rehabilitate or convert buildings owned by primarily religiousorganizations. This belief is supported by the fact that only three commentswere received when this approach to the issue was again used in the proposedMcKinney Act ESG rule published on November 6, 1987.  Moreover, one of these commenters_the Baptist Joint Committee on PublicAffairs (BJCPA)_<T3>opposed</T3> relaxing the provisions that now enable religious organizationsto undertake capital improvements under the ESG program. The BJCPA wasparticularly critical of andSection; 576.21(c)(2), which provides that grantamounts may be used for the rehabilitation or renovation of buildings ownedby primarily religious organizations only if ``the building (or portionthereof) that is to be improved with the grant amounts has been leasedto an existing or newly established, wholly secular entity.''  The BJCPA contends that the words ``(or portion thereof)'' authorize theuse of Federal funds for capital improvements of mixed-use facilities.It asserts that while it might be constitutionally permissible to use publicfunds to renovate a separate building that is religiously owned but whollydedicated to a secular purpose, a mixed-use facility with a lessor religiousorganization operating the shelter ``makes a mockery of the First Amendment'sprohibition against government programs which directly and immediatelyadvance religion.''  Conversely, New Castle County in the State of Delaware objected to therequirement contained in the proposed rule that a secular entity must beestablished before grant amounts can be used to renovate, rehabilitateor convert a building owned by a primarily religious organization. It arguedthat a secular entity is not constitutionally required, and that adequateFirst Amendment protection can be provided by requiring an agreement betweenthe grantee or State recipient and the nonprofit recipient, stipulatingthat the premises are to be used solely for secular purposes.  The City of Indianapolis also criticized the proposed capital improvementrestrictions as they pertain to primarily religious organizations. It urgedthat the restrictions be made ``more flexible'' to allow ``more discretionon the part of local officials'' to determine whether use of the fundsby a religious organization violates the constitutional mandate for separationof Church and State.  As previously discussed, the Department has undertaken an exhaustive constitutionalanalysis regarding the proper nature and scope of the capital improvementrestrictions contained in the ESG program. It is the Department's viewthat the requirements established in this rule provide sufficient safeguardsagainst providing impermissible assistance to religious organizations (<T3>e.g.,</T3> through the establishment of a wholly secular entity toreceive the benefit of the ESG capital improvement funds, with any residualvalue of improvements reverting back to the original grantee if the propertyis not maintained as an emergency shelter for at least the useful lifeof the improvements), while still enabling religious organizations to respondto the urgent need for homeless shelters. Consequently, the Departmenthas adopted the proposed requirements of andSection; 576.21(c)(2) withoutmodification. Continued Use RequirementsThree comments were received opposing the continued use requirements establishedunder andSection;576.73 of the proposed rule. The City of Portland objectedto the proposed requirement that any building in which ESG amounts areused to undertake activities described at andSection;576.21(a)(3) (<T3>i.e., </T3>maintenance, operation costs, insurance, utilities, furnishings)must be maintained as a shelter for the homeless for not less than threeyears. This objection was based on the assertion that Federal subsidy programshave historically required continued use requirements only as a conditionof capital expenditures, and not for purposes of operating subsidies. A similar view was expressed by New Castle County, which commented thatwhile the use of ESG funds for major rehabilitation or conversion shouldinvoke the 10-year use requirement specified in andSection;576.73, the activitieslisted at andSection;576.21(a)(3) should not trigger any use requirement,since they do not constitute ``a direct improvement to the shelter's physicalplant.'' New Castle would require, instead, that the grantee provide comparableliving space (either in the existing shelter or in some other facility)for the applicable regulatory period.On the other hand, the Minnesota Department of Jobs and Training (MDJandamp;T)objected to such language when included at andSection;576.51(b)(2)(iv)(A)for emergency shelters located in commercial facilities. Under that provision,the grantee (or State or nonprofit recipient) is required to execute anagreement with the provider of the commercial space that comparable livingspace will be available for use as an emergency shelter in the facilityfor at least the applicable period specified in andSection;576.73. The MDJandamp;Tcontended that such a requirement is unreasonable, given the fluctuatingdemand for the housing, and should not be made applicable to commercialfacilities. Section 415(c) of the McKinney Act provides that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Each recipient shall certify to the Secretary that * * * it will <T3>maintain any building for which assistance is used </T3>under thissubtitle as a shelter for homeless individuals for not less than a 3-yearperiod or for not less than a 10-year period if such assistance is usedfor the major rehabilitation or conversion of such building * * * (Emphasisadded).</ITAG>Upon reconsideration, the Department has determined that this statutorylanguage triggers a use requirement only for ESG activities that involvecapital improvements to the shelter facility (<T3>see </T3>andSection;576.21(a)(1) of this final rule). Specifically, astatutory three-year use requirement would be imposed whenever ESG fundsare used to renovate a building for use as an emergency shelter. A 10-yearuse requirement would apply whenever ESG grant funds are used to undertakethe major rehabilitation or conversion of a building for use as an emergencyshelter. The Department will continue its policy to exempt from any use requirementthe provision of essential services under andSection;576.21(a)(2). While HUD has determined that the use requirements under the McKinney Actare limited to activities involving capital improvements, it is imposinga <T3>regulatory </T3>(rather than statutorily mandated) three-year use requirementon the leasing of commercial facilities to provide emergency shelter. UnderandSection;576.51(a)(2)(iv), emergency shelters located in commercial facilitiesmust be rented for a period of at least three years (either the identicalspace, or comparable rooms). In the event of a dramatic and unforeseenshortage in the availability of emergency shelters (i.e., in the case ofa natural disaster), the grantee or recipient may apply to HUD for a waiverof the three-year use requirement. However, it should be noted that whereESG grant funds are used for the renovation, major rehabilitation or conversionof hotel or motel space to facilitate its use as an emergency shelter,the three- or ten-year (as applicable) <T3>statutory </T3>use requirement under andSection;576.73 continues to apply.For activities under andSection;576.21(a)(3), other than the leasing of commercialfacilities, the Department is imposing a <T3>regulatory </T3>one-year use requirement in place of the three-yearrequirement included under the proposed rule. The Department's intent inimposing this one-year requirement is to provide consistency and continuityin the provision of emergency shelter services to the homeless. The MDJandamp;T commented that the definition of ``emergency shelter'' containedin the proposed rule_with its emphasis on providing temporary shelter forthe homeless_is at odds with the practice in Minnesota of using ESG funds``to rehabilitate permanent housing.'' The Department believes that thereis no inconsistency between the definition of emergency shelter providedin the proposed rule and the fact that permanent housing is being rehabilitatedunder the program. The ESG program is intended to provide temporary shelterfor the homeless, without any requirement that the shelter itself be ofa temporary nature. In fact, the continued use requirements establishedin this rule are designed to ensure a certain degree of continuity andpermanency in the provision of shelter services to the homeless. As a result,the Department has retained the definition of ``emergency shelter'' withoutmodification. The MDJandamp;T also requested that the term ``obligated'' be clarified inthe final rule to indicate that a grant award by a unit of local governmentto a private nonprofit organization under a written agreement <T3>requires payment from the grant amount. </T3>Since the proposed definitionof ``obligated'' incorporated similar language with respect to granteesand State recipients that undertake certain types of actions (<T3>e.g., </T3>place orders, award contracts, etc.) the Department hasmade the requested clarification at andSection;576.3 of this final rule.With regard to the limitation on units of local government to provide essentialservices (andSection;576.21(a)(2)(i)(B)), MDJandamp;T requested a modificationof the current standard. It contended that the proper standard should bewhether there is a quantifiable increase in the level of a service beyondthat provided by the unit of government during the 12 calendar months immediatelybefore it received <T3>initial </T3>grant amounts. This modification was urged on the basisthat it would be unreasonable to expect an increase in essential servicesabove that attributable to ESG funding. The Department agrees with, andhas adopted, this suggestion. The New York State Department of Social Services (NYS) asserted that therule is ambiguous as to whether the 15 percent limitation applies strictlyto units of local government, or whether no more than 15 percent of theentire State allocation can be used to provide essential services withoutthe State requesting a waiver. The Department wishes to clarify that the15 percent limitation applies to the <T3>total </T3>of each grant amount provided to a unit of general localgovernment. It is not necessary, in each instance, that an award by a unitof local government to a nonprofit recipient comply with the 15 percentlimitation. Consequently, although there is no direct limitation on a nonprofitrecipient's use of grant amounts for essential services, a unit of localgovernment may have to impose such restrictions on one or more of its nonprofitrecipients to ensure that the unit of local government is itself in compliancewith the 15 percent limitation. NYS also objected to the proposed rule's prohibition on the use of ESGfunds for the acquisition or construction of emergency shelters, and urgedthat proposed new construction not exceeding a 25 percent increase in squarefootage be considered an eligible expense under the program. In light ofthe fact that the McKinney Act does not provide for ESG grant funds tobe used for acquisition or construction expenses, the Department does nothave the discretion to modify this aspect of the rule. However, it shouldbe noted that the definition of ``rehabilitation'' (andSection;576.3 of thisfinal rule) includes additions to existing buildings when such additionsare incidental to the rehabilitation of the building. With regard to the requirement under andSection;576.23 that a State makeavailable its ESG formula allocation to units of local government in theState, the MDJandamp;T commented that Minnesota has found it extremely difficultto carry out this obligation. It asserted that because of the scatteredmigrant and farmworker population across some 57 counties, Minnesota wasexperiencing considerable difficulty in making ESG funds available to thissegment of the homeless population. MDJandamp;T requested a waiver of therequirement so that the State of Minnesota could contract directly withfarmworker organizations. While the Department appreciates the additionalburden involved where a State is required to deal with a highly dispersedhomeless population, the requirement that a State make available its ESGallocation to units of local government is statutory and, as such, is notsubject to waiver by HUD.New Castle County urged the Department to require States to notify eachunit of local government of the availability of ESG funds. The Departmentdid not adopt this suggestion, since administrative funds are not providedunder the ESG program to reimburse States for this expenditure. The Departmentis aware, however, that States have made substantial efforts to advertisethe availability of ESG funds, and believes that discretionary activityof this kind should be encouraged.New Castle County also suggested a modification of the proposed requirementat andSection; 576.31(a)(2) that ESG reallocated funds can only be made availableto units of local government that are non-formula cities and counties,and to private nonprofit organizations, if the jurisdiction in which theproposed activities are to be located has a Comprehensive Homeless AssistancePlan (CHAP). The suggested language would require a CHAP for ``* * * thejurisdiction in which the proposed activities are to be located or theservice area of the proposed location * * *''.The Department has instead adopted a modification of this suggested language.Under Subpart A of the McKinney Act (dealing with CHAP requirements), section401(f) refers to a CHAP certification ``* * * for the jurisdiction to beserved by the proposed activities * * *''. In this final rule, andSection;andSection;576.31(a)(2) and 576.51(b)(2)(i) have been modified to parallel this statutorylanguage. This rule will require the following: (1) A State, formula cityor county, or Territory that is applying for ESG funding for the proposedactivities would provide the CHAP certification that the proposed activitiesare consistent with the Plan; (2) in the case of a formula city or county,there must be an additional certification that before any of the grantfunds are used for an activity conducted outside the applicant's jurisdiction,the applicant will secure and provide to HUD a certification that the proposedactivities are consistent with the CHAP submitted by one of the following:(i) If the activity is conducted within the boundaries of a city or urbancounty having its own CHAP, then a certification from the appropriate officialof that jurisdiction; or (ii) if the activity is not conducted within aunit of local government having its own CHAP, a certification from theappropriate State official.Another comment concerning the CHAP was NYS' request that all entitiesreceiving direct entitlements under the ESG program be required to submittheir CHAPS to the State for purposes of certifying consistency with theState CHAP. The Department has not adopted this suggestion. The emergencynature of the ESG program clearly dictates that funds be allocated as expeditiouslyas possible, as evidenced by McKinney's 30-day mandatory review period.To require formula cities and counties to submit their CHAPS for reviewto the State, as well as to the local HUD field office, would be inconsistentwith the legislative intent reflected in the McKinney Act and, consequently,has not been adopted in this rule.New Castle County suggested that certifications of CHAP consistency thatare submitted to local HUD field offices under andSection; 576.51(c) (substantialchanges in the proposed use of ESG funds), provide for a 30-day reviewperiod. If, at the expiration of the 30-day review period, HUD fails torespond to the certification, it should be considered approved. The Departmentbelieves that this suggestion is consistent with the legislative intentto expedite the use of ESG funds and has made the necessary revisions inthis final rule.The MDJandamp;T objected to the requirement under andSection; 576.51(b)(2)(ii)of the proposed rule that a State must describe the sources and amountsof matching supplemental funds in its interim report. Its objection wasbased on the fact that nonprofit recipients, which may provide supplementalmatching funds, may not have ``drawn down'' available ESG funds at thetime the State is required to submit its interim report. This comment misconstruesthe matching supplemental funds requirement. Initially, it should be notedthat it is not required under the ESG program that matching funds be providedby a nonprofit recipient. When the grantee is a State, the matching fundsmay be provided by the State's own resources, or through funds providedby a State recipient. Matching funds can also include amounts spent onactivities that are ineligible under the ESG program, such as expendituresfor building acquisition or staff costs related to operating an emergencyshelter. Consequently, it is not necessary that the nonprofit recipienthave ``drawn down'' ESG grant funds at the time the State is required tosubmit its interim report and, accordingly, the Department has retainedthe proposed requirement without amendment.The 65-day deadline for States to make ESG grant funds available to theirState recipients (under andSection; 576.55(a) of the proposed rule) was objectedto by NYS on the basis that it failed to take into account the competitiveapplication process used to obligate the funds. The Department disagrees.It is imperative that ESG funds be obligated as rapidly as possible. TheDepartment's experience has been that the 65-day deadline is reasonable,and that most States are able to comply with it. If a situation arisesin which a grantee believes that complying with the 65-day deadline isimpossible, it should request a waiver of the requirement under andSection;576.5 of this final rule.The MDJandamp;T requested that the criteria listed under andSection;576.55(a)(2)for determining when a State recipient has timely obligated ESG grant amountsshould also be specified for ESG funds expended by a third party (<T3>e.g.,</T3> one other than the initial State recipient). The Departmentbelieves that this commenter has misconstrued the requirement to obligategrant funds under this provision. Section 576.55(a)(2) requires that <T3>``[E]ach State recipient</T3> must have all grant amounts obligatedwithin 180 days of the date on which the State made the grant amounts availableto it''. (Emphasis added). The 180-day obligation deadline does not attachto third parties that receive ESG grant funds from the State recipient.Consequently, there is no need to specify criteria establishing when thethird party has obligated its ESG grant funds.New Castle County urged that lead based paint removal under andSection;576.76(c)of the proposed rule be considered an eligible expense, regardless of whetherESG funds are being used to otherwise renovate, rehabilitate, or converta particular room. It bears noting that the Department has always consideredthe abatement of lead based paint to be an eligible rehabilitation activityunder andSection;576.21(a)(1), so long as the relevant use requirements underandSection;576.73 are satisfied.Section 576.83 of the proposed rule authorizes the payment to a granteeof an initial capital advance for 30 days' cash needs, or an advance of$5,000, whichever is greater. Thereafter, the grantee is reimbursed forthe amount of its actual cash disbursement needs. NYS commented that becauseof the shortage of working capital (particularly in the case of nonprofits),each grantee should be given a 25 percent advance against which claimscan be submitted when goods or services are received. This suggestion wasnot adopted because it would be inconsistent with the U.S. Treasury Departmentrequirements (see Fiscal Requirements Manual andSection;6-2075.20) whichnormally require a working capital advance to cover cash requirements fora period not to exceed 30 days.New Castle County expressed concern over the timing of the annual performancereport (andSection;576.85(b)(2)) which, under the proposed rule, must besubmitted no later than 30 days after the December 31 cutoff date. Thiscommenter cited two alternative reporting dates: (1) Allowing the ESG grantyear to coincide with the local fiscal year; or (2) allowing the annualreporting period to coincide with the grantee's CDBG reporting period.The Department has not adopted either of these alternative dates for submissionof the annual performance report. It is anticipated that the date establishedin the 1987 proposed rule will provide a uniform reporting cycle that willenable HUD to report to Congress on the progress of the ESG program inmeeting the needs of the homeless.Finally, the U.S. Department of Justice provided comments to HUD on ruleprovisions related to persons with handicaps. The phrases ``handicappedindividual'' and ``transitional housing for the mentally ill'' have beenrevised in this final rule to read ``individuals with a handicap'' and``persons with mental illness'', respectively.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Regulatory Changes</ITAG>On its own initiative, the Department wishes to make the following clarificationsor changes in this final rule implementing the 1987 ESG program.Under andSection;576.21(c)(2), grant amounts may not be used to renovate,rehabilitate or convert buildings owned by primarily religious organizationsunless the lessor of the building enters into a binding agreement requiringthe lessee to retain the use of the leased premises for a wholly secularpurpose for at least the useful life of the improvements. In the eventthis requirement is not satisfied, the lessor is obligated to pay the lesseean amount equal to the residual value of the improvements. Under paragraph(vii) of this section, the lessee must remit this amount to the originalgrantee from which the ESG amounts were derived. The Department wishesto clarify that, following the close of the ESG grant period, these fundsare to be used to alleviate homelessness in the original grantee's jurisdiction(i.e. to ``further the objectives of this part''), but that it is not necessarythat the grant funds be used in conformance with the requirements of theESG program. This language has been included at andSection;576.21(c)(2)(vii)of the final rule.The Department has modified the proposed requirement at andSection;576.43(b)that any allocation to a metropolitan city or urban county of less than.05 percent of the amounts appropriated for the ESG program <T3>for any fiscal year,</T3> would be added to the allocation for theState in which the city or county is located. The revised language providesthat reallocation will occur whenever there is an allocation to a metropolitancity or urban county of less than .05 percent of each appropriation underthe ESG program in any fiscal year. This revision more accurately reflectsthe actual allocation of ESG program funds, which is initiated upon theappropriation of funding under the program and <T3>not</T3> necessarily at the conclusion of the fiscal year.In andSection;576.85, the Department has changed the period for a State tosubmit its interim performance report from 90 days from the date of a State'sdistribution of funds to its recipients, to 30 days. HUD does not believethat there is any advantage in providing an additional two months for theState to submit its interim report, and that it would be better to coincidethe time allowed for submission of the interim performance report withthat of the annual performance report under paragraph (b)(2).In addition, while the Department retained the proposed timing for submissionof the annual performance report under andSection;576.85(b)(2), the provisionhas been modified to state that the final report is to be submitted 90days after all ESG funds are expended and all activities are completed.This final rule includes clarifying language to indicate that staff costsrelated to providing essential services are eligible ESG expenses underandSection;576.21(a)(2). (It should be noted, however, that the regulationalready provides that staff costs related to the <T3>operation</T3> of the shelter under andSection;576.21(a)(3) are <T3>not</T3> eligible expenses.) This raises the issue whether a proratedportion of a staff member's salary can be considered an eligible expenseif the staff member is providing an eligible activity, such as maintenanceor an essential service. For example, if a shelter operator provides transportationfor shelter residents by driving the shelter's van, can that portion ofhis or her time spent on this transportation service be considered an eligibleexpense? The answer to this question is ``no''. The payment of a shelterstaff member's salary_whether or not a portion of the staff member's timeis devoted to providing an eligible activity_should not be considered aneligible expense. Because the Department believes that, in most shelters,the operator typically provides a variety of services and functions, todetermine otherwise would compromise the statutory prohibition.Finally, for the sake of clarity, the Department is modifying the languageof andSection;576.21(a)(2)(ii) relating to the 15 percent limitation on theprovision of essential services by units of local government. Clarifyinglanguage has also been added to andSection;576.21(b)(i) relating to waiverof the 15 percent limitation. These clarifications are intended to reflectthe following: No more than 15 percent of the <T3>total</T3> of each grant amount provided to a unit of local governmentcan be used to provide essential services under the ESG program. However,a unit of local government is not required to comply with the 15 percentlimitation with regard to each grant amount provided to a nonprofit recipient,so long as the limitation is observed for the total grant award. Furthermore,the 15 percent limitation may be waived if the unit of local governmentis able to demonstrate that:(1) Activities other than essential services (<T3>e.g.,</T3> renovation, major rehabilitation and conversion activitiesunder andSection;576.21(a)(1), and operating expenses under andSection;576.21(a)(3))are already being adequately provided by the unit of government throughprivate or public resources. These resources may include that portion ofeach ESG grant amount provided to the unit of local government under thispart for which a waiver is not being requested; and(2) The amount that the unit of local government proposes to use for essentialservices_and that exceeds the 15% limitation_cannot practicably be usedfor eligible ESG activities other than essential services.The following example is illustrative: Assume that a unit of general localgovernment has $100,000 in emergency shelter grant amounts and wishes tospend 20 percent of this amount ($20,000) on essential services. The unitof government is free under section 414(a)(2)(B) of the McKinney Act tospend 15 percent ($15,000) on essential services, so that this amount isautomatically excluded from any waiver determination. To qualify for awaiver for the additional $5,000 that the unit of government proposes touse for essential services, it must demonstrate to HUD that:Other shelter grant activities under andSection; 576.21(a)(1) and (a)(3)are already adequately provided from public and private resources (whichresources may include that portion of each ESG grant amount provided toa unit of local government under this part for which a waiver is not beingrequested_$85,000); and(2) The $5,000 cannot practicably be expended for activities other thanessential services.Waiver requests from units of general local government receiving grantamounts from a State would first have to be forwarded to the State. TheState would be required promptly to forward all such requests to HUD, togetherwith any recommendations or other comments the State may have. This wouldgive States an opportunity to give HUD the benefit of their views on theirrecipients' requests for waiver, while ensuring that State recipients'requests will receive full and prompt attention by the Department.Lead-Based PaintSection 566 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (Pub.L. 100-242, approved February 5, 1988) amended the Lead-Based Paint PoisoningPrevention Act, and mandated that HUD publish a final rule amending theDepartment's lead-based paint standards at 24 CFR Part 35. On June 6, 1988,the Department published this final rule in accordance with the statutorymandate (53 FR 20790).The primary changes resulting from the 1987 Housing Act are: (1) A uniformrequirement that lead-based paint standards apply to all housing constructedbefore 1978; and (2) that the definition of ``applicable surfaces'' beuniformly expanded to include all interior and exterior surfaces.The revised lead-based paint standards affect the 1986 and 1987 ESG programsin the following manner. For purposes of the 1986 ESG program, HUD's October19, 1987 final rule (52 FR 38864) adopted, by cross-reference, the lead-basedpaint requirements contained in 24 CFR Part 35. As a result, the revisedlead-based paint standards under Part 35 will apply automatically to all1986 ESG program funds.Similarly, the 1987 ESG program (and, thereafter, the ongoing ESG program)incorporates by cross-reference the lead-based paint provisions containedin Part 35, with two additional requirements (both of these requirementswere contained in the Department's proposed 1987 ESG rule). These additionalprovisions relate to inspection and abatement of defective lead-based paintsurfaces and require that the grantee (or in the case of States, the Staterecipient): (1) Undertake treatment of defective paint surfaces beforefinal inspection and approval of any renovation, rehabilitation or conversionactivity under the ESG program; and (2) take appropriate action to protectshelter occupants from the hazards associated with lead-based paint abatementprocedures.NondiscriminationTwo of the nondiscrimination requirements with which use of emergency sheltergrants must comply as provided in andSection; 576.79(a) are Title VIII ofthe Civil Rights Act of 1968 and Executive Order 11063, which prohibitdiscrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, ornational origin. It may well be that some emergency shelters assisted underthis program are not actually covered under these authorities. The prohibitionsagainst discrimination in Title VIII relate only to a ``dwelling'', whichis defined in section 802(b) of that Act to mean, in part, ``any building,structure, or portion thereof which is occupied as, or designed or intendedfor occupancy as, a residence by one or more families * * *'' (the word``family'' includes a single individual). Judicial interpretations (e.g.,<T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Hughes Memorial Home, </T3>396 F. Supp. 544 (W.D. Va. 1975)) regardingwhether a temporary residence is a ``dwelling'' within the meaning of TitleVIII appear to turn on whether the occupant of a place intend to remainfor a substantial period of time or whether the place is rather one oftemporary sojourn or transit visit. A similar issue arises under ExecutiveOrder 11063, which covers certain ``housing and related facilities''. Sincethe operation and usage of emergency shelters may vary greatly across thenation, it seemed prudent to deem these authorities generally applicableto shelter assisted under this program.In any event, under andSection; 576.79(a), all such shelters are subjectto the Federal statutory prohibitions against discrimination with respectto race, color, national origin, age, sex and handicap in programs involvingFederal financial assistance. Consistent with the statutory intent of TitleVI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title VIII of the Civil Rights Actof 1968, the Department has included in this final rule a requirement atandSection; 576.79(a)(6) that the ESG grantee (or in the case of a State,the State recipient) make known that emergency shelter facilities and servicesare available to all on a nondiscriminatory basis. Where the proceduresthat a grantee (or State recipient) intends to use are unlikely to reachpersons of any particular race, color, religion, age, sex or national originwithin its service area who may qualify for ESG services, the grantee (orrecipient) is required to establish additional procedures to ensure thatthese persons are made aware of the availability of the facilities andservices.Under andSection; 576.79(a)(2), all shelters covered by this part must complywith the prohibitions against discrimination against otherwise qualifiedindividuals with a handicap under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Actof 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations to be codified at24 CFR Part 8 (53 FR 20215, June 12, 1988). Subpart C of 24 CFR Part 8sets forth detailed program accessibility requirements for both housingand non-housing facilities. The Department believes that shelters are ``housingfacilities'' within the meaning of 24 CFR Part 8. Accordingly, 24 CFR 8.22(New Construction_housing facilities), andSection; 8.23 (Alterations of existinghousing facilities) and andSection; 8.24 (Existing housing programs) applyto grantees in the emergency shelter grants program. Specifically, 24 CFR8.22 and 8.23 require that a percentage of newly constructed and substantiallyaltered ``dwelling units'' be readily accessible to and usable by individualswith handicaps. In addition, 24 CFR 8.23(b) requires that, to the maximumextent feasible, alterations to ``dwelling units'' be made readily accessibleto, and usable by, individuals with handicaps. Since shelters may or maynot be regarded as ``dwelling units'', the second sentence of andSection;576.79(a)(2) states that, for purposes of the ESG program, the term ``dwellingunits'' in 24 CFR Part 8 includes sleeping accommodations. In addition,grantees (or the State recipient) under 24 CFR 8.6(d) must adopt and implementprocedures to make available to interested persons information concerningthe existence and location of services and facilities which are accessibleto individuals with handicaps.Environmental Requirements and Site SelectionSection 576.51(b)(2)(vi) of this final rule requires that HUD conduct anenvironmental review of the specific project activities proposed by anapplicant before the grantee can be authorized to undertake these activities.On the basis of an application from a State or formula grantee, HUD willmake a conditional grant. The ``condition'', while assuring the availabilityof funds to applicants, requires applicants to provide HUD with specificinformation on the nature and location of proposed activities. This informationwill assist HUD in conducting its environmental review, so that the Departmentcan evaluate the effect of the grantee's proposed activities and to, thereafter,authorize the grantee to proceed with its proposed activities.This requirement reflects the Department's determination that proposedprogram activities are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act(NEPA). The proposed ESG rule contemplated that the NEPA exemption providedby the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) for the ESG program underthe Homeless Housing Act of 1986 would be continued. This exemption wasapproved by the CEQ on the basis of statutory conflict, since the 1986Act imposed time limitations that precluded compliance with NEPA. HUD hasdetermined that the restrictions imposed by the 1986 Homeless Housing Acton the ESG program no longer pertain. In the absence of statutory conflict,NEPA and CEQ's implementing regulations apply, and it is HUD's responsibilityto conduct the required review in accordance with 24 CFR Part 50. The HUDreview may rely on NEPA provisions for `'categorical exclusions'', althoughHUD must complete an ``environmental assessment'' for proposed activitiesthat are not totally excluded, or otherwise present environmental siteproblems.While this change in the environmental procedures for the Emergency ShelterGrant Program would appear to have the effect of delaying the provisionof assistance, HUD does not expect that result will occur. The $8 millionappropriated for FY 1988 for Emergency Shelter Grants has already beenawarded and therefore will not be delayed by these procedures. EmergencyShelter Grants for FY 1989 are expected to be governed by revised environmentalprocedures included in both the pending House and Senate amendments tothe McKinney Act. These amendments call for responsibility for environmentalreviews to be delegated to the grantee, as provided in the Community DevelopmentBlock Grant program. Such a delegation of responsibility would permit granteesto undertake most Emergency Shelter Grant program activities without delay.Second, with respect to NEPA and program objectives, andSection; 576.53(c)(2)provides that HUD will not approve funds for any program whose activitieswould result in significant impact on the human environment. Such approvalwould constitute a ``major Federal action'' and require HUD to preparean environmental impact statement (EIS). HUD has determined that the lengthof time required to prepare an EIS would run counter to the objective oftimely delivery of ESG Program services and activities. Where significantimpact would result, HUD expects the applicant to select different activitiesor a different location that HUD may determine not to have such an impact.This assures the State or formula grantee of its fund allocation whileassuring the environmental quality of its program.Third, with respect to environmental authorities other than NEPA, HUD hasdetermined that its environmental review must take into account all therelated authorities cited at 24 CFR 50.4. This has led to the followingchanges in this final rule:1. The final rule does not contain the provisions for an environmentalassurance by applicants that was contained in the proposed ESG rule atandSection; 576.51(b)(3)(i).2. Under the environmental assurance, applicants certified to HUD thatthey would avoid sites with certain environmental problems (specifically,historic properties and floodplains) and that activities would not be inconsistentwith the State's Coastal Zone Management Plan (where applicable). HUD hasdetermined that the listed environmental resources included only the mostcommon resources, but did not list all the resources and authorities citedin 24 CFR 50.4. Accordingly, the final rule contemplates that, in conductingits environmental review, HUD will take account of all the authoritiescited under this provision.3. The final rule deletes andSection; 576.79(k) of the proposed rule, ``Conformancewith HUD environmental standards.'' These standards, issued under 24 CFRPart 51, are included in the authorities of 24 CFR 50.4 and so automaticallyare covered in HUD's environmental review. Separate listing as an ``otherrequirement'' therefore is unnecessary.These changes are predicated upon the Department's determination that environmentalreview, both under NEPA and the related authorities of Part 50.4, is aresponsibility best retained under direct HUD control, and that these reviewsshould not be delegated to ESG grantees. Similarly, an asurance by an ESGapplicant that it will avoid impact on certain environmental resourcescalls for a determination that HUD, not the applicant, should make underthe applicable environmental regulations. Thus, the determination as towhether proposed activities will have a significant impact on the environmentis a HUD determination, and the necessary changes are made in this finalrule.Fourth, HUD has deleted from the final rule the provisions that were containedin the proposed rule at andSection; 576.53(f). The provision allowed HUDto authorize formula grantees and State recipients to incur costs at theirown risk prior to HUD's approval of the grant. HUD has determined thatsuch a provision would violate legal requirements for prior environmentalreview, and that preapproved activities and expenditures would limit theconsideration of alternatives and entail the possibility of irreversibleimpacts on the environment even if HUD, after environmental review, decidednot to approve the activities or their location.Fifth, as part of this rule-making, HUD is amending for immediate effectits environmental regulations, 24 CFR Part 50 and 58. These changes simplyadd to the previous list of NEPA-related categorically excluded activities.The new exclusions reflect certain activities under the ESG program andother homeless assistance programs which HUD believes lack potential effecton the human environment. Specifically, these activities consist of suchservices as health, substance abuse and counseling services, the provisionof meals and payment of rent, utility and maintenance costs, and similaractivities that do not involve physical change to buildings or sites.The amendment to Part 58 recognizes that many communities also invest theirCommunity Development Block Grant funds in shelter activity. As the useof CDBG funds is subject to environmental review by the community underPart 58, this amendment will assure consistency with Part 50 while enablingcommunities to undertake and utilize Part 58 environmental reviews forthe CDBG program which HUD may also accept for purposes of the ESG program.This is particularly advantageous to local planning efforts, and implicitlyrecognizes that under Part 50 HUD may accept a prior adequate environmentalreview undertaken in another program.DisplacementAn ESG grantee or State or nonprofit recipient is prohibited from expendinggrant funds for any activities that would result in the displacement ofpersons or businesses. The requirements of the Uniform Relocation Act (asproposed to be revised) will govern any unanticipated or unavoidable displacementoccurring after initial approval of the ESG application.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Matters</ITAG>A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR Part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42U.S.C. 4332. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for publicinspection during regular business hours in the Office of the General Counsel,Rules Docket Clerk, at the above address.This rule would not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of the Executive Order on Federal Regulations issued bythe President on February 17, 1981. Analysis of the rule indicates thatit would not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 millionor more; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.In accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Undersigned herebycertifies that this rule would not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities, because most statutorily eligiblegrantees and State recipients are relatively larger cities, urban counties,or States. In addition, the grant amounts to be made available to any ultimateuser of a grant are relatively small.The information collection requirements contained in this rule have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions ofthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3502), and assignedOMB control number 2506-0089.This rule was listed as item number 999 in the Department's SemiannualAgenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1988 (53 FR 13854, 13858)under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number for the EmergencyShelter Grants Program is CFDA No. 14.231.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG> 24 CFR Part 50Environmental assessments, Environmental impact statements, Environmentalpolicies and review procedures.24 CFR Part 58Environmental assessments, Environmental impact statements, Community DevelopmentBlock Grant Program, Environmental policies and review procedures.24 CFR Part 575Grant programs_Housing and community development, Emergency shelter grants,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.24 CFR Part 576Grant programs_Housing and community development, Emergency shelter grants,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Accordingly, the Department amends 24 CFR Part 50 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 50_PROTECTION AND ENHANCEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY </ITAG>1.

For example, grant amounts may not be usedfor: (i) Acquisition or construction of an emergency shelter for the homeless;(ii) The costs of staff involved in operating the shelter; or (iii) Rehabilitation services performed by the staff of a grantee or recipient,such as preparation of work specifications, loan processing, or inspections.(2) Grant amounts may not be used to renovate, rehabilitate, or convertbuildings owned by primary religious organizations or entities, unlessthe following conditions are met: (i) The building (or portion thereof) that is to be improved with the grantamounts has been leased to an existing or newly established, wholly secularentity (which may be an entity established by the religious organization);(ii) The HUD assistance is provided to the lessee (and not the lessor)to make the improvements; (iii) The leased premises will be used exclusively for secular purposes,and will be available to all persons regardless of religion; (iv) The lease payments do not exceed the fair market rent for the premises,as they were before the improvements are made; (v) The portion of the cost of any improvements that also serve a non-leasedpart of the building will be allocated to, and paid for by, the lessor;and (vi) The lessor enters into a binding agreement that, unless the lessee,or a qualified successor lessee, retains the use of the leased premisesfor a wholly secular purpose for at least the useful life of the improvements,the lessor will pay to the lessee an amount equal to the residual valueof the improvements. (vii) The lessee must remit the amount referred to in paragraph (c)(2)(vi)of this section to the original grantee from which the amounts used torenovate, rehabilitate, or convert the building under this paragraph (c)(2)were derived: <T3>e.g.,</T3> if the amounts used under this paragraph initially weremade available to a State or to a unit of general local government as aformula allocation (andSection;576.43) or a reallocation (Subpart F), theamount that the lessor provides to the lessee must be remitted to the Stateor unit of general local government, as appropriate. While the originalgrantee is expected to use this amount to alleviate homelessness in theoriginal grantee's jurisdiction, there is no requirement that funds receivedafter the close of the grant period be used in accordance with the requirementsof this part. If, however, a private nonprofit organization is the lesseeas well as the grantee, the organization must remit the amount referredto in paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section to HUD. (viii) The lessee may also enter into a management contract authorizingthe lessor religious organization to operate the facility, including theprovision of essential services, in carrying out the secular purpose.
