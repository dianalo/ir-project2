Stubs represent the small share of equity that remains in a company hollowed out by debt. Most of these companies' assets are dwarfed by their liabilities, giving them negative net worth; in all of them, debt far outweighs shareholders' equity.    Yet their shares have exploded even beyond the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 Index. Though stubs once were widely avoided, &quot;Everyone is buying them now,&quot; says Robert Raiff, co-head of research at C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell. The negative bias, he says, has flipped, replaced by a &quot;perverse opposite {and favorable} bias&quot; that has propelled stub shares to full valuation or overvaluation.    MIM Ltd., a big British money manager, has created a publicly traded fund to invest in stubs, which started trading in London last week, and it has scooped up stubs such as Owens-Corning Fiberglas, FMC and Shoney's. The closed-end fund, known as &quot;Leveraged Opportunity Trust,&quot; was &quot;hugely oversubscribed,&quot; according to Christopher Mills, its investment director.    Salomon Brothers, catching the trend, has introduced an index of 20 stub securities. As the index plainly shows, when stocks do well, stubs do very well. (Guess what may happen when the market falters.) Salomon's data suggests that stub price movement is magnified in down markets as well.    &quot;They are extremely volatile,&quot; Mr. Mills says of stubs. Some are downright &quot;dangerous,&quot; he says. &quot;But when you get it right, you get a much higher rate of return.&quot;    Many stubs are created from buy-outs. Shareholders in RJR Nabisco got a lot of cash and a small stub, convertible into equity, in the post-acquisition RJR. Others are spawned from self-imposed recapitalizations. Companies such as gypsum marketer USG, hotel operator Holiday and publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich have fended off raiders by borrowing to pay big dividends. Either way, the stubs stand behind a long line of bondholders if a company is dissolved; only after debt is satisfied can stubholders stake a claim to assets or earnings.    They were once looked upon as corporate zombies. The value was thought to have been all squeezed out. But more than a few, such as Owens-Corning Fiberglas, have slashed their debt and returned to the living.    Many others, such as USG, remain hard-pressed. The company is struggling under $282 million of yearly interest expense -- &quot;$850,000 a day,&quot; as its helpful spokesman says -- and a weak market for housing.    Others, such as Harcourt Brace, are dependent on selling assets to pay off debt. Harcourt has said it plans to sell its theme parks. This amounts to an admission that its earlier strategy of expanding themepark revenue has failed, analysts say. A Harcourt official didn't return telephone calls seeking comment. But bulls are hoping that Harcourt might get a fancy price. Its shares have surged 75% in the past two months.    &quot;Stubs trade in a crazy manner,&quot; Elliot Eisenberg, a broker at R.D. Smith, says. &quot;You don't need a real business. You only need a perception of one.&quot;    Robert Salomon Jr., director of research at Salomon, is bullish, though he says stubs must be judged individually. He calls the Salomon index &quot;a proxy for the health and well-being of LBOs. Most of the stubs we follow, such as RJR and Quantum Chemical, we like.&quot;    Grant's Interest Rate Observer has been publishing a narrower stub index, which served as a model for Salomon's. Its editor, James Grant, says his index is &quot;way off the charts,&quot; outpacing the Sandamp;P by more than the Salomon index. But he reads the index as &quot;a barometer of speculation,&quot; not of the market's health. &quot;Stubs are the equity at the bottom of a pile that is precariously stacked&quot; with debt, he says.    R.D. Smith's Mr. Eisenberg likes Triad Systems, which operates computer terminals for finding auto parts -- indispensable, he says, if you need a right front fender for a '76 Chevy. He disdains so-called asset sale stories. These, he says, amount to buying beanbags and trying to sell the beans.    The lure of stubs is that the potential gain is unlimited. Junk-bond buyers, by contrast, merely get their money back, along with a handsome rate of interest.    Speculation is hottest in stub companies that have pared their debts. Buyers think such companies are ripe for another recapitalization, and for taking on more debt. Call it restubbing.    Holiday fended off the New York developer Donald Trump with a $65-a-share dividend in 1987, and has since reduced debt by nearly $1 billion. Its shares have surged 158% this year on hopes that its managers will decide to sell the company. C.J. Lawrence analyst James Murren calls it &quot;a creeping LBO.&quot;    Mr. Murren liked the stock at 40, based on his asset valuation of 65 a share. Now, with the stock at 69 3/4, Mr. Murren has raised his asset valuation to 110 -- allowing him to stay bullish. &quot;But it's reached a point where you can no longer justify it on either earnings or cash flow,&quot; Mr. Murren says. &quot;Something -- a transaction -- better happen.&quot; Marvin Roffman, an analyst at Janney Montgomery and a bear on Holiday, counters that stubs such as Holiday trade &quot;in a market of perceptions.&quot;    Even some bulls seem to be hearing warning bells. Though Salomon's Brian Doyle is recommending RJR's equity stub, he concedes it is &quot;a judgment call. You have to believe they will do extensive asset sales, and you have to sign on that they will accelerate growth rates.&quot; And Mr. Salomon, in a report on stubs, says, &quot;The run-up in stub prices prior to the crash suggests that this segment bears watching as a barometer of sentiment . . . . Stubs are a meaningful measure of speculative excess for the market as a whole.&quot;    ---   Granville says sell: After 22 months as &quot;a bleeping bull,&quot; newsletter writer Joseph Granville has issued an all-out sell signal.    &quot;This is the call to liquidate stocks,&quot; he said in a message to &quot;early warning&quot; clients this week. &quot;It is clear now that most stocks have seen their highs . . . . Gold stocks can be held, but everything else is suspect.&quot;    Mr. Granville says it will &quot;be very difficult to avoid an out-and-out stock massacre this October&quot; similar to the big October decline in 1978 or the crash in 1987. His main concern: The number of stocks hitting new highs has drastically declined this month, as it did in August 1978 and August 1987.    On Monday, Mr. Granville says, only 54 stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange made new highs, down from 306 on Aug. 1. That 82% shrinkage in new highs is comparable to the 85% shrinkages in 1978 and 1987, he says, adding, &quot;The market has never -- and 'never' is a powerful word -- recovered from percentages of shrinkage exceeding 80%.&quot;    Mr. Granville, who had a mighty influence on the markets in the 1970s and early 1980s, lost most of his following a few years ago because of bad market calls. Lately, he has been trying to make a comeback. From last fall to now, he correctly stayed bullish when many other advisers were pessimistic.    --John R. Dorfman </TEXT></DOC>
