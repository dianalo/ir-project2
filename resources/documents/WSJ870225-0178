More than any other post-World War II president, Mr. Reagan has scaled back the growth of centralized government by cutting social spending, transferring federal-government programs to state and local authorities, sharply reducing income taxes and deregulating key sectors of the economy. These policies have helped bring about the second-longest U.S. peacetime economic expansion in the past 40 years, accompanied by the creation of more than 12 million net new jobs in the past four years. Internationally, the American experiment has inspired a global return to free-market principles as an antidote to the increasingly obvious economic failures of socialism.    Having just concluded an assignment as U.S. ambassador to the European Community, I am impressed by the resurgence in Europe of individual initiative after two decades of steady growth of big government. Now, even socialist governments are espousing such formerly heretical ideas as privatization, deregulation, lower tax rates and expanded share ownership. The United Kingdom and France have been especially active in putting policies into effect.    The Thatcher administration since 1979 has privatized 13 major companies and has plans to transfer another four before the end of the current Parliament. More than $11 billion in state assets have been returned to the private sector, along with 400,000 jobs. More than four million individual investors signed up last month to buy stock in British Gas in the most ambitious privatization plan attempted so far in the U.K. In France, the Chirac administration kicked off its privatization program by successfully offering 28 million shares in the Saint-Gobain glass conglomerate to the public. The sale brought the French treasury $1.3 billion. Over the next five years, the French government hopes to denationalize 65 companies for $33 billion to $50 billion.    No fewer than 11 industrial nations are planning to sell all or part of their interests in state-owned concerns in 1987. In the U.S., where public-sector ownership has traditionally played a small role in the economy, the Reagan administration has received congressional approval to sell Conrail, the federally owned rail system. This sale is expected to raise up to $2 billion in the current fiscal year. The president also seeks congressional approval to sell the U.S. naval petroleum reserves, worth $2.2 billion, regional power stations valued at $14.4 billion, and $5 billion in federal loans.    The privatization programs in the U.K. and France, by spreading capital ownership among a broad segment of the population, have started to transform attitudes about capitalism. Share ownership is no longer being seen as something only for the rich, but rather an investment option for citizens of all classes, including employees of the privatized companies. The new shareholders become personally committed to the success of their country's industries. Old distinctions between workers and employers break down.    The sale of public assets in Britain have more than doubled the number of U.K. shareholders, to more than six million. Of this number, more than 430,000 are employees of the privatized concerns -- an impressive 87% of the total employees of those firms. The Saint-Gobain privatization in France increased the total number of French shareholders by 20% to 1.8 million from 1.5 million. The French government reserved 2.8 million shares of Saint-Gobain stock for company employees and has set a goal of 10% employee ownership in future share offerings. A total of three million Frenchmen applied for shares in the Paribas investment bank in the second privatization conducted by the Chirac administration. Before nationalization in 1982, the bank had only 150,000 shareholders.    Early signs in the U.K. show that privatization and expanded ownership have produced more efficient and profitable enterprises. British Telecom, for instance, has eliminated the long waiting lists for telephone installation that were commonplace before privatization. Its share price has quadrupled since it was offered in 1984. The National Freight Consortium's pre-tax profits were up to 70% for 1985 and up six times since its denationalization in 1982. Cable andamp; Wireless has registered pre-tax profits up fourfold since its 1981 privatization. Amersham International's pre-tax profit has doubled since it went to the private sector in 1982. Jaguar came from near bankruptcy and extinction to lead the country's automobile exports since its privatization in 1984. British Aerospace has tripled its pre-tax profits since privatization in 1981. I believe we will see similar results in France in the coming years.    The Thatcher administration also struck an early blow for individual initiative in 1979 when it reduced its top personal tax rate from 83% to 60%. However, if I have one criticism of British policy, it is my disagreement with Tory reluctance to follow up with further reduction of the top rate to spur investment and help cut Britain's chronic 13% unemployment. The current 60% rate -- imposed on individuals earning more than $61,500 -- is still a disincentive for risk taking and productivity. By Jan. 1, 1988, Britain's lowest rate of 29% will be higher than the top U.S. rate of 28%.    The new U.S. rates will be the lowest in the industrialized world. Britain and other countries are rightfully concerned that, unless their taxes are lowered considerably, they will face accelerated &quot;brain drain&quot; of top scientists, engineers and job-creating risk takers who are badly needed at home. Fully appreciative of this new &quot;American challenge,&quot; France has lowered its top rate to 58% from 65% with a further cut to 50% projected before 1990. The Italian government has approved a reduction in its top rate to 56% from 62%. Japan will introduce this year its most sweeping tax reform since World War II, and Canada is also preparing a serious tax-reduction package.    Tax cuts on high marginal rates, according to a growing body of empirical evidence, are among the simplest and most effective means of bringing back money sunk in the underground economy, unproductive tax shelters, or deposits outside the country. Author George Gilder, for instance, studied the 1979 British tax cuts and found that revenue after the cuts increased despite a recession. The top 5% of U.K. taxpayers now contribute 26.7% of all income-tax revenue, against 24% before the cuts.    What we are witnessing today across the globe is a reawakening that &quot;We the People&quot; are more effective in managing economic affairs than unwieldy bureaucracies. The current phase of slow-but-steady economic growth must ineluctably yield, at some point, to recession. Those with short vision will blame the system and look to government to effect structural changes, as was done in the 1930s. That is why it is imperative that the broadest possible group be brought into the incentive system in this moment of relative prosperity.    ---   Mr. Middendorf just returned to Washington after a tour as U.S. ambassador to the European Community. </TEXT></DOC>
