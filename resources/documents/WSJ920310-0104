Investigativejournalists and their editors, however, still had to contendwith a watchful official censor, who would cut out anythingthat smacked of criticism of the socialist system. Thesolution hit on by Arkady Vaksberg, a trained lawyer and oneof the best Soviet investigative reporters, was to writeabout individual cases of bribery, influence-peddling and thelike as if they were the exception rather than the rule.   &quot;What the authorities feared most of all was generalizedcomment, but they did not interfere with separate . . .one-off cases of law-breaking by people in officialpositions,&quot; Mr. Vaksberg recalls in his revealing but flawedbook, &quot;The Soviet Mafia&quot; (St. Martin's Press, 285 pages,$24.95). Working for Literaturnaya Gazeta, the weekly paperof the Russian intelligentsia, he soon made a name forhimself by uncovering official skulduggery, sometimesprefacing his articles with a note explaining that theextortion or thievery being described was &quot;an atypicaloccurrence.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Constraints on the press have gone the same way as theSoviet Union itself, and Mr. Vaksberg has now decided to pourout the contents of his notebooks, disclosing a lot moreabout the everyday abuses of power in the former Soviet Unionthan he could ever write in his newspaper.   &quot;The Soviet Mafia&quot; is a catalog of the seedy, fawning andcorrupt elite that ran the superpower into the ground, pavingthe way for its ultimate collapse. We are shown in detail howlocal Communist Party bosses in southern Russia, Uzbekistan,Kazakhstan and elsewhere grew fat and happy by defrauding thesystem they were supposed to be governing, and then coveringtheir tracks with threats and bribes.   Some of the anecdotes are well-known in the former SovietUnion and also have been reported in the West. The Uzbekleadership's blatant manipulation of its cotton harvestfigures -- deliberately inflated so it could pocket the extramoney from Moscow central planners -- became a cause celebreduring the early Gorbachev years and led to a complete purgeof the republic's leadership.   Other tidbits are new and hilarious, worthy of Gogol. Mr.Vaksberg describes how the leader of Azerbaijan took LeonidBrezhnev on a fishing expedition and paid divers to hang fishon the old man's hook in order to ensure that he had a goodday. My favorite is the story of the KGB major stationed inBeirut who didn't have time to spy because he had to dealwith inane requests from his secret-service bosses in Moscow,including sending them tins of olive oil and arranging forvisiting dignitaries to attend striptease shows. The SovietEmbassy financed these expenditures by selling off all itsofficial cars and telling Moscow that they had been destroyedin fighting between Christian and Muslim militias.   Sadly, Mr. Vaksberg doesn't make best use of the rich,sometimes astonishing, material he has collected over theyears. Most of the anecdotes speak for themselves. But theauthor, perhaps because he never was able to generalize inhis newspaper articles, now goes too far the other way,trying to force the details into a broad and spurious thesis.Soviet corruption was so rampant, he claims, that the economyand the entire political system were mere pawns in the handsof shadowy mafia groups.   He labors the point so hard that &quot;The Soviet Mafia&quot; endsup reading like a collection of turgid and repetitiveeditorials. Yet he doesn't back up his argument withincontrovertible evidence, or even clarify who these shadowygroups really are. At times, he uses the term &quot;mafia&quot; in theWestern sense, to describe organized gangs of criminals, thesort of people who fix fruit prices in farmer's marketsaround the nation, run extortion rackets or steal Western aidparcels and then resell them. More often, though, he uses theterm loosely. &quot;The whole political regime of the country inall its guises for the last seventy years is itself a mafia;a despotic totalitarian regime cannot be otherwise,&quot; hewrites.   There are two problems with this. The first is thatreducing Stalin to the role of Don Corleone merelytrivializes the atrocities of the Gulag, in which millions ofpeople died. It's a bit like calling Hitler a hoodlum.Secondly, if the Soviet Union had just been a playground forgangsters, how is it that two men who set out to fightcorruption, Yuri Andropov and Mikhail Gorbachev, ever rose tobecome the nation's leaders? Mr. Vaksberg argues weakly thatit was just one mafia faction against another in the battlefor power. But, as he makes clear himself when he writesabout his best sources, there were many law-enforcement andcourt officials who refused to succumb to political orfinancial pressure.   Mr. Vaksberg's book is thus not &quot;a shocking expose oforganized crime in the U.S.S.R.,&quot; as its subtitle would haveus believe. Rather, it is a sad illustration of how a richand proud nation can be plundered and ruined by a few men andtheir cronies abusing an unchecked monopoly on power. TheSoviet Union insisted that it was morally superior tocapitalist countries. But, as Mr. Vaksberg makes clear, inthe dying days of the Soviet Union, kickbacks were the realcurrency, and toadying the required etiquette of power.   ---   Mr. Gumbel, the Journal's Moscow bureau chief for nearlyfour years, is now Paris bureau chief.</TEXT></DOC>
