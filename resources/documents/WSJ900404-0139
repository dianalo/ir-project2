Flying in the face of that trend, a leadingwine marketer is launching a new ad campaign that unabashedlyaims to recruit young drinkers.   Banfi Vintners, marketers of Riunite wine, hopes thecampaign will be just the shot in the arm that the saggingRiunite brand needs to boost its sales.</LP><TEXT>   William Roethel, Banfi's vice president of marketing,candidly describes the ad campaign as an effort to &quot;win overentry-level drinkers.&quot; The campaign, which includes radiocommercials that feature young men and women flirting atparties, is scheduled to begin airing nationwide next month.   Not surprisingly, the idea of targeting young drinkersdoesn't sit well with critics of the liquor industry. &quot;I'mshocked they would choose this particular time to launch sucha campaign, given the growing public concern about youngpeople and alcohol,&quot; says Patricia Taylor, director of thealcohol policies project at the Center for Science in thePublic Interest, a lobbying group in Washington, D.C.   Both liquor and cigarette makers are increasingly underattack for allegedly targeting young people in theiradvertising. Recently, New York City's consumer affairscommissioner, Mark Green, accused RJR Nabisco of trying tolure young smokers to its Camel brand with an ad campaignfeaturing a cartoon character called Joe Camel. RJR hasdenied the charge. Beer companies also have been criticizedfor doing special promotions aimed at college students.   The criticism is part of a growing attack on targetedmarketing of all types by liquor and tobacco companies. Inrecent months, cigarette makers also have come under fire forads aimed at blacks and at women.   Mr. Roethel insists that Banfi isn't proposing to woounderaged drinkers to the Riunite camp. &quot;That is absolutelynot part of what we're doing,&quot; he says. &quot;We're not doinganything that we aren't proud of.&quot;   The Banfi executive says the company decided to go afteryounger drinkers in part because of the difficulty ofchanging Riunite's low-brow image among older consumers. Itmade more sense, according to Mr. Roethel, to work oninstilling a freshened image for the brand among youngerdrinkers.   &quot;We're a very palatable entry-level type wine,&quot; he says,referring to Riunite's sweet taste. &quot;Someone who's alreadycultivated a wine palate, Riunite isn't going to appeal tothem.&quot;   Riunite badly needs a marketing makeover. Although it isstill the top-selling import, sales have been on a downwardspiral since 1984, when they hit a peak of just over 11million cases. Last year alone, volume dropped more than onemillion cases to 4.9 million cases.   For the new campaign, Banfi is reviving its old slogan:&quot;Riunite on Ice. That's Nice.&quot; Since the slogan was droppedfive years ago, Banfi has struggled with a number ofcampaigns, including failed attempts to reposition Riunite asa premium-style brand. &quot;That strategy was a little bitill-conceived,&quot; Mr. Roethel now says.   The new radio campaign, developed by Ketchum Advertising,New York, marks a departure for Banfi, which hastraditionally used television to advertise Riunite. One radiospot plays on the sometimes crude approaches taken by peoplewhen they introduce themselves to members of the opposite sexat parties. &quot;I'm in construction and my feelings for you arebuilding,&quot; a guy says to a woman. &quot;I don't date men who wearmore jewelry than I do,&quot; the woman says to her friends,recounting the meeting.   Mr. Roethel believes the campaign will be a big success.He says it was tested in eight cities last year, promptingrespectable sales increases. But some wine experts areskeptical that younger drinkers will be a big, new market forRiunite. &quot;This is by no means new. Who else {but youngpeople} ever drank it?&quot; says Paul Gillette, editor andpublisher of Wine Investor, a trade newsletter. &quot;This wasnever something that was consumed by refugees from ChateauLafite.&quot;   ---   Young andamp; Rubicam Award                                                                                                          Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. awarded its spottelevision buying account to Young andamp; Rubicam, following anextended review which also included incumbent J. WalterThompson and BBDO, a unit of Omnicom Group.   Industry executives estimate billings at $30 million to$32 million. However, since the account, like other moviestudio accounts, doesn't involve creative work, it isn't aslucrative as a typical account of that size. Young andamp; Rubicamwill buy local TV time and New York newspaper space.   Young andamp; Rubicam declined to comment, as did Thompson, aunit of WPP Group. Gene Cameron, who heads BBDO's Los Angelesand San Francisco offices, said: &quot;We've got the capabilitythat can be very valuable in the movie business. We're goingto do it somewhere.&quot;   The account had been larger at Thompson, where it alsoincluded network media buying. But Fox recently began buyingnetwork time itself, prompting the review, said Bob Harper,Fox's president of marketing. Thompson had handled theaccount for 10 years. Young andamp; Rubicam will take over startingwith Fox's summer lineup, which begins with an Andrew DiceClay comedy thriller called &quot;Ford Fairlane.&quot;   ---   Ad Notes. . . .                                                                                                          KENT CIGARETTES: Lorillard, New York, named Avrett, Free andamp;Ginsberg, New York, to handle its $8 million to $10 millionKent cigarette account. The decision follows a creativeshootout lasting several months in which Lorillard, a unit ofLoews Corp., conducted extensive tests with consumers on thefinalists' work. Also pitching the account were GreyAdvertising and Saatchi andamp; Saatchi Advertising, a unit ofSaatchi andamp; Saatchi Co. The account had been handled by BBDO.                                                                                                          ADWEEK: A/S/M Communications, parent of Adweek magazine,closed down two additional titles, Media Week and ImagingRetail News, because of the poor ad environment, said KennethFadner, president.
