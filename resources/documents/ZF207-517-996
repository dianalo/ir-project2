(HP), Siemens Corp. and ATandamp;T plan to boost the emergingFDDI standard for fiber-optic networks this week by banding together toannounce development of compatible fiber-optic transceivers.andM;The agreement among the three firms is designed to eliminate proprietarydesigns that have plagued the growing market for fiber-optic LANs byproducing products from each company that are &quot;pin-for-pin&quot; compatible,officials from the companies said.andM;By complying with the emerging Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)standard, the products will bring the speed, versatility and network securityof 100M-bps fiber-optic cables directly to users' machines via transceiverdevices that are interchangeable, the officials said.andM;The lack of compatible products &quot;has slowed the general acceptance of FDDItechnology among users and has made vendor changes or new [FDDI-based]networks costly and time-consuming,&quot; said Rick Kniss, general manager of HP'sOptical Communication Division in Palo Alto, Calif.andM;The final FDDI specification is expected to be approved as a standard byyear's end.andM;Under the agreement, each firm will release its own product; however, thethree firms plan to release the general specifications to third-partyvendors, officials said.andM;&quot;OEMs will now have reliable sources of standard products at an acceptableprice,&quot; said Franz Fuchs, director of Siemens' Fiber OpticDivision/Electromechanical Components in Santa Clara, Calif.andM;Given the industry standings of HP, Siemens and ATandamp;T, most industry observersbelieve systems designers and components manufacturers will now come tomarket with FDDI-based products more quickly than they would have otherwise.andM;&quot;This agreement significantly enhances the trend toward acceptance of theemerging FDDI LAN standard,&quot; said John Kessler, president of KMI Corp., anindustry consulting group in Newport, R.I.andP;  &quot;[It] further confirms industryprojections for rapid growth of FDDI in the early 1990s.&quot;andM;HP, ATandamp;T and Siemens are expected to have sample versions of their productsout by the fall.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
