Acidic and basic dissolution were observed in all saltsexcept Li/sub 2/CO/sub 3/, which underwent only basic dissolution. Theslopes of the solubility lines in both acid and basic regime were relatedto the dissolution products where possible. The dependence of NiO solubilityon the activity of O/sub 2/ in the system was determined for both regimesof all the melts.</TEXT></DOC>
