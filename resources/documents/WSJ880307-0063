Mr. De Benedetti is seeking to buy an additional 2.1 million shares of Generale de Belgique, or about 7% of the company's stock outstanding, for 8,000 Belgian francs ($225.80) each. The bid, which had been scheduled to end last Friday, so far has attracted about 300,000 shares, Cerus said.    Belgium's Banking Commission extended the bid but made the extension conditional on Mr. De Benedetti's revealing the identity of his allies, which hold slightly more than half the Generale de Belgique shares he claims to control. Including the shares purchased recently under the bid, Mr. De Benedetti says he controls about 48% of Generale de Belgique's extended share capital.    A rival Franco-Belgian group led by the French holding company Cie. Financiere de Suez claims to control a majority of Generale de Belgique's shares outstanding, but Mr. De Benedetti hopes to sway some members of that alliance with his bid. Separately, Cie. Industriali Riunte, Mr. De Benedetti's industrial holding company, today will propose a merger with the financial holding company Sabaudia Finanziaria S.p.A, in which it has a 63% stake, a CIR spokesman said. The proposal is part of a plan by Mr. De Benedetti to focus more on industrial activity and less on purely financial investments, sources close to CIR said. </TEXT></DOC>
