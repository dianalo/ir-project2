Yang (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FORGN </CO><IN> MON </IN><G> CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate agreed to a provision that would give certain large investors who want to start a business in the U.S. preference in immigration -- a plan that critics assert would put U.S. citizenship up for sale.    Lawmakers voted 51-33 to uphold a measure that would reserve 4,800 conditional visas each year for immigrants who invest at least $2 million in a business that creates jobs for 10 or more U.S. citizens or legal residents. Shortly afterward, senators reduced the amount to $1 million in a voice vote.    If the investment continues to provide that employment for two years, the investor would become a permanent resident alien and could become a citizen in another five years. Otherwise, the investor would face deportation.    Similar arrangements are in effect in Canada and Australia.    The provision is part of legislation that would revise immigration laws by giving the federal government more flexibility in admitting legal immigrants. The bill would allow 590,000 immigrant visas annually in the first three years after enactment, or 100,000 more than under current law.    The Senate is expected to approve the entire bill, sponsored by Sens. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) and Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.). Similar legislation is pending in the House.    Sen. Dale Bumpers (D., Ark.) tried to strike the investment provision from the bill, arguing that it would allow the rich to buy U.S. citizenships. &quot;This is a simple case of saying, 'You can bribe us . . . and become a citizen of this country,'&quot; he said during debate. &quot;It's immoral; it violates our national character.&quot;    Mr. Bumpers warned that the clause could be used by foreign drug dealers or other criminals who want to flee their homes and establish residency in the U.S.    Sen. Simpson defended the proviso as a means of encouraging investment. &quot;It will create jobs for the less fortunate in our society,&quot; he said. &quot;It won't allow wealthy individuals to buy their way past the Statue of Liberty.&quot;    Drafters of the bill said their intent was that an investor's visa be revoked if it was learned that the investment money was gained illegally.    Under international treaties, about 30,000 foreign investors now hold nonimmigrant visas, which don't lead to citizenship, according to Sen. Simpson. These people have invested a minimum of $150,000 each in the U.S. and employ at least one U.S. resident.    In addition, current law allows individuals who invest a minimum of $50,000 and hire at least four U.S. residents to receive immigrant visas, according to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.    However, those visas are issued only if other annual immigration quotas aren't filled. Because of the heavy demand for immigration to the U.S., visas haven't been issued under that program since the early 1970s and applications for them aren't being accepted, according to the immigration service.    ---   Andy Pasztor contributed to this report. </TEXT></DOC>
