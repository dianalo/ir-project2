The 95-4 vote approving the fiscal 1990 defense authorization bill puts the Senate squarely behind development of the most expensive weapons sought by the White House, including the B-2 Stealth bomber, a proposed space-based anti-missile shield, and a pair of mobile, land-based nuclear missile systems. &quot;The basic goals of the president were met,&quot; said Virginia Sen. John Warner, the bill's Republican floor manager.    But the Senate's spending blueprint, hammered out during more than a week of frequently emotional debate, differs markedly from the House version of the bill, which sharply cuts spending on the Bush administration's top strategic priorities. House and Senate conferees are expected to face lengthy and difficult negotiations next month to resolve the disparities.    Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) said there are &quot;more profound differences&quot; between the House and Senate bills this year than at any time in recent memory. &quot;We'll be interested in hearing {the} logic&quot; behind the House positions, he told reporters after the vote. &quot;It doesn't leap out at you.&quot;    Rushing to dispose of a host of amendments and finish the bill before Congress's scheduled August recess begins at the end of the week, senators yesterday easily rejected efforts to restrict development and testing of anti-satellite weapons. The administration strongly opposes such restrictions.    But in a series of votes that kept lawmakers on the floor well past midnight Tuesday and into the night yesterday, the Senate approved substantial changes to other parts of the Bush defense package. Generally, the Senate bill beefs up production of a wide range of conventional weapons that weren't sought by the White House.    The bill, for example, substantially increases funding for various missiles, conventional ammunition, and infantry and anti-tank weapons in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. And yesterday, without much debate or even a formal vote, senators approved non-binding language supporting continued work on the V-22. The estimated $25 billion program to produce tilt-rotor transports for the Marine Corps was slated for elimination by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.    The Senate Armed Services Committee previously authorized only research money to continue development of the V-22, built by units of Boeing Co. and Textron Inc. But the supportive language adopted by the Senate greatly increases the chances that the final version of the bill will follow the House's lead and provide money to begin actual production of the troop transports, which are designed to take off like a helicopter but cruise like a plane.    The Senate bill differs from the House version in several other important ways.    Overall, the House authorized $2.5 billion less than the Senate for the B-2, land-based mobile missiles, and the proposed space-based anti-missile system known as the Strategic Defense Initiative.    The House slashed SDI funding to $3.1 billion from the nearly $4.9 billion requested by the White House, in order to free up money for anti-drug and anti-pollution programs. The Senate, on the other hand, repeatedly refused to cut SDI funding below the $4.5 billion recommended by the Armed Services Committee.    The Senate measure backs Pentagon plans to deploy a new generation of jet fighters, Army helicopters and Air Force transport planes by the late 1990s. It authorizes a $2.7 billion down payment on these programs, which are likely to require substantially more than $100 billion if the Pentagon proceeds with full-scale production. But it deleted funding for continued production of Grumman Corp.'s F-14 jet fighter.    In addition to such big-ticket weapon systems, the Senate's massive authorization bill covers everything from enhanced pay for military pilots and scientists to increased purchases of commercial, &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; items by each of the services.    Other highlights of the Senate bill include:    --Some $450 million to step up the Pentagon's role in fighting narcotics smuggling. Overall, the bill earmarks $1.7 billion of unobligated funds from Defense Department accounts and an array of domestic programs to pay for anti-drug legislation that Congress approved last year but still hasn't funded fully.    --Language urging the Central Intelligence Agency to step up efforts to locate American hostages in the Middle East. The amendment, among other things, requires the CIA and the Pentagon to report to Congress by Sept. 1, 1990, explaining whether additional money and agents will help find and win the release of the hostages.    Arguing that the CIA relies on a &quot;totally insufficient&quot; cadre of covert operatives in the Middle East, Sen. Arlen Specter (R., Pa.), the main sponsor of the amendment, urged the administration &quot;to do whatever it takes&quot; to free the hostages.    --&quot;Burden-sharing&quot; amendments designed to prod Japan, South Korea and U.S. allies in Western Europe to increase their defense spending. While the amendments aren't binding and merely express lawmakers' desires to reduce U.S. military spending overseas, they demonstrate growing Senate impatience with some allies.    By a voice vote, senators urged Mr. Bush to consider the &quot;feasibility and desirability of partial, gradual reductions in U.S. military personnel&quot; in South Korea. The bill also calls for negotiations aimed at getting Japan to pay billions of additional dollars to cover the cost of keeping U.S. forces in that region. </TEXT></DOC>
