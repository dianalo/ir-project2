Relating to Rule for Linkage With a ForeignSecurities Exchange </ITAG>On March 6, 1989, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'')submitted for Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') considerationpursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),\1\<NOTE/> and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\<NOTE/> a proposed rule change that would adopt a ``Linkage Rule''that would enable the BSE to link with a foreign securities exchange pursuantto a ``Linkage Plan''.\3\<NOTE/> The Exchange has stated that the proposed rule would be applicableto any linkage agreement the BSE may ultimately enter into with a foreignsecurities exchange. The BSE is currently linked with the Montreal StockExchange (``ME'') and the proposed rule would provide the framework withinwhich the link could be enhanced.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4 (1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Notice of the proposed BSE rule change was given in SecuritiesExchange Act Release No. 26698, April 5, 1989, 54 FR 14897. No commentswere received by the Commission on the proposed rule change. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The BSE-ME linkage was approved by the Commission in twophases. The initial phase of the linkage permitted ME members to directto the BSE marketable limit orders in approximately 40 U.S.-listed Canadiannational stocks available for trading on the Intermarket Trading System(``ITS''). <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21449, November 1, 198449 FR 44575. Phase two of the linkage permitted the BSE to expand the listof securities eligible to be traded on the link to include most ITS securitiestraded on the BSE. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21925, April 8, 1985,50 FR 14480. Under the proposed BSE rule, a separate Linkage Plan would provide thespecific details of the terms and conditions for the operation of a proposedlinkage between the BSE and a foreign securities exchange. The LinkagePlan would set forth criteria relating to, among other things, the typesof orders that may be transmitted through each linkage, clearance and settlement,and compliance with the provisions of the Linkage Plan and with the Exchangerules. Such a Linkage Plan would have to be submitted to, and approvedby, the Commission as a separate proposed rule change before the specificlinkage could be effected.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See </T3>letter from Howard Kramer, Assistant Director, Division ofMarket Regulation, to Joseph Carmichael, Vice President, BSE, dated March27, 1989; and letter from Joseph Carmichael, Vice President, BSE, to HowardKramer, Assistant Director, dated June 2, 1989. The proposed BSE Linkage Rule is a generic rule that would be applicableto any linkage agreement the BSE may ultimately enter into with a foreignsecurities exchange.\6\<NOTE/> The Exchange anticipates that the proposed rule would beused as the basis for drafting a proposed plan for enhancing the currentBSE-ME link to permit the northbound routing of orders from the BSE tothe ME over BEACON, the BSE's automated order routing and execution system.\7\<NOTE/> The current BSE-ME link, which does not have access to BEACON,permits market and marketable limit orders to be routed southbound fromthe ME to the BSE.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ BSE has characterized the proposed rule as an ``enablingrule.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The term ``BEACON'' is an acronym for Boston ExchangeAutomated Communications Order-routing Network. The BSE noted in its proposedrule change that the Linkage Rule will have an impact on the applicationof its rules relating to the operation of BEACON. The BSE's BEACON rulestates that ``BEACON * * * is available to foreign exchanges with whicha trading link has been established * * *'' In its order approving a BEACONpilot, the Cmmission, in footnote 4, noted the existence of the link betweenthe BSE and the ME and the fact that the BSE, at that time, had no plansto make BEACON available for transactions over the linkage. (<T3>See</T3> Release No. 34-26029 (August 25, 1988), 53 FR 27584). TheCommission stated, however:<ITAG tagnum="28">``Should the BSE * * * decide that it wants to make access to BEACONavailable over the Montreal linkage, a proposed rule change would haveto be submitted to the Commission * * *''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Under the Linkage Rule, the BSE will be able to propose that BSE beallowed to route order flow between the BSE and ME via BEACON. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ <T3>See </T3>note 4, <T3>supra</T3>.The BSE believes that the proposed rule will enhance the national marketsystem by increasing the ability of Boston specialists to attract orderflow and thereby make more competitive and more liquid markets in securitiesin which they are registered. The Commission has closely reviewed the provisions of the proposed BSErule change and finds that the proposed rule change is consistent withthe requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicableto a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with sections 6(b)(5)and 11A(a)(1)(D) of the Act.\9\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that the proposal to establish aLinkage Rule may enhance the national market system by increasing the abilityof BSE specialists to attract order flow, thereby resulting in more competitiveand more liquid markets in the securities in which they are registered.The Commission believes that investors and the public may benefit, as aresult, from improved executions of their transactions in securities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) and 78k-1 (1982).The Commission generally views agreements between U.S. and foreign securitiesexchanges as positive developments in the increasing internationalizationof the world's securities markets. Such linkages serve to facilitate theflow of capital and financial services across borders. The BSE's proposedrule change is consistent with this view. Before approving these tradinglinks, however, the Commission must be satisfied that adequate safeguardsand procedures have been established and implemented to protect investorsand detect fraudulent or manipulative acts or practices. To this end, anyspecific linkage plan proposed under the BSE rules would have to be approvedby the Commission. <T3>It is therefore ordered, </T3>pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,that the proposed rule change be, and hereby is, approved. <ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority.\1\\0\<NOTE/> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12) (1988).<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 31, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
