A party. A high-density autographing session. Eight interviews in four days. No, it wasn't too much. It's never too much. &quot;I wallow in attention,&quot; she said, sparkling. &quot;We egomaniacs are perfectly happy talking about ourselves. We could go on for days.&quot;    Folk music's icon of the '60s, the American La Pasionaria of nonviolent causes of the past few decades is a radiant and mellow 46. It's hard to think of another enduring entertainer who would so casually display an addiction to audiences, not to mention a disdain for ritual modesty. Although she is famously a sufferer of pre-performance anxieties, Miss Baez faces the immediate future without a twinge of terror.    &quot;You know why? Because I feel that I wrote a good book. I feel as though it's even written moderately well. Nobody taught me how to write. But nobody taught me how to sing either. And it's also a little bit about the way I feel about the record -- that I've made a magnificent album. And if nobody in the world buys it, it's their fault.&quot; This is followed by a full-throated laugh.    It hasn't always been that way. For most of her life, Miss Baez has labored under the weight of a powerful puritanism, in some part a heritage from her father, the physicist, born a Mexican Catholic. There were guilts about fame and possessions and worldly pleasures, all now, she says, under incomplete control. She actually had forgotten how disturbing acclaim could be until, in the course of researching the book, she asked folk singer Bob Gibson for his memories. He reminded her about the night he was working a club and invited her onstage to sing &quot;Jordan River.&quot;    &quot;He said, 'You were wailing away and having a wonderful time and the audience was singing and stomping and drinking and smoking. All of a sudden you put the guitar down and ran offstage.' He found me huddled in a corner saying, 'I can't do that. I can't do that.' It was wicked to have that much fun.&quot;    It was Mr. Gibson who brought Miss Baez to the first Newport Folk Festival in 1959 from which she emerged an instant sensation, a dark, long-haired, barefoot 19-year-old girl from the Harvard Square coffee shops who sang like an angel. The press immediately labeled her &quot;Madonna,&quot; an image she has been doing her best to jettison.    The gorgeous soprano has darkened and deepened to a mezzo and has been nurtured in recent years by formal voice lessons. In American pop culture, her kind of music has been swept out of the mainstream by successive waves of rock. The latest record, &quot;Recently,&quot; has two new Baez songs, a couple of gospel pieces, Peter Gabriel's &quot;Biko&quot; and an old Dire Straits number &quot;Brothers in Arms,&quot; and is her first in this country in eight years. In the interval, Baez records were made and sold on the other side of the Atlantic to fans with more staying power.    This winter, Miss Baez did a brief tour of Germany and found the reception &quot;sort of astounding.&quot; The audiences were three times larger than any attracted by sporadic stateside concerts, she says, and they were younger than American gatherings. Contemplating this phenomenon, she reflects, &quot;In Europe, roots are deeper, the appreciation of culture is deeper and also there are the political undertones and overtones. I still represent something they're interested in.&quot;    Years ago Miss Baez turned out a small book entitled &quot;Daybreak,&quot; but the new memoir is a fuller work. It took three years, and she wrote it herself on the word processor in the big kitchen in a house nestled among woods and mountains near Menlo Park, Calif. The other regular occupant is her son, Gabriel, 17, child of a brief union with David Harris, the anti-war activist. Her memories of the marriage are tender, but she says in her book that she never has been tempted to repeat the experience.    Sardonically funny about her attachment to her status as an important entertainer, Miss Baez writes of spending many fruitless hours with her psychiatrist &quot;trying to change myself from being Queenie to being wife.&quot; Inevitably, the book is laced with accounts of her political activities: She was involved with the Southern civil-rights movement, was tear-gassed in Argentina, endured U.S. bombings in Hanoi and, later, infuriated the American left by championing the boat people fleeing the Vietnam victors. Assessing her political concerns, still a major preoccupation, she pauses midchapter to note ironically, &quot;Someone had to save the world.&quot;    The memoir has an odd ramshackle structure and its author has an irritating habit of never bothering to mention the last names of some friends and lovers. What sustains and brightens it is a compelling bluntness and candor. There is a chapter on a humiliating 1984 European tour with Bob Dylan in which he emerges as the ultimate spoiled show-business monster. There is a chapter on the single lesbian relationship of her youth, an episode to which she once owned up to an interviewer because she cannot tell a lie and that has dogged her ever since.    She prefers men -- among the preferred have been, publicly, the young Dylan and, more discreetly, the young Kris Kristofferson -- and she has a touchingly adolescent attraction to really beautiful men. Stricken with admiration at the first sight of Don Johnson at the Live Aid concert two years ago, she greeted the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; star with &quot;Hello, Gorgeous. Could we discuss the possibility of rape?&quot; Most of all these days, Miss Baez is partial to &quot;soft skin and peach fuzz&quot;; the loneliness of a tour, she tells us, is apt to be eased by the company of a handsome, congenial young rookie.    It's hard to know whether Miss Baez set out to demolish lingering remnants of the madonna image with her book, but she says she won't be sorry to see it go. &quot;That madonna stuff is not useful,&quot; she says. &quot;People either think that I'm a prude or they think I really am a wonderful person. Nobody is that wonderful.&quot;    Miss Baez's appearance at Live Aid -- she opened the daylong concert with a memorable six minutes -- rekindled a public interest that has waxed and waned over the years. Even in the absence of such events, however, she has never imagined her audience vanishing altogether. In that context, she recalls Jann Wenner, publisher of Rolling Stone, trying to explain why he had tabled a planned Baez cover with, &quot;You're timeless, but you're not timely.&quot;    &quot;It's awful, but true,&quot; Miss Baez said. &quot;It's untrue at the moment because of the book and the album. But there are certain kinds of stardom in which you will always have some audience even if it's only because you're a legend. They'll always be there. What you hope for is that they will broaden and it's not just going to be the hippie blue hairs who follow you till you're dead.    &quot;The ideal thing is the Grateful Dead, whose audiences now average anywhere from 12 to 70, from accountants in their 50s to my son who started going to their shows when he was 15. That refreshes you and gives you new perspective. But no, the answer quite immodestly is the time really won't come when there'll be no audience at all. My voice will give out sooner than that.&quot;    ---   Ms. Dudar is a New York free-lance writer. </TEXT></DOC>
