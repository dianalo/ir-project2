This guy was amusic teacher and he used to sing counterpoint to all the hymns.And I thought, `What's going on here, 'cause he's singing the wrongtune yet it's all working.'   ``I used to always try to get near this guy. I'm sure he must bedead by now, but he was an incredible guy. He wrote this wholeopera for little kids, based on the `Barber of Seville.' He playedfiddle, amd come to think of it, I starred in one of his shows.''   Love of music has sustained this rock 'n' roll journeyman, asurvivor from England's long forgotten ``pub-rock'' movement of themid-1970s whose soulful vocals periodically have appeared on hitrecords: ``How Long'' by Ace, Squeeze's ``Tempted,'' Mike and theMechanics' ``Silent Running'' and his own Top 10 single, ``Don'tShed a Tear.''   In between, the singer admits, have been gray areas, times spent``between hits'' when Carrack appeared more destined to wind up ina ``Whatever Happened To'' book rather than Billboard's Hot 100.   ``I've had some ups and downs, indeed. Some troughs, suffice tosay. But during the troughs I was still hanging in there. I'venever really done anything else apart from this.''   Set Carrack's career to music and it might sound like this: afast start, very fast. Maybe too fast. Soon, the tempo breaks down,the needle skips over parts of the record and scratches appear. Butjust when the song appears over, the pace picks up and steadilybuilds.   That's where he is now, nearly 20 years in the music businessand finally making records with his name on it, his keyboards andhis choice of style.   ``It's a bit raggedy and I like that. I didn't play a note onthe previous album. Chris (Difford of Squeeze) is the kind of guywho likes everything in place. You know, precise. I'm not precise.T-Bone (producer T-Bone Wolk) loves the way I play. it's slightlydodgy, but that's fine. You know what I'm saying?''   The 12 songs on ``Groove Approved'' combine rock, pop, soul,gospel and country. Because Carrack prefers to write with others,such associates as Wolk, longtime friend and fellow pub-rockalumnus Nick Lowe and Squeeze member Chris Difford all pitch in.   ``Love Can Break Your Heart'' was co-written by ex-DoobieBrother Michael McDonald, whose partnership with Carrack came afterseveral unsuccessful ``blind dates.''   ``I was in L.A. and my record company (Chrysalis) was pitchingme songs and pitching me songs and saying, `We think you should gettogether with other writers.' I had only written with people likeNick (Lowe) so they set up a bunch of meetings for me to meet theold LA tunesmiths.   ``I'm not knocking these guys, some of them had goodreputations, but it was very, very weird. This one guy, bald asbrass, was sitting by the swimming pool in his hotel, and he's gota ghetto blaster. He puts on the old backing track and gives me awhole performance by the swimming pool.''   To Carrack's astonishment, and the record company's (Anchor) aswell, the first single, ``How Long,'' was a worldwide smash. AnAmerican tour was inevitable _ and disastrous. Gold was alreadyfading to gray.   ``We did all the wrong things,'' he said. ``We came over andopened for Yes on a tour of enormous arenas for three months. Thatwas very much the wrong thing to do. We were a very low-key band.We should have done some clubs.   ``We had three years of a gradual winding down and demise andwent back to England. But the scene had changed drastically. We gotback for the punk era and we didn't fit in at all. So that was veryweird. The songs I was writing were just out of time.''   He waited it out, playing in local bands and making valuablefriends _ like Lowe and Difford. By the early '80s, punk had burnedout and pop and soul were welcome again.   The hits with Squeeze and Mike and the Mechanics gave Carrackenough commercial power to build up his solo career, starting twoyears ago with ``One Good Reason,'' and now ``Groove Approved.''   ``To most people I'm a new artist. For myself as a musician, Istill feel I'm only just scraping the tip of the iceberg in a lotof ways. Maybe I'm just a slow learner.   ``I'm 38. I've been drifting around, doing this and that.Thirty-eight, when most people are finished in this game and I'monly getting to make what feels like my first bloody record. It'sweird, eh?''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PM Mon Dec. 4</NOTE></DOC>
