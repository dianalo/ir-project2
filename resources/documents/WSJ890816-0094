Palmer Jr. and Linda Coffee were ordered acquitted of federal charges that they concealed a false statement in a bankruptcy-law case.    The unusual order by Judge A. Joe Fish directed the jury to find the two lawyers innocent without deliberating. The ruling marked the end of an equally unusual criminal case.    Mr. Palmer, 59 years old, and Ms. Coffee, 46, were indicted in April. Many lawyers in Dallas contended that the allegations against the two were more appropriate for possible disciplinary action rather than criminal prosecution. Several bankruptcy lawyers contributed to a defense fund on behalf of Mr. Palmer, one of the most veteran bankruptcy-law practitioners in Dallas.    Assistant U.S. Attorney Jack C. Williamson, who represented the government in the weeklong trial, couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Palmer was represented by Abbe David Lowell of Washington, D.C., and Ms. Coffee was represented by Dallas lawyers William Ravkind and Kim Wade. </TEXT></DOC>
