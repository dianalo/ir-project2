Furthermore, sludge shouldbe converted into compost to prevent odors or breeding of harmful insects.A technique is developed for complete sterilization of sludge and rapidproduction of compost. Sludge is first sterilized by electron beams andcomposting is performed under optimum conditions including the fermentationtemperature. Typically, about 10/sup 8/ - 10/sup 9/ bacteria are containedin 1 g of sludge, with coliforms accounting for about 10 percent of thetotal bacteria. Irradiation of 15 kGy can reduce the total number ofbacteria by 6 - 7 orders of magnitude. Irradiation of 2 kGy can almostcompletely exterminate coliforms, which are highly sensitive to radiations.This indicates that 0.2-second irradiation is sufficient if a dose rateof 10 kGy/sec is used. After the sterilization process, sludge is compostedunder the following conditions: temperature of 40 - 50 deg C, initialpH of 7 - 8 and particle size of 5 mm or less. Compared with conventionalprocesses, the maximum fermentation rate is greater by 10 times and canbe reached 10 times more rapidly. Conventional processes require morethan 10 days while the present technique takes only 2 - 3 days untilcarbon dioxide stops generating. (Nogami, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
