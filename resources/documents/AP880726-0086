The party position, outlined in the newspaper Pravda, reflectedan unusually harsh line against those pressing for Armenian controlof Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian enclave in neighboringAzerbaijan.   Coming after a hardline speech by Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev in which he rejected ethnically motivated claims, itseemed designed to show pro-annexation activists they could nolonger count on high-level support. Armenia's parliament voted inJune to annex Nagorno-Karabakh.   Azerbaijani authorities opposed the change, and the Kremlin lastweek deemed annexation ``impossible.''   Pravda reported that party leaders in Armenia met Monday todiscuss ``the instigatoray character of speeches at meetings'' heldin Yerevan, the Armenian capital.   The Armenian leaders ``condemned the extremist, instigatory,politically harmful speeches and urged ... all the ideologicalagencies to launch effective efforts to expose the anti-peoplecharacter ... of the activists,'' Pravda reported.   Armenians account for about three-quarters of Nagorno-Karabakh's162,000 residents, and they have complained of mistreatment by thegovernment of Azerbaijan, which is predominantly Moslem. MostArmenians are Christians.   Labor unrest that brought Nagorno-Karabakh to a virtualstandstill for two months began subsiding Monday, when Tass said 78percent of the region's workers showed up at their jobs.   Both the state-run media and activists in Stepanakert,Nagorno-Karabakh's central city, reported Monday that the strikeswere over and business was proceeding at a normal pace.   Some have vowed to continue the fight for annexation, butcentral authorities have made it clear that a tougher stance willbe taken by police in future demonstrations or work stoppages.   Activists in Yerevan called last week for a five-day strike toprotest the July 18 decision by the Presidium of the SupremeSoviet, but most residents ignored the proposal.</TEXT></DOC>
