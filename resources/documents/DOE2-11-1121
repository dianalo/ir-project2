The followingstages of hydrogeologic investigations are analyzed: borehole drilling(investigating position of aquifers, water influx rates, stratification,physical rock properties such as porosity), geophysical investigationsof coal bearing strata (electrical logging, radiometric surveys aimedat determining water flow in underground water systems), laboratory investigationsof water and rock samples (determining physical and mechanical rock propertiesthat influence mine draining and water hazards in an underground coalmine, determining chemical composition of mine water), hydrogeologicinvestigations carried out at the ground surface (aimed at determiningground water level and forecasting hazards associated with ground subsidenceafter coal seam extraction and mine draining).</TEXT></DOC>
