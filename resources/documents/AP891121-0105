The provision bars the use of U.S. aid money to entice foreigngovernments to carry out policies banned by American law. It grewout of the Iran-Contra affair, in which aid to Honduras wasexpedited in return for Honduras' agreement to shelter theNicaraguan Contras at a time when Congress had banned U.S. militaryassistance to the rebels.   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., in a statement on the House floor, saidtoday that the provision refers only to clear written or oralagreements with other governments and ``is not an attempt tohamstring government officials in the course of their normalduties.''   The administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,said Bush now was being advised to approve the measure.   In another area of controversy within the bill, Congressrejected attempts to restrict U.S. military aid to El Salvador, butthere were signs that a week of heightened violence has leftlawmakers wary of continuing what one called a ``blank-check''policy.   ``After 10 years of bankrolling failure, it is time we changedour policy,'' said Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore. ``Have we no right toask why after almost $4 billion spent, after 70,000 lives lost, whyour policy has not produced different results?''   Both the House and the Senate on Monday voted down efforts tocurb the $85 million in U.S. military aid due to flow to thegovernment of President Alfredo Cristiani in the coming year,heeding a call by President Bush not to further weaken thatcountry's new administration.   After a debate that rekindled old animosities over El Salvador,the House voted 215 to 194 to effectively keep the restrictionsfrom being added to the foreign aid bill, which contains money forU.S. allies around the globe and the first cash in a new aidprogram for Poland and Hungary.   It sent the bill to the Senate, which rejected a similaramendment by a 58-39 margin and forwarded the measure to Bush forhis signature.   Bush earlier in the day had termed any attempt to cut off aid tothe Cristiani government ``absolutely unacceptable,'' and added:``This is not the time to undermine a fragile democracy that isunder attack ... It's totally unacceptable, and the day of theseMarxist attacks should end right now.''   But the past week's violence in El Salvador appeared to havecreated a shift of roughly 20 votes in the Senate since the bodyvoted 82-18 Sept. 20 for military aid with no conditions.   And the House followed its rejection of strings on the militaryaid with nearly unanimous approval of a resolution warning thatfuture aid would hinge on whether Cristiani tracks down and puts ontrial those responsible for the murder last week of six Jesuitpriests and two apparent witnesses to the killings. The vote was409-3.   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said lawmakers were coming underheavy pressure from Christian groups to take action against ElSalvador, including heavy lobbying and demonstrations at somemembers' district offices.   In Washington, the National Conference of Catholic Bishopsexpressed support for proposals ``to withhold substantial portionsof military aid while the performance of the Salvadoran governmentand military is tested.''   And opponents of U.S. aid heckled Bush during an appearance inChicago, while others in Washington repeatedly interrupted Senatefloor proceedings and were forcibly ejected from the chamber byCapitol police.   In El Salvador, a pitched weeklong battle that has cost morethan 1,000 lives was winding down as the leftist rebels of theFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front withdrew from the capitalof San Salvador into the countryside.   In the House, Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., had proposed to addlanguage that would have held back 30 percent of this fiscal year'smilitary money until after April 1 of next year to keep pressure onthe Salvadoran government to solve the Jesuit murders.   A similar proposal in the Senate, pushed by Sen. Patrick Leahy,D-Vt., would have withheld 30 percent of the military aid until thekillers of the priests were apprehended and brought to trial.   But Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., called it ``a terrible amendment,''and added: ``If we pass it, we reward the communist terrorists ...and punish the democratically elected government.''   ``To rush into this breech with this kind of amendment issuicide, gentlemen, for that country,'' argued Rep. Gerald Solomon,R-N.Y. ``This amendment is a selective response to a greattragedy.''   ``This is not a debate over who are the good guys and who arethe bad guys,'' countered Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., ``This is adebate over whether the United States has an obligation to assurethat taxpayer dollars are going to a government that protects humanrights.''   Bush said he had personally told Cristiani ``how strongly wefeel about the killings.''   ``And I told him that they must get to the bottom of it. I amconvinced they will. The people who did this, whether they comefrom the extreme left or the extreme right, pay the penalty,'' Bushsaid.   Major aid items included in the bill were $3 billion for Israel,$2.1 billion for Egypt, $500 million for Turkey, $300 million forGreece, $440 million for the four Central American democracies,$533 million for Poland and Hungary, $125 million for the drug warin Bolivia, Peru and Colombia and $160 million for a newinternational development initiative for the Philippines.</TEXT></DOC>
