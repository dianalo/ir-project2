Because we intended to introduce DT fuelsinto the device, the items of research and development works are quitedifferent to that of non-burning machines. Aluminium alloy developmentsto avoid activations by 14 MeV neutron irradiations, tritium safe handlingand vacuum system with tritium are examples of this category. Besidespecific requirement directly caused by DT introduction, highly reliableoperation of the machine is strongly requested, because it is the necessarycondition to perform experiments safely. However, these efforts are stillin an early stage of investigation and many efforts are needed to preparea rigid data base tokamak operation with reacting plasma.</TEXT></DOC>
