The amountof nickel (predicted value) is calculated and commented in regard tothe limitation value of nickel fixed at 24 mg/kg Ni - obtained from thereproducibilities of the round robin test by XRF and AAS standard methods.The limitation values as well as the dependent predicted values shouldonly be fixed after the precision of these values had been examined inround robin tests, and if their accuracies are tested by other methodsindependent from the applied standard methods.</TEXT></DOC>
