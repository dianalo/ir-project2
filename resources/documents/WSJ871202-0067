YangStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Congress took a rest yesterday from such weighty matters as the federal budget deficit to grapple with another national issue: designating a national march.    By a voice vote, the House gave the honor to John Philip Sousa's &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever,&quot; a tune one supporter modestly called &quot;the greatest march ever written.&quot; The Senate approved the measure last month and President Reagan is expected to sign it into law.    Approval of a march hasn't come without some of the usual congressional footdragging. Americans collected a national anthem (&quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;), a national motto (&quot;In God We Trust&quot;), a national bird (the bald eagle) and, just last year, a national flower (the rose), before deciding which tune to march to.    Lawmakers have made numerous attempts over the past half-century to drum up support for &quot;The Stars and Stripes,&quot; which Mr. Sousa composed in 1896 while aboard a ship sailing to America from England. An earlier legislative effort in the House failed when lawmakers attached to it an amendment changing the national anthem to &quot;America, the Beautiful.&quot;    Lately the cause has been championed by a retired music-store owner from Tulsa, Okla., a self-styled &quot;Sousa enthusiast&quot; who claims to so closely resemble the &quot;March King&quot; that John Philip Sousa III, the composer's grandson, sometimes has trouble distinguishing photos of the two men.    James Saied, 72 years old, orchestrated support from a number of organizations representing sellers of musical instruments, music teachers and band leaders, as well as from Sen. David Boren (D., Okla.), who praises &quot;The Stars and Stripes&quot; as capturing &quot;the energy, exuberance and drive of the American spirit.&quot;    Others have fallen into formation. During yesterday's brief debate, Rep. Constance Morella (R., Md.) trumpeted the composition as the &quot;most identifiable American march not only in America but around the world,&quot; recalling that it was played by the Chinese when President Nixon first arrived in Beijing.    But there are always some who prefer marching to a different drummer, or at least to another Sousa tune. House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said some of his friends believe lawmakers should have honored the composer's &quot;The Washington Post March&quot; instead. But, he said, &quot;We'll go with 'The Stars and Stripes Forever' for now.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
