LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mayor Carl E. Officer said Fridaythat his cash-strapped city has come up with the money for itsbiweekly payroll, but that workers still won't get paid on timebecause of a City Hall squabble.   City Treasurer Charlotte Moore, whose elective job includesauthority to sign city payroll checks, posted a brief note Fridayafternoon advising city workers that they would not receive theirchecks until Monday. Friday was payday.   On Thursday, she had said that city coffers were about $70,000short of meeting the $230,000 payroll. But Officer charged that thecity had the money on Friday and said Mrs. Moore was withholdingthe money deliberately.   ``This is a case of protest by the city treasurer because ofrecent layoffs in her office,'' Officer said in a telephoneinterview.   Twenty-five of the approximately 275 city workers were laid offMonday _ including all of Mrs. Moore's regular staff _ and the cityexpects to cut another 25 in the next week or two, ComptrollerLaMar Gentry said.   Mrs. Moore did not return numerous telephone calls to her officeFriday.   Officer said he also had tried unsuccessfully to reach her.   ``She's the most wanted person in town right now,'' Officersaid, adding he had heard many complaints from city workers.   The withholding of the paychecks ``doesn't make any sense,especially when you have over a half a million dollars in cash inthe bank.''   Officer said Friday that the money had been transferred fromother accounts _ mostly revenues collected for the city by thestate or county _ in plenty of time to cover the paychecks.   Gentry agreed with the mayor's charge that the payroll shortagewas trumped up by Mrs. Moore because of the layoffs.   ``There is no problem with the payroll, only in the treasurer'seyes,'' he said.   East St. Louis has been on a financial roller coaster fordecades. Sixty-one percent of the city's 55,000 residents receivesome kind of public assistance and about 40 percent of its citizensare unemployed.   Officials say the depressed city's financial problems show nosign of subsiding.   On May 17 _ two days after its next payroll is due _ the citymust make a $54,000 payment on a court judgment it owes a GraniteCity man, Walter DeBow. DeBow was seriously injured in a 1985beating at the city jail. Attorneys for his family last monthobtained a temporary freeze of the city's assets to force paymentof the settlement, which totals about $4 million.   But Gentry said he expects the city to be able to cover itsupcoming payrolls and the payments on the DeBow judgment byshuffling funds around in the ``day-by-day, week-by-week process''of trying to keep the city afloat.   ``I've been doing it (the comptroller's job) since '84 and wehaven't missed one (payroll), but we've had to do some jugglingacts,'' he said.   Gentry also said the city was in no greater danger of bankruptcyFriday than it was four years earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
