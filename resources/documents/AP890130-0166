Sponsors of the legislation said it will be the first of its kindin the nation.   ``The purpose of this legislation is not just to make gunmanufacturers pay, to the limited extent that money can compensate,for the suffering that their products cause,'' said Council ChairmanDavid Clarke, the bill's original sponsor. ``This legislation isdesigned to force gun manufacturers to consider carefully thepurposes for which handguns are manufactured.''   The plan would hold handgun manufacturers, importers and dealersliable for damage caused by handguns, in the same manner some stateshold tavern owners or party hosts liable for injuries caused bydrunken drivers.   The bill is supported by 12 of the 13 council members in a citywhose officials are worried about a rising murder rate.   January is already the bloodiest month in city history, with 49killings through Monday. That grim trend was established in 1988when 372 persons were killed in the nation's capital, the highestyearly total ever.   Police blame up to 60 percent of the killings on drug-relatedviolence.   Clarke said he expects stiff opposition from the National RifleAssociation, but he predicted that the NRA and other pro-gun groupswill try to block the measure in the House of Representatives, whichreviews about legislation from the council.   ``This is a very stupid idea, another in a series of attempts bythe D.C. Council to divert attention from the city's abysmal recordin fighting crime,'' said NRA Assistant General Counsel RichardGardiner. ``It's very clear that their intent...is to outlaw privatehandgun ownership.''   Gardiner promised to fight the matter before the city council,and said it is likely his organization will continue its battle inCongress.   The district already has a complete ban on handgun purchases, andprohibits registration of any weapon not purchased before 1976.</TEXT></DOC>
