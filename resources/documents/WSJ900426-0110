Shareholders and other investors have filed so many suitsagainst him, seeking billions of dollars, that even a fortuneas big as Mr. Milken's may be vulnerable, the attorneys say.</LP><TEXT>   Attorneys for Mr. Milken dismiss the suggestion as absurdand say Mr. Milken's potential liability won't be nearly soextensive. While some shareholder attorneys routinely filemultimillion-dollar suits whenever a takeover is announced orthe market drops, the suits against Mr. Milken seem to bemuch more likely to succeed than most.   Consider:   -- Mr. Milken's guilty plea to six felony counts Tuesdaymakes it impossible for him to claim in civil cases that hewas guilty of no market fraud. In each case, the former junkbond impresario will be viewed as a convicted felon.   -- So much evidence against him has already been gatheredby federal prosecutors and the Securities and ExchangeCommission, much of which will eventually become available toshareholder lawyers, that plaintiffs' attorneys will have todo relatively little sleuthing of their own.   -- While Mr. Milken didn't plead guilty to anyracketeering counts, recent court cases have made itincreasingly easy to show a so-called pattern of racketeeringin civil cases. Shareholders have sued Mr. Milken under theRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, and RICOdamages are automatically tripled.   -- The SEC's funds to compensate victims of marketwrongdoing by Mr. Milken, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. andconvicted abritrager Ivan F. Boesky, while stocked with morethan $600 million, cannot be used to pay tripled damages orpunitive damages. Thus, any judgment against Mr. Milken abovemere compensatory damages would have to come out of his ownpocket. Drexel was Mr. Milken's former employer. Thesecurities firm has filed for bankruptcy-court protection.   All of this sounds like good news to Richard Greenfield,one of the nation's top shareholder lawyers. As he eagerlyscanned the early wire reports of the plea Tuesday, Mr.Greenfield said Mr. Milken should seriously contemplatefiling for bankruptcy-court protection. &quot;It's a very realpossibility,&quot; said Mr. Greenfield, who has filed severalcases against Mr. Milken. &quot;If I were in his shoes, I'd wantto start over on Day One. By the time he's out of jail, it'sall over.&quot;   Steven Rosenfeld, an attorney for Mr. Milken, says thereare &quot;no plans whatsoever&quot; for his client to seekbankruptcy-court protection. The partner in the New York lawfirm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind Wharton andamp; Garrison says there is&quot;nothing particularly remarkable&quot; about the allegations inthe lawsuits. &quot;There is a word processor somewhere that spewsout the same . . . allegations,&quot; Mr. Rosenfeld says. &quot;I viewthat as a plaintiff tactic.&quot;   As his partner Arthur Liman said the day before, Mr.Rosenfeld said the Milken camp believes the $400 million Mr.Milken is required to provide the SEC for civil restitutionwill more than cover any legitimate claims.   Still, the Milken team faces a morass of suits. One of themost sweeping, filed last month in Los Angeles byshareholders of Unocal Corp., accuses Mr. Milken, Drexel andmany major takeover artists of the 1980s of a massiveconspiracy that defrauded shareholders in takeover targets.   Mr. Greenfield's firm filed the suit along with plaintifflawyer William S. Lerach of the shareholder law firm ofMilberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie and Lerach. It alleges aback-scratching arrangement by which Mr. Milken teamed upwith high-profile corporate raiders to manipulate stockprices in huge acquisitions. The suit, which seeks $2.3billion in trebled damages, claims that more than 70defendants violated the RICO law.   Under the alleged arrangement, Mr. Milken shared &quot;secretinformation with market operatives&quot; and backed the takeoverattempts of such raiders as Carl Icahn, Ronald Perelman, T.Boone Pickens and others. According to the allegations, araider would typically tell Mr. Milken he wanted to take overa particular company, and Mr. Milken would then issue junkbonds for the raider's companies and arrange for otherraiders to buy the bonds. The raiders felt obligated to buythe bonds because they wanted Mr. Milken to fund their futuretakeover attempts, the suit says. Meanwhile, at Mr. Milken'sdirection, arbitragers would purchase big blocks of stock inthe target company with guarantees against loss provided byMr. Milken, the suit claims.   While the Unocal suit claims enormous damages toshareholders, a suit filed by Mr. Greenfield's firm inFebruary may be even broader. The firm sued on behalf of atleast 10,000 class members who purchased high-yield,high-risk bonds underwritten by and sold through Drexel. Theycharged that the junk bond market was rigged, that priceswere artificially determined and that without Mr. Milken toact as &quot;puppeteer,&quot; the market fell apart. Action in thiscase is stalled for procedural reasons.   Also pending are a multitude of civil cases lodged in thepast three years against Mr. Boesky, Drexel, Mr. Milken andothers that accuse the defendants of insider trading, stockmanipulation and other securities law violations. Many ofthese cases are pending in federal court in New York, wherepretrial fact-finding has been slowed because of theunavailability of Mr. Boesky, Mr. Milken and others totestify at depositions. Thus far, federal prosecutors havegotten the judge to deny the plaintiffs' lawyers access tothese witnesses while criminal investigations are beingpursued. But at some point, such a partial stay willpresumably be lifted.   Finally, a sprinkling of cases across the country targetMr. Milken among many other defendants in cases alleging thatsavings and loans associations and other companies sufferedlosses because they purchased large portfolios of Drexel'sjunk bonds as part of back-scratching arrangements with Mr.Milken.   The strength of the plaintiffs' various charges aredifficult to gauge. Mr. Greenfield likens them to theasbestos cases that led to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy-courtfiling of Manville Corp., the giant asbestos manufacturer. Hesays he believes that once one case &quot;breaks through&quot; totrial, Mr. Milken will have no choice but to start settlingthe rest of the cases.   But a spokesman for Mr. Pickens's Mesa Petroleum Co., adefendant in the Unocal case, calls the allegations &quot;sillystuff. They've taken any name that's appeared next toBoesky's or {Boyd} Jefferies's. . . . They're throwing namesin the soup and alleging a scheme that is pure nonsense.&quot; Mr.Jefferies, a former brokerage firm chief in Los Anglespleaded guilty to two felony counts of breaking securitieslaws in April 1987.   Says attorney James Conroy, commenting on behalf of RevlonGroup Inc. Chairman Mr. Perelman and his MacAndrews andamp; ForbesHoldings Inc., &quot;The suit casts a net very broadly and names alot of people in the process. We don't belong there becausethere is no basis in fact for the allegations.&quot;   A civil case is always easier to prove than a criminalcase because the civil plaintiff doesn't have to prove hischarges beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead he must show onlythat the accusations are more likely than not to be correct.Nonetheless, the plaintiff's lawyers agree that winning atrial against Mr. Milken wouldn't be easy.   &quot;It can't be proven by a handful of witnesses and ahandful of documents,&quot; says Mr. Greenfield. Instead, thelawyers must attempt to show juries patterns of trades inwhich prices appear to be rigged and raise the issue of howthe securities were priced. The defendants, says R. BruceMcNew, a partner in Mr. Greenfield's firm, &quot;have to have aninnocent explanation for what they've done. In the process ofproving your case, you then take apart their explanation.&quot;   Alan Bromberg, a law professor at Southern MethodistUniversity, says showing a chain of bond purchases doesn'tnecessarily prove that Mr. Milken was in control of thesellers and buyers, &quot;but it does permit that inference.&quot; Theoutcome of the case will depend on whether the jury believesthere was a conspiracy or the sellers and purchasers of bondsmade independent judgments.   Mr. Bromberg and others assert that Mr. Liman, Mr.Milken's principal lawyer, negotiated to make the pleaagreement narrow enough so that little of what Mr. Milkenadmitted to can be used against him in the civil suits. &quot;Isuspect they fought hard on that, and my guess is they werepretty successful at it,&quot; Mr. Bromberg says.   However, a little-noticed provision in the plea agreementcould prove to be invaluable to civil plaintiffs. Prosecutorsextracted a promise from Mr. Milken that he wouldn't attemptto block them from including in their sentencing memo manyadditional charges of wrongdoing to which he didn't pleadguilty.   Recently Robert Freeman, former Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. headof arbitrage, successfully blocked inclusion of such broaderallegations in the government's sentencing memo. Thus, thegovernment's full case against Mr. Freeman, who had pleadedguilty to just one insider trading charge, was kept frompublic view.   In the Milken case, however, prosecutors are expected tooutline a broad scheme of alleged wrongdoing, involving awide range of companies and securities. Those charges couldbe exceedingly helpful to plainitffs lawyers building civilcases against him.   Realistically, it's highly unlikely that the civil casesagainst Mr. Milken will ever go to trial. Most shareholdercases are settled, and Mr. Greenfield says he has had onlytwo jury trials in the past six years, while handling scoresof suits.   One reason for this is that plaintiffs' lawyers typicallydon't charge hourly rates. Instead they charge their clientsfor a percentage of the settlement or jury award, generally20% to 30%. Therefore, it is often to their benefit todispose of cases as quickly as possible.   But settlements work only if both sides believe they aremaking a fair compromise, considering what the damages mightbe if the case went to trial. And, in the Milken litigation,settling so many high-stakes cases could be a long and trickyprocess in itself.   ---           Major Actions Against Milken, Others                                                                                                          CASE:   Unocal Corp.
