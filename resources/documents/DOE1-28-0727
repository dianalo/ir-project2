A sticky foil method has been developed for sampling and assessingthe amount of dust present on a non-textile surface by measuring thepercentage of light diffusely transmitted through the foil. The resultswere calibrated against % area covered as determined by microscopy. Themethod is reproducible easy to use, quick and can detect less than 0.2%coverage. A sampling strategy was formulated and used to demonstratethe effect of a weekly cleaning routine. Having such a method makes itpossible to establish a baseline in terms of measured values againstwhich any surface or cleaning program can be compared.</TEXT></DOC>
