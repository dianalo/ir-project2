(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fair weather and a new defense of sandspared South Carolina's hurricane-scarred beaches further damagefrom unusually high tides.   As the cleanup from Hurricane Hugo continued nearly a monthafter it struck, there were these other developments:   _ Officials on Isle of Palms asked a judge to postpone electionsset for Nov. 7.   _ A spokesman for the National Flood Insurance program said12,644 Hugo flood claims filed in South Carolina will represent theprogram's biggest payoff ever.   _ Schools reopened Monday for 44,000 youngsters. Pupils builthouses for displaced birds, wrote essays and talked out theirfeelings about the storm.   A high tide of 7.3 feet arrived Monday morning along beachesflattened by Hugo's 135 mph winds and 17-foot tidal surge lastmonth. Tides generally run between 5 and 6 feet along SouthCarolina's coast.   ``It was a beautiful day and the ocean was just about flat athigh tide,'' said Folly Beach Mayor Bob Linville. Forecasters hadsaid the tides could further damage the beaches only if accompaniedby storm-driven winds; winds Monday were only 7 mph under sunnyskies.   The higher-than-normal tides were caused by an alignment of theEarth, moon and sun that occurs about once a decade.   During the last two weeks, crews have been pushing up mounds ofsand along 40 miles of the hardest-hit areas of the coast.   ``The berms on the beaches performed well. They did exactly whatthey were intended to do,'' said Lt. Col. Jim Scott, an engineerwith the Army Corps of Engineers.   He said in some places the tides breached the berms, but thewater pooled harmlessly behind them.   At Folly Beach, the tide gently washed over a temporaryreplacement road to about 200 homes on the island's east end. Asthe tide receded, the road was uncovered and traffic began using itagain.   Predicted high tides were to drop to 7.2 feet today and thenrecede the rest of the week.   On Isle of Palms, Mayor Carmen R. Bunch and other officialsasked a judge to postpone the election.   ``It's unconscionable to politic on the island at this time,''said Ms. Bunch, who had not filed for re-election Monday.   But critics of her administration _ which came under fire whenit prevented residents from returning to the island while workerscleaned it up _ claim the delay would illegally extend theofficials' terms.   ``We have what is tantamount to maternal despotism over there,''said Edward Guerard, who represented mayoral candidate W.C. Waltersat a preliminary hearing Monday. ``For the city to now say that theresidents can't choose to throw them out is ludicrous.''   The National Flood Insurance spokesman, Rick Mayson, said Hugoflood claims will represent ``the biggest payoff in the history ofthe program.'' He predicted some property owners would use the cashto move their buildings back from erosion-prone beaches.   Schools reopened Monday, but in Charleston County some schoolbuildings were so badly damaged they will remain closed for months,during which classes will be held in neighboring schools.</TEXT></DOC>
