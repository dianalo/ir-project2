Before the contract vote, the company opened its financialrecords to accountants hired by the union, a move Ladd hailed as``a major breakthrough.''   The proposal, which offered three annual 2.5 percent wageincreases and the phaseout of a two-tier pay system that gives lessmoney to new employees, was rejected Saturday by a margin ofroughly 3-2, Ladd said.   However, the union's existing contract doesn't expire until Aug.14, leaving time for renewed negotiations this summer.   BIW, Maine's largest private employer, had invited its unions toopen contract talks early this year in hopes of improving itsability to compete for new shipbuilding contracts.   The shipyard lost four of five Navy cruiser contracts inFebruary to rival Ingalls Shipbuilding of Mississippi.   Duane D. Fitzgerald, BIW's executive vice president, issued astatement after the contract vote saying management officials were``disappointed with the result but believe the process wasconstructive and informative.''   ``We do not regret having made the effort,'' Fitzgerald said.   Ladd blamed the rejection in part on members' desire for biggerpay hikes and a swifter end to the two-tier wage system.   Under the current contract for Local 6, new employees have beenpaid about $3 less an hour than veteran workers. The rejectedproposal would have phased out the two-tier system in April 1990.   Local 7, representing 393 clerical and technical workers,overwhelmingly approved a new three-year contract a week ago.</TEXT></DOC>
