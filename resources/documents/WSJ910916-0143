The move was prompted by the growing impact of theweek-old stoppage on the Canadian economy. The strike hashalted Canadian grain exports and disrupted somemanufacturing, including auto production.</LP><TEXT>   The dispute is the biggest of several major work stoppagesin support of various contract demands. In Toronto, afour-day-old strike by public transit workers has shut downthe city's bus and subway system, disrupting business inCanada's largest city. Toronto claims to have the mostintensively used transit system in North America in terms oftrips per resident.   The back-to-work legislation for federal governmentworkers will provide no wage increase this year and a rise ofonly 3% next year. This is in line with the government'spolicy of spending restraint.   Parliament is expected to approve the legislation, but itspassage probably will take several days because the NewDemocratic Party, which opposes the measure, intends to useparliamentary procedural measures to delay it.   Grain farmers and manufacturers have been urging thegovernment to legislate a prompt end to the stoppage. Grainexports have been halted because grain terminal workers haverefused to cross picket lines manned by striking governmentinspectors. Manufacturing has been disrupted because autoparts and other components have been held up at U.S.-Canadaborder crossings by strike-sympathizing customs people. Manygovernment workers, including customs people, were requiredby law to work during the strike because they are classifiedas essential workers.   The government said it had no choice but to legislate areturn to work. &quot;When grain terminals are unable to move thisyear's harvest and companies are talking of impending layoffsbecause of shipping delays, the government must act,&quot; saidGilles Loiselle, the cabinet minister responsible forgovernment wage negotiations. &quot;We aren't prepared tojeopardize the recovery of the Canadian economy or essentialservices that we provide to the public.&quot;   The government's resolve on the wage issue reinforces itsanti-inflation policy. &quot;If the government were to havecapitulated, it would have sent out a very, very negativesignal,&quot; said John Clinkard, economist at the CanadianImperial Bank of Commerce. The government aims to reduceinflation, as measured by the consumer price index, to 3% bythe end of 1992, 2 1/2% by mid-1994 and 2% by the end of1995. The consumer price index in August was up 5.8% from ayear earlier, Statistics Canada, a government agency, saidFriday.   The Canadian public is putting part of the blame for thefederal workers' strike on Prime Minister Brian Mulroney'sConservative government, said Lorne Bozinoff, vice presidentof the Gallup Canada polling organization. &quot;The public is madat everybody, the government and the striking civilservants,&quot; he said. In the most recent Gallup poll, conductedbefore the latest strikes, Mr. Mulroney's government had anapproval rating of only 12%, a record low for a Canadiangovernment. By contrast, 44% of Canadians approve ofPresident Bush's performance, according to a recent Galluppoll.   The standing of Mr. Mulroney's government could receiveanother blow today when the Ontario attorney general's officeis to announce whether it will prosecute 13 prominentConservatives on corruption-related charges. Some of theConservatives are members of Mr. Mulroney's government andothers have close ties with his administration. The chargeswere filed in July by a Quebec businessman, but the Ontarioattorney general's office has taken over the case and hassaid it will handle the prosecution if it decides such actionis warranted.</TEXT></DOC>
