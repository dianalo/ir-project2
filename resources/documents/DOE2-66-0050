Acceleration of discoveries in theseareas depends principally on increased geophysical activity, exploratorydrilling, and, above all, the development of new exploratory concepts.The experience gained and the earth science and engineering data collectedover the years from mature producing basins afford earth scientists andpetroleum engineers opportunities to expand their ideas and innovativethinking in the search for new petroleum reserves in and around theseareas. There are various methods of evaluating mature basins, and ofgreat importance is the deliberate search for subtle traps in maturebasins.</TEXT></DOC>
