Two sources with detailed knowledge of the case told the Timesthat Robert T. Morris Jr., 23, a computer science graduate studentwhom friends describe as ``brilliant,'' wrote the set of computerinstructions as an experiment.   The student could not be reached for comment Friday, thenewspaper reported.   M. Stuart Lynn, vice president of Cornell's informationtechnologies, said in a statement early Saturday that the universityhad not talked to Morris but confirmed that he was a graduatestudent at Cornell.   ``We are investigating his computer files at Cornell, and so farwe have determined that his account contains files that appear tohold passwords for some computers at Cornell and Stanford to whichhe is not entitled,'' Lynn said. ``We also have discovered thatMorris' account contains a list of passwords substantially similarto those found in the virus.''   Earlier, Lynn said the university ``cannot say whether or not hewas responsible for this activity,'' adding: ``We've tried to reachhim but he's not at home. Apparently he's left for Washington. He'sapparently not in Ithaca right now.''   Several telephone calls to Morris senior's home in Silver Spring,Md., near Washington, went unanswered. Later, an answering machinewas attached and there was no immediate response to requests forcalls to be returned.   The virus was introduced into the Arpanet, the Department ofDefense computer network, the Times said. It was intended to livethere innocently and undetected, slowly making copies that wouldmove from computer to computer, the report said.   But a design error caused it instead to replicate madly out ofcontrol, ultimately jamming more than 6,000 computers nationwide.   The virus apparently caused no damage other than the thousands ofhours that computer scientists and programmers were spending toremove it from their systems. By Friday, universities and researchcenters turned their computers back on.   Sources told the Times the younger Morris flew to WashingtonFriday and is planning to hire a lawyer and meet with officials ofthe Defense Communications Agency, in charge of the Arpanet network,to discuss the case.   His father, Robert Morris Sr., has written widely on the securityof the Unix operating system, the computer master program that wasthe target of his son's virus program, of which, the sources said,he had no prior knowledge.   The 56-year-old Morris told the Times in a telephone interviewFriday, that the virus was ``the work of a bored graduate student.''   He said his son was ``for his age very well trained in computerscience: he studied it in college and held various summer jobs atvarious places.''   The Times reported Friday that an anonymous caller to thenewspaper claimed that a graduate student had created the virus as aharmless experiment and became terrified of the consequences when itgot out of hand.   The elder Morris spoke in the presence of officials and lawyersof the National Security Agency and would not discuss the case indetail.   He is chief scientist at the National Computer Security Center inBethesda, Md., the arm of the National Security Agency devoted toprotecting computers against outside attack.   The elder Morris told the Times that he believed the virus mightultimately have a positive effect.   ``It has raised the public awareness to a considerable degree,''he said. ``It is likely to make people more careful and moreattentive to vulnerabilities in the future.''   Earlier, the FBI said it was launching a preliminary inquiry todetermine whether federal law had been violated.   Contacted about the Times report, FBI spokesman Lane Betts saidhe could add nothing beyond the prepared statement earlier in theday.   ``As the matter is currently under investigation, it would beinappropriate for me to comment on it,'' Betts said.</TEXT></DOC>
