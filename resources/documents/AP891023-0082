U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will join defense chiefs ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization for two days of nuclearstrategy talks, beginning Tuesday on the southern coast of Portugal.   ``There are no major decisions required at this meeting,'' saida senior NATO official. ``The nuclear affairs of the alliance arerunning along very smoothly at this time.''   Another official said: ``It will be a good occasion to takestock of nuclear matters.'' A third added, ``It's going to be arather uneventful meeting, but that's not necessarily a badthing.'' All spoke on condition of anonymity.   The meeting should be free of the tensions marking previoussessions of the Nuclear Planning Group when U.S. and Britishofficials clashed mostly with West Germans over development of anew theater nuclear missile.   President Bush and other leaders of the 16-nation allianceresolved the dispute at their 40th anniversary summit in May.   With that on the backburner, the defense ministers can discussthe dramatic events shaping East-West relations _ and how theyshould react.   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner was expected to ``callattention to the very positive changes'' in the Soviet bloccountries, said the senior NATO official.   Another official suggested the ministers urge the Soviet Unionto do more in reducing its nuclear stockpile. Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev has promised to pull out 500 short-rangenuclear weapons from Europe this year.   According to Western estimates, the Soviet Union has 1,450short-range nuclear missile launchers in Europe. NATO has 88 Lancelaunchers, most based in West Germany.   The ministers also were expected to discuss fresh contacts withEast bloc officials. Cheney met recently with Soviet DefenseMinister Dmitri Yazov.   But it appeared the key outcome would be asking top aides tomake a thorough study of the alliance's nuclear role in an era ofreduced tensions.   An official said the ministers would likely want ``anexamination of the implications of an agreement on conventionalforces in Europe ... for alliance nuclear forces.''   NATO negotiators are bargaining with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pactin Vienna to reach a quick agreement on sweeping reductions inconventional, or non-nuclear, weapons in Europe.   ``The positive nature of those (talks) gives us some hope thatwe can look forward to a reduction in conventional forces andsubsequent to that a reduction in nuclear forces,'' said theofficial. The deeper the conventional cuts, he said, the greaterthe impact on NATO's nuclear strategy.   ``I certainly wouldn't rule out that at some point in the futurewe decide certain elements of our nuclear posture are notnecessary,'' he said. ``(But) I think we're going to have to seesome major changes on the other side before that's true.''   He also said the allies ``see no time in which we will not needsome nuclear weapons.''   The United States also was expected to bring its allies up todate on bargaining with the Soviet Union on reducing long-rangenuclear forces.   Bush and other NATO leaders in May worked out a compromise onnegotiating with Moscow cuts in conventional and nuclear arms inEurope. The formula links reductions in conventional forces to thestart of talks on trimming short-range nuclear missiles in Europe.   West Germany had demanded immediate negotiations with the WarsawPact on slashing theater nuclear missiles. But U.S. and Britishofficials said attention should be focused first on cutting theEast's enormous superiority in conventional arms.   They also agreed the question of deploying a new, more powerfulgeneration of surface-to-surface nuclear missiles would be dealtwith in 1992. The United States had wanted a strong endorsement ofits development program to replace aging Lance missiles. The workis designed to more than triple the missile's range to just underthe limits of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.   Defense ministers meet twice a year to discuss nuclear matters.France, which is outside NATO's integrated military structure, doesnot attend. Iceland, which has no armed forces, has observer status.</TEXT></DOC>
