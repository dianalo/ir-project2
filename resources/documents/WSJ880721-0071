The rallies were helped by new reports that the five oil ministers of the price-monitoring committee of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet Aug. 3.    On European spot markets, the price of the widely traded North Sea Brent crude settled 25 cents higher, at about $15.30 a barrel. In futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate rose 43 cents to close at $15.66 a barrel.    The August contract for this benchmark U.S. crude, which went off the board yesterday, had opened lower on persistent selling but then surged in hectic midday trading in response to the positive news regarding the Middle East. &quot;There was a massive short-covering rally on speculation the cease-fire might go through,&quot; said Eric Bolling, a trader with Edge Trading Corp.    A short-covering rally occurs when traders who have sold contracts, expecting a price decline, buy them back to avoid making deliveries. Steven LaBonte, a Denver oil trader, said he expects a number of commodity firms to be covering their &quot;shorts&quot; today. &quot;We'll see a lot of higher numbers then,&quot; he said.    In the Persian Gulf developments, Iraq proposed direct talks with Iran, which had agreed earlier this week to accept a United Nations cease-fire resolution. That was followed by word from the U.N. that a peace-negotiating team would be sent immediately to the Gulf.    Also, there were public comments from oil officials of other OPEC members, including Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates, that an end to hostilities would help OPEC become a cohesive force in world oil markets again. The cartel has been divided -- rendered ineffectual, in fact -- by internal politics from the spillover of the eight-year war between two of its members.    In a statement issued yesterday by the official government news agency of the United Arab Emirates, Mana Said Otaiba, the oil minister, predicted that a cease-fire and restoration of relations in the group would boost oil prices to OPEC's target of $18 a barrel. The Emirates recently began deliberately ignoring the OPEC quota and is producing at a higher rate.    Many oil analysts suggest an end to the war might further weaken oil prices because of an expected new flood of petroleum on already-glutted markets, as both Iraq and Iran produce flat out to finance the rebuilding of their war-ravaged economies. But others, including many in OPEC, suggest that improved cooperation within the cartel from the two belligerents and their supporters would make it easier to get a grip on excess production. </TEXT></DOC>
