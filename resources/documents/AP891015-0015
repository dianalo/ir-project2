Storm watches were posted from Morgan City, La., on the centralLouisiana coast, westward to Port O'Connor, Texas, on the centralTexas coast. Watches east of Morgan City were withdrawn. Earlier,the storm watch had covered most of the Lousiana coast but onlysmall parts of Texas.   Storm winds were clocked at 65 mph this morning, up from 60 mphovernight.   ``Some slight increase in strength is likely before landfall,possibly bringing the winds to near hurricane force,'' Bb Sheets,director of the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables,said in an advisory.   Tropical storms become hurricanes when sustained winds reach 74mph.   A storm warning was expected to be issued later Sunday for partof the watch area, forecasters said.   They warned of severe coastal flooding because of thecombination of coastal tides, which are expected to reach a peakthis weekend, and the storm's surge.   ``Astronomical tides are expected to be the highest of the yearthis weekend, and in combination with storm-surge water levels thiscould produce dangerous coastal flooding, depending on the exactpath of the storm,'' Sheets said.   At 9 a.m. EDT, the center was located near latitude 27.7 north,longitude 94.0 west, or about 115 miles south-southeast ofGalveston, Texas. The storm was moving north-northwest at about 10mph, bringing the center near the upper Texas Coast late Sunday orearly Monday, said Sheets.  </TEXT></DOC>
