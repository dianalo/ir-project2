A 28-page report released by the coalition called for U.S.``stringent and comprehensive'' sanctions against South Africa,recognition of the government of Angola and an end to aid to theSouth African-supported group UNITA.   ``It is the strong feeling throughout the black Americancommunity that on the issues of foreign policy that the objectives,the recommendations of this report must be thoughtfully respondedto in exchange for black support in November,'' Randall Robinson,head of the anti-apartheid group TransAfrica, told reporters.   ``The Democratic Party can lose with our support, (but) theycannot win without it,'' he said. ``So all those who turned out inthe black community for the primary must turn out for MichaelDukakis if he has any chance of the White House. There is a pricefor that turnout.''   Throughout the long primary campaign, Dukakis has made fewovertures to black voters in deference to the popularity of JesseJackson.   In response to the report, Dukakis released a statement thatoutlined his support for the primary concerns of the group.   ``Apartheid is morally repugnant to all those who cherishfreedom and human dignity. South Africa has engaged in terroristacts,'' Dukakis said.   The report was authored and supported by the Congressional BlackCaucus, the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent SocialChange, the National Association for the Advancement of ColoredPeople, the National Council of Negro Women and the SouthernChristian Leadership Conference.</TEXT></DOC>
