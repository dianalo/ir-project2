According to published reports, at least three Palestinians havebeen killed and 70 wounded since the Israeli Army began usingplastic bullets a month ago. The bullets have been described bytheir defenders as non-lethal.   ``We believe that measures must be taken to reduce rather thanto increase casualties among Palestinian demonstrators,'' StateDepartment spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.   ``Thus we are disturbed by the rising casualties of Palestiniansin recent clashes with the Israeli military. We can see nojustification for a policy admittedly designed to cause an increasein casualties.''</TEXT></DOC>
