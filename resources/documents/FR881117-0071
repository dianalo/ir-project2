SPSI is also authorized to underwrite and deal in U.S. governmentsecurities pursuant to andSection; 225.25(b)(16) of the Board's RegulationY (``bank-eligible securities''). 12 CFR 225.25(b)(16).Security Pacific has applied to underwrite and deal in debt securitieswithin the framework of limitations established in the Board's <T3>Citicorp, J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. Incorporated and Bankers Trust NewYork Corporation</T3> Order, including the 5 percent gross revenue limitation.73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 473 (1987). Accordingly, under this applicationthe amount of gross revenue SPSI would receive from the proposed new ineligibleunderwriting activity and the previously approved ineligible activity wouldnot exceed in the aggregate 5 percent of the total gross revenues of SPSI.The Board has not previously determined that the proposed underwritingand dealing activities are permissible under section 4(c)(8) of the BankHolding Company Act. Section 4(c)(8) of the Act provides that a bank holdingcompany may, with Board approval, engage in any activity ``which the Boardafter due notice and opportunity for hearing has determined (by order orregulation) to be so closely related to banking or managing or controllingbanks as to be a proper incident thereto''.Security Pacific contends that the proposed activities are closely relatedto banking because banks have generally engaged in activities that arefunctionally and operationally similar to underwriting and dealing in debtsecurities. These services include underwriting and dealing in bank-eligibleand ineligible securities; investing, buying and selling investment qualitycorporate debt securities, as permitted by the Office of the Comptrollerof the Currency; arranging private placements of securities; providinginvestment advisory, investment management and trust services; providingletters of credit and other credit enhancements for private and publicissues of corporate debt; organizing loan syndications as well as purchasingand selling loans; and overseas underwriting and dealing.In determining whether an activity is a proper incident to banking, theBoard must consider whether the proposal may ``reasonably be expected toproduce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increasedcompetition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects,such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices''. Security Pacificmaintains that permitting bank holding companies to engage in the proposedactivities would result in increased competition which would lower underwritingspreads greater liquidity of the proposed securities, greater customerconvenience and increased efficiency. The proposed activities would alsopermit bank holding companies to further diversify income. Security Pacificcontends that the proposed activities would not result in adverse effectsbecause of the similarities in the general nature of the proposed activityand its current ineligible activity which the Board has previously determinedwould not result in adverse effects when undertaken in compliance withthe <T3>Citicorp/Morgan/Bankers Trust</T3> conditions and existing laws andregulations.Security Pacific contends that approval of the application would not bebarred by section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act (12 U.S.C. 377). Section20 of the Glass-Steagall Act prohibits the affiliation of a member bank,such as Security Pacific National Bank, with a firm that is ``engaged principally''in the ``underwriting, public sale or distribution'' of securities. SecurityPacific states that it would not be ``engaged principally'' in underwritingand dealing in securities in light of the 5 percent limitation on theseactivities. <T3>See, Citicorp, J.P.
