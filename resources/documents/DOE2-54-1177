The North American city with the greatest potential for expansionof district heating is Toronto, where a new development is planned foran 80-hectare area near the downtown core. This paper describes the presentdistrict heating system and its management, then sets out the proposalsfor district heating and cooling in the new expanded system. The currentsystem is a result of the integration of five separate district heatingsystems serving downtown commercial customers, hospitals, governmentbuildings, and the university. The expanded system would include a newheating plant, possibly using municipal refuse as a fuel, and a coolingplant possibly using Lake Ontario water.</TEXT></DOC>
