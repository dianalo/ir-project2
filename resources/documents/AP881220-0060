The appointment ended a 15-month standoff between the Vatican andclerics in Cologne.   Meisner was reportedly long backed by the pope but had beenopposed by some clerics in Cologne who are given a say in theselection process under a 1929 agreement between the Vatican and thestate of Prussia.   Reports from Germany said some Cologne churchmen viewed Meisneras too conservative. Several West German politicians also spoke outagainst the pope insisting on his man.   However, last Friday the clerics of the 16-member Cologne chapterelected Meisner, clearing the way for Tuesday's Vatican announcement.   Meisner, who will be 55 on Christmas, lives in East Berlin but isbishop of both sides of the divided city. He has served as Berlinbishop since April 1980 and was promoted to cardinal by John Paulthree years later.   The Cologne archbishop's post has been vacant since CardinalJoseph Hoeffner retired in September 1987. He died one month later.   The Vatican announcement gave no hint of the controversysurrounding the nomination. It noted, however, that the appointmentwas made in conformity with the 1929 agreement.   On Dec. 10, the Vatican made a rare public statement about anarchbishop's appointment, declaring that the pope had the right toname the Cologne prelate even if the local church was opposed to hischoice.   Cologne is considered particularly influential because itsarchbishop has traditionally headed the West German bishopsconference. The Roman Catholic Church in West Germany wieldsconsiderable influence at the Vatican and is the major financialcontributor after the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
