The Macintosh, for instance,was introduced by a $2 billion company that already had some experience ingenerating development support was considered a superior marketing company bymost analysts, and was one of the original PC companies.andP;  Without thoseadvantages - particularly its ability to win friends and influence theinfrastructure as an alternative to IBM - it's doubtful Apple could haveestablished the Macintosh as a viable platform.andP;  Power, however, is not amake-or-break element, since even IBM - the most powerful computer company inthe history of the industry- has lost its ability to establish new platformsall by itself.andP;  And power comes in many forms - the plain fact is that Nexthas power in the personal computer industry (much to Bill Gates' chagrin)simply based on the fact that it is run by Steve Jobs, who has managed toestablish two major platforms in the past.andP;  So people pay attention to whatJobs does and give him a lot of credibility, where others would have none.andO;Go Corp., however, scored a major coup (which is why the company had a pressconference without announcing or demonstrating its products) by getting IBMto buy into its new operating environment - without IBM, Go Corp. hadabsolutely no industry power except to the degree that it features acollection of high-powered industry executives, venture capitalists, andinsiders.andM;PATIENCE: Using the term &quot;Patience&quot; is supposed to cover a lot ofsub-elements in the platform game.andP;  Clearly, Microsoft benefitted in its longrunning attempt to establish Windows from the fact that it is an enormouslyprofitable, powerful, and technically adept company, all of which allowed itto continuously revise its product strategy over a number of years until itfound the element (linear memory in the protected mode) that would reallyturn on developers and customers.andP;  While it took Apple two years and onemajor revision to get the Macintosh launched, it took Microsoft five yearsand two major revisions.andP;  IBM also clearly has a lot of patience when itcomes to OS/2 (although there are still significant questions about howtechnically adept it is).andM;CONNECTIVITY: Unlike applications software, the concept of compatibility isnonsensical in the development of new platforms.andP;  Compatibility implies akind of operational similarity that means the user and the developer incur nopain for adopting the platform, which leads to the question:  Why have a newplatform if it works pretty much the same way as the old one?' In otherwords, there's no gain when there's no pain.andP;  Instead, with new platforms,the key issue is whether the vendor thought about and provided a way forcustomers to bring along their existing data files and, at the same time,provided for customers to use a mixture of old and new systems at the sametime.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
