(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The head of a leading Hollywoodvideo entertainment firm and his wife were slain in their mansion,and police searched for witnesses, motives and possible links toorganized crime.   The bodies of Jose E. Menendez, 45, and Mary Louise ``Kitty''Menendez, 44, were discovered late Sunday by their sons in their $4million Mediterranean-style home, police said Monday.   Menendez was chief executive officer and chairman of the board ofLIVE Entertainment Inc., an affiliate of Carolco Pictures Inc. inthe video and music software distribution business. He also onceheaded RCA@Ariola records and the U.S. rental car operations forthe Hertz Corp.   The couple, casually dressed, had been shot repeatedly. Menendez'body was found slumped over one end of a couch and his wife's bodywas on the floor at the other end of the couch, said coroner'sinvestigator Craig Harvey.   Police gave no motive in the killings and declined to reveal thetype of weapon used. Several people were questioned by police andreleased.   Investigators found no signs of a struggle or burglary. Thecouple's death was placed by the coroner's office at between 8 p.m.and 11 p.m. Sunday.   Officers went door-to-door on the Menendez' tree-lined street,one of Southern California's most affluent, looking for witnesses tothe first Beverly Hills homicide in more than a year.   The Menendezes moved to the house in October 1988, propertyrecords show. Over the years, the house had been leased for up to$35,000 a month to celebrities including singers Elton John andPrince, the U-2 rock band and several Arab sheiks.   Carolco is best known for producing the ``Rambo'' films starringSylvester Stallone, which have been one of its major sources ofincome.   Although no motive was offered, Beverly Hills detectives calledthe Los Angeles Police Department's Organized Crime IntelligenceDivision, asking for any information on Menendez, the Los AngelesTimes reported today.   A source told the Times the LAPD had no immediate information onthe executive.   In 1988, LIVE Entertainment acquired Strawberries Records, Tapesand CDS, a Milford, Mass.-based retail chain owned by Morris Levy, aNew York City record executive with alleged ties to organized crime,the Times reported.   Levy allegedly has long acted as a business front for Vincent``The Chin'' Gigante, reputed by law enforcement officials to be anunderboss of the Genovese crime family, according to authorities andrecords.   Levy was sentenced last year in New Jersey to 10 years in federalprison and fined $200,000 for conspiring to extort money from aPhiladelphia-area record distributor.   Menendez was an executive vice president and board member ofCarolco, which has a 48 percent voting interest in LIVE. Carolcofinances, produces and leases motion pictures for exhibition indomestic and foreign markets, and for later release in such media asvideo and pay and free television.   ``All of us at Carolco are shocked by the apparent murder of JoseMenendez and his wife,'' Carolco Pictures President and CEO PeterHoffman said in a statement.   In 1986, Menendez left RCA to run International VideoEntertainment (IVE), which holds the video rights to more than 1,300titles. A year later, IVE bought an interest in Minneapolis-basedLieberman Enterprises, which delivers video and music software tomajor retailers, to create LIVE Entertainment Inc.   Menendez was covered by a $15 million ``key man'' insurancepolicy with LIVE Entertainment as the beneficiary, according to aSecurities and Exchange Commission registration statement filed thisyear and obtained by the Times.</TEXT></DOC>
