The state news agency said prosecutors have begun investigatingpolice brutality at an anti-government rally on Friday in whichhundreds of peaceful demonstrators were clubbed.   And in Moscow, Mikhail S. Gorbachev backed the rapid changesencompassing Eastern Europe, including the demands for reform inCzechoslovakia. ``I think the changes under way now are consistentwith the overall context of the changing world,'' he said.   Premier Ladislav Adamec said for the first time that Communistauthorities were open to a dialogue with the opposition.   He told a delegation including opposition members that thehard-line leadership was willing to hold a dialogue and did notrule out talking with members of Charter 77, Eastern Europe'soldest human rights organization. The premier also said he favoredhaving non-Communists in government.   The premier met with a 10-member delegation that includedmembers of the newly formed Civic Forum opposition movement as wellas representatives of the Communist Party youth movement, the CTKstate new agency reported.   Members of the delegation quoted Adamec as saying, ``thesituation in the (state-controlled) mass media is intolerable,''and that he was in favor of a ``different concept of the leadingrole of the party.''   They also quoted him as saying he favored ``having in thefederal government people with no membership in a political partyand members of other political parties and especially youngpeople.''   A government spokesman, Marcel Jansen, denied earlier reportsthat the group included Vaclav Havel, a playwright andCzechoslovakia's best-known dissident. There were no immediatedetails on the talks.   Civic Forum, formed Sunday, is comprised of a dozen oppositiongroups. It has demanded the resignation of officials who carriedout purges following the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in1968 and those who ordered security forces to use violence to crushFriday's demonstrations.   A Communist-allied Czechoslovak newspaper, Lidova Demokrace,published an opposition call for the ouster of top Communists, ademand of the estimated 200,000 people who marched through Pragueon Monday with chants of ``Freedom!''   On Monday, the country's major state media also broke with pastpractice by providing extensive coverage of the march in thecapital _ Communist Czechoslovakia's largest anti-governmentdemonstration ever.   The coverage indicated the party leadership was increasinglyshifting to the East German approach of tolerating massive publicprotests.   CTK announced that the general prosecutor of the Czech republichad opened an investigation into the actions of security forcesFriday. Scores of demonstrators were beaten by riot police to breakup an anti-government rally.   Early today, posters condemning police brutality appeared onshop windows, office buildings and restaurants. The official CTKnews agency said about 200 to 300 young people held an all-nightvigil in downtown Wenceslas Square, where Monday's demonstrationbegan.   The pro-democracy tide now sweeping over one of the East bloc'slast strongholds of hard-line communism also spread Monday toprovincial cities, which saw their first big street demonstrationsin decades.   So far, however, there has been no indication that workers haveheeded student calls to join the strike.   Protesters waved ``V'' for victory signs in Prague, where agovernment-sponsored reform movement was crushed by a Soviet-ledinvasin 21 years ago. Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is nowencouraging East bloc allies to embrace popular demand for reforms.   Student strike committee leaders said demonstrations wouldcontinue daily at least through this week.   The announcement may have played a role in the suddencancellation of a scheduled visit that was to have begun today bynew East German leader Egon Krenz, who is under mounting popularpressure to resign.   The newspaper of the Communist-allied Christian DemocraticParty, Lidova Demokrace, published a statement today from the CivicForum opposition group that called for the resignation of Jakes andother top party officials.   The move appeared to indicate that some partners in theCommunist-dominated coalition are starting to distance themselvesfrom their ruling allies.   In Washington, the State Department canceled a planned visit byJan Fojtik, chief ideologist of the Czechoslovak Communist Party,because of the use of force against protesters.   Elsewhere in the East bloc:   In Bucharest, Romania, delegates to a Communist Party congresstoday extolled hard-line leader Nicolae Ceausescu and offeredlavish praise for his rejection of democratic reform. Ceausescu,the East bloc's fiercest hard-line leader, condemned reforms takingplace in neighboring nations Monday.   In East Germany, a state-run newspaper sharply criticized partychief Krenz today, saying he has not won popular trust. Also, aWest German newspaper, Bild, said Krenz could be ousted as thenation's senior leader within four weeks. Krenz himselfacknowledged in a nationally televised interview Sunday he couldlose his power during a party congress scheduled for Dec. 15-17.</TEXT></DOC>
