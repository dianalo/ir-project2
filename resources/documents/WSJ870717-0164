Affairs---They Press Firm to UpdateIts Lines and Its Methods,While Profiting Nicely---Fears of a Misunderstanding---By Laurie HaysStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> DD VOCHEMICALS, PLASTICS (CHM) </IN><TEXT>   One day five years ago, a Du Pont Co. manager met with the company's biggest shareholders, Seagram Co.'s chairman and co-chairman, Edgar M. and Charles R. Bronfman, to tell them about a new marketing effort. The manager presented slides and videos. He said he had consulted Harvard Business School professors.    His audience didn't seem impressed. Instead, the atmosphere grew chilly, he recalls, and the Bronfmans asked, &quot;Why haven't you brought in the greatest marketing people in the world -- us?&quot;    Today, Du Pont managers aren't likely to overlook the Bronfmans. Once thought of as outsiders who had sneaked into the company through the back door, the Canadian-born distillers now are playing a visible and vigorous role as advisers to the world's largest chemical concern.    Du Pont took on the Bronfmans as investors in 1981 in the course of playing white knight (and paying $6.8 billion) to save Conoco Inc. from a takeover by Seagram, a company the Bronfman family controls. The Conoco shares Seagram had accumulated were converted into Du Pont stock, and now Seagram has a 22.6% stake in the chemicals giant, valued at some $6.5 billion. Inside the company, the Bronfmans are referred to as &quot;the new du Ponts.&quot;    On the board of directors, Seagram appointees now outnumber du Pont family members. They get special briefings that officers once worked up only for the du Ponts. A team of Seagram advisers monitors the investment, and Seagram's board even meets once a year at Du Pont's Wilmington, Del., headquarters.    A three-bedroom suite at Wilmington's Hotel Du Pont has just been renovated for the Bronfmans. At one dinner party, hotel employees scrambled to find TV sets so the Canadian guests could watch the Montreal Expos baseball team, of which Charles Bronfman is the principal owner. Edgar Bronfman has been hobnobbing with the horsey set in nearby Chadds Ford, Pa.    The Canadians have their say about Du Pont affairs not just at board meetings but also, says Du Pont Chairman Richard Heckert, in &quot;the kind of dialogue that is half social, half business.&quot; He is quick to insist that the Bronfmans don't dictate policy. But their influence is evident.    The Bronfmans, for instance, apparently broke Du Pont of its longtime habit of issuing new shares for employee bonus and stock plans. The company had found this less bothersome than buying back stock, but when Seagram officials noticed, says William Buxbaum, a former chief financial officer at Du Pont, they phoned him to complain about the dilution.    &quot;They got a little bit alarmed,&quot; he recalls. &quot;But I ran upstairs {to the executive offices}, and we agreed this was a legitimate concern. I assured Seagram we would repurchase on the open market.&quot;    The Bronfmans &quot;don't walk down the hall saying, 'You're hired and you're fired,'&quot; explains Harold Fieldsteel, a former Seagram executive vice president and retired Du Pont director. &quot;But they are actively involved.&quot; On a scale of one to 10, he says, &quot;on major questions, their influence is an eight, nine or 10.&quot;    The Bronfmans will soon gain even more influence through a new retirement policy for Du Pont directors, adopted last fall but little noticed at the time. The policy calls for 10 du Pont family members and retired executives, including former Chairmen Charles B. McCoy, Crawford H. Greenwalt and Irving S. Shapiro, to leave the board by 1989. The first six, including Mr. McCoy, retired in May.    The resulting shrinkage of the board not only will accommodate the 25% Seagram representation provided by a 1986 standstill agreement but also, in a break with tradition, reduce to about 50% the representation of family members and current or former Du Pont executives. &quot;We have to make some room for the new owners,&quot; says Irenee du Pont Jr., a director and retired official.    Adds Mr. Shapiro, who will leave the board next year, &quot;This is a tacit recognition that the Bronfmans are the main players.&quot;    But the new ownership and board structure pose some potential problems. Some company officials worry that the board's institutional memory will be hurt by the loss of three former chairmen. And no matter how comfortable Du Pont's relationship with the Bronfmans is now, the balance remains delicate. Fears lurk that a misunderstanding could cause bad feeling and wreck the marriage.    Mr. Heckert acknowledges the concern. &quot;I now have what I consider to be an excellent ownership structure,&quot; the chairman says. &quot;You'll forgive me if I tell you I don't want it screwed up.&quot; As for the Bronfmans, they decline to be interviewed about the relationship.    The very existence of such a large block of stock as the Bronfmans' worries some Du Pont people. They are nervous about a recent public disagreement between the Bronfman brothers over the succession at Seagram, of which Bronfman family members own more than 38%; speculation about a rift intensified when the Bronfmans decided to dissolve their joint investment holding company, Cemp Investments Ltd. Some at Du Pont wonder whether the stake held by Seagram could someday end up in the hands of Bronfman heirs who aren't friendly to management of Du Pont or knowledgeable about its business.    &quot;Selling booze and wine isn't the same thing as running a world-wide chemical company,&quot; notes one disgruntled Du Pont director, who adds that, in his view, the Bronfman &quot;children aren't demonstrating that they are great businessmen.&quot;    Ten years ago, the company and the du Pont family dissolved Christiana Securities, the holding company for the family's 28% stake, because of worries about the next generation's lack of involvement with the company or knowledge of its operations. With the Bronfmans' indirect stake in Du Pont, contends Mr. Shapiro, &quot;what you've done is create a new Christiana, with all its problems.&quot;    But for now, the alliance appears to be steady. Seagram has been given enough positions on the Du Pont board to make sure the Bronfmans' views are heard, and Du Pont is resting easier because a standstill agreement bars Seagram from acquiring more than a 25% stake in Du Pont until 1999. The Bronfmans now &quot;are playing as part of the team,&quot; says John L. Weinberg, the chairman of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and a Du Pont director chosen by Seagram. &quot;We've become part of the Du Pont management structure.&quot;    Meanwhile, Seagram's investment in Du Pont is paying off nicely; last year, it yielded $323.2 million of the liquor company's net income of $423.5 million.    The transition, however, wasn't smooth. When Seagram first gained its interest by buying 27.8 million Conoco shares and exchanging them for 47.4 million Du Pont shares, it was granted only three seats on a 31-member board. And Du Pont found itself scrambling to teach the Bronfmans about their new investment, providing them with a week of chemistry classes and a demonstration of how nylon is made. They asked so many questions that an officer had to be assigned full time to answer them.    Edgar Bronfman also managed to offend some people at Du Pont. In 1985 he publicly criticized its then-lagging core business of synthetic fibers (a portion of which has since been sold) and boasted to the press that he had helped pick the company's next chairman, Mr. Heckert. The appointment hadn't yet been made public, and his remarks rankled some officials. &quot;Edgar has a big mouth,&quot; says Harold May, a retired Du Pont executive.    Analysts and investors were calling the company frequently those days to ask how much power it was going to give the Bronfmans. Du Pont finally agreed to increase Seagram's role on the board to match its investment, in exchange for assurances that the Canadian company wouldn't buy more than 25% of Du Pont's stock. &quot;We wanted the standstill extended so people wouldn't think there would be some war,&quot; says David Barnes, a Du Pont director and former officer.    Some insiders say the Bronfmans have brought greater financial savvy to the board. They have come aboard at a time when Du Pont is trying to become less a family-run business and more a company of professional managers. In the past five years, it has retired more than 25,000 employees and removed layers of management, while linking salaries and bonuses more closely to performance.    &quot;Du Pont has been inbred for a long time,&quot; says Anantha Raman, an industry analyst who follows the company closely. &quot;They needed outside blood to move into the 20th century.&quot;    The Bronfmans have become visible allies of Du Pont's drive to sell some lagging traditional businesses and instead focus on acquisitions in life sciences. They have devoted many hours to learning about the new fields, according to David D. Mooberry, Du Pont's group vice president of medical products. When the company was preparing to buy a drug business called American Critical Care last year, Charles Bronfman questioned Mr. Mooberry closely on the pros and cons.    &quot;The company is changing,&quot; says Mr. Mooberry. &quot;We have a stronger focus on shareholders, and all those kinds of things Mr. Heckert talks about are consistent with what {the Bronfmans} would like to see from a company.&quot;    Some Du Pont managers say that while the company has been cutting costs and bureaucracy since the Bronfmans' arrival, it has loosened the purse strings in other ways. It spent more than $1 billion on acquisitions last year, in agricultural chemicals as well as in the health field. Recently, Seagram's director of consumer research visited Wilmington to teach Seagram's methods of pinpointing consumer trends.    But Du Pont executives bristle at the suggestion that Seagram has originated ideas or dictated policy changes. The Bronfman-Du Pont arrangement is no &quot;master-servant relationship,&quot; Mr. Heckert declares.    He says that he began long ago trying to improve marketing and increase shareholder value and that Du Pont is shrinking the board not just to give the Canadians a bigger role but also because directors have found it unwieldy. &quot;This was a nice confluence of objectives,&quot; he says. &quot;I want to get away from a show-and-tell kind of board meeting, which is what we've really had in the past, to a participative-type meeting where everyone has a chance to react when they have views on each important issue.&quot;    Still, Mr. Heckert says the Bronfmans have been &quot;constructive participants&quot; in such areas as direct marketing to consumers and corporate financing. &quot;Those are areas where we're particularly inclined to check with them when we're wanting to do something, to make sure their view of life is similar to ours,&quot; the Du Pont chairman says. &quot;They are just good business people broadly, and I think we have benefited from their inputs.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
