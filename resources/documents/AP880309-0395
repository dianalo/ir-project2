Local union leaders said Wednesday they favor early talks andUAW Vice President Marc Stepp has said ``the earlier the better,''but one issue must be settled first: Will Chrysler also agree to anearly strike deadline?   ``Our preference would be to actually start the clock ... a realstrike deadline as opposed to an artificial bargaining deadline,''UAW spokesman Peter Laarman said.   Chrysler's three-year national contract, which governs wages andbenefits for 71,700 workers, expires Sept. 14. Talks normally wouldbegin in July, but Chrysler asked for early talks last week.   Chrysler made the request after it succumbed to UAW pressure anddecided against selling its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc. partssubsidiary. As an alternative, the company said it would close fourAcustar plants if it could not sell them in the next 18 months.   Angry workers had threatened a series of plant-by-plant strikesover local issues and had stopped cooperating in union-managementprograms essential to improving quality and production efficiency.   The No. 3 automaker doesn't appear willing to let the union seta deadline before Sept. 14, after which workers could legallystrike the company if no settlement were reached, Laarman said.   Chrysler's chief negotiator and vice president for humanresources, Anthony St. John, told The Detroit News on Tuesday thatthe company doesn't want an early strike deadline, but the companywould not comment Wednesday.   St. John and Stepp both were in Milwaukee on Wednesday fornegotiations on a plant closing agreement for 5,500 workers at theformer American Motors Corp. assembly and stamping plants inKenosha, Wis.   Stepp has said he would recommend early talks when he meetsThursday with the UAW's national Chrysler bargaining council, whichrepresents workers at 49 local unions. The council will make itsdecision Thursday afternoon.   Local union leaders said they would support early talks becauseit would increase chances of protecting jobs and of ironing outmounting difficulties in plant-level labor relations.   ``I'm positive our membership would be 100 percent in favor ofthat. As long as we're talking about jobs they would be more thanwilling,'' said Fred O'Brien, an official with Local 1264 atChrysler's key Sterling Heights stamping plant.   If talks begin early on the national contract, local unionswould follow suit on plant-level contracts, which govern workingconditions and other issues specific to them, Laarman said.   Chrysler is expected to agree to the job-protecting patterncontract established last fall at Ford Motor Co. and General MotorsCorp.   Chrysler's contract lacks protections included in the GM andFord pacts and workers said they want to sign a similar contract assoon as possible.   The GM and Ford contracts forbid layoffs except when productionis cut because of slow sales, make it harder for the companies tomove production outside the company or country and forbid plantclosings that were not announced before talks started.   O'Brien said going to the table early would limit the timeChrysler has to announce further plant closings and make it easierfor the union to battle the possible closings of the four Acustarplants.   In addition, Chrysler already buys the largest percentage ofoutside parts of any Big Three maker _ 70 percent compared with 30percent at GM and about 50 percent at Ford.   O'Brien said workers are anxious to sign a contract that keepsChrysler from moving more parts work to outside non-union ``scabshops'' or ``we'll all be on welfare.''   Chrysler also has no profit-sharing program. Stepp said lastweek that he would particularly like to see the Ford profit-sharingformula included in the Chrysler contract.   Ford workers Tuesday received profit-sharing checks averagingmore than $3,700 from Ford's industry-record 1987 profits of $4.6billion.</TEXT></DOC>
