California, struggling with the largest budget gap everfaced by a state, last week lifted the sales tax exemptionfor newspapers and magazines, no matter where they're based,as part of a broad package of new taxes. In Connecticut,where some state services were forced to close temporarily,some lawmakers have budget proposals that include taxing thesale and subscription for all printed media. And Texaslegislators are expected to consider the repeal of thesales-tax exemption on newspapers and magazine subscriptions(Texas already taxes the over-the-counter sale of magazines.)</LP><TEXT>   For large publishers, the solution will likely be to passalong the taxes by raising home-delivery rates and newsstandprices. But the alternative press and free communitypublications are up in arms, because they believe such taxesdiscriminate against them to the advantage of bigpaid-subscription competitors. They can't pass along costs tosubscribers, and will be taxed, at least in California, on aformula based on their costs of printing, paper and ink.   &quot;Legislators are saying, `We will make it more expensiveand difficult for people to keep informed,'&quot; says RaymondJansen, publisher and chief executive officer of Times MirrorCo.'s Hartford Courant, the state's largest daily. Mr. Jansensays a tax would add $12 on the Courant's annual subscriptionrate of $159. &quot;It may not seem like much, but for people onfixed income, they could easily drop home delivery and onlybuy the paper on certain days,&quot; he says. &quot;Losing subscribersis the last thing the newspaper industry needs.&quot;   At least 10 states already have varying forms of salestaxes on print media, but most of them are sparsely populatedstates in the South and West. Newspaper sales-tax proposalsin seven other states were defeated this year; for example,New York Gov. Mario Cuomo put a tax on magazines in lastyear's state budget, but publishing lobbyists got it removed.Still, publishers now fear lawmakers in other large, heavilypopulated states will follow California's lead, where intenselobbying by California publishers failed to sway lawmakers.   &quot;The California tax caught a good part of the publishingindustry by surprise,&quot; says Danforth W. Austin, circulationdirector of The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by DowJones andamp; Co. &quot;It's a trend state. Given the physicalconditions of other states, this could be the harbinger ofmore to come.&quot; The Journal has a circulation of 245,000 inCalifornia alone.   Major dailies are perplexed about how pennies will becollected in street vending boxes and newsstands. Last week,readers in Los Angeles had to fumble to come up with 37 centsfor newsstand copies of the Los Angeles Times.   Larger media companies are calling the tax an&quot;administrative nightmare&quot; that follows a major postal rateincrease earlier this year and comes in the middle of arecession that has already cut into publishers' revenues.&quot;Our real concern is the additional cost to administer thetax on subscriptions,&quot; says Victor Rappa, treasurer at LosAngeles-based Knapp Communications Corp., publisher ofupscale magazines Architectural Digest and Bon Appetit.   Pushed by their own budget problems, Connecticut lawmakersare expected to consider a tax on newspapers and magazines,though it's unclear whether proposals will targetsubscriptions or just over-the-counter sales.   Publishers question how well states can collect their newmedia taxes. Connecticut estimates it can raise $28 millionannually from media taxes. The Connecticut Daily NewspaperAssociation puts the figure at $6 million, considering thestate will have to rely on route carriers to collect tax fromhome subscribers.   Texas has seen the media tax war before. Prior to 1977,all Texas magazines and newspapers were taxed. At a speciallegislative session that year, lawmakers passed a bill toexempt the sale and subscription of newspapers andsubscriptions of magazines, but not the newsstand sale ofmagazines. During a budget squeeze in 1984, legislators atthe last moment eliminated the tax exemption for all printedmedia, with the exception of religious periodicals. TexasMonthly challenged the constitutionality of that exemptionand won its case in the Supreme Court. Texas lawmakers thenrewrote state laws so taxes weren't based on a publication'scontent. By 1987, after heavy lobbying, the sales-taxexemptions for printed media were reinstated, thoughnewsstand sales of magazines -- but not newspapers -- arestill taxed.   Michael R. Levy, publisher of Texas Monthly, says hedoesn't expect the exemption to be lifted, because lawmakersknow collecting taxes from out-of-state magazines isdifficult. But Karol Rice, lobbyist for the Texas Council ofAdvertising andamp; Magazine Publishing, says she expects a taxmeasure on print media in the special session. &quot;There isstill a gap in the state budget, so we are on alert,&quot; Ms.Rice said.   California is expected to be much more diligent in itsefforts to collect from out-of-state magazine publishers andall forms of newspapers, paid or free. The tax, which wasalso levied on snack food and candy bars, applies toCalifornia-based publishers, but also tags all out-of-statemagazines that have a physical presence in California, suchas a sales office, or who solicit subscriptions in the state.   Vanity Fair, published by New York-based Conde NastPublications Inc., has paid circulation of 100,000, largelyin Southern California, out of its total circulation of800,000. Time Warner Inc. magazines, such as Time and People,circulate heavily in California. &quot;It will affect our pricingoffers&quot; by requiring special ones for California, says a TimeInc. magazine executive. &quot;It's an additional cost of doingbusiness, and the reader pays for that in the end.&quot;   In California the new tax on newspapers and magazinesshould raise about $83 million (more than bottled water butless than Cracker Jacks and Cheez-Its). Big newspapers likethe Los Angeles Times are passing along the tax, which totals$17 million a year to the paper, by raising home-deliveryrates and newsstand prices.   As for smaller papers in California, &quot;It's not unrealisticthat some small publishers could be put out of business,&quot;says Allan Halcrow, president of Western PublicationsAssociation, which represents 250 California magazines.   &quot;Many free newspapers may be forced to cease publication,costing the community jobs and eliminating the only source oflocal news and affordable advertising for small businesses,&quot;argues William H. Fleet, publisher of the Los AngelesIndependent newspapers, a chain of four free-distributioncommunity papers.   California publishers have found some relief. Late lastThursday, the state Senate approved a measure that would makethe media tax apply only to subscriptions entered into orpaid after last Monday. Publishers feared they would have togo back to collect a tax from subscribers who had alreadypaid.   Politically, Tom Newton, California Newspaper PublishersAssociation staff attorney, said the budget gap was so bigthat it was impossible to escape some sort of tax. &quot;We alllost in this particular legislative session, because of theunprecedented budget problem,&quot; he says of periodicals, snackfood, etc. &quot;The Legislature wasn't focused on details, andjust bludgeoned it through.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
