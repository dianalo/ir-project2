No group immediately claimed responsibility for killing JohnCurrie, 31, but suspicion fell on the mainly Roman Catholic IrishRepublican Army, which is fighting to drive the British out ofProtestant-dominated Northern Ireland.   Published reports said Currie, a Protestant, repaired vehiclesowned by members of the security forces. The IRA repeatedly haswarned civilians against carrying out work for the police or othersecurity personnel in the province.   The gunmen singled out Currie from among several of hiscolleagues in the workshop in Portadown, 25 miles southwest ofBelfast, said police Inspector Fred Campbell. They escaped in ahijacked car whose owner was held captive in a disused house innearby Lurgan, Campbell said.   Currie was the 54th civilian to die this year in political andsectarian violence in Northern Ireland. More than 2,700 people havebeen killed in nearly 20 years of violence in the province.</TEXT></DOC>
