Teen-age sons in two-worker families spend less time onhousehold chores than sons in families with the mother athome, according to research by two Arizona sociologists. Butteen-age daughters in two-career families spend more time oncooking, laundry, car and household repairs and the like, thestudy suggests.   Sons in dual-career families spent less than three hours aweek on chores, compared with seven hours in one-careerfamilies. Daughters, on the other hand, spent 10 hours aweek, compared with eight hours in one-worker homes. Familiesin which both parents worked full time showed the biggestsuch difference of all family types surveyed, including thosewhere the mother worked part time.   &quot;Working parents are so pressed for time that they dowhat's expedient,&quot; says Mary Holland Benin, an associateprofessor at Arizona State University and co-author of thestudy, published in the Journal of Marriage and the Family.Parents perhaps see daughters as more willing -- andtrustworthy -- to start dinner or do laundry. &quot;Mothers maythink, `Oh, my son will ruin my good blouse. He'll wash it inhot water,'&quot; Ms. Benin says.   The study casts doubt on the notion that the sons oftoday's working moms will do more chores as adults than theirfathers did. If the pattern persists, &quot;the problem ofinequality in household division of labor is likely tocontinue into the next generation,&quot; the study concludes.                                                                                                          IRS Just Can't Whip   Babysitters Into Line                                                                                                          AN Internal Revenue Service crackdown on babysitters andother child-care givers hasn't erased the industry'stradition of cheating on taxes.   In 1989, the IRS began requiring taxpayers claiming achild-care credit to give the name, address and SocialSecurity number of the care giver. The rules spurred a 30%drop in taxpayers claiming the child-care credit and a 64%increase in people who reported receiving child-care income.   Nevertheless, an estimated 40% to 60% of the nation'ssitters and home day-care providers are still paid cash underthe table, industry placement and training workers say.Paying cash boosts sitters' take-home pay and saves parentsthe expense and hassle of withholding and paying taxes.   &quot;A lot of families still don't want to deduct taxes andpay Social Security,&quot; says Cathie Robertson, head of ananny-training program at Grossmont College in San Diego.Training programs teach sitters to demand that taxes bewithheld, but many don't know or care about Social Securityand other benefits of taxpayer status.   &quot;I recently placed a 52-year-old nanny who insisted oncash,&quot; says Lee Hansen of Nannies Unlimited, a Duluth, Minn.,agency. &quot;I said, `This is between you and your employer, butI think you're making a big mistake.'&quot;                                                                                                          For Flexible Schedules,   Stop Counting Heads                                                                                                          SOME companies are taking innovative routes to an oldgoal: flexible scheduling.   Aetna Life andamp; Casualty and Hewlett-Packard are attackingmiddle-management resistance to flexible scheduling bychanging how they count employees. Instead of counting headsas a basis for staffing and evaluating managers' performance,they count &quot;full-time equivalent units&quot; -- total hoursworked, divided by the length of the work day.   The change protects managers from having to explaincontinually why part-timers, job-sharers and other flextimerson their staffs aren't carrying a full work load. The numberof Aetna employees on part-time and other flexible scheduleshas risen steadily since the change two years ago.Hewlett-Packard sees another advantage: better internalreporting of personnel costs.                                                                                                          American Telephone andamp; Telegraph is giving 153,000rank-and-file workers some of the same flexibility asmanagement by letting them take personal leave on shortnotice in chunks as small as two hours. InternationalBusiness Machines lets its 205,500 U.S. workers lengthenlunch hours and shift work schedules by as much as two hours,helping them run family errands and make the day-care centeron time.                                                                                                          Plans for Long-Term Care   Attract Little Interest                                                                                                          WORKERS are surprising their employers by turning down anew benefit: long-term-care insurance at reduced rates forthemselves and their aging parents and in-laws.   By the end of last year, 135 companies were offering grouplong-term-care insurance, covering nursing-home, in-home andday-care services for the aged, according to the HealthInsurance Association of America.   At most companies, only 5% to 15% of eligible employeeshave purchased coverage for themselves, says Dennis DeWitt,managing consultant with A. Foster Higgins andamp; Co. Coverage forparents and in-laws has drawn scant interest. CNA Insurance,a big carrier based in Chicago, sees enrollments of less than1% for parents and in-laws.   One reason is cost. Workers save 5% to 15% on premiumsthrough employer-sponsored group plans, but coverage for anaging parent can still cost $1,200 or more annually. Anotheris education: Long-term-care insurance is unfamiliar to mostworkers.   It can also bring up the touchy issue of putting parentsin a nursing home. Bruce L. Boyd, vice president, productdevelopment and distribution for Teachers Insurance andamp; AnnuityAssociation, says, &quot;The key is, how do employees raise thiswith a parent?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
