MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Whatever the odds on Manuel Noriega's lease onpower in Panama, they have to be heavily against the kind of tidy,tied-down coup the administration seems to envision as a way to getrid of him.   After the coup that failed, Congress sounds more willing thanthe administration to take risks _ or at least to encouragePresident Bush to take them _ provided they pay off in the ousterof the Panamanian military boss.   But stripping a strongman of his power is a risky enterprise,with no guarantees. It does not lend itself to scripts written inWashington for execution without peril to American forces andinterests.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the administrationwould want better conditions and a better atmosphere in order tocommit American forces to a future move against Noriega.   Baker said the message sent to U.S. commanders at the time ofthe Oct. 3 coup attempt was to go ahead with support ``if therewere an opportunity to do this without risking bloodshed andsignificant loss of American life and to do so without openmilitary involvement ...''   In congressional debate about what went wrong and who's to blamethere has little talk about the risks involved in promoting oraiding an attempt to topple Noriega by force, and then arrest himon two U.S. drug trafficking indictments.   Noriega has withstood 2{ years of U.S. efforts, under twoadministrations, to push him out with economic and diplomaticsanctions. An earlier coup attempt was crushed, as was the attemptof a Panamanian president to dismiss him. He cancelled the resultsof an election after it had been held because it was going againsthim. Sanctions were stiffened and reinforcements sent to the12,000-man U.S. garrison in Panama. The Organization of AmericanStates tried to negotiate the peaceful transfer of power to ademocratic government, without success.   So much for persuasion. That leaves force.   Intervention in support of the coup attempted by dissidentmembers of the Panama Defense Forces could have led to U.S.casualties. Baker argues that American lives should not be put atrisk on the basis of ``somebody else's plan and somebody else'sschedule.''   Then again, a coup attempt based on a U.S. plan and timetablewould have built-in liabilities. Noriega already claims hisopponents are Yankee lackeys bent on helping the United States holdonto the Panama Canal. Open intervention would stir troubleelsewhere in Latin America and could strengthen opponents of U.S.bases elsewhere.   Although the White House is reviewing the way it is set up togather information and make decisions in times of crisis, Bush'sspokesman said that is because of concern about the process, notbecause of second thoughts about using U.S. forces in support ofthe coup attempt.   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said baloney to thesuggestion that Bush didn't get the information he needed on whichto base a decision.   ``He made the decision he thought was best and the decision westill think is right,'' Fitzwater said Tuesday.   Nor, he said, is there any change in the administration's policyof encouraging the Panamanians to oust Noriega, despite the criticswho say that carried with it some obligation to help rebelliousofficers who tried to do the job.   Bush has suggested repeatedly that the Panama Defense Forces getrid of the general, saying the United States has no quarrel withthe organization, only with Noriega and his cadre. He repeated thatmessage the day after the aborted coup.   ``And we'll continue to speak out in that area,'' Fitzwater said.   Administration officials have been doing so.   John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, said in aSaturday interview on Cable News Network that he thinks Noriegawill be ousted within six months. ``If you want odds, I'd say 8 to5 that he probably will be out,'' Sununu said.   Baker wasn't quoting odds, but he said the pressure will stayon. ``And we're not going to rule out the use of force, eitherforce that we ourselves plan totally and directly or force inconjunction with some other operation,'' Baker said Sunday on NBC'sMeet the Press.   Administration spokesmen fanned out to the network talk shows asBush was criticized from both the right and the left for failing toorder U.S. military action in support of the coup.   The Senate approved a measure expressing support for efforts bythe president to ``use the full range of appropriate diplomatic,economic and military options'' to protect Americans, guard thecanal, remove Noriega and restore constitutional government.   Republicans complained that some Democrats who had opposedintervention in other crises were retroactively endorsing it in thePanama coup.   ``Failure is the father of about a hundred hawks on Capitol Hillnow,'' said Sen. William S. Cohen, R-Maine.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
