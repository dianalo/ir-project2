By using computer, distribution of potential drop was obtainedfor some types of crack as database, and maximum potential drop amongthe measured potential distribution with its distance from origin werereferred to the database to obtain the shape of crack and its location.This method was applied to detect the fatigue crack of stainless pipewith the result of good consistency.
