But they declined to say what retaliation Washington may take if the Airbus countries don't agree to U.S. proposals for restrictions on government aid to the consortium.    The two U.S. officials said they want to establish specific &quot;benchmarks&quot; to monitor whether government aid to Airbus stays within limits on aircraft aid set under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. They said that if subsidies aren't controlled, the world aircraft industry could become subsidized and uncompetitive.    French and British officials rejected U.S. complaints about subsidies, saying that their aid falls within GATT rules.    The U.S. officials are scheduled to travel to West Germany for meetings today. </TEXT></DOC>
