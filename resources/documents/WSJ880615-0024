The &quot;rollover&quot; of the current quotas seemed the easiest -- and perhaps the only -- way out of an 8-5 split in the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The majority wanted some cuts in production limits, even if only a symbolic cut, to help prop up the price of oil. But five Persian Gulf producers led by Saudi Arabia pressed for increases in production quotas because of expected higher demand.    &quot;We would have liked an increase in production -- especially in view of the fact that there is robust demand (expected) in the fourth quarter,&quot; said Hisham M. Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister. &quot;For the sake of a consensus, we have agreed to a rollover.&quot;    On the other side, Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, the oil minister of Venezuela, who had aggressively sought production cuts, called the agreement a reasonable outcome. &quot;I hope that gradually the market is going to improve a little,&quot; he said.    The immediate reaction of world oil markets was positive, if tepid. On European spot markets, North Sea Brent crudes rose about 20 cents to around $16 a barrel. On U.S. futures markets, West Texas Intermediate closed at $16.85 a barrel, up 40 cents.    But oil markets remain fundamentally weak. Excess inventories are estimated to total 100 million to 200 million barrels. Continued cheating on OPEC production quotas -- or increased cheating, which seems likely -- could put new downward pressure on prices.    Saudi Arabia, OPEC's powerhouse, has been staying within its quota. But it signaled here that if cheating continues, it will join in.    &quot;The Saudis are losing patience,&quot; one OPEC source said. &quot;If they see no one is respecting quotas, they will raise production.&quot;    Since Jan. 1, OPEC's production limit has totaled 15.1 million barrels a day for the 12 nations that are parties to the agreement. Iraq remains outside the agreement, refusing to accept any quota smaller than the 2.4 million barrels a day assigned to its war foe, Iran. Iraq currently produces 2.8 million barrels a day, according to its oil minister.    Several other OPEC members, meanwhile, are exceeding their quotas, and the United Arab Emirates has publicly demanded an increase in its quota, although the UAE has consistently exceeded whatever quota it has had.    As a result of all this, production is believed to be too high for the normally weak third quarter, although demand for OPEC oil is expected to increase toward the end of the year.    &quot;Right now, production is 18.5 million barrels a day --at least,&quot; said Nordine AitLaoussine, a former senior Algerian oil official now a Geneva-based consultant. &quot;OPEC shouldn't produce more than 17.5 million barrels a day in the third quarter and 18.5 million in the fourth,&quot; he said.    Mana Said Otaiba, the UAE oil minister, left Vienna Sunday after failing to win the OPEC presidency he sought but returned late yesterday. The conference then unanimously elected Subroto, the popular former Indonesian oil minister, as OPEC's secretary-general. That post had been vacant for five years because of political controversy arising from the Iraq-Iran war.    But even though OPEC finally chose a secretary-general, it laid aside several other issues related to production quotas.    The task of defining &quot;crude oil&quot; under the quota system, for example, was handed over to a technical committee. The question had been raised by Kuwait over Venezuela's treatment of oil condensates, light liquids that are excluded from quotas. Venezuela had in turn pressed Saudi Arabia and Kuwait over their Neutral Zone &quot;war relief&quot; crude produced for Iraq's benefit. Because Iraq is outside the quota agreement, 300,000 barrels a day of this oil also escapes the quota system.    The ministers did not spend much time on either the Iraq or the Neutral Zone question. Nor did they make much progress toward the cooperation recently sought by non-OPEC producers in trimming the world oil glut. The OPEC ministers said they will continue contacts with non-OPEC exporters to seek a basis for long-term cooperation.    &quot;This rollover is effectively a muddling through,&quot; said Bahman Karbassioun, a Vienna consultant on OPEC affairs. &quot;None of the major issues -- the Neutral Zone, Iraq and OPEC/non-OPEC -- have been resolved.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
