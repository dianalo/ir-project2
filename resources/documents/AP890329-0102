Robert George can still invite terminally ill children to visit``Santa's Dreamworld'' in his garage, but the thousands of lightsand decorations on the lawn have to go _ except for the monthbefore Christmas.   ``To me it's a big victory,'' said George, 64.   George has been battling Glendale over complaints from neighborsirritated by the huge number of visitors, as many as 15,000 eachyear, to his three-bedroom house 15 miles north of Los Angeles.   The American Civil Liberties Union intervened on George's behalfafter a ruling in November 1987 restricting activities at his house.   Lawyer Carol Sobel said a ruling by the 2nd Appellate DistrictCourt on Monday defended George's constitutional rights.   The court upheld limits on the number of decorations at George'shouse and the months they could be illuminated, but said he couldbe Santa Claus 12 months of the year.   The retired Nebraska barber has been recognized as thepresidential Santa Claus since 1956, when Dwight D. Eisenhowerinvited him to the White House. He made his last White Houseappearance during Jimmy Carter's presidency.</TEXT><DATELINE>IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Benevolent and Loyal Order OfPessimists has decided to nix its plans for an annual convention.   It wouldn't have been any fun, and besides, ``Traditions requiretoo much optimism,'' says President Jack Duvall.   The group has been meeting each year since 1975 on a weekendclosest to April 15, income tax day and also the anniversary of thesinking of the Titanic, which Duvall calls ``a monument tooptimism.''   ``We just don't think you should get unrealistic hopes up,''Duvall said. ``You'll only make yourself unhappy.''   Duvall, which is not his real name, said he didn't want todivulge his identity or have his picture taken because he wasworried about losing his job.   The club, which he says has a worldwide membership in the``mid-three digits,'' formed by happenstance.   A group of about a dozen friends met 14 years ago in a smallrestaurant in Tiffin, Iowa to celebrate a friend's 30th birthday,Duvall said. Also meeting at the restaurant was a group ofoptimists.   ``After a few drinks some words were exchanged and we decidedthe world really needed a pessimists group to counteract theinfluence of these bizarre optimists and their strange rituals.''   At the annual conference, winners of the ``Pessimist of theYear'' award get ``a nice trophy in the shape of the rear end of ahorse,'' Duvall said.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An edible Eiffel Tower is the piece deresistance of a French exhibition that features the cookie as art.   The exhibition, which opens April 5 at the French Institute,shows paintings, photographs and cartoons commissioned since 1983by the BSN Group, a French food company.   The collection was built around Firmin Bouisset's original 1897painting of ``The Little Schoolboy.'' It ranges from a Marc Riboudphoto series of a cookie-clasping Marcel Marceau to Italian artistLanfranco Antonello's intricate collage, made of dried leaves,depicting a pastry shop.   The 7-foot-tall wooden tower, studded with cookies stuck tocolorful frosting, was done by Dorthee Selz of Paris, a creator ofedible art.   ``It's like architecture for me,'' said Selz. She confided, ``Idon't eat cookies too much.''   Bowls of cookies will be strategically placed around the exhibituntil April 29, when art-lovers will be allowed to devour thetower. Until then, if any wayward nibbling occurs, ``I don't wantto know about it,'' said Selz.</TEXT></DOC>
