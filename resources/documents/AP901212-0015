How about a gadget that opens and closes toilet lids, no hands?   Or a box that creates your own subliminal advertising -injecting microsecond-long messages into your TV, which could helpyou kick a cigarette or other drug habit.   Well they exist, on display at Toronto's New Product Store - ahome for the mad scientist and crazy inventor.   The business was founded a year ago by Brian Gray, his brotherJoseph, and Ed Zwolinski.   ``Brian Gray was a frustrated inventor,'' says Zwolinski, whomanages the place. ``He had a line of hardware products - a radongas detector, a disco music light box, custom construction hardhats - and was frustrated by all the doors closed to him, beingtold to buzz off.''   He says the biggest problem for inventors is skepticism.   ``It's so hard to get attention. You really have to have a lotof clout behind you. One person alone doesn't have that.''   The New Products Store can't offer much in the way of clout. Butit can offer exposure, both in shelf space in the store and via thepublicity it has generated.   It also offers professional evaluation from its board ofengineers and lawyers, distribution leads, contacts with retailersand a sympathetic ear.   The typical inventor usually follows a path like this: He getsan idea, becomes obsessed with it, creates a product and producesit. At that point, the honeymoon is over because he then has tosell it.   ``That's where we come in,'' says Zwolinski. ``We offer them astart in the market. There is no way an inventor can know how goodhis product is without public exposure.''   The store is not very large, but it is located in one ofToronto's most fashionable shopping districts. The store managercan judge customer response to products, even browser response.   Robert Dubeck invented the device for reader-bathers, anobsession that has consumed nine years of his life.   ``No one thought this was going to go,'' says Dubeck. ``Everyonewanted me to give up the dream, just keep working. I was put downby friends and family. They basically said work for a living, don'tcome up with a dream to better yourself.''   The secret is getting the big stores and chains to buy and stockthe item. And, according to Dubeck, buyers in these recessionarytimes are not given to speculating on unproven products.   ``Our main concern is marketing, publicity and distribution,''says Zwolinski. ``We're publishing a distribution catalog inDecember, sending it to 10,000 distributors in Canada and theUnited States.   In it, potential customers will find such items as the LeisureReader for the bathtub; a lapel or blouse pin for holdingeyeglasses; the Bathroom Butler that opens and closes toilet lids;erase protection tabs for computer disks; or the box that createsthose microsecond positive affirmation messages for your TV as ameans of changing behavior.   Some of the stuff, Zwolinski admits, is novelty, such as thefloating toilet bowl posters, but a lot of it is genuinelypractical.   About 40 percent of the inventors represented in the store areAmerican.   ``It's really good working with Americans because they are morerisk- oriented and more willing to take a chance,'' says Zwolinski.</TEXT></DOC>
