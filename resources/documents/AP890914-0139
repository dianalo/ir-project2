Hungarian authorities said they had no plans to stop the exodus,which has prompted East Germans in Poland and Czechoslovakia to seekrefuge in West German embassies in hopes they too will get to goWest.   Poland's Foreign Ministry confirmed that some East Germans wereat the West German Embassy in Warsaw. About 150 East Germans werereported in the West German Embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia.   The Vatican newspaper praised Hungary's move, but apro-Solidarity newspaper in Poland cautioned against Warsawfollowing Hungary's example.   After a brief letup in the refugee flow Wednesday, Austria'sInterior Ministry reported Thursday that 100 East Germans an hourwere arriving en route to West Germany.   West German border officials said more than 700 new refugeesarrived overnight. Aid workers in Budapest, where would-be emigrantsregister before going West, said at least 13,000 people had crossedsince early Monday.   The East Germans are automatically granted citizenship in WestGermany and have been put up in camps and given assistance findinghousing and jobs.   The reform-minded Communist government in Hungary opened itsborder to Austria at midnight Sunday, ending a weeks-long standoffthat began when thousands of East Germans flooded the West GermanEmbassy in Budapest seeking legal emigration.   Many had come to Hungary in May, after the country begandismantling barbed wire and other barriers along its westernmostborder, and had been caught trying to cross to the West illegally.They feared they would be punished if they returned to theirhomeland.   West Germany's ARD television network reported rumors Hungarywould close the border soon, but government spokesman Zsolt Bajnoksaid he knew of no such plans.   Bajnok quoted Foreign Minister Gyula Horn as saying Thursday that``no decision has been made'' on stopping the flow of East Germans.   East Germany accused Hungary of breaking an accord prohibitingunauthorized departures to the West of residents of the Warsaw Pactcountries, and it filed a formal protest.   Hungary's Foreign Ministry said the government let the EastGermans go in accordance with a U.N. human rights accord thatoutweighed its agreement with East Germany.   The ministry, in a statement carried by the official MTI newsagency, also said the 1969 East German-Hungarian accord contained asecret article invalidating the agreement ``if conditions changefundamentally.''   ``The conditions had changed fundamentally'' it said, referringto the influx of East Germans. It indicated the borders would remainopen to East Germans as long as masses of them want to cross.   ``Considering that the causes underlying the decision of theHungarian Peoples' Republic have not changed, the Hungarian partycannot consider rescinding the decision at present,'' it said.   MTI quoted a senior Hungarian Communist official, Maria Ormos, astelling Politburo member Kurt Hager that Hungary opened its bordersbecause ``it was unable to cope with the thousands of East Germancitizens.''   Emotions in East Berlin appeared to cool Thursday, with theCommunist Party daily Neues Deutschland refraining from criticism ofHungary for the first time since the refugee flood began.   But several East Germans in Budapest said their countrymen athome feared the East German leadership was planning to crack down ontravel to Hungary, which has been relatively unrestricted.   ``I know four people who are weighing whether to apply forvisas,'' said a woman in her 30s from Dresden. ``But they're scaredthat even applying could get them into trouble.''   Many of those fleeing have said they're doing so out offrustration with political rigidity and repression. Others haveexpressed hopes of earning a better living in West Germany.   East Germans reportedly began arriving at the West German Embassyin Poland several weeks ago.   One 9-year-old boy interviewed on Polish television said therewere about 60 people housed inside a large room of the embassy.Laundry could be seen hanging in the embassy yard, and several youngmen lounged and read in the embassy courtyard. One raised hisfingers in a ``V'' for victory sign.   Ministry spokesman Stefan Staniszewski said Thursday officialshoped to resolve the problem ``in a few days.''   The pro-Solidarity daily Gazeta Wyborcza said that because Polandis a much bigger country and is in a more difficult geopoliticalsituation than Hungary, it should be cautious.   ``Hungary's attitude may evoke sympathy, but as a state we shouldnot follow their example or even praise them loudly,'' thecommentary said.   Poland is bordered by Communist East Germany, Czechoslovakia andthe Soviet Union, while Hungary shares a border with neutral Austria.   The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano said Hungary hadrecently introduced political and social reforms that were inspiredby ``the demands of the fundamental rights of man and by theinalienable dignity of the human person.''</TEXT></DOC>
