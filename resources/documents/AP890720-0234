Chief sponsor Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., said Wednesday thatmany recipients of Social Security Disability Insurance currentlyavoid returning to work because they lose their benefits, includingMedicare coverage, if they earn more than $300 a month after a trialwork period.   Under the legislation, disabled people who returned to work wouldremain eligible for Medicare, and some would pay for the coverage ona sliding fee scale linked to their earnings. Currently, Medicare isunavailable to these individuals at any price.   ``Those people who want to work should have the opportunity to doso,'' Riegle said. ``A disabled person should not be punished bytaking away much needed medical benefits.''   The legislation, whose chief co-sponsor is Senate Minority LeaderBob Dole of Kansas, would cover about 4 million disabled workersnationwide. A similar bill has been introduced in the House by Rep.Steve Bartlett, R-Texas.   Costs of the Senate legislation have been estimated at $120million over five years, but that does not take into effect thecontributions to the economy that would be made by those who wentback to work.   The bill is a followup to legislation enacted last session thatextended similar work incentives to recipients of SupplementalSecurity Income, a separate program that provides a minimal incomefloor to the nation's aged, disabled and blind.</TEXT></DOC>
