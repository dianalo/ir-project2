The anticipated objective is the operationof the new anode under conditions which will prove the validity and indicatethe magnitude of energy saving possible.Eligibility: Based on receipt of an unsolicited application, eligibilityof this award is being limited to ETC, a private corporation with highqualifications in this specialized field of technology. The President ofETC, Dr. Theodore R. Beck, is the inventor, principal investigator andthe patent holder of the modified anode design. ETC will subcontract workto Brooks Rand, Ltd., a private company which specializes in chemical processdevelopment and has the facilities required for the pilot scale development.Mr. Richard Brooks, President of Brooks Rand, Ltd., has more than 30 patentsin chemical process technology and has jointly, with Dr. Beck, made engineeringand economic studies on this new anode technology. It has been determinedthat this project has high technical merit, representing an innovativeand novel idea which has a strong possibility of allowing for future reductionsin the nation's energy consumption.The term of this grant shall be two years from the effective date of award.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>for further information contact:</T2> U.S. Department of Energy, Officeof Procurement Operations, Attn: Lisa Tillman, MA-453.2, 1000 IndependenceAvenue SW., Washington, DC 20585.<ITAG tagnum="6">Scott Sheffield,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Director, Contract Operations Division ``B'', Office of ProcurementOperations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-3676 Filed 2-15-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
