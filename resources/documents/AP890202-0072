The environmental group said its ship, the Gondwana, was steamingtoward a U.S. base on Antarctica's McMurdo Sound, which it claims isheavily polluted.   ``We have finally finished our project here,'' said spokesmanPaul Bogart, interviewed by radio telephone aboard the Gondwana.``We spent 90 minutes flying over the factory ship and three catcherboats, lowering the packages as a parting gift.''   Bogart said the note attached to the cookies dropped byhelicopter read: ``We bear no animosity to the Japanese people ormembers of the Japanese ships.''   He said Greenpeace informed the Japanese skipper of Kyo Maru No.1, the factory ship, that the environmental organization filmed andphotographed the harpooning and electrocution of minke whales duringthe past week.   Japan says it plans to take 300 whales this year as part of itsscientific research to determine the size of whale stocks _ despitea moratorium imposed by the International Whaling Commission.Greenpeace contends most of the whale meat will end up in sushirestaurants in Japan.   Bogart said the Greenpeace helicopter dropped a box of cookiesfor each crew member with an attached note saying: ``If you want toeat whales, eat these.''   He said one of the Japanese catcher boats then relayed a messagethanking the group for the package.   Japanese whaling officials in Tokyo have accused Greenpeace ofengaging in terrorist tactics and endangering lives.   Greenpeace said its presence temporarily halted the hunt and drewinternational attention to the plight of whales.   The group estimated the Japanese had harpooned 55 minke whales.   In Wellington, New Zealand, Greenpeace supporters inblood-spattered overalls today delivered bags of imitation whalemeat to the Japanese Embassy and cultural center to protest thewhale kill.</TEXT></DOC>
