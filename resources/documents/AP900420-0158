He said Bush should not have sent Brent Scowcroft, his nationalsecurity adviser, to Beijing after the suppression of pro-democracyforces in Tiananmen Square last June. Lord also said the presidentshould not have relaxed sanctions against China.   Lord, who was U.S. ambassador to China from 1985 until justbefore troops attacked protesting students, said Bush isdisappointed his overtures to Beijing were not reciprocated.   ``I don't think anyone would claim that they've achievedanything,'' Lord said.   The long-time China scholar made his remarks in an interview onthe PBS-TV program ``American Interests.'' It will be aired inWashington on Saturday.   ``First of all, I think we should keep contact,'' Lord said.``But I think it should be a working-like relationship as long asthey are crushing the Chinese people.''   He said it ``shouldn't include high-level emissaries going toBeijing.''   Lord's stand puts him at odds not only with Bush but with formerPresident Richard M. Nixon and former Secretary of State Henry A.Kissinger, both of whom support strong U.S. ties to China despitethe Beijing government's actions.   Nixon has warned that if the United States withdraws from aclose association with China ``it leaves the field to the SovietUnion and Japan.''   Lord, who held a key State Department post in the Nixonadministration and accompanied Kissinger on his trips to China inthe 1970s, disagreed.   ``He's just wrong on this,'' Lord said.   ``There is no way the Chinese and the Soviets are going to getvery close together,'' he said. ``You have geopolitical disputes.You have ethnic populations across a disputed boundary. You've gotcompetition around the world.''   Japan's occupation of China in World War II has left ``realscars'' even a half-century later, Lord said.   ``Those are not going away and China will always want us in Asiato balance off Japan and the Soviet Union,'' he said.   Lord did not propose Bush break ties with China. And, he said,the president acted in good faith in twice sending Scowcroft toBeijing.   ``He knew the Scowcroft missions would be unpopular at home,''Lord said. ``He tried to break the logjam in China.''   Lord said U.S. policy should be to maintain contact with Beijingbut it should be ``a cool, working type relationship, and not onefilled with tawdry symbolism and high-level contacts and unilateralgestures.''</TEXT></DOC>
