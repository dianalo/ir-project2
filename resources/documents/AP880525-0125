Superpower wrangling over President Reagan'sprized space-based missile defense is being viewed as the majorstumbling block in negotiations to cut U.S. and Soviet long-rangenuclear arsenals by up to 50 percent.   Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev had hoped to signthe treaty at their Moscow summit, beginning Sunday.   The strategic arms reduction treaty would have slashed U.S. andSoviet strategic nuclear arsenals by 30 to 50 percent _ by far themost radical achievement in the roller coaster history of armscontrol.   There are still unresolved problems about verification. How, forexample, could U.S. monitors be sure the Soviets were not illegallyhiding missiles, especially those that are hard to track? Mobilemissiles are in this elusive category. So are cruise missilescarried by planes and warships.   Still, the Strategic Defense Initiative _ popularly called StarWars _ and Soviet attempts to constrain it, turned out to be themain treaty spoiler.   The program, launched by Reagan five years ago, is amulti-billion-dollar search for ways to use lasers, kinetic energyor other futuristic technology to destroy Soviet ballistic missilesas they hurtle through space toward their targets.   Reagan and his supporters see the space defense program as anatural complement to nuclear weapons reductions. They want toreduce offensive arms and also improve defenses so the weaponsremaining in the Soviet strategic arsenal have less of a chance ofgetting through.   Besides, they are convinced that the Soviets, while protestingStar Wars, are quietly engaged in their own space defense program.   At the last superpower summit, in Washington in December, theSoviets proposed that the two sides agree to abide by the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty ``as signed and ratified.''   The accord limited anti-missile defenses on the theory that apotential aggressor would hesitate to launch an attack if his weakdefense exposed his own country to devastating retaliation.   The United States countered, proposing language to allowspace-based testing of Star Wars technology ``as required.''   At the windup, the two sides agreed on an ambiguous statementthat included ``as signed'' from the Soviet proposal and ``asrequired'' from the U.S. side. It did not settle the dispute overthe future of Star wars.   During negotiations this year in Geneva, the Soviets proposedattaching to the START a protocol to limit space defense tests anddemanded the right to stop cutting back their missiles if theyconcluded the U.S. program violated the 1972 ABM treaty. However,the U.S. side refused.   Instead, the United States proposed that the Soviets explicitlyaccept a broad interpretation of the 1972 treaty _ one that wouldgive the current administration and succeeding ones a lot ofrunning room to experiment in space. The net result was deadlock.   Referring to the Star Wars dispute and the verificationproblems, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said earlier thismonth, ``It's now clear there is no way these questions can beshaped up in treaty form in time for the summit.''   So when Reagan meets Gorbachev in Moscow they will have notreaty to sign.   All that will be ready for them to approve is a single provisiondesigned to ease tensions. It is a pledge for each side to notifythe other before any missile test launchings.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Barry Schweid, who covers arms control issuesfor The Associated Press, will be reporting from Moscow during theReagan-Gorbachev summit.</TEXT></DOC>
