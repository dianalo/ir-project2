Mario Biaggiof extorting more than $3 million in cash and stock from WedtechCorp. in exchange for using his political clout to gain governmentcontracts for the company.   The verdict against the 10-term Democrat came on the fifth dayof deliberations in the trial. Four others also were convicted ofracketeering.   The Bronx congressman and six co-defendants at the four-monthtrial were accused of turning Wedtech into a racketeeringenterprise that dispensed millions in bribes to win no-bidcontracts set aside for minority-owned businesses.   The jury rejected arguments that Wedtech did not need theDemocratic lawmaker because the Bronx defense contractor hadfriends in the Reagan White House, including Attorney General EdwinMeese III. Meese has not been charged with wrongdoing in thescandal.   Biaggi, 70, was convicted of all but one of 16 counts, includingconspiracy, extortion, tax evasion and receiving bribes. He facesup to 20 years in prison on the racketeering counts, the mostserious charges. No sentencing date was set.   The jury found the former hero police officer guilty ofextorting $50,000 in cash and stock once worth more than $3 millionand filing false financial disclosure statements and income taxreturns to cover up his illegal profits.   Biaggi removed his glasses, rubbed his eyes and shook his head,then stared ahead, his hands folded atop his cane, as the verdictwas read.   The congressman was sentenced in an unrelated case in Novemberto 2{ years in jail for accepting an illegal gratuity and is freeon appeal.   The jury today also convicted former Bronx Borough PresidentStanley Simon, Wedtech Corp. founder John Mariotta, former SmallBusiness Administration official Peter Neglia and Biaggi's formerlaw partner, Bernard Ehrlich, all of racketeering.   In addition, the jury announced that Richard Biaggi, thecongressman's eldest son, was convicted of racketeering andconspiracy. But a prosecutor informed the judge that the jury hadfound that the younger Biaggi had committed only a singleracketeering act, and at least two are needed to sustain aracketeering conviction.   U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley ruled that theyounger Biaggi had been acquitted of racketeering and conspiracybut was convicted of two lesser counts.   Acquitted of racketeering was Ronald Betso, a former citypoliceman and friend of Neglia's.   After the younger Biaggi was cleared of the racketeering counts,he walked across the courtroom and hugged and kissed his father.   The trial, which began March 11, generated nearly 20,000 pagesof transcripts.   More than 130 witnesses were called, including four formerWedtech executives who testified for the government in exchange forleniency. The four admitted bribing public officials, defraudingthe government and stealing from the company _ in concert withMariotta.   At the heart of the Wedtech case was how Welbilt Electronic DieCorp., a tiny Bronx machine shop started by Mariotta, grew intoWedtech Corp., a multimillion-dollar defense contractor withfriends in high places.   Mariotta, a semi-literate tool and die maker of Hispanicdescent, was once hailed as a ``hero for the '80s'' by PresidentReagan for hiring ex-convicts and former drug addicts in one ofAmerica's most depressed areas.   Prosecutors charged that Mariotta and other Wedtech officialspaid bribes in cash, political contributions, stock or stockoptions to Biaggi, Simon and Neglia for their assistance with cityand federal agencies.   Ehrlich, the younger Biaggi and Betso were accused of helpingthe others either receive or cover up the payoffs.   The defense argued that the corrupt Wedtech executives had pullwith White House insiders like Meese and thus did not need to bribeBiaggi. However, Motley denied a defense request to call Meese as awitness.   Prosecutors claimed the ``Meese defense'' was a smokescreen todivert attention from the defendants.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward J. Little stunned the courtroomduring closing arguments when he called Meese ``a sleaze'' butinsisted that any wrongdoing by the attorney general _ Little'sboss _ had nothing to do with the Biaggi case.   A special prosecutor in Washington has determined there wasinsufficient evidence to charge Meese with any wrongdoing, but hequestioned the attorney general's ethics on several issues.   Biaggi did not take the stand after the judge gave prosecutorslatitude to cross-examine him about his conviction for obstructionand accepting an illegal gratuity. He was sentenced in November to2{ years in jail and fined $500,000.   That conviction was upheld this week by a federal appeals court.   The House Ethics Committee staff recommended in February thatBiaggi be expelled for the earlier conviction, but decided to putoff action on the matter until Biaggi was available to defendhimself.</TEXT></DOC>
