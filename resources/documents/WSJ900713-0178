Researchers at Johns Hopkins University medical school inBaltimore and T Cell Sciences Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.,reported that they used the new protein in rats to limit thedamage from heart attacks, and suggested that the proteincould do the same in humans.</LP><TEXT>   The research, which is being funded by SmithKline BeechamPLC, also could lead to new therapies for arthritis and otherinflammatory diseases, the scientists suggested in theirreport in this week's issue of Science. The report is anelaboration of experiments briefly described by theresearchers last fall at the annual meeting of the AmericanHeart Association.   The research involves a new way to block the action of apart of the immune system known as the &quot;complement system.&quot;This is a collection of proteins that are activated when thebody is invaded by bacteria, fungi, viruses or other foreignsubstances. Among other actions, the complement proteinsactivate certain special blood cells to rush to an injuredarea to clean up the debris left after the assault on, say, abacterium.   One adverse side effect of activating these specializedblood cells is that the cells can inadvertently trigger aninflammation of normal tissues. This is believed to be thecause of some inflammatory diseases such as certain types ofarthritis, and of disorders involving inflammation of theblood vessels (vasculitis), the kidneys (glomerulonephritis)and muscles (myasenthia gravis).   Douglas T. Fearon and his colleagues at Johns Hopkinsreported that they had pinpointed one of the complementproteins that can be used to block the complement system --preventing, they hope, or at least damping the damaginginflammatory response. The blocking protein engineered by TCell Sciences is a shortened version of a natural humanprotein called complement receptor one (CR1).   In its first animal test, the engineered CR1 proteinsuccessfully limited the damage of a heart attack in rats. Inthis test, Dr. Fearon teamed up with Myron R. Weisfeldt andhis colleagues at Johns Hopkins who have been exploring aphenomenon called &quot;reperfusion injury.&quot;   In a heart attack, the initial damage to the heart muscleis caused by a sudden blockage of blood flow by a blood clot.Dr. Weisfeldt and others believe that additional damage tothe heart muscle occurs when blood flow is restored, ashappens when the new clot-dissolving drugs are used to getrid of the blocking clot. This additional damage --reperfusion injury -- is thought to be caused bycomplement-activated blood cells that rush into the damagedarea with the restored flow.   In the rat experiment, blood flow to part of the heartmuscle was temporarily stopped to simulate a heart attack andthen restored. In the animals treated with the engineeredCR1, the area of damage in the heart muscle was more than 30%smaller than in animals that had &quot;heart attacks&quot; but weren'ttreated with the protein, the researchers reported.   In a second experiment, far fewer complement-activatedcells were found in the damaged area of the hearts ofCR1-treated rats than in untreated rats, indicating theprotein was, indeed, limiting heart damage by blocking thecomplement system.   At T Cell Sciences, Scientific Director Patrick Kung saidthe company had licensed rights to the proteins from JohnsHopkins and from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston,where Dr. Fearon began his research. Mr. Kung said thebiotechnology company hopes to begin trials of the CR1protein in human heart-attack patients late next year.   SmithKline Beecham, the big Anglo-American drug company,is providing $10 million to $12 million to T Cell Sciencesfor the preclinical studies of the complement-blockingproteins and will fund human testing of the protein in returnfor world-wide marketing rights.</TEXT></DOC>
