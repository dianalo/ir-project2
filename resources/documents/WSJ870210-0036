Wilkis, a former investment banker who is a major figure in the Dennis B. Levine insider-trading scandal, was sentenced to a year and a day in prison.    Mr. Wilkis, whose cooperation played an important role in the government's insider-trading case against financier Ivan F. Boesky, also was sentenced to five years' probation.    In passing sentence on the former investment banker at Lazard Freres andamp; Co. and E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., Federal District Judge Peter Leisure referred several times to Mr. Wilkis's &quot;important corroboration&quot; of evidence that led to guilty pleas by other participants in the insider trading conspiracy. And he noted that Mr. Wilkis is continuing to provide government investigators with additional information about &quot;insider trading in the financial community&quot; that could lead to prosecutions of other still-undisclosed investment bankers.    Of Mr. Levine's co-conspirators sentenced thus far, Mr. Wilkis, 37 years old, played the most important role. Mr. Wilkis earlier pleaded guilty to four felony charges for his part in the scheme, in which he exchanged confidential information about numerous takeover targets and other transactions with Mr. Levine and reaped about $3 million from illicit insider trading.    Mr. Wilkis wept periodically during the sentencing. In a voice breaking with emotion, he told the judge that &quot;I can't begin to tell you how ashamed I am for my terrible offense.&quot; He said he is &quot;distraught&quot; over the suffering he has caused his family, friends and colleagues.    Mr. Wilkis's lawyer, Gary Naftalis, described his client as a young man who had a history of emotional and psychiatric problems. He told the judge that Mr. Wilkis had dropped out of Harvard College for a year and underwent electroshock therapy for manic depression, and said Mr. Wilkis has occasionally been suicidal since the onset of the government's insider-trading investigation.    Mr. Naftalis also said that just before Mr. Levine's arrest, Mr. Levine was actively cooperating with the government to obtain incriminating evidence against others in the conspiracy. Mr. Naftalis said that Mr. Levine made a secret tape recording of a conversation in which Mr. Wilkis, at Mr. Levine's request, agreed to protect Mr. Levine by not cooperating in the government's investigation. This was further evidence, Mr. Naftalis said, of the spell Mr. Levine had cast over Mr. Wilkis.    Judge Leisure said he was willing to accept that Mr. Wilkis was recruited by Mr. Levine through &quot;extraordinary personal charm and magnetism and a keen ability to exploit others' insecurities.&quot;    Judge Leisure noted that Mr. Levine told Mr. Wilkis that &quot;all successful investment bankers on Wall Street have bank accounts abroad&quot; and &quot;traded on inside information.&quot; But Judge Leisure said he personally knows investment bankers for whom such a scheme would be &quot;repugnant to everything they stand for.&quot;    Judge Leisure said a prison sentence was necessary as both punishment and a deterrent. But he imposed no fine, noting that Mr. Wilkis had already turned over nearly all his assets, totaling more than $3 million, to an escrow account to satisfy civil claims and penalties, including taxes due of $1.3 million. The judge said Mr. Wilkis's family &quot;shouldn't be punished further.&quot;    Mr. Levine has pleaded guilty to four felony charges for his role in the Levine and Boesky scheme, the largest insider-trading scandal ever. Mr. Levine, in turn, implicated Mr. Boesky, who has paid $100 million to settle insider-trading charges, agreed to plead guilty to a felony count and cooperate in the government's continuing investigation. As reported, Mr. Wilkis was a potential corroborating witness for Mr. Levine had Mr. Boesky fought government charges in court.    Mr. Wilkis could have been sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in prison and fines totaling $850,000.    Mr. Wilkis is the fourth of the Levine co-conspirators to be sentenced. Mr. Levine is scheduled to be sentenced later this month, and a former Lazard Freres analyst, Randall Cecola, is scheduled to be sentenced this afternoon. </TEXT></DOC>
