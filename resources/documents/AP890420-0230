Committee Chairman John Geldermann said the urgency ofWednesday's recommendations was necessary to maintain investorconfidence since disclosure three months ago of a federalinvestigation into suspected fraud at the Merc and the ChicagoBoard of Trade.   Dual trading, allowed by virtually every financial exchange,enables a trader to trade his own account at the same time hehandles customers' accounts.   Many consider the practice susceptible to abuse because itallows unscrupulous traders to allocate profitable deals to theirown accounts and dump losing trades on customers.   Proponents of dual trading argue that the practice increasesliquidity because traders can continue doing business when theydon't have outside orders.   But the Merc committee, with few exceptions, recommended thatdual trading be banned from futures contracts in cases where marketvolume is great enough to ensure liquidity.   The committee also recommended:   _More extensive screening of membership applicants.   _That members of a broker association should not be allowed toexecute personal trades against orders by members of the brokergroup.   _The addition of one non-Merc member to all major disciplinarycommittees. ``The criticism is that we're too clubby,'' said Mercpolicy chief Leo Melamed. ``This would enable the public to viewthe process and see we are open-handed.''   _Daily computerized trade information for members covering allactivity from the previous day.   The panel also recommended the Merc's full-time floorsurveillance team be doubled to eight staff members.   The recommendations will be submitted to the Merc's board ofgovernors, and a decision is expected within 60 days.   ``The outside members of the committee felt that the ChicagoMercantile Exchange has acted in good faith in enforcing itsexisting rules and procedures, and tightening them whennecessary,'' said Ms. Phillips, a vice president at the Universityof Iowa.   ``But the rules and procedures have not kept pace with the rapidexpansion of new products and trading volume during the past fewyears,'' she said.   Melamed said many of the recommendations contained in the reportwere under consideration earlier.   ``But the time frame was compressed as a result of the (federal)investigation,'' he said.   Merc officials appointed the nine-member committee in lateJanuary.   Some observers viewed the committee as part of the futuresindustry's effort to hold the line against further governmentregulations.   The FBI investigation centers on allegations that as many as 100brokers at the world's two largest futures exchanges may havesystematically cheated investors out of millions of dollars throughillegal trading practices.   No indictments have been handed down yet, but as many as 200subpeonas reportedly have been issued to traders and firms at theexchanges. Published reports have said FBI agents posing as tradersat the Merc and Board of Trade secretly recorded conversations inthe pits.</TEXT></DOC>
