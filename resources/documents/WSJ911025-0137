The measures, which differ on some details, are intendedto tackle one of the biggest obstacles to health-care accessin the U.S.: the lack of affordable health policies forsmall-business employers. The legislation would cost around$10 billion over the first five years, but neither chairmanoffered any suggestions on how to pay for it.</LP><TEXT>   If a small company has even one employee with a serioushealth problem, insurers often refuse to write a policy forthat company, or they charge so much that the company can'tafford it. In addition, employees with health conditions whodo have employer-provided health insurance are often afraidto change jobs for fear of losing coverage.   The companion bills, offered by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D.,Texas) and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), seek to remedythis by outlawing discrimination based on the medical statusof beneficiaries in small group plans. The bills also limitthe amount that premiums can vary among small group plans.And they require a standard benefit package that must beoffered to all groups of between two and 50 employees. Thebills also allow self-employed people to deduct from incometaxes the full cost of buying health insurance. And the billswould extend Medicare, the health insurance program for theelderly and disabled, to cover a variety of preventive healthservices.   Both Mr. Bentsen, chairman of the Senate FinanceCommittee, and Mr. Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Waysand Means Committee, support overhauling the entire U.S.health-care system. Mr. Rostenkowski has introduced a billthat would require all employers to either provide healthinsurance to their employees, or pay a tax to finance apublic plan.   But both men believe enactment of a comprehensivehealth-care plan is a long way off, and say they are offeringthis more limited measure to address an important element ofthe health-care problem now.</TEXT></DOC>
