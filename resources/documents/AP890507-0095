The aircraft maker based here and South African TransportMinister Eli Louw in Johannesburg said in separate announcementsSaturday South African Airways would buy two Boeing 747-400 jetsfor $256 million. The planes are to be delivered in November 1990and May 1991.   The government-owned airline also has options for two moreaircraft, which would be delivered in 1992 for another $256 million.   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., is ``violently opposed to the sale,''said spokeswoman Barbara Smith. ``He finds it very inappropriate.''   House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash., said in Spokane hethinks Boeing officials know there are strong feelings in theUnited States and Seattle about South Africa's system of apartheid,or racial segregation.   Foley said he had a ``forthright talk'' with Boeing CommercialAirplanes President Dean Thornton, who told him that ``Boeing has alongstanding policy to sell its planes without regard to foreignpolicy as long as the sale is legal.''   U.S. policies do not prohibit such sales to South Africa. Boeingshareholders recently voted down a stockholder-proposed measurethat would have prohibited doing business with South Africa.   Boeing has no office, employees or investments in South Africa,said Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Dick Schleh.   ``The Boeing Company markets to airlines throughout the world solong as they're countries the U.S. government permits sales to bemade in,'' Schleh said. ``When it comes to the question of whetheraircraft should be sold in a particular country, it's a decisionbest made by the U.S. government.''   Rep. Jim McDermott, a Democrat whose district includes Boeing,opposes the sale and is a sponsor of a resolution to increase tradesanctions against South Africa.   Mike Williams, McDermott's staff director, said Friday thatBoeing told McDermott earlier in the week that a sale was beingnegotiated.   ``I've come back to Seattle to try to meet with them and seewhat's going on and why,'' Williams said. ``RepresentativeMcDermott has expressed in no uncertain terms that he is opposed tothe sale.''   ``At this point there is no specific violation of the 1986Anti-apartheid Act because it appears to be a commercial sale,''said Ms. Smith, Sen. Adams' spokeswoman. ``But that does not excusethe Boeing Company from taking an insensitive position.''   The Anti-apartheid Act prohibits the sale of some technology toSouth Africa that could be used by the government or military.   ``This is considered a commercial transaction,'' Schleh said.   Boeing has sold 53 airliners to South African Airways. The lastone was delivered in 1983.</TEXT></DOC>
