Asked by reporters if he backed the changes, Treasury Secretary James Baker said: &quot;No. We support only the tax increases that are in our budget.&quot;    The gas-guzzler tax boost has been approved by the Senate Finance Committee, while the corporate tax change has been suggested by Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), the committee's chairman. The gas-guzzler tax would increase, by $500 to almost $4,000, the cost of purchasing expensive, foreign-made cars that fail to meet the federal fuel-efficiency standard of 22.5 miles a gallon.    Sen. Bentsen's proposal would undo the effect of a temporary tax benefit that corporations sometimes get when they switch methods of figuring estimated tax payments.    The two measures are designed to help pay for the so-called taxpayer bill of rights, which would give taxpayers greater protection in disputes with the IRS, and for a measure that would relieve farmers and others of the need to pay taxes for diesel fuel used off the road. The tax doesn't apply to off-road use, but the 1986 tax bill required farmers and others to pay it, anyway, and then seek a refund. </TEXT></DOC>
