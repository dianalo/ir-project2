(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former PTL leader Jim Bakker received atwo-day extension today on a deadline to produce a $3 million lineof credit supporting his bid to regain control of the televisionministry and religious theme park.   At a news conference this afternoon outside the Heritage USApark offices, bankruptcy court trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton said hegave Bakker until Thursday to prove he has the money to regain theempire he lost in a sex-and-money scandal.   Benton, who had set today as the deadline, said the reason forthe delay was that attorneys were still working out final detailsof the contract for Bakker to buy PTL.   Benton said he was convinced that Bakker had the $3 million butsaid the contract would not be completed until Wednesday at theearliest.   A jubilant Bakker told reporters he expected to have the $3million by the end of the day.   Benton said Bakker's total bid now is $172 million, up from the$165 million that had been reported, and that Bakker needs topresent him with a bonafide plan for $74 million of the financingby Friday.   Bakker's bid is scheduled to be presented to U.S. BankruptcyJudge Rufus Reynolds on Saturday. Benton said he would not rule outthe possibility that other offers also would be presented to thejudge.   Bakker said he has $2.9 million in cash and pledges already, andexpects to top $3 million by the end of the day.   ``It looks like it's all going to be there,'' Bakker saidearlier today about the $3 million line of credit.   Meeting with reporters at the World Outreach Center executiveoffices of PTL, he acknowledged he did not have the entire amountyet, saying, ``We might be $100,000 or $200,000 short.''   Asked when he expected to have it all, he said, ``By midnighttonight.''   Bakker said he spent the morning at the Jim and Tammy Ministriesoffice answering telephones.   Bakker and his attorney, Jim Toms, said Monday they were certainsupporters will donate the money needed to satisfy PTL bankruptcytrustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton.   ``To come up with $3 million in a holiday weekend I had to prayand say, `God help me,''' Bakker said.   ``We are sort of running our own Labor Day telethon without atelevision station,'' he said. ``I'm not going to leave any stoneunturned. I'm not going to stumble now.''   Bakker said a group of people was working on raising theremaining $1 million in $1,000 pledges and he has set up a trustaccount at a Hendersonville, N.C., bank to accept donations. Thosedonations would be used only if he and his wife, Tammy Faye,succeeded in purchasing the ministry, he said.   Benton asked for the money as a sign of Bakker's ability tofollow through on his offer for the Heritage USA Christian themepark, a satellite TV network and undeveloped property near the FortMill ministry.   Bakker leads the bidding for the assets of the ministry thatwent into bankruptcy protection soon after he left in March 1987.Bakker stepped down after admitting to a sexual encounter withchurch secretary Jessica Hahn and after the ministry paid her hushmoney.</TEXT></DOC>
