They may be carryingasbestos, a state health official says.   When a German student at the University of Oklahoma returnedfrom a holiday trip to his homeland with two small pieces of thewall, his host family saw what they believed was asbestos on one ofthe chunks.   They took it to the department where tests showed about 75percent of it was filled with chrysotile-asbestos, said John Feero,laboratory supervisor of the department's asbestos program.   Chrysotile-asbestos was commonly used in building materials,Feero said.   Whether the entire Berlin Wall contains the cancer-causingsubstance is unknown. The asbestos material could be isolated tojust the piece examined by state officials, Feero said.   He said the risk of harm is slight, but any piece of the wallwith asbestos should be kept in a sealed container.   ``The danger is minuscule but it's still not something thatshould be transported all over the place without properprecautions,'' Feero said ``You probably wouldn't want it sittingin the open.''   In the piece examined by state officials, the asbestos fiberswere imbedded in the matrix, he said. Only by chipping, crushing orbreaking it would those fibers be released into the air, Feero said.</TEXT></DOC>
