The Richmond, Va.-based transportation and natural resources company told analysts here that its plan, announced late last Friday, would improve pretax operating results by $200 million a year when fully implemented. CSX said it expects to realize the bulk of the savings by the end of 1990. The $778 million charge includes a provision of $592 million to pay some 8,200 railroad employees to leave the company and a provision of $186 million for anticipated litigation claims related to other matters.    John Snow, president of CSX, said the latest labor-separation plan would take considerably longer to implement and would lack the extensive changes in railroad work rules contained in a previous plan. That initial plan proposed to cut CSX's railroad work force by more than 10,000, or about 25%, and give remaining rail employees bonuses tied to productivity gains.    Last May the United Transportation Union voted against participating in that gain-sharing program, which included widespread changes in railroad work rules.    &quot;We thought there was a lot of merit in gain-sharing,&quot; said Mr. Snow. &quot;But when we didn't accomplish gain-sharing, we moved onto other things.&quot; Mr. Snow said the new plan would rely primarily on voluntary responses of employees who agree to leave the company.    Some analysts expressed skepticism, suggesting that entrenched work rules may prevent CSX from severing the number of employees targeted. But Graeme Lidgerwood, an analyst at First Boston Corp., said the latest plan caused her to change her rating of CSX stock to a buy from a hold.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, CSX closed at $28.50, up $1.75.    The failure of CSX's gain-sharing plan to win the full support of rail labor shows how difficult it is to make swift and widespread changes in railroad work practices. &quot;CSX was trying to do something that was striking, highly innovative,&quot; said Jeffrey Stone, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co. &quot;Now CSX has had to fall back to offering conventional but very lucrative severance payments to employees deemed to be surplus.&quot;    Under the new plan CSX would offer payments of between $30,000 and $50,000 for most categories of railroad workers, with locomotive engineers entitled to separation payments of $75,000. CSX said the plan would eventually reduce the number of workers it uses to operate some freight trains. That's because CSX currently has agreements with its unions that would allow the carrier to reduce the number of crew members in places where there aren't furloughed employees to fill the jobs.    CSX's original gain-sharing proposal included &quot;work rule changes that were very substantial, very severe and very difficult for us to accept,&quot; said Robert Hart, general counsel of the United Transportation Union. But Mr. Hart said the union won't object if railroad workers accept voluntary buy-outs. &quot;If people want to sell their jobs, we're not going to make them work,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
