John Paul has made the dignity of work and the need for jobs apersistent theme of his 10-year papacy and one which figuredprominently in his speeches in Metz and Nancy on the third day ofhis four-day visit to the Alsace-Lorraine region.   The pope also announced he was sending a letter of encouragementto inmates in French jails.   In Strasbourg, a shouting match broke out during the openingsession of the European Parliament over the speech the pope wasscheduled to deliver Tuesday. Niall Andrews, an Irish Catholicconservative, accused the Rev. Ian Paisley of planning to disruptthe speech.   He called Paisley, another parliamentarian and leader of thehard-line Irish Protestant Democratic Unionist Party, ``aninstitutional terrorist.'' Paisley shouted back that he opposedboth the pope and the Roman Catholic Church and that he planned toexpress his opposition during the pontiff's address.   In Nancy, John Paul told more than 40,000 faithful jammed into asquare that economic and social problems should not blind them tothe presence of God in the world.   ``Certain human hopes seem to be sinking,'' said the 68-year-oldpontiff, wearing a bright red cape and speaking under a white,cone-shaped canopy.   He said mines and heavy industries that once flourished are indecline, and demanded that ``a whole new economic restructuring beinvented and put in place'' to solve the unemployment dilemma.   ``If faith does not dictate ready-made answers, it does providethe courage to undertake the search, to seek the appropriate typeof development. ... It suggests that human work be re-evaluated inaccordance with the dignity of the person.''   Although Alsace-Lorraine reports an unemployment rate onlyslightly higher than the national average of 10.5 percent, thejobless rate in industrial cities of the region is higher. Thedecline in heavy industry and mining has particularly hurtimmigrants who came in waves from elsewhere in Europe and NorthAfrica during the industrial boom years of the 1960s and 1970s andmake up nearly 10 percent of the population of Metz and thesurrounding area.   The pope complimented the region for welcoming foreigners andcalled on residents to reject the secularizing trends that haveresulted in a sharp drop in French attendance at Mass since WorldWar II.   Ultra-conservative elements of the Roman Catholic Church inFrance have expressed concern about the large number of Moslemimmigrants. Islam, now the second-largest religion in France,arrived with the influx of immigrants from North Africa.   The conservative Catholics were prominent among the suporters ofNational Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, who won 14 percent of thevote in the first round of presidential balloting last spring andcampaigned against immigration.</TEXT></DOC>
