On April 18, for example, a typical article in a British journal suggested that in the preceding year, Treasury Secretary Baker &quot;has taken out balance of payments insurance by persuading foreign central banks to suppress an upsurge of American interest rates by purchasing nearly $200 billion of U.S. securities&quot; (emphasis added). If the central banks ever stopped financing our trade deficit by buying Treasury securities, the experts agreed, then the dollar would drop by 30% and interest rates would soar.    Now, however, foreign central banks are not only not buying dollars, but instead selling billions. Yet the dollar nonetheless remains quite strong, and U.S. bond yields have gone down, not up. If it really required $100 billion to $200 billion of intervention to prop up the dollar, how can things have suddenly changed so much? Much credit for the dollar's firming is given to recent dramatic narrowing of the monthly trade-deficit figures. But in actual dollar terms, that is not the big story.    What has changed in the first half of 1988 appears to be mainly the capital account (investment) rather than the current account (trade). Americans are investing less abroad, leaving fewer foreign transactions to finance by selling dollars, while foreigners are investing more in the U.S., and thus buying dollars to finance those investments. The U.S. is clearly looking relatively more attractive to world investors. Bond prices have recently increased in the U.S., but fallen in Germany, the U.K. and Japan. Stock prices are also near this year's peak in the U.S., but the largest foreign stock markets are well below their peaks when measured in U.S. dollars.    Of course, the dollar's rise and the improved picture for U.S. investments are mutually reinforcing -- it is hard to pinpoint where the chicken-and-egg cycle began. But by itself, the stronger dollar should take some competitive pricing pressure off the industries of countries such as Germany and Japan, thus helping their stocks. So, the fact that their markets nonetheless remain much weaker than those here, when measured in the same currency, indicates that discounted profit opportunities look stronger in the U.S.    The U.S. is not alone. Canada, Australia and, until recently, the United Kingdom all experienced sharp increases in both their currencies and stock markets this year, relative to Continental Europe. Interestingly, Canada and the U.S. both reduced marginal tax rates in January, while Australia announced lower tax rates for the near future. The British pound first soared on the news that the top tax rate would soon drop to 40% from 60%, but there has since been considerable uncertainty about new taxes in both Britain and Germany.    An improved tax climate can improve investment opportunities, and thus attract both foreign and domestic capital. Unless offset by an easier monetary policy, the effect would be at least a temporary appreciation of the currency. At the same time, reasonable monetary restraint is appropriate in the weaker-currency countries, even though a major reason for declining demand for those currencies may well be an uncompetitive tax policy.    Whatever caused private capital to flow back to the U.S., however, the size of that capital inflow could not possibly be large enough to account for the dramatic turnaround in the dollar if central banks had really been intervening last year at the levels claimed. That claim thus merits a second look.    The table, which is condensed from Commerce Department figures, shows that (contrary to prevailing belief) private foreign investors made more than enough investments in the U.S. to finance the &quot;current-account&quot; deficit last year. What foreign investors did not do, however, was invest enough to also offset increased U.S. investment in other countries. While U.S. investors were spending more than $86 billion on foreign securities and direct investments, that, too, required converting dollars into foreign currency, as would an equivalent import of goods.    Why do so many people believe that the actual increase in foreign official reserves was double or quadruple the U.S. government's figure of $47.8 billion? The Treasury would surely notice if $100 billion to $200 billion of its securities were bought by foreign central banks last year, yet recorded foreign purchases of Treasury securities were only $36.7 billion.    The huge estimates of foreign intervention invariably involve rather slippery statistics. For example, the IMF's last Outlook stated, &quot;The increase in the dollar value of the foreign exchange reserves of the Group of Seven countries excluding the United States in 1987 (including non-dollar assets and valuation changes) amounted to $104 billion. This reflected concerted intervention in support of the dollar&quot; (emphasis added). The parenthetical passage is actually crucial. What it means is that increased reserves of currencies other than the dollar are being counted as &quot;intervention in support of the dollar.&quot; This is transparent nonsense, since foreign purchases of Japanese yen and German marks could scarcely have supported the dollar. After all, dollars amount to only two-thirds of official reserves, even aside from gold, and may well have amounted to a much smaller percentage of last year's increase in total world reserves.    Moreover, the IMF's &quot;valuation changes&quot; involve converting the value of all outstanding stocks of non-dollar reserves, such as yen and marks, into dollars. Of course, the dollar value of yen or mark reserves, accumulated over many years, automatically increased when the dollar fell. Such &quot;valuation changes&quot; accounted for about a quarter of the world's increase in reserves -- more than $50 billion.    Since foreign central banks did not really finance much more than a third of the U.S. current-account deficit last year, we can see why seemingly small shifts in private capital flows toward the U.S. can suddenly turn foreign central banks into sellers, rather than buyers, of dollars. We can also see dissolving a central tenet of those who've long argued that the large budget and trade deficits of the Reagan years have left the U.S. economy tottering on the edge of ruin.    Even if the much larger estimates of foreign reserves were plausible, that still would not justify the IMF conclusion that the entire increase in world reserves reflected &quot;intervention in support of the dollar.&quot; Mexico built up large reserves, but that was hardly because it feared appreciation of the peso. Moreover, reserves were added to stabilize some currencies within Europe. The Bank for International Settlements notes that the U.K. was mainly adding to its reserves of German marks, not dollars, while half the increase of Germany's reserves consisted of other European currencies.    Also, as The Economist points out, &quot;governments hold reserves . . . as a cushion against sudden falls in export earnings.&quot; Countries such as Taiwan and Japan had good reasons to be worried about a sudden fall in export earnings, due to trade sanctions and the dollar's previous decline. They also had good reasons to build reserves against a sudden rise in the price of their commodity imports, such as metals, wool and soybeans. Japan and others presumably will run down such desired reserves only if they face the same weak-currency problem that Germany does -- namely, a sharp decline in foreign and domestic willingness to hold their assets. If many countries felt compelled to sell desired dollar reserves in an effort to offset a shift of private capital into U.S. dollars, that could only mean that foreign demand for U.S. stocks and bonds would be strong -- which is the opposite of the capital-flight scenario that so haunts the &quot;twin deficits&quot; lobby.    There is no reason to suppose that German and British efforts to keep their currencies from sinking against the dollar threaten higher U.S. interest rates. If the Fed matched the foreign increase in short-term interest rates, that would probably defeat the purpose, attracting &quot;hot money&quot; into dollars and making the dollar rise. Indeed, the Fed ultimately may have to ease to help support the mark, though the Fed would do so only if non-farm commodity prices &quot;including gold&quot; remain reasonably stable, in dollars. (At the end of June, the Journal of Commerce index of industrial commodity prices was unchanged from a year earlier, while gold and oil were lower).    Inflation is a global phenomenon, with exchange rates merely keeping relative inflation a little lower in countries with relatively strong currencies, like the U.S. dollar. Recent anxiety about U.S. inflation alone has probably been overdone, but monetary tightening by the weaker-currency countries may nonetheless be helpful in holding U.S. interest rates down, not up. That is because reduced concerns about future global inflation would hold down bond yields in all major economies. As for the rising dollar itself, recall that when the dollar dropped in spring 1987, Japanese bond yields plummeted to half their current level (2.5%), as world investors tried to maximize exchange rate gains in what was then the stronger currency, and to avoid exchange losses in the weaker currency. The U.S. may be getting into the same enviable position that Japan was in last spring, or Switzerland a decade before. So long as the U.S. has the stronger currency, it also has the better bonds.    ---   Mr. Reynolds is chief economist at Polyconomics, Morristown, N.J.    ---                   Select U.S. International                     Transactions in 1987                    (In billions of dollars)    To be financed       U.S. current account deficit             $154.0       U.S. investment abroad                   $ 86.3    Main sources of finance       Foreign investment in U.S.*              $185.0       Increase in foreign dollar reserves      $ 47.8    *Assumes a small statistical discrepancy in unrecorded private capital inflows    Source: From Commerce Dept. figures</TEXT></DOC>
