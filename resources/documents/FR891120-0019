These final rules implement the Developmental DisabilitiesAssistance and Bill of Rights Act Amendments of 1987 (Pub.

L.88-164) was enacted to provide for planning activities and constructionof facilities to provide services to the mentally retarded. This legislationwas subsequently amended by the Developmental Disabilities Services andFacilities Construction Amendments of 1970 (Pub. L. 91-517) which constitutedthe first Congressional effort to address the needs of a group of personswith handicaps designated as developmental disabilities. The 1970 Amendmentsdefined developmental disability to include individuals with mental retardation,cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and other neurological conditions closely relatedto mental retardation which originated prior to age 18 and constituteda substantial handicap. It also created State Planning Councils to advocatefor, plan, monitor and evaluate services for persons with developmentaldisabilities; it also authorized grants for constructing, administeringand operating University Affiliated Facilities.The legislation authorizing the Developmental Disabilities program hasbeen revised periodically. The major changes of note included the following:(1) The 1975 Amendments (Pub. L. 94-103) deleted the construction authority,authorized studies to determine the feasibility of having University AffiliatedFacilities establish Satellite Centers, established the Protection andAdvocacy System, and added a section on ``Rights of the DevelopmentallyDisabled;'' (2) the 1978 amendment (Pub. L. 95-602) included a functionaldefinition of developmental disabilities; and (3) the Developmental DisabilitiesAmendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-527) added a new emphasis regarding thepurpose of the program, i.e., to assist States to assure that persons withdevelopmental disabilities receive the care, treatment and other servicesnecessary to enable them to achieve their maximum potential through increasedindependence, productivity, and integration into the community.The 1987 amendments extend authorization of appropriations for programsunder the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act(the Act) through FY 1990, and made other revisions to the Act. The amendmentsrevise definitions of priority activities under State plans; require additionalactivities under State protection and advocacy systems; and require a varietyof new reviews, studies, and reports. They also require the Secretary toconsider applications for four new university affiliated programs or satellitecenters each year through FY 1990.Developmental Disabilities Program<ITAG tagnum="81">Basic State Grants</ITAG>Formula grants are made to States for planning, coordinating, and administeringservices for citizens with developmental disabilities. This program assistsStates in developing and implementing a comprehensive plan to ensure thatpersons with developmental disabilities have the range of services availableto them which best promote self-sufficiency.Protection and AdvocacyFormula grants are made to States for the establishment of a system toprotect and advocate for the rights of persons with developmental disabilities.This system must have the authority to pursue legal, administrative, andother appropriate remedies to ensure the protection of the rights of developmentallydisabled individuals who are receiving, or who are eligible to receive,treatment or habilitation services.University Affiliated ProgramsAwards are made to universities, or public or nonprofit entities associatedwith universities, to establish University Affiliated Programs or SatelliteCenters. Such programs carry out interdisciplinary training, conduct demonstrationsof exemplary services, provide technical assistance, and disseminate informationwhich will assist in improving the service delivery system.Projects of National SignificanceThis program provides funding through grants and contracts for projectsto educate policymakers, develop an ongoing data collection system, determinethe feasibility and desirability of developing a nationwide informationand referral system, and pursue Federal interagency initiatives and otherprojects of national significance which hold promise of expanding or otherwiseimproving opportunities for persons with developmental disabilities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>The Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 7, 1988, (53 FR 49332-49335). Interestedpersons were given sixty days in which to send written comments regardingthe proposed rules. During the sixty (60) day comment period, fifteen (15)letters containing seventeen (17) comments were received.All written comments were analyzed and form the basis for changes whichthe Department has made in these final rules.Part 1385 contains provisions which apply to all of the Developmental Disabilitiesprograms. Part 1386 regulates the two formula grant programs: the BasicState Grant Program for Planning Priority Area Activities for Persons withDevelopmental Disabilities authorized by part B of the Act, and the Protectionand Advocacy (Pandamp;A) program authorized by part C of the Act. Part 1387applies to Projects of National Significance; and part 1388 applies toUniversity Affiliated Programs authorized by part D of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and the Departmental Response</ITAG>The discussion which follows includes a summary of all comments, our responsesto those comments, and a description of the changes that have been madein the final rule as a result of the comments.<ITAG tagnum="76">PART 1385_REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIESPROGRAM</ITAG>Section 1385.9(a) has been amended to add 45 CFR parts 86 and 92 to thelist of references applicable to grants under parts 1386 through 1388.This is a technical and conforming change made by the Department.<ITAG tagnum="72">PART 1386_FORMULA GRANT PROGRAMS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart B_State System for Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights</ITAG>Section1386.23 Periodic Reports: protection and Advocacy SystemSection 1386.23 of the NPRM proposed new language in paragraph (c) whichreiterated current reporting requirements for the submission of financialstatus reports and deleted the specifics regarding the time periods forsubmittal. We proposed that the time period requirements would be providedthrough a Program Instruction rather than through language in rules.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed the view that the rule wouldbe revising current reporting requirements.<T3>Response:</T3> The proposed rule did not revise current reporting requirementsbut deleted from the rule the specifics regarding the time periods forsubmittal. Therefore, no change will be made in andSection; 1386.23(c).<ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart C_State Plan for Provision of Services for Persons With DevelopmentalDisabilities</ITAG>Section 1386.30 State Plan RequirementsSection 1386.30(e)(4) proposed that each State Planning Council shall receivefrom the State administering agency funds to hire staff and obtain theservices of other technical, professional, and clerical staff consistentwith State law.<T3>Comment:</T3> Twelve commenters stated that the proposed language inandSection; 1386.30(e)(4) did not accurately reflect the role and the authorityof the State Planning Council pursuant to section 124(c)(1) of the Actin regard to the hiring of Council staff. The commenters indicated thatthe State Planning Councils, not the designated agency or the State, havethe authority to hire staff as long as it is done in a manner consistentwith State law.<T3>Response:</T3> The Department agrees that State Planning Councils havethe authority to hire staff. Therefore, we have revised the language ofthe final rule to further clarify this fact.Section 1386.33 Protection of Employee's InterestsSection 1386.33 of the NPRM regarding protection of employee's interestswas amended to reflect a new statutory citation.<T3>Comment:</T3> We received three comments regarding employee protectionwhich interpreted this section as containing substantive changes.<T3>Response:</T3> Since this section was revised only to include a newstatutory citation in paragraph (a), we have not made a change in the finalrule.<ITAG tagnum="72">PART 1387_PROJECTS OF NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE</ITAG>Section 1387.1 GeneralRequirementsThe NPRM proposed language for a new paragraph (b) in andSection; 1387.1.The current regulatory language of andSection; 1387.1(c) then became paragraph(d).<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed the view that as all referencesto model demonstrations and direct services have been eliminated by the1987 Amendments, projects funded under this part need not be ``exemplarymodels'' which can be ``replicated,'' and therefore paragraph (d) shouldbe deleted from the rules.<T3>Response:</T3> The Department concurs with the comment that the word``model'' does have a direct service delivery connotation and will deletesuch reference in the rule. However, we believe that projects of nationalsignificance must be exemplary and have potential for replication or otherwiseclearly meet the goals of Part E of the Act. Therefore, paragraph (d) willbe retained but revised accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="72">PART 1388_THE UNIVERSITY AFFILIATED PROGRAMS</ITAG>Section 1388.9 PeerReviewSection 1388.9(b) of the NPRM proposed that all applications for fundingopportunities under Part D of the Act must be evaluated through the peerreview process.<T3>Comment:</T3> Following further consideration of the proposed languagefor Section 1388.9(b) we concluded that the phrase ``including applicationsfor'' suggested that grants under the University Affiliated Programs (UAPs)provisions could be for purposes other than (1) core UAPs and SatelliteCenter funding, (2) feasibility studies, and (3) training projects in areasof emerging national significance.<T3>Response:</T3> Since these are the only purposes for which fundingis available to UAPs under the Act, we have deleted the word ``including''and substituted the term ``consisting of.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Impact Analysis</ITAG>Executive Order 12291Executive Order 12291 requires that a regulatory impact analysis be preparedfor major rules_defined in the Order as any rule that has an annual effecton the national economy of $100 million or more, or certain other specifiedeffects. These regulations primarily affect State agencies and UniversityAffiliated Programs. The basic requirements of the program are establishedby the statute, not these regulations. Therefore, the Department concludesthat these regulations are not major rules within the meaning of the ExecutiveOrder, because they do not have an effect on the economy of $100 millionor more or meet the other threshold criteria.Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act [5 U.S.C. Ch. 6], we tryto anticipate and reduce the impact of rules and paperwork requirementson small businesses. For each rule with a ``significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities'', we prepare an analysis describingthe rule's impact on small entities. The primary impact of these regulationsis on the States, which are not ``small entities'' within the meaning ofthe Act. For these reasons, the Secretary certifies that these rules willnot have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.Paperwork Reduction ActUnder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-511, all Departmentsare required to submit to the Office of Management and Budget for reviewand approval any reporting or recordkeeping requirement contained in aproposed or final rule. This proposed rule does not contain informationcollection requirements or increase Federal paperwork burden on the publicor private sector.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>45 CFR Part 1385Grant programs/education, Grant programs/social programs, Handicapped,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.45 CFR Part 1386Administrative practice and procedure, Grant programs/education, Handicapped,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.45 CFR 1387Grant programs/education, Grant programs/social programs, Handicapped.45 CFR Part 1388Colleges and universities, Grant programs/education, Grant programs/socialprograms, university affiliated program, satellite center.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program, Nos. 13.630 DevelopmentalDisabilities Basic Support and 13.631 Developmental Disabilities_Projectsof National Significance, and 13.632 Developmental Disabilities_UniversityAffiliated Program)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Mary Sheila Gall,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Assistant Secretary for Human Development Services.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: November 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Louis W.
