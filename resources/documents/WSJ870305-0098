Combustion Engineering Inc. recently signed a letter of intent for a joint venture with the Soviet Ministry of Oil Refining and Petrochemical Industries. &quot;The market is large, and there's a demand for our product,&quot; which is process-control equipment for refineries, says Eugene Madara, vice president of the Combustion Engineering unit in the venture. But he stresses that &quot;nobody is going in there with rose-colored glasses.&quot;    Yuri Shcherbina, chairman of the Soviet trading concern Amtorg Corp., reports that the first wave of inquiries came from &quot;about 15 American companies with whom we are now negotiating further details.&quot; He won't identify those companies, but Combustion Engineering, Monsanto Co., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Cummins Engine Co. and Eli Lilly andamp; Co., among others, have indicated interest in Soviet joint ventures. The State Department says other U.S. parties prefer to explore the opening quietly.    Most of these companies have dealt in the past with the Soviets. They are trying to discover if they can get a better return from joint ventures than from the sale and construction of complete plants, or barter and counter-trade accords to which they had been previously confined. Some companies realize it may take years to find out if there are profits to be made by participating in the sluggish Soviet economy.    Sarah Carey, a Washington-based lawyer advising many of these companies, believes that a few sectors, such as pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals, are well-positioned to profit from investment in the Soviet Union. There aren't any U.S. export controls on this technology, &quot;and the demand is enormous and unmet,&quot; she says.    A Monsanto proposal may fit this description. Richard Mahoney, Monsanto's chairman, has announced a six-month study of a joint venture with the Soviet Ministry of Mineral Fertilizers that would produce chemical herbicides for domestic and foreign consumption. &quot;We intend to make a profit,&quot; says Monsanto spokesman Michael Petrilli. &quot;If we can't, we won't go through with it.&quot;    Combustion Engineering's Mr. Madara expects the company to obtain licenses to export the technology for its proposed joint venture with the oil refining and petrochemical ministry. The Reagan administration now encourages &quot;nonstrategic&quot; trade with the Soviet Union, and the process-control technology that Combustion Engineering proposes to sell falls in that category, he says.    Both U.S. companies are proceeding gradually, though. Combustion Engineering will initially collect a fee for the technology it sells to its joint venture. It will then train Soviet workers to convert the technology into manufactured goods with the use of U.S.-made components. Finally, the joint-venture project will design and manufacture these products itself.    The new rules, which Soviet officials hope will attract foreign investment and technology to modernize the Soviet economy, allow foreign partners to own as much as 49% of joint ventures with Soviet entities. The rules also guarantee that foreign partners can repatriate profits in hard currency, a clear improvement from the cumbersome barter deals that still prevail.    PepsiCo Inc., for instance, gets vodka in exchange for beverage concentrates it ships to the Soviet Union. Because PepsiCo doesn't like to sell the vodka itself, it has given the rights to import the product to another company, Monsieur Henri Wines Ltd., which pays PepsiCo out of the proceeds of vodka sales.    Of course, doubts and questions remain about the venture rules. Some U.S. firms are wary about a provision that frees joint ventures from involvement in the centrally planned economy. &quot;We want it both ways,&quot; admits Peter Pettibone, a New York-based legal adviser for some of the interested U.S. companies. &quot;We want access to domestic raw materials. But if there's a screw-up, we'd like the option of buying the goods from Finland.&quot;    John Becker, a foreign-trade director for Cummins Engine, faults the law for placing limits on the foreign partners' ability to manage the ventures. &quot;They've missed the point,&quot; he says. &quot;The greatest benefits we offer isn't capital or hardware but our management and marketing skills.&quot;    The Soviets are linking these joint-venture opportunities with their own access to Western markets. In a recent briefing for U.S. businessmen, Amtorg's Mr. Shcherbina said that companies from countries that grant Soviet exports most-favored-nation status would be in a &quot;somewhat preferable position&quot; to be accepted as joint-venture partners. The U.S., in keeping with a 1974 law that makes such treatment contingent on Soviet immigration policies, imposes discriminatory tariffs on Soviet goods.    The State Department also cautions that there could be a &quot;mismatch&quot; in U.S. and Soviet expectations. &quot;We're eyeing the huge Soviet market while the Soviets are thinking of export platforms,&quot; a U.S. diplomat says.    Still, Mrs. Carey, the Soviet-trade specialist, sees pragmatism at work on both sides. Certain Soviet principals are willing to allow a joint venture to obtain as much as 75% of its revenue inside the Soviet Union, she reports. </TEXT></DOC>
