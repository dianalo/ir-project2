Three series of Co/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalysts were studied:one containing a constant Co loading of 3 wt% and boron loading of 0.3to 3 wt%, and two series containing 0.7 to 10 wt% Co and constant boronloadings of either 0 or 3 wt%. In the absence of boron, Co dispersiondecreased with increasing Co loading above 1.5 wt% Co. The presence ofboron had little effect on Co dispersion at low Co loadings, while catalystswith Co loadings in excess of 1.5 wt% exhibited an increase in Co dispersioncompared to boron-free catalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, diffusereflectance spectroscopy, and gravimetric analysis were used to quantifythe Co species present on the catalysts as a function of both Co andboron loading. In the absence of boron, Co exists as tetrahedral andoctahedral Co{sup 2+} at low Co loadings, while Co{sub 3}O{sub 4} isthe primary phase at higher Co loadings. In the presence of boron, Co{sub3}O{sub 4} formation is suppressed for catalysts with Co loadings lessthan 8 wt% in favor of octahedral Co{sup 2+} and minor amounts of Coborate. The formation of Co{sub 3}O{sub 4} occurs at Co loadings greaterthan 6 wt% for boron-containing catalysts. A mechanism is described toaccount for the effect of boron on the dispersion and chemical stateof Co. 41 references.</TEXT></DOC>
