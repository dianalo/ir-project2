For a long time, I didn't hear from the editor in charge of thisproject. When I finally got to see my manuscript again, there were errors offact added to it and original research work deleted.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business Monday  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SOMETIMES INTEGRITY DICTATES THAT YOU HAVETO MAKE TROUBLE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  ManagementManaging at workAndrew Grove is chief executive officer of Intel Corp. of Santa Clara.

While perhaps the changes weren't major, therevised manuscript was a poor reflection on me, and my professional reputationis very important to me. However, when I complained to the editor I gotnowhere.;    I decided to escalate the issue to his boss. This required that Iexplain the changes to someone who was not intimately familiar with theissues, so I had to generate copious documentation to support my complaints.;   We went back and forth for a while. I eventually got the changes made, butonly after I indicated that I would withdraw my name from the pieceotherwise.;    All this cost me a lot of time and work, and it affected myrelationship with my customer. In the process, I was made to feel like I was atroublemaker.;    I wonder now if it was all worth it.;    But I also wonder:Aren't there times when we simply have no choice but to become troublemakers?;   A There certainly are such times.;    Certainly, when issues of basicintegrity are involved, creating &quot;trouble&quot; is almost unavoidable. However,when you differ over how certain things should be done and you can't get yourway, it may well be better to shrug and go on with your work. Working withothers requires adaptation.;    Where your situation fits depends on questionslike how material the alterations in the manuscript were -- did they changethe tenor of your work or the conclusions the reader would have come to or didthey merely tell and illustrate the story differently? You seem to havedecided that it fits into the former category. And I certainly can't arguewith your conclusion. In that case, you did the right thing.;    Q I have beenan industrial equipment salesman for the past 12 years. A little over a yearago, I was approached by a competitor with a job offer.;    I accepted andbegan work. After three months, the owner asked me to sign an employeeagreement committing not to divulge any company trade secrets, includingcustomers' names, and not to call on any company in my territory for one yearafter termination of employment on behalf of a competitor.;    I reluctantlysigned this agreement, but it has now come back to haunt me.;    There is nowanother opportunity within the same industry and territory that I want topursue. I am frustrated and angry. I feel I was taken advantage of because Iwas made to sign it only after I started working for this company.;    A Ihave no sympathy for you -- for jumping around and selling for your employer'scompetitors and wanting to make a career out of such a practice -- or for youremployer who springs such an agreement on you three months after you startworking.;    It seems that you deserve each other.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Andrew Grove column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910325  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  583  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday March 25, 199100085015,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
