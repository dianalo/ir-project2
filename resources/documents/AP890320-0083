That's the issue as House Republicans try to decide on asuccessor to Dick Cheney, the new secretary of defense who vacatedthe job of minority whip, the GOP's second highest post in thechamber.   Rep. Edward Madigan, 53, of Illinois is the solid, steadylawmaker who makes few headlines but has climbed to stature withinthe hallways of Capitol Hill.   Rep. Newt Gingrich, 45, of Georgia is the ideologicalrabble-rouser who brashly describes himself as ``a national leaderwho serves in the House.''   The clear choice between two styles and directions is beingpresented this week to a Republican group that is itself torn. TheGOP's usual posture of working with the ruling Democrats to win whatit can has lost favor with some Republicans who want to lash out infrustration after more than three decades as the minority party.   The decision could color the proceedings of the House for sometime to come. The winner of the race will become the heir apparentto House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., who is expected toretire in the next few years.   ``It is a kind of a watershed,'' said Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn.   Outside of Washington, Gingrich is by far the better known of thetwo candidates. The leader of the Conservative Opportunity Societycan't keep away from the television cameras and, like his nemesis,House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, has a penchant for hyperbole thatleaps into print.   ``I bring to the office of whip a national network, nationalissues, national resources, personal ties to (Republican ChairmanLee) Atwater, personal ties to the Bush presidential campaign,personal ties to the executive branch...'' he said, touting hisqualifications at a news conference last Friday.   Madigan is what the party wants if ``it would prefer to remain inthe minority,'' Gingrich said. ``I am deeply committed to ending the36-year Democratic monopoly of power in the House,'' he said.   It was Gingrich who made the official complaint that launched thecurrent House ethics committee probe of the Democratic Speaker, JimWright of Texas, a move that many on both sides of the aisle atfirst considered too daring, too much rocking the boat.   Part of that complaint involved an favorable deal under which thespeaker published and sold a compilation of personal reflections. Apublished report today showed that Gingrich also had an unusual bookarrangement, with political allies forming a limited partnership topay for promoting a book Gingrich co-wrote.   Gingrich argues he is cut out for being the minority whip, a jobof head counting, head bashing and organization. He cites his fightin the House Administration Committee to get Republicans more staffslots in the House.   He says his election as whip also would mean ``integrating ...the process of legislation and the process of national opinion.That's a totally different race than the normal whip race.''   It would be a handy cliche to say that Madigan ``bristles'' atGingrich's suggestion that he's the choice of the status quo,Republican minority, but he doesn't. He calls no press conferences.In an interview, he calmly tries to refute Gingrich's portrayal ofthe race and makes clear that he's talking only about a differentkind of hardball.   ``There are no content Republicans. All Republicans want to be inthe majority,'' he said. ``And we are an odds-on bet to do that in1992 without respect to who is elected whip,'' because ofreapportionment and party strength, he said.   Madigan, the current deputy whip and a senior member of theAgriculture and Energy and Commerce committees, has been conductinga low-key campaign ``based on my demeanor, and experience, andlegislative accomplishments.''   ``I love this institution. I want it to be occupied by aRepublican majority. I do not want it destroyed.'' The last is aclear reference to Gingrich's willingness to employ radical tactics,but Madigan denies it. ``I'm not saying anything about Mr. Gingrich,his campaign, or anything that he says,'' he said.   To Gingrich, the Democratic majority is a corrupt dictatorship.He's even compared his feelings toward Speaker Wright to hisfeelings toward convicted murderers.   Madigan is more sympathetic.   ``The Democrats are as frustrated as the Republicans and are nomore effective as a majority than we are as a minority,'' he said.``I think they relieve their frustrations by crapping on Republicansand think that that's some kind of accomplishment, when it's noaccomplishment at all.   ``I just feel that somebody needs to challenge them to a higherstandard of behavior and productivity,'' he said.   The Republican election is expected to take place at a partyconference next Wednesday.   There are just 174 qualified voters, and it's hard to predictwho'll come out on top.   And there's a potential wild card _ Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois,a popular conservative who declined to run but has left himself openfor a draft movement announced by Rep. Jerry Solomon, R-N.Y.   On Friday, both Gingrich and Madigan said they were about to goover the top in commitments _ predictions close watchers of the racetook with a grain of salt.   ``With those numbers, we're now a majority party,'' quipped a topHouse GOP aide.</TEXT></DOC>
