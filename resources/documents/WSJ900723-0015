Corporate purchases gave stock prices a major push in the1980s, but this mode of propulsion lost steam quickly thisyear as prices pushed to record highs.</LP><TEXT>   So far, this lost supply of buying power has been morethan replaced by other players, among which are mutual fundsthat are growing bigger as individual investors pour cashinto them. But fewer corporate buy-backs means lessunderlying support when these other investors bolt for theexits, which happened Friday when more earningsdisappointments helped sink the Dow Jones Industrial Average32.67 points to 2961.14.   Corporate stock buy-backs and takeover mania, whichrapidly shrank the supply of stock available to investors,reached a frenzied pace in the 1980s. From 1984 through 1989,the combination of takeovers and buy-backs reduced the marketvalue of all New York Stock Exchange-listed issues by anaverage 6.5% a year, Goldman Sachs estimates. A smallersupply of stock during a period of high investor demandhelped buoy prices. Goldman figures overall corporatepurchases accounted for more than a fifth of the 114.8% risein the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index in the decade'ssecond half.   But this year, corporate demand for stocks throughtakeovers and buy-backs is waning. After adjusting for aquickened flow of new stock issues, the annualized rate atwhich shares are being taken out of investors' hands hasfallen to the lowest level since 1984. Goldman Sachsestimates that the rate of shrinkage in Big Board marketvalue will slow to 3% or less this year.   Robert Farrell, chief market strategist for Merrill Lynch,suspects corporations are on the way to becoming net sellersof stock after seven years of being net buyers. Companieswill use proceeds from selling new shares to retire debt, hepredicts.   Throughout the 1980s, companies gobbled up their ownshares or took over other concerns because both tactics werecheaper than the cost of replacing corporate assets orstarting a business from scratch. But in the process, manycompanies took on a lot of debt.   &quot;Now corporations will start using any opportunity theyget to sell equity in order to pay down debt and reduceinterest costs,&quot; says Mr. Farrell.   At the start of the bull market in 1982, says StevenEinhorn, portfolio strategist at Goldman Sachs, stocksgenerally were selling at 50% of the per-share cost ofreplicating companies' assets. Now many stocks are trading ata premium to replacement value. That means, he says, buyingits own stock isn't any longer a smart way for a company toinvest its cash.   The buy-back fad is fading before many large companieshave completed purchases of all the shares they announcedmonths ago that they might buy, notes Laszlo Birinyi ofBirinyi Associates, a research firm. As of the end of 1989,the 30 companies whose stocks make up the Dow Jonesindustrials had purchased only a fourth of the 685.4 millionshares they had authorized themselves to buy.   Theoretically, these companies could come back into themarket when prices head lower, but because of a sluggisheconomy and high interest payments on debt, companies haveless cash these days to buy shares.   Reduced corporate stock purchases isn't necessarily allnegative for the market, though, analysts say. For example,the much-slowed pace of takeovers means pension-fund capitalis being diverted from once-hot buy-out pools. &quot;Part of thatmoney is coming in the front door {of the stock market, asdirect investment} instead of the back door,&quot; Mr. Birinyisuggests.   Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs says the decline of takeoverspeculation should free up more capital for investing in abroader array of stocks. The latest rally has beenconcentrated in growth stocks, which many analysts complainmakes for a cockeyed advance that can't be sustained.Theoretically, says Mr. Einhorn, as the focus on big stocksdeclines, smaller stocks have a chance to outperform thelarger ones. In practice, it hasn't happened yet.   But James D. Awad, president of BMI Capital, a moneymanager, says that while 1980s-style takeover speculation hasebbed, a new wave of takeover activity in smaller companieswill help spur investor enthusiasm.   &quot;Investment bankers still have to make a living,&quot; he says.&quot;The theme is to move away from highly leveraged financialtakeovers toward all-cash strategic acquisitions of small tomedium-sized growing companies, especially niche companies.&quot;This is the undervalued part of the market, he says.   As for whether individual investors can take up thestock-buying slack left by corporations, the jury is stillout. Some analysts think individuals are ready to become moreactive in the stock market. While the stock portion ofindividually held assets has shrunk to a historically lowlevel, the recent heavy flow of cash into mutual fundssuggests that trend is reversing.   Carmine Grigoli, vice president, equity research, at FirstBoston, notes that the average individual's net worthcurrently is just 14% in stocks, down from 26% in 1965.During the same period, the real estate portion, includingthe individual's home, has risen to 29% from 21%. Realigningthose relationships presumably would help offset a slowdownin corporate buying.   Individuals whose net worth now is heavily in real estatewill increasingly move cash into stocks as they seekinvestments that will outperform the rate of inflation, Mr.Grigoli says. A real estate recession, which has beset manyregions of the nation, makes people feel less wealthy andinclined to save more and spend less; much of that cash islikely to go into mutual funds, with stocks promising ahigher rate of return than real estate, he says.   &quot;More people are going to be renting and saving ratherthan buying real estate,&quot; says Mr. Grigoli. He predicts thatthe strong flow of money into mutual funds will continue forthree to five years, when a recovered real estate market,among other things, may compete more effectively forinvestors' funds.   Not all analysts agree with this scenario. Among them isAbby Joseph Cohen, market strategist at Barclays de ZoeteWedd Research, who has been steadfastly bearish throughoutthe market's latest rally.   Ms. Cohen agrees that corporate buying has been&quot;enormously important&quot; in lifting the stock market to itscurrent levels. But she says no matter how unattractive otherinvestments such as real estate may look by comparison,institutional and individual investors eventually willrealize, as corporations apparently have, that many stocksare overpriced. Besides, she says, there are investmentalternatives, such as U.S. Treasury bonds and bills.   Meanwhile, Ms. Cohen is bothered that much of the buyingin the recent rally has been centered on the big-namecompanies with strong, dependable earnings growth. &quot;You endup with a tiering of the market,&quot; she says, as a small, elitegroup of stocks zoom way out front and the rest plod along inthe dust.   &quot;How long can that last?&quot; she asks. Not very, she says.And when the next big market break comes, &quot;These {elite}stocks will be the hardest hit. You can only sell what youown, and investors like to sell what they can at a profit.&quot;   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Stock prices dropped sharply as the latest shock waves oncorporate earnings reverberated through the market,especially in the technology sector.   Although the market held firm through most of the sessionamid disappointing earnings developments at StorageTechnology and Advanced Micro Devices, prices tumbled nearthe close after Texas Instruments' second-quarter results andoutlook provided more bad news.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rallied past 3000at midday, fell more than 34 points in the final hour oftrading.   The expiration of July stock-index futures and optionscontributed to the market's slide, traders said. A number ofexpiration-related buy orders that were placed in advance ofthe earnings report from Texas Instruments were quicklycanceled when the news came out, said Thomas Gallagher,managing director in charge of capital commitment atOppenheimer andamp; Co.   Then sell orders in the Chicago stock-index futuresmarkets triggered stock-index arbitrage sell programs. Thetactic involved buying futures contracts and selling stocksto lock in price differences between the two.   The late wave of selling pushed New York Stock Exchangevolume to 177,810,000 shares, compared with 162 millionThursday. On the Big Board, declining stocks beat advancersby 912 to 585.   Among broader market measures, the Sandamp;P 500 fell 3.71 to361.61; the New York Stock Exchange composite index lost 1.73to 197.65; and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index tumbled 3.18to 335.87.   The Friday retreat left the Dow industrials with a lossfor the week of 19.06 points, or 0.6%. Other indices postedsharper declines: the Sandamp;P 500 fell 1.6% for the week; the BigBoard's composite index lost 1.3%; and the Dow Jones EquityMarket Index retreated 1.7%.   With the market &quot;breaking one stock after another&quot; inresponse to disappointing earnings, Oppenheimer's ThomasGallagher said institutions are likely to become morehesitant in committing more cash to stocks now.   &quot;People are getting annihilated, losing tons of moneyhere,&quot; Mr. Gallagher said. &quot;There is no chance to get out ofa {stock} position when things go bad.&quot;   Texas Instruments dropped 5 3/4 to 33 1/8 following itsreport that second-quarter net income tumbled 89.6% from ayear earlier. The company also said it may report a loss forthe third quarter, noting that it expects the semiconductormarket to be &quot;sluggish&quot; for the next few months.   Advanced Micro Devices, another chip maker, plunged 1 3/4to 7 1/4 on 1.4 million shares in the wake of itsdisappointing second-quarter results. The company reported aloss of 10 cents per share. Analysts had expected the companyto break even or report a modest profit.   Storage Technology, which had been one of thebest-performing stocks of the year, plunged 8 3/4 to 25 3/4on 4.8 million shares. Although the company reported that itssecond-quarter earnings surged about 250% from a yearearlier, it warned analysts that earnings for the full year&quot;may end up being at the low end instead of the high end&quot; ofWall Street's current forecasts. Demand in New England andUnited Kingdom markets has been weaker than expected, thecompany noted.   ---                                                                                                                                     NO.

In January 1990 it authorizeda new 25 million-share buy-back, under which six millionshares have been purchased. A table in Monday's editionmisstated the status of these purchases.
