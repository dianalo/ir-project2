Some crude oil was down yesterday by 20 cents a barreldespite predictions by a growing number of oil analysts aswell as OPEC oil ministers that prices will rise over theweeks ahead -- possibly by as much as $2 a barrel by yearend.</LP><TEXT>   Celestino Armas, Venezuela's oil minister and president ofthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, was amongthose making such predictions. He told a Caracas newsconference that the average price of the OPEC basket of sevencrudes, currently just under $19 a barrel, should reach atargeted $21 in the fourth quarter when demand risesseasonally. &quot;I am optimistic that the year will close withthat price,&quot; he said, citing the continuing declines inproduction in the Soviet Union.   Yesterday, however, there was little evidence of such afirming trend on either U.S. or European spot or futuresmarkets. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil forOctober delivery settled 20 cents lower at $21.62 a barrel.The November crude contract declined 18 cents to $21.54.   On London's International Petroleum Exchange, crudefutures were down as much as 19 cents a barrel. Fuels futuresalso dropped, with some petroleum products down as much asone cent or more a gallon.   Technical factors drew some blame. But traders and oilanalysts generally cited expectations of a bearish industryreport on U.S. oil inventories. A survey by the Dow JonesInternational Petroleum Report showed that traders andanalysts anticipated inventories of crude oil rose around onemillion barrels last week.   The American Petroleum Institute's latest weekly report onU.S. oil statistics was released late yesterday after tradinghad ceased on the New York Mercantile Exchange. But insteadof the expected gain in crude oil inventories the reportshowed a huge drop of 6.3 million barrels last week.   &quot;So much for bearish APIs,&quot; said AnnLouise Hittle, asenior oil and gas analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.&quot;Despite the pullback {in yesterday's prices}, there is goodrefiner demand for crude oil,&quot; she said, adding that U.S.prices should strengthen toward $23 a barrel in the fourthquarter.   Some others look for slightly bigger gains. In a report,Michael Rothman and John Gambino, Merrill Lynch senioranalysts, foresee West Texas Intermediate, the U.S.benchmark, at around $24 toward &quot;the end of the year on theprospects that oil supplies may become more prone totightness, rather than excessiveness.&quot;   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: In trading at the Chicago MercantileExchange, prices of cattle futures contracts rose slightly.Traders expect the Agriculture Department monthly feedlotsurvey slated for release today to signal that the supply offattened cattle will tighten by winter. John Nalivka,executive vice president of Sterling Marketing Inc., Lenexa,Kan., said he expects the seven-state survey to show that 14%fewer young cattle were placed on feedlots in August,compared with August 1990. Other analysts are predicting a 9%decline in August placements. Traders are speculating thatranchers in August retreated from selling their cattle tofeedlots, which fatten the animals for slaughter, becausecattle prices sank a steep 7% from July. Prices weredepressed by a combination of seasonally slow retail demandfor beef and a glut of unusually heavy cattle that were readyfor slaughter. Most of the young cattle put on feedlots lastmonth will be ready for slaughter early next year, whichcould set the stage for firmer prices by then, analysts said.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose. Gold for Septemberdelivery gained $2.20 an ounce to end at $346.70; theactively traded December contract finished at $350.40, up$2.10. September silver advanced 5.9 cents an ounce to$4.057; the actively traded December contract rose six centsto $4.11. October platinum, which fell below gold in lateJuly but is again trading at a premium to gold, finished$3.70 an ounce higher at $353.50. William O'Neill, seniorfutures strategist at Merrill Lynch, said buying of silverand, to a lesser extent, platinum, has been strong out ofSwitzerland for two days. The physical market for all threemetals has improved recently, he added. James Kneafsey,president of Cambridge Financial Management, an institutionalmoney management company in Cambridge, Mass., said hebelieves silver has hit bottom. As long as December silverremains above $4, a technical indication that the price hasstabilized, silver will attract &quot;good quality buying,&quot; hesaid. Gold, meanwhile, might decline further, perhaps another$10 to $20, Mr. Kneafsey said. Gold isn't likely to sustainany rally until inflation begins to pick up, he said.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices continued to fall. Copper forSeptember delivery ended 1.20 cents a pound lower at $1.044;the actively traded December contract dropped 1.65 cents,finishing at $1.015. Analysts attributed the decline toproducer selling and profit-taking after the recent pricerun-up. Fred Demler, metals economist at PaineWebber, notedthe supply-and-demand balance during the first half of theyear was bearish. World-wide mine production for the firstsix months was up 12% from a year earlier, but shipments ofrefined copper, an indication of consumption, fell by 7%.World-wide inventories increased sharply, up 50% from thesummer of 1990. More recent data, however, indicate someimprovement: Scrap metal is in tight supply, the dealerpremium of cathode prices over Comex prices has increased,and the premium of nearby futures contracts over later monthshas widened, he said. Moreover, brass and rod millconsumption was up about 8% in July from a year earlier,after being down 7.5% in the first half, he said. With thestatistics and market sentiment beginning to improve, Mr.Demler expects prices to rise over the next six months,perhaps as high as $1.15 to $1.20. Over the next few days,however, prices will probably fall, perhaps to $1 for theDecember contract, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
