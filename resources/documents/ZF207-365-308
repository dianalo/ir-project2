 Desktop publishing and electronicpublishing systems for engineering workstations made it easier to producepaper-based documents, but they did little to create a demand for documentsthat would be read on computer screens.andM;Paper-based media will continue to be the preferred method of distributionfor most publications in the foreseeable future, but the demand forelectronic documents is now starting to surface in paper-intensiveapplications, such as technical documentation.andP;  (One speaker pointed out thatthe paper-based documentation supporting a new nuclear submarine does not fiton the submarine.)andP;  The day-long session entitled &quot;Publishing Without Paper&quot;focused on the issues and experiences of vendors and users trying to publishinformation in electronic form, whether it be CD-ROM, magnetic tape orvideotex.andP;  In addition to technical documentation, other applications thatwere explored in this session included educational materials and simulation.andM;But how do I find it?andP;  The initiative to receive information digitally hassparked interest in interactive tools for finding and retrieving theinformation that resides somewhere beyond the screen in the unseen recessesof the computer.andP;  The tools at the user's disposal must provide as quick andreliable access to specific information (part numbers, stock quotes, healthclaims, etc.) through simple querying, contents and indexing facilities, yetat the same time be as intuitive and unstructured, as the free-associationthat takes place in your head as you go about locating information on generaltopics, whether it be in a library, newspaper morgue, shipyard, manufacturingshop floor or the engineering lab at a software house.andM;Traditionally, the tools for electronic retrieval took one of three forms:either they presumed a structured database, from which records could belocated by queries or listings based on fields; or they were achives ofimages or text.andP;  Images were retrieved by key-word indexes; text retrievalhas been enhanced by inverted indexing techniques that enable the user tofind all documents that contain words that the user specifies--even if thosewords were not key-indexed.andM;New Tools.andP;  The existing tools for finding documents are not about to goaway, but they are being extended to include new possibilities, such asnonsequential access through the hypertext links and intelligent outlinesbased on object-oriented programming.andP;  Right now, most of the efforts byvendors and users are in integrating these new tools into a network ofpublished documents.andP;  The idea is to focus first on retrieving and viewingstatic information stored all over the network in different formats.andO;Eventually, these new tools will be applied to editable documents, as Applehas done in a single-user environment with HyperCard.andM;Conference NotesandM;Mills Davis, of Davis, Inc., summarized the wide-ranging topics coveredthroughout the day with a survey of the market and its future directions.andO;Davis talked about &quot;Making Sense of Next-Generation Publishing,&quot; and hepointed to several trends that would distinguish future publishing approachesfrom those of today.andP;  For example, there will be far more computer poweravailable.andP;  That will make it practical to use artificial intelligencetechniques for things like grammar-checking and optical text recognition andfor finding patterns in large amounts of data.andP;  This computer power will alsopermit photo-realistic rendering on desktop platforms so that simulation maybe offered as an alternative learning method to reading.andP;  Greater storagewill make hypertext viable.andP;  Better networking software will make group-basedpublishing more efficient and more manageable.andM;It is important to monitor these changes and relate them to the publishingprocess.andP;  Davis warned that a narrow view of the publishing process can leadto &quot;tunnel vision&quot; and the danger of being &quot;blind-sided&quot; by a technology thatbypasses conventional processes.andM;Jacqueline Kahle of DEC followed by grouping electronic information deliveryinto two categories: a one-way path distributing standardized information tolarge numbers of people and a two-way course involving interaction ofindividuals and workgroups.andP;  She noted that DEC's Compound DocumentArchitecture is a mechanism for transferring information among applicationsof all kinds.andM;Peter Eddison of Fulcrum Technologies continued with a discussion offull-text retrieval.andP;  He grouped the features of full-text software intothree categories: functionality, ease of use and performance.andM;Functionality, for the user, means that when you make a request you &quot;get whatyou want and want what you get.&quot;andP;  In other words, the relevant documents arefound and others are skipped.andP;  This can be achieved via boolean combinationsof terms, by a thesaurus, by weighting of terms, and by other techniques.andO;Ease of use means the use of the tool must be intuitive, and it must adapt tothe needs of both the occasional user and the retrieval professional.andP;  Forthe author, ease of use means that the full-text system must not imposeadditional constraints on the editorial process.andP;  Performance, for the user,means that retrieval and browsing are fast.andP;  For the author, it means thatindexing is fast and the overhead associated with the index files is low.andM;Eddison talked about the need for standards and for carefully specifiedformal interfaces.andP;  These are all-important if modules created by one companyare to be integrated into the products of another.andP;  In many areas, usefulstandards are already in place, and in others they are coming.andP;  For example,the airline industry is trying to standardize the way data is stored on aCD-ROM, so that a variety of retrieval packages can be used.andP;  (Right now,although the basic formatting of CD-ROMS is standardized, the layout of thedata is tied to the retrieval package in use.)andM;In response to a question, Eddison said that an AT-class computer is adequatefor full-text retrieval even with databases that are quite large, once thematerial has been indexed.andP;  But indexing requires a lot of computer power andshould be done on a larger machine if the amount of data warrants it.andM;Approaches to documentationandM;Three of the day's 13 presentations were by end-users, and two of these hadtechnical documentation applications.andP;  William Seltzer, of Cummins EngineCompany, described the difficulty of managing parts documentation for dieselengines that are being manufactured and repaired all over the world.andP;  Cumminshas a standing database of 30,000 pages of documentation, of which 40 percentare drawings.andM;At the center of the publishing operation are 12 editors at the company'sColumbus, Indiana headquarters.andP;  They use PCs on a Novell network to createdocumentation based on material received from product engineers.andP;  Also tiedinto this network are a Xyvision typesetting system, a scanning subsystemfrom Intran, a Computervision CAD system, and corporate IBM mainframes.andP;  Themainframes host a telecommunications network that reaches dozens of sitesaround the world.andM;Cummins has been working to provide its far-flung users with access todocumentation in several formats: paper, microfiche, and (soon) online andCD-ROM.andP;  Though they share common data, these media need different kinds ofindexing and access tools.andP;  The table of contents and back-of-the-book indexthat works well with paper is inappropriate for fiche, which must have anindex frame (in the same location on each 288-page card) and index stripes tohelp with topic location.andP;  For CD-ROM and online access, other modes ofaccess (including full-text and keyword searches) are important.andM;Asked if CD-ROM would eventually replace fiche, Seltzer responded that &quot;younever lose what you have,&quot; and fiche will continue to have a role at Cumminsas long as there is a user base with fiche readers but no computers.andP;  Heinvoked the image of a mechanic in Kenya working on an engine in a shed witha dirt floor.andP;  In such a situation, a basic-model fiche reader might be apossibility, but a computer with a CD-ROM drive would be out of the questionfor the foreseeable future.andM;The publishing issues at Cummins are not too different from those discussedby Keith Bronder of Northern Telecom, Inc. later in the day.andP;  But thesolution at Northern Telecom took a somewhat different shape.andM;Northern Telecom makes electronic telephone switching gear.andP;  Some systems arequite complex: the manuals for one particular switch occupy 42 feet of shelfspace.andP;  Northern found its documentation was becoming too bulky, too costly,too difficult to use, and too hard to update.andP;  So the company began toinvestigate technologies that could address the problem.andM;The initial goal of this effort was to find an approach that could deliverthe exact equivalent of the paper documentation, but do it electronically.andO;Longer term, the company wanted to develop a mechanism for all-electroniccreation and delivery and to provide authors with a suitable set ofelectronic tools.andP;  Another goal was to develop ways of measuring productivityand quality (but specifically not simple volume measurements) of thedocumentation group.andP;  These objectives were to be met, as much as possible,using standard approaches.andM;The DMR Group, a consulting group based in Wellesley, MA, was hired to helpassess the options.andP;  (Elias Safdie, from DMR, shared the presentation withBronder).andM;Existing technology had to be taken into account.andP;  Northern Telecom couldn'ttell its customers what equipment to get, and quite a few of them just hadASCII text-only terminals.andP;  Some support for these terminals had to beprovided.andP;  Some customers did have terminals with graphics capabilities, butthese included Macs; PCs with CGA, VGA, EGA, and Hercules graphics; and UnixWorkstations.andP;  Even the documentation authors used various incompatible kindsof equipment.andM;It was decided that text-only terminals could best be supported via a dial-intext-search capability, while the PCs and workstations would be served byCD-ROM documentation.andP;  DMR went to work on a strategy for formatting the dataon CD-ROM.andM;The approach selected was based on the creation of PostScript pages by theauthoring groups.andP;  PostScript is available as an output format on mostpackages.andP;  On the CD-ROM, however, the pages are stored in Computer GraphicsMetafile (CGM) format.andP;  This vector-graphics format is resolution-independentand is much more compact than PostScript.andM;A proprietary indexing scheme was developed, allowing full-text search(including text that appears in graphics).andP;  This was coupled with a set ofwindows-based viewing modules (one for each platform) for displayingretrieved pages.andM;While the project has had its ups and downs (&quot;bumps in the road&quot; is thephrase Safdie used), it is now well into production.andP;  The first PC-orientedsoftware and CD-ROMS were released to test sites in January of 1988.andP;  Theinitial Macintosh software followed in April.andP;  By the end of 1988, theinitial production version was ready.andP;  A Unix version is expected this comingsummer.andM;Later, more features will be added, such as bookmarking (to return to aspecific page), annotation, cut and paste (to extract material forincorporation into another document), and hyperlink features.andP;  NorthernTelecom is also finding that its customers want to load documents into theirown internal computer networks--networks which are just as diverse as theirterminals, PCs, and workstations.andM;The new CD-ROM documentation turns out to be much cheaper to deliver thanpaper (although Northern Telecom must still keep all its documentation inprint), and users are able to find things faster in the CD-ROM version.andP;  (Inone test we heard about, locating a bit of information required an average of4 minutes on the CD-ROM versus 38 minutes in the paper manuals.)andM;Both of these end users had started with the simplest case: delivering pageselectronically.andP;  Both acknowledged that this was just a first step and thateventually material would be created without commitment to page format.andO;Steve Brown of Datalogics addressed the implications of leaving the structureof the page.andM;The problem with page-based approaches.andP;  There are problems with paper,especially in complex technical documentation environments.andP;  It can be hardto find things: the Air Force found that technicians spend 30 percent oftheir time searching manuals.andP;  Model variation is a problem: at any giventime, all the aircraft in a fleet may be at different stages of change, dueto rolling field upgrade programs.andP;  It is difficult to know which documentsapply to a given plane.andP;  Sheer volume is a problem: the B-1 bomber has amillion pages of documentation (!) whereas the earlier B-29 had only athousand.andP;  And field revision of looseleaf documentation is error-pronebecause of misfiling of changed pages.andM;The organization of paged material is a problem for maintenance manuals.andO;Suppose many different procedures require the removal of an access panel.andO;Must the removal steps be repeated in each?andP;  That makes the documentationunwieldy and repetitious.andP;  But if such common procedures are documented onlyonce and then referred to in many places, the maintenance technician ends upconstantly flipping back and forth in the manuals.andP;  Neither solution issatisfactory.andM;If the documentation is electronic, on the other hand, these problems can besolved and lots of new opportunities appear.andP;  The documentation can be madepart of an overall fault isolation and repair sequence.andP;  The computer canprovide the appropriate documentation at the right stage in the operation.andO;It can also help in managing the maintenance organization by keeping track ofwhat procedures have been done when and by whom.andP;  And the software thatpresents the documentation can even interface with diagnostic computers onthe system being serviced to help pinpoint the problem.andM;This goes far beyond what we are used to thinking of as &quot;documentation.&quot;andO;There is clearly great potential for increased efficiency and reducedlikelihood of error.andP;  The key is to develop systems that maintain a singleunified database supporting the maintenance technician, the documentationauthors, and the logistics community of which they are part.andM;Coding for the future.andP;  Yuri Rubinsky of SoftQuad gave his audience a singlerule: &quot;Do not build your information empire on ancient 1987 technology.&quot;andO;(Or, we would add, on 1989 or even 1991 technology either.)andP;  Yourapplications will outlive your computers, he said.andP;  They will outlive yourchoice of PDL, your carefully selected software, and your screen or paperrepresentations too.andP;  None of these is a solid foundation on which to build.andM;Although you cannot anticipate future publishing requirements andtechnologies, you can plan to recycle information.andP;  The best way to do thisis to store your information in a standardized way, independent of anyparticular technology or presentation method.andM;Rubinsky suggested that SGML is the standard format that does the best job ofachieving this objective.andP;  Not only has SGML been adapted to handle a widevariety of document types, as its inventors intended, it is also porovingflexible enough to be used to encode music (including timing information forsynthetic performance) and hypertext--applications that probably were notforeseen.andP;  There is a great deal of flexibility built into SGML.andP;  As the U.S.andO;Defense Department (in the CALS initiative) and other publishers and usersare finding out, standards--and SGML in particular--are the appropriatefoundation on which to build.andM;Rubinsky concluded with a quote from the architect Le Corbusier: &quot;A standardis necessary for order in human effort.&quot;andP;  Or, as Rubinsky put it, &quot;Onceyou've agreed on the standards, then the fun begins.&quot;andM;When no standard exists, make one.andP;  Most existing documents, of course,adhere to no particular standard, and that is the situation that Joe Jaynesof Apollo addressed in his presentation.andP;  He held up his company's KnowledgeBroker product as a practical approach to bringing order to the chaos ofcompeting document types that typifies most corporate environments.andM;In the long run, it may be possible to retrieve information from databases ofSGML-compliant documents, but in the meantime, there are significant benefitsto be gained by simply putting existing documents into electronic form andoffering the user a tool to get at those documents without leaving the desk.andO;Jaynes described Apollo's Knowledge Broker, which is covered in detail underexhibits.andM;HypertextandM;One promising avenue of paperless information management and delivery ishypertext, which was mentioned in many of the presentations.andP;  It was alsofeatured in the exhibits of Apollo and Interleaf.andM;Electronic courseware.andP;  Daniel Alonso from Cornell University MedicalCollege, in an intriguing presentation, showed how his group at Cornell istrying to help medical students master the enormous amounts of basicinformation presented to them in the first two years of medical school.andO;Hypertext is being employed as a mechanism for teaching this information.andM;The background for the Cornell project is the changing role of the textbookin medical education during the last decade or two.andP;  Instead of learningprimarily from textbooks, the students learn primarily from lectures.andP;  Thetextbooks are  impossibly comprehensive.andP;  Thousands of pages are devoted toeach subject, and it is impossible to read it all and still keep up theschoolwork.andP;  So the textbooks are treated as reference tools and used toprovide extra detail when needed.andP;  The basics are covered in lectures.andO;Students team up with each other, taping and transcribing lectures andsharing the resulting transcripts.andP;  These lectures and transcripts serve asthe main educational medium.andM;At Cornell, the medical school has been working on supplementing this apprachwith a computer-based hypertext system.andP;  In 1985, it established aMacintosh-based project for teaching pathology called PathMac.andP;  In 1987, theproject began using hypertext software (Owl International's Guide system) andbecame known as HyperPath.andP;  It also began to cover other subjects in additionto pathology.andP;  The project currently employs 18 Macintoshes with SuperMaccolor monitors.andM;Alonso demonstrated the current status of HyperPath on a projection screen.andO;The basic screen layout contains an index window at the upper right.andP;  Thishas a scrolling, searchable list of about 600 key terms used in pathology.andO;Clicking on any term causes a page of explanation to appear at the left.andM;Various links appear in the text.andP;  By clicking on a colored icon in the text,you can open an image window that displays a picture illustrating the subjectof the text.andP;  Underlining of a word or phrase indicates the presence of adiagram, again available via a mouse click.andP;  Diagrams contain label points:when you click on one of these, a descriptive label appears.andM;At various points there are links to more detailed material.andP;  This may be apassage from a standard textbook, or it may be a reference to an article inthe current literature.andM;Question-and-answer links are also present.andP;  By clicking on these, you canadminister a self-test, The system presents multiple-choice answers, and ifyou select the wrong one, it presents you with a passage in the text windowwhich explains why the answer is wrong.andP;  There is also question-and-answerpractice available with pictures of various tissue samples (important forlearning pathology).andM;The system has been very well received by students.andP;  In addition topathology, it has been extended to include other subjects such as anatomy,physiology and neurology.andP;  Alonso expects substantial changes in thecurriculum to follow.andP;  He says that the current rote-learning approach in thefirst two years of medical school leaves students ill-prepared when theybegin dealing with patients in the third year.andP;  The problem-solving skillsthey need are not being taught.andP;  With HyperPath, the professor can let themachine present the basic principles, and class time can be devoted tohigher-level problem-solving.andM;The system is confined to Cornell so far, but other schools are veryinterested.andP;  The initial input of text for the system was student-transcribedlecture notes.andP;  Cornell is asking for permission to include published (andcopyrighted) material from various standard texts.andP;  The development of thesystem may turn into a collaborative venture: certain schools may take responsibility for developing curricula in specific subjects.andP;  Alonsoestimates that two or three years will be required before the system will bemature enough for wide distribution.andM;HyperCard &quot;textbook.&quot;andP;  Tyler Peppel of Apple also demonstrated a novelteaching application of hypertext.andP;  In this case, the software was based onApple's HyperCard, and the product was a multimedia teaching program from ABCcalled &quot;The Vote 1988.&quot;andP;  This is a package consisting of a videodisc and acompanion HyperCard stack (program).andP;  To use the package, which is availablefor sale for $295, you would need a minimum configuration of a Macintosh SE,HyperCard software, and an interfaced videodisc player.andM;&quot;The Vote 1988&quot; is a set of ABC news clips on videodisc from the 1988presidential campaign and election, with related material on the HyperCarddisk.andP;  On side 1 of the videodisc are video sequences related to thecampaigns and nominating conventions; side 2 has election night coverage andresults.andP;  Extracts of campaign speeches, debates, and the candidates' TV adsare available for analysis and comparison.andM;Via the HyperCard interface, the user controls the videodisc player.andP;  In asequence from the presidential debates, Peppel demonstrated how one canreview the expression on Bentsen's face as Quayle compares his experience tothat of John Kennedy prior to assuming the presidency.andP;  The package not onlygives you the ability to review the material on the videodisc; it alsoprovides tools for piecing together your own sequence out of any of theavailable clips.andP;  You can view the election results as numbers or on a U.S.andO;map with the states colored according to the vote tally.andM;Both the Apple and Cornell projects point to the coming of age of practicalhypertext: Cornell's HyperPath is successfully educating medical students,and &quot;The Vote 1988&quot; is (according to Peppel) making money for ABC.andM;SimulationandM;Hypertext may be coming of age as a publishing technology, but simulation hasyet to have much impact in this field.andP;  At least that's the impression givenby the three speakers who focused on simulation.andP;  Nevertheless, it is clearthat many things are better learned by experience than through being toldabout them, and as a result some publishers will undoubtedly turn tosimulation in the future as an alternative presentation medium.andM;Simulation basics.andP;  John Chisholm of the John Chisholm Company described thebasics of simulation.andP;  There are three basic steps in simulation.andP;  First, youbuild a computer model (a program) of the thing you want to model.andP;  (Thisstep requires lots of work by the user in developing the programs ordescriptions.)andP;  Second, you run the model.andP;  (This often requires lots ofcomputer horsepower).andP;  Third, you examine the results.andP;  (Since this istypically a visual process, it usually requires lots of graphics processing.)andM;Various computer architectures can be used for simulation.andP;  A common approachis to run the simulation on a shared supercomputer but to display the resultson a workstation.andP;  However, the large volume of graphics which must betransferred from the supercomputer to the workstation can create a networkbottleneck.andP;  This can be avoided by running the simulation locally, using alarge processor that can be built into the workstation.andP;  (This makes it a&quot;superworkstation.&quot;)  However, this processing power may often sit idle.andO;Several display workstations can be added to the superworkstation to shareits processor, giving the system an architecture analogous to the traditionaltime-sharing computer.andM;Applications.andP;  Chisholm ran through a series of application examples fromengineering (e.g., automobile crash simulation), manufacturing (assembly-linesimulation), science (weather prediction), aesthetics (architecturalwalk-throughs), and business (corporate strategy testing).andP;  The hard part, hesaid, is developing the programs and models.andP;  A variety of approaches areavailable, and it takes an expert to explain why one is better than anotherin a given case.andP;  For this reason, development of simulations will continueto be the domain of experts for many applications.andM;The principles of simulation are often found in other types of programming.andO;Expert systems are a special case of simulation.andP;   So are spreadsheets.andM;The ultimate limit on the accuracy of many simulations is chaos:unpredictable behavior of the model due to sensitive dependence on initialconditions.andP;  Turbulent flows are chaotic--and therefore eventuallyunpredictable--in this way.andP;  That is why, in Chisholm's view, long-rangeweather forecasting will never be really accurate.andP;  But even chaotic systemshave some predictability, if you are willing to settle for probabilitiesrather than certainties.andM;Norman Miller of Next, Inc. and Mike Liebhold of Apple Computer followedChisholm with a call for new tools for creating, editing and publishingsimulations.andP;  The hardware necessary to support interactive simulations(50-100 million floating-point operations per second, a photorealisticdisplay, high-quality audio, motion and tactile feedback, etc.) will soon beavailable in desktop computers that students and professionals use every day.andO;Students of chemistry will be able to interact with 3D models of molecules.andO;Architects will be able to design, then walk through, simulated buildings.andO;Medical students will try out surgical techniques and diagnostic proceduresinteractively, in a setting where they can learn from their mistakesharmlessly.andP;  Set designers and choreographers will be able to visualizealternative versions of their works.andP;  Farmers will be able to forecast cropsbetter.andP;  And there will be a range of hobbies that can be explored on-screen:sailing, designing and building a backyard deck, or exploring the results ofvarious landscaping schemes after a few years of growth.andM;In short, we will move from static to cinematic computing; from linearknowledge to hyper-knowledge; from discrete computing to distributedtelecomputing; and (due to burgeoning access to databases) from data-poor todata-rich computing.andP;  But the consensus of the speakers was that few of usare ready to take advantage of simulation.andM;As Liebhold described it, simulation is a tool to explore things that are toofast, slow, big, small, complex, dangerous, or expensive to be done in reallife.andP;  To exploit the potential of simulation, we'll need a higher level ofinteractive media literacy.andP;  Teachers and software producers--and then all ofus as end users--will have to learn to deal with a new set of tools that arestill beyond the horizon.andM;ExhibitsandM;In this section, we will first describe Apollo's Knowledge Broker, aretrieval tool that is used internally by Apollo but is being made availableas a commercial product.andP;  This tool will be offered to software developersand users alike, and so they are likely to find broad application, not justin publishing but in any application that uses computer technology.andP;  It isworth noting that Sun (the 386i Browser) and DEC (DEC Bookreader) aredeveloping similar technology into their platforms.andM;Following that description, we examine retrieval and hypertext software fromInterleaf, Northern Telecom, Scribe and Verity, respectively.andM;One general note: aside from Scribe, the following products are meant forretrieving &quot;published&quot; documents--that is, those that are in static form.andO;The use of hypertext links refers to a means of navigating freely about thedocument database; it is thus a different use of hypertext capabilities thanin HyperCard or Scribe's KMS, which are products for working with revisableinformation.andM;ApolloandM;Apollo's Knowledge Broker was one of the more innovative new productsintroduced at the Seminars.andP;  It is a tool for  delivering and retrievingpublished documents electronically that combines a hypertext-like interfacewith a previewing facility, which Apollo demonstrated using Interleafdocuments.andP;  Knowledge Broker was conceived by Apollo's documentation group asa better means of retrieving the 600-plus documents that form its current setof workstation and software manuals.andP;  The idea was to replicate the indexingand contents tools and browsing ease associated with books.andP;  As with books,the documents retrieved are static, and information can only be copied ontoanother document.andP;  But in a large library, locating the proper reference to atopic among 600-odd manuals is often a chore.andP;  In Knowledge Broker, theindexes and contents of all of the manuals are combined; the search enginelocates documents from anywhere on the network, without the user having toknow their location; and the hypertext links provide a non-sequentialnavigational tool--all of which are advantages over the paper-based treasurehunt that characterized Apollo's past method of finding information.andM;Retrieving documents.andP;  Theoretically, Knowledge Broker is a single retrievalmechanism for retrieving information from any publishing application.andP;  Apolloselected Interleaf to  demonstrate how third-party applications would beintegrated because it uses Interleaf itself.andP;  But the product currentlysupports raw ASCII and troff formatted files, and the hook to the applicationsoftware--the display module interface--is designed to encourage third-partydevelopers to adapt their programs to Knowledge Broker without changing theformat of their data.andM;A file being prepared for retrieval is first indexed using Apollo's ownfull-text inverted indexing routine.andP;  This process generates an invertedindex of all of the words in the document (excluding pronouns, articles andso forth).andP;  A second step is to create a table of contents within KnowledgeBroker.andP;  This is a hierarchical representation of the structure of thedocument (volumes, chapters, sections, etc.) with direct links to the pagesof the document.andM;Once a file is stored within Knowledge Broker, it is added to the list ofavailable documents that may be searched.andP;  Any user on the network can locateinformation within the document, regardless of where the user is logged onand where the document is stored on the network.andM;The user interface is straightforward.andP;  Searches may be on the index,contents or reference list, which is a personal list of documents you referto frequently.andP;  The user constrains each type of search by selecting thedocuments to include from the list of those available within KnowledgeBroker.andM;Index searches are aided by the use of a synonym dictionary, which makes itpossible to locate documents that discuss a topic but do not actually containthe word(s) selected.andP;  Searches may include phrases, but there are no Booleanoperators at this time.andM;When the search is complete, Knowledge Broker reports how many documentmatches were found and lists the matches in a directory.andP;  From the directory,the search may be further refined, or any of the documents retrieved to thedisplay.andP;  Text strings that match the search criteria are highlighted in thedocument, and the program automatically takes you to the first occurrencewhen it opens up the document.andM;The retrieved file is actual pages that may be scrolled vertically insequence as if the pages of a book were wrapped around a cylinder that youturn through the scroll bar.andM;If the number of hits was too large, the search may be refined, butunfortunately, Knowledge Broker reinitiates the entire search process ratherthan searching only those documents already found.andP;  This is one enhancementthat would improve response times in a large retrieval environment.andM;The second means of retrieval is the contents.andP;  By opening the contents ofany document, the user can simply go to a section of pages by double-clickingon the section's name.andP;  All of the pages of that section are loaded forviewing.andP;  Various layers of the contents (e.g., show only level 1 and level 2headings) may be selected for display.andM;Within a retrieved document, the user may search for specific text strings,display an outline of the document, step forward or backward through thedirectory, print the file, add it to the reference list, go to the link menuor select and copy text to a buffer for pasting into another document.andM;Hyperlinks.andP;  The Link menu is used to insert hypertext links within aKnowledge Broker document.andP;  A link automatically opens an associated documentwhen it is activated.andP;  The link itself is part of Knowledge Broker; no codingis inserted in the source or display files.andM;Links are like cross-references in a traditional book index, except that theytake you directly to the associated information, rather than to anotherreference in the index.andP;  Any number of links may be inserted within a singledocument.andP;  The system will show upon request a list of any available linkswithin a document.andP;  Links may be private or public; only those available tothe user are shown.andM;Publisher's Toolkit.andP;  For those who want to deliver informationelectronically, as well as retrieve it, Apollo provides the Publisher'sToolkit, an option for preparing documents that can be retrieved in KnowledgeBroker.andM;The kit includes copyright-protection provisions that prevent KnowledgeBroker users from copying protected information.andP;  One nice aspect of the kitis that information can still remain in its native format, as long as thepublisher makes use of the Knowledge Broker display interface.andP;  (Thespecification is available from Apollo.) (One source document, for example,may be used to create both hard-copy and Knowledge Broker pages.)andP;  Apollo'sdocumentation group is using the Toolkit to deliver Apollo manualselectronically.andM;Knowledge Broker will be available next month from Apollo.andP;  In single copies,the viewing software is list priced at $550 per workstation.andP;  Volume pricing,by network licenses, is expected to lower the price to about $200 perworkstation.andP;  A Publisher's Toolkit Option costs $1,500.andM;Assessment.andP;  Knowledge Broker is the first graphic retrieval engine from aplatform vendor, and it is an excellent first effort.andP;  Its use of Apollo'sNCS to locate information anywhere on the net--and to use parallel processingto search multiple locations simultaneously--show how powerful electronicretrieval will be compared to hunting down a book that sits in someone'soffice (if only you knew whose).andM;Using the program is simple and reasonably efficient.andP;  Knowledge Brokerdoesn't attempt to deal with information that is not in published form, andwe think the retrieval mechanism could still be improved, but in concept andexecution, the product is a prime example of application software that isbest provided at the platform level and therefore made accessible to thepublishing user no matter what third-party software is being employed.andM;We hope other platform vendors will take their cues from Knowledge Broker andconsider offering similar retrieval engines.andM;InterleafandM;Interleaf demonstrated its Viewstation 4.0 software, including new hypertextcapabilities to be included in the next release.andP;   These were shown with aprototype of Interleaf's Optical Publishing System, or OPS.andP;  (OPS should notbe confused with the original Interleaf Office Publishing Software, which hasbeen supplanted by WPS and TPS.)andP;  OPS will offer Interleaf's customers avehicle for publishing on electronic media, such as CD-ROM discs, and throughHyperView and Viewstation software, a mechanism for retrieving informationdelivered in electronic form.andM;There were two parts to the optical publishing system prototype.andP;  First waspreparing the information for online dissemination; second was the actualretrieval of documents.andM;Delivering electronically.andP;  Although no formal product agreement has beenreached, Interleaf has licensed Fulcrum's full-text indexing and retrievalengine to disseminate Interleaf documents electronically in the OPSprototype.andM;Typical applications include parts catalogs, repair manuals and otherdocuments used by sales and support staff out in the field.andP;  The fieldorganization would use laptop PCs with built-in CD-ROM drives; the companywould deliver the new manuals on a CD-ROM with all necessary software.andM;The source document is formatted in Printerleaf, Interleaf's page descriptionlanguage, and then written out as an ASCII file that Fulcrum can read.andO;Information that is not text (graphics and images) is ignored by Fulcrum, buttext within microdocuments and graphics (such as art labels) is stillindexed.andP;  In addition, Interleaf tokens, such as its indexing tokens, arewritten out in ASCII as part of the Printerleaf file.andP;  In its implementation,Interleaf had Fulcrum recognize these tokens so that when files areretrieved, the index tokens become hot buttons for hypertext links.andM;The retrieval software, key-word index and Printerleaf source file are thenmastered on a CD-ROM for duplication and distribution.andP;  Each site uses theretrieval software (described below) to locate information and retrievecomposed documents.andM;HyperView--retrieving documents.andP;  HyperView is an extension of Viewstation4.0 software, which runs on any AT-compatible PC.andP;  With Viewstation, userscan retrieve and view Interleaf-formatted documents as they look on TPS.andP;  Theonly difference between the products is that you can only view the document,not edit it, in Viewstation.andM;HyperView takes Viewstation one step further by providing both sequential andnonsequential access to documents.andP;  Sequential access enables the user tostep forward or backward through a document.andP;  But using the index tokens ashot buttons, HyperView enables the user to call up a file directly from theindex reference.andM;Functions available within HyperView include annotation of notes to documentsor directories and printing of hardcopy on an IBM Proprinter or PostScriptprinters.andP;  Notes are appended to the source file.andP;  Any number of notes may beput in one file.andP;  All notes are public to those who have permission to seethe document.andM;The indexing of text within graphics and the ability to embed hypertext linkswithin graphics are key advantages of Interleaf's approach, because itenables the user to locate references to a topic within illustrations as wellas text.andP;  In many online applications (service manuals, for example),retrieving graphics is essential to getting the entire story (such as how tofix a broken part).andM;Another advantage is the automatic creation of the hypertext links.andP;  UnlikeKnowledge Broker, in which links are created manually, HyperView builds thelinks for you from the source document's index.andP;  This enables the creator ofthe document to build the cross-references as the document is being written.andM;One restriction, however, is the inability to later add your own links, suchas you might do in Knowledge Broker.andP;  Such a feature would enable theHyperView user to embed cross references that the creator had not thought of.andO;A second  restriction is that HyperView only works with documents inInterleaf format, whereas Knowledge Broker is designed to handle multipleoutput formats.andM;Working across platforms.andP;  Implementing advanced features like hypertextacross multiple platforms is no mean feat, but Interleaf has a feasiblestrategy: it will offer its Viewstation application porogramming interface tothe platform vendor, which can use the interface to invoke Interleafdocuments to the screen.andP;  Both Sun (in the 386i Browser) and Apollo(Knowledge Broker) are already making use of this facility.andP;  The retrievalapplication is different from Interleaf's, but all use the same underlyingtechnology to render the document on the screen.andM;Viewstation 4.0 software is available today.andP;  The hypertext extensions areforthcoming in the next release, due out sometime this year.andP;  The OpticalPublishing System prototype is being delivered to two sites this year;inquiries should be directed to Interleaf's Systems Integration group, whichprovides custom solutions to Interleaf customers.andM;Northern Telecom/DMRandM;Northern Telecom and DMR exhibited the Compass document-retrieval softwarethey jointly developed.andP;  It is described in our coverage of the NorthernTelecom/DMR seminar presentation, earlier in this section (see p. 18).andP;  Thecompanies are interested in licensing the technology they developed to otherswith a need for electronic documentation.andM;Northern Telecom, Inc., Northern Telecom Plaza, 200 Athens Way, Nashville, TN37228-1803; phone 615-734-2692.andM;DMR Group, Inc., 57 River Street, Wellesley Hills, MA 02181; phone 617237-0087.andM;Scribe SystemsandM;We recently described Scribe's Knowledge Management System (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andO;12).andP;  That system, on its own, is a self-contained hypertext system with goodpotential for publishing applications.andP;  But it can serve as the &quot;glue&quot; for afar larger system, one that incorporates bits and pieces produced with avariety of hardware and software products.andP;  When it is used in this way, theScribe product is called STEPS (Scribe Technical Electronic PublishingSystem).andM;STEPS was demonstrated at the Seminars.andP;  At its top level, it looks identicalto KMS.andP;  But as you move downward through the document &quot;tree,&quot; you encounterreferences to documents that are not part of KMS.andP;  These take the form of thestatement &quot;@external&quot; followed by a path name describing where the documentmay be found.andP;  The @external statements can link SGML, MacWrite, WordPerfect,Multimate, Smart, Ventura Publisher, and Interleaf files into an overalldocument managed by STEPS.andM;To convert these pieces into a common format for publishing, STEPS usesspecial software modules.andP;  The files are converted into an internal genericintermediate format.andP;  That format can then be translated into commands forthe target document-production system (typically Scribe or Interleaf).andP;  Thesoftware used for these conversions is derived from that used by anotherScribe subsidiary, Lexeme, to convert programs from one programming languageto another.andP;  The conversions are controlled by a set of user-modifiablespecification files.andP;  These tell the system how to derive document structurefrom the formatting commands (e.g., that a 24-point centered head in a givendocument is a chapter title).andM;For now, STEPS is primarily oriented toward preparing documents for output.andO;But Scribe is adding features to support capturing documents in KMS format.andO;Document structure and cross-references will be preserved in the KMSenvironment as hypertext links.andP;  Then, KMS could be used to view and modifythe full document.andP;  (However, update control could be tricky if the documentcontinued to exist on the source system.)andM;VerityandM;Full-text retrieval systems, of which Topic is an example, have been aroundfor many years.andP;  They all allow searches based on boolean combinations ofwords, word-stems, or phrases.andP;  Full-text systems often fail to producesatisfactory results because of two kinds of problems: they miss somerelevant documents (because they don't contain the exact terms specified inthe query) and they come up with many extraneous documents (because the queryterms may have broad usage outside the subject the requestor is interestedin).andP;  Verity has a new method of addressing these potential shortcomings.andM;Some systems address the first problem (missing relevant documents) byincorporating a thesaurus of synonyms.andP;  Documents are retrieved if theyinclude the requested term or a synonym, which reduces the likelihood ofmissing a pertinent document.andP;  Tyupically, these systems address the secondproblem (extraneous &quot;hits&quot;) by allowing the user to refine the request afterviewing the initial results, and by allowing successful queries to be storedfor later use.andM;Verity has combined elements of both the thesaurus and the stored search intoa clever system for finding the relevant documents in a large database.andO;Generally, when you use a full-text system you are searching for materialrelated to a specific concept or group of concepts.andP;  Verity lets youconstruct &quot;topics&quot; (branching hierarchies of terms), which are a direct wayof describing the concept that you are interested in.andP;  The topic treesdescribe how various related terms are grouped and how much weight should begiven to each in making a retrieval.andP;  These trees can be saved for use infuture retrievals.andM;One of the databases on the Topic demonstration system containedinternational news stories.andP;  Verity showed how stories dealing with terrorismcould be extracted from it--including stories in which the word &quot;terrorism&quot;does not appear.andP;  Terrorism was set up as a topic with subtopic(Terrorism--Actors, Terrorism--Events, Terrorism--Targets, andTerrorism--Devices).andP;  These were further subdivided.andP;  For example,Terrorism--Devices was divided into Explosives, Car-Bomb, and Gun.andP;  Thesubdivisions continue until they reach the level of single, searchable wordsor phrases.andP;  At each level, the user can provide &quot;weights&quot; indicating howimportant to the parent item each of the subordinate items is.andM;The various braches of the topic tree can carry &quot;weights&quot; indicating howimportant to the concept that particular branch is.andP;  The weights are used inranking the retrieved documents by relevance.andP;  The system is capable ofmonitoring a stream of incoming data (a wire service, for example) fordocuments that match standing retrieval criteria.andP;  It can also work across networks, and it can work with documents created by a wide variety ofsoftware packages.andM;The ability to contruct and store concept trees strikes us as a valuable one.andO;It is especially valuable if the user is a subject-matter specialist, ratherthan a generalist (such as a reference librarian).andP;  A specialist would beable to construct and refine concept trees for the basic concepts of his orher specialty.andP;  These could be combined in various searches as needed, andthey could be used to monitor incoming data from newswires and similarsources.andM;Verity is selling Topic directly to large organizations and is also sellingit as an OEM component in other people's offerings, including CD-ROMservices.andP;  Topic is targeted toward multi-user network installations, and thepricing reflects this: though options will vary, the basic package costs$15,000 plus $695 per terminal or workstation.andP;  It runs on Macs,PC-compatibles, and Unix workstations.andM;Verity, Inc., 1550 Plymouth, Mountain View, CA 94043-1230;
