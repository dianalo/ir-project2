The growthof 5.1% was achieved in the non-oil sections. The labor population increasedto 4,450,000 in 1984 from 3,030,000 in 1979 along the continuous growthof domestic economy. The expanded economic scale required the labor populationfrom foreign countries that exceeds the domestic labor power, resultingin relative failure of the Saudization. The main industrial projectsare the oil refinery project by Petromin, a government operated oil company,and the SABIC petrochemical project. (2 figs, 15 tabs, 7 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
