N/sub m/F/sub 2/ and dNe/dh minima at 100 and 240 degof the longitudes are alternated with maxima of these values at 160 and320 deg of the longitudes. These variations can be explained by the variationsof the vertical electrodynamic drift obviously related to the changesin electric fields at the equator.</TEXT></DOC>
