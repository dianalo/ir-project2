Cooler weather helped firefighters in Oregon and SouthernCalifornia and crews contained Washington's only major blaze. Butofficials feared lightning could trigger a new round of fires likethe ones that have been burning since the middle of last week.   Waves of thunderheads caused an estimated 2,000 lightningstrikes an hour early Tuesday in Idaho's Boise National Forestalone. The thunderstorms let up later and there was no immediateword of any new fires.   About 1,200 soldiers from Fort Lewis, Wash., were to beginheading to lines in southeastern Oregon today after getting aone-day crash course in cutting containment lines, fort spokesmanGeorge Polich said.   In addition, four 20-man crews and three helicopters were tohead to Oregon and Idaho today after an 850-acre fire in northernWashington was contained.   The Boise Interagency Fire Center said about 20,000 firefighterswere on lines in the West, primarily in Idaho, Oregon andCalifornia. Blazes have blackened more than 175,000 acres in thosestates and Washington.   Some of the firefighters came from as far away as Florida. IdahoGov. Cecil Andrus said the influx was obvious at Chicago's O'HareAiport, where he waited Monday to return from the NationalGovernors' Conference.   ``I saw nothing but green pants, yellow shirts and the boots offirefighters headed West,'' he said.   More than 5,000 firefighters battled uncontained fires on morethan 80,000 acres of Idaho range and timber. Andrus predicted thefight could rage for a month.   Payette National Forest officials evacuated 16 of the 36residents of Warren, a small mining town 120 miles north of Boise,as flames from the 1,000-acre Whangdoodle Fire moved to within amile of town.   ``We're telling them we feel like they're in some danger andoffering to help them evacuate,'' Payette spokesman GeorgeBukenhofer said.   Crews carved a break line south of the town with bulldozers andused pumps to wet the area ahead of the fire, which was shootingembers two miles ahead of the flames.   About 100 miles to the southeast, fires that burned on 26,000acres and destroyed more than $10 million in structures at Lowmanlast weekend turned back toward the town Tuesday evening. More than1,100 firefighters armed with 60 water engines, tankers and twobulldozers worked to protect the town.   Boise National Forest officials evacuated about two dozen peoplefrom cabins just west of the town to a campground three miles away.They also evacuated two lodges outside the town, although SourdoughLodge owner Bob Ahern said he would resist the efforts of sheriff'sdeputies to get him out.   ``They keep coming to the door to get me, and I keep tellingthem I lost my keys,'' he said. ``They can ask me to leave, butthey can't force me.''   About 40 miles north of Boise, a rejuvenated 5,000-acre firejumped the South Fork of the Payette River near Banks, andbillowing smoke closed Idaho Highway 55 temporarily, Bukenhofersaid.   Helicopters crisscrossed the Hell's Canyon area near theIdaho-Oregon line, carrying rangers who brought maps to directabout 40 hikers to the safest routes out of the backcountry.   In eastern Oregon, where 80,000 acres have burned, cooler, moistweather today helped crews cut lines around a 10,300-acre fire nearthe town of John Day and fight blazes around Baker and Enterprise.   Firefighters hoped they could turn back several big timber andrange blazes, said Forest Service spokeswoman Wendy Evans. Severalsmaller blazes were contained, and the spread of the bigger fireshad stopped, she said.   In California, more than 1,300 firefighters aided by six airtankers and four helicopters struggled in steep canyons 90 milessoutheast of Los Angeles to encircle half of a fire that hasblackened 8,200 acres of century-old brush in the ClevelandNational Forest.   Sporadic winds hampered the battle, said Forest Servicespokeswoman Rosalinda Ewen. ``It was going in a variety ofdifferent directions,'' she said.   The fire, which has burned a home, a mobile home and a traveltrailer and forced the evacuation of 100 campers, was startedSaturday by a recreational shooter's ricocheting bullet. Threefirefighters were treated for minor injuries.   To the north in the Sierra Nevada foothills, firefighterscontained a blaze that burned 11,700 acres of brush and grasslandand destroyed seven homes.</TEXT></DOC>
