Computer Security is convinced that these technologiesdo in fact offer the &quot;key to the future&quot;, but also puts forward the somewhatapocalyptic view that without sufficient security measures they may wellbecome &quot;the key to crime and collapse&quot;.andP;  But then, a company dealing in theprovision of data integrity and security software would say that, wouldn'tit?andM;ScaremongeringandM;Managing director Jim Foord, however, is anxious to deny categorically anyaccusations of scaremongering, and claims that he could give many examples ofbreaches in data integrity were it not for the fact that his clients quitenaturally like to shroud their misadventures in a cloak of secrecy.andP;  Like oneof the Big Four High Street banks, which some years ago was rumoured to havetaken no action against an &quot;electronic fraudster&quot; in return for a detailedaccount of how the #750,000 theft was carried out, so that customers - andpotential criminals - were kept in the dark about how insecure the wholesystem was; or like the senior executive of an anonymous multinational whoselaptop went missing one day - the loss was immediately reported to ComputerSecurity, which subsequently took on the company as a client, but Foord saysthat to this day he still has not been told what information the laptopcontained, and who would have been interested in it.andP;  Aside from the moresensational reports of data crime, such as the recent case of deliberatedissemination of a computer virus, it is certain that data crime does exist,and with the move towards more distributed processing power, theopportunities for its increasingly artful exponents will duly become moreplentiful.andP;  Computer Security's software design is based on the premise thatno code designed to ensure data integrity as it passes from A to B isimpossible to crack - the idea is to set up such a large number ofcombinations that decryption would take so long as to be impracticable.andP;  -andM;By Mark JohnandM;To give a measure of the time-periods involved, Foord reckons that one of itstop level codes would require eight years' processing on a Cray 1supercomputer to crack.andP;  The Computer Security range of hardware and softwareproducts for personal computers to mainframes has recently been supplementedby that of Redwood City, California-based RSA Data Security Inc, whoseproducts it is now marketing in Europe.andP;  Computer Security explained that theeffectivenes of RSA's encryption software is based on the difficulty offactorising prime numbers - which may sound like a conjurer explaining onetrick by performing another.andP;  For the benefit of the dazed journalistspresent, an analogy was given to explain how the Massachusettes Institute ofTechnology-developed RSA system handles the encryption and decryption ofelectronic signatures, which like written signatures establish the origin andauthority of a message.andP;  Imagine a company that wants to send classifiedinformation to a number of parties over a wire.andP;  In the analogy, this companyis provided with an English-to-Sanscrit dictionary - the only one in theworld, and belonging uniquely to that company.andP;  The signature, which may becomposed of a number of elements, is translated into Sanscrit and sent to theappropriate parties, each of whom has a Sanscrit to English dictionary.andP;  Inthis way, they can convert the signature back to English, but in order toreproduce the original Sanscrit signature, they would need to go through thewhole of their one-way dictionary to translate each element - a virtuallyinsuperable task.andP;  In the RSA Key Cryptosystem, the English-to-Sanscritdictionary corresponds to the &quot;private key&quot;, used uniquely by that company tosign the document, while the Sanscrit-to-English dictionary relates to the&quot;public key&quot; that is freely distributed so that recipients can check theauthenticity of the document received.andP;  RSA's Public Key Cryptosystem, likeComputer Security's SafeGuard products, have found their market largely inthe banking and fin-ancial sectors, but both expect the commercial sector toget more interested in view of the technological developments mentionedearlier.andP;  In the last few days, RSA has finally clinched a deal with the USDepartment of Defense to use the Cryptosystem in support of the US governmentProtection of Logistics Unclassified Sensitive Data - PLUS - programme, andmore good news came as the RSA software - which uses object-orientedtechniques in the C and C++ languages - was recently endorsed as a standardwithin the 600,000 user US Internet network that was the victim of the virusunleashed by Robert Morris - now convicted and awaiting sentence; it is alsobeing put forward for ratification by the Consultative Committee onTelegraphy and Telephony as a European standard.andM;Lotus NotesandM;Apart from distribution by Computer Security, RSA software is also sold OEMby firms including DEC, Motorola and Lotus Development, which has recentlyannounced the Notes package incorporating RSA's BSAFE system.andP;  ComputerSecurity does around #4m and #5m business a year and was saved four years agoby venture capitalists Advent, which, along with Legal andamp; General andCommercial Union, is a major shareholder in the concern.andP;  It presently sellsvia its own dealers, but Foord says that in the future it may be looking toengineer licence deals similar to those of its new US trading partner.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
