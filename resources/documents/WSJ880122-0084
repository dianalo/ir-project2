The Quebec-owned power utility was licensed to export as much as 50,000 kilowatt-hours of uninterruptible power to a group of nine Vermont utilities over a 32-month period, beginning March 1.    A spokeswoman for the National Energy Board, the regulatory agency, said the contract represented a little less than 12 million Canadian dollars ($9.3 million) in annual revenue for Hydro-Quebec.    The board is expected to decide soon on a much larger Hydro-Quebec contract, providing as much as 70 billion kwh of energy to 93 New England utilities over a 10-year period. </TEXT></DOC>
