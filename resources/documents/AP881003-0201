RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court, studying whether states mayuse anti-racketeering laws to close down adult bookstores, was toldMonday by an Indiana prosecutor that a key part of that state's lawmay be invalid.   Stephen Goldsmith of Indianapolis, prosecuting attorney forMarion County, conceded under questioning from the justices duringthe opening day of the new court term that some pre-trial seizuresof material may be unconstitutional.   But Goldsmith said the questionable nature of pre-trial seizuresshould not be a basis to throw out racketeering laws that areproviding a growing number of states with a powerful new weapon tofight obscenity and organized crime.   Invalidating such laws ``would provide a safe haven fororganized crime,'' Goldsmith said.   John H. Weston, a Beverly Hills, Calif., lawyer representingIndiana bookstore owners, said the racketeering laws pose a majorthreat to free speech.   ``A basic governing concept that has ennobled the country'shistory is that anyone may not lose the right of speaking byspeaking,'' he said.   Weston said laws like the one in Indiana not only threaten booksellers but also abridge ``the American public's right to receivevast quantities of material.''   Indiana's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law,patterned after the much-used federal RICO act, authorizes lawenforcement officials to seize property used in a racketeeringenterprise.   The law was used in March 1984 against three Fort Waynebookstores selling sexually explicit materials. Each was accused ofat two least violations of the state's obscenity laws.   Authorities padlocked the stores and seized all inventory.Similar legal action was taken against three stores in Indianapolis_ although those store owners did not appeal to the Supreme Court.   The three Fort Wayne bookstores were allowed to reopen in April1985, but only one, Fort Wayne Books, remains in business. It filedone of the appeals that the Supreme Court agreed to study anddecide by July.   The justices also are reviewing a companion case in which theHoward County, Ind., sheriff's office charged Ronald Sappenfieldwith distributing obscene material and violating the state RICOlaw. The case has not yet gone to trial.   An Indiana appeals court ruled in June 1985 that applying thestate RICO law to those whose only offenses are alleged obscenityviolates free speech rights.   Padlocking bookstores accused but not convicted of sellingobscene material is impermissible ``prior restraint'' on freeexpression, the appeals court said.   But the Indiana Supreme Court in March 1987 reinstated the law.   During an hour's arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court onMonday, Goldsmith was pressed to explain why law enforcementofficials could seize a store's entire inventory of books based onas little as two sales of an osbcene book.   Justice John Paul Stevens said the law seems to brand thebookstore as a criminal enterprise that authorizes aninventory-wide seizure ``even if the rest of the store is filledwith nothing but Charles Dickens and William Shakespeare.''   Goldsmith said the law is designed to apply with equal force to,for example, drug dealers and smut peddlers. It would be ``nodifferent than if cocaine were sold twice,'' he said. The purposeis to prevent organized crime from shielding the proceeds ofillegal activities, he said.   While Goldsmith conceded that pre-trial seizures of bookstoreinventory may be unconstitutional, he argued that in the case ofFort Wayne Books the law enforcement activities were permissible.   He said the store was convicted 39 times previously of obscenityviolations.   Goldsmith also said that post-conviction seizures of bookstoresshould be permitted even if the high court invalidates pre-trialseizures.   The justices also quizzed Weston vigorously.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist questioned why someoneconvicted of obscenity violations should be protected from havingproperty seized any more than a drug dealer should enjoy thatsafeguard.   ``Peddling obscenity is not presumptively protected by the FirstAmendment,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
