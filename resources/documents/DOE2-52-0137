The value for the electrical quality factoris high enough for a system operating at 50 mK at a sensitivity levelof one phonon. The resonator's low damping properties make it suitablefor use as a transducer for a cryogenic three-mode gravitational radiationdetector. A practical design is given for the mounting of the resonatoron a 2400-kg aluminum-bar detector. Projections are made for the sensitivityof a 2400-kg bar instrumented as a three-mode system with this resonatorinductively coupled to a SQUID.</TEXT></DOC>
