Background</ITAG>The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) (42 U.S.C. 300th, <T3>et seq.</T3>) protects underground sources of drinking water (USDW)from contamination by injection wells. On of the cornerstones of the UndergroundInjection Control (UIC) program is the mechanical integrity of the wells.The regulations for the UIC program define mechanical integrity as theabsence of significant leaks in the casing, tubing or packer and the absenceof significant fluid movement into an underground source of drinking waterthrough vertical channels adjacent to the injection wellbore. Acceptablemethods of evaluating mechanical integrity for programs administered byEPA are specified in 40 CFR 146.8. In order to be approved, tests must``reliably demonstrate the mechanical integrity'' of wells for which theiruse is proposed. The regulations also provide that approved alternativemethods shall be published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and may be used in all States unless their useis restricted at the time of approval. The Director of the Office of DrinkingWater has been delegated the authority to approve alternative tests.On July 20, 1984, interim approval was granted for two years for the alternativemechanical integrity test known as the water-in-annulus test for the followingcounties of New York and Pennsylvania: Allegheny, Cattaraugus, and SteubenCounties in New York, and Elk, Forest, McKean, Potter, Venango, Warren,and Washington Counties in Pennsylvania (49 FR 29375). An extension ofthis interim approval was granted on July 14, 1987 (52 FR 26342) so thatnew testing procedures to conduct the test could be adopted for greateroperator consistency and to allow additional information to be collectedunder these new procedures to further analyze test results. In its reviewof information collected under these new procedures, EPA determined thatmore data was necessary to analyze the test's reliability and sensitivity.Therefore, on September 26, 1988 (53 FR 37296) EPA again extended the interimapproval for the water-in-annulus test until March 27, 1989, during whichtime the test's effectiveness, sensitivity, and reliability would be determinedfurther by comparing the water-in-annulus test with the existing approvedMIT pressure test.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Description of the Test</ITAG>Historically, Class II injection wells in certain areas of Pennsylvaniaand New York were commonly constructed without any casing extending allthe way from the top of the well to the injection zone at the bottom. Duringdrilling, the water sands down to about 500 feet were first cased off,usually with 7-inch outer diameter casing. This casing was later removedfrom many wells after completion. For wells in which casing remained, cementplaced behind the casing ranged from none in older wells, to complete fill-upin newer wells. Drilling then proceeded through intervening formationsto total depth. When the target injection zone was penetrated, injectiontubing (usually 2 in. O.D.) was run in with a packer on bottom and setagainst the formation just above the injection zone. Usually 10 sacks (about50 ft.) of cement are placed above the packer. Typically, to save expense,cement bond logs were not run in either casing or tubing. Final completionconsisted of stimulating the injection zone by acidizing and/or fracturingbefore water injection commenced, and then typically, 25-50 barrels perday (BPD) were injected.The water-in-annulus test, which measures the rate of change of the waterlevel in the annulus, was based on operators' observations (and later confirmedthrough contractor study and EPA Region II and III UIC staff observations)that in the majority of these wells, the annulus will retain a static waterlevel (near the surface) for days. This reflects the fact that the exposedformations (uncased) below the surface casing are so impermeable, theirrate of water absorption is almost negligible.To conduct the test, the operator fills the annulus of the wells with waterand observes the change in water level which occurs over a one-hour period;first with no injection pressure applied to the tubing and next with pressureapplied. If there is no change in water level in either case, it is clearthat:(a) There is no water absorption into exposed formations nor leak(s) insurface pipe to permeable beds; and (b) There is no leak in tubing, in the packer/cement combination or inthe formation immediately behind cement.If there is no change in water level without injection pressure, but arise in water level with injection pressure applied, then:(a) There is no leak into exposed formations and no leak in the surfacepipe; but (b) There is a leak in either the tubing/packer/cement combination or inthe formation behind cement.Under these conditions a leak of only 1 BPD would cause the water levelto rise at the rate of 1.3 feet/hour (for 2\3/4\ in. outer diameter tubingin 6\1/4\ in. inner diameter casing). A leak as small as 0.2 BPD, correspondingto a water level rise of 3 in./hr., would be detectable. Consequently,the test is very sensitive.If there is a drop in annular water level without tubing pressure applied,and a similar drop with injection pressure applied, then:(a) There is a small leak-off into exposed formation(s); or(b) A leak in surface casing; but(c) There is no leak in tubing packer-cement combination or formation behindcement.Distinguishing a leak in surface casing from a leak-off into an exposedformation is a difficult, but not unsolvable, problem. The use of a liner,seated between the casing and tubing, whose annulus then is filled withwater, can provide information as to whether the surface casing is leadingor the fluid decline is due to a leak-off into thief zones. Under staticconditions, if the test should document a decline in the fluid level dueto a hole in the surface casing, the consequence would be minimal sincethere would not be a continuous flow of water into the annulus and outthe hole in the surface casing (water was in the annulus only for testing).Once the decline in water level reaches equilibrium it will remain static.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Basis for Approval</ITAG>EPA initially approved this test after reviewing the findings of studyprepared by Dewan in 1983 for EPA Regions II and III that recommended thistest be used, after taking into account the following factors concerningthe well construction and geologic characteristics common to the countiesfor which the test is being proposed:(1) The past industry-wide use of two-inch injection tubing and other technicalconstraints have severely limited the availability of down-hole instrumentsfor either the emplacement of temporary plugs for pressure testing or welllogging;(2) In the shales below the lowermost undergound sources of drinking water,fractures are not apparent and experience has shown that these interveningshales are competent to support themselves in open-hole wells without longstring casing down to the oil-producing sandstones. The past industry-widepractice of completing enhanced oil recovery wells without long stringcasing has precluded the use of annulus pressure monitoring or testingbecause there is no cased annulus; and (3) Monitoring records, which would establish a historic baseline of thepressure-flow rate relationship, rarely exist.The test was initially approved on July 20, 1984 for a period of two yearsbecause theoretical analysis indicated that it had the necessary sensitivityfor leak detection, and because exposed formations were so impermeablethat they allowed a well to maintain a static water level sufficientlylong to perform the test. This interim approval was extended for an additionalyear, on July 14, 1987, in order for additional data to be collected andanalyzed under newly revised testing procedures developed to assure bettertesting consistency and to compare the results of this test with thoseof other established tests.EPA extended the interim approval on September 26, 1988, for an additionalsix months, in order to complete collection of comparative testing datato further establish the test's reliability and effectiveness.Review of the records of the water-in-annulus test over these past threeyears, plus the review of recently completed technical documents generatedthrough research conducted at EPA Robert S. Kerr Laboratory in Ada, Oklahoma,and the comparative testing conducted on existing wells in the Pennsylvaniaand New York oil fields, supports the conclusion that the water-in-annulustest can successfully demonstrate mechanical integrity. The comparativetesting showed that the proposed alternative water-in-annulus alternateMIT consistently yields the same result (either pass or fail) as the conventionalpressure test. The effectiveness of this test in determining a well's mechanicalintegrity was demonstrated under the conditions and locations indicatedin Technical Document No. 12.A complete listing of the technical documents used to assist in makingthe final determination for this test follow:(1) Technical Document Number 1: Region II Water-in-Annulus MIT resultsfrom the period October, 1987 through March, 1988.(2) Technical Document Number 2: Region III Water-in-Annulus MIT resultsfrom the period June, 1987 through March, 1988.(3) Technical Document Number 3: Breakout of test failures and their respectivepercentages in Regions II and III during the period June, 1987 throughMarch, 1988.(4) Technical Document Number 4: Breakout of inconclusive test resultsby rates of water level decline during the period June, 1987 through March,1988.(5) Technical Document Number 5: Interim report on the Water-in-AnnulusMIT results (June, 1984-December, 1985).(6) Technical Document Number 6: Volumetric calculations of annular fluidcontained within specified lengths of casing.(7) Technical Document Number 7: Calculation estimating size of hope incasing given pressures from varying hydrostatic head values in the annulus.(8) Technical Document Number 8: Report on leak detection analysis fromBradford, Pennsylvania research.(9) Technical Document Number 9: Report on leak detection analysis fromAda, Oklahoma research.

Special Conditions  </ITAG><T3>A. Limitations on the use of the Water-in-Annulus Mechanical Test IntegrityTest  </T3>Use of the water-in-annulus test is limited to existing Class II enhancedrecovery injection wells (existing wells are those wells which were inoperation prior to June 25, 1984) located in Allegheny, Cattaraugus, andSteuben Counties in New York and Elk, Forest, McKean, Potter, Venango,Warren, and Washington Counties in Pennsylvania which:  (1) Inject through a tubing string the size of which severely restrictsthe placement of temporary plugs for pressure testing or logging;  (2) Are constructed without long string casing due to the competent natureof the rock in the uncased interval;  (3) Are constructed with surface casing set through the lowermost undergroundsource of drinking water;  (4) Can demonstrate the absence of any obstruction in the surface casingwhich could interfere with the test; and  (5) Are constructed with tubing and packer cemented into the hole immediatelyabove the injection zone.  <T3>B. Procedures for Conducting the Water-in-Annulus Mechanical IntegrityTest  </T3>The water-in-annulus test, must be run acording to the following procedures: (1) Determine with a verifiable procedure, such as using a sinker bar,that there are no obstructions in the annulus to at least the depth ofthe surface casing seat;  (2) Shut the well in;  (3) Fill the annulus between the injection tubing and surface casing tothe top of the casing with water;  (4) Relieve pressure on the injection tubing until reservoir pressure isobtained;  (5) Measure the injection tubing pressure and the existing water levelin the annulus and record the values;  (6) Measure and record the water level every 10 minutes for a period ofone-half hour;  (7) Begin injection into the well and wait for the pressure to stabilizebefore beginning the second half of the test, and record the stabilizedpressure;  (8) Repeat steps (3) and (6);  (9) Compare the rate of water level change between shut-in and operatingconditions.  <T3>C. Interpretation  </T3>After taking into consideration the test results during the period of interimapproval, the Agency has determined that more definitive criteria be usedfor assessing the pass/fail standard for this final approval. In conjunctionwith these changes, the inconclusive category indicated in the July 14,1987, notice (52 FR26344) has been deleted.  Therefore, the following pass/fail criteria have been established:  (1) A well has failed to demonstate mechanical integrity pursuant to 40CFR 146.8(b) if:  (a) The water level rises with the well cooperating, but does not changewith the well shut-in;  (b) The water level declines by greater than 10 feet/one-half hour duringeither the shut-in or operating portion of the test or if the rate of changebetween the shut-in and operating portions of the test exceeds 2 feet/one-halfhour;  (c) The annulus of the well cannot be filled to the surface to performthe test; or  (d) An obstruction is encountered in a well's annulus and that obstructionprevents obtaining conclusive test results.  (2) Wells which fail the static portion of the water-in-annulus mechanicalintegrity test, due to the water level falling greater than 10 feet, mayuse one of the following options to demonstate the integrity of the surfacecasing.  <ITAG tagnum="15">Option 1. </ITAG>Insert a liner pipe on a packer, between the surfacecasing and the injection tubing, below the surface casing seat and testthe annulus between the liner and the surface casing. The well passes mechanicalintegrity if the water level does not decline by more than 10 feet. Ifthe suface casing is defective, then the liner must remain in the well. <ITAG tagnum="15">Option 2. Cement the surface casing/injection tubing annulus to thesurface. Mechanical integrity will then be determined by conducting a pressuretest on the well's tubing.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Option 3.
