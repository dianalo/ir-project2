But their born-again interventionism bears littleresemblance to the confidence and optimism that once led JohnKennedy to proclaim America would &quot;bear any burden&quot; and ledGeorge Bush to employ America's military might in the PersianGulf. Rather, this new liberal interventionism has deviatedfrom the simple strain of pursuing American interests into avariety of bizarre permutations.</LP><TEXT>   Many of them were on display at a conference here lastweek peopled largely by the prospective foreign policyadvisers to Democratic presidential candidates -- if thereever are any. Just as the Democrats are in search of acandidate, their foreign policy establishment is in search ofa foreign policy.   The spectrum of policies on parade ranged from a mutantform of interventionism so extreme that it proposesintervening militarily anywhere human rights are beingviolated (to wit Yugoslavia and Liberia) to an isolationismso pessimistic that it doesn't argue &quot;Come Home America&quot; but,in the words of one proponent, &quot;cry for America alone.&quot; Inbetween sit most of the policy pundits. They increasinglyargue for an interventionist foreign policy that relies on anactivist United Nations to uphold an expansive interpretationof international law.   But while international law may or may not be oxymoronic,an activist United Nations surely is. Indeed, this week'sSoviet coup dramatically underscores how unreliable is thehope that the U.N., led by a new Soviet-American partnership,can solve the world's problems.   There is a basic difference between these new high-mindedinterventionists and the more mundane variety who staff theBush administration. The latter understood in the Gulf Warthat an international alliance and U.N. imprimatur wereuseful fig leaves for American leadership and action. Bycontrast, the Aspen interventionists see U.S. nationalinterests as a convenient fig leaf for strengthening the U.N.to pursue a world federalist foreign policy.   During the '80s, many of these analysts argued, the U.S.couldn't lead unilaterally because the presence of the Sovietsuperpower made that too risky. These days, with the Sovietsrapidly approaching Third World status, they are reduced toarguing that the U.S. shouldn't. Its very power and primacy,they argue, impose moral constraints on unilateral actionwhile domestic priorities impose financial constraints.   What's not readily explicable is why the U.N., many ofwhose members represent virulent and violent authoritarianregimes, would provide a higher morality for interventionismthan American national interests. Nor is it clear why anAmerica that could afford to wage and win the Cold War cannotafford to protect its own interests in the post-Cold Warworld. The faith in the U.N. rests on the rhetoric of theU.N. charter, rather than on the reality of its membership.Similarly, the increasing faith in international law rests onits ideals, not on its history -- or prospect -- ofapplication.   Yet in the starry eyes of those who put their faith in theU.N., the world would look at a trouble spot like Liberia orYugoslavia, proclaim the civil wars there unacceptable, tryeconomic sanctions (on whom is unclear), vote to intervene,deploy a standing U.N. military force (composed of whom isagain unclear), and mop up the little mess. Saudi Arabia'sambassador to the U.S., listening to this scenario, indicatedafterward that had his nation's choice been between relianceon the U.N. or accommodation to Saddam's presence in Kuwait,it would of necessity have chosen Saddam. What saved SaudiArabia, in his view, was nothing less than U.S. militaryforce deployed in America's national interest, albeit cloakedby the U.N.   The myriad difficulties of multinational interventionismare nowhere clearer than in Yugoslavia. Not only is the U.N.unable to impose international law on the fractured peoplesthere, but the European Community -- a much smaller groupwith a much larger vested interest -- can't even begin toagree on a common policy as Germany tugs in one direction andFrance in another. In the U.S., meanwhile, not even the mostardent U.S. national security interventionists argue forsending American military forces to Croatia.   Precisely because the goals of the multinationalinterventionists are so grandiose, the prospects of theirever having to be acted upon are so slim. All this makesmultinational interventionism a strange bed in which genuineidealists and closet isolationists can lie side by side.Basically, in a world in which everything must be viewed as&quot;critical,&quot; nothing has to be taken very seriously. If theU.S. is expected to care equally about Iraq, Liberia,Yugoslavia and Sri Lanka, it soon will wind up caring littleabout any of them. A foreign policy without priorities set bygenuine national interests winds up being no foreign policyat all.   High on the priority list of the globalists of goodfeeling, of course, is the environment. In their view, the&quot;global environmental crisis&quot; provides yet another cause ofU.S. vulnerability and of Third World strength. In thisbizarre reversal of reality, the fact that many developingcountries are poisoning their environments leaves the U.S.with no choice but to cave in to their demands for money andinternational influence. While pollution is to some extent aglobal problem, these Third World countries will poisonthemselves long before they poison the West. In truth, it isnot the U.S. that will be hostage to Third World pollutersbut rather the Third World that will be victim of itself.   Indeed, if this Aspen conclave is any guide, if theDemocrats ever come up with a candidate, &quot;global warming&quot; islikely to sum up his or her foreign policy. What a warm andfuzzy feeling.   ---   Ms. House is vice president, international, of Dow Jones andamp;Co.</TEXT></DOC>
