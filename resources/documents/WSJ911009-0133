The decision, involving a $12.5 million award against aunit of Alexander andamp; Alexander Services Inc., was the first inthe nation to order a new trial to reconsider a punitivedamage award on grounds that it was unconstitutionally high.</LP><TEXT>   The New York insurance broker's unit had been accused by aBaltimore broker of breach of contract, conspiracy andinterference with its contract as the insurancerepresentative for a local hospital.   Punitive damages are awarded in civil cases as punishmentor to deter a defendant's conduct. High punitive damagesshould be declared unconstitutional, some advocates of legalreform argue, because juries often are not given sufficientguidance, resulting in awards that are out of proportion tothe harm done.   But the U.S. Supreme Court declined last term to defineuniform standards for making punitive damage awards, in acase known as Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. vs. Haslip.The high court ruled that state and federal courts shouldconsider &quot;general concerns of reasonableness&quot; and whetherjuries were given adequate instructions in determiningpunitive damage awards.   So far the impact of the court's decision has varied: Fourappeal courts reviewed contested awards and sustained them.Two other courts reduced the amounts. And in two other cases,appeals judges sent the issue back to the trial judge withinstructions to reconsider whether the amount might beunconstitutional.   Alexander andamp; Alexander hailed the Maryland decision as avictory. &quot;The facts are, we dispute that punitive damages areat all applicable in this instance, and we plan to prove thatin a new trial,&quot; said Michael K. White, a deputy chairman ofthe company.   The ruling -- by the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland,the state's second-highest court -- stems from a suit filedby B. Dixon Evander andamp; Associates, the Baltimore insurancebroker. A Baltimore City Circuit Court jury in May 1990awarded Evander $250,052 in compensatory damages and $40million in punitive damages. The punitive damages werereduced by the trial judge to $12.5 million. Alexander andamp;Alexander appealed both the verdict and the constitutionalityof the reduced punitive damage award, arguing that itviolated the company's right to due process.   The appeals court called the award &quot;unconstitutional.&quot; Itruled that while some punitive damages were justified, the$12.5 million was &quot;out of all proportion to both the harmcaused and the perniciousness of the conduct.&quot;   &quot;We accept the conclusion . . . that {Alexander andamp;Alexander} set out to cause economic harm to a competitor,that it used inappropriate means to achieve that goal andthat it should be punished for, and others deterred from,engaging in that conduct,&quot; Judge Alan Wilner wrote for thethree-member panel.   Maryland's previous highest punitive damage award involvedthe electrocution of a child by a downed high-voltageelectrical wire. The child's family was awarded $7.5 million.The appeals panel noted that &quot;nothing like that kind of harmoccurred in this case.&quot; Instead, the appeals judgescharacterized Alexander andamp; Alexander's conduct as &quot;excessive,ill-motivated and, in retrospect, stupid.&quot;   Evander's lead attorney in Baltimore could not be reachedfor comment, but Patrick O'Doherty, his co-counsel, said theoriginal punitive damage award of $40 million was justified.   &quot;There was nothing stupid about what they did,&quot; said Mr.O'Doherty. &quot;It was done knowingly and with full intent.&quot;   ---   PAUL, WEISS SAYS former pollster owes $250,000 in legalfees.   The New York law firm made the allegation in a suit filedFriday against Patrick Caddell, who has worked for formerPresident Carter, as well as former Sens. George McGovern andGary Hart and Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.) in theirpresidential bids.   The suit is unusual because law firms rarely sue tocollect fees outstanding.   Mr. Caddell said the dispute is the result of amiscommunication with Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp;Garrison, which until a month ago represented him in pendinglitigation against two former associates. Mr. Caddell said heowes Paul Weiss money but that he wants time to audit the lawfirm's bills.   Lewis R. Clayton, the Paul Weiss partner who filed thesuit in federal court in Manhattan against Mr. Caddell, saidthat the law firm yesterday agreed not to serve Mr. Caddellwith papers for 30 days while the parties attempt to settlethe dispute.   Mr. Caddell retained Paul Weiss to sue Doak andamp; Shrum Inc.,a political consulting firm, over fees earned on the 1986campaigns of Sen. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.) andPennsylvania's Gov. Robert Casey, and others. The case isexpected to go to trial this winter in Washington. Lastmonth, however, Mr. Caddell replaced the law firm with SandraW. Cuneo, a Washington attorney.   Mr. Caddell, who is no longer a political consultant, saidhe disagreed with Paul Weiss over strategy in the case butwould not comment further.   Both Mr. Caddell and Paul Weiss have strong connections tothe Democratic Party. The law firm's partners includeTheodore Sorenson, who served as an aide to PresidentKennedy, and Arthur Liman, who was counsel to the Senatepanel investigating the Iran-Contra affair.   ---   MORTON INTERNATIONAL unit not covered by insurance forcleanup.   A New Jersey state appeals court decided the disputebetween a subsidiary of Morton International Inc., based inChicago, and General Accident Insurance Co. of America overcoverage for mercury contamination at a creek in theHackensack Meadowlands, a wetlands area west of the HudsonRiver.   The appeals court upheld a trial court's decision thatfound Ventron Corp., which merged with Morton Thiokol Inc.and then became part of Morton International, knew it waspolluting the creek, continued to do so and therefore did notdeserve coverage under its comprehensive liability policy.   The decision is considered significant by insuranceattorneys, because New Jersey is traditionally the mostliberal state in granting coverage to policyholders in casesin which insurers and insured clash over pollution costs.Courts in other states generally haven't granted coverage forintentional pollution.   A spokeswoman for Morton International said the company isstill evaluating the decision.   ---   SAN FRANCISCO LAW FIRM ELECTS 20 new partners.   The move by Morrison andamp; Foerster is notable because manylaw firms are making many fewer partners this year as aresult of the economic downturn. Last year Morrison andamp;Foerster made 17 partners, and the year before it made 22 newpartners out of its associate ranks, according to Carl A.Leonard, the law firm's chairman.   &quot;We really have been true to what we've told people . . .that we will make partners out of the associate classes onthe basis of merit, and we do not apply economic tests,&quot; saidMr. Leonard. He said the approximately 600-lawyer firm isbilling about 5% fewer hours than last year, but that heexpected profits per partner for 1991 to be flat or slightlybetter than last year.   Morrison andamp; Foerster's new partners work in seven of its 13offices. Two of them are women who work part-time.   ---   LEADING BALLET DANCERS sue union over allegedly unfairpension benefits.   The suit, filed in federal court by nine of the nation'stop ballet dancers, claims that the American Guild of MusicalArtists hasn't represented ballet dancers fairly innegotiating benefits. The suit claims that the pension plan'sretirement age of 65 years discriminates against balletdancers, most of whom must retire before they turn 40.   The plaintiffs who brought the suit, filed in Manhattan,include Cynthia Gregory, a prima ballerina and former star ofthe American Ballet Theatre; Fernando Bujones, also aprincipal dancer of ABT; and Donald Williams, a principaldancer with the Dance Theatre of Harlem.   The suit seeks to be made a class action on behalf of allballet dancers in the union, which also represents operasingers and choristers. The suit claims the union has refusedto bargain for a plan that would pay ballet dancers a pensionat an earlier age.   A union spokesman said he hadn't seen the suit.</TEXT></DOC>
