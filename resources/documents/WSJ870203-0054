As previously reported, Green Tree, a Minneapolis housing and finance company, sued Drexel in 1985, alleging that Drexel put Green Tree &quot;in play&quot; by placing a substantial block of Green Tree stock with Drexel clients who have financed hostile bids. They included Saul Steinberg, head of Reliance Financial Services Corp., which amassed a 15% stake in Green Tree and later sold it back to the company for a $26 million gain.    Richard G. Evans, Green Tree vice president and general counsel, said yesterday in an interview that SEC investigators have contacted the company seeking information about the lawsuit. He said that Green Tree has given the SEC the names of Drexel employees, including Michael Milken, head of Drexel's high-yield &quot;junk-bond&quot; operation, who have testified in the case. Transcripts of the testimonies have been sealed by a federal court in Minneapolis.    As previously reported, Drexel is the subject of both SEC and grand jury investigations stemming from the Ivan F. Boesky insider-trading scandal. Drexel and some of its officials, including Mr. Milken, have been subpoenaed in that probe. The investment banking firm has said it hasn't committed any wrongdoing.    The SEC's interest indicates a further broadening of its investigation. As far as is known, Mr. Evans said, Mr. Boesky wasn't involved in the Green Tree situation. The SEC has declined to comment on its investigation.    A Drexel spokesman said, &quot;Our view has consistently been there was a major misunderstanding between Green Tree and Drexel. We certainly don't believe there was ever any interest on Reliance's part to take them over.&quot;    A Reliance spokesman said, &quot;Reliance purchases of Green Tree stock were for investment, and it was so stated in our regulatory filings.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
