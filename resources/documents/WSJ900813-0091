It will test whether Europeanshave the collective will to defend Europe's own interests or,once again, will simply &quot;let the Yanks do it.&quot;   That in turn will have a bearing on whether NATO has anyfuture as a military alliance, and whether Europe's vauntedambitions for &quot;political unity&quot; have a ghost of a chance.Many of Europe's politicians, it should be noted, were aseager as many U.S. congresspersons for unilateral disarmamentand the &quot;peace dividend&quot; before Saddam grabbed Kuwait. NoEuropean policy coordination was evident.</LP><TEXT>   After the invasion, European responses were mostlytentative. Everyone condemned Iraq, but so has the rest ofthe world. The only immediate substantive action came fromMargaret Thatcher, the least &quot;European&quot; of all of Europe'sleaders. She began dispatching planes, ships and troops tothe Gulf to bolster American, Turkish and Egyptian forces.She was the only European to provide instant militaryfirepower as a counter to any temptation Saddam might have totake advantage of his immediate numerical superiority.   France and Germany -- where most of the talk of &quot;politicalunity&quot; originates -- displayed very little of that unity.France said it would dispatch one of its two Clemenceau-classsmall carriers to the area. But since French forces are notunder NATO command, it is not clear how its ships and planeswill be teamed up with other naval and air forces.   That mostly endangers French sailors, since protectingships from missiles requires close coordination of defensiveunits. France has been Iraq's second most important armssupplier, after the Soviet Union. It would be supreme ironyif one of its own ships were hit with one of the Exocetmissiles it has sold Saddam.   The German government has had even more trouble making upits mind. Statements from the offices of the chancellor andthe foreign minister have conflicted, but both have stressedlegal restrictions on &quot;out-of-area&quot; use of German forces. Noteven a hint of support came from Karsten Voight, spokesmanfor the opposition Social Democrats, who said that Germantroops have &quot;no business&quot; in the Gulf. Germans, too, haveprovided lethal technology to the Arabs. Industrialist JurgenHippenstiel-Imhausen was convicted in June of selling Libyaequipment that could be used to make poison gas.   Italy, although it has a strong navy, couldn't even decidewhether to support the United Nations embargo on Iraqi oil.The foreign ministry was quoted last Thursday as saying theembargo is not &quot;total&quot; so far as Italy is concerned.   Italy, Spain and Germany did quickly agree to let the U.S.dispatch planes and forces from their NATO air bases. That'sat least progress from responses to past Middle East crises.U.S. F-111s from England had to give the European continent awide berth, entailing a long flight and midair refueling,when President Reagan dispatched them to punish MoammarGadhafi. The fact that most of Gadhafi's terrorism had beenconducted in Europe was deemed immaterial.   Europe's NATO members traditionally have found itconvenient to turn a deaf ear to U.S. pleas that they helpdeal with out-of-area security problems. When the Soviets andCuba were building up their Caribbean presence through theconstruction of air bases on the island of Grenada and thenortheast coast of Nicaragua, U.S. admirals warned that therewere strategic implications for Europe as well as the U.S. Alot of Europe's commerce flows through the Panama Canal andthe Caribbean. The allies weren't interested, so the U.S.tackled that problem independently, encountering oppositionfrom German leftist supporters of Castro's Sandinistaproteges in Nicaragua.   Going back to the late 1960s, some Americans stillremember needling from Britons -- &quot;pity about Vietnam&quot; -- ata time when American troops were trying to halt the spread ofcommunism in Southeast Asia. British interests were just asmuch jeopardized as American interests. It has been left upto the Americans to combat Arab terrorism, even though muchof it was directed at Europe, because France, Italy and, tosome degree, Germany and England, didn't want to jeopardizetheir commercial and political ties with Arab nations. AsAlbert Wohlstetter and Fred Hoffman wrote in the Journal lastweek, there also was ambivalence over whether Turkey, a NATOmember, would merit NATO support if it were attacked by Iraqor Syria.   Saddam Hussein's grab does not necessarily chuck all thoseconflicting interests out the window. Judging from KarstenVoight's statement, it won't instantly cause the Europeanleft to embrace American leadership. But judging from theoverwhelming (83%) public support in the U.K. for Mrs.Thatcher's dispatch of forces to the Gulf, it is likely thatEurope's priorities will undergo some change. Those bigtankers sailing into Rotterdam from the Persian Gulf everyday are a vital lifeline for Europe. Saddam Hussein surelyhas exploded the myth that the only threat to Europe was froma now-dismembered Warsaw Pact.   Whether NATO is unified sufficiently to step up toout-of-area threats has not been resolved, however. Thepreference among most European leaders is for conduct of thePersian Gulf military operation under the aegis of the UnitedNations, or maybe the Western European Union. That wouldpreserve NATO's purity, but it would also guarantee itsultimate extinction, since its single mission, to protectEurope from a Soviet attack, suffers from diminishingcredibility.   Such a demise would be a shame. One of the largely hiddenvirtues of NATO has been that it has combined under a centralcommand the military forces of nations whose quarrels havecost the world many millions of lives in this century. Germanreunification should, if anything, emphasize the importanceof that. It also should give France second thoughts aboutthat now-outdated DeGaulle decision to keep France's forcesoutside the unified command, although there is no sign ofsuch second thoughts. Finally, a credible NATO, capable ofagreeing quickly on a military response to out-of-areacrises, would deter future Saddams from jeopardizing Europeanand North American interests.   But if Europe's leaders -- other than Mrs. Thatcher -- areaware of all this, it hasn't been immediately obvious. With apotentially effective military alliance already in place,there will be continued speculation on alternative &quot;security&quot;structures, such as the Committee for Security andCooperation in Europe (CSCE), of dubious value. As Mr. Bakersaid, Europe faces some big decisions. And events are movingfast.</TEXT></DOC>
