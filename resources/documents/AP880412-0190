If convicted in the youth court, Mohammed Hamadi would face amaximum 10-year term. He had been scheduled to go on trial nextmonth as an adult and could have drawn a maximum life sentence.   In West Germany defendants under 21 are tried in youth court.Hamadi's 21st birthday came two days before the hijacking on June15, 1985, according to the Frankfurt state court.   ``However, a possibility exists that the perpetration of thecrime that he is accused of may have begun before June 13, 1985,and goes back to the time of his adolescence,'' a court statementsaid.   ``Therefore, the case has been turned over to the youth court,''it said.   Hamadi was charged in February with murder, hostage-taking andother crimes stemming from the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner toBeirut during which U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed and39 U.S. citizens were held hostage for 17 days.   Moving the case to a youth court means the news media could bebarred from Hamadi's trial and proceedings may not begin formonths, authorities said.   Judicial sources in Frankfurt said they believed Hamadi's trialwas not likely to start before the end of the year.   ``The Hesse state youth court will now need time to study thecase files before it can decide on when Mohammed Hamadi's trialwill start,'' the court statement said.   A federal Justice Ministry spokesman who spoke on condition ofanonymity said the youth court could decide to exclude the pressfrom Hamadi's trial. He said the decision would not be made untilthe trial begins.   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13, 1987,carrying liquid explosives and false documents.   Last year, the United States asked for Hamadi's extradition onair piracy and murder charges.   The West German government refused the request after thekidnapping in Beirut of West Germans Rudolf Cordes and AlfredSchmidt in January 1987. It said he would be tried in West Germanyinstead.   Defense attorneys in Duesseldorf gave their closing argumentsTuesday in the case of Hamadi's brother, Abbas.   Abbas Hamadi is charged with kidnapping the two West Germans inan attempt to force West German authorities to release his brother.   Schmidt was released by his captors in September in what theysaid was a ``goodwill gesture,'' but Cordes is still being held.</TEXT></DOC>
