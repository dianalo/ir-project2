One of the MiG-29 supersonic jets was shown on Iraniantelevision Sunday. One source in Tehran said the planes were partof a $6 billion package Rafsanjani signed with the Soviets that issaid to include tanks and other heavy weaponry.   The deal emphasizes the degree to which the Soviet Union hasshifted away from Iraq, its longtime ally in the gulf region.   The acquisition of the supersonic fighters is a big boost forIran's badly depleted air force. Iraq, Iran's foe in the 1980-88war, has 30 of the advanced MiG-29s.   ``The Kremlin has never sold the MiGs to any government exceptthose whose ties with Moscow were more than excellent,'' The TehranTimes, which is close to Rafsanjani, noted in an editorial. ``Assuch, the Soviets' agreement to sell Iran the advanced fighters hasa great deal of significance for regional political circles.''   ``Iran's military purchases will not be limited to this newlyacquired batch of fighters. Moscow has announced its agreement tosell more arms to the Islamic republic,'' the newspaper said.   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said in atelephone interview that Tehran bought the fighters on conditionthey were delivered ``fully equipped,'' with sophisticatedelectronics not made available to other Soviet clients such asIraq.   The fighters were fitted with lookdown-shootdown radar, whichprovides all-weather operating capability against low-flyingtargets, the source said.   The Mig-29s, which the Soviets have been using since 1985 andwhich are comparable to the U.S.-made F-16, also came equipped withinfra-red search-and-track sensors, the source said.   Iran's state-tun television network, monitored in Nicosia,Saturday showed a MiG-29 fighter with Iranian air force markingswheeled out of a hangar for take-off.   The source said Iranian pilots were sent to the Soviet Union forMiG-29 training soon after Rafsanjani signed the deal in Moscow.   Iran has been rebuilding its armed forces since the August 1988cease-fire in the gulf war. Mansour Sattari, Iran's air forcecommander, said in June that Iran would equip its air force with``the world's most sophisticated military weapons.''   The Iranian air force, a powerful force supplied withsophisticated U.S.-made jets under the late shah, quickly fellapart during the gulf war for lack of spare parts. It now consistsof fewer than 50 planes, some without radar.   The Tehran Times said other European countries have ``informedTehran of their preparedness to meet Iran's military needs and itis said that Iran is considering these offers as well.''   China has offered weapons at ``good prices. ... But Tehran seemsto opt for sophisticated and advanced weaponry, for its air forcein particular,'' it said.   Western military sources say Iran spends $6 billion a year ondefense.</TEXT></DOC>
