Al Gore is looking into borrowing moneyfor extensive TV ads in the Super Tuesday states critical to hispresidential campaign, but a spokesman said Sunday he has taken noloans yet.   ``We've been exploring options about borrowing money because wewant to have a comprehensive media buy,'' said press spokesman MikeKopp.   The Tennessee senator is running a son-of-the-South campaign andhas vowed to spend more than any rival campaign on the SuperTuesday primaries.   But campaign finance reports through January show Gore was wellbehind rival Michael Dukakis in spending.   Gore began running his commercials three weeks ago on cable TVnationwide and on local TV in the 14 southern Super Tuesday states,and a new series of ads begins Tuesday, Kopp said.   ``To date no loans have been taken,'' he said, but added that,``Our finance people have talked to banks,'' to line up thepossibilities.   Aftern ending January, with $2 million in the bank, Gore hasboosted that to more than $3 million through fund-raisers and mail,Kopp said.   Campaign finance reports show that Dukakis as of Jan. 31 hadspent more in 13 of the 20 Super Tuesday states than any Democratin the race, and close to $1 million in all the Super Tuesdaystates. The Massachusetts governor had $4 million in the bank atthe end of January and his campaign says he is now raising $20,000a day.   Gore was a distant second, spending only $287,542 by the end ofJanuary.   That was less even than the $345,280 spent by his cash-poorDemocratic rival Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois who has now decided tosit out Super Tuesday.   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri reported spending $482,697 onSuper Tuesday states through January.   The figures are from the latest financial disclosure statementsthe candidates filed with the Federal Election Commission, coveringthe period through Jan. 31.   On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush had husbandedhis ample resources while rivals Sen. Bob Dole and Pat Robertsonboth swept past him in laying groundwork for Super Tuesday.   Most of the campaigns, with Gore the notable exception, turnedtheir attention to Feb. 8 Iowa contest and Feb. 16 primary in NewHampshire, then directed their resources to the Super Tuesdaystates in the latter part of this month. Figures for February havenot yet been released.   Robertson, the former TV evangelist, spent more than anyone inearly Super Tuesday efforts. His total of $3.2 million included$1.1 million in Texas, which was the biggest allocation reported byany of the campaigns for a single state.   Bush, on the other hand, spent $335,743 in his adoptive homestate of Texas, and $1.7 overall in the Super Tuesday states; andDole reported $81,645 in Texas expenditures and $2 million overall.   Aside from Texas, Bush was putting most of his money, $416,449,into Florida as of Jan. 31. Dole had spent $150,744 in Florida andRobertson $617,933.   Super Tuesday spending could spell strategy problems forRobertson because as of the end of January he had already spent$17.6 million against the $23 million overall ceiling imposed oncandidates who receive federal matching funds.   The other Republican candidate, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York,whose campaign has rowed through turbulent financial waters,reported spending of $11,312 in Texas, $8,529 in Florida, and$819,311 overall. However, $723,027 of his money was allocated toMassachusetts, where several campaigns bought heavily on Boston TVstations because that market includes viewers in neighboring NewHampshire.   Kemp adviser Charlie Black said last week that the campaign doesnot anticipate any new loans, after borrowing heavily against hisfederal matching funds last year and in January. Kemp planned torun TV ads in seven Super Tuesday states.   The Democrats have raised and spent less money overall than theRepublicans.   Dukakis, the Democratic leader, had put most of his resourcesinto Texas, $301,829; Florida, $206,861; and North Carolina,$146,582.   Gephardt had spent $482,697 on the March 8 contests, but most ofthat, $316,822, was devoted to his home state of Missouri, whichhis opponents are virtually ignoring.   His spokeswoman, Ali Webb, said Sunday that the campaign goalwas to spend $2 million on super Tuesday. Gephardt has targeted sixSuper Tuesday states for TV _ Texas, Florida, Oklahoma, Arkansas,North Carolina, Alabama and Georgia _ and will buy in selectedmarkets in other states, she said.   The Gephardt campaign, which ended January in debt, is``spending money as fast as it comes in,'' Webb said.   As of Jan. 31, his biggest Super Tuesday state outside Missouriwas Texas, where he spent $69,809.   Gore's biggest spending was also in Texas, $74,921.   Simon, who last week announced he would skip Super Tuesday butstay in the race for later contests, had devoted most of his$345,280 in Super Tuesday spending to North Carolina, where hespent $153,582.   Jesse Jackson had spent less than $10,000 in just three SuperTuesday states, North Carolina, Maryland and Kentucky. Jackson isexpected to run strongly across the South, where 14 states areamong the Super Tuesday battles.   He has raised considerably less money than his competitors, buthis campaign concentrates on the free media that he engenders byvirture of his international personality status and his ability todraw large crowds virtually everywhere he goes.   Gary Hart, the former senator from Colorado, had spent $37,814in Texas as of Jan. 31, and just $12,000 in five other SuperTuesday states.</TEXT></DOC>
