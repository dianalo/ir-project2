But for those who labor during odd hours, the task is sometimes impossible. Now, creative child care is starting to fill the gap.    Consider:   --The Washington, D.C., law firm of Wilmer, Cutler andamp; Pickering has added a day-care facility to its downtown office building that parents can use for emergencies during the week and for working on weekends. &quot;I've got a pressure valve with this,&quot; says Jane Sherburne, an associate with three children who conceived the idea for the center.    --America West Airlines Inc. opened a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week center near the Phoenix, Ariz., airport after employees complained that it was &quot;very difficult to find child care because of fluctuating schedules,&quot; says Daphne Dicino, the airline's director of communications.    --The Opryland USA complex in Nashville, Tenn., provides an on-site child-care center that is open from 5:30 a.m. to midnight. Management even uses the center as a promotional tool when recruiting new employees.    Parents who work nights, weekends, rotating shifts and extra hours have always faced special obstacles in finding child care, especially if they are single or have spouses who also work unusual hours. In the past, a grandmother, sister or other relative often helped out, but demographic and generational changes have pared those options. As a result, more employers &quot;are looking at some way of helping employees with those kinds of needs,&quot; says Jan Pagliasotti, a senior associate with Work/Family Directions Inc., a consulting company in Watertown, Mass.    The problems are particularly acute among parents who work at airlines, hospitals, restaurants, hotels, mail and other delivery services, police and fire departments, and factories that run evening and graveyard shifts. Most day-care centers are geared to the typical workday, closing about 6 p.m. and sometimes charging stiff fees if parents pick up children late.    Debbie Robertson, a single mother who works weekends and late hours in the communications center at San Francisco International Airport, says she has had &quot;a rough time&quot; finding baby sitters. &quot;The last one got tired of working weekends,&quot; she says, and her relatives are &quot;basically not the baby-sitter types.&quot; She plans to use a new child-care center near the airport that will be open 24 hours a day -- a combined project of United Way, county child-care groups and airport labor unions.    Hospitals are pioneers in providing day care for employees' children. And about 20% of hospitals that provide child care now offer night or round-the-clock hours, says Jane Grady, past president of the National Association of Hospital-Affiliated Child Care Programs. The benefit has become an important recruiting tool during the current national nursing shortage. Connie Harrison, a nurse-education coordinator who works with heart surgery patients at Baton Rouge General Medical Center in Louisiana, says she relies on long hours offered by the hospital's day-care center for her &quot;real unpredictable&quot; shifts.    Her daughter, Amy, 4, has used the facility for two years, and the baby that Mrs. Harrison is expecting will go there &quot;from the very beginning,&quot; she says. The center opens as early as 5:45 a.m. and stays open as late as 12:30 a.m. &quot;If there's an emergency, we'll stay open 24 hours,&quot; says Lou Koberg, who runs the center. Nurses working the evening shift can leave their children in the center, Mrs. Harrison explains, where attendants &quot;bathe them and put gowns on them and get them fixed up for the night, put them to sleep and then you just carry them to the car.&quot;    Even workplaces dominated by men are developing creative solutions to child care. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, where only 2,000 of 11,000 employees are women, sponsors a nearby day-care center that is open from 6:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. and runs a referral service of family homes with expanded hours for its shift workers.    &quot;Not only is child care a women's issue, here it's a men's issue,&quot; particularly because of the growing number of divorced men with joint custody of children, says Beverly King, director of the utility's human resources division. The utility finds the center useful not only in recruiting engineers in a competitive market, but in enhancing productivity. An employee survey on days lost due to child-care problems or caring for ill children showed about $1 million in lost productivity in 1985.    Indeed, many companies experimenting with such programs find they help attract and retain employees and enhance morale. Management at Opryland USA has heavily advertised its child-care center as part of an effort to staff a new hotel addition. The company subsidizes the center at the rate of about $4,000 a month to lower fees, says Elwyn Taylor, the human resources director, and is planning to expand it because of its popularity.    Such programs aren't without their problems. As with traditional child-care centers, some parents are constantly late in picking up their children -- even with the extended hours. Others take advantage of some centers' flexible schedules. At Wilmer Cutler in Washington, where the child-care center is normally open only until 5:30 p.m. during the week, the rule for leaving a child after hours is strict: &quot;It's got to be an emergency,&quot; says Anne-Marie Smith, the director.    One employee at the law firm was reprimanded for trying to use the center when a spouse just wanted to go shopping. But most uses have been necessary, some of them poignantly so. A secretary left her child in the center for several days while she searched for a new child-care worker because she was afraid her regular one was hitting her child.    The law firm's Ms. Sherburne came up with the plan for the center after two crises arose. Once, when her husband was out of town, the baby sitter was sick, and she had been up half the night preparing a critical filing due the next day before the Federal Communications Commission, Ms. Sherburne brought her four-year-old son to the office. During a tense meeting with two partners just hours before the deadline, her son began merrily singing &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.&quot; Another time, when a hurricane closed schools and kept baby sitters home, the firm's conference room was filled with 10 children, and lawyers were shuttling in and out all day playing parent.    Ms. Sherburne's proposal for an emergency center was submitted to the firm's management committee, which approved it. The results, she says, have been &quot;more billable hours,&quot; plus better recruiting and morale. And it provides a safety net in a competitive field where women lawyers with children sometimes are forced to sacrifice career for family. &quot;I don't feel handicapped,&quot; Ms. Sherburne says, &quot;by having three children.&quot;    ---                          Odd Hours   About 16% of U.S. workers are on shifts rather than regular daytime schedules. Of those, the following percentages work:    4 p.m. to midnight                                40%    Rotating shifts (days to evenings, etc.)          27%    Midnight to 8 a.m.                                17%    Other shifts (irregular hours)                    12%    Split shifts (two periods each day)                4%   Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics</TEXT></DOC>
