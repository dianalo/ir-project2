The directive was made in an effort to appease angry gaysin San Francisco and other cities over an internal videoshown by GM's Chevrolet unit last September, which containeda reference to a foreign competitor's product as &quot;that littlefaggot truck.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Upon learning of the video through news reports, the cityof San Francisco, home to a powerful gay lobby, threatened torescind its contract with GM for about $500,000 a year incars and trucks, unless the auto maker could show how itwould avoid discriminating against gays in the future. SanFrancisco, which received letters of support from around thecountry, acted under a city ordinance that bansdiscrimination against homosexuals.   In addition to notifying San Francisco officials last weekabout its new directive, the company, in its Decembernewsletter, condemned discrimination against gays. Also, GMChairman Robert C. Stempel has sent a letter of apology tothe city of San Francisco.   &quot;I want to assure you that this singular unfortunateincident does not reflect General Motors policies, practicesor attitudes toward lesbian and gay people,&quot; Mr. Stempelwrote in the Nov. 6 letter to San Francisco SupervisorRichard Hongisto, who led the protest against the slur.   In San Francisco, city officials said they were &quot;pleased&quot;with GM's actions and were inclined to lift the threat of aboycott -- as long as GM can demonstrate how thenon-discrimination policy will be implemented. The directive,issued Nov. 29 to GM managers nationwide, states only thateach &quot;employing unit&quot; will be charged with carrying out thepolicy.   &quot;We feel that General Motors at its highest leadership hasdemonstrated a sincere commitment to undo the damage that hasbeen done, and we feel their efforts are laudable andsincere,&quot; said T.J. Anthony, administrative aide to Mr.Hongisto.   The city would also like GM officials to considercontributing money to a national organization that fightsdiscrimination against gays.   GM officials weren't available for comment Friday. But inhis letter to the city, Mr. Stempel explained that GM didn'tintentionally include the &quot;faggot&quot; reference in the video,shown during an internal marketing show in Detroit.   GM officials have said that the slur was made by acustomer being interviewed for the video on why he preferredChevrolet products over smaller foreign models. In hisletter, Mr. Stempel said the interview was aired along with anumber of other customer interviews.   Although Detroit-based GM already has ananti-discrimination policy, the new directive adds protectionregardless of one's sexual orientation.   &quot;Abuse of the dignity of anyone through slurs or otherderogatory or objectionable conduct, including that based onsexual orientation, is offensive employee behavior and has noplace in General Motors,&quot; said the directive by R.F. O'Brien,vice-president of industrial relations staff, and G.A.Knechtel, vice-president of personnel, administration anddevelopment staff.</TEXT></DOC>
