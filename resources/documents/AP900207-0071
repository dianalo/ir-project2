We aremobilizing the resources to deal with it, but I am afraid it isworse than we thought.''   He said a WHO medical team is still trying to ``figure outexactly how this has happened and, particularly, what steps must betaken immediately to stop this now.''   ``It is a preventable tragedy,'' Mann said on ABC's ``GoodMorning America'' program. ``This need not have happened. We nowneed to make sure that nothing more happens of this kind.''   Mann said the major route of spread apparently was the use ofuntested AIDS-infected blood and the repeated use of needles andsyringes on children without sterilizing them between uses.   Earlier this week Dr. Jacques Lebas, president of theParis-based Doctors of the World, urged the international healthcommunity to provide Romania with disposable needles andblood-screening equipment.   Mann said his organization is ``undertaking an initiative'' withall the countries of Eastern Europe ``to determine the scope of theproblem, determine what needs to be done and do it, because AIDS isa reality now in Eastern Europe.''   Mann was asked whether he expected to find other situationssimilar to that in Romania.   ``Let's hope that we don't ever have to see something like thisagain, but I'm afraid that as we look further into the countries ofEastern Europe with the ministries of health, that we are going tofind evidence of more infection than was previously discussed,particularly in countries like Poland and Yugoslavia,'' said Mann.   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's immunesystem, leaving victims vulnerable to a wide variety of infectionsand cancers. A person can carry the human immunodeficiency virus,which causes AIDS, for years without developing the disease. Butalmost all cases lead to the disease.</TEXT></DOC>
