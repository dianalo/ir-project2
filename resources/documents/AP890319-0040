LaBELLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israeli soldiers killed four Palestinians andwounded at least 18 in the most intense clashes in months in theoccupied territories, Arab reports said. The army confirmed two deadand nine wounded in the clashes.   The renewed violence took the Palestinian death toll to at least403 since the Arab uprising against Israel's occupation of the WestBank and Gaza Strip began in December 1987.   Protests erupted in the occupied Gaza Strip after three Arabswere killed by Israeli gunfire and at least 20 others were woundedon Saturday.   Early Sunday, a 26-year-old Palestinian was shot to death afterstabbing three Israeli border police in Gaza City, the army said.   Israel Radio said the border guards were wounded as they brokeinto a house in pursuit of the masked Palestinian who fled afterhurling rocks at troops. Two of the soldiers were reported inmoderate condition and the third was lightly wounded.   The dead man was identified by hospital officials as Talal SelimAl-Araj, from the city's Daraj neighborhood. The officials said hewas shot in the head and chest.   In the afternoon, a 15-year-old Arab boy was fatally shot in thecity after hurling a bottle at soldiers. The army said the soldierwho opened fire thought the bottle was a firebomb. Soldiers haveorders allowing them to shoot if attacked with firebombs.   The name of the boy was not released.   Israel radio and Arab reports said two other Palestinians,including a 12-year-old, were shot to death as troops opened fire onstone-throwing youths in Silet Harthieh, a village near the WestBank town of Jenin.   An army spokesman said soldiers opened fire in the Jenin, butadded military investigators were still trying to confirm the deathsand checking reports of other casualties throughout the occupiedterritories.   The victims in Jenin were identified by Arab reporters as SamerMohammed Arouri, 12, and Neman Jaradat, 18, who both were reportedshot in the head.   Most of the injuries were reported in the Gaza Strip, wherePalestinians staged a general strike to protest three shootingdeaths the day before.   Palestinian teen-agers blocked entrances to Gaza City withtrucks, rocks and burning tires.   In an effort to quell the violence, the army confined more than165,000 people to their homes in five refugee camps and severalneighborhoods of Gaza City, an Arab reporter said.   Bursts of automatic weapons fire could be heard throughout GazaCity as soldiers tried to put down rioting, he said.   In one neighborhood of the city, about 100 youths marched throughthe streets waving the Koran, Islam's holy book, and shouting ``Godis great ... Down with the occupiers.''   Arab journalists compared the intensity of rioting in Gaza to theearly days of the uprising, and an army official said uprisingleaders were testing border police newly assigned to the occupiedterritories.   ``It's primarily a test of the Border Police who have areputation for keeping order,'' deputy army spokesman, Col. RaananGissin said. ``They are trying to keep the border Police fromgetting more control of the streets than the army reserve unitshad.''   The army has tried to reduce bloodshed in the occupiedterritories by replacing untrained reserve troops with Border Policeunits, who are experienced in riot control and are permanentlyassigned to the disputed areas.   Among those wounded in Sunday's clashes were 12 Palestinians shotin the Gaza Strip, including a 13-year-old boy in serious conditionwith a head wound, Arab reports said. In the West Bank, sixPalestinians were reportedly wounded when soldiers opened fire onstone-throwing protesters.</TEXT></DOC>
