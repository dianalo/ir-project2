Attention: Paperwork Reduction Project 0625-0105.<T3> Regulatory Flexibility Act.</T3> The General Counsel of the Departmentof Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the SmallBusiness Administration that this rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small business entities because, to theextent it changes existing practices, the rule simply improves the administrationof the antidumping duty provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended.As a result, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was not prepared.<T3> Background:</T3> The current antidumping duty regulations in SubpartsA, B, C, and D of 19 CFR Part 353 (45 FR 8182, February 6, 1980, as amendedby 48 FR 56744, December 23, 1983; 49 FR 22466, May 30, 1984; 50 FR 5746,February 12, 1985; 50 FR 32556, August 13, 1985; 51 FR 25195, July 11,1986; and 52 FR 30660, August 17, 1987) are based on Subtitles B, C, andD of Title I of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (``Trade Agreements Act''),which amended Title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. Subtitle IV,Parts II, III, and IV) (``Act''). Title VI of the Trade and Tariff Actof 1984 (Pub. L. No. 98-573, October 30, 1984) (``1984 Act'') amended thoseprovisions of the Act, effective on the dates specified in section 1886(b)of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. No. 99-514, October 22, 1986). Some of the changes to the current antidumping duty regulations are necessaryto implement the amendments made by the 1984 Act. Other changes: (1) incorporateexisting administrative interpretations and practices, not currently statedin the regulations, that will continue under the amended statute; (2) improveadministrative efficiency in antidumping duty proceedings; or (3) simplifythe language of existing regulations. The Department currently is draftinga proposed rule and request for comments to implement the amendments madeby the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (``1988 Act''). Thisfinal rule does not reflect changes required by the 1988 Act, except thatwe have referred to certain changes made by the 1988 Act in response tocomments on sections 353.2(k), 353.2(o), 353.2(t), 353.12(a), 353.12(b)(8),353.15, 353.16(b), 353.20(a), 353.34, 353.34(d), and  353.52. The finalrule printed here (Part 353) replaces the entire text of Part 353 thathas been in effect since February 6, 1980 (45 FR 8182).The Department has considered carefully all of the comments received inresponse to the proposed rule and request for comments on 19 CFR part 353that was published on August 13, 1986 (51 FR 29046). These comments, andthe Department's responses to them, are summarized below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Index</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> We have added as Annex I a consolidated listing of timelimits under these regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.2</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> One party suggests that the Department include a definitionof ``administrative review'' in this section. This party notes that theDepartment currently uses the term ``proceeding'' to refer to a singleadministrative review. This use, however, conflicts with the proposed definitionof proceeding in andSection; 353.2(q), which does not consider a proceedingended when an order is issued. A definition of ``administrative review''would prevent conflicting uses of the term ``proceeding,'' and would clarifythat proprietary information obtained in one administrative review maynot be used in a subsequent review.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The meaning of ``administrative review''is detailed in section 751 of the Act and andSection; 353.22 of these regulations.The use of proprietary information is controlled by the administrativeprotective order (``APO'') itself and by andSection; 353.34(b), paragraph(3)(ii) of which prohibits the use of such information by the party tothe proceeding except for ``the segment of the proceeding in which it wassubmitted.'' To the extent that in practice the Department has not consistentlyused the term ``proceeding'' to conform with the definition in these regulations,we are taking steps to remedy this situation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.2(f)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> We have moved to paragraph (f) of this section the definitionof weighted-average dumping margin, which was included in the regulationpromulgated on August 17, 1987 regarding <T3>de minimis</T3> dumping margins (included as andSection; 353.6 of thisfinal rule). We also have made certain technical changes to the definitionof dumping margin and of weighted-average dumping margin; these revisionsdo not change agency practice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We note that in cases involving processing arrangements (<T3>e.g.,</T3> tolling arrangements), the method of calculating the dumpingmargin and the weighted-average dumping margin may differ from that setforth in the regulation. <T3>See, e.g., Small Diameter Welded Carbon Steel Pipes and Tubes fromthe Philippines,</T3> 51 FR 33099 (1986); <T3>Brass Sheet and Strip from Canada,</T3> 51 FR 44319 (1986).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.2(j)</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> One party requests that the Department affirm its practiceof presuming that a petitioner has filed an action on behalf of an industryunless and until significant opposition from other domestic producers hasbeen presented. This party also is troubled by the reference to ``<T3>the</T3> like product'' (emphasis added) in the first sentence of theproposed regulation. The party argues that use of the word ``the,'' combinedwith the Department's stated intention to consult with the InternationalTrade Commission (``Commission'') on the decision concerning the like product,is overly restrictive, likely to be contentious, and goes beyond the legislativeintent of the standing requirement_``to prevent companies or individualswith <T3>no</T3> interest from commencing an investigation.'' This party suggestsmodifying the definition of ``industry'' to be the producers of ``<T3>a</T3>'' like product. Furthermore, this party believes that the Department'sproposal would permit circumvention of the decision in <T3>Roses Inc. v. United States,</T3> 706 F.2d 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1983), whichdoes not permit the Department to receive views from importers or foreignproducers prior to a determination to initiate.Another party argues that the regulation improperly deletes part of thestatutory definition of industry and authorizes the exclusion of importersfrom the industry. The legislative history of the 1984 Act indicates thatsection 771(4)(B) was intended to allow the Commission to exclude importersin injury determinations, not to allow the Department to exclude importerswhen determining standing to file a petition.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> As we stated in <T3>Certain Textile Mill Products and Apparel from Malaysia,</T3> 50 FR9852, 9853 (1985), the holding in <T3>Gilmore Steel Corp. v. United States,</T3> 7 CIT 219 (1984), ``doesnot amount to a requirement that a petitioner somehow prove, when a petitionis filed, that at least 51 percent of an industry has expressed itselfin support of a petition.'' The proposed regulation does not disturb existingpractice in this regard.The phrase ``the like product'' appears in the existing regulation andits use here will not result in a change in agency practice. The use of``the,'' as opposed to ``a,'' in referring to like product and the Department'sintention to consult with the Commission are not intended to be overlyrestrictive or to go beyond Congressional intent with respect to the standingrequirement. Pre-initiation consultations with the Commission at the stafflevel permit the Department to draw on that agency's expertise and itsknowledge of the injury requirements for initiation of a proceeding. Inaddition, the regulation does not circumvent the teaching in <T3>Roses</T3> on pre-initiation contact with potential interested partiesthat might be adversely affected by an investigation and order. <T3>Roses</T3> does not limit the Department's pre-initiation communicationswith the Commission.Although the legislative history does not explicitly address standing requirementsin discussing the definition of ``industry,'' the meaning of ``industry''is integral not only to the Commission's determinations of injury but alsoto the Department's decision on standing under section 732(b)(1) of theAct. The proposed regulatory definition highlights those parts of the definitionin section 771(4) of the Act that are relevant to standing.The part of the definition that refers to producers of a ``major proportion''of the total domestic production is not pertinent to standing because applyingit could result in a petition that has the support of just over one quarterof the domestic industry, as the following analysis shows. Section 732(b)(1)requires that a petition be filed ``on behalf of'' an industry. Both theCourt of International Trade, in <T3>Gilmore Steel Corp. </T3>v.<T3> United States, </T3>7 CIT 219 (1984), and the Department, in <T3>Certain Textile Mill Products and Apparel from Malaysia,</T3> 50 FR9852 (1985), interpret the ``on behalf of'' language to mean that standingcan be defeated if a majority of the concerned industry opposes the petition.If ``industry'' is defined as a simple majority (``a major proportion'')of total domestic production, and ``on behalf of'' is also a mere majority,then a petitioner filing ``on behalf of an industry'' would have standingas long as a majority of the majority of the industry did not oppose thepetition. If a petition may be filed ``on behalf of'' producers of a ``majorproportion'' of total domestic production, arguably opposition by evena substantial majority of U.S. producers would not suffice to show lackof standing. This result was not intended by the requirement to file onbehalf of an industry. Because this conclusion contradicts and confusesthe intent of the requirement to file on behalf of an industry, the ``majorproportion'' of the industry element of the definition is not pertinentfor standing purposes.As to our proposed inclusion of the related party provision of section771(4)(B) of the Act, the Court in <T3>Gilmore </T3>indicated that it believes the Department may excludeimporters from the industry for standing purposes if appropriate. 7 CITat 226-27 (<T3>dicta</T3>). The Department has used this provision on a number ofoccasions. <T3>See, e.g., Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice from Brazil, </T3>52 FR8324 (1987); <T3>Fabricated Auto Glass from Mexico, </T3>50 FR 1906 (1985). The Departmentfinds the proposed regulatory definition to be the appropriate one forpurposes of identifying those producers with a stake in the outcome. <T3>Gilmore Steel Corp. </T3>v.<T3> United States, </T3>7 CIT at 224. For these reasons, the comment isnot adopted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.2(k)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>To be consistent with changes made to the countervailingduty regulations, we have revised paragraphs (k)(3), (k)(4), and (k)(5)to refer to sellers of the like product produced in the United States.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We also note that we are drafting a regulation to implement section1326(c) of the 1988 Act, which expands the definition of interested partiesto include, in investigations involving processed agricultural products,a coalition or trade association representative of (a) processors, (b)processors and producers, or (c) processors and growers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.2(l)</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> One party suggests the regulation be clarified to indicatethat an investigation ends with a notice of suspension of investigation,except when the investigation has been continued under andSection; 353.18(i).Another party suggests that the proposed definition of investigation couldbe construed to require the Department to begin an entirely new investigationin the event of a resumption or continuation of the investigation followingits suspension. This party suggests that the definition of investigationbe amended as follows: ``an `investigation' begins, <T3>resumes or continues </T3>on the date * * * and ends, <T3>or is suspended, </T3>on the date * * *''<T3>Department's Position: </T3>On further reflection, we have deletedreference to notice of suspension of investigation as ``ending'' an investigation.We note that this regulation does not address the issue of what data orreview period is relevant for a continued or resumed investigation. Thestatute does not address this issue, and in our view, it must be decidedon a case-by-case basis.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.2(m)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, paragraph(m) defines ``the merchandise.'' The definition avoids continual repetitionthroughout the regulations of the phrase ``the class or kind of merchandiseimported or sold, or likely to be sold, for importation into the UnitedStates, that is the subject of the proceeding.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.2(o)</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>All but one party commenting on this section objectsto limiting ``parties to the proceeding'' to only those interested partiesthat actively participate in a particular decision by the Secretary throughthe submission of factual information or written argument. Many partiessuggest that the definition of ``party to the proceeding'' continue tobe defined as ``an interested party that has filed an entry of appearancewithin 10 days of the publication of a preliminary determination.'' Someparties argue that the proposed definition is an attempt by the Departmentto define the standing of persons to seek judicial review of agency decisions,and that such an attempt is an usurpation of the power of Congress. Oneparty also argues that the proposed definition undercuts the purpose ofthe revisions made in 1979 and 1984 to the trade laws, which made relieffrom unfair foreign trade practices easier and less costly for domesticindustries to obtain. Others argue that the provision is not in accordancewith Congress' intention of streamlining and reducing the cost of antidumpingduty proceedings, and will result in needless duplication of effort byinterested parties through protective filings.One party states that it does not necessarily disagree with the proposeddefinition, but questions the Department's authority to change the rulesof standing in any federal court.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department must define the term ``partyto the proceeding.'' Section 733(b)(2) of the Tariff Act provides for disclosureof information to ``any interested party, then a party to the proceedings* * *'' and section 777(c)(1)(A) of the Act, as amended by the 1988 Act,limits disclosure of business proprietary information to ``all interestedparties who are parties to the proceeding * * *.'' Furthermore, the term``party to the investigation,'' a term that the Department interprets asbeing synonymous with ``party to the proceeding,'' appears a number oftimes in the statute. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>section 774(a)(1), dealing with requests for hearings.As to the arguments that the Department is attempting to limit a party'sright to appeal to the court, we believe the comments prove too much. Itis the province of Congress to regulate trade, but that does not arguethat the Department has no authority to interpret statutory enactmentson trade matters through its regulations. Section 516A(d) of the Act limitsstanding before the Court to ``[a]ny interested party who was a party tothe proceeding under section 303 of this Act or title VII of this Act ** *.'' Those proceedings are administrative processes carried out beforethe Department and subject to its rules. We believe the Court will benefitfrom the agency's expertise as to the minimum participation in the administrativeprocess that will make possible the party's exhaustion of its administrativeremedies, so that the time of the Court and the parties will not needlesslybe spent on matters that could have been addressed and resolved by theagency in the first instance. The Court may disagree in the circumstancesof a particular case that adherence to the regulatory requirements wasconsistent with Congressional intent, but that does not argue for ignoringour obligation to ensure, to the extent possible, the orderly, efficient,and equitable implementation of the law.Finally, the Department does not believe that the definition places anunreasonable burden on interested parties. To the extent that parties wishto make clear their right to litigate issues raised by other parties, theymay incorporate by reference the other parties' comments in whole or inpart. If the parties' positions differ, then the Department believes thatthe second party has an obligation to raise its argument with the administeringauthority before litigating the issue.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.2(s)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>We have added a reference to U.S. price in the definitionof ``reseller'' and made other technical changes to clarify the languagein this paragraph.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.2(t)</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party states that the definition of ``likely sale''should not be limited to an ``irrevocable offer to sell,'' and suggestsmodifying the regulation either by dropping the requirement that offersbe irrevocable or by creating a rebuttable presumption that all offersare irrevocable. This party also proposes modifying the definition of ``likelysale'' to include oral offers that are not confirmed in writing. In addition,this party objects to the Department's practice (stated in the preambleto the proposed rule) of considering likely sales only in the event thatthere are no consummated sales in the relevant foreign markets. It contendsthat the Department's practice could result in a finding of no dumping,when in fact the presence of offers to sell in the market at less thanfair value (``LTFV'') may cause the domestic industry injury by forcingit to cut its prices accordingly, regardless of whether actual sales havebeen made.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department has defined the term ``likelysale'' in order to cover the situations where actionable unfair trade practicescan be reasonably expected to exist. The issue to be addressed is the likelihoodthat a sale will be made. In our view, that can occur only when an offeris irrevocable for some time period sufficient to indicate a likelihoodof sale. Revocable offers encompass such a wide spectrum of activitiesas to provide no measure of the likelihood of sales. We have decided toretain the requirement that offers be irrevocable, without adding a rebuttablepresumption, because we believe the provision is administrable and reasonableas drafted.Regarding the practice on consideration of likely sales, the Departmentcontinues to believe that sales generally are a more appropriate measureof market activity than are offers. The manner in which the Departmentdefines the period of the investigation will most often deal with the problemidentified by the commenter. In the unusual situation where that is notthe case, the Department may consider both sales and offers.Although all of the comments focused on the likely sale issue, we notethat section 1327 of the 1988 Act lists the factors to be considered indeciding whether a lease is equivalent to a sale. These factors are theterms of the lease, normal commercial practice within the industry, thecircumstances of the specific transaction, the integration of the productinto the operation of the lessee or importer, the likelihood of continuationor renewal of the lease over a significant period of time, and other relevantfactors, including the possibility of avoidance of antidumping or countervailingduties.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.3</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>Two parties request that respondents and petitionersnot be required to resubmit evidence or documents that are already in theDepartment's possession. To reduce the burden, the resubmission shouldbe waived if the submitter can identify the location of the requested datain the Department's files. These documents could be made part of the courtrecord without physically inserting them into the record.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The burden that would be created, and thepotential disruption to an orderly proceeding that would result, giventhe enormous volume of records, does not permit the Department to providethis service. <T3>See also </T3>andSection; 353.34(b)(3)(ii).We note that in paragraph (a) we have clarified that documents returnedto a submitter under andSection;andSection; 353.31(b)(2) and 353.32(g) willnot be included in the official record.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.3(b)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>To be consistent with changes made to the countervailingduty regulations, we have altered the second sentence of andSection; 353.3(b)to read as follows: ``The record will consist of all material describedin paragraph (a) of this section that the Secretary decides is public informationwithin the meaning of andSection; 353.4(a), government memoranda or portionsof memoranda that the Secretary decides may be disclosed to the generalpublic, plus public versions of all determinations, notices, and transcripts.''The Department believes this will clarify any ambiguity between andSection;353.3(b) and andSection; 353.4(a), as proposed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.4</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party suggests adding to the list of public information,with the burden on the submitter to establish the contrary, items suchas price lists distributed to a group of customers and price lists of componentsand raw materials if such lists generally are publicly available.Another party contends that the Department's proposed standards for proprietarytreatment of information are inadequate. This party argues that the useof a list to define proprietary information is flawed in that it is inflexibleand overly narrow, and should be abandoned. For example, under the regulation,factual information in a form that cannot be associated with or used toidentify a particular firm nonetheless may be proprietary for that firm.An example would be marketing strategies. This party suggests that paragraph(a)(3) and the exceptions in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(6) should be deleted.This party also suggests that the regulations should exclude from publicdisclosure or release under an APO any proprietary documents requestedas part of the response to a questionnaire.Another party suggests that the destination of sales and designation oftype of customers should be considered proprietary information.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Price lists may be public information ofa type described in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, or proprietaryinformation described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. We cannot presumethat limited distribution of a price list to a specific group of customersconstitutes public availability. For example, sellers may circulate differentprice lists to different groups of customers and expect prospective customersto protect the information as proprietary.The Department may deviate from the list of normally public informationif the submitter presents a convincing argument of harm. Rather than modifyandSection; 353.4(a)(3), we will entertain such arguments on a case-by-casebasis. Similarly, we will entertain on a case-by-case basis arguments againstthe parenthetical exceptions listed in andSection; 353.4(b). As we notedin the proposed rulemaking, the list of exceptions reflects our experiencewith information submitted in proceedings. It attempts to eliminate unnecessarydisagreement over documents that generally fall into one category or another.We note that, to be consistent with changes made to the countervailingduty regulations, we have amended andSection; 353.4(a)(4) to read ``publiclyavailable laws, regulations, decrees, orders, and other official documentsof a country, including English translations.'' This clarifies that officialdocuments containing proprietary, classified, or otherwise privileged informationare not considered to be public information. We also have revised the parentheticalphrase in paragraph (b)(6) so that it now reads ``designation of type ofcustomer, distributor, or supplier.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>These rules include the regulation promulgated on August17, 1987 (52 FR 30660) regarding <T3>de minimis</T3> dumping margins.

We agree that a certification requirement is an appropriatemeans of deterring the kind of problems described in this legislative history.However, we prefer to apply the certification requirement to all submissionsof factual information, not just to those contained in petitions. Accordingly,we are adding to andSection; 353.31 a new paragraph (i), which requires thatall submissions of factual information (as defined in andSection; 353.2(g))be accompanied by an appropriate certification of a responsible officialof the submitter and the submitter's legal counsel or other representative,if any.

This partysuggests clarifying ``reasonably available'' by revising the language toread ``The petition shall contain the following, to the extent reasonablyavailable to the petitioner under its individual circumstances:''.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>In deciding whether to initiate an investigation,the Department's practice is to take into account the ability of the petitionerto obtain information in support of the petition. The type and quantityof relevant information that is reasonably available to a large corporationin a well-defined industry may not be available to a small company in anemerging or less well-defined industry. The Department's practice of consideringthe size and nature of the business and industry in deciding what informationis ``reasonably available'' is not changed in this section. Moreover, thisrule contains a new paragraph (h) in andSection; 353.12 that specificallyprovides for technical assistance to small businesses.

For example,one party suggested that this section include a requirement that petitionersstate whether they represent a majority of the domestic industry in termsof (1) the volume and value of domestic production of the merchandise inquestion and (2) the number of firms manufacturing the merchandise in theUnited States. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>For purposes of the petition, the Departmentwill continue to rely on the petitioner's representation of industry support.Neither the statute nor the legislative history requires the petitionerto establish affirmatively that it has the support of a particular percentageof the members of an industry. <T3>See </T3>Department's response to comments on andSection; 353.2(j). We note that, to be consistent with changes made in the countervailingduty regulations, we have modified the parenthetical phrase in paragraph(b)(2) to clarify that two percent of the industry may be measured eitherin terms of sales or production levels. In addition, we have modified thisprovision to clarify that, in deciding whether a person in the industryaccounts for two percent or more of the industry, the petitioner may relyonly on publicly available information. The Department includes the twopercent cut-off to reduce the potential burden on the petitioner in industriesthat include a large number of small firms. In satisfying the requirementsof paragraph (b)(2), the Department does not expect petitioners to obtainbusiness proprietary information from other persons in the industry orotherwise to engage in activity that arguably might call into play theU.S. antitrust laws. We believe there are many methods of gathering theinformation that would not present a problem. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.12(b)(4) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party recommends deleting the word ``requested''because it gives the impression that the Department may expand or contractthe scope of investigation. The party argues that the Department does nothave the authority to modify the scope set forth in the petition. Another party states that the Department cannot modify the scope beyondthe description in the petition unless it follows the self-initiation procedure.Another party states that the Department's authority to modify the scopeof the petition is limited to instances in which the petitioner does notallege the pertinent facts or does not provide the requisite information.This party adds that the Department may self-initiate an investigationof products not specified in the petition if there is information in thepetition allowing it to do so. Otherwise, the scope of the investigationshould be controlled by the description of the merchandise found in thepetition. <T3>Department's Position:</T3> The Court of International Trade has acknowledgedthat the Department has authority to clarify the description of the classor kind of merchandise contained in the petition. <T3>Mitsubishi Electric Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States,</T3> Slip Op. 88-152, 12 CIT<T2>XX</T2>(October 31, 1988); <T3>Kokusai Electric Co. Ltd. </T3>v. <T3>United States,</T3> Slip Op. 86-29, 10 CIT<T2>XX</T2>(March 14, 1986). The Court also has recognized that the Departmenthas the authority to define the scope of an investigation. <T3>Diversified Products Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>6 CIT 155, 159 (1983) (citing <T3>Royal Business Machines </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>1 CIT 80, 87 n.18 (1980), <T3>aff'd, </T3>669 F.2d 691 (Fed. Cir. 1982)). This authority is importantfor the purpose of ensuring that the Department's orders are administrable,clear, enforceable, and adequate to protect the U.S. industry from theunfair trade practices covered by the statute. When defining the classor kind of merchandise, the Department may, for example, rely on informationnot available to the petitioner and conclude that the petitioner's statementof class or kind is inadequate to prevent easy circumvention of the order. We note that we have modified this paragraph to delete the reference tothe Tariff Schedules of the United States. The reference to ``U.S. tariffclassification'' in the final rule covers the Harmonized Tariff System,effective in the United States on January 1, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.12(b)(6)</ITAG><T3> Comment:</T3> One party objects to the requirement that petitionersprovide the proportion of total exports to the United States from eachperson alleged to have sold merchandise at less than fair value. They arguethat the information is often difficult or impossible for the petitionerto obtain, and that the requirement is contrary to Congressional intentto reduce the cost of filing a petition. They suggest that this requirementbe deleted.<T3> Department's Position:</T3> The Department uses information on exportsto the United States in the preparation of questionnaires and the reviewof questionnaire responses. Therefore, to the extent that this informationis reasonably available to the petitioner, it should be reported in thepetition. To the extent that it would be unduly burdensome, difficult,or impossible for a petitioner to obtain this information, the petitionwould be acceptable without it. As noted in the Department's position onparagraph (b)(2) of this section, the petitioner may rely on publicly availableinformation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.12(b)(7)</ITAG><T3> Comment:</T3> One party states that because the preferred methodologyfor calculating foreign market value is to use home market prices, theDepartment should expressly require that the petition contain informationon home market prices when ``reasonably available to the petitioner.''This party suggests adding the following language to this section: ``(Ifunable to furnish information on foreign sales or costs<T3> after reasonable effort </T3>* * *)''.<T3> Department's Position:</T3> The commenter is correct as to the preferredmethodology for calculating foreign market value. We note that the informationto be submitted is the factual information that is relevant to U.S. priceand foreign market value ``in accordance with Subpart D.'' That subpartevidences the preference for home market prices, third country prices,or constructed value, in that order. The Department will evaluate the adequacyof a petition in light of the preferences stated in Subpart D.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.12(b)(8)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> We are drafting a proposed rule and request for commentsto implement the 1988 Act amendments regarding dumping by nonmarket economycountries.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.12(d)<T3/></ITAG>Comment: One party argues that the Department should not dismiss a petitionbecause of information for which proprietary treatment is improperly claimedif that information is not essential to support the petition (as wouldhappen under the proposed requlation).

Otherwise, if the information which does not complywith andSection; 353.32 is essential, the Department would decide under andSection;353.13 that the petition does not properly allege the basis on which anantidumping duty may be imposed. Nevertheless, we agree that the choiceis the petitioner's and have revised paragraph (d) accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.12(g)</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> One party argues that the Department should notify notonly the country in which the merchandise is produced but also any countrythat the petition alleges is an intermediate country for the importationof the merchandise and is likely to be used to calculate foreign marketvalue.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> At the time a petition is filed, only thehome market country (or countries) is known for certain, which is why andSection;353.12(g) requires only that a representative of that country be served.The Department, however, will make a petition available to a representativeof an intermediate country if one is identified either in the petitionor during the course of the investigation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.12(i)</ITAG><T3> Comment:</T3> One party argues that this section is unnecessarilybroad in prohibiting, prior to initiation, oral or written communicationfrom interested parties regarding a petition. This party states that theparagraph on pre-initiation communications with the Department is morerestrictive than the decision of the Court of Appeals in <T3>United States v. Roses, Inc.,</T3> 706 F.2d 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1983).The commenter contends that the Department can consider communicationsregarding procedural defects in the petition (such as the standing of thepetitioner), provided that the communications are on the record and withadequate notice to petitioners. This party also believes the Departmentshould permit interested parties to bring to the Department's attentionmatters in the public domain.<T3> Department's Position:</T3> Paragraph (i) is consistent with the <T3>Roses</T3> decision. Paragraph (i) limits the restriction on communicationto interested parties defined in paragraphs (k)(1) or (k)(2) of andSection;353.2, which means that the Department will accept communications fromdomestic interested parties defined in paragraphs (k)(3) through (k)(6)of andSection; 353.2. The Court in<T3> Roses</T3> held that under no circumstances was the Department toengage in an advocacy proceeding based on information from potential respondentsat the pre-initiation stage of the proceeding. <T3>Id.</T3> at 1567. We believe that this holding precludes the Departmentfrom making fine distinctions between law and fact, procedure and substance,and from determining whether information is in the public domain, especiallybecause the Department would have to accept and review correspondence inorder to make such distinctions. Such a review of correspondence wouldlead to needless and time-consuming disputes as to whether the Departmenthad abided by the ruling in <T3>Roses</T3> in a particular case.We note that if a U.S. producer of the like product (andSection; 353.2(k)(3))or any other domestic party communicates with the Department as an agentof a potential respondent, the prohibition in paragraph (i) would applyto that communication. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.13 </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party suggests that the notice of initiation shouldclearly state the scope of the investigation. They add that this coveragecannot be extended later to merchandise not included in the notice of initiation,because to do so would deny the parties adequate notice. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Court of International Trade has recognizedthat the Department has the authority to define the scope of an investigation.<T3>Diversified Products Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>6 CIT 155, 159 (1983) (citing <T3>Royal Business Machines </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>1 CIT 80, 87 n.18 (1980), <T3>aff d, </T3>669 F.2d 691 (Fed. Cir. 1982)). The Department consultsclosely with the petitioner, the Commission, and others to ensure thatthe notice of initiation describes the scope of the investigation as accuratelyas possible. In certain circumstances, however, the scope of the investigationset forth in the notice of initiation must be expanded or contracted totake account of facts discovered after initiation. For example, the scopeof an investigation sometimes must be expanded to prevent circumvention.<T3>See, e.g., Mitsubishi Electric Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>Slip Op. 88-152, 12 CIT <T2>XX</T2> (October 31, 1988). In addition, the scope must be contractedwhen it is determined that a petitioner has not filed on behalf of an industrythat produces a particular like product previously included in the classor kind of merchandise subject to investigation. <T3>See, e.g., Oil Country Tubular Goods from IsraeI, </T3>52 FR 1649,(1987); <T3>Certain Textile Mill Products and Apparel from Sri Lanka, </T3>50 FR9826 (1985). Moreover, the scope of an investigation and any antidumpingorder that results is subject to clarification of its intended coverage.<T3>Gold Star Co., Ltd. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>Slip Op. 88-102, 12 CIT <T2>XX</T2> (July 29, 1988); <T3>Kokusai Electric Co., Ltd. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>Slip Op. 86-29, 10 CIT <T2>XX</T2> (March 14, 1986). In the event it becomes necessary for theDepartment to modify or clarify the scope of an investigation, it is theDepartment's practice to inform all parties to the proceeding. If the Departmentdid not modify or clarify the scope when warranted, the interests of allparties could be seriously jeopardized. <T3>See also </T3>the Department's response to comments on andSection; 353.12(b)(4).<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.14 </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>Several parties comment that the 30-day time limit onsubmission of requests for exclusion is too short. Some companies may notlearn about the investigation in 30 days or, even if they do, may not havetime to prepare the request described in this section. One party arguesthat elimination of the possibility of requesting an exclusion after the30-day period will deny interested parties the right to have the circumstancesof their transactions analyzed. These parties suggest the time limit beextended to the date when the questionnaire response is due. Two parties contend that the requirement that certification of the requestbe obtained within the 30-day time limit is totally unrealistic, and thatthis certification is unnecessary and could serve to deter meritoriousrequests for exclusion. One party requests clarification as to when a firm may be excluded underan antidumping order, <T3>i.e., </T3>will a company be excluded automatically if the Departmentdetermines that it has no dumping margin during the investigatory periodor must it formally apply for exclusion. Two parties suggest that the Departmentautomatically exclude from a final determination all companies investigatedand found to be receiving zero (<T3>de minimis</T3>) dumping margins. Two parties suggest that notices of initiation should list the companiesto whom questionnaires will be sent and clearly state that any foreignproducer or reseller not listed which wishes to be excluded should submita request within the specified time limit. These parties urge that thosecompanies that do request exclusion and submit a questionnaire responsewithin the time limits must be investigated. Any company submitting a questionnaireresponse and not investigated should be given a zero dumping duty depositrate if an antidumping duty order is issued. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The deadline for submission of requestsfor exclusion is 50 days from the date the petition is filed, because initiationnormally occurs on the 20th day after the petition is filed. In most cases,50 days should be a reasonable period of time for preparation of the request.The Department cannot extend the deadline for filing requests for exclusionbeyond the 30-day period set forth in the proposed rule, because it mustdecide by that date, or shortly thereafter, which companies it will investigateand to which it will send questionnaires. If the certifications were notsubmitted until the deadline for submitting questionnaire responses, theDepartment would not have sufficient time to issue questionnaires, analyzeresponses, and prepare for verification.The certifications in this section are required in order to ensure thatthe requests are carefully considered by all parties that have relevantinformation. These certification requirements are analogous to those requiredunder andSection; 353.25(b) for revocations. The certifications are requiredin order to justify the Department's decision to conduct an investigationspecifically of the company submitting the request for exclusion, an investigationit might not otherwise conduct. Neither questionnaire responses nor verificationserve the same purpose as certifications. If the Department includes a producer or reseller in its investigationand determines that the producer or reseller had no dumping margin duringthe period of investigation, the Department would automatically excludethat producer or reseller from the antidumping duty order, even if theproducer or reseller did not request exclusion under the procedures describedin this section. The purpose of this section merely is to provide an opportunityfor producers and resellers that the Department might not otherwise includein its investigation to request that the Department specifically includeand investigate them. If the Department investigates the company on othergrounds, no purpose would be served by an exclusion request. The Department cannot specify in the notice of initiation which companiesit will investigate because the 20-day pre-initiation period is an insufficientamount of time to decide which companies will be investigated. Indeed,the Department often cannot identify all producers or resellers at thetime of initiation. We agree, however, with the suggestion that initiationnotices should specify the date for filing exclusion requests, and willmodify future initiation notices accordingly. When the Department receives requests for exclusion that comply with therequirements of this section, the Department normally will investigatethe requests in accordance with the investigatory procedures describedin other sections of this part. For example, the Department will ask eachparty requesting exclusion to answer a questionnaire, submit to verification,and abide by the procedures on information and argument in Subpart C ofthis part. As explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, the phrase ``to theextent practicable'' would permit the Department to refuse to investigateone or more of the requests when it concludes that it could not do so withinthe statutory time limits on investigations. Such refusal might occur,for example, in a case in which an extraordinarily large number of requestsfor exclusion are submitted. If the Department refuses to investigate arequest for exclusion, the requester may be excluded from the antidumpingduty order by requesting a revocation under andSection; 353.25(b). Neitherthe GATT nor U.S. law requires the Department to investigate every requestfor exclusion or every company that produces or exports the class or kindof merchandise under investigation. For the same reasons, we cannot assigna zero rate to companies that submit a voluntary response but are not investigated.If a company is found during an administrative review to have no dumpingmargin, any cash deposit will be refunded with interest.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.15</ITAG><T3> Comment:</T3> Two parties suggest that the basis for a preliminarydetermination should remain as ``best information available,'' rather thanthe proposed change to ``available information.'' One of these partiessuggests that when respondents cooperate in the investigation, the bestinformation available is the respondent's reply to the questionnaire whenverification occurs after the preliminary determination. In addition, one party recommends that when a petitioner requests a postponementof the preliminary determination, the Department should conduct verificationprior to the preliminary determination. Another party suggests that theproposed regulation should require verification before a preliminary determinationin all but exceptional circumstances. This party  argues that the methodologiesused in a final determination often are not focused on until after verification;if verification occurs after the preliminary determination, parties willnot be able to comment on the methodologies used in the final determination,which will continue to foster more court appeals. One party suggests that the Department be required to issue and publisha corrected preliminary determination as soon as it discovers clericalerror.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Section 776 (b) and (c) of the Act andandSection; 353.37 of these regulations specify the limited conditions inwhich the Department may use ``best information available'' in lieu ofinformation submitted by respondents. As explained in the preamble to theproposed rule, paragraph (a) of this section refers to ``available information''in order to indicate that the Department may base its preliminary determinationon any information available to it at the time. ``Available information''includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the respondent's submissions.For example, even prior to verification, the Department may know that respondent'ssubmissions are incomplete or demonstrably incorrect. In that event, theDepartment may use apparently reliable information from other sources.Whenever there are adequate time and resources for verification prior toa preliminary determination, the Department will conduct the verificationprior to the date of the preliminary determination in order to make itspreliminary determination more accurate. In practice, the Department usuallyconducts verification after the preliminary determination, even when thepetitioner requests an extension of the date for the preliminary determination.Normally the petitioner requests an extension for the purpose of permittingthe Department to obtain additional information from the respondent. Preparationof the supplemental questionnaires and submission and review of responsesconsumes 25 to 45 days of the extension period. Verification is conductedonly after the Department has provided each respondent with an adequateopportunity to submit the information requested by the Department. Theon-site verification, including associated preparation and report-writing,normally requires 30 to 40 days. Because the period of the extension underparagraph (c) of this section is not more than 50 days, there is in mostcases insufficient time for verification prior to the date of the preliminarydetermination. Facts available to the Department at an early stage of the investigationare limited in comparison with those available later in the investigation.Preliminary determinations are simply interim decisions intended to focusissues and provide the basis for comment by the parties to the proceeding.They are not subject to judicial review. One important effect of a finaldetermination is to correct inaccuracies in the preliminary determination.Therefore, an additional procedure for correcting errors in a preliminarydetermination would be an unwarranted waste of the Department's scarceresources. We have established a practice of correction of clerical errorsin final determinations and final results, which also is provided for insection 1333 of the 1988 Act. <T3>See </T3>53 FR 41617 (October 24, 1988); 53 FR 5813 (February 26, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.15(a) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party suggests that paragraph (a)(2)(i) should bemodified to indicate that preliminary determinations will include administrativeand judicial precedents on which legal conclusions are founded. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The suggestion that the Secretary's determinationrecite legal precedent would impose a burden not required by the statute.To the extent necessary to explain the determination, the Department doesdiscuss legal precedents in its preliminary determinations. In view ofthe fact that the preliminary determination is not subject to judicialreview and is subject to revision in the final determination, any additionaldiscussion of administrative and judicial precedents is unnecessary. We note that because section 733(b) of the Act provides that the Departmentmust have a reasonable basis to believe ``or suspect'' that merchandiseis being sold, or is likely to be sold, at less than fair value, we haveadded the words ``or suspect'' to paragraph (a) of the regulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.15(b) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party suggests that paragraph (b) should provide,as an additional reason for postponement, the consideration of requestsfor exclusion or ``the calculation of individual margins for one or moreproducers or exporters.'' Another party suggests that requests for postponements in extraordinarilycomplicated cases should be available to petitioners and respondents onan equal basis. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department's authority to extend thetime limit for issuing a preliminary determination is ``narrowly circumscribed''by the statutory criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(2). <T3>See </T3>S. Rep. No. 249, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 66 (1979). Section733(c)(1)(B) of the Act does not permit consideration of additional criteriafor allowing an extension of time. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.15(g) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>Two parties suggest that the disclosure conference shouldprovide a ``complete,'' rather than a ``further,'' explanation of the preliminarydetermination. These parties urge the Department to disclose all calculationsand computer programs used in making the determination. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We have clarified that the purpose of disclosureis only to provide an explanation of the calculation methodology used ina determination. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.16(a)</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party contends that the Department does not havestatutory authority to self-initiate an investigation of critical circumstances,and that the Department should not substitute its perception of what isin the petitioner's interest for that of the petitioner.<T3> Department's Position:</T3> Although section 733(e) does not expresslyauthorize the Department to find critical circumstances in self-initiatedinvestigations, the Department in such cases is considered the petitionerand, as such, has authority to allege and to investigate critical circumstances.Under a similar interpretation of the statute, the Department has determinedthat in a self-initiated investigation the administering authority is the``petitioner'' and may, in appropriate circumstances, withdraw its petitionand terminate the investigation. <T3>See, e.g., Certain Steel Products from Belgium, Brazil, France, Romania,South Africa, and Spain,</T3> 47 FR 5754 (1982). An interpretation of thelaw that would exclude critical circumstances from the purview of self-initiatedinvestigations would be inconsistent with the Congressional desire forvigorous enforcement of the unfair trade laws.<T3> See, e.g.,</T3> H.R. Rep. No. 317, 96th Cong., lst Sess. 51 (1979).<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.16(b)</ITAG><T3> Comment:</T3> One party notes that under proposed andSection; 353.16(b),the Department cannot make a preliminary finding of critical circumstancesand suspend liquidation until it has issued its preliminary determination.This party contends that such a delay in making a critical circumstancesdetermination is contrary to the statutory purpose underlying the criticalcircumstances provisions of the antidumping law, <T3>i.e.,</T3> the deterrence of import surges through the Department'sprompt determination of whether critical circumstances exist. The partynotes, however, that under the GATT Antidumping Code, provisional measures,including the suspension of liquidation, cannot be implemented until anaffirmative preliminary determination of dumping has been made. This partysuggests, therefore, that the Department revise this section to providethat, if an allegation of critical circumstances is submitted with thepetition, or within 60 days of the filing of the petition, and is deemedto warrant investigation, the Department will make a preliminary determinationon an expedited basis, will delay verification until after the preliminarydetermination, and will provide no extensions to respondents for purposesof submitting information to consider in making a preliminary determination.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We have revised paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (c),and (g) to permit the Department to issue a preliminary critical circumstancesfinding before the date of the preliminary determination under andSection;353.15 in appropriate cases. (We note that this requirement also is providedin section 1324 of the 1988 Act.) If a preliminary critical circumstancesfinding is made before the date of the preliminary determination, suspensionof liquidation will take effect only at the time of, and in the event of,an affirmative preliminary determination. In order to make an affirmativepreliminary finding of critical circumstances, the Department must find:(1) that there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhereof the merchandise, or that the importer knew or should have known thatthe producer or reseller was selling the merchandise at LTFV; and (2) asexplained in the Department's position on comments on paragraphs (f) and(g), that imports have increased significantly during a relatively shortperiod. A ``relatively short period'' is defined in paragraph (g) as normallyat least the three-month period beginning either on the date the proceedingbegins or, when appropriate, a period of not less than three months fromthe date prior to the initiation of the proceeding on which importers orexporting producers or resellers had reason to believe that a proceedingwas likely. Because the preliminary determination in an antidumping investigationgenerally is not issued until the 160th day of the investigation, the Departmentexamines at least a three-month period when determining whether criticalcircumstances exist (as opposed to approximately a three-month period ina countervailing duty investigation).For example, in the recent antidumping investigation of <T3>Butadiene Acrylonitrile Copolymer Synthetic Rubber from Japan, </T3>53FR 15436 (1988), we examined a five-month period in determining the existenceof critical circumstances, because of the longer time period between initiationof an antidumping investigation and the preliminary determination, as comparedto the time period in countervailing duty  investigations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.16(c) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>We have modified paragraph (c) to provide that the suspensionof liquidation that results from a finding under this section will be madeonly  at the time of, or after, an affirmative preliminary determinationunder andSection; 353.15. <T3>See </T3>Department's response to comments on andSection; 353.16(b).In addition, we have revised this paragraph to clarify that suspensionof liquidation would apply only to entries covered by the affirmative criticalcircumstances finding. We also have made technical changes to paragraph(c) to clarify the language of this paragraph. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.16(d) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>Two parties contend that neither the Department nor theCustoms Service has authority to order the retroactive collection of acash deposit or posting of a bond, and that the Department's authorityin the event of a preliminary affirmative critical circumstances decisionis limited to ordering the retroactive suspension of liquidation. Theseparties suggest, therefore, that we delete the reference in paragraph (d)to cash deposit and bond, and clarify that an affirmative finding of criticalcircumstances does not result in retroactive collection of deposits orposting of bonds. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The authority to impose retroactively abond or cash deposit requirement is stated by implication in section 735(c)(3)(B) and (c)(4) of the Act. If Congress did not intend retroactivebonding or cash deposits, these provisions of the Act would be superfluousbecause there would be nothing to release or refund. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.16(e) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party suggests that the Department should be subjectto the same time limits for making findings in self-initiated investigations(paragraph (e)) as in investigations based on petitions (paragraphs (b)and (d)), because the same standard for determining critical circumstancesapplies to all investigations. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>Paragraph (e) provides that the time limitsrelating to the submission of critical circumstances allegations by thepetitioner do not apply in self-initiated investigations. This paragraphgives the Department maximum flexibility to make critical circumstancesfindings early in self-initiated investigations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.16(f) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>Several parties advocate elimination of the referencein paragraph (f) to a 15 percent increase in imports over imports duringan ``immediately preceding'' period. They contend that a 15 percent increasein imports is not necessarily indicative of circumventing behavior thatwould warrant application of the retroactivity provisions of the law. Theynote that such an increase could reflect normal commercial responses tochanged market conditions, to normal business growth, or to compliancewith contracts entered into months earlier. Some of these parties believethat application of the 15 percent standard, even though it is not an absolutestandard, may lead to arbitrary results and may discourage importations.On the other hand, one of these parties emphasizes that in some cases (eventhose in which imports have not accounted for a preponderance of U.S. apparentconsumption) the 15 percent standard may be too high. Several parties object to the statement in the preamble of the proposedrule that in cases where imports account for a ``preponderance'' of U.S.apparent consumption, an increase in imports of less than 15 percent maybe massive. One party argues that market share is irrelevant to the issueof whether imports are ``massive,'' and believes it is inappropriate topenalize, by using a lower threshold for invoking the critical circumstancesprovision, imports that have achieved a large share of the market withoutsome evidence that their share is the result of dumping. Another partyargues that there is a discrepancy between the explanation of andSection;353.16(f) and the language of the regulation itself with respect to theincreased import amounts. Specifically, this party seeks clarificationas to the provision in the proposed regulation that states the Secretarywill not consider imports massive unless they have increased by ``at least15 percent'' and the statement in the preamble to the proposed rule that``the Secretary might consider the imports massive, even if the increaseis less than 15 percent * * *.'' Some of the parties that object to the 15 percent standard suggest droppingit in favor of a completely <T3>ad hoc </T3>analysis based on consideration of historical and seasonalimport patterns and other factors relevant to the decision whether theincrease in imports is an attempt to circumvent the law. One party suggeststhat if the Department retains the 15 percent standard, the Departmentshould provide that any increase of less than 15 percent (even if importsaccounted for a preponderance of U.S. apparent consumption) will not beconsidered massive. Another party suggests adding to paragraph (f) a statementthat any interested party may submit evidence to rebut the presumptioncreated by the 15 percent general rule. That party also would delete thereference to ``immediately preceding period'' and would insert referenceto a longer historical period, preferably three years. Other parties suggestraising the 15 percent standard to 25 or 50 percent, or adding a requirementthat the increase also must have accounted for five percent of total consumption.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Neither the Act nor the legislative historydefines ''massive imports.'' The Department, however, has concluded forthe following reasons that, in order to be ``massive,'' imports must increasesignificantly in relation to prior import levels or U.S. apparent consumption:(1) section 733(e)(1)(B) of the Act requires ``massive imports * * * overa <T3>relatively short period</T3>,'' a test that appears to require a surgein imports over ``normal'' levels; (2) the purpose of the critical circumstancesprovision is to prevent circumvention of the law, a purpose that presupposesan increase in import activity associated with the possibility of assessmentof antidumping duties; and (3) the requirement is consistent with the Department'sestablished practice in defining the term ``massive imports.'' The degreeof increase required logically would depend to some extent on the sizeof the import volume in relation to total U.S. apparent consumption. Moreover,the Department would consider an argument in a particular case that itis unreasonable to infer that the increase in imports is attributable tothe filing of a petition or the expectation of the filing of a petition.As noted in the preamble to the proposed rule, ``[t]he criteria describedin the proposed rule are intended to clarify the bases for the Secretary'scritical circumstances findings without adversely affecting the Secretary'sadministrative discretion.'' 51 FR 29049 (1986). Any interested party maysubmit information to establish that an increase of less than 15 percentis massive or that an increase of more than 15 percent is not massive underthe circumstances. For example, a party may argue that a 15 percent increaseis not massive in the case of a new product where the market for the productis expanding rapidly. Any interested party may also submit informationshowing that the increase is a seasonal import trend unrelated to the filingof the petition. The 15 percent benchmark is not intended to limit theDepartment's discretion or responsibility to consider in each case thefactors relevant to a decision regarding whether imports are ``massive.''Paragraph (f) uses the 15 percent benchmark as a general rule_it is merelya rough guide that gives some element of predictability to the process.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.16(g)</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>Two parties believe that the portion of this paragraphthat permits the Department to extend the length of the ``relatively shortperiod,'' if the Department finds that importers or exporters ``had reasonto believe'' that a ``proceeding was likely,'' is not consistent with theCongressional purpose to deter import surges during the period betweeninitiation of an investigation and a preliminary determination. One ofthese parties also believes the provision is anticompetitive. Several partiesbelieve that the provision is subjective and unadministrable.Although one party favors deletion of this provision, another party advocatesrevising paragraph (g) to include a list of objective criteria for theDepartment to refer to when deciding whether the importers or exportershad ``reason to believe'' that a ``proceeding was likely.''<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Neither the statute nor the legislativehistory defines the phrase ``relatively short period.'' The definitionin paragraph (g) is consistent with the Congressional purpose of deterringimport surges prior to suspension of liquidation that can be attributedto an effort to circumvent the effect of the law. The House Report statesthat the purpose is to ``deter exporters whose merchandise is subject toan investigation from circumventing the intent of the law by increasingtheir exports to the United States during the period between initiationof an investigation and a preliminary determination by the Authority.''H.R. Rep. No. 317, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 63 (1979). We believe that Congressintended that there be a benchmark period unaffected by the possibilityof the imposition of antidumping duties. If the importers, or exportingproducers or resellers, had knowledge that an investigation would be initiated,that period must be prior to initiation. In order to accomplish this purposeby issuing an affirmative critical circumstances finding at the earliestpossible moment during the investigation, the Department must have thediscretion to compare the level of imports during the surge period withthe level of imports during the benchmark period.In applying this provision, the Department will carefully evaluate allavailable information in order to eliminate the possibility of chillinglegitimate trade and competition from abroad. For example, the Departmentwould examine historical and seasonal trends to determine whether the increasein imports during the ``relatively short period'' is normal and appropriate.At this time, the Department has had insufficient experience with thisprovision to establish a definitive list of criteria for deciding whetherimporters or exporting producers or resellers had ``reason to believe''that a ``proceeding was likely.'' When appropriate, we will develop sucha list.We note that we have revised this paragraph to permit the Department, whenappropriate, to issue a critical circumstances finding prior to the dateof the Department's preliminary determination under andSection; 353.15.<T3> See</T3> Department's response to comments on andSection; 353.16(b).<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.17(a)</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> One party is concerned that the proposed rule does notensure an adequate basis for the Department to evaluate the public interestunder this paragraph. This party recommends revising paragraph (a) to requirepetitioners, on withdrawal of a petition, to certify whether they haveknowledge of, or reason to believe that there is, any agreement by theforeign government or the industry of the country subject to the investigationto restrain export prices or quantities to the United States, or whetherany such restraints have been, or are expected to be, implemented as aninducement to withdrawal of the petition. If the certification is affirmative,before terminating the investigation, the Department should follow theprocedures for the public interest determination that are set forth inparagraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The certification requirement proposedby the commenter is unnecessary. The obligation to consider the publicinterest gives the Department sufficient authority to obtain from interestedparties all relevant information concerning withdrawal of petitions. Therequirement that the Department consider whether a termination agreementserves the public interest derives from the 1979 legislative history ofsection 734(a) of the Act, which states, ``The committee intends that aninvestigation be terminated under section 734(a) only if the authorityor the ITC, as the case may be, determines that termination will servethe public interest.'' S. Rep. No. 249, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 70-71 (1979).This requirement was articulated in andSection; 353.41(a) of the currentregulations and is carried over into this paragraph. If withdrawal is infact based on a quantitative restraint agreement, the Department appliesthe provisions in paragraph (b) of andSection; 353.17. Those provisions implementthe 1984 amendment to section 734(a) of the Act, which provides more detailedpublic interest criteria for terminations based on quantitative restraintagreements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.17(b)</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> One party suggests clarifying in paragraph (b)(2) thatthe Department will consult with other U.S. Government agencies beforemaking the public interest determination.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Paragraph (b)(2) restates the statutoryrequirement set forth in section 734(a)(2)(C) of the Act. As a matter ofpractice, the Department consults with other agencies, when appropriate,on issues affecting the public interest determination under this paragraph.<T3>See also </T3>andSection; 353.38(a). <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.18(c) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>We have made technical changes to paragraph (c) to clarifythe language of this paragraph. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.18(d) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party believes it is important to enhance the abilityof the domestic industry to influence the Department's decision whether``extraordinary circumstances,'' as defined in this paragraph, exist. Anaffirmative decision is based in part on a finding that ``suspension ofthe investigation will be more beneficial to the industry than continuationof the investigation.'' The party recommends requiring the foreign respondentand the government to submit any proposed suspension agreement at the timethey submit the questionnaire response. The domestic parties then wouldhave 14 days to comment and indicate their willingness to accept the agreement.If a majority of the domestic producers (in terms of volume of sales) orimporters do not indicate acceptance, the suspension agreement should notbe pursued. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The legislative history of section 734(c)(2)of the Act states that ``the language of the statute is general so as toprovide the Authority with flexibility in administering the provision.However, the provision is not intended to be so general as to be meaningless.''H.R. Rep. No. 317, 96th Cong., lst Sess. 65 (1979). The Department recognizes the importance of obtaining the views of thedomestic industry in deciding whether ``extraordinary circumstances'' exist.We believe, however, that more than a one-time head count of proponentsand opponents (even if weighted by volume of sales) is required for theDepartment to make a reasonable decision on this issue. The Department'spreliminary conclusion about whether suspension would be beneficial tothe domestic industry should focus more on the concept of suspension ingeneral than on the specific language of an initial draft agreement. Thecomments and views of all interested parties regarding specific draft proposals,and even suspension itself, may change significantly as the investigationprogresses. Moreover, to the extent practicable, all interested parties should havethe opportunity to evaluate the possibility of a suspension of investigationin light of the Department's preliminary determination under andSection;353.15, an opportunity that would not exist under the requirements describedby the commenter. Under andSection; 353.18(g), the Department consults withthe petitioner and affords the petitioner a right to comment on specificdraft language. The Department concludes an agreement only if it determinesthat the agreement is in the public interest, including the interest ofthe domestic industry. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.18(e) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party comments that, in order to ensure that effectivemonitoring of an agreement is practicable, this paragraph should be revised.Specifically, this party objects that the second sentence of paragraph(e) relieves the Department of the obligation to collect pricing informationnecessary for the effective monitoring of suspension agreements, and urgesthat it be deleted. Rather, the Department should require foreign respondentsto submit on a quarterly basis the price at which they sell the merchandisein the U.S. and home markets, indicating any change from the period originallyinvestigated. This information should be accompanied by a listing of claimedadjustments and the extent to which the adjustments differ from the periodoriginally investigated. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>Although the Department recognizes theimportance of effective monitoring, we have not adopted the commenter'ssuggestion. Paragraph (g)(2)(i) provides that each suspension agreementshall contain a statement of the procedures for monitoring compliance withthe agreement. The monitoring provisions of each agreement specify thetypes of information to be submitted. In practice, the Department requiressubmission of relevant information on a quarterly basis. The Departmentmay consider it necessary to require all of the information identifiedby the commenter, but does not believe it is necessary or appropriate torequire such information in cases where it is not needed. The second sentence of paragraph (e) does not relieve the Department ofits obligation to monitor effectively each suspension agreement. If appropriate,the Department will obtain price information described in that sentence.The regulation merely states that the Department is not obligated to collectsuch information on a continuing basis. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.18(f) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party suggests that the phrase ``elimination of salesat less than fair value'' should be deleted from this section, becauseparagraph (a)(2) only applies to the complete cessation of exports anddoes not apply to suspension agreements that would eliminate LTFV sales.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We have deleted the reference to the phrase``elimination of sales at less than fair value.'' <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.18(g)(1) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>Two parties suggest that proposed suspension agreementsshould be permitted within 30 days, rather than 45 days, of a final determination.Thirty days would provide sufficient time to comment on and to considera proposed suspension agreement, and would allow respondents additionaltime to seek an agreement.Another party notes that this paragraph continues to permit the Departmentto suspend an investigation up to the date of its final determination,even though the purpose of a suspension agreement is to permit rapid resolutionof antidumping cases, with a minimum expenditure of resources by all partiesinvolved. The party recommends that paragraph (g)(1) be changed to requirethat: (1) foreign respondents and governments submit any proposed suspensionagreement no later than the date on which they submit their responses tothe Department's questionnaire; (2) the domestic interested parties begiven a reasonable time thereafter to comment on the proposed agreement;and (3) the Department make a final decision on the proposed suspensionagreement not later than the scheduled date for the preliminary determination.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The 45-day time limit in this paragraphestablishes the minimum amount of time the Department requires to reviewa proposed agreement and to provide the 30-day notice to the petitionerrequired under paragraph (2)(i). This time limit also affords ample timefor the Department to prepare the final determination. The statute and legislative history clearly permit the Department to concludea suspension agreement any time prior to its final determination. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>S. Rep. No. 249, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 68-69 (1979).The purpose of permitting suspension of investigations is, as the commenternotes, to permit ``rapid and pragmatic resolutions of antidumping dutycases.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 71. <T3>See also </T3>H.R. Rep. No. 317, 96th Cong. lst Sess. 63-64 (1979).In practice, however, it is difficult to reach a pragmatic resolution ofcases, especially complex cases, in significantly less time than that allowedby the statute. The Department proceeds cautiously in signing suspensionagreements to ensure that all statutory criteria, including the publicinterest criteria, are satisfied. Therefore, we have not adopted the suggestionthat suspension agreements be concluded no later than the preliminary determination.Although the third commenter's proposals would ensure an early resolutionof the question whether a suspension agreement is attainable, it wouldnot ensure a ``rapid and pragmatic resolution of antidumping duty cases.''The proposal would impose time limits much shorter than those permittedby statute. As a result, the prospects of reaching an agreement on suspensionwould be severely reduced by the lack of time to consider and to negotiatea solution to issues associated with the proposed suspension agreement.The regulation as drafted is more consistent with the statute, legislativehistory, and the Department's experience. We note that, to be consistent with changes made to the countervailingduty regulations, we have modified paragraph (g)(1) to clarify that theservice requirement only applies to a proposed agreement preliminarilyaccepted by the Department. Draft proposed suspension agreements submittedto the Department on or before the 45th day for review under paragraph(g)(1) need not be served on other interested parties. We also are amendingandSection; 353.31(g) specifically to exempt submissions under paragraph(g)(1)(i) from the general service requirements. The 15-day period betweenthe deadline for submission of an initial draft agreement (paragraph (g)(1)(i))and service of an agreement preliminarily accepted by the Department tothe petitioner and other interested parties (paragraphs (g)(1)(ii) and(g)(2)(i)) is intended to give the Department, not interested parties,an opportunity to review and, if appropriate, suggest modifications tothe proposed agreement. The petitioner and other interested parties haveample opportunity to comment beginning on the date specified in paragraph(g)(2)(i). <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.18(g)(2)(i) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party proposes that this section be modified to indicatethat when the Department is aware, or has reason to believe, that anotherU.S. Government agency may be interested in commenting on a proposed suspensionagreement, that agency will be notified at the same time notice is givento parties to the proceeding. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department makes every effort to ensurethat other U.S. Government agencies will have an opportunity to commenton proposed suspension agreements. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.18(g)(2) and (g)(3) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party states that the consultation requirement inparagraph (g)(2)(ii) should provide explicitly that, on request by thepetitioner, the Department will meet and discuss with the petitioner theproposed suspension agreement. This party believes that, although the consultationrequirement is stated in the current regulations, the Department has interpretedthe requirement to be satisfied by allowing the petitioner to submit writtencomments on the agreement. Regarding paragraph (g)(3), one party suggests changing the deadline forsubmitting written argument and factual information from five days to atleast two weeks prior to the final determination, in order to provide adequatetime for consideration of the submissions. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The regulation as drafted addresses thecommenter's concerns. Paragraph (g)(2)(ii) provides for consultation andparagraph (g)(3) provides for submission of written argument and factualinformation concerning the proposed suspension agreement. The regulationdraws a clear distinction between the two types of communication. As amatter of practice, the Department affords the petitioner in each casethe opportunity for ``complete disclosure and discussion.'' S. Rep. No.249, 96th Cong., lst Sess. 71 (1979).We agree that five days allows the Department too little time in whichto consider written argument and factual information. Accordingly, we havechanged paragraph (g)(3) to establish the deadline for submissions as 10days prior to the final determination. To limit the deadline to two weeks,as suggested, would unnecessarily restrict the Department's access to relevantinformation and argument. The Department would sign a suspension agreementprior to the scheduled date for the final determination only after theDepartment has given all parties their opportunity to consult and commenton the proposed agreement. This paragraph necessarily establishes onlythe maximum conceivable time limit on submissions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.18 (i) and (j)</ITAG><T3> Comment:</T3> One party suggests that paragraph (i)(2) include a statementof the effect of a negative final determination by the Department or theCommission. Regarding paragraph (j), one party contends that there is no statutoryauthority for prohibiting entry of merchandise, as provided in paragraph(j)(2). This party believes that imports in excess of the limits in a quantityrestriction agreement are merely a violation of the agreement, and shouldbe treated as such under andSection; 353.19.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The effect of a negative final determinationby the Department or the Commission is stated in andSection; 353.17(c). Weare adding to this paragraph, however, a sentence to clarify the effectof a negative final determination on the suspension agreement, in accordancewith section 734(f)(3)(A) of the Act.The Department may order Customs to limit or exclude entry of merchandiseunder paragraph (j)(2) and may also determine under andSection; 353.19 thatthe agreement has been violated. Paragraph (j)(2) is necessary for theDepartment to ensure that exports in excess of the quantity allowed byparagraph (f) or by an agreement under paragraph (a) do not enter the UnitedStates for consumption. This authority is implicit in the Act because Congresscould not have intended for these agreements to be unenforceable.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.19(a)</ITAG><T3> Comment:</T3> Two parties object to this paragraph because it providesthat, ``without right of comment,'' the Department may determine that thesignatory exporters have violated an agreement and take enforcement action.They believe that fairness and due process require right of comment beforethe contractual agreement is abrogated. One party argues that it is highlyunlikely that a delay sufficient to allow an affected party an opportunityto explain its actions will have any measurable effect on the U.S. economyor the health of any industry.<T3> Department's Position:</T3> As stated in the preamble to the proposedrule, ``The Secretary would use the `fast track' approach in paragraph(a) when the Secretary decides that the record shows clear evidence ofviolation by any signatory exporter and that notice and comment are unnecessary.''51 FR 29050 (August 13, 1986). There is no unfairness or violation of dueprocess when the Department's determination is based on facts in the recordof the case that establish that the exporters have failed to comply withthe terms of the agreement by their own act or omission. This regulationis consistent with the statute and legislative history. We note that, to be consistent with changes made in the countervailingduty regulations, we are revising paragraph (a)(4) by deleting the phrase``if appropriate'' and inserting in its place ``if the Secretary determinesthat the violation was intentional.'' This change clarifies that the Departmentwill refer the violation to the U.S. Customs Service when the Departmentconsiders that the agreement was intentionally violated.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.19(b)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> We have modified paragraph (b)(1) to clarify that this paragraphapplies when the Secretary does not have sufficient information to takeaction under paragraph (a) of this section.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To be consistent with changes made to the countervailing duty regulations,we have added the phrase ``and after consideration of comments received,''before the phrase ``the Secretary will'' in paragraph (b)(2).

We have amended paragraph (b)(2)(ii) to reflect that intentionmore clearly. We also have corrected the references to section 734(d)(1)of the Act in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (b)(2)(ii)(C); the correct citationis to section 734(d) of the Act. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.19(d)</ITAG><T3> Comment:</T3> Two parties believe the proposed definition of ``violation''is inconsistent with section 734(i) and the legislative history of theAct to the extent that it defines a violation in terms of ``significant''noncompliance. These parties believe that any violation of an agreementmust be treated as a violation, not just those which the Department considerssignificant. In contrast, one party expresses agreement with the proposeddefinition of ``violation,'' because it clarifies that insignificant actsor omissions will not be considered violations.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The purpose of the definition of ``violation''is not to permit the Department to ignore noncompliance or equate ``significantnoncompliance'' with ``intentional violations,'' but to distinguish noncompliancethat warrants termination of the agreement from noncompliance that is <T3>de minimis.</T3> This is similar to the distinction in contract lawbetween ``material'' and ``immaterial'' breach. The word ``significant''is too vague to accomplish this purpose. Therefore, we are modifying thedefinition to state that ``violation means noncompliance with the termsof a suspension agreement caused by an act or omission of a signatory exporter,except, at the discretion of the Secretary, an act or omission which isinadvertent or inconsequential.'' Even if the Department finds that theact or omission was clearly inadvertent or inconsequential and decidesnot to declare the agreement violated, the Department would consider whetherit is appropriate to seek revision of the agreement under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B)or (b)(2)(ii)(C) in order to eliminate the possibility of repetition ofsuch acts or omissions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.20(a)</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> One party states that the regulations should providethat the Department will make a final determination not later than 75 daysafter ``the date of'' its preliminary determination (as under the currentregulation) rather than ``the date of publication of'' its preliminarydetermination (as proposed). The party notes that the preliminary determinationmay be signed three to five days before it is published in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4> which means that under the proposed rule theDepartment may extend the statutory time limit by the same number of days.Another party suggests that paragraph (a)(2)(i) should be modified to requireinclusion of administrative and judicial precedents on which the legalconclusions are based. In addition, this party urges that paragraph (a)be modified to clarify that subsequent determinations cannot expand thescope of the investigation established in the notice of initiation.One party suggests that the regulations require the Department to holddisclosure conferences with the parties, if requested, after the finaldetermination but before the antidumping duty order is published. At suchconferences, the Department should provide a full explanation of the finaldetermination, including disclosure of all calculations and computer materialsused in that determination. This party also suggests that the regulationsprovide for the correction of any errors in the calculation of a dumpingmargin no later than 20 days after publication of an order. This wouldavoid unnecessary litigation as a result of the requirement that partiesfile a summons with the U.S. Court of International Trade 30 days afterpublication of an order to preserve their rights to seek court orders mandatingcorrections.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We have revised paragraph (a) to statethat ``[n]ot later than 75 days after the date of the Secretary's preliminarydetermination, the Secretary will make a final determination * * *.''Regarding paragraph (a)(2)(i), it is the Department's practice to explainin detail the legal conclusions for its final determinations, including,as appropriate, a statement of relevant legal precedent. This practicefully complies with section 735(d) of the Act. Regarding the comment onexpansion of the scope of the investigation, see the Department's responseto comments on andSection; 353.13.We have added a new paragraph (e) that would require the Department tohold a disclosure conference, if requested, after a final determination.This paragraph reflects the Department's current practice. We note thatthe purpose of any disclosure conference is only to provide an explanationof the calculation methodology used in a determination. <T3>See </T3>the Department's response to comments on andSection; 353.15(g).Section 1333 of the 1988 Act requires correction of ministerial errorsfollowing a final determination. <T3>See </T3>the Department's interim procedures at 53 FR 41617 (October24, 1988); 53 FR 5813 (February 26, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.20(b)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>In order to conform with the statute, we have revised paragraph(b) to provide that the Secretary will postpone the final determinationto not later than 135 days after the date of <T3>publication of</T3> the preliminary determination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, we have added to paragraph (b) the requirement that theSecretary notify all parties to the proceeding and publish notice of anypostponement.

Two parties note that it often is unclear even to an informedobserver whether a particular sale is at less than fair value, and thusit is manifestly unfair to penalize foreign producers for believing thattheir practices for determining fair value are the same as the Department'spractices. These parties also argue that this section is unnecessary becausethe regulations already require publication of the dumping margins foreach respondent, thus there is no reason to make special mention of companiesthat unsuccessfully sought exclusion because there is no difference inthe legal result. They suggest eliminating this proposed section.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>There is no ``penalty'' associated withstating a company's dumping margin. The paragraph is not needed, however,because the requirement to publish the margins for all producers and resellersfound to have been selling at less than fair value is already providedby andSection; 353.20(a)(2)(ii). We, therefore, have deleted the paragraphand renumbered the succeeding paragraphs accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.21</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party contends that the scope of an antidumping ordermust be limited to the product coverage set forth in the notice of initiation.<T3>Department's Position: See </T3>the Department's response to commentson andSection; 353.13.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.21(c)</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party argues that the clause ``no weighted-averagedumping margin'' should be replaced by a <T3>de minimis </T3>standard, which would make the regulation consistentwith the Department's current practice.This party also contends that, in order to be excluded from an order, afirm must have either (a) applied for and qualified for an exclusion underandSection; 353.14, or (b) been a producer or seller investigated by theSecretary and found to have no weighted-average dumping margin during theinvestigative period. This party notes that the use of the term ``and''in the proposed regulation can be read to require that both conditionsbe present.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The phrase ``no weighted-average dumpingmargin'' means any zero margin. A <T3>de minimis </T3>margin is considered a zero margin. Any party for whichthere was no weighted-average dumping margin (including <T3>de minimis</T3>) would be excluded from the Department's order. Thedefinition of <T3>de minimis </T3>was addressed in the rulemaking which culminated inpublication of a final rule on <T3>de minimis</T3> dumping margins and countervailable subsidies at 52FR 30660 (August 17, 1987). That rule is included in these regulationsas andSection; 353.6.Paragraph (c), as proposed, only addressed exclusions based on requestssubmitted under andSection; 353.14. We have modified this paragraph to clarifythat any producer or reseller that did not request exclusion under andSection;353.14 and for which the Department nonetheless calculated a zero marginwill be excluded from the order. <T3>See </T3>Department's response to comments on andSection; 353.14.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.22(a)</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> Three parties argue that the proposed regulation willresult in interested parties having to request a new administrative reviewbefore the final determination has been made in an ongoing review. Oneparty argues that, as proposed, the regulation will reimpose on the Departmentthe burden of conducting reviews that no party desires. This party suggeststhat this section be revised to provide that the Department will make afinal determination within 12 months of the anniversary date of publicationof the order or suspension agreement, instead of from the month in whichthe review was requested. One party suggests that this section be revisedto allow requests for a subsequent review to take place only after theprevious review has been completed. Another party suggests either shorteningthe time period for the administrative review or extending the deadlinefor the request of subsequent reviews.Two parties recommend that the regulations require the Department to continueits present practice of publishing each month in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> a list of orders that have anniversaries occurringduring the month. One party urges that the notices should include the ratesof duty that will be automatically assessed if no request for review isreceived, and that the notices be mailed to all interested parties to thepreceding investigation or review.One party urges the Department to include a provision that would allowforeign producers that are new entrants into the U.S. market after theinvestigation is completed to have the opportunity to request a reviewat any time more than six months after the deadline for exclusion requestsin the last segment of the proceeding. lf it is determined that a new entrantmade no sales at less than foreign market value, the order should be revoked<T3>ab initio</T3> with regard to the products of that party. In addition,if the Department does not act on a timely request for exclusion duringan investigation, any firm that made such a request should be entitledto an expedited review and, if appropriate, revocation or an individualestimated duty rate.<T3> Department's Position:</T3> Regarding the timetable for requestingand conducting reviews, we find that proposed andSection; 353.22 does notcomply with the statutory direction that a review be conducted ``at leastonce during each 12-month period beginning on the anniversary of the dateof publication of the order * * *.'' We have, therefore, amended paragraph(c)(7) to require that the review be completed not later than 365 daysafter the <T3>anniversary</T3> month (replacing ``Secretary's initiation of''). Consequently,reviews will be completed by the end of the anniversary month. In orderto ensure that the Department can meet the new deadlines for completingreviews during the period of transition to the new final rule, we haveprovided that the effective date of paragraphs 353.22 (a) and (c) willbe the first day of the first month beginning 60 days after publicationof these rules. Prior to that date, the interim final rule published onAugust 13, 1985 (50 FR 32556) will apply.<T3> See also</T3> the Department's response to comments on paragraph (c)(7).We recognize the importance to the party submitting the request for reviewof knowing the final results of the immediately preceding review, if any.Therefore, we are modifying paragraph (a) to permit the party that submitsa request to withdraw the request under certain conditions. If a relevantreview has not been completed before the end of the anniversary month duringwhich the new request is submitted, the party that submitted the new requestmay withdraw it not later than 90 days after the date of publication ofnotice of initiation of the requested review. The Secretary may extendthe time limit if it is reasonable to do so. Notice of the terminationor partial termination of an administrative review, based on withdrawalof the request, will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. (Notice of partial termination normally willbe published together with the preliminary results of administrative reviewfor other firms being reviewed, if any). As a matter of practice, the Department does publish in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> at the beginning of each month a courtesy listingof reviews that can be requested during the month. It is the responsibility,however, of interested parties to follow developments in a proceeding evenin the absence of published notice at the beginning of the anniversarymonth. It is unnecessary for the Department to list various estimated antidumpingduty rates in the published notice, especially because our experience hasbeen that many parties discuss their options with the Department priorto filing a request for review.We find unacceptable the suggestion that new entrants into the U.S. marketafter publication of an antidumping duty order be provided an opportunityfor expedited review and, if our first examination of those exporters indicatesthat there were no sales at less than foreign market value, for the orderto be revoked with regard to their products. Antidumping duty orders applyto all imports from a covered country, except those from firms specificallyexcluded from the antidumping duty order. Exclusions are based on the examinationof a period prior to initiation of the investigation, when the respondentfirm presumably acted without regard to the potential imposition of dutiesunder the U.S. antidumping duty law. Under these circumstances, the Departmentcan predict with some reliability the firm's future actions. If we wereto follow the proposal in the comment, it would be simple for a firm, knowingof the antidumping duty order, to enter the market, ship for one year orless without selling at less than foreign market value, be ``excluded,''and then begin to sell at less than foreign market value. We believe therevocation procedures of andSection; 353.25 provide the additional measureof security necessary before revocation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.22(c)</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>Regarding the procedures set forth in paragraph (c),one party contends that the Department should be required to provide individualnotice of initiation of a review to all parties to the original investigationor most recent review. If the Department initiates a review of an individualproducer or reseller under paragraph (a) by publication of a notice underparagraph (c)(1), the Department should give other producers and resellers30 days from the date of publication of the notice to inform the Departmentthat they also want a review.Another party argues that it is unconstitutional to send questionnairesto and verify only a sample of respondents. They argue that paragraph (c)(2)should be revised to provide that questionnaires will be sent to and verificationwill be conducted for every respondent that timely requests either.One party believes the 365-day time limit in paragraph (c)(7) for issuingthe final results of administrative review should be shortened to six months,with the possibility of extension to nine months for reviews under paragraph(a)(1) that involve a large number of respondents. This party states thatthe Department should expedite reviews in order to reduce uncertaintiescaused by long periods of suspension of liquidation.Finally, one party argues that the proposed regulations provide no formalmechanism for participation by interested parties. It suggests that theregulation be amended to allow interested parties to comment on the questionnairesbefore they are distributed, on the verification procedures, and beforeany hearing is held, on the Department's verification report.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We do not agree that all parties to thesegment of a proceeding immediately preceding the initiated review mustreceive actual notice of the initiation under andSection; 353.22(c)(1). Asa matter of practice, however, we have attempted, and will continue toattempt, to provide actual notice to the parties. As to the suggestionthat, following initiation of an individual producer or reseller reviewunder paragraph (a), the Department provide a second period for requestingreviews, the party submitting the comment provided no reason, and we cansee no reason, to do so. All interested parties have an opportunity torequest a review during the anniversary month. A decision to request areview is completely independent of any other party's request for reviewof an individual producer or reseller.With regard to the argument concerning the unconstitutionality of the provisionthat allows the Department to send questionnaires to and verify only asample of respondents, this authority is established in andSection; 777Aof the Act. The Conference Report of the 1984 Act specifically describedthe provision as expanding ``the instances in which the administering authoritymay use sampling and averaging techniques * * * in carrying out annualreviews of outstanding AD or CUD [sic] orders under section 751 * * *.''H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1156, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 186 (1984).Regarding the suggestion that the Department shorten the time limit inparagraph (c)(7) to six or nine months, the Department requires no lessthan 365 days in many cases to complete an administrative review. Any shortertime limit is impracticable.Participation by interested parties is provided by Subpart C. As a matterof practice, the Department makes every attempt to consult with partiesto the proceeding.We note that, to be consistent with changes made in the countervailingduty regulations, we have extended the deadline in paragraph (c) for publicationof notices of initiation of administrative reviews from 10 days to 15 daysafter the anniversary month. This change has been made to reflect the amountof time that is actually needed to publish an initiation notice. This revisiondoes not change the Department's deadline for completing reviews.We also note that in paragraph (c) of this section, we have clarified thatthe Department will hold a disclosure conference, if requested, promptlyafter issuing the final results in an administrative review. In addition,we have clarified that the purpose of disclosure, whether after the preliminaryresults or after the final results, is only to provide an explanation ofthe calculation methodology used in reaching the results.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.22(e)</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> All parties commenting on this provision urge that thisparagraph be amended to require assessment at the most recently determinedrate. These parties argue that in situations in which administrative reviewshave been completed after the final determination, the cash deposit ratefor the entries may not reflect the most recently determined antidumpingduty rate. In addition, they note that when the duty rate established ina final determination is lower than the preliminary rate, automatic assessmentshould be made on the basis of the final rate. One party recommends anamendment to this section, proposing that when the Customs Service assessesantidumping duties in that situation, the section should specify an exception``with respect to merchandise entered between the preliminary affirmativedetermination by the Secretary and the final affirmative determinationby the ITC of material injury, in which case such entries shall be assessedantidumping duties at the lower of the preliminary or the final rate asis appropriate.''Two parties argue that this proposed regulation is contrary to the GATT.According to these parties, the Antidumping Code unambiguously providesthat the rate set in the final antidumping duty order for all purposesreplaces rates determined at an earlier stage of an antidumping investigation.Thus, the collection of duties at the rate established in a preliminarydetermination is contrary to the Antidumping Code, especially in thosecases where the final rate is lower than the preliminary one.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Because the cash deposit (or bond) rateis the basis for each interested party's decision whether to exercise itsright to request a review, it would make no sense to change the rate afterthe time for request has expired. Interested parties that believe the assessmentlevel should be higher or lower than the estimated antidumping duties depositedat the time of entry can request an administrative review. In addition,the use of the cash deposit rate required at the time of entry is in accordancewith the purpose of the entire review-upon-request mechanism,<T3> i.e., </T3>to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens. If theserecommendations were adopted, the Customs Service would be required tomake adjustments for under- or overcollections as well as collecting, orpaying, interest. In any event, the failure of an interested party to filea timely request for review constitutes a determination under section 751of the dumping margin for the entries made during the review period.We disagree with the argument that paragraph (e) is inconsistent with theAntidumping Code. A final determination in an investigation only establishesan estimated weighted-average dumping margin. The amount of the dumpingmargin does not become ``fixed'' within the meaning of Article 11 of theAntidumping Code, and thus antidumping duties are not assessed, until theDepartment has completed an administrative review. At that time, dutieswould be assessed at the rate established in the final results of administrativereview. If an administrative review results in the ``fixing'' of a lowerrate than had been deposited, the difference would be refunded in accordanceboth with U.S. law and the GATT Antidumping Code. If no review of particularentries is requested, however, the cash deposit rate becomes the ``fixed''rate, and the entries will be liquidated at that rate. As noted above,interested parties that believe the assessment level should be higher orlower than the estimated duties deposited at the time of entry can requestan administrative review. <T3>See</T3> the Department's response to comments on andSection; 353.23.We emphasize that when no interested party requests an administrative review,the Department will instruct Customs to liquidate the entries for thatreview period at the rate deposited at the time of entry. This automaticassessment will occur regardless of whether litigation regarding a prioradministrative review or the LTFV investigation is pending.<T3> See NTN Bearing Corp. of America</T3> v.<T3> United States,</T3> Slip Op. 88-161, 12 CIT <T2>XXX</T2> (November 23, 1988) (citing <T3>Fundicao Tupy S.A.</T3> v.<T3> United States,</T3> Slip Op. 87-93, 11 CIT <T2>XXX</T2> (August 3, 1987)).<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.22(f)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>To be consistent with changes made to the countervailingduty regulations, we have modified paragraph (f)(1)(vii) (proposed paragraph(f)(1)(vi)) by deleting the phrase ``If appropriate.''

Section 737(a)states that the ``cap'' on assessment of duties on entries made duringthe period between the Department's preliminary determination under section733(d)(2) and the Commission's final determination under section 735(b)is the cash deposit rate set by the Department in its preliminary determinationunder section 733(d)(2) of the Act. Section 737(a) does not authorize theDepartment to establish a new cap at the time it issues its final determinationunder section 735(a) of the Act, as this section of the regulation woulddo. According to the commenter, in <T3>Fireplace Mesh Panels from Taiwan</T3>, 48 FR 31279 (1983), the Departmentconcluded that the estimated rate announced at a preliminary affirmativeLTFV determination established a maximum rate on the duties that couldbe collected on entries prior to the Commission's final injury determination.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Section 353.23 is consistent with section737(a) of the Act and the Department's practice. Section 737(a) of theAct provides that the ``cap'' on the assessment of duties on an entry madeprior to the date of the Commission's final affirmative determination isthe amount of the cash deposit or bond required as security for that entry.For an entry made between the Department's preliminary and final determinations,the cash deposit or bond is set by the Department's preliminary determination.For an entry made after the final determination, the cash deposit or bondis set by the Department's final determination. Nothing in section 737precludes the Department from changing the amount required as security(the bond or deposit rate) when it issues its final affirmative determination.In fact, if the rate in the final determination is higher than the ratein the preliminary determination, it is necessary to order the larger security,in order to assure that the duty can be collected at the appropriate time.With one aberration, the Department has consistently followed the practicereflected in andSection; 353.23. <T3>See, e.g., Forged Undercarriage Components from Italy</T3>, 48 FR 52111,52116 (1983). <T3>Fireplace Mesh Panels,</T3> a 1983 decision, is inconsistent with thisrule and will not be followed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.25(a) and (b)</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> Four parties object to the three-year time period forrevocation or termination based on the absence of sales at less than foreignmarket value. These parties suggest keeping the current two-year periodbecause they believe the Department's current practice has worked well.Two parties note that the proposed change will unnecessarily increase theburden on the Department for conducting section 751 reviews. One partysuggests that if the proposed three-year time period is adopted, the Departmentshould permit the request for a review to be submitted on the second anniversaryof the order because the revocation will not take effect for another year.Another party urges the Department not to apply retroactively the new time-periodto cases in which revocation proceedings have been initiated under theexisting regulations. Another party suggests that the regulation clarifythat, for purposes of revocation, a finding of <T3>de minimis</T3> dumping margins is equivalent to a finding of no salesat less than foreign market value. Three parties urge the Department to modify the proposed regulation toprovide for revocations based on the absence of shipments. One party arguesthat the absence of such a provision will result in new shippers beingindefinitely ``locked-out'' of the U.S. market.One party requests the Department to delete the requirement in paragraphs(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(2)(ii) that the Department determine that a foreignproducer is ``not likely'' to sell merchandise at less than foreign marketvalue. The party argues that the Department has included no guidelinesas to how this provision would be implemented and as to how the Departmentwould determine whether future sales below foreign market value were ``likely''or not. Regarding the reinstatement provision in paragraph (a)(2)(iii),this party argues that a revocation based on the absence of LTFV salesshould be final. The party adds, however, that if any ``probationary''period is necessary, it should be limited to a one-year period followingthe period of no margins.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The adoption of a three-year period forrevocation or termination based on the absence of dumping does not substantiallymodify the period of time that must be examined under the current regulations.Even though the current regulations require a two-year period without dumping,the practice adopted in antidumping proceedings requires the examinationof, at a minimum, about two years and nine months. That is because theDepartment examines the period between the end of the two-year period andthe date of the tentative revocation or termination (the ``gap period'').The adoption in andSection; 353.25(c)(3) of the day after the end of thethree-year period as the effective revocation date eliminates the needfor an examination of the gap period. Regarding the suggestion that requests for revocation be entertained atthe second anniversary of the order, this is simply impossible. The rulerequires no dumped sales for a three-year period. A request, therefore,cannot be considered until there is a three-year period for the Departmentto examine, which cannot occur until after the end of the second anniversarymonth.<T3>In cases in which the Department has issued tentative revocations priorto the effective date of these regulations, it will complete the revocationprocedure under the existing regulations. In all other cases, the new regulationswill apply.</T3> With regard to the suggestion that the regulation clarify the effect ofa finding of <T3>de minimis</T3> dumping margins, a<T3> de minimis</T3> margin obviously is equivalent to a zero margin andthus no clarification is necessary. For an explanation of the consequencesof a finding of <T3>de minimis</T3> dumping margins, see the Department's response to commentson andSection; 353.21(c). In a departure from the Department's past practice, this rule does notprovide for revocations based on a period of no shipments. It has beenthe Department's experience that the absence of shipments is no indicationof the absence of price discrimination, which is the basis for revocationunder this paragraph. In determining, however, whether an order shouldbe revoked based on changed circumstances under paragraph (d), the Departmentmay consider among other things periods of no shipments.The statute gives the Secretary broad discretion in deciding when to revokean order. The Secretary has determined that a pre-condition to revocationunder this paragraph is that the Secretary be satisfied that there is nolikelihood of future sales at less than foreign market value. Finally,with regard to the reinstatement provision in paragraph (a)(2)(iii), thecommenter has not indicated that any burden is imposed on a respondentthat has entered into a reinstatement agreement and as to which an orderhas been revoked. By comparison, without this provision, petitioners wouldface the unnecessary time and expense associated with a new proceedingif dumping activity resumes. We note that we have deleted the referenceto ``fair value'' in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) because the correct term afteran order is in place is ``foreign market value.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.25(d)(4)</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> Regarding the ``sunset'' provision in paragraph (d)(4),two parties argue that the language unnecessarily limits application ofthe provision to cases in which ``no interested party requested an administrativereview'' during the preceding four years. They note that this should notapply to cases in which producers or resellers that have eliminated orlowered a dumping margin have requested a review. The fact that an importer,producer, or reseller may have requested an administrative review duringthe four-year period in order to lower deposit rates should not be heldagainst them. The issue is whether a domestic interested party is interestedenough to pursue the review. Therefore, these parties suggest precludinga revocation only in those cases in which a review was requested on behalfof the domestic industry.In addition, two parties oppose the proposal that the mere objection byany interested party should be sufficient to prevent revocation of an order.One party suggests that a revocation be suspended only if an interestedparty shows that revocation may lead to injury or threat of injury. Theother party suggests that the objecting party be required to show goodcause why the revocation should not be issued.Two parties note that the time limits provided are unnecessarily long.One party suggests that the procedure described in this subsection be initiated90 days before the third anniversary month, and concluded by publicationof the revocation if no objection is received by the last day of that month.Finally, one party argues that the provision requiring the Department toprovide written notice to each party on the service list and to ``any otherperson which the Secretary has reason to believe produces or sells thelike product in the United States'' is absurd and should be eliminated.It contends that the Department is inviting an administrative nightmare,and that publication in the<T4> Federal Register </T4> is sufficient. It notes that although the Departmentprofesses to want to reduce its litigation caseload, it is inviting companieswhich may never have been parties to sue the Department over whether itshould have known they would be interested in the subject.<T3> Department's Position:</T3> Congress has recognized that the Departmentmay revoke an order or terminate a suspended investigation in the absenceof domestic party interest in continuing the order or suspended investigation.<T3> See</T3> H.R. Rep. No. 1156, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 181 (1984). Theso-called ``sunset'' provision is merely a means for ascertaining if interestin continuation of the order exists. Thus, we limit application of thisprovision to proceedings in which no party has requested a review duringthe preceding four years. Importers, producers, or resellers that believeno domestic interested party is interested in continuation of the ordermay request revocation under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.The ``sunset'' provision of paragraph (d)(4) is not intended to substitutefor other provisions of the Act or regulations that govern particular situationswarranting revocation. For example, a changed circumstances request tothe Commission under section 751(b) of the Act is the proper vehicle forreview of whether injury continues to exist. The changed circumstancesprovision in paragraph (d)(1) (and other provisions) is a more appropriatebasis for revocation of an order in contested cases. If parties believethat five years is too long to wait for a revocation in accordance withthe provisions of paragraph (d)(4), they may request revocation under theother provisions of andSection; 353.25.As stated earlier, because the ``sunset'' provision is a means for ascertainingwhether there is interest in continuation of an order, it is appropriatethat the Department take reasonable steps, including giving actual noticeof the intent to revoke or terminate, to determine whether such interestexists. We believe the courts will take account of the Department's limitedknowledge of the existence of U.S. producers or sellers other than thosefound on the service list which may be interested in a proposed revocationor termination.We note that because a notice of initiation and consideration of revocationor termination provided for in paragraph (d)(3)(i) need not be based ona request, we have added a new paragraph (d)(3)(ii) requiring actual noticeif the consideration is not based on a request.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.25(e)</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party suggests that the proposed regulation be modifiedto clarify application of the phrase ``negative final result'' to suspensionagreements due to confusion that may be caused by the related Commissionregulation. Because section 751(b) of the Act and the Commission regulationprovides that it shall determine whether an agreement continues to eliminatecompletely the injurious effect of imports, a ``negative final result''would require an order to be restored, not revoked. The party, therefore,suggests that the Department's regulation be modified to prevent any futureconfusion.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree that clarification is needed asto a finding by the Commission concerning a suspension agreement, whichwould result in termination of a suspended investigation, and have modifiedthe final rule accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.31(a)</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>Five parties believe that the deadlines for submissionof factual information are unreasonably short and inflexible. Most of theseparties object to the proposed deadlines because they would preclude submissionof factual information during verification, even though such informationcould be verified, or after verification, even though such informationmay rebut, clarify, or correct earlier submissions.One party suggests that for both investigations and administrative reviews,the Department establish a deadline of 10 days subsequent to verificationor 30 days prior to a final determination or final results of review forsubmission of factual information. One party favors retention of the morediscretionary guidelines in andSection; 353.46 of the current regulations,which permit the Department to issue specific instructions regarding specificsubmissions and extend the deadline for submission when warranted. Twoparties urge retention of the flexibility afforded by the current regulationto extend established deadlines, whatever deadlines are included in thenew regulations. One party urges the Department to retain the discretionto accept late submissions ``when justice requires,'' and suggests revisionof the proposed regulation to permit consideration of factual informationsubmitted after the deadline in such instances. One party suggests thatthe regulations be revised to permit the Department to accept at any timeinformation that corrects or clarifies earlier submissions, as under currentpractice.One party focuses specifically on the effect of the deadlines on the abilityof petitioners to participate fully in proceedings. It emphasizes thatthe deadlines in paragraph (a) are appropriate for respondents but wouldmake it impossible for petitioners to organize and to focus their investigativeefforts on particular issues raised in respondents' submissions, becauserespondents' submissions are often made just prior to the deadline establishedin this paragraph. This party suggests that the time limits in paragraph(a) should apply only to respondents, and that the Department permit petitionersto submit factual information not less than 30 days after all proprietaryinformation submitted by respondents and the non-public version of theDepartment's verification report have been released to petitioners underadministrative protective order. Alternatively, this party believes theDepartment should establish specific deadlines in each case, as under currentpractice.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The purpose of this section is to provideall interested parties a reasonable opportunity to submit factual informationfor the Department to consider in the final determination or final resultsof review. The ``flexible'' approach to deadlines for submission of factualinformation, which means that the Department establishes time limits separatelyfor each investigation or review, has led to seemingly endless confusionand time-consuming debate about what is a reasonable time limit.The comments have not persuaded us that the time limits for submissionof factual information by respondents (interested parties as defined inparagraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of andSection; 353.2) are unfair or unreasonable.If the Department deems additional factual information to be critical tothe investigation or review, the Department will request the informationunder andSection; 353.31(b)(1). Such information might include informationthat to some extent clarifies or corrects earlier timely submissions andthat could be, for example, requested orally at verification.We do agree, however, that the proposed rule does not provide domesticinterested parties (interested parties as defined in paragraph (k)(3),(k)(4), (k)(5), or (k)(6) of andSection; 353.2) an adequate opportunity torebut, clarify, or correct earlier submissions of factual information byrespondents. Accordingly, we have modified paragraph (a) of this sectionto provide a period of 10 days from the date such factual information isavailable to domestic interested parties for the submission of factualinformation that clarifies, rebuts, or corrects earlier submissions byrespondents. The information is ``available'' to a domestic interestedparty when it is either served on it or, if the information is businessproprietary information that is not served directly on the domestic interestedparty, released to it under APO.We note that the deadlines for submission of questionnaire responses, includingdeficiency responses, and submissions of new allegations by petitionersare controlled by paragraphs (b) and (c).We also note that we have clarified that factual information submittedafter the applicable deadline will be returned to the submitter with writtennotice stating the reason for return of the information.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.31(b)</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>Three parties believe that the proposed limitation inparagraph (b)(2) on consideration or retention in the record of unsolicitedquestionnaire responses should be deleted. One party argues that the antidumpinglaw provides no authority for the Department to reject voluntary submissions.Another party comments that the Department's failure to include submissions,solicited or not, in the record is contrary to the Department's administrativeresponsibilities and could deprive a party of its right to judicial review.Three parties argue that this paragraph unnecessarily restricts the officialswho have the authority to approve requests for extension of time. One partysuggests that the appropriate officials should be authorized to delegateauthority to other Department employees to approve requests for extensions.Another party recommends that this provision be amended to provide a ``safetyvalve'' for unforeseen contingencies when a written request has becomeimpossible or the appropriate officials are unavailable.One party argues that the proposal in paragraph (b)(4) to shorten the timefor submission of questionnaire responses is unjustified. It notes thatit is virtually impossible to gather the required information and translateit in the time period allowed. In addition, it contends that the Departmentoften does not review responses until several weeks after they are submitted,and that it therefore is inappropriate to require respondents to meet unrealisticdeadlines. If the Department is going to insist on perfect responses bynot allowing opportunities for revisions of unintentional errors, it mustallow sufficient time for the preparation of such responses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>As explained in the preamble to the proposedrule, the short statutory time limits and the complexity of antidumpingduty proceedings, including verification requirements, usually make itimpossible for the Department to consider unsolicited questionnaire responses.<T3>See </T3>51 FR 29052 (August 13, 1986). The Department normally includesin its investigation foreign producers and resellers accounting for mostof the exports of the merchandise. In addition, a party may request exclusionfrom an investigation under andSection; 353.14 or revocation under andSection;353.25(b), as appropriate. In unusual circumstances, paragraph (b)(2) permitsthe Department to consider unsolicited questionnaire responses. We notethat we have added a sentence to paragraph (b)(2) to clarify that untimelyor unsolicited questionnaire responses rejected by the Department willbe returned to the submitter with written notice specifying the reasonswhy the Department rejected the information.Requests for extension must be approved in writing, as provided in paragraph(b)(3), in order to avoid confusion and ensure fair and equitable treatmentfor all parties. If the designated official is not available to act ona request, the official will have designated someone else to act in theofficial's absence. The first sentence of paragraph (b)(3) emphasizes thefact that an extension of time for submitting a questionnaire responseis difficult to obtain. The Department will judge each request on its ownmerits and grant requests when the requester can establish a legitimateneed for additional time.The party that believes the Department is shortening the time limit forsubmission of questionnaire responses is incorrect. Previously, the Departmentgenerally required questionnaire responses in administrative reviews tobe submitted 30 days after receipt of the questionnaire, with an easilygranted 15-day extension. The new regulatory deadline in this paragraphprovides for a net gain of at least 15 days.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.31(c)</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party comments that the deadline in paragraph (c)(2)for submission of an allegation that a petitioner lacks standing is entirelytoo late in an investigation. They argue that the proposed deadline wouldmake it difficult for the petitioner to offer factual or legal argumentsby way of rebuttal in time for the Department to give them due considerationbefore making a preliminary determination. Alternatively, the proposedfiling deadline could mean that no decision would be made until after thepreliminary determination; if the Department's preliminary determinationwere affirmative, however, dismissal of the investigation would violatesection 732(a) of the Act. This party recommends revising the proposedregulation by limiting such an allegation to ``not later than 45 days afterthe filing of the petition.'' Petitioners should then have 10 days afterreceipt of the allegation to respond.Another party argues that there should be no time limits placed on allegationsthat a petitioner lacks standing. They contend that because standing isa prerequisite for imposition of antidumping duties, as a matter of law,a party should be able to raise it at any time during the course of a proceeding.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The time limit on allegations of petitioner'slack of standing is intended to ensure that the allegation is submittedsufficiently early in the proceeding to permit adequate investigation ofthe allegation. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, ``[s]tandingis important; however, it is also complex and the Department needs timeto gather and evaluate the facts.'' 51 FR 29052 (August 13, 1986). TheDepartment believes the time limit is reasonable based on its experiencein dealing with such allegations. <T3>See, e.g., Certain Atlantic Groundfish from Canada, </T3>51 FR 10041,10043 (1986).We note that we have revised paragraph (c)(1)(ii) to provide an exceptionto the deadline for filing allegations of sales below the cost of productionwhen the Department determines that a ``relevant response'' is untimelyor incomplete. The added language mirrors the language already includedin paragraph (c)(1)(i).Submitters should note that the adequacy of new allegations will be judgedby the same standard (taking into account the information reasonably availableat the time) as would have applied if the allegations had been containedin the petition. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.31(e) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party states that the Department should not rejecta submission that substantially conforms to the requirements stated inparagraphs (e) (1) and (2), and that the regulation should provide an automaticright for a party to resubmit a document in acceptable form when the initialsubmission was unsatisfactory solely because it failed to comply with therequirements set forth in these paragraphs. Regarding paragraph (e)(3),this party would add a statement that, absent clear evidence to the contrary,the Department will accept a submitter's representation that it would beunable to submit a computer tape without unreasonable additional burdenin time and expense. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>Although paragraph (e)(1) gives the Departmentthe authority in specific situations to alter the requirements in paragraph(e), the Department believes it is important that submissions conform tothe stated requirements. The Department must be able to process documentsquickly so that deadlines can be met. Proprietary information must be identifiablequickly and, if subject to administrative protective order, should be somarked. From the standpoint of an individual submitter of information,these filing requirements and deadlines may seem trivial. From the standpointof the Department, however, they are very important to the efficient andtimely administration of the program. If each of the hundreds of submittersof information were free to depart from the filing requirements, the cumulativeburden on the Department would be enormous, and would defeat the very purposefor having filing requirements and deadlines. Therefore, the Departmentcannot accept ``substantial compliance'' as a norm. By spelling out indetail each filing requirement, the Department has made it easy for interestedparties to understand how to file documents timely and in the proper form.The Department does not anticipate a need to create exceptions to the straightforwardfiling requirements. Regarding the exception to the filing requirement in paragraph (e)(3),the Department will consider the ``burden in time and expense'' withoutnecessarily requiring that both be demonstrated in each case. In evaluatingsuch claims, the Department will draw on its knowledge of the submitterand on its own expertise in computer operations. Although the Departmentis likely to accept the submitter's description of the additional burdenit would incur, the Department will decide whether such burden is unreasonable.The Department will require computer tapes to be submitted in an investigationor administrative review only if the Department believes that computertapes are necessary and appropriate in the particular segment of the proceedingin question. We note that we have modified paragraph (e)(3) to clarify that the Secretarymay require submissions on computer tape as long as that requirement isnot an ``unreasonable additional burden.'' We also note that, to be consistent with changes made to the countervailingduty regulations, and to improve the speed and efficiency of document handling,the Department is revising paragraph (e): (1) to increase from five toseven the number of copies of a document required in an administrativereview; (2) to specify that documents shall be single-sided; (3) to requirea statement that the document may or may not be released under administrativeprotective order; and (4) to require that each computer tape be accompaniedby a printout of the tape.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.31(f)-(i)</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> In order to avoid unnecessary expense, one party wouldhave the Department require the submitter to provide an English translationfor any submitted document, or designated portion thereof, within fivedays of a request from the Department. Another party suggests that we modifythe regulation to provide that documents should be accompanied by Englishtranslations and failure to provide such translation may result in rejectionof the document. This approach would eliminate the burden on the Departmentto waive in writing the translation requirement.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We believe paragraph (f) as drafted properlybalances the needs of the Department for an English translation of a documentagainst the desire of the submitter to meet deadlines and avoid unnecessaryadministrative burdens.We note that we have modified paragraph (g) to make exceptions to the servicerequirement for petitions, proposed suspension agreements, and factualinformation submitted under andSection; 353.32(a) that is not required tobe served on an interested party.<T3> See</T3> the Department's response to comments on andSection; 353.18(g)(1).We note that we have added as paragraph (i) to the final rule a certificationrequirement for submissions of factual information.<T3> See</T3> the Department's response to comments on andSection; 353.12(a).We believe that the certification requirement will help to ensure the completenessand accuracy of factual submissions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.32(a)</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> One party comments that the requirement in paragraph(a)(2) for an explanation why each piece of factual information is entitledto proprietary treatment is unnecessary and would be extremely expensivein light of the fact that antidumping questionnaire responses often areover 100 pages in length. Another party suggests that documents such ascontracts and internal financial statements that are submitted in supportof questionnaire responses should be excluded from release under an APO,irrespective of whether the submitter has identified such documents. <T3>Department's Position:</T3> For information that falls within andSection;353.4(b), the Department will require only that the submitter specify howthe information fits within andSection; 353.4(b).The standard for deciding whether to release particular information, includingthe information noted by the commenter, under administrative protectiveorder, is provided in andSection; 353.34(a).<T3> See</T3> 51 FR 29053 (August 13, 1986).We note that we have modified paragraph (a)(2) of this section to clarifythat submitters must mark ``Proprietary Treatment Requested'' only on pagesthat contain proprietary information.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.32(b)</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> Six parties suggest modifications that would make thesummarization requirements in paragraph (b) less burdensome to the submitter.Four parties argue that when information is released under an APO, a submittershould not be required to ``range'' figures in a submission or to providea detailed public summary. Three of these parties add that the statutedoes not require public summaries of confidential data to include rangesof the numbers submitted. Two parties suggested that the Department deletethe reference to ranging within 10 percent of the actual figure becausethe ranging may not sufficiently mask the proprietary information (especiallywhen the actual figure is small). One party suggests that only individualrepresentative transactions be summarized within the 10 percent range.Another party suggests a range within 20 percent of the actual figure.With regard to voluminous data, one party suggests that the submitter bepermitted to summarize a representative sample. Two of the six partieswould modify the regulation to require a detailed nonproprietary summaryonly when domestic interested parties have established a particular needfor such a detailed summary; otherwise, a brief public summary should besufficient. If the Department retains the proposed rule without modifyingit, one party urges the Department to allow the submitter a period of 10days after submission of the proprietary information in which to file thenonproprietary summary.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> As amended by the 1984 Act, section 777(b)(1)of the Act requires either a ``non-proprietary summary in sufficient detailto permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the informationsubmitted in confidence'' or a statement explaining why such a summaryis not feasible. As we explained in the preamble to the proposed rule,the ``brief'' nonproprietary summary permitted by the current rule is notconsistent with the Act as amended. 51 FR 29053 (August 13, 1986).To some extent, what is ``sufficient detail'' and what is ``feasible''depend on the facts of each case, including the identity of the parties,the number of items of information, and whether or not the submitter hascomputer capability. The general requirement that numeric data be groupedwithin 10 percent of the actual figure is intended to alert parties toan approach that our experience shows has been adequate in many situationsto meet the statutory purpose. The regulation recognizes what the conflictingcomments make clear_that<T3> ad hoc</T3> decisions as to particular data may be necessary. Someof the suggestions are excellent ways to deal with particular submissions,and the Department will take account of these approaches in specific cases.The fact that the data submitted are voluminous does not by itself excusethe submitter from the burden of providing a public summary that wouldafford parties not entitled to receive the proprietary data an opportunityfor ``a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information submittedin confidence.'' We note that we have clarified that if a portion of asubmission is voluminous, the numeric data summarized must be <T3>representative</T3> of that portion.To extend the deadline for submission of the nonproprietary summary ofinformation would delay the availability of such information to partiesthat may rely on having access to it. The Department has found that therequirement can be met without allowing additional time for submissionof the nonproprietary summary. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.32(c) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party states that, rather than require submittersto anticipate arguments supporting a request for disclosure, the Departmentshould allow submitters 48 hours to rebut arguments in favor of disclosureafter the Department receives such arguments. The Department should modifythe last sentence of paragraph (c) accordingly. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>It is unnecessary to provide in the regulationan additional opportunity for argument in opposition to release of submittedinformation under protective order. Our experience has been that the submitteralmost always is aware of the arguments at the time the information issubmitted. Therefore, the submitter is capable of presenting any argumentsagainst disclosure at that time. Moreover, this requirement is essentialto avoid unnecessary delay in release of such information that in the pasthas resulted from repetitive submissions supporting and opposing release.Only in the most extraordinary situation would the Department make an exceptionto this rule and provide the submitter an additional opportunity for comment.As drafted, the last sentence of this paragraph adequately covers suchan exception. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.32(d) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>Two parties contend that 48 hours is too short a periodin which to require resubmission of information that the Department hasdetermined does not conform to the requirements of this section. Suggestedtime limits are one week or five business days. Another party suggeststhat the Department should not immediately return the nonconforming submission,but rather should allow the submitter five days to supply the additionalinformation needed for compliance. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>Because the requirements of this sectionare clearly stated and known to the submitter in advance of submission,the submitter should have no difficulty meeting the short deadline forresubmission. Nonconforming portions of a public summary should be quicklyand easily correctible by the local representative of the submitter. Wehave changed the regulation, however, so that the time period runs fromwhen the submitter receives the Department's explanation for return ofthe submission. When the submitter picks up the returned information andexplanation at the Department, the time of receipt is the time of pick-up.In order to clarify that the 48-hour period does not include weekends andfederal holidays, we are changing the stated deadline to ``two businessdays.'' We also have modified the proposal to clarify that nonconforminginformation will not be considered. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.32(f) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party suggests that the Department should: (1) modifyparagraph (f)(2) to provide that before proprietary data are disclosedto an outside consultant to the Department, the consultant's credentialsshall be made available to the submitter so that possible conflicts ofinterest can be identified; and (2) modify paragraph (f)(4) to specifythat disclosure to the Customs Service is limited to investigations regardingfraud relating directly to the antidumping duty investigation, as requiredby section 777(b)(1) of the Act. Another party suggests that employeesof the Justice Department who are involved in a judicial review of a proceedingshould be included in the list of persons to whom the Secretary may discloseproprietary information. The list also should include disclosure to anyperson when otherwise required by law.<T3> Department's Position:</T3> With regard to the comment on paragraph(f)(2), the Department's contract with any outside consultant requiresfull disclosure of information that will identify potential conflicts ofinterest. We will continue our current practice of conferring with interestedparties to supplement this information.In response to the comment on paragraph (f)(4), we have modified the languageof this paragraph to clarify that the scope of this provision is limitedto matters relating to antidumping duty proceedings.The Department of Justice does not need to be included in the list of partiesthat may receive business proprietary data because it receives such dataas agent of the Department of Commerce. As to disclosure to other parties,we are not aware of any other party that would have authority to receiveproprietary data, although the Department would be responsive, of course,to court order in this respect.We note that, to be consistent with changes made to the countervailingduty regulations, we have modified paragraph (f) to permit release of proprietaryinformation, under Part 354 of this title (19 CFR Part 354), to a partycharged with violating an APO or counsel for such a charged party.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.34</ITAG><T3> Comment:</T3> One party would expedite release of proprietary informationby requiring the Department to rule on a ``blanket'' application withina short time after it is filed (<T3>e.g.,</T3> 10 days after receipt of the request, with the possibilityof an extension to 15 days in unusual circumstances). This party suggeststhat the proposed regulation also be amended to provide that the partysubmitting proprietary information subject to the protective order directlyserve on the protective order recipient proprietary information that thesubmitter agrees should be released. If the submitter does not agree thatthe information should be released, it should be required to explain itsreasons for opposing release at the time it submits the information.This same party argues that the regulation should provide that verificationexhibits and computer tapes may be released under a protective order. Failureto release this information prevents identification of substantive issuesin cases until subsequent judicial review, and serves only to increasethe costs of analyzing respondents' data and checking for possible computationalerrors or the impact alternative decisions would have on the investigationresults.Another party contends that the implicit provision in the proposed regulationfor the routine granting of blanket requests for release of confidentialinformation under administrative protective order is inconsistent withstatutory requirements. Under the statute, requests for release of information,whether prospective or otherwise, must describe with particularity thereasons for the request and the information requested. The commenter believesthat the Department needs to focus on its administration of the APO provisions,and contends that the Department often is unaware of the post-investigationdisposition of APO material in many investigations.<T3> Department's Position:</T3> The Department makes every effort to expediteits decisions on release of information. Normally the decision is madewithin 14 days of receipt of the application. However, in proceedings involving,for example, a large volume of different types of information or complexissues relevant to the balancing test described in paragraph (a), the Departmentmay need some additional time. We have modified paragraph (b) to indicatethat the normal time period for the Department's decision is not more than14 days. This is reflected in section 1332 of the 1988 Act.Regarding service of proprietary information subject to protective order,we are modifying paragraph (a) to indicate that the Department may requiredirect service of the proprietary information on the recipient of the protectiveorder. The first sentence of paragraph (a) now reads in part ``the Secretarymay disclose, or require to be disclosed* * *.'' The Department normallywould require direct service when the submitter has agreed in advance,under andSection; 353.32(c), to release submitted information under protectiveorder. If the submitter does not agree to release of information underAPO, andSection; 353.32(c) requires that it state ``which portions of theproprietary information should not be released under administrative protectiveorder and all arguments supporting that conclusion for each portion.''Almost all verification exhibits are exempt from disclosure under APO becausethey are not necessary to an understanding of either the calculations orthe reasons a particular methodology is chosen. In these instances, theyserve only to assist the analyst in preparing the verification report.In rare situations, a document accepted at verification may be needed tocalculate foreign market value or U.S. price; in such an instance, thedocument would be releasable under APO. As with any other proprietary data, the issue of whether the Departmentwill release, or require to be released, under administrative protectiveorder computer tapes submitted by respondents must be determined on a case-by-casebasis. Such a determination will be based on whether the need for accessto the proprietary data contained on computer tape outweighs any interestin withholding data. <T3>See </T3>andSection; 353.34(a); <T3>see also Yale Materials Handling Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>Slip Op. 87-121, 11 CIT<T2>XX</T2>(November 3, 1987); <T3>Timken Co. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>Slip Op. 87-45, 11 CIT<T2>XX</T2>(April 6, 1987). If the Department concludes that the need foraccess to the proprietary data on computer tape outweighs any interestin withholding the data, the Department will require the party to releaseits redacted computer tapes directly to opposing counsel, at the opposingparty's expense, under the terms of an APO specifically written to providea heightened degree of protection. The Department believes this is a reasonableapproach. We note, however, that the Department will not in any way assumethe great burden and expense of creating or modifying tapes for a party.In other words, the Department will not redact a party's computer tapesnor will we create computer tapes of our SAS program logs or SAS data sets.As the Department explained in the preamble to the proposed regulations,``[p]aragraph (b) implements section 619(4) of the 1984 Act, which authorizesstanding requests for disclosure of information for the duration of eachsegment of a proceeding that culminates in a judicially reviewable decision* * * . The regulation recognizes that the standard in section 777(c) forparticularity of description of requested information must be read in lightof the 1984 Act's provision for requesting information before the Departmentreceives it, or even before the information exists.'' 51 FR 29053 (August13, 1986). Approval of release of information in advance of its submissiondoes not impede the Department's ability to balance the competing interestsof submitter and requester. The types of information submitted in antidumpingproceedings are well-known to all parties in advance of submission. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>andSection; 353.4. Contrary to the commenter's assertion,the Department carefully balances the competing interests in each caseprior to granting the release of information under a blanket administrativeprotective order. Moreover, before the administrative protective orderlapses at the completion of a segment of a proceeding, the Department requiresthat the proprietary information either be subject to the terms of an existingjudicial protective order or that the representative destroy or returnthe proprietary information and certify that it has fully complied withthe terms of the order. This practice is reflected in paragraph (d) ofthis section. <T3>See </T3>51 FR 29054 (August 13, 1986). <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.34(b) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party sees no valid reason for the short time limitsspecified in paragraph (b)(1). For example, although a party may at firstchoose not to participate actively in a proceeding, the party may decidelater in the proceeding to participate actively and, therefore, to requestaccess to information under protective order. The Department should considerrequests for release of information even if submitted later than the timelimits specified in paragraph (b)(1). Another party argues that in-house counsel should not be granted accessto proprietary information. It urges that paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of thissection should be amended so that an interested party's ``representatives''will not include its employees. Disclosure of proprietary information toin-house counsel or other employees of the interested party would defeatthe purpose of an APO, and would be contrary to Congressional intent topreserve the distinction between in-house counsel and outside counsel.Another party argues that confidential information should be released underadministrative protective order only to attorneys. It notes that otherindividuals are not subject to the same sanctions as are attorneys shouldan APO be violated. Regarding paragraph (b)(2), one party suggests that we delete the standardform requirement, because it ignores the possibility that special circumstancesmay justify deviation from the standard form. Regarding paragraph (b)(4), one party suggests that the proposed rule bemodified to ensure that ``the taint of a person who violates a protectiveorder'' does not affect that person's firm, partner, associates, employees,and employer after that person is no longer employed or associated withthem, and likewise does not affect the new firm or employer of that person.This party also believes that additional protection is needed to ensurethat consultants do not inadvertently disclose confidential informationto a competing company. Another party disagrees with the requirement (statedin the preamble to the proposed rule) that the party's attorney (and thelaw firm) take responsibility for violation of a protective order by consultantsassisting the attorney. This party believes that the sanctions listed wouldapply with the same effect to consultants, and that the person committingthe violation should be held responsible for his actions. There shouldbe no distinction between consultants who work with attorneys and thosewho do not. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>Time limits for requesting disclosure ofinformation under administrative protective order are necessary to eliminatethe possibility that the Department will receive a request too late toprocess it in time to ensure timely disclosure of information. The timelimits also are intended to eliminate the administrative burden of processingmultiple requests from the same person and to encourage the filing of requeststhat cover information not yet submitted in the segment of the proceedingat issue. <T3>See </T3>H.R. Rep. No. 725, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 44-45 (1984). Becausethe application may be submitted in advance of submission of the information,there is no reason for a party that may want to participate in an investigationor an administrative review to delay submitting the requests. On the otherhand, submission of the application for disclosure does not obligate aparty to participate actively in the investigation or administrative review.We do agree, however, that the time limits in the proposed rule may beshorter than necessary for the intended purpose. Accordingly, we are modifyingparagraph (b) to provide that requests for disclosure be submitted notlater than either 30 days after the date the notice of initiation is publishedin the<T4> Federal Register </T4>(rather than 10 days as provided in the proposedrule) or, if later, 10 days after the date the representative's clientor employer becomes a party to the proceeding, but in no event later thanthe date the case briefs, under andSection; 353.38, are due. The time limitsare reasonable and consistent with the purpose of the Act. In conducting the balancing test described in paragraph (a), the Departmentgives special consideration to the situation of in-house counsel and thepossibility of inadvertent disclosure. For example, we do not permit disclosureto any in-house counsel who is also an officer of the company that is aparty to the proceeding. The Department's policy for evaluating competinginterests in requests for disclosure to in-house counsel, consultants,and other non-attorney representatives has developed in the context ofspecific proceedings. Given the fact that we still have relatively littleexperience with respect to disclosure to such persons, we do not believethat this is an appropriate subject for rulemaking at this time. The Department releases proprietary information under protective orderto consultants and non-attorney representatives when it concludes thatthere is sufficient evidence of a particular need for the individual'sexpertise in analyzing the information on behalf of a party to the proceeding,and only when the Department is satisfied that the information will beprotected from unauthorized disclosure. Consistent with the legislativehistory of section 777 of the Act, the Department ``generally'' releasesinformation under administrative protective order ``only to attorneys whoare subject to disbarment from practice before the agency in the eventof a violation of the order.'' S. Rep. No. 249, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 101(1979). When the Department releases information under APO to consultantsand other non-attorney representatives, these individuals are subject tothe same sanctions as are attorneys for any violation of the order. <T3>See </T3>the Department's final rule entitled ``Procedures for ImposingSanctions for Violation of an Antidumping or Countervailing Duty ProtectiveOrder,'' 53 FR 47916 (November 28, 1988). The standard form requirement reduces significantly the administrativeburden of reviewing requests for consistency with the law. It also simplifiesthe process for the requester. The standard form covers ``special situations,''such as in-house counsel and non-attorney representatives. We have modified paragraph (b)(4) to reference the sanctions listed inandSection; 354.3 of the Department's final rule entitled ``Procedures forImposing Sanctions for Violation of an Antidumping or Countervailing DutyProtective Order,'' 53 FR 47916 (November 28, 1988). The sanctions arenecessary and appropriate for ensuring the effectiveness of the Department'sprotective order. Under the proposed rules, the person who violates a protectiveorder is held responsible, be it an attorney or other professional representative.Holding the employer, partner, and others in the firm or company responsibleto the extent of debarring the firm or company from practice before theDepartment is consistent with the need for strict compliance with the termsof protective orders, although that sanction would be exceedingly rareand would be appropriate only when the firm's actions, practice, or policieshave contributed to the violation. Section 354.3 gives the decisionmakera broad range of sanctions to deal with all possible types and degree ofviolations.We note that, to be consistent with changes made to the countervailingduty regulations, we have revised paragraph (b)(3)(ii) to refer to ``thesegment of the proceeding in which [the information] was submitted,'' insteadof ``the segment of the proceeding then in progress,'' to allow for thepossibility that segments may occur simultaneously. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.34(c) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>Two parties state that the 24-hour time limit for decidingwhether or not to withdraw proprietary information is unreasonably shortbecause it does not provide an adequate opportunity for communication betweenthe submitting party and its counsel. Three working days is suggested asa reasonable alternative. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>Because the submitter of proprietary informationcan and should anticipate that disclosure under protective order is possible,the submitter also should anticipate having to decide whether or not towithdraw the information submitted. Nonetheless, we have modified the timelimit to two business days in order to ensure that all parties have anopportunity to consider withdrawing the information after the Departmentmakes its decision to disclose the information. Three days for this purposewould unnecessarily delay disclosure. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.34(d) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>According to one party, there is no need to impose anarbitrary 15-day time limit on filing a request for a judicial protectiveorder. When judicial action is instituted, all interested parties shouldbe allowed to retain the information obtained under administrative protectiveorder until they no longer have the opportunity to intervene in the judicialproceeding. The preamble to the proposed rule states that the Department will not releaseproprietary information after it makes a judicially reviewable determination``because the need to prepare for judicial review is not an adequate reasonfor additional disclosure.'' Two parties argue that if the Department refusesto disclose final calculations (whether before or after a final determination),interested parties cannot identify clerical errors in the determination.Disclosure of final calculations under protective order would assist theDepartment in discovering and correcting these errors. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The proposed rule significantly expandsthe right of a person to retain protective order information after theend of a judicially reviewable segment of an administrative proceeding.The time limit set forth in this paragraph might be 120 days after thedate of publication of an antidumping duty order, because (1) a party tothe proceeding has 30 days from that date to file the summons and another30 days to file the complaint, (2) the Department has 45 days from thelatter date to file the administrative record, and (3) the party that hasthe information subject to administrative protective order has an additional15 days to file a request for judicial protective order. To permit a partyto retain the information until the party no longer has a right to intervenein the judicial proceeding would in effect move the deadline back to anindeterminate date late in the judicial proceeding. Unless the party promptlydecides to pursue the matter in court, there is no reason to allow thatparty to retain the business proprietary information. Continued retentionof the documents merely would increase the risk that they might be lostor disclosed inadvertently. Regarding disclosure of the Department's calculations after issuing itsfinal determination, section 1333 of the 1988 Act requires correction ofministerial errors following a final determination. The Department hasprovided for such disclosure in the clerical error correction procedures(published at 53 FR 41617 (October 24, 1988) and 53 FR 5813 (February 26,1988)) and in andSection; 353.20(e) of these regulations. <T3>See </T3>the Department's response to comments on andSection; 353.20(a).<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.34(e) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party suggests that the regulations should includea strict time limit of 60 days for the issuance of a charging letter ininvestigations of APO violations. The commenter contends that these investigationsnow take so long that the Department's commitment to impose sanctions forAPO violations is in question. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We have modified this paragraph to providethat alleged violations of protective orders will be handled under theprocedures of Part 354 of this title. In Part 354, we have adopted timelimits for the investigation of whether there is reasonable cause to believethat an APO violation occurred in a proceeding and for the decision whetherto issue a charging letter to the party in question. <T3>See </T3>the Department's final rule entitled ``Procedures for ImposingSanctions for Violation of an Antidumping or Countervailing Duty ProtectiveOrder, 53 FR 47916 (November 28, 1988). <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.35 </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party contends that this section should require thememorandum of an <T3>ex parte </T3>meeting to report all legal arguments and nonfactualrepresentations made at the meeting.

This party also suggests that the regulations should require theDepartment to serve copies of such memoranda on parties to the proceedingwithin seven days of the <T3>ex parte </T3>meeting. Another party recommends that the regulationsspecify a deadline when such memoranda must be placed in the reading file,<T3>e.g., </T3>five work days after the <T3>ex parte </T3>meeting.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> This section conforms to the requirementsof section 777(a)(3) of the Act, and is consistent with the cited legislativehistory of that section of the Act.

Moreover, the HouseReport accompanying the 1984 Act specifies that verification ``would notbe required if it has occurred upon timely request in the two immediatelyprevious [administrative] reviews * * *.'' H.R. Rep. No. 725, 98th Cong.,2d Sess. 43 (1984).Three parties contend that there is no statutory authority for the samplingprocedure described in paragraph (a)(2). They believe the sampling authorityin section 777A of the Act is limited to the use of sampling in analysisof sales and price information, and does not cover sampling in selectionof respondents for questionnaire responses or verification. These partiesargue that it would be unreasonable to apply the results of one company'sverification to other companies whose submissions have not been verified.Two of these parties contend that if, for the sake of administrative convenience,the Department refuses to verify a respondent's submission, the data shouldbe treated as the ``best information available.'' Any company that is willingto undergo verification is entitled to have its determination based onits own information. Moreover, because the Department cannot levy an antidumpingduty when there are no sales at less than foreign market value, interestedparties have an absolute right to verification and to have margins calculatedbased on the results of the individual verification.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Section 776(b) of the Act requires theDepartment to conduct a verification, upon request, if no verificationwas conducted ``during the 2 immediately preceding reviews'' of the sameorder. In addition, the statute permits the Department to verify any administrativereview for good cause. The legislative history expands on the statutorydirective, stating that the Department need not conduct a verificationof the third administrative review if it has verified ``in the two immediatelyprevious [administrative] reviews'' of that order or finding. H.R. Rep.No. 725, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 43 (1984). This means that the Departmentonly is required to conduct a verification on request in the third reviewif there were no verification in the first or second review. This interpretationis consistent with the further admonishment in the legislative historythat the purpose of the amendment was to eliminate ``an unnecessary administrativeburden on the Department of Commerce'' and ``perfunctory verifications.''<T3> Id.</T3> The amendments implicitly overruled<T3> Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp. </T3>v.<T3> United States,</T3> 6 CIT 243 (1983),<T3> aff'd, </T3>745 F.2d 632 (Fed. Cir. 1984), which held that the Departmentmust conduct a verification of submissions in each administrative review.The legislative history also states that the amendment ``generally codifiesthe current administrative practice of the Department of Commerce,'' whichwas to verify information in administrative reviews when the Departmentbelieved there was good cause for verification. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1156,98th Cong., 2d Sess. 177 (1984). Regarding the Department's practice, see<T3>Stainless Steel Wire Rods from France,</T3> 48 FR 2808-09 (1983). Inview of the language of section 776(b) and the legislative purpose, paragraph(a)(1)(v)(B) of the proposed rule is a reasonable interpretation of section776(b) of the Act. Unless the Department ``decides that good cause forverification exists'' (andSection; 353.36(a)(1)(iv)), there is no need forverification in more than one out of three consecutive administrative reviews.Regarding the authority to use sampling in selecting respondents that willreceive questionnaires or in conducting verifications in administrativereviews of antidumping duty orders, section 777A of the Act states thatthe Department may use generally recognized sampling techniques ``for thepurpose of carrying out [administrative] reviews under section 751.'' TheConference Report on the 1984 Act specifically describes the provisionas expanding ``the instances in which the administering authority may usesampling and averaging techniques * * * in carrying out [administrative]reviews of outstanding AD or CUD [sic] orders under section 751 * * *.''H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1156, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 186 (1984). The only qualificationin section 777A is that ``a significant volume of sales is involved ora significant number of adjustments to prices is required.'' Under thecircumstances described in andSection; 353.36(a)(2), this qualification issatisfied.Section 777A(b) specifically provides that the Department has exclusiveauthority to select ``appropriate'' samples and averages (whether of respondentsor of individual sales or adjustments) that are ``representative of thetransactions under investigation.'' As to the comments that it is unreasonableto apply the results of one company's verification to another, the commenterseither misunderstand the concept of sampling or are criticizing the inclusionin the statute of the Department's authority to sample. Nevertheless, weagree completely that sampling of companies for verification is a matterrequiring particular care in selecting the sampling methodology in orderto prevent distorted results. We note that we have revised paragraph (a)(2) to clarify that the selectionof a sample of companies or sales for verification could occur in an investigationas well as in an administrative review. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.36(c) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>Regarding the timing of verification, one party wouldmodify paragraph (c) to state that, whenever feasible, verification willtake place prior to a preliminary determination. This party also urgesthe Department to provide in the regulation that interested parties willbe given a copy of the verification outline 10 days prior to verification.The commenter suggests that parties be given seven days to comment on theoutline. This party believes that the agency should attempt to visit thedomestic industry prior to verification to collect information about issuesthat should be addressed during verification. This party also suggests that we add to the regulation a statement of proceduresfor issuing verification reports and receiving comments on the reports.The commenter recommends that the regulation require the Department toissue its report within 14 days of verification. In addition, they urgethat the regulation provide that the verification report will include allverification exhibits; these exhibits should be released either publiclyor under protective order, as appropriate. The Department's blanket policyof refusing to release verification exhibits prevents the active participationof the domestic industry in the investigation or review. The regulationalso should provide seven days for comment after receipt of the report.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We have decided not to modify paragraph(c) to provide that ``whenever feasible'' verification will take placeprior to the date of the preliminary determination. Although the Departmentdoes in practice conduct verification as early as possible, nothing isgained by placing on the Department an obligation to explain its decisionto verify after a preliminary determination rather than before. The Departmentis as much concerned about the quality of the verification as about itstiming. We conduct verification after the date of the preliminary determinationwhen we determine that there is inadequate time or opportunity to conducta thorough verification before that date. The Department prepares verification outlines as far in advance of thescheduled dates for verification as possible. Normally all parties to theproceeding have an opportunity to submit comments and suggestions. Thispractice has worked well and there is no reason to define the practiceor time limits in the regulation. The Department places the highest priority on prompt preparation and releaseof verification reports. The amount of time, however, that is requiredto complete a verification report is a function of the complexity and lengthof verification, the date and place of verification, and other demandson the verifiers' time (such as statutory deadlines in other pending cases).Under these circumstances, regulatory deadlines are inappropriate. Similarly,the content of the verification report is an administrative matter bestleft to a case-by-case approach. Regarding the comment on release of verificationexhibits, see the Department's response to comments on andSection; 353.34.We note that we have modified paragraph (c) to reflect the Department'spractice of verifying the completeness, as well as the accuracy, of informationsubmitted. The Department considers completeness to be one indication ofaccuracy. <T3>See also </T3>andSection; 353.37(a)(2).<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.37</ITAG><T3> Comment:</T3> Three parties suggest that the regulation specify thatwhen the inability to verify is not the fault of the respondent, the bestinformation available will be deemed to be the factual information submitted.Another party argues that in cases when the inability to verify is therespondent's fault, the Department should not simply use the informationsubmitted by petitioners as the ``best information,'' but rather shoulduse what is actualIy the best and most accurate information available tothe Department. According to two parties, the regulation should provide that, prior tousing the best information available, the Department should be requiredto notify the producer or reseller of the deficiencies in its submissionsand allow that party to correct or supplement the incomplete or inaccuratedata. Another party contends that the proposed regulation conflicts with theclear statutory directive that the agency must use the best informationavailable if responses are incomplete, inaccurate, untimely, or cannotbe verified. The regulation should be revised to state that the Secretary``shall,'' not ``may,'' use the best information available in such instances. Another party suggests that the regulations specify that when informationcannot be verified or is not timely submitted, the Department shall notethis in the public record so that interested parties will know that ``thebest information'' will be used. The commenter explains that this willgive importers advance notice of potential substantial assessments.<T3> Department's Position:</T3> Verification is designed to establishthe accuracy and completeness of a questionnaire response. If either ofthose factors cannot be established, regardless of ``fault,'' the Departmentmust, under the statute, adopt the ``best information otherwise available,''which is the subject of this section.<T3> See Atlantic Sugar, Ltd. </T3>v.<T3> United States,</T3> 744 F.2d 1556 (Fed. Cir. 1984). When the inability to verify is the respondent's fault, the Departmentgenerally uses information that is based on inferences adverse to the respondentwhen selecting the ``best information available.'' <T3>See Atlantic Sugar Ltd. </T3>v.<T3> United States,</T3> 744 F.2d 1556, 1560 (Fed. Cir. 1984). We notethat paragraph (b) is intended to permit, rather than require, use of factualinformation submitted in support of the petition as best information available.To make this point as clear as possible, we have modified the paragraphto state ``may include'' rather than ``includes.'' Prior to resorting to best information available, the Department as amatter of practice often allows a respondent to correct a deficiency ina submission. First, the Department may request a supplemental submissionof information after it receives a deficient response to the questionnairereferred to in  andSection; 353.31(b). Second, the Department often permitsa respondent to correct a deficiency during the verification process, dependingon the nature and scope of the deficiency. Under andSection; 353.31(b), theDepartment has the authority to request an additional submission at anytime during the proceeding, but, under andSection; 353.31(a), the respondent'sright to submit factual information is subject to certain time limits necessitatedby statutory deadlines. Although the statute does not require it, the Departmentusually does notify respondents of deficiencies in submissions. In response to the comment, we have revised paragraph (a) of this sectionto indicate that the Secretary will use the ``best information available''in the situations described in that section.As to the comment regarding notice in the public record that the best informationavailable provision is being applied in a case, this would be literallyimpossible in cases involving thousands, sometimes hundreds of thousands,of pieces of discrete information. When practicable, the Department doesidentify, either in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice or elsewhere in the record of the proceeding,that the ``best information available'' was used. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.38 </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>Several parties state that the time limits for submissionof case briefs are unreasonable for one or more of the following reasons:(1) the Department often does not issue its verification reports untilafter the time limits expire; (2) the Department often does not provideinformation under protective order until shortly before or even after thetime limits expire; and (3) respondents often do not obtain disclosureof the preliminary determination or results of review until two weeks afterit is published and, at the same time, may be preparing for verification.Thus, the unreasonable time limits in paragraphs (b) and (c) make it impossiblefor interested parties to comment on important information in the recordof the proceeding. Moreover, it is inappropriate for the Department toexclude from the record any relevant information filed by a party, thusdenying the reviewing court the opportunity to decide whether the submissionshould have been considered in the administrative proceeding. Suggested changes include the following: (1) allow parties to comment onissues that arise after the proposed deadlines; (2) provide more realistictime periods for the requested briefs; (3) provide that the Secretary canalter the time in which to file a case brief in an administrative review,just as he may do so in an investigation; and (4) permit separate submissionof written comments on the verification report. One party believes thatthe Department should distribute more evenly the time limits for case andrebuttal briefs in order to provide sufficient time to respond to all issuesthat may be raised in a case brief. They suggest extending the time limitfor filing rebuttal briefs to 14 days after the time limit for case briefs.Another party suggests clarifying that the Department does not intend tolimit submissions of written comments prior to the date of the preliminarydetermination and the case brief. Several parties urge the Department to permit post-hearing briefs. Theybelieve such briefs are necessary to cover new arguments that may be madeat a hearing, to clarify statements that may be made at a hearing, andto provide complete answers to questions the Department may raise at ahearing. One party suggests that the Department could limit the lengthof such briefs to 10 double-spaced pages, as the Commission does, in orderto ensure that arguments are concise and selective. Regarding paragraph (b), one party suggests that, rather than requiringall issues relevant to the final determination or results of review tobe ``presented in full'' in the case brief, the Department only shouldrequire all such issues to be identified; to the extent issues were notpreviously briefed, arguments should be presented in full. One party believes that allowing other government agencies to file caseor rebuttal briefs will dilute the authority of the Secretary of Commerceand will inhibit effective and timely implementation of the antidumpingstatute. They suggest deletion of the references to other agencies in paragraphs(b) and (c). <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department believes that the time limitsin this section will provide all interested parties a reasonable opportunityto comment on the record of the proceeding. In administrative reviews,the Department's practice is to conduct verifications prior to the scheduleddate of the preliminary determination. This practice allows the partiesto the proceeding sufficient opportunity for preparation of case and rebuttalbriefs after they have obtained access to the verification report and allfactual information. In investigations, the regulation will encourage theDepartment to conduct its verification as early as possible. We have extendedthe deadlines for submission of case and rebuttal briefs in investigationsin order to increase the likelihood that parties will be able to commenton verification reports or other factual information, without curtailingthe Department's ability to consider and to address the parties' commentsin the final determination. Paragraph (c) (proposed paragraph (b)) alreadycontains adequate authority for the Department to alter the time limitsfor submission of case briefs in an investigation to cover the situationsdescribed in the comments. Paragraph (d) (proposed paragraph (c)) likewisepermits the Department, as appropriate, to adjust the time limit for submissionof rebuttal briefs. In this manner, the regulation ensures that the Departmentretains the necessary discretion to establish realistic time limits inany proceeding in which the normal time limits are too short. We also haverevised these regulations to clarify that the Department will return untimelyor nonconforming submissions to the submitter with written notice statingthe reasons for return of the documents. The written notice, which willdetail the untimely or nonconforming nature of the submission, will beplaced in the record of the proceeding. The reviewing court, therefore,will be able to decide whether the submission should have been consideredin the administrative proceeding. The regulation does not limit submissions of written argument prior tothe date of the preliminary determination or after that date and priorto the submission of the case briefs.Regarding the suggestion that the Department permit post-hearing briefs,we believe the case and rebuttal briefs afford each party to the proceedingample opportunity to address the issues and to comment on the factual information.Moreover, under paragraph (f)(3) (proposed paragraph (e)(3)) of this section,the presiding officer at the hearing ``may question any interested partyor witness and may request interested parties to present additional writtenargument.'' These procedures, we believe, eliminate the need for post-hearingbriefs in every case, particularly in view of the fact that all issuesaddressed at the hearing first must be addressed in the case or rebuttalbrief. We have modified paragraph (f)(3) to clarify that parties may submitadditional written argument only at the Department's request. The requirement in paragraph (c)(2) (proposed paragraph (b)(2)) that theparty ``separately present in full'' all arguments which the party wantsthe Department to consider in the final determination or final resultsof review is important given the difficult task the Department often facesat that late date in the investigation or administrative review. The convenienceof having all arguments consolidated in a few submissions outweighs theadditional effort required of the interested parties. If necessary, theparty to the proceeding may attach to the case brief as appendices therelevant portions of earlier submissions rather than re-write an entireargument. We disagree with the comment that allowing other agencies to file caseor rebuttal briefs will dilute the Department's authority and will hinderenforcement of the antidumping statute. In the past, other agencies (suchas the Federal Trade Commission) have filed briefs in proceedings beforethe Department, and we did not in any way experience the problems thatthe commenter suggests will occur. We note that, to be consistent with changes made in the countervailingduty regulations, we have added a new paragraph (b), which concerns requestsfor hearings. We have added this paragraph to allow sufficient time forall parties and the Department to prepare for a hearing. In addition, wehave modified paragraph (e) (proposed paragraph (d)) to require the submitterof a case or rebuttal brief to serve a copy of the brief on any U.S. governmentagency that has submitted a case or rebuttal brief. We also have revisedparagraph (f) (proposed paragraph (e)) to provide that hearings ordinarilywill be held seven days (instead of 14 days) after the scheduled date forsubmission of rebuttal briefs in an administrative review. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart D </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>As we explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, SubpartD simply collects in one subpart all of the provisions that explain thecalculation of U.S. price or foreign market value. 51 FR 29055 (August13, 1986).

Comments on provisionsin Subpart D that were unchanged by the proposed rule are not germane tothis rulemaking. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.41(e) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party contends that the Department's proposal toremove the phrase ``in the United States'' from paragraph (e) is contraryto the statute and the Department's practice. Section 772(e) of the Actprovides that adjustments are to be made to exporter's sales price (``ESP'')for indirect selling expenses ``incurred by or for the account of the exporterin the United States * * *'' The commenter argues that because section771(13) of the Act defines exporter as including the exporter's agentsand subsidiaries in the United States, the phrase ``in the United States''in section 772(e) must be interpreted as modifying ``expenses incurred,''not as modifying ``exporter.'' Otherwise, the statutory phrase would besuperfluous. In addition, the commenter notes that proposed andSection; 353.56(b)(2)would set the ESP offset cap as the amount of indirect selling expenses``incurred in the United States.'' Because the cap is intended to limitthe adjustment to foreign market value for indirect selling expenses tothe extent of the adjustment to U.S. price made under section 772(e)(2)of the Act, section 772(e)(2) must be read as permitting an adjustmentto U.S. price only for expenses ``incurred in the United States.'' <T3>Department's Position: </T3>In determining the amount of indirect sellingexpenses incurred in selling the merchandise in the United States, theDepartment does not consider relevant the geographic location where expenseswere incurred. This practice has been affirmed in the Court's decisionin <T3>Silver Reed, America, Inc. v. United States, </T3>Slip Op. 88-37, 12CIT<T2>XX</T2> (March 18, 1988).As the commenter notes, the language in andSection; 353.56(b)(2) should bethe same as in this section. That is, an ESP offset would be permittedfor indirect expenses incurred in selling the merchandise in the UnitedStates, wherever those expenses are incurred. We, therefore, have clarifiedandSection; 353.56(b)(2) so that it corresponds to andSection; 353.41(e).<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.42</ITAG><T3> Comment:</T3> One party suggests that paragraph (b)(1) be amendedto state that the Secretary normally will examine not less than 60 percent``of the dollar value and volume'' of the merchandise, with the percentagesof each being ``roughly equivalent.'' This party explains that the useof alternative measures, <T3>i.e.,</T3> value or volume, may lead to inaccurate results. The Departmentshould seek a representative sample, and thus should examine foreign respondentsthat constitute an equivalent share of both volume and value of merchandise.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree with the commenter's assumptionthat an examination of 60 percent of both the volume and value of the merchandiseis necessary to constitute a representative measure of selling activity.In many cases, a value and volume measurement produce ``roughly equivalent''results. That, however, is not always the case. In some instances, forexample, products within the same class or kind have widely divergent pricesbecause quality varies. As proposed, paragraph (b)(1) gives the Departmentdiscretion to consider either value or volume, or both, or to concentrate,as we have in some recent cases, on those producers or resellers that accountfor 60 percent of the volume or value (or both) of the merchandise.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.43</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> One party comments that the proposed regulation shouldclarify the circumstances under which the Department will consider offersfor sales in determining foreign market value. They suggest that a sentencebe added to paragraph (a) stating that the Secretary may consider offersfor sale, even when actual sales have been made, if reference to thoseoffers is relevant to establish the adequacy and accuracy of the actualsales reported. They explain that when sales of the subject merchandisein the home market have been made at low volumes, the Department shouldconsider prices reflected in offers for sale to determine if prices reportedfor actual transactions are an accurate measure of foreign market value.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The situation described by the commenteris one in which the Secretary has the discretion under the regulationsas proposed to depart from the ``normal'' rule of considering offers onlyin the absence of sales.<ITAG tagnum="74">Sec. 353.48</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Because verifications are not required in all administrativereviews, we have revised paragraph (b) accordingly.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Sec. 353.52</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> We are drafting a proposed rule and request for commentsto implement the 1988 Act amendments regarding dumping by nonmarket economycountries.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.55</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> One party recommends that the Department include in theproposed regulation the paragraph contained in andSection; 353.14(c) of thecurrent regulation concerning the consideration of price lists when makingadjustments for differences in quantities. This party notes that the Department'spreamble to the proposed rule states that the paragraph was deleted ``becausein substance it is identical to andSection; 353.3(b) of the proposed rule.''Section 353.3(b) concerns the public record, however, and does not dealwith the issue of the consideration of price lists when making adjustmentsfor differences in quantities.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The reference to andSection; 353.3(b) wasa typographical error. The correct reference is andSection; 353.55(b).

If the Department does not adopt their suggestedchange to andSection; 353.41(e), which would insert ``in the United States''in paragraph (e), they suggest that andSection; 353.56(b)(2) be revised toclarify that the ESP offset cap is the amount of the adjustment allowedunder section 772(e)(2) of the Act, not just the amount of indirect sellingexpenses incurred in the United States.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>This paragraph has been revised to clarifythat the ESP offset cap is the expense incurred ``in selling the merchandise,''which is the amount of the adjustment that would be made under andSection;353.41(e). That is, an adjustment would be made for the expenses of sellingthe merchandise, whether incurred in the United States or elsewhere. Notethe definition of ``the merchandise'' in andSection; 353.2(m). The phrase``expenses incurred in selling'' is intended to convey the same meaningas ``selling expenses'' in the current regulation. To be consistent, wealso have revised the proposed rule to clarify that the indirect sellingexpenses, whether incurred in the United States or elsewhere, may be offsetby indirect selling expenses incurred on sales of such or similar merchandise,regardless of where incurred. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.59(a) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party argues that the Department should have includedin the proposed regulation the last sentence of the existing regulationproviding that adjustments will not be disregarded if it will significantlyaffect the calculation results. The party believes that the deleted sentenceclarifies that adjustments that would normally be viewed as insignificantshould not be disregarded if doing so would result in dumping margins incases where no margin would otherwise have been found, or vice versa. Becausethe Department indicated in the preamble to the proposed rule that thesentence was deleted only because it was redundant, the party urges thatit be incorporated in the final rule in the interest of clarity. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We continue to believe the referenced sentenceis redundant. The regulation is not intended to change the Department'spractice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sec. 353.60(a) </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party argues that proposed andSection; 353.60 incorrectlyprovides for the conversion of currencies on the date of sale in the UnitedStates. This is contrary to Congressional intent and to the longstandingadministrative practice of determining exchange rates in exporter's salesprice calculations as of the date of exportation of the investigated merchandise.The commenter explains that the change results from the reference in proposedandSection; 353.60 to proposed andSection;andSection; 353.46, 353.49, and 353.50.The changes in those sections are explained as having been made to implementsection 615(1) of the 1984 Act. Although section 615 of the 1984 Act didchange the comparison date to the date of sale in exporter's sales pricetransactions, and proposed andSection;andSection; 353.46, 353.49, and 353.50do implement those sales date changes, section 615(1) did not specify anew rule for the currency conversions. Moreover, the statutory provisiongoverning currency conversions, 31 U.S.C. 5151, indicates that whenevercurrencies are converted for assessment and collection of duties, the generalrule is that conversion is to be made at values prevailing during the quarterin which exportation of the merchandise occurs. There is no authority toconvert currencies on the date of sale in the United States. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>Prior to enactment of the 1984 Act, foreignmarket value was determined at the time of exportation of the merchandise.Section 615 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 amended section 773(a)(1)of the Act to provide that foreign market value is to be determined asof the date the merchandise is first sold in the United States to an unrelatedpurchaser. Accordingly, in comparing foreign market value with exporter'ssales price, the foreign market value is to be determined as of the timethe goods are sold in the United States to an unrelated purchaser ratherthan at the time of exportation of the goods to the United States. If the Department in exporter's sales price transactions followed section615, but converted currencies, as the comment suggests, on the date ofexportation to the United States, anomalous results would follow. First,the agency would have to determine foreign market value as of the datethe importer resold the merchandise to the first unrelated purchaser. Then,it would have to convert the currency based on exchange rates in effectat the time of exportation, possibly months or even calendar quarters beforethe transactions that form the basis of the foreign market value. The lawwas changed in 1984, however, just so exporter's sales price transactionswould be matched to home market or third country sales on the date of saleto an unrelated purchaser in the United States. Therefore, to convert thecurrency on a date that has no relation to the date of sale would leadto illogical results and otherwise render the 1984 amendment nugatory.<T3>Washington Red Raspberry Comm'n v. United States, </T3>Nos. 88-1076,88-1107, Slip Op. at 14-16 (Fed. Cir., October 13, 1988). The party's reliance on 31 U.S.C. 5151 is also misplaced. Section 5151governs currency conversion; it does not define foreign market value orspecify the date as of which foreign market value is to be determined.To give effect to the commenter's interpretation of 19 U.S.C. 1677b(a)(1)and 31 U.S.C. 5151 would lead to an absurd result.
