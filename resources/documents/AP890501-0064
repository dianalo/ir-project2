RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear a Bushadministration appeal aimed at allowing the government to collectpotentially hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes frommultinational corporations.   In a case involving Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., the court saidit will review a ruling that allows multinationals to use foreigntax laws to reduce their U.S. taxes.   The case stems from operations of Goodyear's British subsidiaryin the early 1970s.   The Ohio-based corporation's subsidiary incurred net losses in1972 and 1973 _ at least under British tax law. The subsidiary's1973 loss included British tax deductions that were not allowedunder American tax law.   As a result, the British government refunded to the subsidiarythe tax payments it made there for 1970 and 1971.   The refunds prompted the U.S. Internal Revenue Service torecompute the taxes it said Goodyear owed in this country.   Multinationals are entitled to claim a share of taxes paid bysubsidiaries overseas as credits against U.S. taxes.   In the Goodyear case, since American law did not recognize the1973 deductions permitted the company in Great Britain thecorporation's loss was converted into a profit.   The redetermination had the further effect of wiping out, forU.S. tax purposes, the foreign tax credits previously allowed in1970 and 1971.   As a result, the IRS assessed Goodyear $791,240 in taxes andinterest for 1970 and 1971.   Goodyear then sued in the U.S. Claims Court, saying the IRSerred in applying American law instead of British law to determinethe company's accumulated profits.   The claims court ruled against Goodyear. But a federal appealscourt here reversed the decision last August.   The appeals court said a multinational company is entitled touse a foreign nation's tax laws to determine accumulated profitsmade by a subsidiary in that country.   Administration officials said the ruling could have ``enormousimportance'' for U.S. tax revenues.   Justice Department lawyers, in the appeal acted on today, saidmore than 25,000 foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies are doingbusiness in more than 100 countries. The government said its mostrecent figures show the companies claimed more than $9 billion inforeign tax credits in 1982.   The IRS is reviewing $150 million in claimed refunds in suchcases and expects the appeals court ruling will prompt anadditional $750 million in refund claims.   The government appeal conceded that the impact of the appealscourt ruling has been blunted by a 1986 change in U.S. tax law thatmay mean multinationals no longer will be able to use a foreigncountry's calculation of its accumulated profits for most futuretax payments here.   The case is U.S. vs. Goodyear, 88-1474.</TEXT></DOC>
