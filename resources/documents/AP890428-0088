The blinding and its source have been known since 1980, but theU.S. government classified the data as secret until last August,scientists said in a series of five articles in Science magazine.   The U.S. Solar Maximum Mission satellite was launched Feb. 14,1980, to investigate, among other things, naturally occurring gammarays in cosmic rays. Its instruments are being blinded, sometimeseight times a day, by gamma rays from the Soviet satellitereactors, the scientists said.   The blinding means that much of the data sought by the U.S.satellite could not be gathered.   The Soviet Union has used nuclear reactors aboard more than 30satellites since the 1960s to provide electricity to power radarssurveying the oceans for movements of U.S. and other warships.   To save weight, space satellites shield only their own equipmentfrom the reactor. The earth's atmosphere prevents any radiationfrom reaching the ground.   Much of the radiation in question is gamma rays. These arephotons produced in nuclear fission more powerful by far than lightrays or X-rays.   Extremely energetic gamma rays also occur naturally in cosmicrays, through processes that astronomers do not yet understand, andin solar flares. Supernovae, quasars and neutron stars are thoughtto be sources.   Though reactor-produced gamma rays interfered with the U.S.satellite instruments, the main radiation affecting the satellitewas electrons and positrons _ positively charged electrons _ fromthe reactor. These charged particles can be trapped for severalminutes by the earth's magnetic field, and positrons colliding withordinary matter in the astronomy satellite are annihilated to yieldmore gamma rays.   ``The data storage capacity of (the satellite instrument) wassaturated by such (positron-gamma ray) signals an average of eighttimes a day for much of 1987 and 1988, and it was effectivelyblinded for the rest of each orbit until the data could betransmitted to the ground,'' wrote Joel R. Primack, a professor atthe Institute for Particle Physics at the University of Californiaat Santa Cruz, in n overview article.   A balloon-carried instrument over Australia in April 1988launched by a team from the University of California at Riversidewas immune from the electron-positron radiation because of its lowaltitude, about 22 miles.   ``The flux we detected from the nearest reactor exceeded by 50times the flux expected from the strongest celestial sources,''wrote the Riverside team.   The team estimated that it could detect such a reactor in anorbit as high as 1,500 miles.   Satellites could turn off their instruments when passing throughvulnerable zones, Primack wrote. ``But if many powerful reactorsare in orbit, as contemplated for advanced stages of (Star Wars),this approach would probably be inadequate to protect gamma-rayastronomy in low earth orbit,'' he said.   Most of the Soviet satellites are in orbits only about 160 mileshigh, where traces of the atmosphere would make them fall to earthafter a few months. The Soviet craft are boosted to permanentorbits nearly 900 miles high after a few months use. It was thefailure of this boosting system that led to the crash of the Cosmos954 satellite in Canada in 1978 and the 1983 crash of the Cosmos1402 in the South Atlantic in 1983.   President Carter proposed to ban reactors in space after the1978 accident, but the Soviet Union refused. Primack suggested thatnow was a good time to renew the proposal.</TEXT></DOC>
