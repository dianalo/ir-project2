(capsule software reviews)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Bobker, Steven.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Bobker's DozenandM;1 Authenticate and MutateandM;Two of the more useful HyperTalk extensions I've seen recently areAuthenticate and Mutate.andM;Authenticate is an XFCN that can check or validate the contents of any field,using programmer-specified criteria, before the data is written to disk.andP;  Theprogrammer also dictates error response.andP;  The checking procedure is UNIX-likepattern matching, and it definitely helps if you're already familiar withthis type of procedure.andP;  The brief manual adequately explains how to set upand use Authenticate.andM;Mutate contains several XFCNs for formatting text fields.andP;  It is not asuseful as Authenticate, but it does help create more-attractive products.andO;Mutate's functions can even be chained to produce complex transformations.andO;It translates numeric monetary values into spelled-out numbers, formats anytext according to a preset pattern (Social Security numbers, for example),translates to equivalent text with a lookup table, pads text with leading ortrailing spaces, and truncates or trims text to a preset length.andM;Authenticate and Mutate are useful but not cheap.andP;  Although their performanceis excellent, both require a reasonable amount of programming skill.andP;  Thepackage also includes versions of the code that can be used with 4thDimension.andM;2 FetchITandM;The most recent Get File and Put File Standard-File-dialog-box enhancer I'vecome across is FetchIT 2.01.andP;  FetchIT adds a pop-up menu on the right side ofthe small-icon and disk-name dialog boxes.andP;  The first item on the menu movesyou up a level in the file hierarchy (just as clicking on the name does whenyou don't have FetchIT installed).andP;  The next item presents a submenu list ofall mounted drives and lets you move to any of them.andP;  The next commandcreates a new folder.andM;The best part of FetchIT is the Look'fer command, which searches the text inall files (open and closed) of a specified directory for a user-specifiedstring or strings.andP;  Multiple-string searches can use simple Booleans, andcase sensitivity can be toggled on and off.andM;The menu concludes with the Find (filenames), Get Info, and Utilitiescommands.andP;  The utilities include file deleting, renaming, and duplicating.andM;Overall performance is superb; I've found no conflicts with any of my INITs.andM;3 ParaFontandM;When your laser fonts don't include all the characters you want, ParaFont canadd these missing characters or even change whole fonts to suit your needs.andO;It's particularly good at creating fractions.andM;ParaFont works on any laser font (Type 1 or Type 3), but its output is a Type3 font.andP;  You'll also need to keep the original base font around when using aParaFont font on a PostScript printer.andM;If you use ATM with ParaFont, you can easily build large screen fonts for usewith non-PostScript printers.andP;  However, ATM requires Type 1 fonts for output,so you'll have to convert ParaFont's fonts, using a third-party conversionutility (such as Altsys' Metamorphosis), for them to work with ATM's.andM;ParaFont behaves well and is quick and easy to use.andM;4 PrintBarandM;The most basic bar codes, such as the UPC (Universal Product Code) and itscousin, the EAN (European Article Number), follow rigid formats and includecalculated check digits.andP;  Just having a bar-code font isn't enough forcreating correct UPC or EAN codes.andP;  Someone, or some program, must calculatethe check digit and add the necessary left, center, and right marks andguides.andP;  PrintBar does that and does it well.andM;PrintBar also supports the other common bar codes, Interleaved 2 of 5 andCode 39, which have broader and more general uses.andM;Using PrintBar is quite simple.andP;  You type or paste in the values or text youwant coded, and the program prints out the correct bar codes.andP;  The threevolumes print different codes and are optimized for different printers.andP;  BothImageWriters and LaserWriters (PostScript and non-PostScript) are supported,as are Linotronic high-resolution PostScript typesetters.andP;  Volume 1 coversCode 39; volume 2 covers UPC-A, UPC-E, and EAN;andM;5 InspirationandM;My comments on Inspiration in the December '89 Bobker's Dozen (page 302) drewquite a few dissenting letters.andP;  My BBS reading also made it clear that asubstantial group of fanatic users has adopted Inspiration.andP;  Thus, I decidedto take another look at it.andM;This time, I looked at Inspiration 2.02 (versus 2.0 in December).andP;  Theprinting-speed problems have been cleared up, although I still find theoutput unattractive.andM;When it is viewed primarily as a brainstorming tool, Inspiration shinesbrighter.andP;  Iths easy to capture the results of a brainstorming session, andafterward, you can manipulate and organize all the ideas you have generated.andM;If you frequently do unstructured brainstorming, take a good look atInspiration [or IdeaFisher or MindLink, reviewed in May '90, page 67--Ed.].andM;6 MacTableandM;The new version of the MacTable desk is stronger and easier to assemble thanits predecessor.andP;  It also takes up slightly less floor space withoutshrinking the working area.andM;The tan wood and gray laminate design is very attractive.andP;  It has fourseparate surfaces that can be configured to handle any Mac or peripheral.andO;Users of Pluses, SEs, SE/30s, and single-page portrait monitors can put theirunits in a back-sloping recess to improve the screen angle.andP;  You can alsoslope the keyboard area for safer and more comfortable use.andM;This version of the MacTable was considerably easier to assemble than theoriginal -- the whole project took only about a half hour.andP;  A variety ofaccessories is available, including a roll-about storage unit that eitherstores under the MacTable or can be used separately as a printer stand.andM;7 Dimensions, Dimensions 2, Natural ImagesandM;These three packages contain large, complex EPSF (Encapsulated PostScriptFormat) files designed for use as backgrounds or design elements.andP;  TheDimensions series contains abstract and rhythmic designs; Natural Imagesdraws on shapes from nature.andP;  The files are big: Dimensions comes on threedisks and has ten designs.andP;  There are two variations of each design, eitherhigh and low contrast or light and dark.andP;  Dimensions 2 comes on four disksand has ten more designs (two more variants of each).andP;  Natural Images comeson five disks!andP;  It too has ten designs, each in two forms.andM;The files are easy to use as long as you have sufficient RAM -- a full-pagefile can take up several hundred K.andP;  The manuals provide good, helpfulinformation on using the files.andP;  They include design examples and tips onmodifying the actual artwork.andM;I can't imagine a serious desktop publisher passing these packages up.andM;8 ShanghaiandM;The new Shanghai 2.0 isn't merely a set of cosmetic changes to a hoaryclassic game.andP;  It adds the cosmetic upgrade -- and a lot ofplayability-enhancing intelligence.andM;You'll see the most obvious enhancement only if you have a color orgray-scale monitor.andP;  On such monitors, the playing area automaticallyenlarges to the size of the screen and the tiles appear in full color (up to256 colors) or shades of gray.andP;  The color is spectacular.andM;The other new features are available to everyone.andP;  Sounds and music have beenadded to all aspects of the game.andP;  There's no copy protection.andP;  Shadows makeit much easier to see buried tiles.andP;  And, most important, the game knows whenyou've run out of moves and tells you so.andM;There's no upgrade path from the previous versions, but the price is so lowthat you shouldn't hesitate to pick up a copy of Shanghai 2.0.andM;9 SuperLaserSpoolandM;One of the most damaging criticisms of HP's superb DeskWriter printer (seeBobker's Dozen, April '90, page 39) was its failure to work with any printspoolers.andP;  SuperLaserSpool 2.02 (see the MacUser LAbs Brief &quot;Print Spoolers,&quot;April '90, page 223) provides excellent DeskWriter support.andP;  Documents spoolrapidly, and the Mac operates smoothly except for the first few files (whenthe print file is apparently being created).andP;  I had no trouble writing thispiece while simultaneously printing another article and also downloading afile (under MultiFinder) from the MacUser Download Area on CompuServe (GOMACUSER).andM;10 DisKeeperandM;DisKeeper, a shareware application, produces a report that, in its most basicform, lists all your files and tells you if there are duplicate, locked, orinvisible files anywhere.andP;  It also reports empty files and application andINIT version numbers, and it indicates whether or not there are any orphans(files whose creator application can't be found).andP;  Locked, invisible, empty,and single-item folders are listed.andP;  You can select just what you want tolook for, with pop-up option menus.andM;All the details are reported in a large text file.andP;  Files can be moved fromwithin DisKeeper--as it's working--to a special Trash folder for eventualdisposal.andP;  DisKeeper can handle up to 10,000 files, 3,000 folders, and 99volumes.andM;11 Model-It!andM;Model-It! is a good tool for mathematical modeling or simulating small and/orsimple dynamic systems.andP;  You build your models visually with blocks that areeasy to create and define.andP;  Output can be visually presented in graph form,or you can see the numerical data that drives the visual output.andP;  You canalso elect to see the output and data in different windows at the same time.andM;Model-It! helps you see how things run, but you need to already have theknowledge to build the correct model in the first place.andP;  The manual, whichis clear and quite good, is emphatic on that last point.andM;Performance is reasonable but nothing to write home about.andP;  Input facilitiesare adequate; output is pretty barebones.andP;  Very large models degradeperformance noticeably.andP;  Still, many engineers and scientists will be able toget a lot of value from Model-It!andM;12 MacInfoandM;MacInfo is a good attempt at solving the Mac bibliographic &quot;Where Is it?&quot;andO;problem.andP;  It's a subscription service that provides a monthly bibliography,in database from, on a disk.andP;  The database is in EndNote (another Niles andAssociates product) format, and Niles offers EndNote to subscribers at areduced price.andP;  It's not the greatest format for this sort of index--thereare no abstracts--but it works.andM;The first volume contained more than 2,800 entries from Mac publicationsbetween February 1989 and the end of the year.andP;  Each monthly update, whichcan be combined with your existing database, promises at least 300 newreferences.andP;  The copies I've received back up that claim.andP;  MacInfor becomesmore useful each month.andM;13 QuickShotandM;This month's screen-capture candidate is QuickShot.andP;  It has two components:an Fkey, which is used to start the actual capture, and a DA, which sets thedetails of the capture.andP;  QuickShot works in all varieties of color, including32-bit.andP;  It also claims to work under A/UX.andM;You can send captures to your printer, a disk, or the Clip-board, and set theprogram to capture the whole screen (main one only), a user-selected area ofthe main screen, or the active window.andP;  Menus can be shown if desired filesare saved in either MacPaint or PICT/PICT2 format.andP;  You can even add basicSystem information to the capture.andP;  Add the time and date, and eliminate thecorner marks that most capture programs catch.andP;  Performance is generallyexcellent.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
