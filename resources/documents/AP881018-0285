The manufacturers already were losing money in sales because achain of stores refused to stock their products and othersthreatened to follow suit.   The lawsuit was filed, and some products removed, after themanufacturers failed to comply with Proposition 65, a toxinsinitiative passed by California voters in 1986.   The initiative requires businesses to provide ``clear andreasonable'' warnings to consumers exposed to chemicals known tocause cancer or birth defects.   ``The tobacco manufacturers were very eager to settle and do theright thing,'' said Duane Peterson, a spokesman for state AttorneyGeneral John Van de Kamp.   The manufacturers made the decision Monday. But on Tuesday,cigars and pipe tobacco were still absent from the shelves of Vonssupermarkets, the 345-market statewide chain that became the firstsupermarket company to announce it would pull the products from itshelves.   ``The shelves are still empty; Vons has not seen a copy of theagreement,'' said spokeswoman Vickie Sanders. She said the grocerycompany would withhold comment on the agreement until it had beenreviewed.   Under the settlement, companies will begin placing warninglabels on cigars and pipe tobacco. The state has agreed to waivethe fines of $2,500 a day it had threatened to place on every packof cigars or other tobacco products that did not contain suchwarnings.   Since passage of Proposition 65, there have been several courtfights over which substances should be classified as toxic.Cigarettes, chewing tobacco and snuff all carry federally mandatedwarnings.   ``We want to make it clear that we have been in compliance (withfederal warning laws) for a year and a half. We are not part of thelawsuit,'' said Chris Close, a spokesman for the Smokeless TobaccoInstitute in Washington.   The institute represents makers of snuff and chewing tobacco.Close said the state Health and Welfare agency said in a July 1letter that the warnings on snuff and chewing tobacco ``areconsistent with the spirit and intended effect'' of Proposition 65.   ``Although labeling is burdensome, the manufacturers preferredto avoid lengthy and costly litigation,'' Norman Sharp, presidentof the Washington-based Cigar Association, said in a statement.   Most cigar products sold nationally will bear the Californiawarning because it would be impossible to label only those sold inCalifornia, Sharp said.   The lawsuit, filed Sept. 30, prompted at least eight retailersand 25 tobacco companies to agree to the warnings.   Van de Kamp filed the lawsuit about two months afterenvironmental groups said they would seek $1.3 billion in finesfrom stores and manufacturers for violating the Proposition 65warning requirement.   After Vons announcement of Oct. 4, Lucky Stores, with 343markets across the state, followed by giving tobacco makers 30 daysto label their products or have them removed from Lucky's stores.   Safeway Stores Inc., which operates 221 stores in California,has posted its own warning signs near cigar, pipe and chewingtobacco displays. The company also told tobacco manufacturers thatit would no longer accept shipments of products without labelsafter Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
