The long-simmering opposition to the 30 French and Belgianmercenaries boiled over after President Ahmed Abdallah Abderrahmanewas assassinated Nov. 26.   Virtually all Comorans blame the mercenary-led PresidentialGuard, the main security force on the nation of four islands in theIndian Ocean.   A protest Saturday in Moroni, the capital, was the second inthree days broken up with tear gas by the 600-strong guard, headedby Frenchman Bob Denard, a legendary soldier of fortune and veteranof countless battles throughout Africa and Asia.   ``The people will not be satisfied until the mercenariesleave,'' said a businessman who asked to be identified only asAbdou. ``The Comorans want to choose their own leader.''   Interim President Said Mohamed Djohar, in a radio announcementFriday, told people not to hold public gatherings.   According to a source in contact with Djohar, the presidentfeels he is hostage to the guard. All his public statements must becleared by the mercenaries, said the source, who requestedanonymity.   The island nation's 450,000 citizens are mostly illiterate,exceedingly poor and politically unorganized, and they likely willfind it difficult to oust the mercenaries by themselves.   The French and South Africans, the two largest aid donors to theislands, suspended all assistance last week and are pressuringDenard and his colleagues to leave.   France has sent troops to its Indian Ocean island of Reunion,but says it is preparing for possible evacuation of French citizensfrom the Comoros, not military intervention.   The French and the South Africans have done the most to entrenchDenard's mercenaries through the strange history of the Comoros.   The islands declared their independence from France in 1975 andAbdallah became president. Within a month, Denard helped engineer acoup that put Ali Soilih in power.   One of Soilih's first acts was to publicly burn all colonialbureaucratic records. He fired the 3,000-member civil service andreplaced it with illiterate teen-agers. He also tried to ban Moslempractices in a nation where mosques are the most prominentstructures in villages of simple grass huts.   Soilih once dreamed he would be attacked by a man with a dog,and his teen-age civil servants tried to carry out his order tokill every dog on the islands.   In 1978, Comoran exiles and the French gave their blessing toanother coup by Denard, who took a boatload of 50 mercenaries andhis pet German shepherd and captured the country in a few hourswhile Soilih slept.   Abdallah was restored to power and Soilih was shot dead twoweeks later, purportedly while trying to escape.   Denard, now 60, initially was greeted as a liberator hero anddecided to remain. He has become a citizen, converted to Islam andmarried his sixth wife, a Comoran less than half his age.   Denard and other mercenaries have become extremely wealthy andhave extensive business interests. For example, the U.S. Embassybuilding is owned by former mercenary Roger Ghys.   Denard began developing ties with South Africa in the early1980s.   South Africa has given the Comoros about $5 million in annualaid and about half went to the Presidential Guard, sources said.   Shortly before Abdallah's death, South Africa told the Comorosit was ceasing aid for the guard, and Denard and Abdallah arguedover funding to the force, according to sources.   Denard has said he was not involved in Abdallah's death and hasno plans to leave. Last week, he arrived at Moroni's main mosqueand sought to swear his innocence before senior religious leaders.   They refused to enter with Denard. More than 1,000 men in thesquare chanted, ``Assassin! Assassin!'' when he emerged afterward.   No one has been arrested in Abdallah's assassination, and thegovernment has said only that ``uncontrolled elements'' wereresponsible.   The 500-man army has been disbanded and the military-style guardpatrols the increasingly empty streets in jeeps mounted withmachine guns.   The Comoros' anemic economy is dependent on foreign aid andcertain to suffer without it.   The nation has virtually no manufacturing and is known primarilyfor their ylang-ylang, a greenish-yellow flower exported for use inFrench perfumes.   ``We want the French to help force the mercenaries out,'' saidan opposition figure who requested anonymity. ``The mercenariescame from there and that's where they should go back.''</TEXT></DOC>
