<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-75-0579 </DOCNO><TEXT>The most unstable current-driven resistive modes of an axially boundedcoronal loop are found in computer simulations to exhibit the spatialstructure of ballooning modes. The observed modes are not confined tomode rational surfaces, but instead have broad radial extent. A theoryassuming ballooning mode spatial structure predicts that a minimum currentshould be required for linear instability, and that, when the mode isunstable, the linear growth rate scales linearly with the resistivityeta below a critical resistivity, and scales as cu root of eta for largerresistivities. Both predictions are borne out by simulation results.Both theory and simulation analyses of the mode suggest that the strongradial structure of the mode near the ends of the system is the primarycontributing factor to the instability of the mode. A helical currentsheet is formed in the nonlinear evolution of the mode near the edgeof the current channel and is accompanied by a strong radial gradientin the current and partial current reversal. 17 references.</TEXT></DOC>
