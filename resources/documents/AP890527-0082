(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cosmos 2021 became Object No.20,000 in the U.S. Space Command's space catalog this week.   The Soviet satellite was logged into the catalog at 5:30 a.m.Wednesday, the time of its launch.   The Space Command's Surveillance Center is tracking about 7,000manufactured space objects, but has cataloged every satellite orpiece of junk larger than a softball in Earth orbit since Sputnikwas launched on Oct. 4, 1957.   The center has tracked a wrench and camera dropped byastronauts, bits and pieces of exploded rocket bodies, satellitesand shuttles.   Most of the 13,000 objects that have fallen back toward Earthburned up in the atmosphere.   But a few more notable objects, such as the U.S.-built Skylaband the Soviet-built Cosmos 954, were too large to burn up and camecrashing back to Earth. Cosmos 954 and its nuclear reactor fell innorthern Canada in January 1978; Skylab fell in Australia and theIndian Ocean in July 1979.   The Space Surveillance Center uses radar and optical trackingdevices to keep track of the objects.   The information is used to ensure that the shuttle or otherrockets depositing payloads in space don't run into objects inorbit, or that a falling satellite isn't mistaken for a missileattack.</TEXT></DOC>
