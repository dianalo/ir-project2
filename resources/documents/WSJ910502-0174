The broker, Mark Malenfant of Scottsdale, Ariz., andThomas Payne, president of his own public-relations firm inPompano Beach, Fla., were charged with fraud and stockmanipulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Afederal court in New York granted the agency's request for arestraining order freezing the proceeds from any sale ofshares in Texscan, an El Paso, Texas, cable-TV productsmaker. The SEC also seeks disgorgement of any illegal profit.</LP><TEXT>   The two men also were indicted by a federal grand jury inNew York for conspiracy to violate securities laws andconspiracy to obstruct SEC proceedings.   Attorneys for the two men said their clients would defendthemselves against the criminal charges. Mr. Payne's attorneysaid his client would deny the SEC's allegations as well ascharges in the indictment. But Mr. Malenfant's attorney saidhis client hopes to settle the SEC charges by a standardagreement under which he neither admits nor denieswrongdoing.   Late last month, the SEC suspended American Stock Exchangetrading in Texscan for 10 days because it became suspiciousabout a manipulation scheme. The SEC lifted the suspensionyesterday. The stock will resume trading this morning.   The SEC charged that in mid-April Mr. Payne contacted NewYork money manager Talton Embry, whose clients at MagtenAsset Management Corp. held about 35% of Texscan shares. Mr.Payne told Mr. Embry, who wasn't charged and cooperated withthe SEC, that he could arrange the sale of Texscan sharesheld by Mr. Embry's clients so as to drive up the price ofthe stock, the SEC said. Two days later, Mr. Malenfant, whoworks for Biltmore Equities andamp; Securities Ltd., told Mr. Embrythat he would place orders to sell the Embry clients' sharesand that Mr. Payne would place matching buy orders, it said.   About the same time, the SEC charged, employees of Mr.Payne's firm, Payne Financial Group, began calling brokers toaggressively promote Texscan shares. But Mr. Embry never soldany shares to the two men, the SEC said.</TEXT></DOC>
