Rep. Leon E. Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House BudgetCommittee, said the hour-long breakfast session at the White Housedealt more with process than with details of the $1.16 trillionspending plan.   ``It was important for us to emphasize we're on the right track.And we are,'' Panetta told reporters after the meeting.   But, he added. ``When does he (Bush) start to make the toughchoices? That's part of the process here, to find out what thechoices are.''   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said the meeting``was not a discussion about details'' but an effort ``to discusshow we might proceed in the future, to discuss the process.''   The session included Democratic and Republican leaders from bothhouses as well as heads of the congressional budget, appropriationsand tax-writing committees.   Seated at the center of one side of the long rectangular table inthe Cabinet Room, the president refused to answer reporters'questions during a brief photo-taking session.   Bush has vowed to be an active player in shaping spending cutsneeded to get the government's annual budget deficit under the $100billion required by law for the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1.   Congress faces an April 15 deadline for completion of its versionof the budget.   Bush's participation in the budget-writing process is unusual inthat it comes less than two weeks after he submitted his proposed$1.16 trillion spending plan, before any votes on spending decisionshave been held by committees in either chamber.   ``It's a ratcheting-up of the process,'' presidential PressSecretary Marlin Fitzwater said in advance of today's meeting.   ``Its purpose is to keep the momentum going,'' said Fitzwater,noting that it was Bush's first meeting with congressional leaderssince the president's address to a joint House-Senate session nearlytwo weeks ago.   Fitzwater said Bush hopes discussions will continue during hisabsence, but that talk has not yet reached the negotiating stage.``I'd say it's in the consultation and discussion stage,'' he said.   White House budget director Richard Darman, meanwhile, opened twodays of testimony before the Senate and House budget committees witha defense of Bush's spending plan as realistic. Leaving the detailsof spending cuts for future negotiations was acknowledging wherethose decisions would be made, he said.   But Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee said they saw it asa political ploy.   ``I just don't see this as a serious initiative,'' said Sen.Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C. ``Where are the cuts going to comefrom?'' said committee chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn. ``We just don'tknow from looking at the Bush budget.   Democrats say Bush listed politically popular initiatives onchild care, education, and homelessness but did not list theapproximately $10 billion in cuts that must be made in otherprograms to pay for the increases _ leaving those unpopular choicesto share with Congress.   Fitzwater counters that ``some 800 pages of details'' have beenmade available to Congress in addition to the 193-page budgetdocument that Bush submitted on Feb. 9.   ``They contain a number of policy options,'' he said, ``but notnecessarily specific cuts. ... A number of various options.''   When pressed Monday to say whether Bush had recommended budgetreductions in specific areas, Fitzwater replied, ``cuts that thegroup might consider.''   Indeed, papers obtained by The Associated Press show theadministration avoided in those documents putting its stamp on anyparticular set of cuts. Options listed included adoption of formerPresident Reagan's budget choices, or freezing programs at lastyear's levels without allowing for inflation.   Blank spaces were left for final decisions, presumably to beworked out in negotiations with Congress.   The documents also suggest that the definition of a ``flexiblefreeze'' is itself flexible and still being developed.   The Bush budget released Feb. 9 defined the freeze as a packageof $136 billion in domestic programs held at this year's spendinglevels, without inflation. Some of those could be increased, butonly if others were decreased to keep the total the same.   The papers sent to Congress last week showed the $136 billionincluded a small piece of the defense budget, about $6 billion,earmarked for programs such as atomic research.   Bush made three out-of-town speeches on his fiscal 1990 budgetproposal last week, capping the appearances with a declaration inSt. Louis last Friday that he wanted ``a quick and early resolutionto the budget crisis.''   ``I am committed to working closely with my friends on the Hillto help them meet the target date set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollingslaw for an April 15 budget resolution,'' he said.   That law, which requires a balanced budget by 1993, calls for adeficit in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 of no more than $100billion _ down from an estimated $160 billion this year. Failure byCongress and the administration to meet that target could result inautomatic across-the-board cuts.   In the proposal he submitted, which was intended to amend thefiscal 1990 budget offered by Reagan in January, Bush said he wantedto increase spending in a number of social areas.   But Democrats have been pushing him to spell out where he wouldmake $10 billion to $11 billion in necessary cuts to pay for theemphasis he wants to give certain programs, especially in view ofBush's no-tax-increase pledge.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine suggested Mondaythat Democrats will have their own agenda.   Talking to reporters covering the AFL-CIO executive councilmeeting in Bal Harbour, Fla., Mitchell said, for example, that itwas his intention to schedule early floor debate on legislation toincrease the minimum wage, which has been frozen at $3.35 an hoursince 1981.   Mitchell said the Democrats' bill would not contain a sub-minimumyouth training wage that Bush has proposed. But the Maine Democratsaid it was possible the bill would be amended on the floor.</TEXT></DOC>
