WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government on Wednesday proposedlegislation that would outlaw surrogate motherhood and geneticengineering and impose restrictions on artificial insemination oflesbians and single women.   West Germany has strict limits on abortion that are beingchallenged by the increasingly left-leaning populace.   Justice Minister Hans Engelhard, who introduced the EmbryoProtection Law at Wednesday's Cabinet session, told reporters itaims to prevent ``the misuse of modern technology, in particularhuman engineering.''   Engelhard said the Embryo Protection Law would make West Germanythe first nation to forbid alteration of the human embryo.   ``Not everything that is technically feasible should in fact cometo pass,'' he said.   Nazi-era attempts at human engineering left an indelible imprinton many Germans, who remain strongly opposed to scientificmanipulation in reproduction.   Engelhard called the practice of human engineering, or scientificselection of sex, physical features and other manipulations of theembryo ``a nightmare.''   While some scientific interference in embryo development could bebeneficial, ``man should not be the last victim of moderntechnology,'' the minister stated.   Referring to surrogate motherhood, Engelhard said the concept ofintentionally producing children for rearing by others contradictsthe 1949 Basic Law governing West German society.   The bill also seeks to prohibit use of public funds forartificial insemination of single women or homosexuals, which wouldlikely force any seeking to bear a child to turn abroad forassistance.   The bill as approved by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's three-partycoalition was scaled back from a more restrictive proposal by theconservative Christian Social Union, which sought a ban onartificial insemination except between married heterosexuals.   Engelhard, a member of the liberal Free Democratic Party but aconservative on reproductive issues, said the law was expected towin parliamentary endorsement.   The opposition Social Democratic Party and the far-left Greenssaid the proposal was inadequate.   Renate Schmidt of the Social Democrats complained that it focusedon limiting reproductive assistance to heterosexuals ``while leavingthe door wide open'' to other forms of population manipulation.   She pointed out that nothing under the proposed bill would deterpeople from selecting sperm donors on the basis of desirablephysical attributes like skin, eye and hair color.   Greens parliamentarian Marie-Luise Schmidt described the proposalas ``piecemeal'' and said her party stood for full renunciation ofreproductive technology and embryo research.</TEXT></DOC>
