REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Khmer Rouge today denouncedVietnam's plan to withdraw troops from Cambodia and called insteadfor a pullout supervised by the United Nations.   Resistance leaders also expressed doubt Vietnam would honor itspledge to remove its remaining 50,000 to 70,000 troops fromCambodia by Sept. 30.   Vietnamese troops entered Cambodia in December 1978 and oustedthe communist Khmer Rouge, under whose rule an estimated one-fourthof Cambodia's 8 million people died from famine and execution since1975.   But the clandestine Khmer Rouge radio, in its first publicstatement on Vietnam's withdrawal plan, said ``the entire Cambodianpeople absolutely cannot accept the announcement of a unilateraltroop pullout of the Hanoi Vietnamese aggressors.''   The broadcast, monitored in Bangkok, also denounced Vietnam'sproposal that India, Canada and Poland oversee the withdrawal alongwith a representative of U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez deCuellar.   Resistance officials oppose Vietnam's choices for the monitoringforce because of Poland's ties to the Soviet Union and India'srecognition of the Vietnam-backed government in Cambodia.   ``Without genuine supervision by the United Nations, there wouldbe no genuine withdrawal of Vietnamese troops,'' the radio said.   China, the main arms suppliers to the Cambodian resistance, alsohas insisted that any monitoring force be established by the UnitedNations and not Vietnam.   The Khmer Rouge is the strongest of the three groups in theresistance coalition headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Fears thatthe Khmer Rouge would regain power has been a major stumbling blockto a settlement of the political crisis brought on by Vietnam'smilitary presence.   On Thursday, Vietnam's official Hanoi Radio reaffirmed that itwould withdraw its troops by Sept. 30 deadline and urged theinternational community to prevent the brutal Khmer Rouge regimefrom regaining power.   Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia has been a major stumblingblock to establishing relations with the United States in the wakeof the Vietnam war and improving economic ties with non-communistSoutheast Asian nations.   China also has refused to resume normal relations with theSoviet Union as long as Vietnamese troops remain. Soviet PresidentMikhail Gorbachev is to visit China next month for the firstChinese-Soviet summit in 30 years.   In the statement, the Khmer Rouge accused Hanoi of announcingthe unilateral withdrawal to avoid U.N. supervision so it couldsecretly maintain troops in Cambodia.   The statement, attributed to Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan,said the move also was aimed at maintaining the pro-VietnameseCambodian administration of Prime Minister Hun Sen.   Resistance groups have called for disbanding the Phnom Penhgovernment and establishing a four-party coalition administrationunder Sihanouk that would include Hun Sen's followers.   The Khmer Rouge, in its statement, also called for thefour-party coalition government.   In a written statement issued Thursday in Beijing, Sihanouk, theformer Cambodian ruler, rejected ``all decisions, all conditions,and all accords'' announced by Vietnam regarding Cambodia.   He urged Vietnam to pull out of Cambodia as soon as possibleunder supervision of the United Nations, which would supervise newelections.   Indonesia, meanwhile, said it would sponsor a meeting betweenSihanouk and Cambodia's Vietnam-backed prime minister, Hun Sen,next month. A spokeswoman for Sihanouk said he planned to meet withHun Sen on May 2 in Jakarta.</TEXT></DOC>
