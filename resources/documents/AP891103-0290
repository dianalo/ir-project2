The aggressive New York investment partnership scored itsbiggest hit in 1987, when the airline's former parent, AllegisCorp., decided to restructure, selling its non-airline businesses,paying a special dividend and buying back its shares more than twoyears ago.   Allegis undertook the restructuring largely because the partners_ Paul E. Tierney, Keith Gollust and Augustus Oliver _ acquired abig block of its shares and threatened to fight for control of theboard of directors to force a breakup of the company.   Coniston pocketed $460 million for themselves and theirwell-heeled clients as a result of the restructuring.   So should not have been necessarily surprising that the triosurfaced Friday with a 9.7 percent stake in takeover target UALCorp., United's current parent, and said it would attempt to takeover the company's board to engineer a profitable takeover orrestructuring.   Historically, however, Coniston has not sought out companiesthat others have already put into play. The trio prefers toidentify undervalued companies, quietly amass enough stock to twistsome arms and then press for changes that will boost the shareprice and the value of Coniston's investment.   The tactic, called ``strategic block investing,'' nettedConiston $44 million when Gillette Co. agreed last year to buy backConiston's 16 million shares after the partners narrowly lost aproxy fight for four seats on the company's board.   Besides Gillette, their successes have included StorerCommunications, where Coniston made about $39 million in a 1985leveraged buyout. The partnership also made a quick $60 million byselling its 12 percent stake in Viacom International when thecompany was acquired by National Amusements in 1987.   This year Coniston went so far out of character as to actuallyacquire one of its targets. In June the partners took over TWServices Inc., which controls thousands of Denny's and Hardee'sfast food restaurants, among others, for $1.65 billion.   But the deal ran into serious difficulties last week when thejunk bond market gave it the cold shoulder. Investors weren'tlining up to buy some $1.15 billion in high-risk junk bonds neededto finance the deal.   Although the restaurants are growing, investors were concernedover how they would fare in a recession. Coniston and itsinvestment bankers were forced back to the drawing board torestructure the terms.   The three partners aren't the only ones to win when Conistonsells out at a profit. Coniston operates a handful of investmentfunds and requires interested parties to put up a minimum $5million to participate.   Last year's estimates pegged the average return at more than 35percent a year and put Coniston's warchest at roughly $700 million.   In addition to making money, the trio has been highly publicizedfor its unconventional, casual style and ability to corral greed.One principal might sport jeans around the office while anotherspends his lunch hour on his 10-speed bicycle racing around nearbyCentral Park.   And unlike the stereotypical investment banker, at least one ofthe partners supported a Democratic presidential candidate, MichaelDukakis.</TEXT></DOC>
