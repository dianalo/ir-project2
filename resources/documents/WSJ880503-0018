Traders said yesterday's steep drop in oil prices -- and the prospect for lower fuel bills in months ahead -- helped several transportation-related issues rise during an otherwise lethargic trading session.    The Nasdaq composite index gained 0.51 point to 379.74. The biggest OTC industrial issues, as measured by the Nasdaq 100 index, rose 1.63 to 353.47, a 0.46% rise. That compares with a 0.54% rise yesterday in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.    Among the broad indexes of OTC stocks, the transportation index's 0.68% gain yesterday was best. The index was up 2.50 to 372.80. Insurance issues did almost as well.    Only 97.8 million shares changed hands on Nasdaq, making it one of the slowest sessions so far this year. There were 966 advancing issues and 1,071 declining ones, though in terms of volume advancing shares were ahead of decliners, 36.2 million to 21.3 million.    Traders continued to fret about the lack of retail business from individual investors. &quot;Institutional (trading) was very busy today,&quot; said Joseph Loftus, a trader on Shearson Lehman Hutton's OTC block desk. But overall action was slow, he said, and will be as long as post-crash publicity about the stock market continues, scaring small investors.    Century Papers was up 3 1/2 to 17 3/4, a 24.5% jump, making it Nasdaq's biggest gainer. National Sanitary announced late Friday it would acquire the small, Houston-based distributor of paper products and sanitary maintenance supplies for $19 a share plus a contingent $2 a share upon satisfaction of certain escrow requirements. National Sanitary said the deal is expected to be completed in the third quarter.    Among the trucking stocks benefiting from the oil price plunge were Roadway Services, the OTC market's biggest trucker with more than $1 billion market value, up 3/4 to 29 3/4; and Yellow Freight System, up 7/8 to 25 3/4. Traders expected some airline issues to rise, too, but the large ones were mostly unchanged.    Western Publishing Group was Nasdaq's busiest stock yesterday, with more than 2.7 million shares changing hands, three times the average. Western closed 3/4 higher at 23, after soaring 7 1/4 Friday on volume of about two million shares.    Much of the action involved traders catching up to Western's announcement Friday that the company was discussing a possible merger with an unidentified company. Trading in Western shares was halted for an hour Friday because of an order imbalance.    A spokesman for New York-based Western, a $475 million market-value company that publishes the Golden Book series for children, yesterday said the company had no additional information to disclose about the merger discussions.    DS Bancor rose 2 1/2 to 23. Rumors circulated that the company may be sold before Joseph Monaco, a real estate developer, and two of his representatives assume board seats Thursday, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. The thrift, which awarded the seats to Mr. Monaco to settle a recent proxy fight, said it isn't in merger talks.    Microcom rose 1 3/4 to 23 1/4 and VLSI Technology gained 3/8 to 8 1/2. Both companies made presentations received favorably at a technology conference sponsored by Hambrecht andamp; Quist. Tyco Toys lost 1 1/4 to 16 after Kidder Peabody lowered its investment rating in reaction to Tyco's recent price advance. </TEXT></DOC>
