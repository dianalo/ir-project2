RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   States may prosecute employers for withholdingaccrued vacation pay owed fired workers, the Supreme Court ruledunanimously today in a case from Massachusetts.   The court said the federal Employee Retirement Income SecurityAct (ERISA) does not pre-empt criminal prosecution in such cases.   ERISA covers employee welfare benefit plans, but accruedvacation pay is more akin to a worker's salary, the court said.   ``Except for the fact that the (vacation) payment has beendeferred, such payments are as much a part of the employees'regular basic compensation as overtime pay or the payment of salarywhile the employee is absent on vacation,'' said Justice John PaulStevens for the court.   The ruling leaves Massachusetts officials free to prosecuteRichard Morash, president of the Yankee Bank for Finance andSavings.   The Yankee Companies Inc. in May 1984 acquired the financiallytroubled Home Savings Bank.   A year later two vice presidents, Christopher Winslow andWilliam Tuttle, were fired. Winslow said the bank owed him $14,520for 66 unused vacation days and Tuttle said he was owed $11,146 for42 unused vacation days.   State prosecutors filed criminal charges against Morash after herefused to pay the money _ except for the vacation days the vicepresidents were owed for the few months they worked in 1985 beforetheir firings.   Morash was accused of violating a state law that appliesspecifically to employers accused of not paying wages to workers,including vacation benefits.   The Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled the law was pre-empted byERISA because the vacation pay was part of the bank's employeebenefit plan. States are barred by ERISA from using criminal lawsto enforce such plans, the state court said.   Law enforcement officials from 12 states joined Massachusetts inurging the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the state court ruling.   The states are Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota,New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Vermont,Wisconsin and Wyoming.   The states said federal law and enforcement mechanisms areinadequate to protect workers wrongfully denied vacation pay.   Stevens said today that criminal prosecution is permitted in thecase of vacation payments owed by a single employer. The situationwould be different if a separate fund was created by a group ofemployers to guarantee vacation benefits to laborers who regularlyshift jobs from one employer to another, he said.   The case is Massachusetts vs. Morash, 88-32.</TEXT></DOC>
