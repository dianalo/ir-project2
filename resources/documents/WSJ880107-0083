Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> F FIN GOVMT </CO><IN> TNM BNK </IN><TEXT>   Ford Motor Co. is nearing an agreement with federal regulators to acquire the nation's largest thrift with massive government assistance, but there remains one major stumbling block that could stop the transaction, industry officials said.    The officials said Ford and the regulators have agreed on most major terms for Ford's acquisition of troubled American Savings andamp; Loan Association, the main unit of Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. of America. Most importantly, they said, agreement has been reached on formulas to determine how much the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. will pay to Ford to cover losses of American Savings over the next 10 years.    The stumbling block, however, is Ford's desire for a guarantee that it will be paid even if the FSLIC is merged into another agency or succeeded by a new agency, the officials said. But it isn't clear how such a guarantee could be structured.    The officials, who declined to be identified, wouldn't specify the formulas for loss-sharing between Ford and the FSLIC. Nor would the officials indicate exactly how the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates thrifts, would transfer control of American Savings to Ford from Financial Corp.    Last year, Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford proposed that the FSLIC absorb 75% to 80% of American Savings' losses, while Ford would absorb the rest and contribute about $1 billion in new capital to American Savings.    Last September, the Bank Board estimated that Ford's proposal would cost the FSLIC $3 billion to $4.5 billion. At the same time, Ford estimated that its proposal would cost the FSLIC about $1.4 billion if interest rates remained stable, but would cost more if rates rise.    The Bank Board said its discussions with Ford about American Savings are continuing, but declined to comment further. Ford officials declined to comment on the current status of the negotiations.    William J. Popejoy, chairman of Financial Corp., declined to comment, saying only that he isn't involved in the talks between Ford and the Bank Board.    The industry officials said that Ford's big thrift unit, First Nationwide Bank, is trying to devise a method of guaranteeing the FSLIC payments that is acceptable to both Ford and the Bank Board. Discussions between Ford and the Bank Board, which were suspended over the Christmas and New Year's holidays, resumed this week, the officials said.    Because the cost of closing or merging several hundred insolvent thrifts is estimated at as much as $50 billion, many thrift executives believe the FSLIC might be merged into the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. or restructured during the next decade. Ford is concerned that in such a merger or restructuring, payments to large companies like Ford might not get the same kind of guarantees that retail depositors would receive.    Another potential problem for Ford is that the FSLIC was declared insolvent last year by its auditor, the government's General Accounting Office. Industry officials have said that it is unclear how Ford's outside auditors would treat promised future payments from the FSLIC in view of the GAO's ruling.    For Ford, the lure of American Savings lies in its network of 184 retail branches, all located in California. Although Ford's First Nationwide unit is based in San Francisco and is the nation's sixth-largest thrift, its California branch network is relatively small, with only 132 of its total of 348 branches. Of those 132 California branches, 71 are kiosks located inside K mart stores.    The troubles of American Savings and Financial Corp. stem from a massive portfolio of delinquent real estate loans and foreclosed property. Since mid-1984, when the Bank Board forced out Charles W. Knapp as Financial Corp.'s chairman, the company has added about $1.4 billion to its loan-loss reserves.    In the first nine months of last year, Financial Corp. had a loss of $243.4 million, largely because of $315.7 million in additions to loan-loss reserves. Last month, the company said it was forced to omit dividends on its preferred stock, partly because of its continuing losses.    The losses have depleted American Savings' capital, putting it in violation of Bank Board rules. As of Sept. 30, American Savings needed $966 million of additional capital to meet Bank Board requirements.    The former chairman of the Bank Board, Edwin J. Gray, issued a letter last Jan. 26 saying that the Bank Board wouldn't take any action against Financial Corp. or American Savings before March 31, 1988, because of the thrift's failure to meet capital requirements.    But it is widely believed in the thrift industry that Mr. Gray's successor, M. Danny Wall, will try to arrange some resolution of American Savings' problems before the letter expires. Mr. Wall himself said early last November at a thrift industry convention in New Orleans that he hoped to resolve Financial Corp.'s problems &quot;soon,&quot; but didn't specify a time frame.    Roger Martin, one of the three other Bank Board members, said at the same convention that he hoped to resolve Financial Corp.'s problems within &quot;one to three months.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
