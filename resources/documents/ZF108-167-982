Center for the Study of Data Processing.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A New Ancient ConflictandM;It looks like a computerized version of an ancient conflict: the craftsmanwants it done right but the boss wants it fast.andM;A total of 604 respondents to a survey on the use of computer-aided softwareengineering (Case) packages were asked which of four benefits--fasterdevelopment, easier maintenance, higher quality or lower cost--was mostimportant.andM;The survey was conducted by the Center for the Study of Data Processing(CSDP) at Washington University in St. Louis.andM;Respondents identifying themselves as &quot;very familiar&quot; with Case rated higherquality and easier maintenance over faster development of applications.andM;MIS directors placed faster development at the top of their Case wish list; afull point higher than high quality on a five-point scale.andM;Thomas Browdy, director of the CSDP's Case Studies Consortium in St. Louis,said the study illustrates a &quot;different mind-set of adoption.andP;  Management islooking for ways to get the job done quicker and reduce the backlog, but thepeople closer to Case are buying into the whole process because of qualityissues.&quot;andM;Significantly, both groups rated lower cost in last place, although thehigh-familiarity group rated it higher (3.7) than MIS directors (3.1).andM;REQUIREMENTS DEFINITIONandM;Browdy said the study also asked about the types of problems associated withCase.andM;&quot;We asked what was their biggest bottleneck or what pieces of the life cycleconstituted a bottleneck.andP;  Requirements definition was number one,&quot; Browdysaid.andM;&quot;In another part of the survey we asked, if they could improve on something,what would it be?andP;  Requirements definition was number one again,&quot; Browdysaid.andP;  &quot;Surprisingly, code generation was very low on the list.&quot;andM;Successful development-center operations were associated with &quot;a perceptionof a smoother systems development process,c according to the report.andP;  Only30% of the organizations reported having a development center, compared with60% reporting the existence of an information center.andM;Other findings include:andM;* less than a quarter of the respondents rated their familiarity with Caseabove a three on a five-point scale--MIS management came in at 17%;andM;* even the most widely used tools--source-code library maintenance, DBMS,electronic mail and fourth-generation languages--are not in standard use inmost companies;andM;* nearly three-fourths of all respondents said strategic planning is the mostcritical issue for the future;andM;* respondents fingered corporate management as the most frequent externalfactor impeding information systems development.andP;  But it was also seen as themost likely to facilitate change in the IS organization;andM;* the three issues most frequently listed as barriers to Case implementation:high cost, the required learning curve and integrating Case tools withexisting software and hardware; andandM;* education was seen as the most important factor in improving IS developmentproductivity.andM;&quot;Education is going to play a more major role in this technology,&quot; Browdysays.andP;  &quot;To use Case, you've got to know what you're doing.andM;&quot;This isn't a matter of apple pie and motherhood, it's a matter of somethingwe can't do until we get educated, until we've sent the staff off to learnstructured methods, to learn the issues of information engineering, so we canapply the structured approach to developing systems,&quot; according to Browdy.andM;Browdy says he detected an irony that arose from the survey.andM;&quot;The people who really know how to build systems--who implicitly know how,who are using the right mental processes to get the job done--are also theones who know the least about the technology and the terminology thatstructured methods use.andP;  They aren't close enough to understand thediscipline of Case--the concepts, yes--but they need to understand theterminology, not just the concepts,&quot; Browdy said.andM;CHOOSING A MIND-SETandM;Organizations that adopt Case decide from one of four distinct mind-sets, heclaims.andP;  &quot;One says, 'We're going to change the building process and make itbetter.'andM;&quot;A second has a strategic mind-set.andP;  You can see their intention of posturingthemselves somehow in the marketplace by way of building their systemsdifferently.andM;&quot;The third is a cultural reason, and it's a shocker to me: to helpreinvigorate the IS staff and to lift their sights beyond what it is now.&quot;andO;Browdy admits that this result may be somewhat skewed because 39% of therespondents were MIS directors.andM;&quot;Fourth, we have the innovators.andP;  They don't know what to do with this stuffbut they're going to try it,c he reports.andM;Browdy says the survey, completed last summer, is the first stage of atwo-stage effort.andP;  Because &quot;relatively little documentation is availableabout how Case products have actually been implemented in MIS environments,&quot;Browdy says he wants to improve the analysis process.andM;Stage-two interviews have begun.andM;The consortium which commisisoned the first stage comprises many well-knowncompanies among Case vendors, such as: Index Technology Corp., Cambridge,Mass.; McDonnell Douglas Corp., St. Louis; Texas Instruments, Plano, Texas;KnowledgeWare Inc., Atlanta; Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass; XASystems Corp., Los Gatos, Calif., and Unisys Corp., Blud Bell, Pa.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
