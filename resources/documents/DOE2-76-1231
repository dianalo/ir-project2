<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-76-1231 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Feed Materials Production Center (FMPC), is a Department of Energy(DOE) facility, that produces high purity uranium for defense programs.It also serves as the DOE's repository for temporary storage of thoriummaterials. The containers storing the thorium materials have sufferedfrom extensive environmental deterioration and with the passing of timerecords have been lost. The net result is that a significant number ofcontainers have lost their identifying markings. The exact type of materialsin some of the containers is unknown. The containers must be repackagedfor Environmental Safety and Health (ESandamp;H) reasons. Prior to repackagingthe identity of the contents must be ascertained. However, these containerscannot be opened due to As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) and ESandamp;Hconsiderations. A method was developed to determine the content of thecontainers, without physical inspection, prior to the repackaging/overpacking.This method utilizes a computer based data base management system whichincorporates statistical analysis of the available input data and assignsstatistical weighting to the various inputs, based on the significanceof the data. The data consists of the following: historical data on thecontainers, if it exists; the weight of the containers and materials;the gamma energies related to the various materials; the geometry ofthe container and materials; the absorption coefficients of the materialsand containers; the self-shielding of the materials; external contaminationdata, if any; and any other data obtained either prior to or during theoverpacking effort. This system will work not only for the thorium materials,but the system has the capability to perform similar functions at otherfacilities faced with similar concerns. 2 refs., 3 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
