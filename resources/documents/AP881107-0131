North was dismissed Monday, without oppositionfrom the prosecution in the Iran-Contra conspiracy case.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell dismissed a charge thatNorth had fabricated documents to hide from investigators the factthat arms dealer Richard V. Secord had paid for the installation ofa $13,800 security fence outside North's home in suburban GreatFalls, Va.   The defense had contended that North could not be charged withobstruction of justice because the alleged fabrication did not occurwhile a grand jury was investigating the Iran-Contra affair.   North was charged with fabricating the documents in December,1986, a month before the special federal grand jury thatinvestigated the case was convened.   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh consented to the dismissalof the charge in a response to the defense motion.   Gesell dismissed the charge, which carried a potential five-yearprison term and a $250,000 fine, noting the ``lack of opposition''from prosecutors.   But the judge denied a defense motion to dismiss a related countcharging North with illegally accepting payment for the installationof the fence. The defense contended that the charge should only betried in federal court across the Potomac River in Virginia.   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and a former NationalSecurity Council aide, is charged with conspiring to defraud thegovernment by illegally diverting U.S.-Iran arms-sale proceeds tothe Nicaraguan rebels.   No date has been set for his trial or those of his fourco-defendants: former national security adviser John M. Poindexter,Secord and arms dealer Albert Hakim.</TEXT></DOC>
