ChairmanWilliam Seidman told bankers that the Bank Insurance Fundneeds a quick infusion of $5 billion to $10 billion.   The FDIC would like to get the money within a few monthsand hopes to use some of it to help banks avoid failure. Theinfusion would be the first part of the $25 billion that theBush administration says is needed for the fund over the nextfive years. After an all-day meeting, the banking industryrepeated its determination to raise the money, although theindustry still hasn't agreed on the details of a fundingplan.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The banking industry is confident that it can provide aprivate-sector solution to the problem of the Bank InsuranceFund,&quot; said Donald Ogilvie, executive vice president of theAmerican Bankers Association, after banking leaders met withMr. Seidman and Treasury Department officials.   At a so-called banking summit held to accelerate industryaction on a refunding plan, Mr. Seidman said the FDICprojects that bank failures are expected to remain high overthe next two years, shrinking the insurance fund to $2.4billion by the end of 1992 from an estimated $3.9 billion atthe end of this year and $9 billion at the end of 1990.   This estimate, the first for next year, assumes no newfunding and a mild recession ending by the middle of thisyear. If the recession continues into next year, the fundwould run out of money by the end of this year and show adeficit of $5.8 billion by the end of 1992, Mr. Seidman saidbefore yesterday's meeting.   In either case, &quot;the banking industry has the capabilityof recapitalizing the fund, and no taxpayer funding isneeded,&quot; Mr. Seidman said.   Banks currently support the fund with an annual premium of19.5 cents on each $100 of domestic deposits. The industry,worried about the financial condition of many of its members,has been working for weeks to find a way to augment the fundwithout a large and rapid increase in premiums.   Both banks and the government are discussingmore-aggressive actions to prevent bank failures and slow thedrain on the fund. The FDIC is studying ways to encouragebank mergers, particularly in New England, and to use loansor capital investments to help banks avoid failure duringtough times. A quick infusion of $5 billion to $10 billionwould give the agency more flexibility to pursue theseoptions. At yesterday's meetings, the industry endorsed theidea of &quot;restructuring marginal banks&quot; in ways that boosttheir capital and financial strength.   Next week, the Bush administration intends to announce anambitious plan to restructure the banking industry, butofficials agree that they must find a way to rebuild the BankInsurance Fund before Congress will consider other changes.It became clear yesterday that central elements of theadministration's plan will face stiff opposition.   At a meeting of the New York State Bankers Association,Federal Reserve Board Gov. John LaWare opposed a Bushadministration proposal that would limit deposit insurance onchecking and savings accounts to $100,000 per person. &quot;Thepublic is going to see this as a take-away, and I thinkthat's dangerous,&quot; he said. He added that the proposal raises&quot;the very serious danger of deposit migration from smallbanks to large banks,&quot; which the public will continue to seeas too big to fail.   Speaking to the same meeting, Gerald Corrigan, presidentof the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said he is &quot;stronglyopposed&quot; to allowing industrial companies to directly orindirectly own and control banks, a change that is expectedto be part of the Treasury Department's plan to overhaul thebanking system.   More broadly, some administration officials said they fearthat the entire Federal Reserve Board, as well as former FedChairman Paul Volcker, could oppose a section of the proposaldealing with banking regulation if the Fed decides it wouldlose too much control over major banks.   On the more immediate issue of bolstering the BankInsurance Fund, some banking officials in Washingtonexpressed hope that the industry might be able to agree on aproposal by next week, although significant details remainunresolved.   The industry might be able to borrow from the Treasury orin the capital markets the $5 billion to $10 billion Mr.Seidman wants quickly. A premium increase of 4.4 cents abovethe current 19.5 cents would amortize over 20 years a $10billion borrowing at an interest rate of 9.2%, according toFDIC calculations.   Raising a total of $25 billion over five years -- theamount the administration says is necessary to coverinsurance fund losses estimated by the Office of Managementand Budget -- would be more difficult. However, Treasuryofficials hinted at the meeting with bankers yesterday thatthe full amount may not have to be raised if new limits ondeposit insurance and early regulatory intervention to reducebank failures slow the drain on the insurance fund. Fulladoption of the Treasury proposals could cut bank failurecosts as much as $8 billion over five years, one officialestimated.   According to the FDIC, in a mild recession 180 banks withtotal assets of $65 billion will fail this year and 160 withassets of $30 billion will fail in 1992. If the recession isworse, the FDIC projects that 230 banks with assets of $90billion will fail this year, followed by 210 failures withassets of $70 billion in 1992.   The rise in bank failures is triggering congressionalconcern about the adequacy of the financial-disclosure rulesfor banks and thrifts. In a letter to financial regulatorsyesterday, Sens. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) and John Heinz(R., Pa.) said the rules &quot;should be reviewed to determinewhether the current system adequately protects investors inthese institutions.&quot; Currently, many banks and thrifts areexempt from filing disclosure documents with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission.   Separately, Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarkecriticized a proposal by SEC Chairman Richard Breeden thatwould force banks to use current values of debt instrumentsheld for investment -- marking them to market -- rather thanbeing allowed to use original cost.   Mr. Clarke warned that the change could &quot;lead bankers toshorten the maturities of their investment portfolios tolessen the standard's impact on earnings and capital&quot; andreduce &quot;the appetite of banks for (U.S. government)securities.&quot;   Moreover, Mr. Clarke said, banks might change their assetbase to avoid securities and other loans that might have tobe marked at current value, in turn affecting earnings,liquidity and asset quality.   &quot;Mark to market does not represent merely a change in bankaccounting,&quot; he said. &quot;It represents a change in bankingpolicy.&quot; He vowed to take a hard look at the issue before anydecision is made to move to that accounting method.   The Financial Accounting Standards Board is reviewing Mr.Breeden's plan and will determine in the next few monthswhether to enact the proposal. The SEC has the final say overaccounting standards.   ---   Kevin G. Salwen in Washington and David B. Hilder in NewYork contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
