Following the extreme rise, however,the oil price then decreased to 26 dollars /bbl by the end of 1985, forcingthe activities for development of substitute energy for oil to becomestagnant in most countries of the world. It cannot be expected that anysubstitute energy for oil will be utilized in great amounts as a majorenergy source unless its price is comparable to or less than that ofexisting energy. The gasification of coal practiced in the Cool WaterPower Plant in the U.S. has not as yet become economically competitivewith combined fuel power generation using natural gas, though the planthas made excellent technological achievements. The development of newenergy may not be an urgent issue in the light of the current situationconcerning the energy supply and demand. It is desirable, however, tomake steady progress toward the next century because it takes much timeto achieve the goal of developing new energy. (3 figs)</TEXT></DOC>
