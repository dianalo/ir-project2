Anders, president and chief operating officer, said.    In the quarter ended July 31, Mr. Anders said in an interview, net rose to an estimated three cents a share. The electronics concern had year-earlier net of $23,000, or one cent a share. Sales are estimated at $3 million for the latest quarter, compared with $2.7 million.    Six-month net fell 39% to about $95,000, or three to four cents a share, from $156,000, or six cents a share, Mr. Anders estimated. Sales fell 5% to $5.9 million from $6.2 million.    The executive said the year-earlier six-month figures reflect a one-time order from Zenith Electronics Corp. that accounted for $1.5 million of sales and five cents a share of the net.    For fiscal 1990, Mr. Anders said, North Hills expects perhaps a 30% to 50% improvement in net from the previous year's $339,821, or 13 cents a share, as sales rise to $13 million from $12 million.    In its second quarter, North Hills Electronics saw &quot;very fine volume pickup&quot; in its businesses, including a 20% rise in orders for products used in local area networks, said Mr. Anders. Such networks are groups of computers that can &quot;talk&quot; to, or share data with, one another.    The company's most important product in local area networking is the balun, which allows a personal computer and a printer and other peripheral items to link up in a network. In addition, what North Hills calls a multistation access unit allows as many as eight personal computers to transfer data to one another. These products provide about 60% of current revenue, the executive said.    The baluns, of which North Hills makes about 80 types, are designed to allow components to &quot;talk&quot; using International Business Machines Corp.'s token-ring method of data transmission. &quot;Our feeling is that token ring will surpass Ethernet,&quot; which is about a 15-year-old system, as a data-transfer standard, Mr. Anders said.    &quot;Interestingly, our interest {in local area networking} is really a result of IBM deciding not to market our products directly,&quot; Mr. Anders said. In 1982, IBM &quot;decided the market for baluns wouldn't be so great&quot; and determined to sell them only through its distributorships, Mr. Anders said.    When IBM decided not to directly market North Hills products, &quot;we were again a small engineering company&quot; and needed to develop more products and an organization to market them, he said.    North Hills had losses in fiscal years 1986 through 1988 as it developed a marketing system. The company has been expanding its customer base, Mr. Anders said, using trade and military-magazine advertising as well as plowing about 27% of sales back into selling and general and administrative expenses to promote its equipment.    The company is aiming at installed personal computers to create networks, Mr. Anders said, estimating that only about 20% of PCs currently are linked. Additionally, while new computers are being produced with one balun built in, a second must be installed in the wiring of the network itself.    North Hills will be introducing several other local area networking products in its fourth quarter. These include fiber-optic and coaxial repeaters and line drivers, which ensure that a signal sent from one computer to another finds its destination despite any interference that might occur on the line. Each of the new products could produce $1 million of revenue during its first year of sale, Mr. Anders estimated.    North Hills derives about 35% of its business from signal-processing products. In this category are data bus couplers used in military aircraft to transmit electronic signals throughout a plane, Mr. Anders said. North Hills sells to Boeing Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp., Grumman Corp., Northrop Corp. and other airplane manufacturers.    Much of this business involves retrofitting existing planes. The operation &quot;isn't susceptible to significant swings in the military budget,&quot; Mr. Anders said. And the company now is looking to Europe as another significant source of revenue.    Also in North Hills' signal-processing product line are video isolation transformers used to clean up interference on closed-circuit TV lines.    The rest of North Hills' operations are in specialty power supplies for industrial applications, including computers systems, and military uses, including tanks and other vehicles. Competition for engineers on Long Island was so severe that the company decided to produce this equipment in Yokneam, near Haifa, in Israel, Mr. Anders said. </TEXT></DOC>
