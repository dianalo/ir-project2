Dwarfing all other government bailouts, the plan approvedWednesday would provide at least $157 billion over the next decade_ most of it from taxpayers _ to close or merge 350 failed thriftinstitutions and make good on government pledges in the rescue of200 others last year.   It would also reorganize the regulatory bureaucracy, provide $50million a year for the Justice Department to pursue fraud in Sandamp;Lsand enact other reforms, chief among them a requirement that thriftowners back their lending with more of their own capital.   The ultimate passage of the bill was never in doubt, but Sen.Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, was threatening to prolong debate,which began Monday, into the weekend unless senators agreed totougher capital requirements.   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the SenateBanking Committee, and Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the panel's seniorRepublican, had been resisting amendments, arguing that the packageput together privately by the committee and endorsed by a 21-0 votelast week was too delicately balanced to withstand many changeswithout crumbling.   But only five minutes before the scheduled start of an 11-dayrecess, Metzenbaum succeeded in wresting concessions that allowedsenators to adopt the bill, 91-8, and leave town until May 1.   The committee's bill had doubled capital standards, requiringSandamp;L owners to come up with $6 for every $100 in lending, comparedwith the current requirement of $3.   However, it provided a big loophole for about a third of thenation's 3,000 Sandamp;Ls by allowing an accounting item known as ``goodwill'' to be counted as capital for the next 25 years. Good willrepresents the value of an institution's customer loyalty and otherintangible assets.   Declaring that ``goodwill isn't worth doodly-doo,'' Metzenbauminsisted that Sandamp;Ls have at least 1.5 percent in ``tangible capital'_ cash, stocks and property that could easily be converted to cashand could be seized, in the event of a failure, before turning togovernment deposit insurance funds.   Metzenbaum had sought 3 percent tangible capital, but in the endhad to accept 1.5 percent. Regulators will have the authority torestrict the growth of institutions falling below that level.   ``I can't say I'm satisfied with the result that has beenobtained. ... I can say substantive progress has been made,''Metzenbaum said.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady praised the bill, saying,``We ... applaud the Senate's efforts to maintain strong capitalrequirements.''   Metzenbaum was urged on by two groups _ Consumer Federation ofAmerica and Consumers Union _ that decided to emphasize capital asan important consumer issue.   ``I never thought he'd get that. ... Everybody is shocked,''said Peggy Miller, a lobbyist for the Consumer Federation. Thegroups are hoping the Metzenbaum victory will lend momentum totheir fight to toughen the House version of the Sandamp;L bill.   The House Banking subcommittee on financial institutions passeda similar 1.5 percent standard last week and Rep. Henry B.Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the full committee, says he will tryto increase that when his panel begins redrafting the legislationnext Wednesday.   He wants the full House to vote by the end of May, sending abill to the president's desk in June following a House-Senateconference.   Another Metzenbaum amendment will require federal regulators toreview last year's Sandamp;L bailouts, possibly renegotiating the dealsto reduce the government's costs.   The Senate also adopted, by voice vote, an amendment from Sen.Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, which would require ailing banks andSandamp;Ls to obtain advance permission from regulators before raisinghigh-cost deposits through money brokers.   On a 61-38 vote, senators rejected an effort by Sen. Bob Graham,D-Fla., to force the top Sandamp;L regulator, Federal Home Loan BankBoard Chairman M. Danny Wall, to undergo reconfirmation by theSenate.   The bill as passed guarantees Wall's job through June 1991.Graham said he faults Wall for underplaying the Sandamp;L crisis in themonths before last year's presidential election.   Riegle lost a fight on how to fund the bailout. The bill createsa new, quasi-public agency, allowing the government to borrow $50billion without counting it toward the budget deficit.   Riegle said taxpayers would have saved $4.5 billion in lowerinterest rates over 30 years if the $50 billion was borrowedthrough the Treasury. However, his plan would have ballooned the1989 budget deficit to within range of the all-time high of $221billion set in 1986.   On passage of the bill by the Senate, all the no votes were castby Democrats: Sens. Max Baucus of Montana, Bill Bradley of NewJersey, Kent Conrad of North Dakota, James Exon of Nebraska, ErnestF. Hollings of South Carolina, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Metzenbaum,and David Pryor of Arkansas. Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., did notvote.</TEXT></DOC>
