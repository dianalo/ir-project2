Perhaps, but the description unfortunately has rung true recently, particularly for what brokers call &quot;swoon stocks.&quot; These are issues that plunge 20% to 50% in one day on the slightest bad news or a negative comment from a single analyst.    Take, for example, American Travellers. The supplemental-health insurer in Warrington, Pa., last Monday saw its stock plunge 26% -- or $1.625, to $4.625 a share. Why? An analyst trimmed his earnings estimate from $1.05 to 95 cents a share for this year, and a similar amount for next year. He also reiterated his long-term bullish view of the stock, but that didn't seem to matter.    &quot;I was shocked&quot; by the stock's plunge, which was the biggest percentage fall on the Nasdaq OTC system that day, says the analyst, Tom Richter of Robinson Humphrey Co. He says the fall shows how &quot;thin and skittish&quot; the market is.    Because of the drop in trading activity from individual investors and the fickleness of institutional players dominating OTC trading now, smaller stocks hit with disappointing news have had no place to hide. One-day plummets of 20% or 30% have become commonplace, even a year after the stock crash; rises of such amounts are much rarer.    &quot;In this environment, it's pretty easy to get the ball rolling. It's very easy to get stocks to go down,&quot; says Richard Bruno, head of OTC trading at PaineWebber Inc., New York.    The OTC market is still &quot;very unforgiving to negative news or news that's not expected,&quot; says William Rothe, OTC trading director at Alex. Brown andamp; Sons, Baltimore.    According to data compiled for The Wall Street Journal, these days more than three times as many OTC stocks are plunging 40% or more over the course of a month than they did in January, when the OTC market was hopping.    Bruce Collins, a quantitative analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., measured prices of 3,300 OTC stocks during the first nine months of the year. In January, about 150 of the stocks fell 25% or more, and 25 of those fell 40% or more. Those numbers ballooned nine months later to 275 falling 25% or more, and 80 falling 40% or more.    Strangely, stocks are tumbling not just on bad news, but even on quite positive earnings announcements. Especially in the current downcast environment, &quot;the anticipation of an event is a whole lot better than the event itself,&quot; explains Mr. Bruno. &quot;Institutional investors figure that if the news is out and nothing positive is happening (with the stock), it's time to sell.&quot;    Kinetic Concepts learned that the hard way. The specialty-bed maker on Nov. 1 reported a 66% increase in third-quarter results. But the stock fell 14%, or $1.25, to $7.625 a share. &quot;Earnings came out slightly shy of what we thought they'd do,&quot; analyst Joy Twiss Thompson of Marshall andamp; Co., Atlanta, explained that day.    Binkley Shorts, portfolio manager of the $300 million Over-The-Counter Securities Fund, says part of the problem is that big institutions were so enthusiastic about surging smaller stocks in the beginning of the year. Now, with smaller stocks stagnating like the rest of the market, &quot;the big guys who were in such a panic to buy them are feeling less of a need. And when there is disappointing news, they say, 'I knew I shouldn't be here anyway. This isn't my turf.'&quot;    For investors stuck with a swoon stock, the advice from OTC analysts is not to automatically panic. If the company is fundamentally sound, the stock price may eventually recover, they say, and a one-day overreaction may even create a good buying opportunity.    OTC brokers also stress that their stocks often outperform listed ones on a long-term basis. And overall, the Nasdaq Composite Index is up 13% this year, twice as much as the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Also, they note, the tiny stocks that generally trade under $3 a share have always taken big percentage moves up or down when they move at all.    However, the year-to-date rise of the overall OTC market is little solace to an investor holding a swoon stock. For example:   --Strategic Planning Associates stock tumbled 28.5%, or $3.50 a share to $8.75, on Nov. 3 after an analyst predicted a 25-cent-a-share quarterly loss for the company. That happened even though the analyst characterized the loss as &quot;a little stumble&quot; that is common for consulting firms.    --Home Intensive Care shares toppled 41% -- down $1.75 to $2.50 -- on Oct. 26 after Medicare slashed reimbursement levels for home kidney-dialysis treatment by 48%. Though it was clearly bad news, the company is vigorously lobbying to restore the payments.    Investors howled, but OTC traders weren't that shocked by such tumbles. They're still talking about the summer's 28.6%, 30% and 22% one-day slides in rapid succession of Apollo Computer, Seagate Technology and Silicon Graphics, all on earnings disappointments.    Of course, the sudden, sharp moves sometimes are up, as well. That's what happened last week when shares of Arabian Shield Development, a small Dallas mining company, soared 45% in a day on rumors that it had received an important ore-processing license from Saudi Arabia. But on a typical day, the super-plungers outnumber the advancers, especially among larger OTC issues.    Is buying a swoon stock just after it swoons really a good investing technique? Often it is, advises Mr. Shorts, the Over-The-Counter Securities Fund manager, who says he's &quot;the classic buyer of swoon stocks.&quot; If a 20% decrease in a stock is only temporary, Mr. Shorts figures, it's a big buying opportunity.    Yet even pros like Mr. Shorts can get trapped by such a technique. Mr. Shorts was snared in one of the OTC market's biggest stock debacles this year: the Regina tumble.    On Sept. 21, when Regina plunged from $17 to $7 on a negative earnings projection, Mr. Shorts believed the company's pronouncement that it was still fundamentally sound, and snapped up shares at $7. Unfortunately, Regina kept issuing progressively worse news, and Mr. Shorts was forced to bail out soon after at $5. The stock currently trades for $5.25.    The usually optimistic Mr. Shorts warns: &quot;I've discovered that there is a tendency for the first piece of bad news to be only the beginning. I've been burned a couple of times.&quot;    ---   A DISCOURAGING WORD: Individual OTC stocks may be good buys, but overall there has been a &quot;technical erosion&quot; of OTC momentum over the past eight months that &quot;can be expected to spread for several more weeks,&quot; writes Christine Callies, a Dean Witter Reynolds senior market analyst, in her OTC Counter Action report.    Ms. Callies says investors shouldn't be fooled by the relative lack of selling pressure in the OTC market and the fact that the Nasdaq Composite Index has slumped &quot;only&quot; 3% from its October high. She says investors should maintain caution: Even though the market might turn up by the end of the year, OTC stocks have a tendency to &quot;accelerate in the final stages of a decline and then turn up more slowly than listed stocks.&quot;    ---   IMAGE POLISHING: The National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs the Nasdaq OTC system, plans an &quot;image-advertising campaign,&quot; partly to dissuade bigger OTC companies from jumping to the New York and American stock exchanges, says NASD President Joseph R. Hardiman.    OTC officials are concerned that more of their stocks have been slipping to the exchanges. Hurt by post-crash jitters about the OTC marketplace and aggressive wooing from the exchanges, Nasdaq will lose close to 2.5% of its companies this year, up from about 2% in prior years, according to Mr. Hardiman.    But aside from Genentech's defection in March and huge but lightly traded Berkshire Hathaway's later this month, &quot;we've been proud of our ability to retain our major companies,&quot; says Mr. Hardiman.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 4.64 to 373.76, a 10-week low. For the month, the index is down 2.3%, compared with a 3.8% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a 4% drop in the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index.    Like the rest of Wall Street, volume in the holiday session was light, at about 109.7 million shares. Decliners beat advancers, 1,391 to 600.    For the week, SafeCard Services was the story among the decliners, with a fall of 2 1/4 to 5 1/4 on heavy volume. Investors fled after news that the big credit-card protection concern's Florida offices were the site of an Internal Revenue Service search last month. The company said it wasn't a target or subject of the IRS.    Among other decliners Friday, Gotaas Larsen Shipping declined 1 to 47 1/2 on news of a takeover agreement at $48 a share and Epsilon Data Management fell 1 1/4 to 8 1/4 because the company will lose an account with Pan American World Airways contributing 17% of Epsilon's revenue in fiscal 1988.    Alco Health Services jumped 1 1/8 to 25 3/8. The company said it received takeover bids.    Takeover speculation boosted Sound Warehouse another 1 1/2 to 20 3/4, as well as Onondaga Savings Bank 1 1/8 to 12 1/2 and SciMed Life Systems 1 3/4 to 27 1/4.    BGS Systems surged 1 to 8 3/4. The software maker declared a special $1 dividend and reported third-quarter earnings of 27 cents a share, compared with six cents a year earlier.    Among Nasdaq's biggest stocks, Intel slipped 3/4 to 24, MCI Communications fell 5/8 to 21 3/8, Nordstrom eased 5/8 to 27 7/8, Tele-Communications Class A fell 3/4 to 24 1/4 and Apple Computer declined 1 to 38 1/2. </TEXT></DOC>
