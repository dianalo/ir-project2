The closely held company isstruggling to stave off bankruptcy-law proceedings.   &quot;This national institution is being revived, this nationalinstitution will be alive and well for the summer of 1990,&quot;Mr. Currey said at a news conference at Greyhoundheadquarters.</LP><TEXT>   He said that Greyhound is serving locations thatcontributed 98% of its pre-strike revenue and that bymid-June route frequency would be the same as last year onall major routes. The executive said the company needs toachieve about 85% of pre-strike revenue to be profitable. Hesaid revenue currently is running at between 65% and 75% ofpre-strike levels.   Because of strike-related first-quarter losses totaling$55.8 million, Greyhound missed a $5 million April 30 leasepayment and won't make a $9.8 million interest payment May 15on its 13% senior notes due in 1995. Because of the missedinterest payment, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. downgraded itsrating on the senior notes to triple-C-minus fromsingle-B-minus.   Hoping to avoid a federal bankruptcy-law filing, thecompany is negotiating with creditors and lenders on a majorfinancial restructuring.   &quot;We expect and we have received cooperation from all theparties concerned,&quot; Mr. Currey said of those talks. He addedthat the company has sufficient cash on hand to continue tooperate its business and to conduct a $4 million summeradvertising campaign. He declined to discuss details.   The Greyhound chairman described the often violenttwo-month-old strike by 9,400 ATU members as &quot;irrelevant&quot;because, he said, the unit of GLI Holding Co. is close tohaving sufficient new drivers and union crossovers -- about4,000 in all -- to operate its sharply reduced system at ornear capacity during the peak summer travel period.   Mr. Currey said that Greyhound would continue to negotiatewith the ATU but that even if a new contract is reached, thecompany would have jobs for only between 500 and 1,000 of theapproximately 5,800 ATU drivers still on strike.   &quot;For all practical purposes, this event is effectivelyconcluded,&quot; he said of the walkout.   Union officials reacted angrily. &quot;They're almost fightingwords,&quot; said Jim Cushing-Murray, president of the ATU's LosAngeles local. &quot;They're almost the kinds of words you woulduse if you wanted to provoke drivers' responses.&quot;   Talks between the union and the company were suspendedindefinitely after a weekend bargaining session in whichGreyhound proposed a new contract that called for a four-yearwage freeze. The union, whose members took a 23% pay cut whena group led by Mr. Currey bought the company in 1986, hasbeen demanding across-the-board pay increases totaling about13% over three years.</TEXT></DOC>
