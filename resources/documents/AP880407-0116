Adams todaydenied a published report that said Attorney General Edwin MeeseIII spoke to him about retiring and said he wanted Adams to be hissuccessor as the nation's chief law officer.   Adams, who declined an offer Monday to become chief deputyattorney general of the U.S. Justice Department, said his remarksin an interview in Allentown about Meese leaving office weremisinterpreted.   Adams took issue with a story in today's editions of The MorningCall. According to the article, Adams said Meese told him it wasthe White House plan to have Adams named to succeed Meese if Meesewould have to step down.   ``That is not correct,'' Adams said. ``I can tell youunequivocally there was never such a discussion...it's a veryserious mistake.''   Adams said instead he discussed stepping in for Meese when theattorney general was out of the country.   Morning Call City Editor David Erdman said the newspaper storywas correct.   ``The version as we reported is what we'll stand by,'' he said.   The Philadelphia attorney, here visiting Muhlenberg College tolecture on the Constitution, discussed his interview with Meeseduring a meeting with college officials and guests at a receptionWednesday, the newspaper said.   Adams, who was considered for appointment as Meese's chiefdeputy last week, declined the appointment because of reluctance tointerrupt his law practice and leave his family for an indefiniteperiod.   Two ranking Meese aides resigned out of concern that an11-month-old criminal investigation of Meese was hurting theJustice Department's operations and image. A third top JusticeDepartment official left to take a judgeship.   On Tuesday, Meese recommended John C. Shepherd, a formerpresident of the American Bar Association, for the number-two jobat the Justice Department.   According to the Morning Call, Adams said the attorney generalmentioned the possibility that he would leave the post severaltimes. He said he wanted to make sure he fully understood Meese'splan.   ```Well, if you have to leave, you would want me to become theattorney general. Is that correct?''' Adams said he inquired.Meese, he said, replied affirmatively, according to the originalstory.   When asked whether President Reagan would concur, he said Meesereplied: ``I have talked to the president, and that is his wish,also.''   ``I told Mr. Meese that I would do anything that I could tohelp,'' Adams said. ``I would be available for counsel and I didgive him my advice. But I declined the job offer, and I have nosecond thoughts.''   Adams said he does not think much will be accomplished at theJustice Department while Meese is still there.   ``I don't think that he is going to leave, and I don't thinkthat the president is going to remove him. Ronald Reagan is veryloyal to his friends,'' Adams said.   When asked whether he thought Meese would be indicted for hisconduct, Adams responded: ``It is very unlikely that he will beindicted. I don't think that there is sufficient evidence againsthim to support an indictment.''   Although he is not privy to details of the investigation, Adamsemphasized that an 11-month review by special prosecutor James C.McKay has not produced anything against Meese that would warrantprosecution of the attorney general.   The 66-year-old Adams, who recently retired from the 3rd U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals, could not be reached for comment by TheAssociated Press early today because a woman who answered the phoneat his house refused to wake him.</TEXT></DOC>
