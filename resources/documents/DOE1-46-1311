<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-46-1311 </DOCNO><TEXT>In a process for production of high methane content product gas by twophase anaerobic digestion of organic carbonaceous materials wherein afirst acid producing phase converts the organic carbonaceous materialsto form a liquid composition of predominantly low molecular weight acidsused as an influent substrate to a second methane producing phase whichconverts the influent substrate to form the product gas comprising predominantlymethane, the improvement is described comprising: maintaining the firstacid producing phase at substantially atmospheric pressure and desorbingsubstantially all free carbon dioxide as gas from the liquid compositionin the first acid producing phase, thereby substantially reducing thecarbon dioxide content of the influent substrate to the second methaneproducing phase; and pressurizing the second methane producing phase.</TEXT></DOC>
