The $33.65-a-share offer was made July 28 by Hooker Corp. and an investor group including Parisian chairman, Emil C. Hess; president, Donald E. Hess; and executive vice president, Harold L. Abroms. Hooker is an Australian real estate developer.    At the request of the board committee, Hooker and the investor group have extended until Aug. 31 the time for the Birmingham, Ala.-based company to consider the offer.    Parisian's stock closed yesterday in national over-the-counter trading at $30.875 a share, down 12.5 cents.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
