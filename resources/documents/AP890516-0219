Under a restructuring announced Monday, Cray Research will splitinto two companies with the formation of Cray Computer Corp. CrayChairman John Rollwagen will discuss the decision at today's annualshareholders' meeting.   The new company will be formed around Cray-3 operations inColorado Springs, Colo., where Seymour Cray has been busy designinga machine that uses gallium arsenide instead of silicon to speedcomputations.   ``Seymour will once again be in the kind of environment in whichhe thrives, and in which he and his team can aggressively pursuecompletion of the Cray-3 and bring it to market,'' Rollwagen said.   Seymour Cray will become chairman of the new company, which willreceive up to $50 million in equipment and $100 million inoperating funds over the next two years from its parent company,said John Swenson, a company spokesman.   The split comes in response to the overwhelming cost ofdeveloping new generations of supercomputers. The race forsupremacy has become even fiercer recently with the emergence ofJapan's Hitachi Ltd., Fujitsu Ltd. and NEC Corp. as strongcompetitors.   Control Data Corp., a Twin Cities neighbor of Cray, last monthannounced it was shutting down its own supercomputer operation, ETASystems, because of the financial drain. Seymour Cray worked forControl Data before founding Cray Research in 1972.   Rollwagen said the split will allow work to proceed on twodevelopment thrusts _ the Cray-3 in Colorado Springs under the newcompany and the C-90 in Chippewa Falls, Wis., under the existingcompany.   The C-90 is the next generation of the company'sbread-and-butter X-MP machines, of which about 150 are in place.The Y-MP is a recent successor to the X-MP.   The announcement was made after the close of trading on the NewYork Stock Exchange, but rumors of the restructuring prompted aprice increase of $2.62{ a share to $55.75. The stock traded around$48 early last week.   Analysts said the move appears to be designed to cap the amountof money Cray spends on the development of the Cray-3, which couldbe running behind schedule.   ``What it does is, if this Cray-3 continues to run over budgetand $100 million is not sufficient, then the new company, CrayComputer Corp., has to go out and find new money,'' said StephenCohen of SoundView Financial Group of Stamford, Conn.   Seymour Cray's new company almost certainly will have to raisemore money, probably by going into partnership with anothercomputer company, said Jeffrey Canin, a San Francisco-basedcomputer analyst.   The Cray-3, using the gallium arsenide metal alloy as asemiconductor instead of the traditional silicon, will be asuccessor to Seymour Cray's Cray-2.   The Cray-3 and Cray-2 are designed to have at least four timesas much memory as the other Cray machines and compute at a fasterrate. But only about 20 of the Cray-2 machines have been sold.   ``If Seymour has any trouble with the Cray-3, it doesn'tendanger the other part of the business,'' George Lindamood of theGartner Group in Stamford, Conn., said. ``I think it's a goodmove.''   But Peter Zidek, a supercomputer analyst from the Minneapolissuburb of Apple Valley, questioned the move. Even though plans callfor the sharing of some technology, the two companies will becomerivals, he said.   ``It seems like maybe there was a spat'' between Seymour Cray,who stepped down from his administrative post in 1980 to devotehimself to research, and company administrators, Zidek said.   Cray is the largest supercomputer maker in the world, notcounting International Business Machines Corp., which sellsattachments to some of its mainframes that allows them to work likesupercomputers.   ``This is one American industry that is not walking away fromglobal competition,'' Rollwagen said. ``Rather, we're in effectredoubling our effort.''   Cray will seek Internal Revenue Service and regulatory approvalto distribute 90 percent of the stock in the new company toshareholders of Cray Research Inc. on a tax-free basis. CrayResearch will retain the other 10 percent.   The two companies will enter into cross-licensing and technologytransfer agreements involving both hardware and software. Theapproximately 200 employees in Colorado Springs will becomeemployees of the new company. Cray has a total of about 5,400workers.</TEXT></DOC>
