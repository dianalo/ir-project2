(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The last Air Force Titan 3 rocketroared into space with a secret Pentagon satellite today, ending 25years of launches by a workhorse booster that has hurled more than200 satellites into space.   The 16-story-tall rocket, a 34D model, blazed away from itslaunch pad at 1:54 a.m., brilliantly illuminating the darkness as itrumbled skyward.   ``The vehicle is right on track,'' said Air Force Lt. Col. RonRand, the launch commentator.   The Air Force said it was the 135th success in 141 launches forthe Titan 3.   ``We close the book of the Titan 34D and move on to anothergeneration of launch vehicles,'' said Brig. Gen. Thomas W.Honeywill, commander of the Air Force Systems Command. ``I'd like tothank the entire Air Force and industry team for dedicated anddependable service.''   Officials provided no information on today's payload, saying onlythat it was classified. Sources speaking on condition of anonymitysaid the rocket may have carried an advanced reconnaissancesatellite.   A secrecy label has been placed on many of the satellites carriedby Titan 3 rockets since the first was launched here in 1964.   The payloads, most built for the Defense Department, haveperformed many strategic military assignments. Among them were photoreconnaissance, communications, monitoring missile tests,intercepting military and diplomatic messages, verifying Sovietcompliance with arms control treaties and establishing an orbitingsystem to provide instant alert of a hostile missile attack.   The Titan 3s also have had some notable non-classified launches,including two Viking spacecraft boosted toward landings on Mars in1976 and the Voyager 1 and 2 probes dispatched in 1977 toward theouter planets.   Voyager 1 and 2 probed Jupiter and Saturn, while Voyager 2 twoweeks ago week sent back stunning images of Neptune and its moonTriton as it completed a grand tour that included closeup looks atJupiter, Saturn and Uranus.   The Titan 34D launched today was the 15th for that model, whichis the most powerful in the Titan 3 series. It can boost31,650-pound payloads into low Earth orbit or 4,200 pounds tostationary orbit 22,300 miles out.   The Air Force is replacing the Titan 34D with the more powerfulTitan 4, the first of which successfully boosted a missile warningsatellite into orbit on June 14. The new rocket can hoist 39,000pounds to Earth orbit or 10,000 pounds to stationary orbit.   Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems in Denver has a contract tobuild 23 Titan 4s for the Air Force for $5.1 billion. The two arenegotiating for an additional 26 rockets.   Martin Marietta developed the Titan 3 series for the Air Forcefrom the Titan 2 intercontinental range nuclear missile, whichearlier had been modifed to boost into orbit the two-man Geminicapsule in the mid-1960s.   The space booster evolved through the Titan 3A, 3B, 3C and 34Dseries, each more powerful than the last.   ``With this launch, the Titan continued its unparalled successrecord,'' said Gareth D. Flora, president of Space Launch Systems.``Titan expendable launch vehicles have been the backbone of the AirForce's space program for more than 20 years, and we expect theTitan 4 to continue that tradition.''</TEXT></DOC>
