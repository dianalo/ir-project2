As most people know by now, Ford out-earned General Motors, $3.3 billion to $2.95 billion, in 1986. Ford had not led the industry in earnings since the early 1920s, when the elder Henry Ford and his Model T were motorizing the nation.    Roger B. Smith, GM's chief, can only rate 1986 as a bad year. Earnings skidded, market share slipped, luxury-car sales were disappointing and Ross Perot, looking at GM from the inside, said that trying to make the company competitive was like trying to teach an elephant to tap dance. Mr. Smith says he still regards his former adversary as a &quot;good guy,&quot; suggesting that he was not entirely unsympathetic to the criticism. But GM slipped to 109th place from 16th in Fortune's opinion poll of the &quot;most admired corporations.&quot;    GM has bad news for employees, an impending drastic purge of middle management. Ford last week was handing out large profit-sharing bonuses and grateful &quot;well-dones&quot; to all its workers. The payoff has symbolism. Ford already has had a major work-force reduction, yet Don Petersen speaks with zeal about Ford's success in involving and motivating production workers in Ford's competitive struggle.    Clearly, something important has happened at Ford. Not only are its unit costs below GM's but independent ratings of automobile quality now rank Ford first among domestic auto makers. Mr. Petersen has had the top job at Ford only two years, and his predecessor, Philip Caldwell, deserves some of the credit for Ford's comeback. But there can be no doubt of Mr. Petersen's dedication to people power. One of Ford's much-cited innovations was a decision to let hourly workers stop production lines when a quality problem was spotted. It's cheaper to make cars right the first time than to fix mistakes later.    GM, by contrast, has spent the past six years sinking $40 billion into plant and equipment, buying the most advanced robotics and automation. In some cases the results have been good and in others, disappointing. GM received a shock when it discovered that the Chevrolet Nova plant it runs jointly with Toyota in Fremont, Calif., was one of its most efficient, even though it is among the least automated. &quot;It's very hard for any company to spend $40 billion wisely,&quot; wryly observes an electronics company CEO who has watched GM's high-tech experiments. One reason Ford's bottom line looks better than GM's is that GM's plant and equipment depreciation and amortization charges are more than double Ford's. At this point, Ford's people power seems to have succeeded better than GM's machine power.    Also attributable to people power are Ford's recent successes in automotive styling. Some Detroit gurus think styling is the most important single factor in selling cars. Don Petersen, whose successful management of Ford Europe was a bright spot during Ford's dark days, was an advocate of the &quot;world car,&quot; designed for successful world-wide marketing. His judgment was vindicated last year by the warm reception buyers and the automotive press gave Ford's new midsize Taurus and Sable, both characterized by what has been called the &quot;European&quot; look. Ford obviously is regaining its sense of what kind of cars people like to buy and drive.    But even with a low break-even point, improved quality and product successes, Don Petersen obviously worries that the waters will part beneath his feet. He, not Roger Smith, has been the auto executive most vocal in lobbying for new restraints on foreign imports and for further devaluation of the U.S. dollar. He thinks a 120-yen dollar might be about right. And he thinks Ford, having pulled up its socks, deserves more public-policy help.    His arguments deserve challenge, even from Ford's point of view. Auto quotas encouraged the Japanese to aim for the more profitable end of the U.S. auto market. Weak-currency countries, England, for example, have traditionally lost, not gained, comparative advantage over time. Ford itself made some of its most important gains when the dollar was strong, not weak.    Domestic competition no doubt figures into Mr. Petersen's calculus. A tariff on small-car imports, for example, might allow Ford to make some money on its Escort, which sells well but earns little. Because Ford has a higher component of foreign earnings than GM, particularly from Europe, a weak dollar gives its income statement a boost. Ford's foreign earnings, translated into weakened dollars, leaped 74% last year, according to an analysis by Harvey Heinbach of Merrill Lynch. This is mainly an accounting identity, but if it helped Ford become the nation's top earner, it had market importance. Auto buyers like to go with a winner.    Mr. Petersen also has not lost his healthy respect for GM. Although Ford is no pygmy, GM, the largest U.S. manufacturing company, has twice Ford's total assets. It still has strong dealers and strong product loyalty. It's overall quality has improved, too. Mr. Smith may not teach the elephant to tap dance, but it will be a slimmer elephant. He expects to have 25,000 fewer middle managers by the end of this year and a further 15,000 fewer by the end of 1988. He estimates savings at $10 billion. If GM managers have been smug and complacent, as Mr. Perot charges, those attitudes may change.    For all its troubles, GM may be further up the learning curve in high-tech manufacturing than Ford. Its two major acquisitions of the past two years, Hughes Aircraft and Mr. Perot's Electronic Data Systems, operate on the frontiers of technology. EDS is &quot;networking&quot; GM's world-wide data management. Hughes, working with EDS, recently demonstrated its skills in computerized simulation as applied to &quot;computer integrated&quot; manufacturing.    Mr. Smith thinks GM's big capital expenditure, which he describes as a decision to sacrifice short-term results to the &quot;long ball,&quot; has put it well ahead in product engineering. That claim may be overstated, but as GM sets about to freshen up the styling of its disappointing Toronados, Rivieras, Sevilles and Eldorados this year, competitors will watch with interest.    Mr. Petersen's pleas for further public-policy aid are not convincing. Chrysler picked itself up off the mat. Now Ford has done so. And now GM is moving to cope. That kind of response to adversity deserves public admiration but not public-policy reward. The best approach will be to let Don Petersen and Roger Smith, joined of course by the estimable Lee Iacocca and the Japanese and the Germans, continue to slug it out for first claim on the car buyer's dollar. </TEXT></DOC>
