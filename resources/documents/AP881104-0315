(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists at Los Alamos NationalLaboratory said Friday they are working on a cure for viralinfections like the one that infiltrated research computers thisweek.   Computer security experts said the virus made life inconvenientfor researchers, but did no known permanent damage and did not enterthe lab's classified computers.   Computer security officer Jimmy McClary said the laboratory wasable to identify the virus and cleanse it from the system with acode akin to a computer ``vaccine.''   ``The most useful aspect of these sort of events is that theyoccur in an unclassified, non-sensitive environment that lets uslook at the techniques used to introduce these viruses,'' saidMcClary.   This week's virus was able to infiltrate the UNIX operatingsystem that links scientific laboratories nationwide, infecting LosAlamos, its sister facility, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratoryin California, and numerous other government and private researchfacilities.   ``This is the largest scale virus attack that I have seen thatwas distributed across the country,'' McClary said.   A computer virus is a program that ``infects'' other programs bymodifying them to include a copy of itself. It can spread from onecomputer to another and alter or destroy data.   Viruses are usually communicated by data transmission over phonelines, or by someone inserting a contaminated floppy disk into acomputer.   McClary said two main efforts are under way to guard againstfuture viruses.   ``The first is to use computers to guard computers againstviruses _ enhanced intrusion detection techiques that let you lookfor unexpected or unexplained changes in the behavior of a computersystem,'' he said. ``The other approach ... is to develop anti-viralcode, vaccines if you like, to carry the analogy further, thatamount to self-examining code, so the code itself will know ifsomeone makes an unauthorized change to it.''   McClary said scientists working at remote terminals, all usingthe UNIX operating system, began experiencing delays in gainingaccess to their research data late Wednesday. He said he believesthe first clues occurred about an hour after the virus entered thecomputers.   Los Alamos and the other laboratories will analyze the virus codeto determine its source, said McClary.   ``What they'll have to do is follow each path that they're ableto pick up at some point and go back along that path,'' he said.``Generally, you can trace back. We don't know yet enough about thisone. This one does a fair job of cleaning up after itself.''   He said laboratory scientists disconnected the source of thevirus from the computing system Thursday morning. Later in themorning, the U.S. Department of Energy informed the lab a computervirus existed.   The virus came in through the electronic mail system by whichscientific data is transmitted among research institutions, McClarysaid.</TEXT></DOC>
