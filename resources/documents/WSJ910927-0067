The decision, which hasn't been announced, indicates thatthe union hopes to set a pattern at Deere that would befollowed at Caterpillar, the big construction-equipment makerbased in Peoria, Ill. Both contracts expire at midnightMonday.</LP><TEXT>   Union officials, who told of the decision, noted thattalks have been much smoother at Deere, which is based inMoline, Ill. In contrast, the union and Caterpillar bickeredfor weeks over where to meet. Just yesterday, they agreed toopen talks on Saturday in Moline and then move to theBloomington, Ill., area for further discussions.   Deere, which has some 12,000 workers covered by its UAWcontract, had no comment on its status as the union's target.   Spokesmen for both Deere and the UAW said negotiations areon schedule, and are likely to continue through the weekend.&quot;I think it's more than safe to say that talks began in agood spirit of cooperation, and that tenor still holds,&quot; saidthe Deere spokesman.   If an agreement isn't reached by the deadline, the UAWcould either strike or postpone a walkout while it continuesto bargain with Deere. Once an agreement is reached, the UAWwould focus on Caterpillar, which could prove to be a muchtougher round.   Neither Caterpillar nor UAW national officials wouldcomment beyond the announcement that they had agreed onnegotiating sites. The Caterpillar contract covers some17,000 workers in four states.   Relations between the company and the union soured overthe last few weeks as each tried to gain the upper hand intheir dispute over where to meet. Caterpillar mailed copiesof its initial proposal to the union, but the union mailed itback.   Caterpillar is proposing a $1-an-hour increase in its UAWlabor costs over each of three years, to $35.35 an hour. Butunion officials say that when items such as increasing costsof health care are considered, there would be little or noroom for an actual increase in wages.   Caterpillar has also raised the prospect of having unionworkers pay part of the monthly premium for health insurance.The UAW, however, has refused to accept that in the past, andhas indicated a willingness to strike over the issue.   For its part, Caterpillar has said it needs to keep laborcosts under control to remain competitive.</TEXT></DOC>
