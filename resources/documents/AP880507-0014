State Department spokesman Charles Redman said that providingrewards to hostage takers could prolong the ordeal of the remaining18 hostages in Lebanon. Nine of those hostages are Americans.   Redman also called on Iran on Friday to use its influence _newly demonstrated this week _ over kidnappers in Lebanon to helpsecure the release of the 18 captives.   Both the French and Iranian governments acknowledged the Iranianrole in the releases of the three French hostages, Jean-PaulKauffmann, Marcel Carton and Marcel Fontaine.   ``Once again this demonstrates the substantial influence Iranholds over terrorist kidnappers,'' Redman said, adding that it isnot yet clear what prompted Iran to take the action it did.   In any case, he said, ``We again call on Iran to exercise itsproven influence immediately to secure the release of the otherhostages still held in Lebanon.''   France has denied that any money was paid for the hostages'freedom, but Prime Minister Jacques Chirac has made vaguereferences to a bargain with Iran.   Expressing doubts about the propriety of French actions, Redmansaid: ``We've noted the French statements on the subject. We willclosely monitor future developments and we will be especiallysensitive to any actions which could be seen as rewarding thetaking of hostages.''   Redman reaffirmed the longstanding U.S. view that the taking ofhostages should not be rewarded.   ``Such behavior serves only to encourage more terrorism andprolong the ordeal of other hostages, including the nine innocentAmericans.''   Redman also disputed the contention of Peggy Say, sister of U.S.hostage Terry Anderson, who said it almost appears that Franceplaced a higher priority on the lives of the French hostages thanthe American government does on the lives of U.S. hostages.   ``I would reject the notion that our government is lessconcerned than any other government,'' Redman said.   Anderson, 40, is the chief Middle East correspondent of TheAssociated Press. He was abducted on March 16, 1985, and has beenheld longer than any other hostage in Lebanon.   Redman said President Reagan ``reflected feelings of the entireadministration when he said that he shared the frustration of thehostages' families.''   ``They too are the victims of terrorism,'' he said. ``We aredeeply concerned about the hostages and are doing what we can toobtain their release.''</TEXT></DOC>
