Dow's sales in South Africa now approximate $60 million annually, 20% of which is from pharmaceuticals and the rest from industrial sales. Combined, they accounted for less than 1% of Dow's total 1986 sales of $11.4 billion.    Dow declined to disclose the terms of the sale of Mer-National, its South African pharmaceutical business, to an affiliate of Premier Milling Group , a South African conglomerate, and its associates. Mer-National produces Rifadin, a drug used in treating tuberculosis, a major health problem in southern Africa.    Mer-National employs about 125 workers.    Since 1985, about 80 of the 270 U.S. companies doing business in South Africa have closed or sold their operations, according to the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a non-profit research group. The companies have cited poor economic conditions in South Africa, as well as the failure of the government there to take steps to end the country's policy of racial separation.    Moreover, the U.S. government, in passing sanctions against further investment in South Africa in 1986, sent a strong signal that it disapproved of the country's racial policies, according to David Hauck, senior researcher at the center.    A Dow spokesman said the company also has held discussions with potential buyers of its industrial sales operation, which sells chemical commodities such as polyethylene and polystyrene to South African businesses. Dow's industrial sales employ about 75 persons, the company said.    &quot;This move doesn't reflect a sudden change in attitude. Our reasons for wanting to do business in South Africa remain the same. We would have preferred to maintain our business in South Africa, but changing business and economic conditions, as well as growing public concern in the U.S., made it impractical to continue,&quot; said Paul F. Oreffice, Dow president and chief executive officer.    About 40% of Dow's work force in South Africa is black, the company said. Dow has adopted the so-called Sullivan Principles, which call for racial equality on its premises and in its dealings. </TEXT></DOC>
