That is the chief trade-off in the move engineered bySaudi Arabia last week to prop up the price of oil.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;When assessments of demand for OPEC's oil show themomentum for a new production ceiling, possibly by the fourthquarter, those with the capacity to produce should be givenmore than their usual pro rata shares of the increase,&quot; saida senior oil official in one Persian Gulf producing country.   This suggests that the emerging new emphasis on higher oilprices rather than larger output shares by some leadingMiddle East members of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries could be short-lived. These countries,including Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, hold most ofthe world's spare producing capacity as well as the bulk ofits oil reserves and have long maintained that they shouldreceive bigger shares of any increases in demand for OPECoil.   Still, the five oil ministers who met in Saudi Arabia lastweek, from the kingdom as well as from Iraq, Qatar, Kuwaitand the United Arab Emirates, called for a freeze in the OPECproduction ceiling near its current level of 22.1 millionbarrels a day and urged all 13 member nations to adhere totheir output quotas. There also were new pledges by OPEC'schief quota violators, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates,to support the production limits. And there were indicationsfrom the Saudis that they might agree to a temporary drop intheir percentage share from the 24.5% of the productionceiling so vigorously defended in the past.   These developments reversed the recent sharp drop in theprice of oil and set the stage for what is now expected to bea relatively calm midyear conference for OPEC's 13 oilministers rather than the stormy, prolonged sessionspreviously anticipated. The conference begins July 26 inGeneva after a one-day meeting of the eight ministers onOPEC's influential monitoring committee.   &quot;Now, with a framework for at least a temporary agreement,there is a feeling of cautious optimism rather than the worryit was all going to spin out of control,&quot; said a senior OPECofficial.   The United Arab Emirates officially confirmed itswillingness Friday to return to the OPEC fold with a quota of1.5 million barrels a day, 25% less than it is currentlyproducing. Mana Said Otaiba, the country's oil minister, saidthe output cuts would begin immediately. He also endorsed acall by the Iranian oil minister for a $2 increase to $20 abarrel in the OPEC reference price.   OPEC long ago set $18 a barrel as its &quot;minumum&quot; referenceprice for a basket of seven crudes. But the basket's average,which usually lags by several dollars the price of the U.S.benchmark crude, had recently fallen to the year's low of $14a barrel.   The Emirate's acceptance of the quota it had previouslyrejected was the crucial point in Saudi Arabia's plan torestore the OPEC basket average to $18. The Saudis expectedto do that by curbing OPEC's runaway output, which has beenaveraging more than one million barrels above the productionceiling of 22.1 million barrels a day. Before the Emiratesannouncement, Kuwait had reaffirmed its commitment to reduceoutput from 1.7 million barrels a day to its OPEC quota of1.5 million no matter what the Emirates did.   There was industry skepticism that neither Kuwait nor theEmirates would drop production all the way to the lowerlevels or hold it there for long. But OPEC sources noted thatthe prestige of several heads of state, including King Fahdof Saudi Arabia, is on the line. Some, such as PresidentSaddam Hussein of Iraq, have been vociferous in blamingKuwait and the Emirates for the one-third drop in oil prices.   Whatever the doubts, the Persian Gulf proposals resultedin a rebound in oil prices. By Thursday afternoon, the latestweekly average of the OPEC basket of seven crudes had climbedback to $15 a barrel. Some oil officials, including theEmirate's Mr. Otaiba, suggested that the average of thebasket will again reach the minimum reference price of $18 bythe time OPEC meets.   If not, the production ceiling still could be an issue atnext week's OPEC meetings. The Persian Gulf proposals wouldsuggest an increase of 400,000 barrels a day to 22.5 millionin the third-quarter ceiling to accommodate the Emirate's newquota of 1.5 million if all other quotas remain the same. ButGinandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister, said inJakarta last week that he opposes any proposal to increasethe ceiling as long as the OPEC benchmark price remains under$18.   Some Persian Gulf sources said, however, that it may notbe necessary to increase the ceiling much if at all. Therewere suggestions that some of the exporters may allowtemporary cuts in their volumes to help make up the newallotment for the Emirates.</TEXT></DOC>
