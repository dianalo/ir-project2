The 11-week-old artillery war between Christian army units andan alliance of Syrians and Druse militiamen has killed at least 359people, wounded nearly 1,400 and become a leading agenda item atthe Arab League summit in Morocco.   A police spokesman said two MiG-17 jet fighters flew at mediumaltitude over the mountainous southern flank of the 310-square mileChristian enclave, then headed east toward the Syrian-controlledBekaa Valley.   ``They didn't attack and the army didn't open fire at them,''said the spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing rules.   It was the third such flight in a week, he said, with theapparent purpose of photographing positions of Gen. Michel Aoun'sChristian forces around Souk el-Gharb, a resort town southeast ofBeirut.   Earlier in the day, Aoun's men exchanged machine gun fire withthe Syrians and Druse in the area. Souk el-Gharb commands a networkof roads leading to the Christian enclave and the general'sheadquarters in the presidential palace at Baabda.   Syrians fired 130mm shells from Moslem west Beirut spradicallythroughout the day that landed between the Christian ports ofJounieh and Byblos without causing casualties, the police spokesmansaid.   He described the military activity as ``part of the dailyroutine that has been dominating the confrontation since May 11,''when the Arab League called a truce in an attempt to end thebattles.   ``If the summit comes up with resolutions accepted by thegeneral and the Syrians, then the cease-fire will be consolidatedand we will have a lasting truce,'' the spokesman said. ``If thesummit's resolution on Lebanon is rejected by either side, thenwe'll have another round of violence.''   The truce was declared by an Arab League committee that has beentrying to end the current fighting and find a solution to Lebanon's14-year-old civil war.   Lebanon's seat at the summit is vacant because other Arabnations have not recognized either of the rival governments thatresulted from a political crisis last September _ Aoun's and aMoslem cabinet led by Premier Salim Hoss.   Aoun has said his goal is to drive the Syrians from Lebanon, andhe wants the summit to adopt a supporting resolution.   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab Leaguepeacekeeping mandate issued in 1976 and has become the main powerbroker during the long civil war.   The latest fighting began March 8, two days after blockadingillegal ports operated by Moslem militias, which deprive thegovernment of about $100 million in duties every year.   Walid Jumblatt's Druse militiamen started shooting in responseand Syrian forces soon joined them.</TEXT></DOC>
