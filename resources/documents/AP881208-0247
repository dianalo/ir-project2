Marvin Mandel and five others in apolitical corruption case.   U.S. Attorney Breckinridge L. Willcox said he plans to ask theU.S. Solicitor General for permission to seek a review of the rulingby the full 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.   Mandel was charged in 1975 with helping Irvin Kovens, W. DaleHess, Harry W. Rodgers III, William A. Rogers and Ernest Cory Sr.get extra racing days for Marlboro Race Track, which they secretlyowned, while he was governor. He also was accused of accepting$350,000 in gifts and financial help in a divorce settlement.   In a 2-1 decision, the Appeals Court panel upheld a Nov. 12,1987, decision by U.S. District Judge Frederic N. Smalkin that setaside the mail fraud convictions of Mandel and the others. Thejudges agreed with Smalkin's ruling that the jury at Mandel's trialwas allowed to consider a theory of mail fraud law that has sincebeen overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.   In June 1987, the Supreme Court ruled that federal mail fraudstatutes cannot be used to prosecute public officials for defraudingcitizens of their ``intangible rights'' to honest government.   ``Three of the four judges that have recently looked at this casehave concluded that Gov. Mandel and the (other) defendants had beenunjustly convicted for conduct that was not criminal,'' saidMandel's attorney, Arnold Weiner.   Willcox contended that the ruling should not be applied to a casethat was decided 10 years earlier.   ``Mandel's conduct then and now is a crime,'' said Willcox.   The request for a full-court review of the panel's ruling will bebased on a dissenting opinion filed by Judge K.K. Hall, Willcox said.   Hall wrote that ``although their trial included an erroneous juryinstruction, the proceedings were replete with evidence of briberyand manipulation. Their (Mandel and the others) actions were and arepatently illegal.''   Mandel was indicted on the mail fraud charges halfway through hissecond four-year term. He remained in office until the day he wassentenced and won a reversal on appeal, allowing him to resume asgovernor for the last days of his term, which expired in 1979.   Another appellate review reinstated the conviction, and Mandelserved 14 months at a federal prison camp. The appellate decisionstood until Smalkin's 1987 ruling setting aside the convictions.</TEXT></DOC>
