Says Problems With FDA Will Hurt Earnings </HL><SO> </SO><CO> LMED </CO><IN> PHA </IN><G> FDA </G><DATELINE> ROSEMONT, Ill.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   LyphoMed Inc. said its 1988 earnings will be hurt by its recent troubles with the Food and Drug Administration.    The drug maker said it couldn't quantify the possible impact on earnings because of &quot;remaining uncertainties&quot; stemming from its run-in with the FDA. In 1987, LyphoMed reported net income of $21 million, or 70 cents a share, on sales of $173 million.    Last November, following an inspection of the company's Melrose Park, Ill., plant, the FDA said it would stop approving applications for new generic products made in the company's Chicago-area plants until LyphoMed took corrective measures. The FDA inspected the Melrose Park plant again earlier this year.    LyphoMed also said shareholders filed two new lawsuits against the company in federal district court in Chicago in March. The suits allege that the company violated federal securities laws by not making adequate disclosure of FDA compliance matters, the company said.    LyphoMed added that &quot;it is the opinion of management&quot; that the suits won't hurt the company's financial position.    In over-the-counter trading yesterday, LyphoMed stock fell 75 cents to close at $10. </TEXT></DOC>
