<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-25-0265 </DOCNO><TEXT>A coupled one-dimensional (axial/radial) edge-plasma model (SOLAR) hasbeen used to investigate tradeoffs between collector-plate and edge-plasmaconditions in a doublenull, open, high-recycle divertor (HRD) for a preliminaryInternational Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) design. A steady-stateHRD produces in attractive high-density edge plasma (5 {times} 10{sup19}m{sup {minus}3}) with sufficiently low plasma temperature (10-20eV)at a tungsten plat that the sheath-accelerated ions are below sputteringthreshold energies. Manageable plate heat fluxes (3-6 MW/m{sup 2}) areachieved by positioning the plate poloidal cross section at a minimumangle of 15-30{degree} with respect to flux surfaces. 6 refs., 9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
