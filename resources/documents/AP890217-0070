Both are being taken today to the Long Beach Peninsula, justnorth of the mouth of the Columbia River, where one nicknamed ``BlueEye'' was released Thursday, said Bob Byrne of the state WildlifeDepartment.   ``He scurried off into the water and headed out to sea,'' Byrnesaid.   A second sea lion that, like Blue Eye, was captured Wednesday in``Operation Goodbye'' died in captivity later that night whilecoming out of anesthesia, Byrne said.   A fish ladder at the locks, the sole passage for salmon andsteelhead to reach Lake Washington and upstream spawning grounds,has become a favorite feeding spot for about 20 sea lions, whichmigrate through the area from southern California and Mexico.   The relocation program is the sixth effort in five years ofattempts to stop the predation, which has endangered an alreadyfragile steelhead run.   The dead sea lion, found to have a .22-caliber bullet wound inthe neck and a severe infestation of lung worms, was anesthetized soscientists could attach a radio transmitter to monitor the 550-poundcreature's movements.   ``Using anesthesia on the animal was one of the risks that wentalong with studying them,'' said Bob DeLong, a marine mammalbiologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   DeLong said ``Sickie,'' as the creature was dubbed, probably wasshot near the locks, possibly by someone frustrated by the failureof previous efforts to chase the sea lions away.   ``I'm afraid we're going to see more and more shootings,'' hesaid.   The bullet wound and lung infestation however ``may havecompromised his ability ... to withstand the anesthesia,'' DeLongsaid.   Ben Deeble of Greenpeace, which has monitored efforts to rid thelocks of the sea lions and given tentative approval, questionedwhether it was necessary to anesthetize the animals.   He also said he would prefer relocating the animals and markingthem with paint rather than attaching radio transmitters to monitortheir movements.</TEXT></DOC>
