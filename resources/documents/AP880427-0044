He intends to spend some time campaigning in Texas during May,even though the primary was held there in March. The state will bea critical one to his election chances in the fall.   And he is considering a commencement address at a predominantlyblack college as a way of beginning to expand his meager supportamong Jesse Jackson's black constituency, whose voters he needs tobe elected in the fall.   A trip or two to Washington is also likely next month so Dukakiscan be seen conferring with Democratic leaders of Congress, just asVice President George Bush intends to summon Republican experts tohis home in Kennebunkport, Maine during June.   Bush has been running this sort of two-in-one campaign eversince he routed his Republican rivals more than a month ago. Bywinning the final few delegates needed to mathematically clinch hisown nomination, he is free to pick up President Reagan's formalblessing _ the most coveted Republican endorsement of all.   Even before the votes were counted in Pennsylvania Tuesdaynight, Bush had begun stirring his anti-Democratic rhetoric with ananti-Dukakis elixir. The vice president said the Democraticfront-runner lacks foreign policy experience.   ``That will be a major issue in the fall,'' said the former CIAdirector, U.N. ambassador and head of the U.S. delegation to thePeople's Republic of China.   He added, in an interview with the Washington Post, ``Thecountry does not want to move left. They do not want to go back tothe malaise days of Jimmy Carter.'' So long as it works,Republicans enjoy trotting out the former president as a campaignwhipping boy. Never mind that Dukakis has no known relationship toCarter.   Bush's campaign manager Lee Atwater, more pungent than his boss,summarizes the Republican campaign message with a singlewell-turned phrase. Americans, he says, don't want a``Northern-fried Jimmy Carter.''   Dukakis, whose caution is legendary, publicly resists anyattempt by Bush or anyone else to portray him as what he is _ theprohibitive favorite to gain the Democratic nomination. Mostprobably on the first ballot at a unified convention.   In the hour of his Pennsylvania landslide _ more lopsided thanthe one accorded him at home in the Massachusetts primary _ hepointed out that Walter Mondale stumbled four years ago afterwinning primaries in New York and Pennsylvania.   But for all the public disclaimers, he and his aides have begunto pencil in a schedule for the month of May designed to appeal toa nationwide audience rather than a single-state primaryconstituency.   In an Associated Press interview last week, he worked to bluntBush's foreign policy offensive by resurrecting last winter'srhetoric about a ``failed and illegal'' Reagan administrationpolicy in Central America, as well as criticizing the Iran-Contraaffair and policy in South Africa.   The Massachusetts governor also is expected to speaking abouteducation and the environment, two areas in which Bush has soughtgingerly to set himself apart from the Reagan record.   Dukakis also intends to begin fundraising for the Democraticparty nationally and the state parties in the coming weeks.   Dukakis begins that phase of his campaign after next week'sprimaries.   He intends to divide his time this coming week between thestatehouse office in Boston and upcoming primary states Ohio andIndiana. His aim is to avoid a surprising defeat next Tuesday thatwould raise fresh doubts about his candidacy just as Democraticparty leaders begin climbing aboard the bandwagon.   In the process, he also hopes to roll up a lead of severalhundred Democratic National Convention over Jackson, thus pavingthe way for amassing a nominating majority by the time theprimaries end in California and New Jersey on June 7.   Jackson is conceded his victory in the District of Columbia nextweek, but the Dukakis campaign expects it to be the last contestthe Massachusetts governor loses.   After the three primaries next Tuesday, the election calendaroffers a natural break before the finale June 7. Dukakis intends tocampaign in May primary states such as Nebraska, West Virginia andOregon, but not with the intensity that marked his efforts in thestates thus far.   Instead, he will turn his attention to amassing the support ofparty leaders who will be delegates at the Democratic NationalConvention and who hold the votes needed to assure his nomination.Delegates backing the suspended candidacies of Sens. Paul Simon andAlbert Gore Jr. will also be targets.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: David Espo covers presidential politics for TheAssociated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
