To fathom its sheer magnitude, consider this: Counting about $5.5 billion of assumed RJR debt, the total value of this single KKR proposal, at more than $26 billion, is more than twice that of all the mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. in 1975.    And the bidding for RJR may not be over. Aided by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Ross Johnson, RJR's chief executive, put the giant tobacco and food company in play last week with a $17.6 billion buy-out proposal. While it would be a stretch, Mr. Johnson and Shearson are now considering topping KKR's bid, among other options.    The year of the mega-leveraged-buy-out is here, and suddenly no company seems too large. &quot;The leveraged financial industry has been a game of 'Can you top this?' for three years,&quot; says James Grant, the editor of grant's Interest Rate Observer.    RJR promises to take the notion of leveraged one-upmanship to unprecedented -- some say dangerous -- heights. Yet the flow of money into leveraged-buy-out funds such as KKR's and intensified competition on Wall Street is fueling ever-larger bids.    The giant leveraged buy-out is a game that KKR once had almost entirely to itself. But with its proposal last week, Shearson Lehman became the first Wall Street house to muscle onto KKR's turf on such a large scale. Last Friday night, KKR principal Henry Kravis told two top Shearson executives that KKR had to participate in an RJR buy-out &quot;to protect its franchise&quot; as the top buy-out firm, according to people close to KKR and RJR.    The meeting surprised Peter Cohen, Shearson's chief executive and a close friend of Mr. Kravis's. &quot;We ski together and socialize together, and I thought there was a higher level of conduct called for here,&quot; Mr. Cohen says.    An offer the size of KKR's for RJR Nabisco was perhaps inevitable, Wall Street takeover experts say. Never in Wall Street history has so much money chased so few deals. As prime takeover candidates slowly disappeared like some vanishing species, the sights of business acquisitors have risen higher and higher. And with institutional investors clamoring to share the takeover game's mushrooming profits, firms such as KKR for the first time have money to hunt Corporate America's biggest prey.    That became clear last week with the unveiling of Philip Morris Cos.' $11.43 billion hostile takeover offer for Kraft Inc., and Kraft's rejoinder -- a $12.5 billion proposed recapitalization. Other corporations seem to have quickly got the message.    A spokesman for McKesson Corp., a San Francisco-based distributor of pharmaceuticals and health and beauty aids, says he is &quot;awed&quot; by the size of the KKR offer. &quot;When Chevron acquired Gulf a while back, everybody thought we'd never see anything as big as that again.&quot; However, he says McKesson hasn't done anything recently to shore up its defenses, adding that it already has &quot;staggered board terms, supermajority provisions, the poison pill -- all the standard defense structures.&quot;    In today's environment, anti-takeover measures may not work, says Richard W. Single, vice president and general counsel at McCormick andamp; Co., a spice, flavorings and specialty food concern in Hunt Valley, Md. The company adopted some measures last July but isn't taking any actions now.    &quot;We've acted prudently, but if somebody wants to come and make that kind of outlandish offer {such as that for RJR}, I don't know what the hell we can do about it,&quot; he says. &quot;At some price, anybody can be had.&quot;    He says McCormick's managers are &quot;astonished&quot; at the &quot;staggering sums of money&quot; being offered today for companies. He says he isn't worried about a takeover: &quot;How can I worry about something I can't do anything about?&quot; He adds that at McCormick, which has only about $1.25 billion in annual sales, &quot;We never deluded ourselves into thinking we were safe.&quot;    Daniel Akerson, executive vice president and chief financial officer of MCI Communications Corp., says, &quot;The best defense is a good offense,&quot; and that means taking steps to boost the stock price. &quot;You get what you deserve sometimes in life. Today, a company that doesn't have some leverage is crazy,&quot; he adds. If a company is under-leveraged, he says, &quot;shareholders are not getting the value they should have.&quot;    If a $20 billion buy-out was to be announced, few Wall Streeters doubted it would be launched by anyone other than KKR. Started in 1976 by a trio of former Bear Stearns andamp; Co. executives -- Jerome Kohlberg, Henry Kravis and George Roberts -- KKR is considered the founder of the leveraged-buy-out industry. It completed the first major LBO of a public company in 1979, and with a $6.2 billion buy-out of Beatrice Cos. in 1986, the largest LBO ever.    Today, KKR is run by the New York-based Mr. Kravis, 44 years old, and by San Francisco-based Mr. Roberts, 45. The two are first cousins who attended a small California school, Claremont Men's College. Mr. Kohlberg, 63, left to begin a new firm last year. A believer in friendly buy-outs, Mr. Kohlberg disagreed with his partners' wishes to pursue targets more aggressively and with Mr. Kravis's wishes to secretly acquire toehold positions in target companies. &quot;It was a divorce,&quot; says a friend of all three men. All these issues &quot;just caused them to grow apart.&quot;    Since Mr. Kohlberg's departure, KKR has become increasingly aggressive, silently acquiring stock in Texaco Inc. and making unsolicited bids for Kroger Co. -- a proposed $5 billion deal -- among others. Competitors say KKR has been forced to resort to such tactics to put its billions to work and pay off its investors, mainly banks, pension funds, insurance companies and endowments. Its bid for RJR continues its recent series of moves to force itself on essentially unwilling targets.    Terms of the KKR proposal, formally announced yesterday, call for the New York firm to pay $90 a share in cash for 87% of Atlanta-based RJR's shares. Upon closing of the merger, holders of the remaining 13% would receive unspecified securities with an intended value of $90 a share. KKR proposes to launch a tender offer for RJR, but it has said any offer is conditioned upon approval by an outside committee of RJR directors.    As huge as the RJR bid is, few on Wall Street doubt KKR's ability to finance it. With an estimated $5.6 billion in equity, KKR could probably borrow enough money for a $50 billion buy-out and have billions left over. Details of KKR's financing, which would come from commercial banks and three major Wall Street investment banks, won't be known for days.    But one KKR adviser mapped out the following likely plan: KKR invests up to $3 billion in equity; an adviser, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., sells about $5 billion in high-yield junk bonds; $2 billion is raised from issuance of securities to the public; and the remaining $10 billion comes from a bank group led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. KKR's other advisers are Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. and Wasserstein, Perella andamp; Co.    KKR's bid for RJR followed an unsuccessful, year-long drive by the buy-out firm to coax RJR into a deal. According to several people in both camps, KKR's Mr. Kravis first brought up the idea of a buy-out about a year ago in a dinner with RJR chief Johnson. At the time, Mr. Johnson told Mr. Kravis he wasn't interested in dealing with KKR, according to persons familiar wih the conversation.    Fee-hungry Wall Street bankers persisted, however. At various times in the past year, Shearson, Drexel and Morgan Stanley all attempted to arrange an RJR-KKR marriage. And the consumer goods giant didn't rule out the possibility of going private. Just after Labor Day, Mr. Johnson turned to his close friend, James Robinson, the chairman of American Express Co., Shearson's parent, about backing a buy-out.    Mr. Johnson subsequently appproached RJR's board with the leveraged buy-out idea. According to one director, Mr. Johnson said that while he was confident he could improve RJR's revenue and earnings, he was frustrated that he couldn't do more with its stock price, which was in the mid-50s the day before his bid. He then said that he had the backing to make a $75-a-share leveraged buy-out offer but added that he wouldn't do so without the board's approval. The board went along, recognizing that in doing so it raised the possibility of receiving an outside offer, such as the one KKR made.    When the RJR-Shearson deal was announced last week, several of Mr. Kravis's investment bankers, including Morgan Stanley's Eric Gleacher, phoned RJR executives and directors expressing KKR's dismay and continued interest in participating in an RJR buy-out. An aide to Mr. Kravis told Shearson that Shearson's backing for an RJR buy-out might force KKR to cancel certain pending deals with Shearson. Shearson officials, considering it a threat, agreed to meet with Mr. Kravis Friday evening.    According to three people familiar with that meeting, Mr. Kravis said he &quot;simply must&quot; be allowed to participate in the RJR deal. He fretted that firms such as Shearson, with its backing by American Express and its corporate clients, were making inroads into KKR's business. &quot;We have to be in this deal,&quot; Mr. Kravis told Mr. Cohen. &quot;I can't afford not to. It's my franchise.&quot;    Mr. Cohen, who is taking an active interest in the RJR deal because of the estimated $4 billion that Shearson would lend RJR, pleaded with Mr. Kravis not to become involved, according to these people. Mr. Kravis laid out three alternatives: KKR could become partners with Shearson in the deal; RJR could sell KKR its food business; or the two Wall Street firms could compete for RJR. The two Wall Street firms decided to talk again this week. But Mr. Kravis, after consulting with advisers for seven hours on Sunday, chose to make a public proposal yesterday morning.    &quot;I was very surprised when he called me,&quot; said Mr. Cohen. &quot;I thought we had an agreement.&quot;    ---                      KKR-Led Buy-Outs                                               PARTNERSHIPS' COMPANY                                            CONTROL* DAW Forest Products                                   98% Mandamp;T                                                   98 Stop andamp; Shop                                           92 Fred Meyer Real Estate                                90 Owens-Illinois                                        90 Beatrice                                              88 Duracell                                              88 Motel 6                                               88 Pac Trust                                             88 Safeway                                               85 Jim Walter                                            83 Printing Finance                                      80 Seaman Furniture                                      80 Dillingham                                            75 Red Lion Inns                                         75 Fred Meyer                                            67 IDEX                                                  56 U.S. Natural Resources                                49 SCI Television                                        45 W-I Forest Products                                   44 Union Texas Petroleum                                 39 Marley                                                26 L.B.
