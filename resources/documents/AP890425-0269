RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court ruled today that states maytax companies for oil and gas taken from Indian reservations.   Voting 6-3, the justices handed Western states an importantvictory in upholding a New Mexico tax on oil and gas taken from theJicarilla Apache reservation there.   The court said the state levy does not trample on Indian rightsand is not unfair to a petroleum company _ even though the companymust pay taxes to the state and the tribe.   The court rejected arguments that the state tax interferes withtribal economic development by prompting producers to look offIndian reservations for mineral deposits.   New Mexico officials told the court the dispute is of greatconcern in the West. They said there are more than 150 cases ofcompanies with deposits on Indian land protesting such doubletaxation in Arizona, New Mexico, Montana and Utah.   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said Congresshas not specifically pre-empted the power of states to tax oil andgas on Indian lands.   ``Any impairment to the federal policy favoring the exploitationof on-reservation oil and gas resources by Indian tribes ... issimply too indirect and too insubstantial to support'' a claim thestate tax is pre-empted, Stevens said.   Stevens rejected arguments by Cotton Petroleum Inc., which has alease with the Apaches for oil and gas on the reservation, that itis subject to unfair double taxation.   ``It is, of course, true that the total taxes paid by Cotton arehigher than those paid by off-reservation producers,'' he said.``But neither the state nor the tribe imposes a discriminatory tax.The burdensome consequence is entirely attributable to the factthat the leases are located in an area where two governmentalentities share jurisdiction.''   Stevens also noted that New Mexico provides services to CottonPetroleum on the reservation.   There is no constitutional requirement that the services thecompany receives be equal in value to the amount of taxes it pays,Stevens added.   The Constitution does not demand that ``benefits received from atax authority by an ordinary commercial taxpayer ... must equal theamount of its tax obligations,'' he said.   Finally, Stevens rejected an assertion that the Apache tribe isa ``state'' and therefore Cotton Petroleum is subject to multiplestate taxation.   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said NewMexico is increasing its revenue ``at the expense of tribaleconomic development.'' That violates federal policy, expressed inlaws and regulations, to protect Indian self-determination, he said.   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan and ThurgoodMarshall.   Cotton Petroleum challenged taxes on oil and gas taken from some15,000 acres of land on the Jicarilla Apache reservation.   The company pays taxes to the tribe amounting to about 6 percentof its prpoduction, and New Mexico levies five taxes on the companyamounting to 8 percent of its production.   Cotton Petroleum noted that oil and gas producers in the statewith deposits taken from non-Indian land only pay 8 percent inroyalties.   The company said it paid $2.3 million in taxes to New Mexicofrom 1981 through 1985 but received only $89,000 in services fromthe state.   Today's ruling upholds a 1987 decision by the New Mexico Courtof Appeals.   The Jicarilla tribe was not a direct participant in the case. Itfiled a so-called friend-of-the-court brief expressing itsopposition to the state tax.   In other action, the court:   _ Upheld a 1986 federal law imposing ``safety user fees'' onpipeline companies that transport natural gas and hazardous liquids.   The court reversed the ruling of a federal magistrate inOklahoma that the law, which allows the secretary of transportationto impose user fees to pay for pipeline safety programs,unconstitutionally gives the executive branch too much of Congress'power to impose taxes.   _ Tossed out a dispute over the federal government's power toban newspapers from publishing lists of winners in privately runlotteries.   The justices ruled 6-3 that a controversy from Minnesota hasbecome moot because the government no longer intends to enforce theban.   The Indian reservations case is Cotton Petroleum vs. New Mexico,87-1327.</TEXT></DOC>
