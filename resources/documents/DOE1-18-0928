The model maybe tested in collider experiments and through ''dynamical'' effects associatedwith the existence of a weakly interacting majoron. Apart from astrophysicaleffects, majoron emission can produce observable changes in {mu} andtau decay spectra for parameter values that substantially reduce thesolar neutrino flux. A signature of the model is the possible observationof the decay {mu}{yields}e+majoron.</TEXT></DOC>
