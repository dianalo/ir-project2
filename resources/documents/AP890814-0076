(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists today reported that anexperimental vaccine protected monkeys from the AIDS virus, but theywarned that the approach is unlikely to work in humans.   Scientists from the New England Regional Primate Research Centergave inactivated virus to six macaque monkeys. Two remained free ofinfection when challenged with live virus. The others contracted thevirus but did not get sick.   The researchers said theirs is the first published reportdescribing successful vaccine protection against infection by theAIDS virus.   ``At the very least, this vaccine seems to delay or prevent theonset of disease symptoms,'' said Dr. Ronald C. Desrosiers, whoheaded the team. ``In some cases, it seems to have even preventedinfection.''   Their report was published in today's issue of the Proceedings ofthe National Academy of Sciences.   The scientists cautioned that the experiment was conducted undercarefully controlled laboratory conditions. The monkeys weremonitored extremely closely and challenged with virus when theirimmune response from vaccination was the strongest.   Desrosiers said that a human vaccine would have to elicit a morepowerful and sustained immune response.   ``While we believe that this demonstrates that it is possible toachieve some protection, a similar vaccine with the human virus isnot likely to be useful in humans,'' he said.   The work was first presented in June at an AIDS meeting inMontreal. At the meeting, researchers from the the University ofCalifornia, Davis, reported trying a similar approach in monkeys,but their attempt failed to protect the animals from infection.   Both experiments used vaccine made from inactivated simianimmunodeficiency virus, or SIV. This virus is a close relative ofHIV, the virus the causes AIDS in people.</TEXT></DOC>
