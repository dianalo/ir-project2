The Conference recommendsinteragency cooperation in situations where an agency is considering indemnificationof a contractor but has insufficient technical expertise to assess thehazard or the degree of risk. The recommendation also calls for compilationof information on existing indemnity clauses and any claims under them.Recommendation 88-3, the Federal Reserve Board's Handling of ApplicationsUnder the Bank Holding Company Act, urges the Federal Reserve Board toprovide by regulation that its 91-day rule governing action on applicationsunder the Bank Holding Company Act will be delayed only if highly significantinformation is received that warrants reopening an applicant's file. TheConference also seeks to equalize the bargaining process between applicantsand the Board with regard to voluntary commitments and regulatory conditionsimposed on applicants, all of which would be made part of final Board orders.Recommendation 88-4, Deferred Taxation for Conflict-of-Interest Divestitures,calls on Congress to amend the Internal Revenue Code to permit deferredtaxation of gains when appointees to high-level government positions arerequired to divest property to satisfy federal conflict-of-interest requirements.These persons would be permitted to sell property presenting a conflictof interest, reinvest the proceeds in an approved neutral investment fundand maintain their original basis in the divested property. The Conferencealso recommends that Congress consider, at an appropriate time, extendingsimilar tax treatment to other individuals serving in the executive branch.Recommendation 88-5, Agency Use of Settlement Judges, focuses on agencyadjudicatory processes and calls for agencies to use a separate settlementjudge_not the presiding judge in the case_to assist the parties in somecases to reach agreement. The Recommendation is based on the view that,in many cases, a separate settlement judge can exercise greater settlement-inducingauthority than the presiding judge. The settlement judge assists by lendingstructure to the negotiations, controlling their pace, reducing the adversarialnature of the process, and helping the parties to assess objectively boththe strengths and weaknesses of the case and to find a reasoned, legallydefensible settlement. Recommendation 88-5 suggests procedures for usingthe settlement judge technique and guidelines that seek to balance potentialgains in efficiency against possible abuses that may result from an increasingreliance on settlement in administrative proceedings. The Conference's Statement, Dispute Resolution Procedure in Reparationsand Similar Cases, is based on research into the ``reparations'' proceduresat the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The Statement offers generaladvice on approaches to reparations and similar programs that are designedto safeguard consumers. It briefly describes the innovative processes developedby the CFTC and expresses the Conference's view that programs that offercomplainants procedural options, like the CFTC's optional three-tieredprocess, have important benefits. The Statement suggests that agenciesadministering statutes that recognize a private right of action considerseeking authority to establish a reparations program offering such creativeprocedures. The Statement also sets forth several factors for agenciesto take into account as to management of reparations programs, involvingdiscovery, identity of decisionmakers, hearings, and case tracking.Recommendations and statements of the Administrative Conference are publishedin full text in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>upon adoption.

The PresidentialTransition Act of 1963 recognizes that a smooth transition is necessaryto ``assure continuity in the faithful execution of the laws and in theconduct of the affairs of the Federal Government, both domestic and foreign,''and it directs all officers of the government to take steps to promotethe orderly transition of power between the outgoing and incoming administrations.\1\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 78 Stat. 153, section 2; 3 U.S.C. 102 note.<ITAG tagnum="21">Since 1933, when Inauguration Day was moved forward from March 4 toJanuary 20, the length of presidential transitions has been moved between71 and 79 days. However, the size and complexity of the transition taskhas grown steadily over time, corresponding to the tremendous growth infederal responsibilities. Each new President-elect has required a largerand more sophisticated transition organization than his predecessor.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The President-elect's transition organization must, in this briefperiod, prepare to provide the new leadership with comprehensive informationon the organization and responsibilities of each federal agency; on theresources within each agency, including the budget, legislative initiatives,personnel and grants or contracts; and on the policy questions that willrequire decision by the new administration. This information is the basisfor the President-elect's personnel, budgetary and policy decisions duringthe critical initial period of the new administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A large number of private citizens must be relied upon to accomplishthese important tasks. During the 1980-81 presidential transition, oversix hundred persons, most serving as volunteers, had active assignmentson agency transition teams. Many of these persons were selected becauseof their substantive knowledge of the agency's mission, acquired eitherthrough past service in the government or in private sector jobs that broughtthem in contact with the agency. The magnitude and importance of the transitiontasks, and the limited time available to complete them, suggest that futurePresidents-elect will continue to rely upon large numbers of private citizens,some of whom later will be offered government appointments but many ofwhom will return to their private sector jobs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Administrative Conference wishes to encourage the participationof well qualified individuals in presidential transitions, but it recognizesthat the presence of large numbers of private transition workers dealingwith federal agencies offers the potential for conflicts of interest orabuse of the public trust that accompanies their special access to governmentinformation and facilities. The Conference is not acting upon knowledgeof serious problems in this regard in recent transitions, but rather uponthe need to prevent such problems from occurring in the future.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In this recommendation the Conference urges the President to issuean executive order to the heads of all federal agencies (including independentregulatory agencies), conditioning special access to federal agency recordsand facilities by members of the President-elect's transition team upontheir agreement in writing to the standards of conduct set forth in theAppendix to this recommendation. The recommended executive order wouldcover the activities only of ``special transition team members,'' <T3>i.e., </T3>transition workers, who are not existing government employees,who serve with or without compensation, and who are authorized by the President-elect'stransition organization to seek or obtain access to non-public governmentinformation. The Conference believes that private citizens are not, andshould not be considered, special government employees and thereby subjectto federal conflict-of-interest laws, solely because of their activitiesas special transition team members.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Two concerns are addressed by this recommendation. First, federalagency officials need to know who actually represents the President-electbefore granting special access to information. Second, the public needsassurance that authorized transition workers will not use such informationto further their own financial interests or the interests of their presentor future employers or other private persons.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Conference believes that the recommended executive order and transitionstandards of conduct will alleviate these concerns without reducing theflexibility of the President-elect's transition effort. By urging the Presidentto direct federal agencies affirmatively to cooperate with authorized transitionpersonnel to the extent permitted by law and consistent with their officialduties, the recommendation should facilitate the President-elect's transitionefforts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Conference's recommendation includes requirements contained inpending legislation to amend the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 forminimal disclosure of personal or financial information by transition teamworkers.\2\<NOTE/> The Conference believes that transition team members shouldsupply this limited information to agencies, whether or not the pendinglegislation is enacted. The Conference also recommends that special transitionteam members agree not to use non-public government information, or totake any action as transition team members which could further their ownfinancial interests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ H.R. 3932, passed by the House of Representatives on March31, 1988, and S. 2037, passed by the Senate on April 26, 1988, would requiredisclosure of the names of transition team workers, their most recent employmentand the source of funding of their transition activities as a conditionof receipt of public funds for transition activities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendation</ITAG>1. The Conference recommends that the President issue an executive orderthat conditions access by special transition team members to governmentfacilities or non-public information upon their agreement in writing tothe standards of conduct set forth in the Appendix to this recommendation.The term ``special transition team member'' is used herein to mean a personwho is not a government employee, who serves with or without compensationas a member of a transition team, and who is authorized by the President-electto seek or obtain access to non-public government information or facilities.2. The executive order should direct the heads of all federal agenciesto require the President-elect's transition organization to provide eachagency with a list of the special transition team members for that agency,copies of their written agreements to comply with the standards of conductand copies of information disclosure statements, as a condition of accessby such members. The agencies should be required to maintain and make thosedocuments available to the public upon request.3. The executive order should direct all agency heads, subject to the aboveconditions, to cooperate with persons named by the President-elect or hisdesignees as special transition team members to the extent permitted bylaw and consistent with the performance of official duties. 4. The executive order should direct all agency heads to take appropriateaction against any person found to have violated the standards of conductagreement, including, where authorized and in accordance with applicableprocedures, barring the person from employment, receipt of contracts, representationof others before the agency, or referral of the matter to appropriate professionaldisciplinary bodies. <ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix_Transition Code of Ethical Conduct </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Each person who is not an employee or special government employeeof the federal government and who assists in the presidential transition,with or without compensation, and who is designated by the President-electto seek or obtain access to non-public government information or facilitiesduring the transition period (herein referred to as a ``special transitionteam member''), shall agree to comply with the following standards of conductas a condition of such access.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">1.

Concurrent Representation in Agency Proceedings </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">During the transition period, a special transition team member shallnot advise or represent, with or without compensation, anyone in any particularmatter involving a federal agency to which he or she has had access tonon-public information. This restriction does not extend to the specialtransition team member's firm or organization, but the team member shouldadvise his or her firm or organization to establish procedures to assurethat the team member does not participate in any way in any such agencyproceeding.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">5. Misuse of Government Property </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A special transition team member shall conserve and protect federalproperty entrusted to him or her, and shall not use federal property, includingequipment and supplies, other than for purposes directly related to transitionactivities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">6.

Definitions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As used in this Appendix [Order], the terms ``employee,'' ``specialgovernment employee,'' ``particular matter'' \3\<NOTE/> and ``particular matter involving a specific party or parties''shall have the same meaning as in Title 18, United States Code 202-209.The term ``transition period'' shall extend from the date of the generalelection in which the identity of the President-elect is established untilInauguration Day, or if the transition organization continues to operateafter the inauguration, such later date through which the special transitionteam member continues to serve in that capacity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ It is noted that the term ``particular matter'' has beeninterpreted to include rulemaking and general policy matters, and extendsto all discrete matters that are the subject of agency action, no matterhow general the effect.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 305.88-2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Federal Government Indemnification of Government Contractors (RecommendationNo. 88-2).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Indemnification of government contractors for third-party liabilityinvolves this issue: Who should bear the risk of liability for injury ordamage to a third party caused by products and services supplied by governmentcontractors? This issue is especially significant when the products andservices involve high-risk or hazardous governmental activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The liability of the government is limited by the doctrine of sovereignimmunity, which has been waived only in certain situations, such as theFederal Tort Claims Act. Some courts have recognized a common law immunityfor government contractors who have complied with pertinent governmentspecifications and have disclosed all known defects or hazards to the government.*<NOTE/> In the absence of insurance or indemnity, government contractsmay be exposed to claims based, for example, on alleged failure to followspecifications or adequately warn the government or others about productdesign defects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>* Subsequent to adoption of the recommendation, in a caseinvolving military equipment, the Supreme Court accepted this view. See<T3>Boyle v. United Technologies, </T3>56 U.S.L.W. 4792 (U.S. June 27,1988).<ITAG tagnum="21">No government-wide legislation provides generally for indemnificationof government contractors for third-party liability, although a numberof individual departments and agencies are authorized to indemnify contractors.\1\<NOTE/> All of the laws authorizing government indemnification ofcontractors state conditions that must be met before contractual indemnitybeen met. Thus some statutes restrict indemnification to unusually hazardousgovernmental activities or activities that may result in catastrophic lossesand further require the contractor to obtain such insurance as is available.Indemnification clauses included in contracts usually contain further conditions,some of which are required by agency rule. A common restriction is thatthe indemnity does not cover claims resulting from the contractor's willfulmisconduct.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Examples are the National Defense Contracts Act, 50 U.S.C.1431, as implemented by Executive Order 10789 (providing for indemnificationunder national defense contracts for unusually hazardous or nuclear risks);section 2354 of title 10 of the United States Code (providing for indemnificationfor unusually hazardous defense research and development activities); section170 of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended by the Price-Anderson Act of 1957,42 U.S.C. 2210(d) (providing indemnification for activities involving therisk of a substantial nuclear incident); the Federal Aviation Act, as amended,49 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq. </T3>(providing for indemnification for risks where aircraftoperations are necessary to carry out U.S. foreign policy); and the NationalAeronautics and Space Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2458b (providing for indemnificationfor damages related to the launch, operation or recovery of space vehicles).<ITAG tagnum="21">Indemnification clauses are reserved for unusual circumstances, andfew contractors are actually provided with indemnity. The Department ofDefense, for example, included indemnification clauses in an average ofabout 70 contracts per year in the five-year period 1980-1984; by way ofcomparison, during fiscal year 1984 alone, the Department entered intoover 14.8 million contract actions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Conference's study of contractual indemnification found virtuallyno evidence of claims made on the basis of indemnification clauses or litigationover such claims. Although there is no indication that the government hasincurred significant costs under contractual indemnity provisions in the30 years that have passed since enactment of the National Defense ContractsAct in 1958 and the Price-Anderson Act in 1957, the space shuttle disasterand the Three Mile Island nuclear incident suggest that contingent liabilitiesunder indemnity agreements are potentially costly.\2\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ In 1982, the Comptroller General issued an opinion (B-201072,May 2, 1982; reconsid. 62 Comp. Gen. 361 (1983)) stating that to complywith the Federal Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. 1341, indemnity clausesin government contracts must specify that the indemnity is available onlyto the extent of available authorized appropriations. This limitation,however, has limited impact where Congress has set maximum indemnity limitsby statute, as in the Price-Anderson Act, or where no ceiling is set, asin the National Defense Contracts Act. The Price-Anderson Act reauthorizationis pending as of the date of this recommendation.<ITAG tagnum="21">The Conference's study found that agencies generally do not believethat current practices and limits on indemnities discourage potential contractorsfrom bidding. Federal agencies, with few exceptions, see little need forgreater indemnification authority or for broad legislation that would extendindemnities to government contractors generally. However, this view isnot shared by many federal contractors. They take the position that thedecreasing availability of private insurance for a broad range of hazardousactivities is greatly reducing the pool of bidders for contracts involvingthose activities in the absence of government indemnification. This legislativedebate is beyond the scope of the present recommendation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While the Conference takes no position on the current debate overproposals to expand agency authority to indemnify contractors for hazardousactivities, mass injuries, or other special circumstances, the Conferencedoes recommend the compilation of certain information that would providea better basis in the future for ascertaining the need for and risks associatedwith broader indemnification.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This recommendation identifies several factors that agencies shouldconsider when they determine whether to grant an indemnity clause to aparticular contractor. It is appropriate for agencies to consider the scopeof the indemnity proposed to be granted, including the proper mix of self-insurance,private insurance, and government indemnity. The factors listed shouldalso be considered by Congress in deciding whether to grant new authorityto an agency to indemnify its contractors.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Decisions to indemnify ordinarily require an assessment of whetherthe activity in question involves an unacceptable hazard or degree of risk.Sometimes the degree of risk is defined in terms of availability of insurance.Agencies regularly engaged in high-risk activities and able to grant indemnityclauses, such as the Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory Commission,or National Aeronautics and Space Administration, would normally have theresources to perform risk assessments. However, other agencies that confrontthese issues less frequently may not have adequate technical expertiseto decide. It has been asserted that there is often great uncertainty,and such decisions may be made inconsistently. The recommendation suggestsreferral and interagency cooperation as a way of meeting this problem.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendation</ITAG>1. <T3>Identification of Agency Authority to Indemnify. </T3>Each agency thathas, and intends to exercise, the authority to indemnify any of its contractorsagainst liability to third parties should set forth, in a policy statementor regulation, the agency's understanding of the extent and source of itsauthority to indemnify contractors. The agency should consult with theDepartment of Justice and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy in draftingthe statement or regulation.2. <T3>Agency Decision Whether to Grant an Indemnity Clause. </T3>Before decidingto grant an indemnity clause to a contractor, an agency should identifythe public benefits expected to be gained by such a grant and should takeinto account:(a) The nature and magnitude of the risks involved in the covered activities,including the danger inherent in the work to be performed, the adequacyof the state of the art to assess the inherent danger, the aggregate liabilitythat could be incurred, when the liabilities might be incurred, and howcurrent insurance policies would apply to such liabilities; (b) The scope of the indemnity proposed to be granted;(c) The source of funds that would be used to pay an award under the indemnityclause, including the possible application of the Federal Anti-DeficiencyAct, and the impact, if any, that such an award will have on the programsof the agency or other units of the government;(d) The incentives that either providing or denying an indemnificationclause would give the agency for supervising contractual performance, soas to provide for maximum protection of the public from injury and to protectthe government from unwarranted liability in light of the identifiablerisks;(e) The incentives that the contractor would have, assuming indemnificationwere granted, for performing under the contract in a safe and prudent manner;(f) The incentives that the contractor would have, assuming indemnificationwere granted, to defend itself or to help defend the government in anysubsequent litigation; and (g) Any effects, assuming indemnification were granted, on the abilityor the willingness of the insurance industry to make available privateinsurance for the kinds of activities to which the indemnification wouldapply.3. <T3>The Need for More Information. </T3>Each agency that has paid out anysum of money or received any claims for payment under a contractual obligationto indemnify a contractor, or on whose behalf such sums have been paidby the federal government, should report all such payments and claims tothe Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) on an annual basis. TheOFPP should periodically issue a report summarizing the information received.All such reports should be made available to the public except to the extentthat release of any information included is prohibited by law. The OFPPshould also obtain from each affected agency a list, updated periodically,of all existing contracts containing indemnity clauses.4. <T3>Contracting Office Expertise. </T3>Where an agency is considering whetherto grant an indemnity clause, but does not have sufficient technical expertiseto assess the degree of risk, the extent of the hazard, or the availabilityof insurance, these questions should be referred to an office of the agencythat does have the requisite expertise to assist the contracting officein making such decisions. If the contracting agency as a whole lacks theexpertise required to assess these matters adequately (for example, whereunusual or newly emerging technological risks are involved), the agencyshould seek the assistance and cooperation of other agencies. Agencieswith pertinent experience or knowledge should cooperate to make availableto requesting agencies staff members whose experience in risk assessmentmay be helpful. It may be appropriate to create a small, highly-qualifiedrisk assessment office to furnish or coordinate such assistance. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 305.88-3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">The Federal Reserve Board's Handling of Applications Under the BankHolding Company Act (Recommendation 88-3).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Among the Federal Reserve Board's (FED's) responsibilities is implementationof the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA) (12 U.S.C. 1841 <T3>et seq.</T3>). The BHCA's principal purposes are to ensure the safeand sound operation of bank holding companies (BHCs), to promote competitionwithin the banking industry, and to separate banking from commerce. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Under the BHCA, the FED has also been authorized to determine theextent to which BHCs may engage in ``non-banking'' activities in the parentBHC and in non-bank subsidiaries. Because the banking industry has undergonerapid changes in the face of new technologies, the line between bankingand other financial activities has been blurred. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Under section 3 of the BHCA, the FED receives applications for theformation of or acquisition of banks by BHCs. The statutory factors whichthe Board must apply in acting on section 3 applications include an evaluationof the competitive impact of the transaction, the convenience and needsof the community to be served, and the financial and managerial resourcesof the applicant. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Under section 4(c)(8) of the Act, the FED receives applications byBHCs to acquire non-banking interests. Such applications are to be approvedonly when the activities involved are ``closely related'' to and a ``properincident'' to banking. These questions have become of particular significancemost recently in applications involving proposed securities and insuranceactivities of BHCs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Applications under both sections are generally resolved without theneed for an evidentiary hearing, although informal hearings and meetingsare sometimes held. Both sections do, however, provide for an overall 91-daytime limit on the FED's action on individual applications ``beginning onthe date of submission to the Board of the complete record on the application.''The FED routinely processes well over 90 percent of the applications receivedby the FED within 60 days of ``acceptance'' of the application by the ReserveBank (the Bank is permitted to request information, but otherwise mustadhere to a short deadline in accepting the application and fowarding itto the FED). The FED's regulations specifically provide that, in everycase in which an application has not been considered by the FED within60 days of acceptance, the applicant will be notified and provided a writtenexplanation for the delay. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In its regulations, the FED defines when the record on a particularapplication is complete for purposes of determining when the statutory91-day period has begun. Under the FED's regulations, the 91-day periodbegins on the the latest of four dates: (1) The date of acceptance of theapplication; (2) the last day of the public comment period (which is usuallyafter acceptance of the application, and is the date upon which the 91-dayperiod begins in the majority of cases); (3) the date of receipt of anyrelevant material information regarding the application; and (4) the dateof completion of any hearing or other proceeding regarding the application.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because the statute provides that the 91-day period does not beginuntil the complete record has been submitted to the FED, the courts havedetermined that the 91-day period may be tolled or retriggered after theclose of the public comment period if new material information is submittedduring the processing of the application. Examples of this type of informationinclude comments or protests from interested parties, changes in the financialcondition of the applicant, proposed efforts by the applicant to raiseadditional capital, or proposed divestiture plans to accommodate competitiveproblems. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because there is always the possibility that submission of additionalmaterial information may toll or retrigger the 91-day period, the 91-dayperiod is rendered rather uncertain in practice. Therefore, the Conferencesuggests that the FED's regulations on this issue ensure that there isa point in the application process at which the FED will declare that theapplicant's file is deemed to be informationally complete, thus triggeringthe 91-day rule, unless additional information of a highly significantnature relating to the application is received. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The nature of the regulatory process established under the BHCA encouragesa participatory approach to decisionmaking on the part of applicants andthe FED. Various kinds of conditional order are used by the FED to tailorits regulatory decisions to the specific applicant before it. These regulatoryconditions appear or are referenced in the FED's final order, and suchconditions are subject to judicial review.

In other instances, divestiture of property bysuch appointees would be simpler and serve conflict-of-interest purposesbetter than the establishment of qualified blind trusts or subsequent andsometimes frequent recusals by an official from participation in particulardecisions. In addition, persons serving in the government occasionallyare required to divest themselves of property before accepting a new positionor as a condition to participating in a particular matter. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Divestiture of property to avoid conflicts of interest will oftenresult, under current law, in financial losses in the form of taxationof the gains realized as a result of divestiture. The Administrative Conferencebelieves that this tax burden is a disincentive to individuals who wouldotherwise accept a federal appointment, and in the case of present officials,an unnecessary burden resulting from their performance of official responsibilities.The adverse effects of this disincentive to government service are mostacute with respect to the most senior positions involving major policymakingroles. Failure to obtain the best people for those positions, or the frequentrecusals of people in those positions, may have serious adverse consequenceson both the individuals involved and the government. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Conference accordingly recommends that Congress amend the InternalRevenue Code to permit deferred taxation of gains for presidential appointeessubject to Senate confirmation and other individuals entering the governmentto accept high level executive branch positions, whenever they are requestedor ordered by an appropriate authority to divest themselves of propertyto avoid actual or potential conflicts of interests. The Conference alsorecommends that Congress consider amending the Code to extend similar taxtreatment to persons serving in the executive branch.\1\<NOTE/> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\This recommendation is limited to executive branch appointeesand employees because the Conference by statute is limited to studyingand recommending improvements to administrative procedure, 5 U.S.C. 571-576.The Conference, therefore, takes no position on whether or not similartax treatment should be accorded to officials of the judicial branch. <ITAG tagnum="21">The Conference proposes that this defined class of persons be permittedto sell such property and to place the proceeds in a neutral investmentvehicle and maintain their original basis in the divested property.

Congress should amend the Internal Revenue Code to permit presidentialappointees who are subject to Senate confirmation and other officials enteringthe government to accept high level executive branch appointments, to divestproperty, such as securities, and reinvest the proceeds in a neutral investmentvehicle and thereby defer realization of taxable gains. 2. Such amendment should take into account the following factors: (a) The need to assure that the divestiture is undertaken to avoid actualor potential conflicts of interests, by conditioning the deferral on anorder or request of the President (or his delegate such as the White HouseCounsel or the Director of the Office of Government Ethics); (b) The need for divestiture by spouses, dependent children, and otherswhose assets may be imputed to the federal official for conflict-of-interestpurposes, by making deferral available to them also; and (c) The need to assure that the reinvestment vehicle avoids conflicts ofinterests with respect to the position to be held, by having the personordering or requesting divestiture approve the vehicle. 3. Congress should consider whether the amendment should contain provisionsdealing with the following matters: (a) A minimum period of required government service after divestiture toqualify for deferral; (b) Requiring the appointee to defer gains or losses for all property withinthe class of divested property (<T3>e.g.,</T3> all energy stock), in order to prohibit the appointee fromrecognizing losses and deferring gains; (c) Permitting the appointee a second deferral on leaving government service(or within a brief period of time thereafter) if the appointee choosesto dispose of the neutral investment held during government service inorder to make another investment. 4. The Conference recognizes that other persons serving in the executivebranch may be ordered or requested to divest specific property in orderfor them to perform their duties free of actual or potential conflictsof interest, and believes that Congress should also consider, at the appropriatetime, whether to extend similar tax treatment to them. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;305.88-5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Agency Use of Settlement Judges (Recommendation 88-5). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Many cases over which administrative law judges, administrative judges,and other agency hearing officers preside do not involve broad regulatoryissues and are often appropriately resolved by settlement. Following inthe footsteps of several innovative federal judges,\1\<NOTE/> some administrative agencies have begun to provide additionalmechanisms for resolving these cases. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commissionand the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission have used a ``settlementjudge''_not the presiding judge in the case_to work with parties to explorepossibilities for consensual resolution. Other alternatives that agencieshave used include prehearing conferences and summary procedures,\2\<NOTE/> and more recently, minitrials, mediation and binding andnonbinding arbitrations.\3\<NOTE/> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\In addition to settlement conferences, courts have engagedin broad and growing use of other means for facilitating an early dispositionof a case including arbitration, special masters, mediators, and the useof summary jury trials. Rule 16(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedurewas amended in 1983 to provide that settlement and ``extrajudicial procedures''for resolving disputes are desirable and may be a subject at pretrial conferences,while subsection (f) of the rule provides for sanctions for failure toappear at, to be prepared for, and ``to participate in good faith'' atsuch conferences. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\<T3>See</T3> ACUS Recommendation 70-4(1) (urging presiding officers tohold prehearing conferences on own motion or at the request of the parties)and Recommendation 70-3 (summary decision). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\<T3>See</T3> ACUS Recommendation 86-3 (alternative means of dispute resolution)and Recommendation 87-11 (alternative means of dispute resolution in governmentcontract disputes). In both recommendations, use of settlement judges isspecifically recommended, 86-3(D), 87-11(d). <T3>See also</T3> Recommendation 72-4(D) (settlement of ratemaking cases).<ITAG tagnum="21">Agency prehearing conferences have historically been utilized as ameans for either settling an entire case or narrowing the issues. Today,some presiding judges are exceptionally effective at using these conferencesto promote settlement without overstepping bounds of proprietary. Still,while the presiding judge may be the ideal person to suggest that the partiestalk settlement in a reasonable manner, he or she often cannot help theparties' explorations in any comprehensive way without risking the appearanceof impropriety. In broad classes of cases, a separate settlement judge,not so limited, can exercise greater settlement-inducing authority thanthe presiding judge. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Conference does not intend to suggest that use of settlement judgesis a dispute resolution method that is necessarily better or worse thanadjudication, arbitration, minitrials, mediation by staff personnel ornongovernment mediators, or settlement by the presiding judge; partiesshould retain maximum flexibility to use the best procedure for their case.The best solution of all is to settle <T3>before</T3> an action has been instituted, and agencies should alsodo far more to instill consensual methods of dispute resolution into investigatory,preenforcement, and other stages. The settlement judge technique, nonetheless,is a useful means of facilitating settlements that, in appropriate adjudications,may be of greater value. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The settlement judge can command a degree of deference similar tothat of the presiding judge without the need to observe all of the commandsthat establish and maintain impartiality. A separate settlement judge,once appointed, can engage in ex parte and off-the-record conversations,frank assessments of the merits, and other techniques to aid settlementthat the presiding judge is less free to use. The settlement judge is generallyknowledgeable about the kind of case and the parties' interests, and isin a position to lend structure to the negotiations, control their pace,reduce the adversarial nature of the process, and help the parties to assessobjectively both the strengths and weaknesses of the case and to find reasonedsolutions. The settlement judge is familiar with how the presiding judgeis likely to handle such cases, how much time and effort they take, howevidence is weighed, and what kind of a reception the legal and factualissues will be given in light of agency precedent and policy. The settlementjudge, who carries a judge's power and authority, may greatly reduce thescope of parties' disagreements over likely outcomes. Parties also areless likely to be skeptical about the informal settlement judge processand more likely to view this device as a legitimate and potentially valuablemeans of reaching an enforceable, legally defensible settlement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Several other advantages may accrue. Initiating the settlement judgetechnique may be an excellent way for agencies to introduce the idea ofsettlement in proceedings in which it is not now frequently pursued butwhich the presence of other factors seems to make apt candidates. In suchcircumstances, an agency could make special efforts to make the techniqueavailable in the interest of breaking the adversarial mold, perhaps precededby siminars or other devices to permit its presiding judges to study mediation,negotiation and other settlement-inducing techniques. In individual cases,use of a settlement judge might lead the parties to turn to mediation orother non-adjudicatory means of pursuing a settlement agreement. Presidingjudges' experiences as settlement judges, and possible enhanced expertiseas mediators, should help them in resolving later cases.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Settlement judges are not a panacea, and their use must take intoaccount caseloads, possible abuses in exteme cases, and likelihood of success.The very potency of the judicial office means that it must be carefullyemployed to avoid abuse. Even so, the Conference sees great merit in thesettlement judge technique and urges that it receive much wider considerationand application as a means of actually settling matters, or convincingthe parties to undertake other consensual dispute resolution methods.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These recommendations suggest procedures for using the settlementjudge as a final effort to obviate formal proceedings, as well as guidelinesthat seek to increase potential gains in efficiency while minimizing possibleabuses that may result from a greater reliance on settlement in agencies'adjudicatory proceedings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendation</ITAG>A. <T3>Encouraging Use of Settlement Judges. </T3>1. As part of efforts toencourage use of consensual means of dispute resolution, federal agenciesthat decide cases presided over by administrative law judges, administrativejudges, or other hearing officers should encourage and facilitate settlementof adjudicatory proceedings by the voluntary use of settlement judges andother consensual methods.2. Agency offices of administrative law judges, boards of contract appeals,and other hearing offices should adopt rules for appropriate use of settlementjudges.3. In urging regularized and amplified utilization of settlement judges,the Administrative Conference has no intention of discouraging relianceon other methods of dispute resolution without recourse to formal procedures.In many instances, cases of the types deemed suitable for reference toa settlement judge (paragraph B, below) can and should be settled at preliminarystages of disagreement. At times, moreover, early recourse to mediationor arbitration (where authorized) may be appropriate.\4\<NOTE/> The Administrative Conference urges constant attention tosettlement possibilities long before a controversy has reached the docketof a trial judge.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>See </T3>Recommendation 86-3 and 87-11, <T3>id.</T3>B. <T3>Appropriate Cases. </T3>In general, the agency use of settlement judgesmay be appropriate where one, and particularly more than one, of the followingfactors appear.1. Crowded dockets with relatively few cases being settled.2. Presence of a large proportion of factual issues that are not of majorprecedential importance and do not raise broad policy or legal issues,particularly where the facts are undisputed and the primary issues concernthe interpretation or characterization of such facts.3. Remedies susceptible to gradation and, thus, to compromise. Examplesare money claims, rates,\5\<NOTE/> and degrees of restrictions or activity.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See </T3>Recommendation 72-4, <T3>supra</T3>, note 3.C. <T3>Administrative Issues.</T3> 1. The chief judge should retain discretionin assigning settlement judges on the basis of the situations, issues,judges' aptitudes and personalities, and so forth. He should also remainfree to refuse to appoint a settlement judge.2. The agency head should ordinarily not suggest use of a settlement judge,since he is much less likely to know when a particular case is suitablefor settlement and much more likely to desire a case to be settled to avoidhaving to decide it.3. Given the workload of presiding judges and possible limited availabilityfor appointment as a settlement judge, agencies should use, as an alternativesource of settlement judges, currently retired ALJs who have notified theOffice of Personnel Management that they would accept temporary appointment(pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3323(b), enacted in 1984), retired administrativejudges or hearing officers, or active hearing officers from another agency.4. Agency presiding judges, and especially chief judges, should regularlyreview their dockets to identify cases where use of settlement judges maybe useful, and consult regularly with experienced mediators to locate casesripe for settlement.5. Agencies should give attention to offering training in negotiation,mediation, and other consensual dispute resolution skills to administrativelaw judges, administrative judges, and other hearing officers. Trainingcourses or seminars should be developed by agencies jointly or in cooperationwith the Administrative Conference, Federal Mediation and ConciliationService, Board of Contract Appeals Judges Association, American Bar Association,or other professional organizations. Agencies should also work with otherinterested groups to sponsor similar programs or outreach sessions forrepresentatives who regularly appear in agency proceedings.D. <T3>Procedures.</T3> Agency regulations or guidelines implementing theuse of settlement judges should consider the following:1. <T3>Suggesting use of a settlement judge.</T3> (a) The suggestion thata settlement judge be consulted may be made to the agency's chief judgeby any party or by the presiding judge (although the agency head's invocationof the technique should be restrained (see C.2, above)). Because it willusually be difficult to predict at what points in the prehearing processsettlement will be possible, the presiding judge and the parties shouldbe free to request appointment of a settlement judge at any time. Any partyor the presiding judge may veto such a suggestion.(b) The chief judge should seek to ensure that all parties who appear <T3>pro se </T3>consent knowingly and voluntarily before he decides toinvoke the aid of a settlement judge.2. <T3>Appointment. </T3>(a) When appointing a settlement judge, the chiefjudge should issue an order specifying the length of time for such negotiationsand confining the scope of any settlement negotiations to specified issues.(b) When a settlement judge is appointed, the presiding judge may suspenddiscovery or other proceedings during the time the matter is assigned tothe settlement judge.(c) If settlement negotiations are terminated, the chief judge may subsequentlyappoint a settlement judge in the same proceeding to conduct further negotiations.(d) To ensure that proceedings are not unnecessarily interrupted, agencyregulations or guidelines should provide that any decision concerning theappointment of a settlement judge or termination of settlement negotiationsis not subject to review or rehearing.3. <T3>Conduct of negotiations. </T3>(a) The regulations should afford thesettlement judge broad authority to:(1) Confer with the parties on the subject of whole or partial settlement,(2) Suggest privately to a party's representative what concessions be consideredby the party,(3) Assess privately with each representative the reasonableness of theparty's case or settlement position,(4) Facilitate communications between the parties,(5) Mediate,(6) Seek resolution of as many issues in the case as is feasible, and(7) Recommend use of minitrials, mediation, factfinding, or other consensualresolution means, and, if the parties genuinely wish some method of presentingevidence in a settlement context or having the dispute mediated, the settlementjudge should be free to refer them to a separate minitrial or mediationprocess.(b) To increase the likelihood of settlement, the regulations should:(1) Provide that the settlement judge may recommend that the representativewho is expected to try the case be present at a settlement conference andthat the parties, or their agents having full settlement authority, bepresent.(2) Set forth specific guidelines for conducting settlement conferences(including by telephone) where appropriate.(3) Exhort all parties and their representatives to be candid with thesettlement judge so that he may properly guide settlement discussions.(4) Provide the settlement judge with flexibility to impose any additionalrequirements proper to expedite resolution of the case.(c) The settlement judge should, within days after appointment, meet ortalk with the parties together and (usually) separately to determine whatobstructs settlement. Proceedings before a settlement judge should notordinarily be lengthy or elaborate.4. <T3>Confidentiality. </T3>(a) To encourage the candor often necessary toachieve a settlement, the regulations should provide that no evidence ofstatements or conduct by parties, counsel or settlement judge in the settlementproceedings shall be admissible in any subsequent hearing, except by stipulationof the parties. The regulations should further provide that documents disclosedin a settlement process may not be used in litigation unless obtained byappropriate discovery or subpoena. Agencies should provide sanctions againstany violators.(b) The regulations should prohibit the settlement judge from discussingthe merits of the case with the presiding judge or any other person \6\<NOTE/> and preclude the settlement judge from being called as awitness in any hearing of the case.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ This should not prevent judges within the same officefrom engaging in discussions of settlement or mediation techniques thatmay aid the settlement judge in resolving particular cases and assist ina judge's professional development.5. <T3>Settlement and reports. </T3>(a) At the conclusion of the settlementprocedures, either the parties should tell the presiding judge that theyhave settled, or the settlement judge should advise the trial judge, withoutelaboration, that settlement has not been reached. The report should notattribute any view to any party or assess any positions taken. The agency'sregulations should describe the method by which the presiding judge isadvised that settlement has not been reached.(b) To protect against unnecessary delay, the settlement judge's firstreport should be made within a specified period after appointment. Theagency head or chief judge should be authorized to order additional reportsat any time.(c) In reporting, the settlement judge may recommend the termination orcontinuation of settlement negotiations.(d) A settlement arrived at with the help of a settlement judge shouldbe treated like any other settlement.6. New andSection; 310.13 is added to Part 310, to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 310.13 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Statement on Dispute Resolution Procedure in Reparations and SimilarCases.</ITAG>Where Congress has established private rights, effective means of protectingthem are crucial. Congress has used a variety of procedures to protectconsumers, workers and certain others. In many cases, it has establishedformal adjudicatory process (e.g., within regulatory agencies like theFederal Trade Commission or review agencies like the Occupational Safetyand Health Review Commission). Congress has also recognized that, in manycases, formal agency hearings or court litigation may be unnecessary ortoo costly. Thus, alternative or supplementary agency procedures or evenprivate-sector procedures have been established to resolve disputes thatformerly would have been left to the formal adjudication process.Agencies' use and oversight of these dispute processes has become evenmore important in light of recent congressional developments and SupremeCourt decisions. The Supreme Court recognized in <T3>Shearson/American Express, Inc. v. McMahon, </T3>107 Sup. Ct. 2332(1987), for example, that arbitration processes are often adequate to protectstatutory rights, particularly where an agency can oversee their operationto ensure their adequacy. Indeed, that case enforced an arbitration agreementeven for a treble damage case brought under the Racketeer Influenced andCorrupt Organizations Act by a plaintiff acting much like a ``private attorneygeneral.''Agencies' approaches to ``reparations'' and similar programs to safeguardconsumers reflect the diversity of approaches that are available. The Securitiesand Exchange Commission, so far at least, has relied on a purely privateresolution mechanism_exchange-based arbitration. The Commodity FuturesTrading Commission (``CFTC''), has developed, pursuant to statutory mandate,its own distinctive dispute resolution program. Since it was formed in1974, the CFTC has administered a ``reparations'' program that adjudicatesbetween commodity futures salespersons (known as ``futures commission merchants'')and aggrieved customers.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Other agencies, like the Federal Maritime Commission andthe U.S. Department of Agriculture, have reparations programs that differin significant respects.The CFTC's program provides an interesting alternative to civil litigation,formal hearings under the Administrative Procedure Act, and commercialarbitration.\2\<NOTE/> Like arbitration (which is also an option available to aggrievedcustomers), the reparations program uses decisionmakers familiar with theindustry from which the disputes arise. But these decisionmakers are CFTCemployees, rather than arbitrators drawn from industry_either agency administrativelaw judges or other specially-designated agency employees known as ``judgmentofficers''. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Persons with reparations claims may pursue several otheravenues of redress (National Futures Association arbitration, private suits),so the entire CFTC program is in essence voluntary. The CFTC has been creative in fashioning procedures for the reparationsprogram. The ``formal'' procedure, for claims of more than $10,000, isakin to the adjudicatory procedure provided in section 554 of the APA.The ``summary'' procedure for claims under $10,000 dispenses with severalformalities, including the right to an oral hearing. It does permit a telephonichearing. A third, ``voluntary'' procedure, is available for claims of anysize and must be elected by both parties. It dispenses with a written opinionby the presiding judgment officer and appeal rights. While the CFTC's programhad a troubled early history, characterized at times by crippling casebacklogs and severe budgetary constraints, recent years have seen enhancedresources and a considerable improvement in case management. The Administrative Conference has begun exploring these processes withits research into the CFTC's innovative approach to consumer protection.The Conference sees important benefit in programs, like the CFTC's, thatoffer complainants procedural options. Creation of an agency review processfor consumer complaints benefits the regulatory agency because the processprovides a valuable pipeline into the problems of the industry; resolvingthese complaints serves as a constant challenge and impetus to the agencyto interpret its statutory mandate. A three-tiered approach like the CFTC'spermits added opportunities for procedural tailoring. On the other hand,the parallel private decisional process may be less expensive, faster,and more responsive. Parties benefit from having both a choice of forumsand an opportunity to select a dispute resolution procedure that suitstheir needs. Much remains to be done in considering the best approach for particularagencies, and this statement is intended as an initial foray. The AdministrativeConference suggests that continued experimentation with alternative typesof procedures for resolving issues arising in consumer protection programsis justified. Agencies administering statutes that recognize a privateright of action should consider establishing, or seeking authority to establish,a reparations program offering creative procedures for ``formal,'' ``summary''and ``voluntary'' dispute resolution, along the lines of the CFTC's where:(1) An agency statute provides for and engenders substantial private litigationand/or arbitration; or (2) An agency regulatory program centers on a single industry or groupof similar industries, such as would permit creation of ``expert'' decisionmakers.An agency with both of the characteristics listed above would be a primecandidate for a reparations program. Each program of course would be craftedto meet the special needs of the agency's particular regulatory jurisdiction.Management of reparations programs should take into account these factors:(1) Where complaints are to be resolved by summary or voluntary procedures,the discovery process should be streamlined to comport with the goals ofless formal procedures. For example, the number of interrogatories andrequests for admissions may be substantially limited; and summary informationrather than facsimiles could be deemed responsive to requests for the productionof documents. (2) The judgment officers used in summary and voluntary procedures neednot always be administrative law judges or even attorneys, so long as theydemonstrate sufficient experience in, or knowledge of, the regulated industryor applicable law. (3) While summary procedures by their nature may not require an in-personhearing, telephone hearings may provide a useful and inexpensive way ofallowing the judgment officer to question parties and witnesses. Telephonehearings should be available whenever a judgment officer believes sucha hearing is appropriate to the resolution of a dispute. (4) Since complainants in reparations proceedings frequently appear withouta lawyer, agencies should make the dispute resolution process understandableto the lay person. Toward that end, notices and descriptions of the processshould avoid whenever possible the use of legal terms (e.g., ``pleadings''or ``discovery'') where a colloquial term will suffice. Where use of alay term would mislead, or where no appropriate term is available, agenciesshould make every effort to assure that the legal term of art has beentranslated for the lay party or even provide a glossary of such terms forthe benefit of the lay reader. (5) Managers should assure that a sufficient number of judgment officersare employed to reduce the overall processing time for summary and voluntaryproceedings, and thus to permit those forms of procedure to fulfill theirpromise. (6) Case tracking systems for reparations cases should be used, or modernized,so that the location and progress of any case can be quickly identifiedand bottlenecks eliminated. <ITAG tagnum="6">Jeffrey S.
