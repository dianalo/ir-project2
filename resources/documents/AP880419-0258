Last month, the company _ which officially becomes the FirstCity Acquisition Corp. under the plan _ lowered the requiredparticipation level from 90 percent to 70 percent.   In making today's announcement, however, company officialsdeclined to confirm that senior and subordinated debt holders hadsurrendered 70 percent of the bank holding company's debt.   First City officials announced last week they planned tocomplete the deal by today. A Monday afternoon deadline, thecompany's sixth, passed without word from First City on whether thecompany had completed the last obstacle to finish thereorganization plan.   As of last week, 66.1 percent, or $149.3 million, of the bank's$225.8 million in bonds had been tendered. First City needs atleast $158 million of the outstanding debt tendered to complete thedeal.   Chicago investor A. Robert Abboud's effort to rescueHouston-based First City with the help of $970 million from theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. has been slowed by bondholders'reluctance to part with the debt.   First City senior debt holders have been offered 45 cents on thedollar for their debt, while subordinated debt holders have beenoffered 35 cents.   Bonds not tendered by the deadline become the obligation of therevitalized First City and would be worth more than what Abboud isoffering.   The bailout plan, announced in September, calls for $970 millionin assistance from the FDIC, a spinoff of $1.79 billion in bookvalue of poorly performing assets and $500 million infusion ofcapital raised privately by a group headed by Abboud.   Also on Monday, CNN Business News reported that Abboud hasagreed to put up more than $500 million in private money throughnew stock underwritten by Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette SecuritiesCorp. The report said Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has pledged $100million _ under certain conditions _ as part of that sum.   A First City spokesman said he was not aware of Drexel BurnhamLambert's involvment with Abboud. Calls to the New York investmentcompany from The Associated Press were not returned.   First City, with 59 banks in Texas and one in South Dakota, grewquickly during the Texas oil boom, but was hit by energy and realestate losses when oil prices plummeted.   For 1987, the state's fourth-largest bank holding company posteda $1.1 billion loss.   In a 10K report filed late last month with the Securities andExchange Commission, First City reported it expected to lose $43million by the time the reorganization is completed.   If the First City doesn't redeem enough bonds, the FDIC says itwill resort to an alternative that will hurt bondholders more thanAbboud's proposal.   The FDIC won't say what the alternatives are, but analystssuspect the agency would declare First City insolvent, seize itunder its emergency powers and then turn it over to Abboud. If thathappens, bondholders would get wiped out.   Another alternative would be to declare First City bankrupt andnegotiate with bondholders in court.</TEXT></DOC>
