Also, four family members found work -- twoas carpenters and two as strawberry pickers.;    Food and $1,000 donated; &quot;We're very happy. I can't thank people enough,&quot; said Virginia Beranza, the42-year-old spokeswoman for the family, which includes her husband, herchildren, brother, sisters, nieces, nephews and grandchildren.;    In additionto the house and jobs, the family received donations of more than 500 poundsof food and $1,000, said Jonathan Pray, the pastor of the First Baptist Churchof San Martin.;    &quot;The response has been unbelievable,&quot; Pray said.;   Beranza said family members plan to live in the donated house on FlorenceAvenue until they see if they qualify for low-income rental housing. Theyeventually want to buy houses in their native Mexican state of Veracruz. Theinability to save enough money there is what brought the clan to the UnitedStates in May 1988.;    Two years of good luck;  The adults quickly found workwith a San Martin farmer, who grew strawberries, peppers and cucumbers. Theymoved into a makeshift labor camp on the farmer's property, and the childrenattended school in San Martin.;    All went well for two years. But divorceproceedings begun last summer by the farmer and his wife resulted in propertydisputes that left the Beranza clan with sporadic paychecks. A laborcommissioner has awarded 10 members of the family between $25,000 and $30,000in back wages, but they have been unable to collect.;    Near the end of 1990,county health authorities closed the labor camp because of multiple codeviolations. The Beranza family moved to a county labor camp in Gilroy, but inFebruary the camp was closed for its annual repair that gets it ready forharvest crews arriving in May.;    When the family left Gilroy, it was takenin by the First Baptist Church of San Martin.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DALE RODEBAUGH, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  South County  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910430  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  398  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday April 30, 199100121215,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
