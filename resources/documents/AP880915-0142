Hurricane Gilbert, which has left nearly one in four Jamaicanshomeless, slackened somewhat as it swirled over land, but the stormwas beginning to gain strength over open water as it moved towardthe U.S. Gulf Coast with sustained winds of 120 mph.   The storm was headed west northwest, said National HurricaneCenter director Bob Sheets. It was moving at 15 mph and dumping upto 10 inches of rain.   ``The area that we have the most likely possibility that thishurricane will make landfall is in the northern part of Mexico orthe southeastern, southern part of Texas,'' he said.   At 3 p.m. today, the center of the storm was near latitude 22.3north and longitude 92.9 west, or about 380 miles southeast ofBrownsville, Texas, the National Weather Service said.   Brownsville was given a 21 percent probability of being hit,though a hurricane watch was in effect along the entire Texas coastas well as the northeastern Mexican coast from Tampico.   Earlier this week the storm struck the Carribean, ravagingJamaica, the Dominican Repubic, the Cayman Islands and Haiti,killing at least 19 in Jamaica and five in the Dominican Republic.   Haiti declared a state of emergency across its southernpeninsula, where at least 10 hurricane-related deaths have beenreported.   The storm, about 450 miles wide, hit the Yucatan coast at dawnWednesday, thrashing beaches with 23-foot waves, uprooting trees,knocking out electricity and water supplies and severing telephonelines.   Mexican officials reported at least seven injuries. There wereno reports of deaths.   Gilbert battered the provincial capital of Merida and the gulfport cities of Puerto Progreso, Campeche and Ciudad del Carmen,closing airports and roads and knocking out communications andpower and innundating streets and highways.   About 20,000 people were evacuated from Puerto Progreso andother coastal towns, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry inMexico City said by telephone today. Hundreds of homes weredestroyed, he said.   The ministry said the storm seriously damaged the luxury hotelzone in the resort of Cancun and destroyed about a quarter of thehomes on the nearby island of Cozumel. Ham radio operators inMexico City also told The Associated Press they had reports ofmassive damage to several hotels.   Authorities were particularly concerned about the people trappedon another resort island just off Cancun, tiny Isla Mujeres.   A navy spokesman in Mexico City said he had no word on theplight of an estimated 15,000 people stranded there. Three ferrieslinking the island with the mainland were lost in the storm, butthere were no reports of casualties.   In Campeche, boats were driven onto the street running along thewaterfront, Ramon Castillo, a night watchman at the newspaperNovedades of Campeche, said in a telephone interview.   ``There is no light, there is no radio, there is nothing. Thereis much damage. The whole city is flooded,'' he said.   Sheets said the hurricane was expected to hit land midday Fridayand that its sustained winds would today ``certainly increase to130, 140 miles per hour.''   ``It's going to have an impact over a fairly large area,''Sheets said on CBS-TV's ``This Morning.''   ``Those major destructive winds are going to be in there fairlytight close to the center. But the impacts are going to be feltover most of the Texas area.''   The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm onrecord in terms of barometric pressure, which was measured at 26.31inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricanethat devastated the Florida Keys.   In the Yucatan state capital of Merida, the storm's 160 mphwinds destroyed nearly all the thatched houses in one district,uprooted trees, road signs and cut off water supplies, saidGonzalez Correa, news editor of Novedades.   A spokeswoman with the National Civil Defense System in MexicoCity said at least 20,000 people had flocked to Merida from coastalareas.   Civil defense officials said 6,000 tourists left beachsidemotels and 30,000 local people also sought temporary shelter. U.S.consular officials said they did not know how many tourists were inCancun, which receives about 50,000 visitors per month.   The storm, spawned Saturday southeast of Puerto Rico, appearedto have hit Jamaica the hardest. That island nation's primeminister, Edward Seaga, said Wednesday that it destroyed about100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes. He estimated damage at $8billion.   Earlier Wednesday, Gilbert was classified as a Category 5 storm,the strongest and deadliest type of hurricane. Such storms havemaximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can causecatastrophic damage.   By Wednesday night, the National Hurricane Center downgraded itto a Category 4 and to a Category 3 by this morning.   Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States _ the1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida and Hurricane Camille,which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed 256people.</TEXT></DOC>
