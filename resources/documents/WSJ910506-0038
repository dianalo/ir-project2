At a political rally in a vastsoccer stadium, he sits under a huge red banner proclaiminghis area of the grandstand to be Karl Marx Zone.   So, what does Mr. Ngcobo think of what has become of KarlMarx lately?</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I wouldn't know,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't know him personally.&quot;   The 19-year-old student, a newly enlisted Communist, scansthe crowd of 50,000 people rallying for the African NationalCongress. &quot;Karl Marx must be here somewhere. You must askaround.&quot;   Karl Marx himself didn't make the rally. (&quot;He's dead?,&quot;sputters Mr. Ngcobo.) But his restless ghost is here, allright.   &quot;Realize socialism,&quot; urges the scribbling on a miner'shardhat. &quot;Build the workers' vanguard,&quot; encourages a bannerdraped across some scaffolding. &quot;Long Live the South AfricanCommunist Party,&quot; prays the pin of an old man.   They may be tearing up the Communist Manifesto in EasternEurope and in some African nations north of here. But on thecontinent's southern tip, where Communists are no longerbanned, the working class is just beginning to discover KarlMarx. Or at least they think they are.   &quot;I know Karl Marx,&quot; offers a man sitting next to Mr.Ngcobo. &quot;He's a South African, isn't he? But can you tell me,is Karl Marx white or black?&quot;   When Pretoria last February ended its 40-year ban on theSouth African Communist Party, known as the SACP, it reckonedthat the crumbling of communism elsewhere would soondiscredit the party here. Instead, Communists have beenstreaming back from exile and coming out of the closetinternally to organize Africa's largest industrializedworking class, which has remained largely oblivious to thechanges in the rest of the world.   On factory floors, in the mines and throughout thesimmering, overcrowded black townships, workers talk of thetwo-phase revolution: first, black liberation from whitedomination, and then the creation of a thoroughly socialiststate. The view from here is that it is apartheid -- and itsperceived cohort in racial oppression, capitalism -- that hasfailed, not communism. In fact, through its longrevolutionary alliance with the African National Congress,the main black liberation group, the SACP is more popular nowthan when it was banned.   &quot;The working class in Eastern Europe is confused,&quot; saysMoses Mayekiso. &quot;I worry about {the Polish people} reversingall the revolutionary gains.&quot;   Mr. Mayekiso is a top official in one of South Africa'slargest black unions, the National Union of Metalworkers. Heis also on the SACP's leadership committee. Several yearsago, in between stints in jail for his anti-apartheidactivism, Mr. Mayekiso went to Poland to attend a Solidaritytrade union conference. He couldn't believe his working-classears.   &quot;I found it difficult for workers to say they want afree-market system without qualifying it in any way. When Ihear this, then I must say `These people don't know what theywant.'&quot; Mr. Mayekiso says. &quot;They will burn their fingersquickly on capitalism. They will realize there isunemployment and poverty.&quot;   The 40-year-old unionist gives his beard a troubled tug.It was Poland's state bureaucracy that &quot;demoralized theworkers, and they have run to an extremist alternative,&quot; saysMr. Mayekiso, who grew up reading the banned works of Marxand Lenin and now rigidly quotes them. &quot;They shoulddemocraticize socialism, rather than kiss Thatcherism.&quot;   This is the South African Communist's answer to therealities of Eastern Europe: It isn't communism that failed,but the way it was implemented. The SACP, once one of themost Stalinist of the world's Communist fraternities, hasundergone its own perestroika and now favors multipartydemocracy, regular elections, independent unions and enoughelements of free enterprise to keep foreign investorsinterested. They call this &quot;scientific socialism.&quot; But theirgoal is the same as ever, to enter government through thealliance with the ANC and then work to establish aproletarian paradise where the workers will controleverything, from investment decisions to production planning.   Joe Slovo, the pudgy and avuncular head of the SACP, hascertainly been on a roll ever since he returned wearing redsocks from three decades in exile. Once described by a localpundit as a cross between Joseph Stalin and Santa Claus, Mr.Slovo was acting more like Rodney Dangerfield one night at apolitical talk show in a Johannesburg nightclub:   There's this man, see, who is being beaten up by apoliceman. He shouts, &quot;Stop] Stop] I'm an anti-communist.&quot;But the policeman continues hitting him. &quot;I don't care,&quot; saysthe cop, &quot;what kind of bloody Communist you are.&quot;   Mr. Slovo, a 64-year-old white lawyer who was born inLithuania, joins the audience in laughing at his joke, andthen adds, &quot;To be a Communist in this country takes more thana sense of humor. . . . It takes a sense of survival.&quot;   White, capitalist South Africa pokes fun at the survivalof communism here. The SACP, says satirist Pieter-Dirk Uys,is &quot;the only Communist party in the world with a plan for thefuture.&quot; One newspaper editor refers to Mr. Slovo as &quot;thelast Lithuanian Communist.&quot;   But many restless young blacks see Mr. Slovo and theCommunists as upholding the revolutionary edge of theANC-SACP alliance. While top ANC leaders who aren'tCommunists, such as Nelson Mandela, have been striking a moremoderate pose, those leaders who also belong to the SACP,particularly the commanders of the ANC's military wing,continue to rattle the revolutionary sabres.   &quot;We can't go to sleep just because we have been unbanned,&quot;says Jeremy Cronin. &quot;We need to keep on promoting socialism.&quot;Mr. Cronin, a mild-mannered white poet, burrowed into theSACP underground during his university days. He was arrestedand jailed for seven years, and then went into exile. Now 40,he directs the party's education efforts.   Speaking before 1,000 students at Johannesburg'sUniversity of the Witwatersrand, he nimbly parries hostilequestions about communism's shortcomings by ticking off alist of African countries where, he implies, capitalism hasbuilt societies that are far less than perfect. Most of theaudience loves it, particularly when he asks what capitalismhas done to improve the lot of South Africa's working class.   &quot;He's right,&quot; says Freddie Mokhachane, a 24-year-old blackstudent. &quot;Capitalism may succeed in the U.S. and Germany, butI know what I know. My father has worked for 20 years in afactory and has nothing, not even a house. Now, is thatsuccessful capitalism?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
