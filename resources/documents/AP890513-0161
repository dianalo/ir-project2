MARTINEZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There's a three-syllable word Wall Streetanalysts are bandying around to describe the stock market's ficklemood: ``conviction.''   It's something they say the market _ or, rather, investors _don't have a whole lot of lately.   Take, for example, the April report on producer prices. Themarket waited all week for Friday's data while traders talked ofhigher inflation and gloomy predictions of a recession.   In the first 30 minutes after the opening bell, the Dow Jonesindustrial average zoomed over 40 points, and remained near thatlevel during most of the day. Traders had been expecting a numberhigher than the 0.4 percent rise the Labor Department reported.   The Dow average closed 56.82 points higher Friday at 2,439.70,the highest level since the October 1987 stock market collapse andthe biggest daily gain since a 74.68-point rise on May 31, 1988.   The previous post-crash high was 2,418.99 at the close on April27. The 57.74-point gain for the week was the third-best this year.   Among other barometers, the New York Stock Exchange compositeindex rose 2.99 for the week to 175.13,; the NASDAQ composite indexfor the over-the-counter market rose 4.12 to 434.83; and theAmerican Stock Exchange market value index edged up 1.46 to 348.30.   It seems, as one analyst put it, that investors are living anddying on each piece of economic data shoveled out by the government_ old data at that.   ``The biggest problem the market faces is confusion and lack ofconviction because of confusion,'' says Alfred E. Goldman, vicepresident of the investment firm A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. ``Itshows this market has little long-term conviction. Otherwise peoplewouldn't be so concerned with old news.''   Traders and the investing public hoped the numbers would unravelthe previous week's confusion over the April employment report. Thereport showed more people were out of work _ an indication theeconomy might be slowing, while hourly earnings rose a substantial7 cents _ hinting inflation's tentacles might be stretching.   The jitters early in the week were reflected in the measlyvolume. Despite 221.49 million shares traded on Friday, the week'svolume averaged just 160.87 million shares a day, down from 163.25million the week before.   No sooner had some of the excitement died down than traders weretalking about the upcoming consumer price data, another measure ofinflation that some said might not produce the same favorableresults.   ``People want to keep the economy from overheating. But we keepgetting mixed signals,'' says Thomas Walsh, head of equity tradingat Nikko Securities International. ``It's a critical period in avery fickle market _ a market with little conviction.''   The critical period amounts to a turning point in the economy,according to some economists.   With no clear-cut, long-term direction, the market is relying onshort-term measurements to give it a jolt even though, as oneexpert put it, gambling on the PPI doesn't determine the value of acompany.   ``Even though there is no conviction with the market trend, it'sdifficult (for traders) to explain to clients why they haven'tparticipated in the last 200 to 300 points,'' said Eugene Peroni,technical analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott. ``It's aself-fulfilling thing. The market begins to gain steam and itpressures those underweighted in equities to come in and commitfunds.''   Early in the week, the focus was on the Dow Jones industrialaverage and an eight-day losing streak, even though the averagelost less over the eight sessions than it often has in one day.   The explanation for the consecutive losses: ``It's no calamity,just a lack of conviction,'' said Larry Wachtel, analyst withPrudential-Bache Securities Inc.   Despite the overall uncertainty, some Wall Street analystsbelieve ingredients are accumulating for a strong upward move inthe next 12 months. Money managers and large institutionalinvestors are moving into the market in an orderly fashion, theysay.   ``The economy is at a turning point,'' said James Solloway,director of economic research at Argus Research Corp. ``That's whyinvestors and traders are keying on each statistic. They want tocatch the turning point.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for weekend editions May 13-14.</NOTE></DOC>
