This study constituteda preliminary step in determining which sources, technologies and applicationsmay be appropriate in Canada, and when and under what conditions theymight be technically and economically viable. Principal sources of renewableenergy (solar radiation, wind and biomass), as well as waves, thermalgradients and sensible heat sources are reviewed to establish, in generalterms, their significance in the Canadian context. Next, the technicalcharacteristics, efficiency, costs, impacts and state-of-the-art of sixteenharnessing or conversion technologies are presented as an informationbase upon which to build an assessment of potential. A method of comparingthe life cost of a renewable energy system to that of the likely conventionalalternative is proposed and applied in cases where adequate technicaland economic data are available. A variety of different economic assumptionsare also outlined under which the renewable systems would be cost competitive.This costing methodology is applied in detail to four case studies: residentialsolar space and water heating, photovoltaics, residential, a 200 kW windgenerator, and anaerobic digestion of livestock wastes. Finally, thepotential for renewable energy approaches in Canada is explored and evaluatedfrom three perspectives: technical viability, economic viability andimplementation. 319 refs., 18 figs., 94 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
