(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Textron Aerostructures has received itssecond big European Airbus award in three months, a $500 millioncontract to build wing components for commerical jetliners,officials said.   ``The capture of this contract helps solidify our position inthe commercial aircraft industry worldwide,'' said John S. Kleban,president of Texron Aerostructures.   Textron Aerostructures, a subsidiary of the Providence,R.I.-based Textron, was selected by Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm'sTransport Aircraft Division to build wing parts for the EuropeanAirbus A330 and A340 program. MBB is West Germany's largestaerospace company.   The award makes Textron Aerostructures the major U.S. supplierfor the A330 and A340 series of Airbus commercial jetliners.   Airbus Industrie, based in Toulouse, France, is a consortium ofEurope's largest aircraft makers.   On May 12, Textron Aerostructures announced another $700 millionAirbus wing component contract from British Aerospace.   The contracts, however, will replace relatively few of the 4,400jobs lost at the Nashville plant since 1986, after the completionof the B-1B and Lockheed's C-58 program, the company said.   Under the MMB contract, Aerospace will provide engineeringdesign support, development, tooling and production of outer flaps,spoilers and flap track fairings.   The agreement will require Textron to invest $3 million inequipment to produce the wing components. Production deliveries arescheduled to begin in early 1991 and build to a rate of sevenassemblies per month by October 1993.   The A330 is a twin-engine airliner with a high seating capacityfor service on medium- and long-range routes of up to 5,100nautical miles. The A340 is a four-engine widebody with a range ofup to 7,850 nautical miles. Both aircraft have identical wings andsystems.</TEXT></DOC>
