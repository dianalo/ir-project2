Christopher Cox</HL><DD> 01/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FRESTPUBLISHING (PUB) </IN><TEXT>   Ever since Mikhail Gorbachev came to power, Kremlinologists have strained to detect evidence of a new candor -- glasnost -- in the reporting of news. Alas, if candid means honest, the Soviet news media hardly qualify. In repeated articles on the subject, for example, Pravda has told its claimed 50 million readers that AIDS is likely the product of sinister CIA and FBI experiments on jailed political prisoners. Pravda's reporting of Chernobyl was wrenched from the party only after three weeks of international outrage. Even then, Mr. Gorbachev himself broke the silence with nothing less than a propaganda barrage, denouncing the West for producing a &quot;mountain of lies&quot; about the accident.    Moreover, the &quot;news&quot; stories that finally followed the nuclear disaster were disingenuous at best. In one article, titled &quot;Souvenirs From Under the Reactor,&quot; contented workers told of their &quot;deeply satisfying&quot; chores at the reactor core (where, according to independent sources, robots had malfunctioned and unwilling humans were conscripted for the grisly task).    One worker offered the Pravda correspondents two small stones he had chipped away from the reactor base. &quot;'Take these as souvenirs,' he said, handing the chips to us. 'Soon the spot where we are standing now will be filled (with concrete), and nobody will ever be able to touch the base of the reactor.'&quot; The Soviet Union's leading daily deadpanned this vignette as implicit evidence that the radioactivity at Chernobyl was hardly a danger to anyone.    Within the confines of the Marxist intellectual construct, it is perfectly legitimate for the New York Times of the Soviet Union to fabricate a story on AIDS or to dust Chernobyl under the rug in order to suit the party's ends. In a May 5, 1986, article, Pravda set forth the doctrinal basis for the Soviet state's continued total control of the media and the subordination of factual reporting to the objectives of the state: &quot;The party considers television, radio, and the press as a powerful instrument of publicity and social control. . . . True to Leninist precepts, the Soviet press serves as a collective propagandist, agitator and organizer of the masses.&quot;    Ironically, one of the most telling indications that glasnost is merely another tool in the implementation of the party's strategy came in the course of a propaganda effort designed to prove how open and self-critical the Soviet government is. Last August, Pravda published a half-dozen letters to the editor from high school seniors at a girls' school in Palm Beach, Fla. The students had read the paper in English translation and then written to Moscow as part of a class project.    Most of these letters were, in the words of the girls' journalism teacher, &quot;utterly critical&quot; of the Soviet state or of the newspaper itself. According to the Palm Beach Post, however, much of the criticism in the students' letters got waylaid between the Florida coast and Pravda's pages. One student, whose letter as printed extolled the Soviet Union as the &quot;first country of socialism,&quot; was quoted by the Post as saying: &quot;I don't think I said that.&quot;    Pravda ran the censored letters under the banner headline &quot;Letters From Florida&quot; and undoubtedly expected big propaganda points as a result. At first, it looked as if the Russians had scored. Soviet experts in the U.S. opined that the printing of the American students' letters was a highly unusual event, noting that in the past Americans has been quoted only for purposes of criticizing the U.S. or achieving similar partisan ends. One such expert stated it clearly: Publication of the American students' letters was further evidence that &quot;Gorbachev has asked for a new outspokenness.&quot;    Following the press reports in the U.S. that the letters had been censored or altered, however, the Soviets were quick to react. In its Dec. 8, 1986, edition, Pravda ran another banner-headline story, this one entitled &quot;Girls From Palm Beach Surprised.&quot; The article bluntly emphasized the propaganda points that were meant to be so subtly made by the original publication of the students' letters. Stating that the Americans were pleasantly surprised to see their letters in Pravda, the Soviets flatly asserted that all of the letters were printed in full, and concluded that &quot;publication of the letters from Florida in their entirety destroyed another false concept . . . that criticism is not allowed in Soviet newspapers.&quot;    The paper then set out to attack the Post article and reporter for allegedly attempting, with the help of Soviet experts from the local university, to &quot;restore the shaken myth about the absence of criticism in the Soviet press.&quot; According to Pravda, by &quot;questioning the professional ethics of Soviet journalists,&quot; the Post &quot;put its foot in its mouth.&quot;    Pravda did not stop there. The Soviets misrepresented the Post story by implying that the Florida paper had questioned the accuracy of the independent English translation of Pravda, from whose publishers the Soviets were quick to distance themselves. &quot;The fact is that the translation and publication of Pravda in the U.S.A. is handled by a commercial organization that has no business -- let alone political-relation to the publishers of the original. So all potential claims, as lawyers say, should be directed to the American publisher of Pravda.&quot;    This was a red herring of the first order. Pravda, not the Post, raised the prospect that the alleged censorship occurred during the translation into English rather than into Russian. In fact, the Florida paper had had the letters translated into English for review by the students and then reported their reactions. Blaming the missing criticism on the independent American translators was Pravda's own invention.    As it happens, the independent American translators of Pravda to whom the Soviets referred are Associated Publishers Inc., a small firm in St. Paul, Minn., that I helped found in 1984. The Russian-language scholars at Associated Publishers are adamant that their English translation of the original &quot;Letters From Florida&quot; was accurate in every detail. Indeed, the Soviets -- who have read many if not all of the daily translations -- know this. But the ingrained bad habits of a totally controlled press proved difficult to break in the face of unaccustomed scrutiny of Pravda's pages by the free press of the West, and the party's editors found quick refuge in distortion and fabrication to establish the point they had set out to make.    The Post was right on target in questioning the professional ethics of Soviet &quot;journalists.&quot; Indeed, it would serve us all well to consider the claims of a new Soviet &quot;openness&quot; with these events in mind.    ---   Mr. Cox is a Washington lawyer. </TEXT></DOC>
