Republican congressional leaders met with the president and strongly urged him to sign the measure, which would raise the federal borrowing limit and require $23 billion in deficit cuts for the coming fiscal year. But the president wouldn't give in, saying the measure could force him to choose between defense spending cuts and tax increases, both of which he opposes.    &quot;I just don't know,&quot; Senate Minority Whip Alan Simpson said when asked which way the president might go. He said the president listened &quot;intently&quot; to the GOP leaders. According to others at the meeting, the president told the group he was still undecided.    A veto of the bill would reduce the chances of any deficit reduction next year and would also raise the possibility of an unprecedented government default. The government's borrowing authority expired at midnight Wednesday, and unless a new debt ceiling is enacted soon, the government will be unable to redeem more than $40 billion in Treasury bills and notes that come due Sept. 30 and Oct. 1.    The Treasury announced yesterday that because of the expired debt limit it is suspending sales of U.S. savings bonds and the special securities it sells to state and local governments. The department also redeemed $13.1 billion in Treasury bills with cash yesterday, because it was unable to hold a new bill auction this week.    The president's advisers are deeply split on the budget issue. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz have recommended a veto, officials say, because they fear the law would force large cuts in the defense and foreign affairs budgets.    But other officials, including Treasury Secretary James Baker, Budget Director James Miller and White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker, are urging Mr. Reagan to sign the measure. They say a veto of the deficit-cutting law would have serious political repercussions and could roil the financial markets.    &quot;He's heard views from everyone, and now he's got to decide,&quot; said Mr. Miller. &quot;But if someone puts him in a box, he's not necessarily going to take it. The man makes up his own mind.&quot;    Appearing on NBC-TV's &quot;Today&quot; program, Treasury Secretary Baker said &quot;it's going to be a very difficult decision for the president.&quot;    One White House official said the president's instinct is to veto the measure, but another official added that &quot;most people are trying to convince the president to sign it.&quot;    The six GOP congressional leaders who met with the president yesterday were unanimous in urging him to sign the bill. They reminded the president that they had supported his positions on defense spending and taxes in the past.    &quot;He got it from people who have carried a lot of water for him, like (Colorado Sen.) Bill Armstrong, who has been the guardian of the gate of the defense budget,&quot; Sen. Simpson said.    Some of the congressional leaders also argued the president to sign the measure &quot;so we can get through the political year without the anguish of another debt limit extension,&quot; Sen. Simpson said. The bill's increase in the debt limit would last until May 1989, and thus avoid the need for any more wrenching debt-limit debates until after next year's elections.    Within the administration, Treasury Secretary Baker has argued forcefully that a veto of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-cutting bill would send a terrible signal to the average voter, who believes the law is helping to stop government spending. Mr. Baker also believes a veto could cause interest rates to rise.    The bill would require $23 billion in across-the-board cuts for defense and nondefense spending in the year that starts Oct. 1 unless action is taken to reduce the deficit by Nov. 20.    Congressional Democrats believe that the threat of across-the-board defense cuts will force the president to accept a $10 billion to $12 billion tax increase. But some White House officials believe the president might allow the defense cuts to take place rather than support any type of tax increase.    Asked by a reporter yesterday if he had decided whether to sign or veto the bill, President Reagan responded: &quot;Can't you see the wheels turning? I'm still working on that.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
