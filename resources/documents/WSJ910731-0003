MTV, a unit of Viacom Inc., said it will exploit advancessuch as cable compression and fiber optics that are expectedto sharply increase the number of channels on local cablesystems, from an average of 35 now to more than 200 by theend of the decade.</LP><TEXT>   Cable services are looking to expand their space on thecable dial rather than let new services take up the vacantslots. Later this week, pay channels HBO and Cinemax, unitsof Time Warner Inc., are to begin test-marketing so-calledmultiplex delivery, offering different movies at the sametime on three separate HBO channels and two Cinemax channels.   If MTV proceeds with the split, it could begin to look alot like radio. Just as radio stations fragment theirprogramming to target specific musical audiences, thedare-to-be-hip, all-music-video cable channel hopes tofeature a different musical genre on each outlet. One will bethe current MTV mix of rock, heavy metal, rap and pop; theother two will feature more specialized formats. MTVexecutives said they haven't picked the new formats yet, butone likely possibility is a channel carrying rap and urban&quot;street music.&quot;   The three-way MTV would give parent Viacom an even largershare of the cable dial. Viacom, through its MTV Networkssubsidiary, already owns VH-1, a music-video channel for the25-and-older crowd; Nickelodeon, aimed at children by day andat rerun fiends late at night; and a 50% stake in ComedyCentral.   The cost of expanding MTV would be &quot;low and incremental,&quot;said Tom Freston, chairman and chief executive officer of MTVNetworks. Satellite compression technology, lettingprogrammers squeeze more material over the same hardware,will make it possible for MTV to deliver simultaneous feedson the same satellite transponder with no additional costs.   It is a bold move for MTV, which had been criticized forairing a narrow range of rock and shutting out black musicgroups when it premiered a decade ago. More recently, MTV hasexpanded far beyond rock 'n' roll, moving heavily into rapand other forms.   &quot;The audience for music is being fragmented, and ourresearch tells us our audience will be better served by morechannels,&quot; said Mr. Freston.   All three channels will include the MTV name in theirtitles. By the third quarter of 1992, MTV will conductlimited testing on cable systems, including Media GeneralInc.'s 187,000-subscriber system in Fairfax, Va., andCablevision Systems Corp.'s service in Boston and Brookline,Mass., with 110,000 subscribers.   &quot;MTV is just looking for shelf space in the supermarket ofcable video,&quot; said Don Mathison, Media General's senior vicepresident of marketing and programming.   Each MTV channel will target the same 12-to-34 age group.Tom Freston of MTV Networks insisted in an interview that thestrategy won't siphon away the original MTV audience. &quot;Ourresearch shows the audience will grow with more musicchoices,&quot; he said. MTV currently has 55.1 millionsubscribers.   Advertisers' commercials will run on all three MTVchannels -- sponsors won't be allowed to pick among theservices -- for a single price, Mr. Freston said. Butadvertisers may balk if MTV tries to raise its rates toreflect the broader exposure. &quot;It's a good idea as long as itdoesn't cost us more,&quot; said Joel M. Segal, executive vicepresident of the advertising agency McCann-Erickson USA Inc.,which handles Coca-Cola Co., a heavy advertiser on MTV. &quot;Thiscan only add viewers.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
