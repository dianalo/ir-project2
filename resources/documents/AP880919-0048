GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gen. Saw Maung, leader of a militarycoup that has led to renewed bloodshed in Burma, is a hardliner whohas loyally taken orders from strongman Ne Win throughout most ofhis 39-year military career.   Citing mounting chaos, Saw Maung on Sunday ousted civilianPresident Maung Maung, set up a ``Peace Restoration Committee''with himself as chairman, abolished most organs of state andimposed a curfew on Rangoon, the capital.   Saw Maung promised multiparty general elections when order wasrestored, but people took to the streets of Rangoon today toprotest his seizure of power, and troops fired on them, reportedlykilling dozens.   Most protesters were unarmed.   Analysts had never ruled out the possibility of a coup by the186,000-strong armed forces, the only well organized group left inBurma. But events had appeared to be moving toward a compromisebetween opposition leaders and the entrenched old guard.   Though little is known about Saw Maung, he is widely consideredclose to both Ne Win and the ruthless former President Sein Lwin.Many Western diplomats in Rangoon believe both men remain the keypower brokers in Burma, despite their official resignations.   Saw Maung, 59, was named defense minister July 27 in Sein Lwin'sgovernment, which subsequently ordered troops to gun down unarmedprotesters. Faced by huge, national demonstrations, Sein Lwinresigned Aug. 12 after 17 days in power, but Saw Maung maintainedboth his defense portfolio and post as head of the armed forces.   His close association with Sein Lwin, described by opponents as``the most hated man in Burma,'' may have helped provoke today'sdisplays of outrage on Rangoon's streets.   Saw Maung was also criticized earlier by key opposition figureAung Gyi for bypassing the prescribed chain-of-command when heordered the 44th Light Infantry Division into Rangoon in March toput down student-led demonstrations with brutal force.   ``He lacks the intellectual gifts of his predecessors at thatpost and, therefore, is seen as easily manipulated by the two topleaders,'' wrote Burma expert Bertil Lintner in a recent issue ofthe Hong Kong-based news magazine Far Eastern Economic Review.   Orders from the top men _ Ne Win and Sein Lwin _ are normallyexecuted by Saw Maung's deputy, Maj. Gen. Than Shwe, who Lintnerdescribed as ``a ruthless field commander who is more feared thanrespected by his subordinates.''   Than Shwe was listed in the No. 2 position on the 19-memberPeace Restoration Commitee.   According to official records, Saw Maung was born in Mandalayand studied at a high school in that former royal capital.   He joined the army in 1949, one year after Burma gainedindependence from Britain. Although he was not of Ne Win'sgeneration, which fought first against the British and then theJapanese in World War II, Saw Maung appeared to have gained thegeneral's favor.   By 1967, five years after Ne Win's military coup against ademocratically elected government, Saw Maung became a battalioncommander and major. From 1975 to 1976 he headed the 99th LightInfantry Division, which fought communist insurgents and ethnicminority Kachin rebels in remote frontier areas.   An alleged coup attempt by some military officers against Ne Winin 1976 saw a major purge of army ranks. ``Those who stayed on anddid well had to prove their loyalty,'' notes Josef Silverstein, aBurma scholar at New Jersey's Rutgers University.   Saw Maung was rewarded in 1976 with the Southwest Command, oneof nine regional military commands in Burma. He held the positionuntil 1981 when he became the adjutant general.   Two years later he was named army commander, or the vice chiefof staff for the army in Burma, and deputy defense minister. He waspromoted to chief of staff, or armed forces commander, in 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
