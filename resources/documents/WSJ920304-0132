Apple said it is negotiating with Adobe Systems Inc., PaloAlto, Calif., about incorporating Adobe's forthcomingCarousel technology into the company's Macintosh systemsoftware. &quot;Look for us to support Carousel, although wehaven't decided whether to incorporate it into the system,&quot;said Roger Heinen, Apple's general manager for MacintoshSoftware Architecture. Apple is Adobe's largest customer.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Heinen's comments are a boost for Adobe's plans tocreate a standard way of transferring documents from one typeof computer or application to another. Currently, suchtransfers are bedeviled by a &quot;tower of Babel&quot; approach tocomputer design that makes it virtually impossible tomaintain the same look and design of a document as it movesfrom one incompatible computer to another.   Separately, Apple disclosed that in 1990 it licensedcryptographic and security software from RSA Data SecurityInc., a closely held concern in Redwood City, Calif. Thesoftware both encrypts data transmitted over networks andenables a sender to authenticate a document with a distinct&quot;digital signature.&quot;   Apple said it is building RSA Data's code into its OpenCollaboration Environment, a forthcoming extension of itsMacintosh system software. The first part of the extensionwill be released late this year, Apple said.   In connection with its support for data encryption, Applesaid it had applied to the U.S. Commerce Department for theright to export software containing the technology, which isgenerally restricted as a sensitive technology. Apple said itexpects to receive export approval because the NationalSecurity Agency, a leading agency on cryptographic policy,has reviewed the design and raised no objections to it.   Apple's announcements came at a conference on its plansfor its basic Macintosh software, where executives of theCupertino, Calif., company tried to dispel doubts that itspartnership with International Business Machines Co. meansits commitment to its Macintosh computer family is weakening.&quot;The Macintosh architecture is expandable way into the year2000,&quot; said Michael Spindler, Apple's chief operatingofficer. &quot;For us, the Mac is the core of our structure.&quot;   The Apple-IBM partnership last month launched Taligent,whose goal is to create a new basic operating system forpersonal computers, codenamed Pink. Taligent is producingsoftware for an IBM microprocessor called Power PC.   Macintosh software currently only runs on chips fromMotorola Inc. Apple executives said that software written forthe Macintosh will work on future systems using the IBM chip.   Apple also stressed that the Macintosh software would notcompete against Taligent software for customer loyalties.Taligent &quot;is not a replacement strategy for the Mac,&quot; saidMr. Heinen. &quot;This isn't like two spouses. It's like twochildren. You can love them both.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
