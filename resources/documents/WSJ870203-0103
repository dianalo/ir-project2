The bank holding company, which is the parent of the Bank of Miami, said it filed a motion with the Dade County Circuit Court here for reconsideration of the judgment, which was entered in a dispute over payments on an account. The company said the judgment led it to create a $1.7 million contingency reserve for the fourth quarter of 1986. It said it will appeal the judgment if the bid for reconsideration is denied.    Popular Bancshares said that neither the court judgment nor the establishment of the fund is expected to affect the company's previously reported proposed acquisition by Southeast Banking Corp. A Southeast spokesman concurred in that assessment. Popular said it will hold a special meeting for its shareholders to vote on the transaction March 27.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Popular Bancshares closed at $5.75 a share, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
