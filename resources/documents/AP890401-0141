Corporate takeovers, restructurings and other such risks areprompting big life insurance companies to dump corporate bonds fromtheir portfolios.   The trend could spell trouble for the corporate bond market,since life insurance companies own about half the industrial bondsoutstanding, according to the American Council of Life Insurance.   A recent survey by the trade group found that 66 of its membercompanies had curtailed their purchase of certain high-gradecorporate bonds. The reason is the fear of takeovers andrestructurings of bond issuers that may damage the value of the thebonds.   Such corporate makeovers typically result in a company taking onmore debt. The increased debt load often prompts the bond-ratingcompanies, such as Moody's Investors Service and Standard andamp; Poor'sCorp., to lower the ratings for the bonds because the increaseddebt raises questions about the companies' ability to make good onthe bonds.   And when a bond's rating is lowered, its price usually falls.   When asked whether they experienced any investment losses due tocorporate restructurings since January 1986, 81 of the 108 lifeinsurance companies that responded to the February survey said yes.   During the three-year period covered by the survey, theinsurance companies said the value of their corporate bonds dropped12.6 percent because of corporate restructurings.   ``Life insurers have a need for a good market and a good supplyof investment-grade corporate bonds,'' said Paul Reardon, directorof investment research for the council. He said the companies needto ensure a steady stream of income from long-term investments suchas bonds in order to pay off their policy claims.   ``But for a number of years, life insurance companies havequietly been avoiding industrial bonds because of the problem ofevent risk, which is something that is difficult to assess inadvance,'' he said in an interview last week.   Reardon said life insurers had believed they could avoidexposing their investments to these risks by buying only theinvestment-grade bonds of the largest industrial companies, ``withthe hope that they would be too big to be the target of a takeoverattack.''   But the leveraged buyout of tobacco and food giant RJR NabiscoInc. earlier this year blew that belief out of the water.   ``The RJR buyout was the event which brought it to a headbecause it was so huge and it did result in large losses orreduction in market value (of bonds) to some insurance companies,''he said.   Some life insurers did more than just fume about their losses.They sued.   The Hartford Insurance Group, the insurance unit of ITT Corp.,filed suit in November against RJR Nabisco over its buyout plans.The suit, which is pending, alleges the insurer lost about $2.25million in the value of its $25 million worth of RJR Nabisco bondsafter the buyout was announced.   ``We bought investment-grade securities in the spring, and bythe fall they were trading as junk bonds,'' said Edward N. Bennett,the Hartford's chief investment officer.   For some time before the RJR Nabisco buyout the Hartford hadbeen shifting out of corporate bonds, Bennett said. But that dealaccelerated the trend, he said.   In place of corporate bonds, life insurers are turning to otherlong-term investments, Bennett and Reardon said. These include themortgage-backed securities issued by several government agencies,bonds issued by foreign governments and utility company bonds _none of which is at risk for takeover.   Reardon said the corporate bond market may not yet be feelingthe pinch from the changed investment stragegy of insurancecompanies because few long-term industrial bonds have been issuedin recent months.   But, he said, ``industrial companies will have to improve theterms (of their bonds) when they come to the market in the futurewhen they market significantly larger quantities of debt.''   One way companies can improve their bonds is to includeguarantees that they will not take on additional debt withoutbondholder approval. Such guarantees, called covenants, arebecoming more common in corporate debt instruments as investorsgrow more wary of takeover aftershock.   But Bennett said he believed companies could find a way aroundthese covenants, and so they may not be worth all that much. Thelasting effect of the takeover craze, he said, may be the virtualdemise of long-term corporate debt financing.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Monday, April 3</NOTE></DOC>
