The company's refusal to provide information about the policy'senforcement at the union's request also constituted an unfair laborpractice, the judge, Wallace Nations, said in his ruling last weekin Washington.   Such testing meets legal definitions of issues that must benegotiated between employers and unions, the judge said.   Nations recommended the newspaper offer a job to any applicantrejected under the policy since it was imposed in January 1987 andto pay the applicant for related losses. He also recommended thatthe company rescind any punishment that might have been imposed onemployees under the policy and compensate them for their losses.   Diane Williams, assistant director of the National LaborRelations Board's information division, said the ruling may set anational precedent because the board has not ruled on appeals ofsuch matters.   The Star Tribune's policy requires a medical exam, including drugand alcohol screening, for applicants to whom the company offers ajob. If applicants test positive for drug use, the company willwithdraw the job offer.   Under the policy, current employees also may be asked to undergoscreening when management believes job performance or conduct isimpaired by alcohol or drug abuse.   John Dennison, vice president of labor relations for thenewspaper, said Monday that no employee has been tested under thepolicy since it took effect Jan. 1, 1987, and that he knew of onejob applicant who had withdrawn after learning about the policy.   The newspaper also was urged by the judge to revoke its drug andalcohol testing policies covering applicants and employees in guildjobs and to negotiate future policies with The Newspaper Guild ofthe Twin Cities. The guild's Local 2 represents about 350 newsroomand circulation employees of the Star Tribune.   Dennison said the company was disappointed by the ruling but hadnot decided whether to appeal to the full NLRB.   Joe Moore, the board's deputy executive secretary, said that ifthe company does not appeal Nations' ruling by Dec. 1, the boardwill adopt it, probably in early December, and the recommendationswill take effect. If the company does appeal, a panel or the fullboard will consider it.</TEXT></DOC>
