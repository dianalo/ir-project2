ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chunks of shrapnel from unexplained explosionsare hurtling through space at 22,000 mph and forcing designers toadd tons of shielding to protect the proposed U.S. space stationand its crew.   Nearly 7,100 pieces of orbiting debris are being tracked by theU.S. Space Command and more than half came from satellites or spentrockets that ``have blown up or broken up for unknown reasons,'' aNASA expert says.   More than 90 satellites to date have shattered unaccountably,but Don Kessler, project scientist for debris studies at theJohnson Space Center in Houston, said he doubts the cause iscollisions with meteoroids or tests of secret anti-satelliteweapons.   ``They are like a time bomb waiting to explode,'' Kessler saidin a telephone interview. ``These explosions have occurredeverywhere, from one day (after launch) to three years.''   Space station planners, ``faced with a considerable designproblem,'' are adding 2,000 pounds to the shielding of each of thesix modules occupied by astronauts.   ``The debris gets most severe at 500-600 miles,'' Kessler said,``but usually unmanned spacecraft are at that altitude and don'trequire the same level of safety as a crew.'' The space shuttlegenerally operates at altitudes of 150 to 300 miles and so will thespace station.   ``When I first started working in this area, very few peopleknew how their spacecraft were breaking up, including thedesigners,'' Kessler said. ``The Space Command knew they werebreaking up, but never took the time to identify why.''   He said officials have long believed that French-made Arianerockets explode in space but their orbits are difficult to trackwith ground radar. Two years ago, however, an Ariane was launchedinto an easy-to-track orbit and, Kessler said, ``it blew up afternine months.'' The fragments of that explosion _ probably caused byover pressurization of gases _ number 450.   Americans and Soviets contribute to the space junk, too. SixU.S. Delta rocket second stages exploded, the last in 1981 _ threeyears after it was launched. The cause was leakage of fuels thatburn when they combine and the problem was fixed in later models.   Such explosions cause an expanding cloud of debris _ ``a problemanalogous to cars driving around a parking lot in random directions_ you can get hit from any direction and the most likely directionwill be head-on,'' Kessler said.   The $1 billion space telescope scheduled to be put into orbitnext year will operate 300 miles high. A study by the SpaceTelescope Institute concluded the instrument should be designeddifferently because of the debris, he said.   Maj. Alex Mondragon of the U.S. Space Command in ColoradoSprings, Colo., said 5,331 pieces of debris and 1,759 ``workingpayloads'' were being tracked as of April 19. The objects ranged insize from the Soviet Mir space station to a screwdriver dropped bya spacewalking astronaut.   Space shuttle Challenger returned from a mission in June 1983with a chip in a cockpit window and chemical analysis showed theculprit was a flake of the paint used on rockets and payloads.   The few objects returned from space all have shown debrisdamage. The Palapa and Westar satellites that were retrieved by aspace shuttle crew were pitted, but not damaged enough to keep themfrom functioning. The Solar Max satellite, repaired in orbit,showed many hits _ some penetrating an insulation blanket anddamaging the surface beneath.   ``A 3 millimeter particle has as much kinetic energy as abowling ball going 60 miles an hour and if it hit an electricalcomponent, it would probably cause that system to ceasefunctioning,'' Kessler said. The average collision velocity wouldbe 22,000 mph, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
