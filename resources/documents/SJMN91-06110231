One ofonly five similar facilities in the state, it is supposed to provide SantaCruz County's 250,000 residents with a permanent drop-off center for householdsolvents, flammable liquids and paints, thus drastically reducing waterpollution and soil contamination.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SANTA CRUZ SITTING OUT TOXIC DISPOSAL PROJECT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Shorter version ran on page 4B of the Morning Final.  </MEMO><TEXT>     But instead of an environmental showpiece, the facility at Buena VistaDrive and Harkins Slough Road has become the flashpoint of a long disagreementbetween county officials and city department heads who can't agree on who willpick up the tab.;    Through 14 months of advance preparation, site plannershad counted on the county's four cities -- Santa Cruz, Capitola, Scotts Valleyand Watsonville -- to share operating costs with the county. The trouble is,it is two weeks until opening day and everyone has paid up but Santa Cruz.;   The result: employees ready to open the gates May 1 are busy takingappointments from people who live in Watsonville, Capitola and Scotts Valley.Santa Cruz city residents with basements full of volatile toxics are beingtold to stay home until their city officials come up with the money.;    &quot;Ithink it's a damn shame,&quot; said Patrick Mathews, the county public worksofficial in charge of the project. &quot;I'm a city resident and my employees won'ttake the stuff from my house.&quot;;    Mathews and other frustrated countyenvironmental officials want Santa Cruz to pay roughly $1 a citizen -- or$50,000 -- to fund the project.;    Setting up the project has cost about$150,000 so far. Mathews has drawn up a $253,000 operating budget for nextyear. Other cities have raised their contributions through various sources:Capitola, for example, levies an additional charge on home garbage pickup andScotts Valley adds the cost to residents' property taxes.;    County employeescomplain they have never really known who the city's contact person is on theissue because so few of their calls and letters have been returned.;    IlseKolbus, county environmental health program manager, said city officialsindicated as early as last February that they wanted to participate in theBuena Vista program but have never discussed the funding seriously.;    &quot;Nowit feels like we are trying to drag them into something they didn't want todo,&quot; Kolbus said.;    Santa Cruz officials deny that they have beenstonewalling at the expense of the environment.;    &quot;That's the county's storybecause they want us to pay for their facility,&quot; said Larry Erwin, director ofcity public works.;    Erwin said he considers household toxic waste disposala priority. But the city will not come up with $50,000 because Santa Cruzleaders want to build their own facility at the municipal dump on Dimeo Lane,he said. To date, however, no applications have been filed with the state forsuch a facility.;    Erwin said he has begun the first step of that process,looking to hire a hazardous waste director for the city landfill. The citywill apply for permits in the next several months, he added, and expects toopen its own facility by the end of the year.;    Until then, he said, cityresidents will have to be patient.;    &quot;It really doesn't make a lot of senseto tell the citizens to drive to Buena Vista and then retrain them to drive toDimeo Lane six months later,&quot; Erwin said.;    Santa Cruz City fire chief EdEkers said the city is still negotiating with the county and may reach anagreement &quot;in the near future&quot; that would allow the city to pay a fee based onthe number of residents who use the facility. Ekers said the proposal &quot;gotstacked up&quot; in wider city efforts to revamp hazardous material regulations atall levels.;    Local environmental leaders have been operating under theassumption that the city would pay. Ecology Action of Santa Cruz recentlytouted the center in its local newspaper.;    &quot;I don't understand why there'sa glitch,&quot; said the group's executive director, Bonnie Wilson. &quot;I hope itchanges.&quot;;    Wilson worried that city residents who have patiently held on totoxics for years might give up and dump them down drains if they are turnedaway from the county's only local disposal site.;    &quot;People are generallyquite patient, but they do have their limits,&quot; she said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PAUL ROGERS, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Santa Cruz/Monterey  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910419  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  763  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday April 19, 199100110231,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
