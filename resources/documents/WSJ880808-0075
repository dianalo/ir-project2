The report, which is slated for release Thursday, is expected to be the most reliable survey of drought damage so far. It should show declines in most major spring-planted crops, such as corn and soybeans, since the government's first drought analysis was released July 12, according to private economists and crop forecasters.    Few experts are willing to predict exactly what the department will report. However the consensus is that this year's harvest of corn, the nation's most valuable cash crop, will shrink to between 4.0 billion bushels and 4.5 billion bushels from last year's production of 7.1 billion bushels.    The production of soybeans, the second-most valuable U.S. crop, is widely-expected to decline 21%, to 1.5 billion bushels, from the 1.9 billion bushels harvested last fall.    Some companies that make meal and vegetable oil from soybeans said they may have to take the unprecedented step of importing soybeans if this year's crop continues to shrink.    &quot;Anything below 1.5 billion bushels is serious,&quot; said David Swanson, president and chief executive officer of Central Soya, which buys about 100 million bushels of soybeans annually. &quot;As it approaches 1.3 billion, we would have to clearly do something to meet our needs.&quot;    Such a small harvest would mean that many farmers wouldn't be able to fulfill contracts to deliver soybeans to local grain elevators, which in turn have obligations with soybean processors. Indeed, many rural elevator operators are growing concerned about a financial shakeout of their industry.    Even if the soybean harvest doesn't fall below 1.5 billion bushels, the rise in prices that could follow the expected decline would threaten the U.S's position as a major soybean exporter, some soybean analysts said. Many importers of U.S. soybeans would probably cut their consumption by feeding domestically-grown crops to their livestock. The Soviet Union might be an exception, because it doesn't have big grain surpluses.    A soybean shortage would also pinch U.S. companies that use soybean by-products to make everything from margarine to newspaper ink. Already, the cost of buying soybean oil has risen by half from last summer, according to a buyer for a major salad dressing maker. &quot;If the {government} report estimates a 1.55 billion bushel crop, prices would go up more,&quot; the buyer said.    The department's Thursday report will update the July 12 armchair estimate that U.S. corn and soybean harvests will decrease by 26% and 13%, respectively, from the 1987 crops. Unlike the July report, which was widely-thought to have understated drought damage, this report is based on a comprehensive monthly survey that began on Aug. 1 and has a reputation for accuracy.    Government workers sample nearly 1,800 soybean fields in 15 states. But the estimates aren't infallible. The August 1983 survey missed a drought. And government officials warn that the spotty conditions of many fields, as well as the decision of some farmers to abandon their crops, could skew results.    The government's estimate of the corn harvest might signal shifts in farm policy. According to economists, a harvest of 4.5 billion bushels would likely leave a U.S. corn stockpile of two billion bushels by the fall of 1989. At that level the department could permit farmers in the government program to plant on more land.    Corn farmers were required to idle 20% of their land this year to qualify for price support payments. The set-aside requirement would fall to 12.5%, or less, if the stockpile trigger is hit, economists said. </TEXT></DOC>
