According to the applicant, the new cogeneration facilityis expected to be completed and in commercial operation by November 1,1990. Megan-Racine states that the gas will be used to fuel a new combined-cycleunit certified by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as a ``qualifyingcogeneration facility'' under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Actof 1978. The steam produced will be sold to the Kraft, Inc., plant andthe electricity generated will be sold to Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation(Niagara Mohawk) under a 15-year power sales agreement dated November 1,1987. Megan-Racine would purchase the gas from Western Gas Marketing Limited(Western Gas) pursuant to a precedent agreement enclosed as part of theapplication. The precedent agreement was executed on April 12, 1989, lateramended in minor respects, and included a proposed gas purchase contract.The proposed contract would require Megan-Racine to pay Western Gas, forgas delivered, a price that is the sum of the monthly demand charge andthe monthly commodity charge in effect for each month. The monthly demandcharge is derived by multiplying the daily contract quantity (initiallyset at 11,700 Mcf) by a demand rate that is the sum of the monthly demandcharges paid by Western Gas for transportation of Megan-Racine's dailycontract quantity on the pipeline systems of NOVA Corporation of Alberta(NOVA), TransCanada PipeLines, Ltd. (TransCanada), and Niagara Gas Transmission,Ltd. (Niagara Gas), plus a supply reservation fee of $4.563 per Mcf permonth. The commodity charge is initially set at $1.45 per MMBtu deliveredto the United States border and is to be adjusted quarterly pursuant toa formula that is based equally on the percentage change in Niagara Mohawk'saverage annual marginal avoided energy cost above or below a base costof $.253 per kilowatt-hour and the percentage change in CNG TransmissionCorporation's (CNG) gas commodity component in its RQ Rate Schedule aboveor below a base cost of $2.4146 per MMBtu. The agreement also providesfor a reopening of the pricing provisions prior to the start of the contractyears commencing November 1, 1995, and November 1, 2000. If the partiesare unable to reach agreement on a revised price formulation, the agreementprovides for arbitration. The proposed contract obligates Megan-Racine to take delivery of at least60 percent of the annual contract quantity (defined as the daily contractquantity multiplied by the number of days in the year) but provides thatundeliveries below the 60 percent minimum level may be purchased by theapplicant during the succeeding 12 month period. Megan-Racine must paya deficiency charge levied on the volumes not taken below the minimum quantityequal to the average commodity charge in effect during the year. In addition,the amount that Western Gas is obligated to supply is subject to reductionif Megan-Racine takes less than minimum contract volumes. Megan-Racine indicates that Western Gas would transport the natural gasthrough the pipeline facilities of NOVA and TransCanada in Canada to anexisting interconnection with the pipeline facilities of Niagara Gas. Thegas would then be transported on the Niagara system to an existing interconnectionwith the distribution system of St. Lawrence Gas Company, Inc. (St. Lawrence),at the international border of the United States and Canada near Massena,New York, where delivery to the applicant would take place. Megan-Racinestates that such routing would necessitate the construction of eight milesof 12 inch diameter distribution line connecting the cogeneration facilityto St. Lawrence's existing distribution system.In support of its application, Megan-Racine states that all of the naturalgas imported under its requested authorization would be used to fuel thenew cogeneration facility. The applicant asserts that its arrangement withWestern Gas is and would remain competitive over the proposed term. Megan-Racinemaintains that the arrangement would provide it with a wide degree of flexibilityto vary its daily, monthly, and annual takes to conform to the operationalcharacteristics of the cogeneration facility. Megan-Racine further assertsthat additional flexibility for both parties is enhanced by their opportunityto renegotiate pricing provisions in 1995 and 2000. With respect to theapplicant's decision to select a Canadian supplier, Megan-Racine statesthat it contracted domestic gas suppliers, but was not able to find termsthat were as competitive as those negotiated with Western Gas. Megan-Racinemaintains that the proposed arrangement would provide reasonable assurancesthat a secure supply of natural gas will be available for purchase fromWestern Gas. The applicant also states that it has either received or isplanning to receive various state and local environmental approvals forthe proposed project. For these reasons, Megan-Racine maintains that theproposed import is consistent with the public interest.Megan-Racine filed a certification of compliance with the coal capabilityrequirement for proposed new electric powerplants on October 11, 1989,pursuant to the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 (FUA) (10U.S.C. 3801 <T3>et seq.</T3>, as amended; 53 FR 35544, September 14, 1988).The decision on Megan-Racine's application for import authority will bemade consistent with the DOE's gas import policy guidelines, under whichthe competitiveness of an import arrangement in the markets served is theprimary consideration in determining whether it is in the public interest(49 FR 6684, February 22, 1984). Other matters that may be considered inmaking a public interest determination include need for gas, security ofthe long-term supply, and any relevant issues that may be unique to cogenerationfacilities. Parties that may oppose this application should comment intheir responses on the issues of competitiveness, need for the gas, andsecurity of supply as set forth in the policy guidelines. Megan-Racineasserts that this import arrangement is in the public interest becauseit is competitive and its gas source will be secure. Parties opposing theimport arrangement bear the burden of overcoming these assertions.All parties should be aware that if the requested import is approved, theauthorization would be conditioned on the filing of quarterly reports indicatingvolumes imported and the purchase price.<ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Compliance</ITAG>Under section D of the DOE guidelines for compliance with the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>, actions that grant or deny import authorizations whereno new gas transmission facilities are needed but where new ancillary facilitiesare to be constructed, such as a cogeneration facility, would normallyrequire the preparation of an environmental assessment (EA), because theyinvolve ``minor new construction'' (54 FR 12474, March 27, 1989). However,we believe that preparation of an EA to approve or disapprove this applicationis unnecessary, and compliance with NEPA for the proposed action can beachieved by invoking two categorical exclusions in the DOE NEPA guidelines(52 FR 47622, December 15, 1987).The environmental impacts of constructing and operating new cogenerationfacilities have been addressed on numerous occasions by the Economic RegulatoryAdministration (ERA) in conjunction with processing exemption petitionsunder the FUA, and as a result, such actions have been granted a categoricalexclusion from further NEPA review (52 FR 47670, December 15, 1987). Thecogeneration facilities to be constructed in connection with these importapplications are identical to those facilities covered by the categoricalexclusion for FUA actions. Therefore, it is an appropriate applicationof another categorical exclusion contained in the DOE guidelines for ``actionsthat are substantially the same as other actions for which the environmentaleffects have already been assessed in a NEPA document and determined byDOE to be clearly insignificant and where such assessment is currentlyvalid'' (52 FR 47668, December 15, 1987) to extend the FUA categoricalexclusion for cogeneration facilities to the grant of an authorizationto import natural gas under the NGA which results in the construction andoperation of a cogeneration facility.A categorical exclusion raises a rebuttal presumption that the Federalaction will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment.Unless it appears during the proceedings on this import application thatthe grant or denial of authorization will significantly affect the qualityof the human environment, the Office of Fuels Programs expects that noadditional environmental review will be required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Procedures</ITAG>In response to this notice, any person may file a protest, motion to interveneor notice of intervention, as applicable and written comments. Any personwishing to become a party to the proceeding and to have the written commentsconsidered as the basis for any decision on the application must, however,file a motion to intervene or notice of intervention, as applicable. Thefiling of a protest with respect to this application will not serve tomake the protestant a party to the proceeding, although protests and commentsreceived from persons who are not parties will be considered in determiningthe appropriate action to be taken on the application.
