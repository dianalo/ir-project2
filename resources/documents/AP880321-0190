Maj. Gary Hovatter, spokesman for the American forces inHonduras, made the announcement Monday but refused to disclosedetails.   The announcement came as Nicaragua's Sandinista government andContra rebels agreed to halt all offensive military operationsduring three days of talks that began Monday. The negotiations areto achieve a permanent cease-fire.   U.S. troops arrived in Honduras last week at the request ofPresident Jose Azcona Hoyo and are stationed at five basesthroughout Honduras. The soldiers are from the 82nd AirborneDivision based in Fort Bragg, N.C. and the 7th Light InfantryDivision from Fort Ord, Calif.   In an exercise Monday, a U.S. helicopter crashed near a base inthe southern town of Juticalpa with 10 people aboard. Hovatter saidthere were injuries but would not give further information untilrelatives are notified. Pentagon spokesmen in Washington said therewere no fatalities and that the injuries did not appear serious.   Some of the U.S. soldiers are based at Jamastran, about 20 milesfrom the Nicaraguan border, but 80 miles from the site of thealleged Nicaraguan incursion at the Bocay region in the Honduranprovince of Olancho. The Bocay area straddles theNicaraguan-Honduran border.   Others are at Tamara and at San Lorenzo in southern Honduras,and a corps of about 200 soldiers remained at American militaryheadquarters at the Honduran air force base of Palmerola, about 45miles northwest of Tegucigalpa.   President Reagan dispatched the troops both as a show of supportfor Honduras and as a warning to Nicaragua against further actionin the area.   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua repeatedly has denied hiscountry's troops were inside Honduras. The Contras maintain supplyand staging camps in Bocay region.   Honduran presidential spokesman Lisandro Quesada said Monday theestimated 2,000 Sandinista troops who entered this country lastweek in pursuit of Contra rebels have dwindled.   Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides, the Honduran armed forces publicrelations director, said it will be ``days only'' before the U.S.troops return home.   Neither Suarez nor Quesada would say the threat from theSandinistas has ended.   ``When the last Sandinista crosses the Segovia River intoNicaragua then this subject will be forgotten,'' Quesada said.</TEXT></DOC>
