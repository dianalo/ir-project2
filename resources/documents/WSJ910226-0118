But you are incorrect in other assertions.   Secretary Baker does not want a European arms pactpostponed indefinitely. He recognizes that the treaty isoverwhelmingly in the West's interest and has indicated thatthe U.S. is actively pursuing resolution of this problem sothat the treaty can be submitted to Congress.</LP><TEXT>   The Soviets have indeed moved -- legally -- thousands ofpieces of equipment behind the Urals. You question their&quot;intentions&quot; -- which were to preserve these forces fromdestruction -- but fail to note that placing these weapons instorage behind the Urals says something important aboutSoviet intentions regarding a surprise attack or general warin Europe.   You also point out that the Soviets undercounted theirmilitary hardware by several thousand in CFE. But you ignorethe fact that U.S. intelligence wildly overestimated the sizeof Soviet forces in the zone, that most of the parties to theCFE treaty had underreported their forces, and that thetreaty foresaw the difficulty of assembling the requiredinformation and specifically provides several months foradjusting data.   You cite &quot;the Backfire bomber, the Krasnoyarsk radar,{and} anti-missile defenses&quot; as evidence of Soviet &quot;deceit orviolation.&quot; The Krasnoyarsk radar was a violation of theanti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty -- and the &quot;high priests&quot;at the Arms Control Association said so at the time. But theBackfire bomber has been limited in both CFE and Startand isnot at issue in either negotiation.   You argue that the 1969 ABM Treaty (actually signed in1972) blocks a defense against future Scuds, which is notquite right. If we wish to defend Cleveland againstshort-range Scuds (launched from a fractious Canada?), wecan. But we cannot legally develop or deploy large-scale orspace-based defenses against long-range strategic ballisticmissiles. However, even if we chose to sacrifice the GoldenCalf of the ABM Treaty for the Golden Turkey of StrategicDefense Initiative, we could not protect Cleveland fromnuclear destruction unless the defenses worked perfectly.   You note that we can't locate Scuds in Iraq and concludethat we can't find mobile missiles in the Soviet Union. True,with two important caveats. First, the point of mobilemissiles is to be survivable, not to be targetable. So muchfor the argument that the B-2 bomber is useful as a mobilemissile killer. Second, the question is whether we canconfidently count -- not locate -- mobile missiles in theSoviet Union, and whether we can count them more confidentlywith Start on-site, on-demand verification provisions orwithout.   You then state that Start limits cruise missiles, which isonly half true. Start loosely limits U.S. and Sovietnucleararmed cruise missiles. It does not in any way limitconventionally armed cruise missiles, which are the ones youclaim can spare civilians through precision targeting.
