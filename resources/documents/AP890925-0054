(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Residents took forecasters at their wordwhen they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number ofdeaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthyrespect, authorities said.   The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 17 lives inSouth Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, whichbore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.   ``We just feel very thankful about that,'' said Mayor Joseph P.Riley Jr. ``Several thousands of people who were in the sheltersand the tens of thousands of people who evacuated inland werepotential victims of injury and death.''   Riley and other officials credited residents with monitoring thehurricane as it spun toward Charleston, and heeding evacuationwarnings.   The last big storm to hit South Carolina was Hurricane David in1979, which hit the coast after pounding southern Florida.   Since then several big storms have threatened but veered away,and officials were worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo'swarnings.   ``We've had so many close calls,'' said Gary Garnet, ameteorologist with the National Weather Service.   ``But this storm was very, very strong,'' he said. ``This timethey realized it.''   Glen Ellis, a Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000residents in Charleston and the three surrounding counties headedfor shelters.   Tens of thousands more got into their cars and headed upInterstate 26 toward Columbia.   Mayor John Bourne of North Charleston, where there apparentlywere no storm-related deaths, credited people for heeding thewarnings.   ``It was bad, but it could have been a lot worse,'' he said.``You've just got to say nice things about the people.''   Meanwhile, Garnet had some good news for storm-wearyCharlestonians: late Saturday the tropics were quiet with no otherstorms brewing.   ``There's nothing to worry about out there,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
