The military said four more soldiers jailed in plots againstPresident Corazon Aquino also were missing.   The government told foreign and Philippine reporters not topublish or broadcast interviews with former Lt. Col. Gregorio``Gringo'' Honasan, who fled a prison ship in Manila Bay beforedawn Saturday with 14 of his navy guards.   Honasan's coup attempt left at least 53 people dead and hundredswounded. He had been confined in the prison ship since his arrestDec. 9.   Chief military spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo said the armedforces had received reports that Honasan, 39, had been seen inManila, rural Luzon and Mindanao island, about 500 miles south ofthe capital.   ``The search for ex-Col. Honasan continues,'' Florendo toldreporters. ``However, right now, we don't have any concrete lead tofollow.''   Florendo denied allegations by opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrilethat troops raided Enrile's vacation house in Batangas provinceSunday during the search.   Honasan was Defense Ministry security chief when Enrile wasminister of national defense. Enrile was fired in November 1986after the government said it prevented a coup attempt by hisfollowers.   Florendo said three officers and an enlisted man jailed forinvolvement in the 1987 coup attempts were missing from thedetention center at Villamor Air Base. But he said the four fledbecause of ``pressing family problems'' and their escape was notrelated to Honasan's breakout.   Armed troops seeking Honasan manned checkpoints around Manilaand searched private vehicles. The Philippine Constabularystrengthened security in southern provinces to prevent Honasan fromslipping out of the country by boat to Malaysia, a traditionalescape route for fugitives and political dissidents.   Share prices on the Manila Stock Exchange closed 2.28 per centlower Monday after trading resumed following the Easter break.Traders blamed the decline on fears of instability in the wake ofHonasan's escape.   Florendo said the military found no evidence that foreignerswere involved in the escape. Leftist Rep. Venancio Garduce had saidAmericans may have helped Honasan escape to pressure the governmentas it begins talks Tuesday with the United States on the status ofits military bases here.   Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez told Philippine radio andtelevision stations they may lose their licenses if they broadcastinterviews with Honasan, who gave many interviews before his arrest.   Ordonez issued the warning after the private radio station DZXLsought permission to air a statement from Honasan hours after heescaped. A DZXL official confirmed it had a taped statement fromHonasan but would not say what it contained.   Ordonez said the rights of free speech and press were thehallmarks of Philippine democracy, restored after Mrs. Aquino wasswept to power in the February 1986 civilian-military uprising thattoppled President Ferdinand Marcos.   ``However, like all other freedoms, these rights cannot bepermitted by the duly constituted government to be employed todestroy the very government which guarantees these protections,''he said.   He said the policy also applied to foreign correspondents andPhilippine print media. But he gave no legal basis for includingnewspapers, which do not need a license to operate.</TEXT></DOC>
