Only 10 states had fully computerized their criminalrecords by 1989, the last year for which statistics areavailable, and 32 states had automated half their files,according to Search Group Inc., a Sacramento, Calif., companythat follows court statistics. As a result, judges andprosecutors say, authorities are often unaware of a suspect'sprevious convictions or outstanding charges.</LP><TEXT>   The Justice Department has begun a three-year, $27 millionprogram to help states automate their records. Without betterrecord-keeping, law enforcement officials say, efforts tofight crime may be stymied by delays in obtaining informationand by gaps in many defendants' criminal records.   &quot;Criminal history is absolutely the linchpin for everymajor criminal-justice improvement that we're talking aboutmaking,&quot; said Benjamin H. Renshaw III, deputy director of theU.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. &quot;It's just a piece ofpaper, but it's a piece of paper that contains informationthat's absolutely critical to every decision that cops,prosecutors, judges and corrections officials will evermake.&quot;   A common problem for many states is that recent arrestsand other information are missing from many defendants' rapsheets. That can lead judges to release someone more readilythan they otherwise might, said Gary D. McAlvey, chief of theIllinois State Police's bureau of identification. &quot;It happensevery day of the week,&quot; he said.   Illinois, for instance, has a backlog of 100,000 criminalcase results waiting to be updated, a chore that Mr. McAlveyestimates will take half a year.   Incomplete records are a problem especially injurisdictions where jail crowding encourages the quickrelease of defendants. The automation of records, includingspeedier access to fingerprint information, will enablejudges to more quickly identify suspects who should be heldlonger. Judge Dalton A. Roberson Sr., chief judge of DetroitRecorder's Court, said he once released a man charged withreceiving stolen property, a relatively minor offense. Twodays later, when the defendant was identified through afingerprint search, the court learned that the man also waswanted on first-degree murder charges.   By including fingerprint information, the improvedrecord-keeping also is expected to make it more difficult forsuspects to get away with providing false names to police. InMassachusetts, for example, Search Group found that it isparticularly easy for suspects to thwart criminal-historysearches because Massachusetts, unlike other states, relieson a suspect's personal information -- such as a SocialSecurity number or mother's maiden name -- instead offingerprints, to find a previous criminal record.   Francis J. Carney, executive director of the MassachusettsCriminal History System Board, said that as a result, one ortwo suspects a month are found to have identified themselvesfalsely as people with no criminal records.   ---   LAWYERS MAY USE newspaper clippings to tout themselves,New York panel says.   An ethics panel of the New York state bar decided thatplaintiff attorneys may mail newspaper articles aboutthemselves and their firms to accident victims, along with aletter soliciting business. The ruling is apparently thefirst of its kind in the nation, several specialists said.   Just as lawyers are allowed to mail letters to potentialclients, they should be allowed to mail copies of articlesabout themselves, the panel said.   But the panel also tacked on a fistful of caveats. Thearticles must not &quot;create an unjustified expectation&quot; orcontain claims that can't be proved, such as a suggestionthat the lawyer is the best in the state. Lawyers mustcorrect any statements in the articles that they know arefalse or misleading. Lawyers cannot have behaved improperlyto get the articles written. And they must file a copy of themailing with court disciplinary committees.   The panel's ruling isn't legally binding on the New Yorkcourt divisions that discipline lawyers. But the courtsalmost always follow bar guidelines, said Steven Finell, vicechairman of the panel.   The New York bar is one of the most liberal in lettinglawyers advertise. In 1990, the ethics panel issued anopinion that attorneys could use client testimonials inadvertising, with certain disclaimers.   &quot;The general rule ought to be that you can advertise allyou want, as long as you don't do anything false ormisleading,&quot; said Monroe H. Freedman, a Hofstra Universitylegal ethics professor.   ---   MYERSON FRAUD TRIAL'S opening arguments are to begintoday.   Harvey D. Myerson, once one of New York's top lawyers, isexpected to do much of the talking in defending againstcharges in federal court that he illegally overbilled hisclients. Mr. Myerson, who was a partner at Finley, Kumble,Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson andamp; Casey before its1988 bankruptcy-court filing and then went on to form Myersonandamp; Kuhn which also ended up in bankruptcy proceedings, wasindicted on charges that he swindled clients and partners outof $3.5 million.   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., theNew York State Urban Development Corp. and the Home InsuranceCorp. are among the clients Mr. Myerson is alleged to havecheated. Among the members of the partnership he is accusedof swindling is Bowie Kuhn, the former commissioner ofmajor-league baseball.   Mr. Myerson -- who is alleged to have charged his clientsand partnership for romantic jaunts to the Kentucky Derby,fur coats and jewels for women friends, and a family trip toMaine -- says he has no more money. He received acourt-appointed lawyer, but in jury selection two weeks agohe did much of the legal work himself.   The criminal case may be the ultimate test for the53-year-old Mr. Myerson, whose legal career was studded withlawsuits filed on behalf of corporate stars. Among them was asuccessful antitrust case against the National FootballLeague. Mr. Myerson's client, the ill-fated U.S. FootballLeague, won, but the jury awarded damages of only threedollars.   Several of Mr. Myerson's former partners are expected totestify against him as the result of plea bargains theyreached with prosecutors on similar charges of defraudingclients. If convicted, Mr. Myerson faces a maximum sentenceof 20 years in prison.</TEXT></DOC>
