Therehave been national press accounts of complaints that theretailer's vaunted service comes on the backs of itssalespeople. There's been a ruling by Washington stateregulators supporting that view. A union lawsuit. Shareholderlitigation. Even union allegations that Nordstrom deceivesshoppers by selling clothes its salespeople have worn -- acharge Nordstrom denies.   It is impossible to predict whether the union spat willturn off Nordstrom customers or detract from the service theyreceive. The company is in the midst of a major nationalexpansion. But whatever the outcome of the fight, theNordstroms are taking the attack on their family-run businesspersonally. They already pay some of the highest wages inretailing.   The company may have underestimated the abilities of amodern union. It is learning firsthand that organized laboris capable of tactics far more sophisticated than thetraditional strike or boycott. The United Food andamp; CommercialWorkers Union, which represents about 2,000 of Nordstrom's30,000 employees, is now attracting national attention toissues that Nordstrom had assumed last year were only oflocal interest.   &quot;The tactics that were traditional in the past didn't workout well in the 1980s,&quot; says Daniel Mitchell, anindustrial-relations professor at the University ofCalifornia at Los Angeles. He says that the Nordstrom case isan example of a broad attempt by unions to try newstrategies.   Nordstrom ignited the dispute last June when it angeredlabor leaders with an unusual contract proposal: Optionalunion membership for employees at its six stores in theSeattle and Tacoma areas. When the Seattle local put theproposal to a vote, only about 250 of its 1,500 membersshowed up. They overwhelmingly rejected the idea.   That's when the union, which has represented Nordstromemployees in hometown Seattle for more than 60 years,threatened to start a public-relations war. Nordstrom stoodits ground.   &quot;The company vastly underestimated our resolve to protectnot only this contract but the other retail contracts&quot; in thearea, contends Joe Peterson, a former Nordstrom shoe salesmanwho heads Local 1001. &quot;Optional union dues systems are meantto do one thing: to eliminate the contract.&quot;   Company officials insist they aren't trying to bust theunion. Management proposed the contract change, Mr. Nordstromsays, because employees had complained over the years aboutmandatory union dues. &quot;It's been a source of irritation forwhat we felt was the majority,&quot; he says.   President Jack McMillan, noting that union members inSeattle get the same wages and benefits as non-unionNordstrom salespeople elsewhere, calls the dues &quot;a bad buy.&quot;   The union considered a strike against popular Nordstrom&quot;suicidal,&quot; Mr. Peterson says. But it seized the opportunityto take on the company over what has come to be known as the&quot;off-the-clock&quot; issue.   Mr. Peterson says Nordstrom salespeople complained to theunion that they were pressured to work without pay to attendstore meetings and to perform other duties such as stockwork, writing thank-you notes to customers and deliveringmerchandise to customers' homes and offices. Initially, Mr.Peterson says even he didn't believe that the practices werewidespread.   Since then, a union inquiry uncovered 825 current andformer salespeople who claim the company owes them more than$5.3 million in back wages. The state's Department of Laborand Industries, backing the union, ordered Nordstrom tochange its practices and pay back wages. And the chain, aftermonths of denying the charges, created a $15 million reservefor settling back-pay claims. It says it has already paidabout $1 million to workers outside Washington state. It alsochanged its record-keeping procedures and vowed to paysalespeople for all time worked.   But Mr. Nordstrom insists &quot;the off-the-clock issue is anothing issue.&quot; He hints that Nordstrom may challenge thestate ruling. &quot;We don't think it will hold up under federalscrutiny,&quot; he says. &quot;We think the law says if the bulk oftheir income is commissions, they're free to go to whateverlengths they want to sell more things. If it means doingthings from home, we feel in most industries it means thetime doesn't have to be accounted for.&quot;   The company also complains that it has been treatedunfairly by the press, including this newspaper, which a rana page one story in February on working conditions at thecompany. Last week, Nordstrom announced a sharp cutback inadvertising in Seattle's two daily newspapers. Companyofficials deny they were retaliating for unfavorablecoverage. Mr. Nordstrom was quoted in the Seattle Times assaying &quot;We think your coverage is horrible, the worst in thenation.&quot;   Nordstrom continues to believe the morale of most of itsemployees is good -- but the union continues to fire afusillade of complaints about the company to regulators, thecourts and the press.   At Nordstrom stores, where Mr. Peterson acknowledges thatunion support &quot;has always been the weakest&quot; among the chainshe has under contract, employees are choosing sides. Somehave quit the union since its contract with Nordstrom expiredAugust 1. The pro-company forces have attended rallies inSeattle and elsewhere along the West Coast.   Roughly half of the employees in Seattle and Tacoma havesigned petitions seeking to decertify the union. &quot;We're veryangry about the way the union has slandered the company andthe integrity of the people who work for the company,&quot; saysJohn Rockwood, a shoe salesman in Seattle leading one of theanti-union drives.   &quot;All the salespeople here operate as entrepreneurs,&quot; hesays. As for the state's finding, he contends: &quot;It's pettylittle time-keeping stuff. We make twice as much money asanybody else in the industry. We just haven't kept meticulousrecords as to the time we have actually spent working for thecompany.&quot;   But the National Labor Relations Board last week dismissedthe Tacoma petition because of unresolved charges of unfairlabor practices. And Mr. Rockwood's decertification drive metthe same fate Monday. NLRB officials say they considerdecertification efforts inappropriate when charges of unfairlabor practices against an employer are pending.   In one charge, which the labor board has consolidated intoits own complaint against the company, the union asserts thatNordstrom enhanced employees' vacation benefits withoutnegotiating with the union. The labor board also is lookinginto a union complaint that Nordstrom sponsored theanti-union rallies.   The union's Mr. Peterson contends that the company isdrumming up anti-union sentiment and aiding the anti-unionforces in other ways. He claims that Mr. Rockwood's schedulewas changed so he could lead the anti-union petition drive.Mr. Rockwood says he was able to take a week off to gathersignatures because &quot;business hasn't been great.&quot;   Still, even Mr. Rockwood can't explain how greenpro-company buttons, proclaiming &quot;No One Asked Us,&quot; suddenlyshowed up in the stores in February. &quot;They just appeared inour department one morning,&quot; says Helen Thompson, who sellsdesigner women's clothes in Tacoma.   Employees who support the union say the pressure frommanagement isn't subtle. &quot;The atmosphere here is, if you'repro-union, you're anti-Nordstrom,&quot; says Sherry Jacobson, whosold women's clothes at the store in Bellevue, Wash., untilquitting this week. &quot;Jim Nordstrom called me and said, `Iwant to know why you have to hurt the company that way.'&quot; Shesays he was referring to interviews she had done with anewspaper and a local TV station.   The company also produced a 22-minute videotape, shownrecently to Nordstrom employees. In the video, BruceNordstrom, a cousin of Jim Nordstrom and one of threethird-generation family members who share the title ofco-chairman, explains the unfavorable press by saying:&quot;Evidently, the union in Seattle feels so vehemently aboutthe issue of union security that they're willing to attackus, even if it means dirty tricks and untruths that are beingpropagated in the press.&quot;   In the video, Bruce Nordstrom admits the company has been&quot;sloppy&quot; in some of its record keeping and is &quot;taking everystep possible to make sure that is cleared up.&quot; But henarrows his eyes for emphasis and says: &quot;I view it as apersonal attack. I would hope that . . . you folks feel it'sa personal attack on you also.&quot;   Mr. Peterson, meanwhile, vows he won't give up the fight.&quot;These issues are not going to go away,&quot; he says. &quot;As far asI'm concerned, we're having a strike without having astrike.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
