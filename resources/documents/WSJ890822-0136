Business certainly hasn't given up the fight for federal limits on plaintiffs' rights in lawsuits over dangerous products. In fact, by scaling back its campaign, business may now have its best chance ever to get Congress to act.    &quot;We've got a new strategy,&quot; says Victor Schwartz, a Washington lawyer who coordinates corporate lobbying on the issue.    Chiefly, that strategy rests on legislation recently introduced by Sen. Bob Kasten (R., Wis.), whose previous bills have been shot down by trial-lawyer groups, consumer advocates and the wily parliamentarian, Sen. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.).    Conspicuously absent from Sen. Kasten's latest offering are two provisions that were prominent in past versions -- and that were particularly dear to business. Missing is a proposed cap on punitive damages (those imposed to punish a company, rather than to compensate a victim). Also omitted is a requirement that plaintiffs prove a specific act of corporate negligence, as opposed to merely a product defect, which is all that is currently necessary in 46 states.    By forgoing those provisions, Mr. Kasten has already achieved a notable victory in securing a handful of Democratic co-sponsors, some of whom have previously opposed such legislation. The Democrats, led by Sen. John Rockefeller (D., W.Va.), could provide key pressure on the Senate leadership to allow a floor vote later this year or in early 1990.    Highly visible support is also coming from the Republican side. In an interview, Vice President Dan Quayle said President Bush is considering lobbying for the Kasten bill, or one like it, because the president &quot;understands the burden our current liability system puts on business.&quot; Meanwhile, behind the scenes, Mr. Schwartz and other lobbyists are subtly recasting the focus of the bill. In private Capitol Hill sessions, the former law professor who calls himself &quot;Schwartz on Torts&quot; is tutoring legislators to link the liability bill to Washington's current buzzword: competitiveness. He argues that lawsuit-induced paralysis will doom U.S. industry as the European Economic Community sprints toward regulatory unification.    The Schwartz lesson is sticking. Sen. Kasten avers that by next year, &quot;product-liability law will be more stable and consistent between Great Britain and Italy than between Wisconsin and Minnesota.&quot; That's an almost verbatim quote from Mr. Schwartz's lobbying materials.    Earlier campaigns for a federal liability law focused on one issue above all others: skyrocketing insurance premiums purportedly caused by the size and unpredictability of damage awards. The &quot;insurance crisis,&quot; according to this argument, had forced family businesses to close their doors and cities to disassemble their playground swing sets.    Proponents of the Kasten bill and its House counterpart still reel off horrifying anecdotal claims. U.S. small airplane manufacturing has almost ceased because of lawsuits, they assert, while U.S. litigation costs have enabled foreign competitors to seize the market for the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine.    And business continues to call attention to the heavy cost of lawsuits over products allegedly posing health risks. &quot;American innovation is being cut off,&quot; seethes Richard Mahoney, chairman of Monsanto Co.    One Monsanto product is a chief exhibit in the corporate lobbying campaign. Recently, the company developed a substitute for asbestos, the insulation material once widely used but now known to be carcinogenic. Mr. Mahoney says he shelved the new phosphate-fiber product, fearing that plaintiffs' lawyers who have brought more than 75,000 suits over asbestos would next attack the substitute, which Monsanto contends is perfectly safe.    Mr. Schwartz, the lobbyist, acknowledges that in the past, business placed too much emphasis on the insurance scare. Indeed, new research is casting doubt on the breadth of the alleged crisis.    Rand Corp., a nonprofit research concern in Santa Monica, Calif., found in a recent study that while the number of lawsuits over allegedly defective products increased sharply between 1973 and 1986, more than half the cases were brought against a relatively small number of defendants. In 1986, Rand estimated, only about 0.9% of the nation's roughly 360,000 manufacturers were defendants in federal lawsuits, up from about 0.5% in 1976.    Mr. Schwartz concedes that &quot;the principal {liability} proposals in this Congress will not lower insurance costs, and they should not be marketed in that fashion.&quot;    That admission ought to cheer opponents of federal liability law. But they still object to provisions designed to shield companies from legal attack. Consumer-advocate Ralph Nader says big manufacturers can't &quot;bribe judges to stop lawsuits, but they can have a lot of influence in Washington&quot; by financially supporting legislators who vote for liability limitations.    Among the Kasten bill's main elements are: a weightier burden of proof on plaintiffs who seek punitive damages; a corporate defense against punitive damage claims for manufacturers whose products have received federal regulatory approval; and a uniform statute of limitations, under which a plaintiff must file suit within two years after discovering his injury and its cause.    These and other federal limits, Mr. Kasten contends, would &quot;replace our current crazy patchwork quilt of 50 different and confusing state product-liability laws with a uniform national system based on common sense and fairness.&quot;    &quot;False,&quot; counters Russ Herman, president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America. &quot;Can industry bear the cost of their mistakes?&quot; he asks. &quot;Of course they can] This is the little guy going up against the big corporation]&quot;    The trial-lawyer group's 70,000 members, of course, take their cut of the little guy's winnings -- typically 30%. Spurred by that self-interest, as well as by professed concern for their clients' rights, the trial lawyers have helped build a sturdy congressional wall blocking federal legislation to limit liability.    The rampart is held together by personal loyalty -- some allies, such as Sen. Hollings, are themselves former plaintiffs' lawyers -- as well as by healthy campaign contributions. The trial-lawyer association's political-action committee is the seventh biggest supporter of federal campaigns, according to the Federal Election Commission, just behind such liability-lid advocates as the American Medical Association, which ranks No. 3. Sen. Hollings's FEC records are thick with maximum $1,000 individual contributions from lawyers; in addition, members of the trial lawyers' association have sponsored major fund-raising events on his behalf.    Mr. Hollings declined to be interviewed for this article, but aides confirmed that he intends to use his considerable power as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee to oppose the Kasten bill. &quot;He believes that the current system, developed at the state level, encourages manufacturer safety,&quot; explains one aide.    The last time a liability bill made it to the Senate floor, in 1987, Sen. Hollings easily prolonged debate until it died. He's again expected to pull out every parliamentary trick, including a filibuster, if the current Kasten bill gets that far. Similar procedural hazards await the recently introduced House version of the bill.    And if the business lobbyists try to add further limits to plaintiffs' rights, they may alienate their already nervous Democratic co-sponsors. At a recent U.S. Chamber of Commerce meeting, Sen. Rockefeller warned that he wouldn't support the Kasten bill if it's amended with more pro-business provisions: &quot;I said, 'Don't look at this as a chance to load up; it's not a Christmas tree.'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
