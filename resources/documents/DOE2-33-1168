The system was designed for the Thomson scattering profilediagnostic to view discrete plasma points along the line defined by avertical ruby laser beam inside the vacuum vessel of the DIII-D tokamak.The system is located just outside a vessel port looking through a multiplelens assembly. Fifty-nine fiber-optic bundle locations spaced withina total height of 26.92 cm allow up to 59 discrete plasma points to beobserved along a vertical height of 127-152 cm within the vacuum vessel.The essential component of the design is the mechanical mount which holdsthe viewing end of the fiber bundles. The mount prevents direct handlingof the bundles, thus eliminating any damage to the fibers, and allowsthe bundles to be precisely positioned in any of the 59 locations withrelative ease. The use of Computer Aided Design (CAD) and the requiredprecision of the design is discussed. 6 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
