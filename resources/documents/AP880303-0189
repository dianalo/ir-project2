Physiologist Judy M. Hopkinson instructed mothers who deliveredbabies 8 to 12 weeks early to empty both breasts at least six timesa day. She said 23 of the non-smoking mothers, or 80 percent,maintained enough milk after the infants went home. But only 3 ofthe 11 mothers who smoked, or 27 percent, continued to produceenough milk.   Hopkinson is located at the department's Children's NutritionResearch Center at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. Herfindings were reported here by the department's AgriculturalResearch Service.   In non-smokers, low milk production is usually due to ``mothersnot pumping their breasts enough,'' she said. ``Generally, it's nota physiological problem.''   But ``smokers have significantly lower milk volume thannon-smokers,'' Hopkinson said. The 11 smokers averaged 11 percentless milk during the first two weeks after giving birth and 40percent less by the fourth week.   The infants have to be tube-fed because they are too immature tosuck and swallow, and ``mothers want to give them their milk,'' shesaid. ``It's one of the few things they can do, and it's a veryemotional issue.''   But many women who deliver prematurely are not getting theappropriate information to produce enough milk, Hopkinson said.Most of the mothers can increase milk production by pumping morefrequently. Five times a day is enough to maintain volume, shesaid, and 8 to 10 times a day will increase milk volume within aweek or two.   Hopkinson said mother's milk is preferred over formula or donormilk beckause it is more suited to the infant and may also enhancethe infant's immunity to infections. Even so, she said, for verylow-birthweight babies, mother's milk must be fortified with extraprotein and minerals, including calcium and phosphorous.</TEXT></DOC>
