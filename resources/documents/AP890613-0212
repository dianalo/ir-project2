(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Preacher Jimmy Swaggart's admission ofsin was a blow not only to his television ministry but to theeconomy of a city that already was hurting from the downturn in theoil industry.   At its peak, Swaggart's ministry was a $150-million-a-yearoperation. It remains one of the biggest industries in the area, butarea business owners and managers know that they aren't as well offas they were before scandal touched the fundamentalist evangelist.   ``When you take a $150 million industry and cripple it, of coursethe entire community's going to feel it,'' said Butch Spyridon,executive director of the Baton Rouge Area Convention and VisitorsBureau.   It was in February 1988 when Swaggart confessed to moral failurefrom the stage of his Family Worship Center church at the heart ofhis 270-acre compound. Although Swaggart didn't admit specifics, arival minister revealed that the transgression involved liaisonswith a New Orleans prostitute.   Baton Rouge's economy has paid along with Swaggart for his sins.   ``Where I used to get 150 rooms a night, now I may get 75,'' saidCraig Michelet, manager of a Holiday Inn near Swaggart's compound.``And I'm probably the only hotel in Baton Rouge still getting anyof that business.''   Michelet remembers the old days fondly _ Swaggart's followersnever got rowdy and didn't frequent the motel bar.   ``They were the easiest guests you could have,'' Michelet said.``It was great business.''   The huge ministry had scheduled nine conventions in 1988 expectedto pull 45,000 delegates and $14 million into the Baton Rougeeconomy.   Most would have come for the family-oriented, four-day ``campmeetings'' Swaggart usually scheduled over holiday periods thattraditionally generated little tourist-oriented revenue.   ``We lost millions last year, although (some) of that was onpaper because he had more meetings scheduled for 1988 than everbefore,'' Spyridon said.   ``His ministry has been our largest single supplier of conventiondelegates. Make no mistake about it. Jimmy Swaggart was goodbusiness for Baton Rouge.   ``And he still is. He still draws. It just isn't what it used tobe,'' the visitor-bureau director added. ``And we've really hustledto try and book more groups and make up for what we lost from Mr.Swaggart's problems. Fortunately, we managed to land the U.S. HotAir Balloon National Championships for 1989-1991.''   Almost half the faculty has left the Jimmy Swaggart BibleCollege. Many left to save their credentials with the Assemblies ofGod, the denomination that defrocked Swaggart when he refused toaccept a one-year rehabilitation church leaders ordered.   Many have left the state for employment and schools elsewhere,dumping homes and apartments onto a real estate market alreadysuffering with the rest of Louisiana from the downturn in thestate's oil-based economy.   Faculty members from the Bible college are among about 600employees who have either been laid off or left Swaggart's employsince the ministry boasted in its 1986 heyday that its roster of1,400-plus employees and $16 million payroll had a ``snowball''spending effect that infused about $30.5 million into the BatonRouge economy.   Attendance at the college is off by about 75 percent _ from 1,450in 1987 to 400 now.   Since 1981, the ministry spent more than $123 million onconstruction and land purchases, making it the largest sponsor ofconstruction in East Baton Rouge Parish over the past five years.   But the first activity Swaggart's tearful confession stopped atthe complex was construction.   A new $9 million Bible college dormitory still standshalf-finished. Work was frozen and properties were mortgaged for $12million to cover construction debts, records show.   ``Jimmy still brings people in. He still makes business for BatonRouge,'' said Don Gerald Jr., vice president of a restaurant nearSwaggart's ministries.   But it's not what it used to be, Gerald said.</TEXT></DOC>
