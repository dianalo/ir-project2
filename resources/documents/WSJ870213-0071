Wharton Jr. was saluted at Carnegie Hall last week by a New York charities group for his achievements as an educator and businessman. He found the timing significant.    It was his first day as chairman and chief executive officer of Teachers Insurance andamp; Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund, whose $54 billion in assets makes it the nation's largest and perhaps most influential private pension fund.    Much is riding on Mr. Wharton's performance. His selection to head the higher education pension system, at a reported $500,000-a-year salary, thrusts a strong advocate of corporate social responsibility to the forefront of the growing controversy over the role of institutional investors in shaping social policies as well as corporate governance issues raised by takeovers.    Mr. Wharton will also be expected to bring some innovations of modern, flexible administrative techniques to the conservatively run fund, while assuaging critics who charge it isn't changing fast enough. In addition, the fact that Mr. Wharton is the first black person to run a major U.S. financial concern could, he says, make it easier for other blacks to achieve high corporate positions.    &quot;When you pioneer a new position it is very important that you succeed,&quot; says the 60-year-old former chancellor of the State University of New York, the nation's largest.    The concept of shareholder activism isn't new to TIAA-CREF. This spring, for example, it is sponsoring 14 shareholder resolutions asking companies doing business in South Africa to withdraw their operations. It is also sponsoring 10 shareholder resolutions opposing &quot;poison pill&quot; anti-takeover provisions.    Nevertheless, &quot;Cliff Wharton brings an extra measure of energy and experience to the area of corporate social responsibility,&quot; says Timothy Smith, executive director of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which represents church groups with $15 billion invested in equities. Mr. Wharton's selection, he adds, &quot;is a sign to corporations that corporate social responsibility won't be rolled back, but is growing.&quot;    Mr. Wharton declines to comment on the specific resolutions, which were inititiated under his predecessor, James G. MacDonald. The University of Chicago trained economist says it isn't his style to talk until fully informed about an issue. But he notes wryly: &quot;The position TIAA-CREF adopted on South Africa is one I advocated 2 1/2 years ago.&quot;    That combination of deliberate style and progressive ideas has won Mr. Wharton respect as a spokesman for higher education on issues of corporate responsibility and governance. &quot;Cliff does his homework, doesn't shoot from the hip and has a deep concern about higher education,&quot; says David Z. Robinson, executive vice president of the Carnegie Foundation, and a former Harvard classmate of Mr. Wharton's.    Mr. Wharton's first challenge, however, will be the rising criticism of the fund's retirement policies, which has been fueled by several critical studies in recent years.    A growing number of the 3,700 member institutions and one million policyholders are demanding that the fund expand investment offerings, modernize back-office operations and, most important, allow policyholders to transfer funds to and from third-party money managers. The fund's management has resisted these demands in the past on grounds that changes could undermine its ability to provide for policyholders' retirement needs.    Some institutions, including Stanford University, are considering suing the fund over these issues, but are waiting to see what Mr. Wharton will do first. &quot;A lot of people are asking (if) Wharton will have the freedom and flexibility to take on these issues,&quot; says Thomas C. Woodruff, executive director of the Commission on College Retirement, which authored most of the studies.    Mr. Wharton says he is looking at these issues and has begun to discuss them with interested parties. For now he seems to be moving cautiously. Mr. Wharton says that some people who know him regard him as a &quot;mover.&quot; But he also says, &quot;It's very easy to become mesmerized by short-term crises of the moment.&quot;    Others involved with the pension system's management say, however, that Mr. Wharton wasn't made chief executive to maintain the status quo. &quot;There was a very strong feeling that with financial deregulation and more knowledgeable policyholders, we had to have an agency that responds to the new environment,&quot; says Massachusetts Institute of Technology Prof. Phyllis A. Wallace, a trustee and member of the committee that nominated Mr. Wharton for the top job. She says he has the skills both to run the organization and to be an &quot;ambassador&quot; to policyholders.    It isn't the first time Mr. Wharton has managed a large institution beset with problems. When he became chancellor of SUNY in 1978, the sprawling 64-campus system was plagued by a lack of funds, an unwieldy bureaucracy and the perception that it no longer attracted the best students and faculty.    Mr. Wharton is widely credited with improving SUNY's funding and management, establishing a credible affirmative action effort for women and minority faculty and staff, and enhancing the system's academic reputation.    &quot;He was chancellor during a difficult time when the system could have Balkanized,&quot; says Nuala McGann Drescher, president of the SUNY faculty and staff union. &quot;His style and statesmanlike approach were crucial in keeping that from happening.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
