The U.S. currency's decline also occurred despite a statement by U.S. Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson warning against any further sharp decline in the dollar.    Mr. Johnson, speaking at a meeting of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives in Washington, said any further sharp declines in the dollar could undermine the stability of the financial system.    Currency dealers said the dollar at first rallied after the Commerce Department released its report on gross national product that showed the economy expanded at a surprisingly brisk 4.2% annual rate in the fourth quarter.    On the surface the report appeared to be good, but after close examination, dealers took another point of view.    Dealers noted the fact that the bulk of the $39.2 billion improvement in fourth-quarter growth came from a sharp $33.7 billion rise in inventories held by businesses. The report also showed that consumer spending plummeted by $24.1 billion, translating to an annual percentage rate decrease of 3.8%.    Ronald Sapiro, head trader for Continental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co., said the markets used their disappointment in the report as an excuse to dump dollars.    &quot;There haven't been a lot of reasons to sell dollars lately,&quot; partly because of fear of central-bank intervention, he said.    Mr. Sapiro predicted that central banks would intervene should the dollar continue to fall overnight.    The dollar was quoted at 1.6670 West German marks yesterday, down from 1.6729 marks late Tuesday in New York. The dollar was also quoted at 127.07 Japanese yen, down from 127.65 yen in New York late Tuesday.    In midmorning trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quoted at 127.20 yen.    In his remarks Wednesday, Mr. Johnson maintained that U.S. business and agriculture is competitive in world markets at the current exchange rate and said a further sharp drop in the dollar could lead to a breakdown of competitive discipline and would be symptomatic of growing inflationary pressures in the U.S.    But at the same time, the Fed official said the U.S. shouldn't target any particular dollar exchange rate. Rather, the authorities shouldn't henceforth pursue &quot;an aggressive lower dollar policy,&quot; he said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $2.10 an ounce to $467 in heavy trading. The estimated volume was six million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $467.80 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Wednesday, Jan. 27, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
