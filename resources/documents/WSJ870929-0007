Plant</HL><DD> 09/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GE </IN><DATELINE> FAIRFIELD, Conn.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   General Electric Co. said it will cut 1,150 jobs at its Cicero, Ill., refrigerator plant and will spend $160 million to expand refrigerator production at its Decatur, Ala., plant by 1990.    GE said the changes are being made to reduce the number of its major appliance plants, become more efficient and to accommodate design changes in GE's smaller sized refrigerators.    The Cicero plant will continue to employ 350 to make heating units for certain GE and Hotpoint appliances. Employment in Decatur will be expanded by 900 to 1,500 by 1990, GE said, but a spokesman said the company didn't expect many Cicero employees to transfer.    GE expects most dismissed Cicero employees will take advantage of an early retirement program or be retrained and placed in new jobs through joint GE and Illinois state employment programs. More than 400 employees in Cicero will be eligible to take a retirement bonus of $5,000, GE said, or payments amounting to 50% of their monthly pay while unemployed.    GE said it expects the package of benefits for dismissed Cicero employees will cost it about $25 million.    GE's stock closed in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday at $62.25 a share, up $1. </TEXT></DOC>
