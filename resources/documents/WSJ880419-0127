Edward Acker &quot;in connection with (his) termination&quot; as chairman, chief executive officer and a director of the parent and the airline, the company's proxy statement said.    Pan Am had a net loss of more than $265 million on revenue of $3.6 billion last year, and has been posting losses for several years.    Mr. Acker resigned from Pan Am Jan. 21 following board-room battles over whether to sell the airline. Mr. Acker favored selling Pan Am, but proposals to sell the carrier fell through.    Mr. Acker's principal opponent, vice chairman Martin Shugrue, who wanted to keep Pan Am independent, was paid $75,000 in connection with his resignation, also on Jan. 21, the proxy states.    Thomas Plaskett, Pan Am's new chairman and chief executive, will be paid $500,000 a year in salary and will be eligible for a bonus, the proxy states. In 1987, Mr. Acker's salary was $425,000. </TEXT></DOC>
