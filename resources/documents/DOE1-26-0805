The performance goals within this objective are: 1) forretrofit, 50-60% reduction of both SO/sub 2/ and NO/sub x/ from controlledlevels; 2) for new systems, 70-80% NO/sub x/ reduction and 70-90% SO/sub2/ reduction from uncontrolled levels; and 3) achievement of these goalsat costs at least $100/kWh less than the major technology alternative,FGD, and 30-50% less than the cost of FGD on a per ton of sulfur removalbasis. The program has been structured to give the best possibility ofachieving the stated goals with applicability to the major portion ofexisting boiler population. The major research objective is to providethe basis for widespread private sector commercialization based on successfuldemonstration on both a wall-fired and a tangentially fired boiler. Anessential supporting objective is to perform the generic research anddevelopment (R and D) necessary to ensure success of the demonstrationsand to maximize the sulfur capture potential of the technology. Othersupporting objectives are to integrate and generalize the R and D resultswith those from the demonstrations into a design methodology for assessingapplicability to any given boiler and to improve the SO/sub 2/ removalefficiency to 70-90% for new sources. To achieve these goals, activityhas been concentrated in four major areas: research and development support,demonstration of wall-fired boilers, development and demonstration ontangentially fired boilers, and process generalization.</TEXT></DOC>
