Details of the proposal were sketchy, and the meeting apparently hadn't reached an accord by early evening. But a source close to Turner Broadcasting said the proposal involved Turner Broadcasting issuing new equity, including new common and preferred stock.    The proposal, the source said, would limit dilution of Ted Turner's 81% stake in the cable-television concern of which he is chairman and chief executive officer.    As previously reported, Mr. Turner is asking the cable concerns -- the company's best customers -- for capital to help him pay debt and keep control of the Atlanta-based company. The aim is to raise at least $550 million to redeem all, or most, of the preferred stock Turner Broadcasting issued as part of the financing for its $1.5 billion acquisition of MGM/UA Entertainment Co.    The preferred stock is to begin paying dividends June 1 in the form of common shares. The dividend on the preferred, about half of which is held by investor Kirk Kerkorian, eventually could make Mr. Turner a minority shareholder in the company he built.    The new preferred currently being discussed wouldn't carry any dividend and would be antidilutive, sources said. Mr. Turner is said to be resigned to decreasing his stake in the company, but wouldn't allow it to drop below 51%.    Yesterday, in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, Turner Broadcasting common closed at $17.125, off $2, on volume of 41,800 shares.    Turner Broadcasting took on $1.4 billion of debt to buy MGM, and currently has about $1.35 billion of debt outstanding. The company has said it has sufficient cash flow to cover the debt payments, but is likely to report heavy losses as a result.    In the first nine months of 1986, interest expense of $143.6 million contributed to a net loss of $121.4 million, compared with net income of $5 million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier.    The leader in any cable investment group is expected to be the nation's largest cable company, Denver-based Tele-Communications Inc., which already owns about 3% of Turner Broadcasting.    Turner officials couldn't be reached for comment.    Industry executives noted that cable companies would be hesitant to invest in Turner Broadcasting without having some control over the company's operations.    Although it isn't likely that Mr. Turner would be forced out, the executives said, he would have to give up some of his managerial authority along with any holdings he sells to cable operators. &quot;Things would have to run like a constitutional monarchy rather than Turner's rule by divine right,&quot; one cable-industry executive said.    He added that if Mr. Turner doesn't reach an agreement with the cable operators &quot;it could open him up to a raid or a distress sale.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
