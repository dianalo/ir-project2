September delivery copper advanced 3.75 cents a pound to 95.35 cents. The final price was just below the day's high of 96.00 cents.    Analysts said the advance was purely technical and echoed several recent bounces after prices had sagged. &quot;The September contract found support in the area between 90.00 cents and 91.00 cents this week, last week and in July,&quot; said John Gross, president of J.E. Gross andamp; Associates Inc., metal industry consultants.    After dropping to as low as 90.15 cents on Tuesday and as low as 90.80 cents on Wednesday and holding there, the underlying strength attracted demand from commodity funds, which began buying aggressively, he said. This in turn, brought in widespread buying that boosted prices, according to Mr. Gross.    &quot;The rise is quite illogical, however,&quot; Mr. Gross said, noting that it occurred in the face of discount and prime rate increases, &quot;which will make it more expensive to buy and carry copper.&quot;    In addition, he noted that copper supplies are increasing and while demand &quot;can't be called bad, it is in its seasonal summer slowdown.&quot; He said both these factors normally &quot;would tend to mitigate against price increases.&quot;    U.S. producers, whose selling prices mostly were at about 95.00 cents a pound earlier in the week, have begun to come up to around $1.00 a pound, according to Mr. Gross. &quot;Producers, who peg their prices to those of futures, customarily wait until the futures market closes to announce their new quotations. I expected that $1.00 a pound will become general among producers,&quot; he said.    Robert Green, a copper consultant in Darien, Conn., observed that while demand for copper is lagging in the U.S. and Europe, there has been a recent pickup in buying from the Far East. &quot;That demand at least temporarily has slowed the inventory buildup,&quot; Mr. Green said.    Robert Wylde, president of R. J. Wylde Metals Inc., New York, metals brokers, said Far Eastern buying of copper, primarily from China, has been taking place over the last four weeks.    &quot;While traders have been hearing rumors of it, apparently it's only becoming better known now,&quot; he said.    One copper dealer observed that world inventory of the metal continues to be very low &quot;and we're about to enter the peak fall buying season. This could contribute to some temporary tightness and even shortages of copper. It could be that this also was on the minds of traders when they saw the kind of support the September future attracted as it dropped down near the 90-cent level,&quot; he said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Currency futures finished sharply stronger and near session highs after a busy buying spree in late trading. Undaunted by a string of prime rate increases to 10% by U.S. banks yesterday and Tuesday's increase in the discount rate to 6 1/2%, traders scrambled to cover their short currency futures positions. &quot;Nobody knows what hit them,&quot; a New York trader said. Traders say a number of ingredients contributed to the rally, including Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl's comments, in an interview in the Aug. 22 issue of Forbes magazine, that a higher dollar &quot;doesn't serve anyone's interests.&quot; His comments echo statements made by West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg, which initially put currencies on the road higher overnight. Mr. Stoltenberg said a dollar rise above 1.90 marks could have a negative impact on the West German economy and interest rates. September mark futures closed .0073 higher at .5328 after trading between .5269 and .5335. Among other front-month contracts, the yen finished .0072 cents stronger at .007573, and the pound closed .0166 higher at 1.7096.    ENERGY: Oil prices languished in lackluster trading yesterday as market participants continue to assess the impact on Middle Eastern strife of the proposed Iran-Iraq cease-fire. Much of the light trading activity was inspired by chartwatchers who buy and sell on technical signals. Major oil companies appeared to have little interest in either buying or selling oil futures contracts. But &quot;prices are expected to work their way higher in the near-term,&quot; said Chris McCormack, broker for the international energy desk at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. He explained that technical factors in the market were positive as well as reports that oil production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had slackened.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle futures prices sank in light volume as traders took profits on Wednesday's rally. Prices had risen sharply in mid-week on signs that retailers were beginning to increase their purchases of beef in anticipation of the Labor Day holiday. Hog futures prices rose. </TEXT></DOC>
