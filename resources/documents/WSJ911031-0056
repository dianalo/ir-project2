But the dollar rose against the yen in cross, ornon-dollar, trading as traders used the U.S. currency as amedium to buy marks and sell yen.</LP><TEXT>   Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6720 marks,down from 1.6861 marks late Tuesday in New York. The U.S.currency also was changing hands at 131.03 yen, up from130.62 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.7435, up from $1.7295.   In Tokyo early Thursday, the dollar was trading at 130.85yen, down from Tokyo's close Wednesday of 131.05 yen.Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.6725 marks,down from 1.6872 marks at Wednesday's close.   The mark was quoted at 78.45 yen late yesterday, up from77.46 yen late Tuesday in New York.   Currency traders said that when the Fed didn't drainreserves from the domestic money market, as had beenexpected, it signaled a new target rate of 5.0% for federalfunds, the rate banks charge one another for overnight loans.   The target rate had been 5.25%, and traders will bewatching the funds rate today for confirmation of the new,lower target.   &quot;Interest-rate differentials moved decidedly against thedollar,&quot; said Earl I. Johnson, vice president at Harris Trustandamp; Savings Bank in Chicago. German overnight rates have beenaround 8.60% to 8.70%, or about 3.4 percentage points higherthan the federal funds rate. That spread has widened toaround 3.65 percentage points, making the German currencyeven more attractive to investors.   Despite the reduction in U.S. interest rates, the dollaris expected to trade between 1.6550 marks and 1.7000 marksand 130.50 yen and 131.50 yen in the next several days.   Traders said the federal funds easing could be theharbinger of a cut in the discount rate tomorrow. Manytraders said they now expect a reduction in the discount ratefrom its current level of 5.0% after the release tomorrow ofdata for U.S. non-farm payrolls for October.   The Fed seems to be &quot;lining {itself} up for adiscount-rate cut on Friday,&quot; said Geoffrey Dennis, aninternational economist at James Capel.   Mr. Dennis said the Fed could cut the discount rate, whichis the rate the Fed charges banks, by as much as a halfpercentage point.   The combination of a quarter-percentage-point cut in thefederal funds rate, plus a discount rate cut, would triggerbanks to reduce their prime lending rates, Mr. Dennis said.   The Fed wants a &quot;double whammy to make sure banks pass{the cuts} on to customers,&quot; Mr. Dennis said.   Traders said the Fed could allow the federal funds rate toslide another half percentage point as well tomorrow.   But David Gilmore, senior foreign exchange analyst at MCMCurrencyWatch in New York, said that while a discount ratecut is possible, he doesn't think it will come on the heelsof tomorrow's employment report.   The Fed doesn't want to appear prone to having a&quot;knee-jerk reaction&quot; after one bad economic number, he said.   Mr. Gilmore cited remarks made yesterday by Fed GovernorJohn LaWare before the U.S. League of Savings Institutions,and said the monetary official didn't &quot;appear to be endorsingaggressive Fed easing.&quot;   Mr. LaWare said that he believes a relatively slow rate ofreal economic growth for the U.S. economy is &quot;desirable&quot; inthe current circumstances.   Mr. LaWare justified the desirability of relatively slowgrowth by saying there is a need to keep inflationarypressures contained.   Traders said they don't expect the dollar to fall through1.6500 marks, even if the Fed decides to pare interest rateson Friday.   The federal funds reduction was built into the dollar'sexchange rates, and was further absorbed in the day's fall,said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High FrequencyEconomics in New York.   He said the dollar's drop was in part a speculative move,and that it wasn't likely to direct the currency on a newdownward course.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $359 an ounce, down 60 cents. Estimatedvolume was a light 2.1 million ounces.   In Hong Kong on Thursday, gold was quoted at $358.85 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
