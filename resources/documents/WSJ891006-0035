OPEC and the 12-nation community share an interest in stability and in avoiding the oil-price surges of previous years, the Indonesian official said. In light of the community's plan to create a single market by the end of 1992, &quot;it is essential that oil prices be as stable as possible,&quot; said EC Energy Commissioner Antonia Cardoso e Cunha.    Analysts said it isn't clear what effect, if any, cooperation between Europe and OPEC would have on the oil market. But OPEC's effort to talk formally for the first time with European Community officials is &quot;interesting for what it tells about OPEC thinking,&quot; said David Gray, an analyst with James Capel andamp; Co. in London.    Mr. Gray said the move indicates that at least some OPEC members are satisfied with current oil prices of around $18 a barrel and would rather boost export volumes at relatively low but stable prices than force price increases that discourage consumption. Mr. Gray said this contradicts what he called the widely accepted belief that oil prices will rise in the 1990s.    OPEC supplies about half of the EC's oil needs, and many expect that the 13-nation oil cartel will play an even greater role in the late 1990s when non-OPEC production declines. OPEC &quot;wants to guarantee a market&quot; in the EC, said Peter Nicol, an analyst with S.G. Warburg Securities Co. in London. </TEXT></DOC>
