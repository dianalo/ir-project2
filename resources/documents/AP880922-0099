The Ostersunds Post said 400 reindeer were discarded in thenorthern province of Jamtland after the annual slaughter when testson the meat disclosed cesium levels ranging up to 4,500 Becquerelsper pound.   A Becquerel is a unit to describe the activity of radioactivesubstance. The approved government limit for the meat forconsumption is about 680 Becquerels per pound.   ``I'm beginning to lose faith that there is a future in raisingreindeer,'' said Thomas Ahstrand, 22, a herder reached by telephonein his village of Frostviken.   About 10 percent of Sweden's total reindeer slaughter was bannedfor eating, the Ostersunds Post said.   ``We raise reindeer for the garbage dumps. There is no sign thatthe cesium levels are being reduced by even a few Becquerels,''said Ahstrand, who bought his first herd of 50 animals just beforethe Chernobyl nuclear plant in the Soviet Ukraine sent up a cloudof radioactivity in April 1986.   Thirty-one people died in the world's worst nuclear plantdisaster.   Sweden was badly affected by fallout because of a freak windthat carried the radioactive isotope cesium 137 over a belt of thenorthern and central regions. Sweden's 300,000 reindeer wereparticularly vulnerable because they feed on lichen, which soaks upcesium and is slow to dispose of the contamination.   The Swedish government compensates the herders at market pricesfor the destroyed meat, but the semi-nomadic Lapps, or Samis asthey prefer to call themselves, say their lifestyle has beenthreatened.   ``We ask ourselves how long will the government keep onsupporting us,'' said Ahstrand.   Last year Ahstrand and other herdsmen rescued part of theirreindeer by moving them 250 miles south to graze in anuncontaminated region. But the move was costly and difficult, andthe herdsmen stayed home this year.   ``We felt that we didn't belong there. We have lived in themountains for so many centuries tending our herds among thesefields, it is more than an occupation. It's a way of life,'' saidAhstrand.</TEXT></DOC>
