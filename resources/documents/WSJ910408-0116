The Army's announcement last Friday picking thecontractors' design caps a six-year competition to secure oneof the largest prizes left in the Pentagon's shrinkingprocurement budget. More broadly, it could trigger a shakeoutamong U.S. helicopter manufacturers as orders forolder-design military choppers dry up.</LP><TEXT>   If everything falls into place, the two winningcontractors and a host of subcontractors -- led by MartinMarietta Corp., Harris Corp., TRW Inc., and WestinghouseElectric Corp. -- could garner more than $30 billion in newbusiness over the next two decades.   But budget pressures and congressional criticism, whichalready have forced the Pentagon to sharply scale back andrevamp the light helicopter project a number of times,threaten to make the Army's top-priority acquisition programa flashpoint in budget debates year after year.   The Army's initial contract, valued at $2.8 billion, callsfor Boeing and United Technologies' Sikorsky unit to buildand test six LH prototypes through the end of 1994. Beatingout a team led by McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Textron Inc.'sBell helicopter unit, however, simply gives the winningcontractors a chance to prove that their high-tech helicopterwill perform as advertised while meeting stringent costgoals.   The contractors so far have built only LH mock-ups.Low-rate production isn't scheduled to begin for six moreyears, and the Pentagon's spending plans include less than$1.2 billion through the end of 1993.   &quot;It's our burden now,&quot; Eugene Buckley, Sikorsky'spresident, acknowledged during an interview. &quot;We've got tomake sure we don't surprise ourselves or our customer&quot; byallowing costs to spiral out of control.   Friday's announcement, in fact, was almost delayed becauseof last-minute questions by senior Pentagon officials aboutthe extent of the government's financial risk duringdevelopment. The contracts won't be signed until DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney is briefed on those details later thisweek.   Unlike many of the large development programs of the1980s, which demanded that contractors bear most of thefinancial risk and make heavy up-front investments, the LHpact is expected to provide Boeing and Sikorsky a chance forsubstantial profits if costs are held down. But by the sametoken, federal oversight will be more extensive than in thepast.   Army officials indicated that the winning design waspicked largely because of projected lower maintenance costsand the relative ease with which important parts could bechecked and replaced in the field.   For Boeing in particular, the LH award &quot;is very, verykey,&quot; said Edward Renouard, president of the Seattlecompany's helicopter division, which is located nearPhiladelphia. The unit, which has about $800 million inannual sales, has one main product, the CH-47 Chinook. Andalthough Boeing has contracts to upgrade the Vietnam War-eraArmy chopper through 1993 and can expect some foreign salesto keep the line going, the company's wherewithal to remain ahelicopter builder into the late 1990s was somewhat in doubt.Boeing, which had corporatewide sales of $28 billion in 1990,doesn't have any commercial helicopter lines to fall back onas the military budget shrinks.   Sikorsky has a much broader product base. It buildsBlackhawk and Seahawk helicopters, both of which are goingstrong, as well as heavy-lift choppers. Overall, the Sikorskyunit accounts for slightly less than a tenth of UnitedTechnologies' $21.4 billion in revenue. Sikorsky willessentially build the LH airframe and Boeing is responsiblefor the bulk of the avionics and electronics.   Featuring composite materials, sophisticated computers,protection from chemical or biological weapons, and afan-in-the-tail design rather than the traditional rearrotor, the LH is intended to penetrate deep into enemyterritory and avoid detection by relying on speed and quieteroperation. More accurate and easier to maneuver than thecurrent generation of aircraft, it is supposed to replace thethousands of Vietnam War-era scout and light attack choppersthat are the workhorses of Army aviation.   The losers tried to play down the LH decision, even thoughthey've poured hundreds of millions of dollars into theirhelicopter's ill-fated design. Thomas Gunn, president ofMcDonnell Douglas's helicopter unit, said his company stillhas more than 150 Apache attack choppers to build, and thenseveral hundred to upgrade. In addition, the company'scommercial helicopter backlog is strong. Similarly, Bellpointed out that much of its Cobra military helicopterbusiness is overseas, and more than half of its revenue comesfrom the commercial market.   Nonetheless, Stephen Conver, the Army's top acquisitionofficial, acknowledged that Army officials are worried aboutthe domestic industry's health. Reduced military budgets meanthat the Army won't be able to &quot;keep all four of our majorhelicopter manufacturers fully in business,&quot; he said at abriefing.   Last year, Defense Secretary Cheney stretched out andslashed proposed LH purchases to less than 1,300 from about2,100. But program critics -- led by Rep. Larry Hopkins (R.,Ky.) -- maintain further cuts are necessary because the LH istoo expensive and its technology too risky.   &quot;There's no question that it's gonna be tough&quot; to securehefty funding for the helicopter, predicted Sen. DennisDeConcini (D., Ariz.), one of the LH's early backers. &quot;Idon't know what I would have done,&quot; Sen. DeConcini conceded,if the team including McDonnell Douglas, which planned toassemble the LH in Arizona, had won the competition. &quot;I guessI would have just started working my tail off.&quot;   ---                       Chopper Power                                                                                                          Characteristics of the Army's next-generation lighthelicopter:                                                                                                          Dash speed                           More than 170 knots   Fuel endurance                       2.5 hours   Range*                               1,260 nautical miles   Empty weight                         7,500 pounds                                                                                                          *With external fuel                                                                                                          Source: Boeing-Sikorsky marketing material</TEXT></DOC>
