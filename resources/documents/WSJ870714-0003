Col. Oliver North testified that there were lapses in the supervision of funds in the Iran-Contra operation and that he engaged a British security company for sabotage missions into Nicaragua without receiving specific approval beforehand.    Appearing before House and Senate committees investigating the controversy, the Marine officer's testimony came as investigators released previously classified papers linking the National Security Council to a State Department office that awarded contracts to conservative activists.    These activists assisted Col. North in funneling money to the Contras in 1985 and 1986. The documents include financial records detailing the flow of U.S. contributions back and forth from a Cayman Islands account that was used in arming the insurgents.    Col. North is expected to conclude his testimony this morning, and committee leaders announced last night that former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane will immediately follow in what promises to be a sharp rebuttal of his former aide on key points. Rear Adm. John Poindexter, who succeeded Mr. McFarlane at the NSC in late 1985, will testify tomorrow. These back-to-back appearances by the two former NSC advisers will be a major test of the young Marine officer who served them through the Iran-Contra affair.    While providing little detail about the sabotage missions into Nicaragua, Col. North confirmed yesterday that he had played a direct role in bringing British operatives into the Nicaraguan war as a means of bolstering the image of resistance forces and to help fight Soviet-made helicopters used by the Sandinistas.    David Walker, a special-operations veteran with past ties to the Thatcher government, has been linked in previous testimony to the Contras, and Col. North said Mr. Walker's organization was involved with &quot;internal operations in Managua and elsewhere.&quot;    In his testimony yesterday, Col. North appeared to describe looser reins on the tightly controlled operating style he has said he followed in the White House, stating he was sometimes guided by a rule that &quot;unless otherwise directed, I will proceed.&quot;    No date was given for the sabotage missions, but prior testimony has established that Mr. Walker's role in supporting the Contras was discussed in the NSC as early as late 1984. Col. North's earliest known memorandum on the matter was addressed to Mr. McFarlane, but he said yesterday that he had informed Adm. Poindexter at some point of his desire to use the British company. &quot;Did he ever tell you he approved that?&quot; asked House Majority Leader Thomas Foley. &quot;He never told me not to,&quot; the Marine answered.    Committee sources later said the colonel may have been confused and meant for this answer to apply to Mr. McFarlane.    Mr. Foley's exchange was one of the few cases of pointed questioning yesterday, as committee members appeared to use the hearings less to engage Col. North directly than to rebut -- or compliment -- his rhetoric.    &quot;In America, disagreement with the policies of the government is not evidence of lack of patriotism,&quot; said Sen. George Mitchell (D., Maine). In blunter terms, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Dante Fascell sought to express his disquiet with the colonel's claims over five days of dramatic testimony. &quot;I keep asking myself, how come I don't feel good?&quot; the Florida Democrat said.    The most detailed information yesterday came from testimony and documents related to the financial transactions behind the arms sales, as well as the parallel effort to raise funds in the U.S. for the insurgents.    &quot;I never set out in any of this activity to make anybody rich,&quot; Col. North said. He admitted, however, that the standard accounting practices for covert operations weren't applied to the shell companies he oversaw with retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord. The committees have established that private operators linked to Gen. Secord took profits as high as 40% on arms provided to the Contras. Col. North disclaimed any knowledge of these transactions or why more than $8 million remained in foreign accounts when the operation ended last fall.    Col. North has denied ever directly soliciting contributions for the insurgents, but the documents released yesterday tighten the links between the NSC and conservative activists who benefited from contracts granted by the State Department's Latin American public diplomacy office.    A previously classified memo, dated last Aug. 7, portrays the office as part of an interagency group reporting &quot;directly to the NSC.&quot; Col. North testified that he didn't recall assisting in the award of the contracts but acknowledged that he may have intervened to expedite payments to benefit Richard Miller, an activist in the network and principal in the Washington-based firm International Business Communications.    At Col. North's direction, Mr. Miller established a Cayman Islands corporation used to funnel contributions to the Nicaraguan Democratic Force and to Swiss accounts used by Gen. Secord's operation for a covert airlift carrying arms to the guerrillas.    Letters thanking contributors &quot;in helping our President in this vital endeavor&quot; were signed by Col. North, and the records detail how money ostensibly contributed for &quot;humanitarian&quot; purposes was moved back and forth, in some cases eventually buying arms and even returning to the U.S. to a nonprofit foundation believed to be part of a lobbying effort on behalf of the Contras.    Mr. Miller appears to have been a conduit as well for a secret &quot;non-military&quot; action inside Nicaragua. Investigators have focused on a transfer of an estimated $100,000 in stock to the Heritage Foundation in September 1985 from a wealthy Pittsburgh investment executive. Heritage subsequently made an equal award to a foundation linked to Mr. Miller and International Business Communications, but it isn't clear how much of this money ever reached Nicaragua.    An estimated $20,000 is believed to have been kept by Mr. Miller and his associates, investigators say, and at least $7,000 was transferred through the Cayman Islands account to the Swiss accounts used by the Secord arms network.    A Heritage Foundation official said the purpose of its award had been for research. Sources said there is some evidence that the transfers were intended to be part of a surreptitious effort to assist political opponents to the Sandinista government in the Catholic Church. Investigators, however, said there is no certainty that any of the funds were ever used for this purpose.    Col. North refused to comment on what he indicated was a classified operation. The documents show he subsequently drafted a letter to be signed by President Reagan thanking the contributor, but it is unclear if the message was ever sent.    Lawmakers yesterday expressed their disappointment that the administration hadn't notified congressional leaders about the covert Iran-Contra operation, but continued to compliment Col. North. Rep. William Broomfield (R., Mich.) said the administration's &quot;most serious and grievous error in this whole thing&quot; was its failure to consult Congress. Both he and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) said they didn't want to see Col. North prosecuted for his activities.    However, Rep. Jack Brooks, the crusty Texas Democrat, didn't use kid gloves in questioning Col. North. His approach sparked a brief, heated exchange with Col. North's attorney, Brendan Sullivan. Rep. Brooks said he didn't vote to grant immunity for Col. North because he believed &quot;government officials should be fully accountable for their actions,&quot; and he questioned why the Marine needed the protection.    Those remarks drew a reprimand from the feisty Mr. Sullivan, who suggested that Rep. Brooks might need to bone up on the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. That prompted Mr. Brooks to complain, &quot;I've had quite enough listening&quot; to Mr. Sullivan. &quot;We didn't hire him as our lawyer, and I don't need him to advise me.&quot;    Referring to Col. North's shredding of government documents, Rep. Brooks suggested that he violated a 1978 law that prohibits destruction of such documents unless certain conditions were met.    Warren Rudman, the New Hampshire Republican who is vice chairman of the Senate panel, acknowledged that Congress had flip-flopped on the Contra-aid issue over the years. But he told Col. North that the majority of Americans haven't supported helping the Contras, and &quot;the American people have the constitutional right to be wrong.&quot;    And Sen. Rudman suggested that the White House, once the scandal broke open last November, intended to make Col. North the scapegoat, noting that Adm. Poindexter was allowed to &quot;gracefully resign,&quot; while Col. North was fired.    Separately, the White House, in one of its rare comments on allegations emerging from the Iran-Contra hearings, insisted yesterday that a controversial memo that outlined a briefing for Mr. Reagan never mentioned the diversion of Iranian arms-sales profits to the Contras.    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reasserted that Mr. Reagan &quot;was never briefed on diversions or any other excess funds.&quot; Mr. Fitzwater said a Sept. 15, 1986, memo in which Col. North recommends a briefing for the president on covert operations &quot;never mentions diversions or residuals.&quot; Mr. Fitzwater refused to say whether the president ever received a briefing as a result of the memo, which Col. North sent to Adm. Poindexter. </TEXT></DOC>
