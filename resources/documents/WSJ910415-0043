In return, thegovernment agreed not to try him on more than a dozen othercounts of alleged fraud.   The trader, David Zatz, was sentenced to six months ofcommunity service for making a so-called accommodation tradein 1988 with a federal agent who had posed as a futurestrader. The trade, which violated Merc rules at the time,didn't result in any customer losses.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Zatz was one of 48 individuals indicted by a federalgrand jury in 1989 for alleged futures trading fraud as aresult of an undercover investigation of crime in the tradingpits. More than half of those indicted pleaded guilty, orwere found guilty at trial, to defrauding customers.   Mr. Zatz, who couldn't be reached for comment, was one ofthree traders in Swiss francs who were tried last summer onfraud charges. The jury at that trial in federal court heredeadlocked on two-thirds of the charges against the traders,didn't find Mr. Zatz guilty of any charges, and found his twoco-defendants, Robert Mosky and Daniel Scheck, guilty on afew counts.   Mr. Zatz pleaded guilty to the reduced charge rather thanface retrial on the deadlocked counts. Earlier this year theother co-defendants also pleaded guilty to sharply reducedcharges.</TEXT></DOC>
