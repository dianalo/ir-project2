 They are not huge, complex managementpackages.andP;  Nevertheless, they can become indispensable.andM;Users and administrators have come to rely on similar utilities in the DOSworld.andP;  Locating files can be much easier with the proper utility.andP;  That'snot to say you can't search though every directory to find a file, it's awhole lot faster to use LOCATE.COM or some equivalent program.andP;  The same goesfor moving files.andP;  And changing attributes.andM;This article concentrates on software that helps network managers performtheir essential tasks, programs that generate references: real-time graphs,onscreen summaries, or hard-copy reports (logs, audit trails, documentation,and the like) of disk usage, server status, user activities, transactions,network configuration, and network installation.andP;  A few enhancement tools arecovered, too.andM;Reporting ToolsandM;Documenting a NetWare LAN isn't easy.andP;  A manager must jump through menus tofind out what the users are doing.andP;  If he wants a hard copy, he could spendhours getting into menus, making print screens, and entering yet anotherSYSCON or FILER menu.andP;  Enter reporting tools: Frye, LT Stat, and Lomax.andM;Frye Computer Systems (Boston) is the newest of these utilities.andP;  Itsreporting package offers real-time, cumulative data on the state of thenetwork.andP;  The Frye Utilities for Networks v1.0 generates 20 comprehensivereports on system configuration, maintenance, and errors.andM;Frye Utilities gives you the same statistics that Lomax Utilities and LTStat+ do, and more.andP;  Frye organizes the information so that even networkneophytes can solve problems.andM;The software consists of 12 modules that categorize and provide at least 60different statistics.andP;  Frye shows the status and activity of the server,connections, users, groups, volumes, disks, channels, cache, andtransactions, as well as version information, reports, and configurationdata.andM;Th Server module has five submenus.andP;  The first, General, graphs serveractivity in real time in one-second increments.andP;  General also includes suchstatistics as disk I/O pending, service processes, and total server memory.andM;The Resources submenu shows how close your server is to reaching limitsimposed by NetWare.andP;  It displays connections, open files, indexed files,bindery objects, and routing buffers.andM;The Packets submenu lists total file service packets, total other packets,file service packets buffered, and unsupported connections.andP;  The Filessubmenu includes peak, current, and total open files.andP;  The Drivers submenushows the configuration of the LAN drivers(s) that your server uses.andM;The Connections module has five submenus.andP;  Activity displays the user name oneach connection, the node, how many files are open, a bar graph of thatuser's activity, and the amount of time since that user last sent a requestto the file server.andP;  The graph shows up to 16 users' activity onscreen atonce.andM;Usage shows when users logged in and the amount of activity they havegenerated since login.andP;  Three menus give you the names of the files the userhas open, the task numbers he has, and the semaphores he owns.andM;The Users module displays such facts as the hexidecimal user ID and name,full name, whether the account is disabled, and the date the account expires.andO;For each user, it reports groups, security equivalences, trustee assignments,login restrictions, and the login script.andM;The Groups module gives name, Novell ID, and whether it has a consoleoperator privileges, members, and trustee assignments.andM;The volumes module shows information about the volumes and physical drives.andO;Statistics include volume name and number, logical, physical, and mirrordrive numbers, total disk space, and number of free directory entries.andM;The Disks module shows in a tree diagram the configuration of physical diskdrives and their volumes, including the drive number, disk channel, andcontroller number and type.andP;  It also includes a hot fix table.andP;  The Channelmodule shows the status and configuration of the server's disk controllers.andM;The Cache module displays four sections of statistics.andP;  The first sectionlists the number of cache buffers, buffer size, total cache size, and numberof dirty buffers.andP;  The second part reports information pertaining to the hitrate while the third part lists the numbers of physical read and writerequests and errors, get requests, full and partial write requests,background dirty and aged writes, and total cache writes and allocations.andO;The fourth section includes counts on thrashing, dirty LRU blocks, readsbeyond write, fragmented writes, hit on unavailable, and scrapped blocks.andO;The Transactions module shows the status of Novell's Transaction TrackingSystem (TTS).andM;With the Reports module, you can produce six documents.andP;  The weekly systemmaintenance report lists disk errors, hot fix usage, space and directoryentries remaining on volumes, key disk cache, transaction tracking, and LANI/O statistics, user information, and server resource limits.andP;  The systemexceptions report covers the same topics as the first report, but shows onlyinformation highlighting problems.andP;  The disk utilization reports show thespace used on each volume.andM;Eleven configuration reports are available: comprehensive configuration,configuration information, network generation, system and user login scriptlist, defined users, user configuration, defined groups, group configuration,system files lists, and column directory structure.andP;  The network generationreport saves and organizes the options chosen during setup to make it easy touse Netgen to recreate your server configuration.andP;  This report also serves asdocumentation of the installation procedure.andP;  The Frye Utilities is priced at$495 for a single-server license.andM;The Lomax Utilities from J.A.andP;  Lomax (Novato, Calif.) consolidatesinformation on disk usage, system security, accounting, and audit trails into19 reports.andP;  The package's 13 programs may be run from the command line orfrom menus.andM;Ndisk gives information on server disk volumes, such as volume size, totalspace in use, the total entries in use, and entries allocated for use.andP;  Ittabulates each sudirectory's name, file sizes, number of files, spaceoccupied, and percentage used on the volume.andM;The Nfile utility lists file name, size, owner, last access date, date oflast update, and creation date.andP;  It also tabulates file attributes.andM;For each user, Nuser shows login ID, access rights the user has or has hadrevoked, full name, trustee rights, and hexadecimal user ID.andM;Ndir reports information on subdirectories.andP;  For each, it lists the login IDsof trustees who have been granted or had revoked rights to the subdirectory,the owner's name, date created, and maximum rights allowed.andM;Nspac displays user information followed by subdirectory information.andP;  Userinformation includes the user's login ID, user's full name, and thesubdirectories containing the user's files and the number of files owned.andO;Subdirectory information includes the volume name, number of files, aggregatesize of files, and space used.andM;Nset shows a particular user's login ID, user ID (in hexidecimal), and fullname, followed by the login script.andM;Nsecu displays security information.andP;  It lists the dates the account and thepassword expires, whether the account is disabled, the number of times a usercan log in with an expired password, password expiration intervals, and whocan change the password.andP;  Nsecu also illustrates allowed login times inmatrix form.andM;Nacctu shows each user's login ID, full name, account balance, lowest balanceallowed, and the credit available.andM;Nsecs produces three reports.andP;  The Autoexec and Setlogin reports simplyretrieve two script files--AUTOEXEC.SYS and NET$LOG.DAT--And display theinformation on hard copy.andM;The third report, &quot;Network Server Security Report,&quot; contains the defaults thesystem administrator has assigned to new users.andP;  It includes details similarto the Nacctu report.andM;Naccts shows NetWare 2.1's five charge matrices for accounting: connect time,disk blocks read, disk blocks written, server requests made, and diskstorage.andP;  Each matrix contains rate number, days and times, and charge rates.andM;Naudit tracks logins and logouts (by station and user), bytes read andwritten, server connect time and requests, and disk blocks stored.andP;  It liststime, date, station, server ID and name, and login ID.andM;Nlist shows all users' login IDs and full names.andP;  Ngroup displays all groups'names, members, and full names.andP;  The Lomax Utilities costs $295 per LAN.andM;LT Stat+ v2.1 from Blue Lance (Houston) produces more than 25 reports onconfiguration, security, disk utilization, accounting, and serverperformance.andP;  Similar to the Lomax Utilities, the program can be run frommenus or called from batch files that use the program's command-lineinterface.andM;LT Stat+ and Lomax generate similar statistical reports, but differ inorganization and in quantity of details.andP;  For configuration and security,Blue Lance's package offers separate configuration reports on the server,users, groups, trustee assignments, and effective rights.andP;  It also lets yousave NetWare menus in a file, view or print the NetWare error/message logfile, or see the system and user login scripts.andM;The user configuration report includes password, trustee assignments, groupmemberships, security equivalences, group trustee rights, user login script,and LT Auditor filter (if LT Auditor is installed), in addition to user name,full name, and ID.andM;The group configuration report lists name, full name, ID, trusteeassignments, and members.andP;  The trustee assignment report provides trusteeassignments for each user and group.andP;  The user and group configurationreports also contain this information, but the trustee assignment reportcombines them here in a different format.andM;Effective-rights report helps the network manager confirm that periodicchanges to the system configuration did not alter the intended effectiverights for each user at the directory level.andP;  It also shows user trusteeassignments, group trustee assignments, and maximum directory rights fromFiler for each user and directoryandM;To examine disk utilization, you can use LT Stat+ to report size, creationdates, and owner names for directories, volumes, and files.andP;  You can alsoprint lists of duplicate or old files.andM;The directory utilization report shows information about directories at thefile level, including the number of files in a directory and file sizes.andP;  Italso provides information at the user level.andM;The volume utilization report can be in summary or detailed form.andP;  It givesdisk space use at the directory level.andP;  For each volume, the detailed formshows creation date, number of files, directory size, owner, and path.andM;The user utilization report can also be in summary or detailed form.andP;  Summarylists the number of directories, number of files, space used, and percentageos space used.andP;  The detailed report includes all files and reports the dateeach file was last accessed and updated.andM;The duplicate file report identifies the number of file duplications andtheir directories and owner, by file name and extension.andP;  The last updatedfile report shows which files, by user or directory, have not been updatedsince a date specified by the supervisor.andP;  The supervisor may then requestthat users mark these files to be deleted or archived.andM;LT Stat's five charge rates reports display a grid containing half-hourlyincrements and days of the week to facilitate chargeback for use of networkresources.andP;  These accounting reports are nearly identical to Lomax's Nacctureports, except they don't include the date and time the report ran.andM;For information on server performance, LT Stat offers four reports.andP;  First,the cache statistics report includes the number of buffers, buffer size,dirty buffers, cache read and write requests, hits and misses, physical readand write requests, physical errors, and much more.andP;  Second, the LAN I/Ostatistics report gives total packets received, file service packets, packetswith invalid slots, invalid connections, and much more.andP;  Third, the summaryreport shows the number of service processes, server utilization, totalpackets received, total number of cache buffers, and other details.andP;  Fourth,the file system statistics reports on maximum open files, peak open files,currently open files, total files open, and total read and write requests.andM;Additional reports include disk statistics, channel statistics, volume,connection, and disk mapping information, and transaction trackingstatistics.andM;Earlier versions of LT Stat+ had incompatibility problems with some IBMcompatibles; to ameliorate the problem, version 2.1 comes with overlay filestailored to formerly incompatible machines.andP;  LT Stat+ costs $295 per server,and is not RAM-resident.andM;Audit TrailsandM;Whereas reporting utilities focus on server and user resources, audit trailsrecord what the users are doing on the network.andP;  Who is logged on?andP;  Whatfiles are they opening?andP;  What applications are they using?andP;  Three audittrails are discussed: LT Auditor, LANtrail, and NetLog.andM;The multiserver version of LT Auditor from Blue Lance reports user and fileactivities at all the network servers.andP;  The software records who accesseswhich files and subdirectories on which servers.andP;  It even records when a userwith supervisory privileges accesses LT Auditor.andM;With the multiserver version of LT Auditor, when a network user logged in ata primary server logs into a second server and accesses files, their primaryserver is identified and recorded with the rest of their transactions.andO;LANtrail from NMI/LAN Services (New York) reports on one server at a time.andM;LT Auditor tracks any combination of eight operations: the opening, closing,erasing, renaming, writing, or creating of files and the making or deletingof subdirectories.andP;  By defining &quot;filters,&quot; network managers specify whichfile operations, subdirectories, users, groups, and files to audit.andP;  Audittrails gather a tremendous amount of information, which a busy networkadministrator rarely has time to study.andP;  With filters, you only get theinformation you need.andM;As users access files, LT Auditor filters and instantaneously records theinformation in two audit-history files.andP;  One contains a list of fileaccesses; the other, a list of LAN accesses.andM;Using these two data files, LT Auditor prints two reports.andP;  The file accessreport displays user name, station number, server number, date, time, fileoperation, file name, and path.andP;  LT Auditor can generate file access reportssorted by user, date, or audited filename; it sorts and indexes reports asnew file activities occur, are recorded, and are added to the report.andM;The LAN access report shows user name, station number, and time and date oflogin and logout.andP;  This report also displays unexpected conditions, such aswhen a user reboots without logging out or when a user tries to login at twoworkstations.andM;The &quot;purge active files&quot; command deletes the file- and LAN-access historylogs after you have archived them.andP;  LT Auditor prompts you to archive andpurge these files when either reaches a maximum size specified by thesupervisor or when the automatic archiving fails because archive-disk spaceis full.andP;  It can also purge files automatically.andM;LT Auditor works with any version of NetWare.andP;  The multiserver version costs$595.andP;  A single-server version is available for $495 per server.andM;LANtrail makes NetWare network audit trails and produces reports, as well astracks disk usage and security.andP;  LANtrail and LT Auditor offer many of thesame features, though there are several differences.andM;As with LT Auditor, you can trace a user's ID and physical workstation, loginand logout times, and all file and directory activity.andP;  LANtrail tracks whatfiles users opened, read, wrote to, closed, created, deleted, and renamed.andO;It monitors what directories were created, deleted, and renamed and whatprograms users executed.andP;  It also tracks changes to the network security andmakes use of the system error log that Novell maintains.andM;LANtrail outputs security and system management reports containinginformation about the network's activity and environment.andP;  The networkmanager can generate a report for a particular user, group, directory name,or a combination of these.andP;  You can specify the report's date range, whatfile specifications to match, and other criteria.andP;  Like LT Auditor, LANtrailhas a batch mode of report generation to automate routine audits.andM;LANtrail and LT Auditor are very different.andP;  LANtrail's TSR module resides in5KB RAM, as opposed to LT Auditor's 20KB for the single-server version.andM;On the other hand, to get its information, LANtrail works by trappinginformation at each audited workstation and continuously sending thosedetails to the server.andP;  On a large network, that traffic could cause somesystem degradation.andP;  LT Auditor sends to the server only the information thatsatisfies each user's filter.andP;  So you might want to consider whether serverdisk space or network traffic is more crucial to your LAN's performance.andM;LANtrail monitors actual changes made to the bindery, while LT Auditor alonedoes not.andP;  LT Auditor will record SYSCON logins and logouts.andP;  However, to seechanges made to the bindery, you need to run Blue Lance's LT Stat+.andM;Netlog from Network Enhancement Tools or NETinc (Houston) creates an audittrail of user activity for Novell networks.andP;  The main difference between itand LT Auditor or LANtrail is that you can specify any sort of activity to bemonitored.andP;  NetLog offers a scaled-down alternative to audit programs.andM;NetLog obtains the date, time, user, station, and node address directly fromthe operating system, takes up to three additional user-defined, fixed-lengthparameters, and outputs all eight fields as one record to a user-specifiedtext file.andM;The three user-defined fields--two 15-character strings and one 40-characterstring--act as parameters to a NetLog function call.andP;  You can compose thecontent of these fields in a menu interface, a batch file, or any applicationexecuting an external program.andM;A common use of the program is to call NetLog from within batch files toproduce a log of when applications are entered and exited, the names of theapplications used and who used them.andM;PrepLog, a companion program, sorts the log files by any of the eight fields.andO;Any program that accepts fixed length or ASCII-delimited files can processthe PrepLog data further.andM;The package of NetLog and PrepLog costs $195 per server.andP;  NetLog will executeon non-Novell networks, but the station, user ID, and node address fieldswill be filled with zeros if the network does not provide that information.andO;NETinc's NetMenu software package also includes these programs.andM;Mixed BagandM;NetCompanion, introduced a few months ago by ETI Software and now sold byDariana Technology Group (Buena Park, Calif.) is a collection of 16 utilitiesfor server management, queue monitoring, file management, and more.andM;Getuser and Nconnect are the user management tools.andP;  Getuser enables users torecord bindery information.andP;  Nconnect gives users the ability to enforceuser, station, and server restrictions for application programs.andM;Scontrol, Netstat, and Systat are the server management and security tools.andO;Scontrol allows server control from the command line and from batch files,including disable logins, turn off TTS, shut down server, and clear stations.andO;Netstat gathers and displays bar charts of network performance.andP;  Files inuse, load percentage, connections in use, free disk space, file servicepackets, routed packets, routing buffers, and cache information are among thestatistics reported.andP;  Systat displays server information from the DOS commandline, including utilization, available cache buffers, and hit percentage.andP;  Italso displays routing buffers, open files, bindery objects, connections, andserver memory usage figures.andM;Qstat monitors print quests; Chktime enables users to create time-controlledbatch files; Cursor and Xcls are for creating attractive batch files.andP;  Getkeyand Break also can be used in batch file operations.andP;  Findpath locatesmultiple executable files with the same name across network and local drives.andO;Isdir verifies the existence of network directories.andP;  Wconsole reports theconfiguration of all workstations, bridges, and servers of the LAN, includingIPX/SPX, network shell version, and DOS version.andP;  Vmode and Vtype ensure thatapplications are properly configured for a particular workstation.andM;Fresh Technology Group's (Gilbert, Ariz.) Fresh Utilities for NetWareconsists of 10 command-line utilities.andP;  It retrieves and consolidates datafrom the file server and bindery.andP;  It lists details about user activity onthe network--specifically, open files and print queues present.andP;  The menuinterface provides such details as the company name, revision number, serialnumber, total server memory, wasted server memory, connections, open files,fatal FAT errors, bytes read and written, open and maximum index files, andcaching information.andM;Ftdirsiz tells the size of a directory and its contents, includingsubdirectories.andP;  Ftbind gives bindery object and property information inASCII and hexadecimal notation for objects.andP;  Ftdrives reports to users thedrive letters not currently used by local drive and NetWare mappings.andO;Ftgroups displays an onscreed grid showing the names of all groups on theserver and members of each group.andM;Some of Fresh utilities provide enhancements, rather than report information.andO;Ftcopy lets users copy a file to the server with its DOS and NetWare fileattributes remaining intact.andP;  The company claims this utility is faster thanNCOPY and DOS COPY.andM;Ftmsgrmv watches for Send or Broadcast messages on the workstation andautomatically clears them after a specified number of seconds.andP;  This allowsthe PC to resume processing without interruption.andP;  Ftsend allows users tosend messages from within applications.andP;  Ftlight displays a file server'drive light' on the PC screen to notify users of reads and writes being madeto the server disk.andM;The Fresh utilities work with DOS 2.x or higher on NetWare and othernetworks.andP;  Fresh Technology Group announced a NetBIOS version in June.andP;  Thesoftware costs $179.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
