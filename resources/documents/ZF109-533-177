 But it's not so nice not to getpaid for it.andP;  Many federal employees live from paycheck to paycheck.andP;  Othersof us are fortunate enough to appreciate a few days off, even if unpaid.andM;However, unless the budget negotiators solve some pretty knotty problems,time off without pay is what most federal workers will get.andP;  With furloughfever in the air, many federal employees are considering part-time jobs tomake up for their lost earnings.andM;The laws and regulations governing outside employment are complicated anddiscouraging.andP;  The same rules designed to prevent undue influence ongovernment actions also limit your options for supplementing your income.andO;Moreover, the more specialized your skills, the less likely you'll be able tofind similar part-time work that you can accept legally.andP;  For short-termemployment, pizza delivery may be hard to beat.andM;Nevertheless, outside employment as an ADP professional is possible.andP;  Becauseeach agency has its own rules, the first step is to visit your ethics officeror general counsel's office.andP;  Their job is to explain both the governmentwideand agency-specific policies.andP;  Moreover, your work situation may requireindividual consideration.andP;  In any case, perhaps the best advice I can giveyou is this: Get expert advice.andM;Before you visit these experts, you may want to ask yourself some questions.andO;In your federal job, can you make or recommend decisions that affect yourprospective part-time employer?andM;If the answer is yes, then you have an illegal conflict of interest.andP;  This isparticularly true in Washington because so many companies here do businesswith the federal government.andM;Does your part-time employer do business with your agency?andP;  Is the companyseeking business from your agency?andP;  Is this actual or potential businessrelated to your federal job?andP;  If the answer to this last question is yes,then you may have another conflict of interest.andM;If you pass these conflict-of-interest hurdles, you still can work part-timefor a company that does business with the government.andP;  However, thelimitations can be awkward.andP;  Your ethics officer will have several concernsabout your potential dealings with the government.andM;Ethical QuestionsandM;Criminal law forbids federal employees from profiting from representingothers to the federal government.andP;  Ask yourself, does this part-time jobinvolve representing your employer to the government, even if not paid?andP;  Thisis illegal, except if you are representing a fellow employee in a disciplineor loyalty proceeding.andM;Your ethics officer might approve your employment if you are paid the sameregardless of the amount of government work your part-time employer takes on.andO;Presumably, if your pay doesn't change, you are not profiting from yourextra-curricular contacts with the government.andP;  But if your part-time hoursincreased as a result of a government contract, you could be in trouble.andM;The law on profiting from representation makes it risky to talk to federalemployees about your part-time job.andP;  If you are an employee or subcontractor,you may not represent the company to any government client.andP;  All contactshould be insulated through your part-time employer.andP;  Your part-time employershould not use your name when presenting your work or negotiating changes andcorrections.andM;Can your part-time employer advertise your expertise?andP;  Yes, but with greatcare.andP;  The law forbids the use of public office for private gain.andM;You or your part-time employer may not derive benefit from your federalposition or title.andP;  However, you and your part-time employer can characterizeyour experience in generic terms.andP;  Unless your reputation is well known, thisrule makes it difficult to convey your expertise and references in contractproposals.andM;This point also holds for paid speaking engagements, even for charity.andP;  Yourgovernment title can be used, but only to identify you, not attract buyers orsell tickets.andM;You should be just another speaker.andP;  You must not endorse or appear toendorse a product or service.andP;  Nor should your involvement suggest youragency's endorsement.andM;Most agencies require written permission from your supervisor before you canaccept outside employment.andP;  This permission statement should describe thenature of the job, the employer, the hours, if fixed, and other pertinentdetails.andP;  You should declare that this outside job will not be a conflict ofinterest or give the appearance of same.andM;Of course, you are not allowed to do your part-time job during your federaljob.andP;  In addition to the ethical issues, your outside work must not causetardiness, inattentiveness or other adverse effects on your federal jobperformance.andM;Reading this column is no substitute for good legal advice.andP;  The subject istoo complex to explain in a single column.andP;  Don't act based on what you readhere; see your agency's ethics officer before you make a big mistake.andM;If outside employment seems impossible, take cheer, because it can be done.andO;I've had the part-time job of writing this column for three years.andP;  But ifyou decide it isn't worth the hassle, I can easily understand that decision,too.andP;  In that case, I recommend volunteering to help the homeless or thecharity of your choice.andP;  Or spending a warm Indian summer at the beach.andM;Walter R. Houser is responsible for information resources management andpolicy at a major federal agency.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
