A blend of wastegas, air and fuel was directed through the shell of a heat exchangerfor preheating then caused to flow through the catalyst bed where theoxidation of the combustible components provided the heat required tomaintain the catalyst bed temperature. The oxidation products emergingfrom the combustion chamber were then passed through the heat exchangertubes and, ultimately, discharged. The test program was designed to characterizethe performance of the incinerator at four catalyst bed temperatures.Particular attention was devoted to the precise measurement and controlof all variables required to define the material and energy balancesand, hence, the energy efficiency of the system. The quality of the dataobtained from the pilot plant study was excellent and indicated the following.The oxidation reactions are generally progressive throughout the shelland combustion zone of the incinerator. Predicted heat transfer coefficientsin the heat exchanger deviated widely from those determined experimentally.The formation of SO/sub 3/ was kinetically limited at low catalyst bedtemperatures, but the stack gas concentration was unacceptably high.At temperatures around 900/sup 0/C, the SO/sub 3/ concentration was nearthe equilibrium value, and the stack concentration was at a more acceptablelevel. The catalytic/recuperative incinerator concept appears to offera practical means to limit energy consumption in sulphur plant wastegas incineration. Savings could be in the order of 30% to 100% when comparedto the conventional incinerator configuration. 6 refs., 28 figs., 12tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
