In the leafy hills of West Virginia, the Republicanlawmaker is known as the man who threatened to deprive anentire industry of a tax break when a local utility refusedto wire his cabin for free.</LP><TEXT>   In his own district near Philadelphia, he is famous amonghis critics for introducing legislation to penalizenewspapers that don't use more recycled newsprint. His primetarget, they say, was his nemesis, the Philadelphia Inquirer.   And here in Washington, some oil-industry lobbyists stillquake at the broadside Mr. Schulze unleashed against one ofthem for criticizing a pet tax proposal of his during aprivate meeting.   Congress usually is thought of as a kind of sugar daddydoling out goodies -- such as tax breaks and constructionprojects -- whenever it gets the chance. But legislators canalso act like executioners, punishing or threatening topunish interests that fall into their disfavor.   House ethics rules frown on punitive behavior as a courseof official conduct. Guidelines specifically prohibit the&quot;direct or implied suggestion of either favoritism orreprisal&quot; for actions taken by federal agencies; ethicscommittee staffers tell lawmakers that same advice applies toother interests as well.   But acts of not-so-random retribution do occur. DemocraticRep. James Traficant of Ohio recently delayed House action onan appropriations bill for hours by deleting provision afterprovision relating to the Internal Revenue Service andrelated agencies. Mr. Traficant is fighting a heftyassessment for back taxes levied on him by the IRS for bribeshe allegedly received from organized crime. (He was acquittedon criminal charges in the matter after arguing that heaccepted the bribes as part of his own sting operation.)   In the Senate, no less a personage than Democratic Sen.Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the former majority leader andnow chairman of the Appropriations Committee, pushed into lawstiff new restrictions on lobbying after West VirginiaUniversity paid a Washington lobbying firm to help it get agrant that Sen. Byrd believed he should have championed freeof charge.   Rep. Schulze (pronounced Shulz) says he doesn't fit intothe category of lawmakers who use their official position toget back at people or interests. His actions are justified bythe merits of the issues, he says. He insists there's &quot;noconnection&quot; between his public positions and his personalquarrels.   Among those who disagree with him is Douglas Wine, thegeneral manager of Shenandoah Valley Electric Cooperative,based in Crawford, Va. Mr. Wine insists flatly thatlegislation introduced by the congressman this year is &quot;aimedat uswithout a doubt.&quot;   Rep. Schulze's cabin is in a remote, mountainous area nearMathias, W.Va., and is served by the Shenandoah Valleycooperative. The congressman applied for electric-powerservice for the lodge in 1988, Mr. Wine says, and the co-op'sengineering staff figured it would take 4,200 feet of line --through wooded, mountainous terrain -- to reach his place.Line-construction costs range from $15,000 to $18,000 a milein the mountains, he says.   At the time, it was the co-op's policy to hook uppermanent, year-round homes for free. But for owners ofseasonal homes, such as Mr. Schulze's, the policy was to billin advance for construction costs above $1,850. The co-opwanted Mr. Schulze to pay about $7,000, an amount Mr. Schulzesays he couldn't afford and, in any event, was &quot;outrageous.&quot;   Rep. Schulze says he telephoned the rural co-ops' lobbyinggroup in Washington, but that his calls went unreturned. &quot;Wehad calls from his office. . . . He seemed to want specialconcessions in terms of not requiring him to pay the up-frontcosts,&quot; says W.R. &quot;Dick&quot; Fleming, the co-op's executive vicepresident. &quot;They're always a few {people} who want somethingspecial. He's one, very definitely.&quot;   Ultimately, the congressman paid less than the originalassessment because somebody built a permanent home betweenhis lodge and the closest power line. He now has electricservice. But earlier this year, he introduced legislationthat would deny the tax-exempt status for rural electriccooperatives with gross receipts of more than $25 million.The Shenandoah Valley co-op reported revenue of $26.5 millionfor 1989 and $28.7 million for 1990, Mr. Wine says.   Rep. Schulze says his rural electric bill &quot;has nothing todo&quot; with his run-in with the co-op. He argues that theexemption these days too often benefits utilities that servesuburbs rather than the hard-to-reach rural areas originallyintended under the law. In addition, he says, repealing theexemption would help the Ways and Means Committee, on whichhe serves, find a new source of revenue for the government.   Mr. Schulze's problems with the Philadelphia Inquirer stemfrom news stories the paper published about trips he tookthat were paid for by special-interest groups, and somespecial-interest legislation he pushed. Last year, theInquirer also endorsed his opponent in a strongly wordededitorial.   Late in 1989, Mr. Schulze introduced legislation thatwould among other things impose tough tax penalties onnewspapers that fail to use a minimum amount of recyclednewsprint. At a news conference last fall to push thelegislation, he charged a dozen newspapers across the nationwith failing to do enough in recycling. On that list was thePhiladelphia Inquirer. (Also on the list was The Wall StreetJournal.)   Mr. Schulze's interest in recycling surprised localenvironmentalists, who generally don't consider him one oftheir own. (His rating by the League of Conservation Voterswas 38% last year and 20% in 1989.) &quot;The only conclusion thatany of us could draw was, `Boy, was he mad at thePhiladelphia Inquirer, and what a way to get back at them,'&quot;says Sara Nichols, staff attorney for the Clean Air Councilof the Delaware Valley.   &quot;I'm sure the congressman's motives are his own,&quot; saysCharles Fancher, spokesman for the Inquirer, which is ownedby Knight-Ridder Inc. &quot;None of us here would begin to ascribeany reasons for a representative's legislative actions.&quot;   Rep. Schulze angrily denies that he advocates newsprintrecycling for any reason other than to improve theenvironment, and says the Inquirer &quot;is not an extremely heavyfactor in my district.&quot;   Rep. Schulze's pet project this year is promoting a majorrevision of the corporate income tax into a kind ofvalue-added tax. He has lobbied hard to get the endorsementof business groups, but was furious when he heard that someoil-industry representatives had expressed doubts about theplan.   In a March 12 letter to William Rountree, vice president,federal-government affairs, of British Petroleum Co.'s BPAmerica unit, he wrote: &quot;I am greatly disturbed that as aconstituent company located in my 5th congressional district,the only time I hear from BP is when you need immediateassistance or when you are launching scathing attacks on myproposals without first consulting with me.&quot; He found thesituation &quot;particularly disconcerting,&quot; he added, &quot;in view ofmy support on key issues of importance to your company.&quot;   Industry lobbyists say the letter sent tremors throughtheir community, triggering nervous discussions about how torespond. A week later, Mr. Rountree wrote back contritely:&quot;We applaud your efforts to introduce new and novel taxingconcepts into the overall tax debate and look forward toworking with you to perfect these concepts.&quot;   Mr. Rountree didn't return phone calls asking about theincident. As for Rep. Schulze, he says he wasn't at allthreatening BP. &quot;I'm not trying to get anybody,&quot; he says.&quot;What I don't want is mindless criticism.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
