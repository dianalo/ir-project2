About 42percent of the professors are dues-paying members, according to one unionofficial.;    The resignations, which began in December and have increased inrecent days, are the latest visible sign of the faculty's deep concern aboutthe Balgooyen case, particularly within the biology department.;    &quot;There aresome that would have resigned if we did not represent him,&quot; said ManuelFimbres, president of the union's university chapter. &quot;We were damned if wedid, damned if we didn't.&quot;;    A federal court jury in June found Balgooyenguilty of conspiring with one of his former students to collect a protectedOregon slender salamander during a 1986 trip, and of capturing twice as manysalamanders as his federal permit allowed. In November, he was sentenced tofive years' probation, fined $5,000 and ordered to perform 2,000 hours ofcommunity service.;    In a separate trial, a federal jury in July found himnot guilty on one felony count of evading income taxes, and could not reach averdict on a second count. Balgooyen has taught at SJS since 1974 and is atenured professor, a measure of job protection which is meant to promoteacademic freedom and prevent dismissal except in cases of misconduct.;    Theuniversity believes Balgooyen's convictions constitute grounds for dismissal,and attempted to fire him as of Jan. 1. Balgooyen decided to fight, and hassought an appeal through an arbitration process with the union. The union andthe university have yet to settle on an arbitrator.;    In December, the unionagreed to represent Balgooyen -- in part because it could face a lawsuit if itchose not to, Fimbres said. He added: &quot;What's a union for if we're onlyfair-weather friends?&quot;;    Fimbres said the resigning professors were all&quot;very bright people. I do not like it, but I respect the decision they havemade.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  TOM PHILP, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910216  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  437  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday February 16, 199100047153,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
