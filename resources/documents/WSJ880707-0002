In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.8205 marks, little changed from 1.8208 marks late Tuesday. It was quoted at 133.35 yen, down from 134.31 yen.    In mid-morning dealings in Tokyo on Thursday, the U.S. currency was trading at about 132.35 yen, down from 132.98 yen at the opening.    A widespread lack of conviction on the outlook for the U.S. currency has replaced the unbridled bullishness of the past three weeks. Traders said the dollar's inability to maintain important technical levels, the fear that central banks' tolerance of a higher dollar may have been exhausted, and the approaching July 15 release of U.S. trade data for May have combined to rein in demand for dollars.    The West German Bundesbank sold $133.1 million at the Frankfurt foreign-exchange fixing, the largest public intervention since the central bank resumed interventions against the dollar May 31. The Bundesbank also was reported by traders to be selling dollars on the open market, the eighth day it has intervened out of the past nine sessions.    Jeff Mondschein, vice president at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Group, said the Bundesbank's repeated interventions are affecting market sentiment. &quot;The Bundesbank is having a little impact,&quot; he said. &quot;Intervention is most effective when (the market's) running out of steam.&quot;    Most traders dismissed a report that Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita would express concern at this week's meeting of the Bank for International Settlements that the dollar had risen too high. But the perception that the Japanese central bank doesn't want the dollar to rise further helped push the dollar down against the yen, traders said.    Traders said the dollar appears to be settling into narrow ranges until tomorrow's U.S. employment data or next week's trade figures provide some impetus for it to resume its rally or give back some of its recent gains.    On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $436.80 an ounce, up 50 cents. Estimated volume was a light 2.1 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $439.75 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                 Late New York Trading                 Wednesday, July 6, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
