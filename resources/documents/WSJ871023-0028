Interest rates are a lot lower. And the economy is likely to grow a lot more slowly than people expected.    So some analysts and money managers are trying to scratch together a buy list for this new environment. They now favor stocks helped by lower rates, such as insurance companies, and companies hurt least by an economic downturn, such as electric utilities, drug and food and beverage companies.    &quot;With the economy a source of great uncertainty, you go to industries which have the least uncertainty of unit growth and cash flow,&quot; says Mike Holland, president of First Boston Asset Management. Others say high-dividend stocks, which often rally along with bonds when interest rates fall, should also do better.    Eric Miller, chief investment officer of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette, yesterday recommended defensive and interest-sensitive stocks, particularly Southern California Edison and Southwestern Bell. Mr. Miller favors financial, housing, utility, health care, food and beverage companies.    The idea here is that in hard times, consumers can put off purchases of houses, cars and appliances before they can cut back on such essentials as food, beverages, drugs and health care, electricity and phones.    So far at least, those stocks have already emerged as the best performers during the market slide. Strategist Marshall Acuff of Smith Barney, Harris Upham has analyzed the five trading days ending Wednesday, when the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock index fell 15%. The 10 best groups and their percentage declines were: electric utilities (5.4%), brewers (7.5%), Bell operating companies (7.6%), international oils (8.2%), soft drinks (8.4%), restaurants (10%), soaps (11%), diversified health care (12%), multi-line insurance (13%), and foods (13%).    Some of these groups, particularly utilities, had been among the worst performers during the most recent leg of the bull market, from August 1986 to August 1987. That phase had favored cyclical companies, particularly exporters and those facing import competition, because their earnings would get a big boost from the falling dollar.    Some money managers are skeptical, believing the idea of playing defensive stocks in a slowdown is too obvious. &quot;All the Wall Street firms or strategists that have called here have had that message,&quot; says Bruce Calvert, research director at Alliance Capital Management.    &quot;That's a natural reaction. But I'm not sure it will look right for more than a month, particularly if the market can hold its current level,&quot; said Mr. Calvert. He noted that shocks to consumer demand in 1962 and 1980 proved relatively short-lived. But he added all bets are off if the market breaks down again.    One reason faster growth may kick in again soon, of course, is that the Fed has been pumping money into the system to reduce interest rates. Mr. Miller frankly refers to his picks as &quot;some of the former disinflation favorites.&quot; But turning on the money tap, known in some quarters as &quot;reflating,&quot; could turn out to be highly inflationary in the longer term.    PaineWebber strategist Edward Kerschner counters that by his valuation methods, consumer nondurables, utilities and financial stocks were priced 40% to 50% below economically sensitive stocks before the market slump. Since then, he contends, only one-fourth of that difference has been erased, and that's without counting the foggier economic outlook.    He still believes in such defensive issues as Sara Lee, Pacific Telesis, J.P. Morgan, McDonald's Corp., and Ralston Purina. He also likes such insurers as Aetna Life andamp; Casualty and Travelers Corp. and other banks like Security Pacific and Bankers Trust. Financial companies, which tend to hold notes and bonds, generally are helped by lower interest rates.    It would take real bravery to recommend brokerage stocks before this week's losses are tallied, and Mr. Kerschner isn't quite ready for that yet. But he believes well run, well capitalized financial firms such as American Express should gain from any shakeout among marginal competitors.    Money manager David Dreman of Dreman Value Management says he has been buying some defensive stocks in the drug and hospital sectors this week, such as Smithkline Beckman and Pfizer Inc. He also has 10% of his money in insurance stocks. Both groups have been &quot;terrible&quot; performers this year, he says.    Mr. Holland of First Boston said he held so many utilities and financial service stocks that &quot;we were sucking wind for part of this bull market&quot; this past year. But since September, he says, they have helped him outperform the market average by four percentage points.    Mr. Dreman agrees with Mr. Kerschner that cyclicals, the darlings of the market cycle that seems to have just ended, have further to fall. &quot;They were really overdone,&quot; he says. They have already been hit hard in the five trading days ended Wednesday, according to Mr. Acuff of Smith Barney. The worst performing groups and their percentage declines in that period were:    Miscellaneous metals (32%), semiconductors (31%), paper and container stocks (31%), aluminum (30%), leisure (30%), tires and rubber (27%), steel (27%), department stores (26%), gold (25%), and homebuilders (25%).    Mr. Acuff shifted his own focus away from cyclicals in early October, but doesn't know yet whether it's time to switch back into defensive stocks. He explained, &quot;A lot of things are still in a state of flux. I'm not sure I want to be a hero and focus absolutely on any one area.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
