Philip Casnoff suffered minor injuries Tuesday night, said SamRudy, a spokesman for the show.   ``He's going to be all right,'' Rudy said.   Rudy said the Wednesday matinee and evening performances werecanceled, but preview performances will resume Thursday. Theofficial opening, originally set for Nov. 15, was pushed back toTuesday.   The audience at the Marquis Theater screamed when the screenfell to the stage, grazing Casnoff on his head, Rudy said. No oneelse, on or off-stage, was injured.   The performance was a benefit for Montefiore Medical Center inThe Bronx.   A doctor in the audience scrambled to the stage and examinedCasnoff, Rudy added.   ``The show was so exciting and the special effects sounbelievable that when I saw something coming from above, I thoughtit was part of the show,'' said Dr. Berish Strauch, who was sittingin the 10th row.   ``It struck the leading man, Mr. Casnoff, and he dropped to theground and just lay there,'' said Strauch, head of the departmentof plastic and reconstructive surgery at Montefiore Hospital andthe Albert Einstein College of Medicine. ``I realized quickly thathe was hurt and that this was not part of the show, so I ran to thestage.''   The doctor said Casnoff probably was unconscious for about 15-20seconds but when he examined him, the actor was able to move hisarms and legs. Casnoff was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital where hewas treated for bruises and then released. He suffered minorinjuries to the face and neck.   Casnoff was the lavish musical's second leading man. PeterKarrie, the original star, was fired during the musical'sWashington tryout. In ``Shogun,'' Casnoff plays a 17th centuryEnglish sailor shipwrecked in Japan. The musical is based on JamesClavell's epic novel that became a successful television miniseriesstarring Richard Chamberlain. The book and lyrics for ``Shogun''were written by John Driver and the music is by Paul Chihara.</TEXT></DOC>
