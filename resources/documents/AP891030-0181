Representatives from the Pentagon, State Department, CommerceDepartment and Arms Control and Disarmament Agency were unanimousin opposing the proposed sanctions legislation at a House ForeignAffairs Committee hearing, despite prospects that the number ofcountries with such technology will double within a decade.   Richard Clarke, assistant secretary of state forpolitico-military affairs, said the United States is seeking tocurb the spread of missile technology through the two-year-oldMissile Technology Control Regime. The agreement, which now hasseven member nations, is likely to grow to include more countriesafter a meeting set for the first week in December, Clarke said.   Mandating sanctions would ``threaten the regime'seffectiveness'' because it would inhibit exchanges of informationbetween signatory countries, said Clarke. ``The sanctions arealmost certain to have a chilling effect.''   The sponsor of the legislation, Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif.,said he was not persuaded by the testimony. ``In the end, a regimethat has no penalties will not be as successful,'' he said. ``Therewill be companies and countries that will see the lure of economicbenefit as overriding'' proliferation concerns. ``You have to hitthem in their economies.''   Conspicuously absent from the Monday's hearing was any detaileddiscussion of recent revelations that Israel has been aiding SouthAfrica in developing its own intermediate-range missile.   Answering questions from reporters after the hearing, Clarkeacknowledged that the United States had learned throughintelligence channels in January of the Israel-South Africacooperation, and objected to Israeli officials at that time. ``Weare still having a dipolomatic dialogue'' with Israel on thesubject, he said.   Berman's bill would bar companies from doing business with theU.S. government or from receiving advanced technology whichrequires a U.S. export license if they are found to be violatingthe non-proliferation regime.   Clarke acknowledged that the legislation could have thepotential for cutting U.S. aid to Israel, which has tremendouspolitical sensitivity, if there were continued transfers.   ``If there were a government or corporate relationship withSouth Africa, that might mandate that we terminate a variety ofprograms with Israel,'' he said.   Henry Sokolski, an international security official at thePentagon, said the Defense Department is ``seriously considering''making compliance with export controls a condition of doingbusiness with the government for suppliers involved in the missiletechnology. A decision in the department's upper echelons isexpected soon, he said.   The transfer of missile technology has become an increasingconcern in the past three years, particularly in light of itspotential for providing destabilizing delivery mechanisms forchemical and nuclear weapons.   The control regime now includes seven countries: the UnitedStates, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Great Britain. Itseeks to control export of technology for missiles carryingpayloads of more than 1,100 pounds more than 190 miles. The SovietUnion, China, Iran, Israel, North Korea and South Korea are amongother nations that have ballistic missile technology.</TEXT></DOC>
