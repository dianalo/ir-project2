The machines, as previously reported, easily outdistancethose on the market from International Business MachinesCorp., Fujitsu Ltd. and Amdahl Corp., which is 46%-owned byFujitsu and sells machines that Fujitsu designs. Consultantssaid that the Hitachi machine with three central processorscan operate at 124 million instructions per second, and thatthe four-processor machine runs at 150 mips. By contrast,IBM's most powerful machine runs at 112 mips, and the fastestFujitsu/Amdahl mainframe runs at 108 mips.</LP><TEXT>   The machines coming from IBM and Fujitsu/Amdahl areexpected to be roughly comparable to the Hitachi hardware.Still, Hitachi, which has been the laggard at the high end ofthe mainframe market, is finally expected to become a playerthere.   Hitachi said shipments will begin in the third quarter.Its 80%-owned U.S. arm, Hitachi Data Systems, said it willbegin shipments in the 1991 second quarter. That, again, putsit roughly on a par with IBM and Fujitsu/Amdahl, which areexpected to begin U.S. shipments between the 1991 secondquarter and the end of the year.   Hitachi Data said a typical three-processor system will bepriced at $11.8 million, and a typical four-processor systemat $14.4 million. Consultants said these prices are about 10%to 15% less than IBM charges for each unit of computingpower, the normal discount needed to compete with IBM.</TEXT></DOC>
