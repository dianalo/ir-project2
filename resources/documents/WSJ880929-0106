The bill, which already passed the House, also would shift to manufacturers from the EPA some of the costs associated with banning and disposing of pesticides the agency deems dangerous.    The bill is a slimmer, less controversial version of legislation approved earlier by the Senate that also would have limited ground-water contamination by pesticides, imposed health regulations for farm workers, and more closely monitored pesticide levels in foods. But that version, opposed by the chemical industry, had little hope of being enacted before Congress' scheduled adjournment in mid-October.    The approved bill deals with pesticides that were registered for use before passage of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act of 1972. The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said that at its current rate of testing, the EPA would need another 35 years to evaluate all the substances.    Many environmentalists were pleased that the bill passed in some form, but nonetheless derided the final version as &quot;FIFRA Lite.&quot;    &quot;From the industry point of view, it tastes great, and is less regulating,&quot; said Rick Hind, of the Public Interest Research Group in Washington, who supported the stiffer bill. </TEXT></DOC>
