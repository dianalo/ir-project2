Albacore vesselsusing trolling gear fishing outside of the 200 nautical mile fisherieszones of the Pacific Island Parties are excluded from the Treaty's licensingrequirements. U.S. tuna purse seine vessels which have had difficultiesat times fishing in this area because of unresolved jurisdictional fishingclaims over tuna will now be able to obtain licenses under an establishedfee schedule and have access to much of the area.As a foreign affairs function implementing an international fisheries agreementwhich is now in effect, these regulations are not required to be publishedas proposed regulations. However, these regulations are being publishedas interim final regulations to provide a 30 day public comment period.Although the Treaty and the Act have dictated the specific content of virtuallyall of the provisions of the regulations, some changes may be possiblein response to comments received.

Fullerton (Director, SouthwestRegion, NMFS), (213) 514-6196.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>Supplementary Information:</T2> On April 2, 1987, after more than twoyears of negotiations, the United States signed a treaty with 12 Pacificisland nations (Australia, Cook Islands, Federated State of Micronesia,Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea,Solomon Islands, Tuvbalu, and Western Samoa). The nations of Niue, Palau,and Vanuatu became signatories at a later date. Ten million square milesof South Pacific Ocean are encompassed by the Treaty area. On June 7, 1988,the President signed the implementing legislation into law as the SouthPacific Tuna Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-330). The Treaty went into effecton June 15, 1988.In the South Pacific Ocean, fisheries disputes between the United Statesand several Pacific island nations had resulted from conflicting juridicalpositions with respect to tuna. U.S. tuna purse seine vessels had beenseized by island nations, causing retaliatory U.S. trade embargoes as mandatedby the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The Treaty isa result of the efforts of the United States and Pacific island nationsto resolve these problems.The regulations set forth specifics of the implementation of the Treatyand the Act by the United States. The National Marine Fisheries Service,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce,is responsible for most of the day-to-day operational aspects of the Treatyobligations of the United States. The Department of State, in additionto having a consultative or concurrence role on many aspects of the regulations,is responsible for the formal country-to-country contacts under the Treaty.Certain obligations of the United States Government to the Pacific IslandParties relating to alleged infringements of the Treaty are not set forthin the regulations, nor are certain procedures established by the Act inregard to rulemaking authority and interagency operations. These mattersare not obligations placed upon the public and were therefore not includedin the regulations.Licenses are required by all U.S. flag tuna fishing vessels to fish inthe Treaty Area, except for albacore tuna fishing vessels using the trollingmethod outside of the 200 nautical mile fisheries zones of the PacificIsland Parties. Annual Licenses may be obtained from the Treaty Administrator,the Forum Fisheries Agency (``FFA''), by U.S. tuna purse seine vesselsby completing an application form and providing it and some additionalinsurance, agent, and financial information along with the license feesrequired to the Southwest Regional Director, NMFS. The regulations setforth the criteria which the Commerce Department, in consultation withthe Secretary of State, will use to determine whether a license applicationcan be forwarded to the FFA for processing. License fees for the firstyear, which started on June 15, 1988, are a minimum of $50,000 a vesselfor the first 40 licenses (fees for at least 35 licenses must be paid inthe first licensing period). Licenses for 10 additional vessels are availablefor the first licensing period for $60,000 each. Fees for subsequent yearsare indexed to the price of tuna fish, with a minimum fee of $50,000. Thelicensing period is the same for all vessels, without any staggered periodsor prorated fees.Other requirements established by the Treaty and the Act which are addressedin the regulations cover (1) definitions; (2) compliance with certain lawsof the Pacific island nations; (3) reporting requirements for vessels entering,within, and leaving the licensing area, and on fish caught and landed;(4) data confidentiality measures; (5) vessel and gear marking; (6) closedarea fishing gear stowage measures; (7) radio monitoring frequencies; (8)prohibited acts; (9) civil penalty procedures; (10) vessel operators' rightsto provide information bearing on an investigation of an alleged violation;(11) a ``findings'' procedure allowing the Secretary to order a vesselto leave various portions of the Treaty area under certain circumstances;(12) procedures on taking and treating observers and providing access aboardship; and (13) inspection obligations.Although these regulations reflect in very large part provisions specificallyrequired by the Treaty and the Act, the Secretary does solicit commentson these interim final regulations and will consider them to the extentdiscretion exists to modify the regulations consistent with the Treatyand the Act. In this regard, comments are particularly encouraged on thefollowing topics: (1) The specific license application procedures set forthin andSection; 282.2; (2) the provisions defining and prescribing the dutiesof authorized inspectors set forth in andSection;andSection; 282.2, 282.9,and 282.15; the cross-referencing in andSection; 282.11 to the Agency's existingcivil penalty procedures regulations; and the cross-referencing in andSection;282.4 to ``applicable national laws.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, (Assistant Administrator)has determined that this rule will not have a significant impact on thehuman environment. NMFS has prepared an environmental assessment (EA) onthe rule. The finding of the EA was that no significant impact on the humanenvironment will occur as a result of this rule and that no environmentalimpact statement was required. The EA is available upon request (see ADDRESS).This action is exempt from the provisions of Executive Order 12291 undersection (2)(a)(1) because these regulations are issued with respect toa foreign affairs function of the United States.The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to theSmall Business Administration that the rule is exempt from the RegulatoryFlexibility Act and the preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysisbecause it involves a foreign affairs function of the United States andnotice and comment rulemaking is not required.This action is not subject to section 553 of the Administrative ProcedureAct because the implementation of this rule is a foreign affairs function.However, the Assistant Administrator will solicit public comments on therule and will consider them to the extent discretion exists to modify theregulations consistent with the Treaty and the Act.This rule includes a collection-of-information requirement subject to thePaperwork Reduction Act; effectiveness of the requirement is deferred untilafter approval by the Office of Management and Budget. A request to collectthis information has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budgetfor approval. Public reporting burden for this collection of informationis estimated to average 0.73 hours per response, including the time forreviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering andmaintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any otheraspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducingthis burden, to the Regional Director and to OMB (see <T2>ADDRESSES</T2>).The rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.This rule does not directly affect the coastal zone of any state with anapproved coastal zone management program.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 282 </ITAG>Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, South Pacific Treaty.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 23, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
