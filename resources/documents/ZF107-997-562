 Here's an interim report on how thisfundamental change may affect you.andP;  (For even more on the subject, see &quot;FinePrint,&quot; September '89, and &quot;Hot Type: Rising Font Wars&quot; in StartUp News,December '89.)andM;PROMISES, PROMISESandM;Apple has already teased and worried us aplenty with advance word on some ofthe other goodies that System 7 will supposedly include--the performanceboost offered by virtual memory, for example.andM;But none of Apple's well-planned leaks about System 7's glories drew as muchinterest--and caused as much concern--among Mac owners as did Apple's Mayannouncement that it would be building new type-management tools into theoperating system.andP;  Not everyone needs or would benefit greatly from suchadditions as virtual memory, but anyone who uses a Mac will benefit from thekind of type tools Apple is talking about adding to System 7.andM;If Apple gets it right, that is.andP;  And if, in the process, it doesn't createproblems for the many Mac owners who have assembled collections of type fontsfrom Adobe, Bitstream, AGFA Compugraphic, Mergenthaler, Casady andamp; Greene,T/Maker, and many other suppliers.andM;Simply put, Apple has promised that System 7 will replace the relativelycrude type-display tools of QuickDraw, heretofore the heart of Mac displaymanagement, with outline fonts built in to the operating system.andP;  That shouldgive Mac owners far better looking text on-screen and maximum-resolutionoutput on any supported printer.andM;Outline fonts are the basis, for example, of Adobe's PostScript system.andO;Rather than storing type fonts in the computer (or printer) as bit maps andthen scaling their component dots up and down as you use larger and smallersizes (or making them fatter or thinner if you choose boldface or lightfaceoptions), outline fonts store a single mathematically described characteroutline and then enlarge, reduce, or otherwise manipulate it to meet yourspecifications.andP;  In the last step, the outline is filled in to form thefinished character on-screen or on paper.andM;Because good-looking output in the Mac universe means LaserWriter output orbetter, the LaserWriter's PostScript imaging system has been the focus ofvirtually all work with high-quality type on the Mac.andP;  PostScript is a highlyportable standard by design, so Mac users can also run off their finishedwork on PostScript-controlled typesetters (often called imagesetters), suchas the popular Linotronic 100 and 300.andM;QUICKDRAWBACKSandM;But several problems are associated with relying on PostScript outputdevices.andP;  The most important arises from differences in the way PostScriptdraws characters for the printer and the way the Mac's QuickDraw routinesdraw those characters on the screen.andM;Anyone who's seen 37-point Helvetica or 78-point Times on a Mac screen knowswhat I mean: They look like hell.andP;  QuickDraw looks at the bit maps availablein your System Folder and tries to find one in exactly the size you'vespecified.andP;  If it does, it draws that on-screen with good results.andP;  (That'swhy Mac owners are always urged to install as many bit-map, or screen-font,sizes as are available.)andM;If QuickDraw doesn't find a screen font in the right size, it extrapolatesfrom the bit maps it does find and invariably throws onto the screen crude,jagged characters.andP;  It's possible to create custom-sized bit maps wherenecessary, with U.S.andP;  MicroLabs' utility program FontSizer II (featured inlast month's column and reviewed in the April '89 issue), but that's a slow,roundabout way to fix a problem that Apple built into the Mac.andM;The second major problem with this odd-couple pairing of two very differentimaging models is that, as novice desktop publishers soon discover, line andpage breaks seen on-screen (with QuickDraw imaging) frequently do not matchthose you see on paper (with PostScript imaging).andM;We've seen several answers to this dilemma over the past year, but untilApple announced its intention to add outline fonts to the operating system,there was no clear movement toward one or another of the answers.andM;Adobe, for example, developed Display PostScript, which uses a single set offont outlines to draw characters on-screen and on paper, thus providing boththe high-quality displays and printouts we need and an exact correspondencebetween screen and paper images.andM;Unfortunately for us all, Apple declined to adopt Display PostScript.andP;  Mostof Apple's worries were about performance--it takes a lot of computing powerto scale and draw those precise characters on-screen--but many also thoughtthe rejection of Display PostScript was tied to a distinct cooling of ardorbetween Adobe and its former investor Apple.andP;  In any case, so far only SteveJobs' NeXT has formally adopted Display PostScript for its machine, althoughIBM has licensed the technology and may use it in the future.andM;Last fall Adobe introduced a second, very good but less comprehensive answerfor Mac users in the form of ATM (Adobe Type Manager).andP;  This INIT sits inmemory, watching for QuickDraw calls to render characters on-screen.andP;  If acall is for a character in a genuine Adobe Type I PostScript font -- whetherit's a font built in to a LaserWriter or available in the System file -- itinterrupts that call, looks at the outline of the character you've installedin your System Folder, and draws a superb-looking character on-screen.andP;  Ifthe call is for any other kind of font, it simply steps back and letsQuickDraw handle the display as usual.andM;Although ATM is a first-rate, low-cost add-on and its display quality anddisplay-to-printed-image correspondence are very high, it falls short of thecomprehensive, single-imaging-model results of Display PostScript.andM;ENTER SYSTEM 7andM;Apple says we'll find in System 7 a complete outline-font technology, builtright in to the operating system -- where, in the best of all worlds, itought to be found.andM;Apple says the technology, code-named Royal, will handle the rendering of allfonts from whatever source (as long as they use Royal technology) and give usgreat results on-screen.andP;  Apple will use the Royal technology in a new lineof printers and also will license the technology to firms that want to buildcompatible printers.andM;If all this sounds as though Apple has decided to abandon thePostScript-based approach that has made it so successful in thehigh-quality-output business -- well, you're not far off.andP;  Soon, Apple hasdecided, its printers won't need expensive PostScript-interpreter licensesanymore because the company is setting its own standard.andM;That's a pretty drastic step, but the real issue is not what will happen toApple -- having taken on this burden of change, the company will eithersuffer the costs or reap the rewards.andP;  The real question is, What's going tohappen to loyal Macintosh users who have $ 15,000 worth of Macintosh andLaserWriter equipment and who, very possibly, have anything from a fewhundred to a few thousand dollars' worth of PostScript fonts sitting on theshelf next to their desk?andP;  Is all that stuff obsolete?andM;Not at all, Apple assures us.andP;  System 7 will support the fonts we alreadyhave (including Royal fonts); our existing output devices (LaserWriters,Linotronic imagesetters, and the like); and, of course, our existingMacintosh computers themselves.andP;  If, that is, we upgrade to System 7.andM;Which, I believe, is far from certain.andM;ROYAL RESERVATIONSandM;If you thought people were hesitant about moving up to new System releases inthe past, you ain't seen nothin' yet.andP;  I'm convinced that because of the morepowerful hardware platforms required to exploit System 7, the inevitable bugsand bombs in every new release, and the uncertainty of the new fonttechnology, widespread adoption of System 7 among Mac users may take a while.andM;That's nothing new, longtime Macintosh users may say with some justification-- we've always worried about each new System release.andP;  Even after we got800K floppy disks, we worried about how much room the System files took.andP;  Weworked out strategies for paring down the size of the System file (seeMichael Swaine's &quot;Slimming the System,&quot; December '89).andM;Even as hard-disk drives became commonplace, we looked with jaundiced eyes atnew system-software releases, wary of the swarms of bugs that had jumped outof the box and stung us with previous new releases.andM;And, of course, we kvetched about Apple's zany release-numbering practice forSystem and Finder pairings -- a jumble that got so bad, you may recall, thatApple started including hilariously cross-tabbed compatibility charts in theback pages of each new System manual.andM;But all that stuff is peanuts compared with what we're gonna be saying aboutSystem 7.andM;Listen: I like the idea of System 7.andP;  Virtual memory is swell.andP;  Havingoutline fonts in the operating system is an elegant idea.andP;  And I may scream,but I'll upgrade the box or stick in a new chip to get those benefits, ifthey're really worth it -- and if they really work.andM;But I'm very wary of this forthcoming first release of System 7.andP;  The Royalfont-management technology has a lot to prove, I think, before we jump in.andO;Sure, Display PostScript eats up computing power -- but so will Royal.andP;  Sure,it's nice to promise compatibility with everything under the sun, but it'sgoing to be very hard to deliver.andM;Does that mean I think System 7 and the Royal font technology may fail?andP;  Ofcourse not.andP;  We'll come around -- sooner or later.andP;  And last September, Applebought itself a nice insurance policy for the Royal font-management code'ssuccess.andP;  At the Seybold electronic-publishing conference, Apple andMicrosoft announced a cross-licensing arrangement whereby Microsoft wouldbuild that same technology into a future release of its OS/2 PresentationManager operating system for IBM PCs and compatibles.andM;That gives printer manufacturers leery of investing in the development ofRoyal-compatible printers a warm feeling; now they won't be gambling so muchon the success of Apple's new gambit.andP;  Whatever you think of IBM PCs -- or ofthe probable adoption rate of the slow-building OS/2 market -- thatannouncement increases severalfold the potential market for Royal-capableoutput devices.andM;Of course, it was also very bad news for Adobe and at least moderately badnews for those who want to see PostScript continue to grow as the imagingmodel in the computer world.andP;  Although the survival of PostScript itselfdoesn't seem doubtful -- too many PostScript-based devices and softwarepackages are out there now for PostScript to disappear -- this move willalmost certainly diminish its future importance.andM;It also introduces a large element of chaos into buying plans.andP;  Buying at theright point in a given technology's life cycle is a big thing for corporatemanagers who have to look three to five years into the future, buyingequipment that will remain current if not quite on the cutting edgethroughout its useful life (and throughout the Internal Revenue Service'sthree-to-five-year depreciation cycle on business equipment).andM;Ahh, Apple.andP;  System 7 is so enticing.andP;  But at what cost?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
