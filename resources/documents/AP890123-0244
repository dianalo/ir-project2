For car dealer Dick Hattingh, independence promises new businessprospects. For rugby coach Henning Snyman, it means a chance for histeam to play overseas. For the Rev. Cobus de Klerk, it offers hisfellow Afrikaners an opportunity to shed their label as ``the damnedapartheid people.''   Elections are set for Nov. 1 to select an assembly to draw up aconstitution for Namibia. It also will set a date for actualindependence; the strong concensus is it will come before year's end.   South Africa has said it will cede its authority in Namibia assoon as the constituent assembly convenes. It agreed to Namibia'sindependence after Cuba signed an accord providing for thewithdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola to the immediate north.   Whites make up only about 75,000 of Namibia's 1.3 million people,but during 74 years of South African rule they have played adominant role in politics and business in what was known asSouth-West Africa.   Even the South-West African People's Organization, which haswaged a guerrilla war for independence since 1966, is urging whitesto stay and contribute to building a new, sovereign country.   ``These whites are Namibians,'' said Jerry Ekandjo, a spokesmanfor SWAPO's legal political wing. ``We have not been fightingagainst them.''   Few whites support SWAPO, and most are expected to back moreconservative parties in the independence elections, which are totake place under United Nations supervision. But the plans to stayare being made with the assumption that SWAPO, at minimum, will wina major role in the new government.   ``My biggest enemy at the moment is not SWAPO,'' said Snyman,head of a farmers' association and coach of the territory's toprugby team. ``It's people who are negative about the comingindependence.''   In recent weeks, more than 100 white transport workers and theirfamilies have left for South Africa. The outward flow is expected toswell if SWAPO takes power, with estimates ranging between 10 to 25percent of the white population.   ``Many people are praying that Resolution 435 (the U.N.independence plan) will go down the drain,'' said de Klerk, leaderof the Dutch Reformed Church, to which most of Namibia's 47,000Afrikaners belong.   ``One fears a change. It's human nature that you prefer it theway it is, especially when you're in a favorable position.''   About 30,000 whites left Namibia amid independence rumors in thelate 1970s. De Klerk predicted a similar flight if independencematerializes this time, but estimated that at least three-quartersof the Afrikaners, himself included, would stay and give blackmajority rule a try.   ``After all these years of fighting to save this country forcivilization, they feel they have to stay and work for the best,''he said. ``People are sick and tired of war.''   Hattingh, a Windhoek automobile dealer who is president ofNamibia's Chamber of Commerce, said white businessmen hope for asurge of foreign investment after independence frees Namibia frominternational sanctions imposed on South Africa. But he worriesabout what might happen if SWAPO wins outright control of thegovernment and moves to nationalize ranches and mines, the mainrevenue producers.   He said SWAPO's announced intention to reduce economic ties withSouth Africa could be devastating. The territory receives most ofits imports from South Africa, its only rail link to the outsideworld is through South Africa, and its only deepwater port _ WalvisBay _ is a South African-owned enclave that South Africa refuses toyield.   Other neighboring black-run nations continue to trade with SouthAfrica because without trade and trade routes their economies wouldbe seriously damaged.   If Namibia suffers a manpower shortage because whiteprofessionals and technicians leave, ``it's our own mistake,''Hattingh said.   ``We suppressed them (blacks). We didn't give them a chance inthe past,'' he said.   The largest white political faction, the National Party ofSouth-West Africa, opposes one-person, one-vote elections and isclinging to its support of segregated schools and hospitals, eventhough both are apt to be abolished by any new government. The partyis predominantly Afrikaner, and SWAPO plans to end Afrikaans' statusas an official language alongside English.   ``We believe that if forced apartheid is wrong, then forcedintegration is wrong,'' said Kosie Pretorius, the National Partyleader.   ``Everyone who's leaving the country is making it more difficultfor those who stay,'' he said. ``I am adamant to stay. ... But ifthings become unbearable, we'll have to look at it again.''   According to Ekandjo, even a segregationist like Pretorius iswelcome to remain, ``as long as he obeys the law. He can think whathe wants.''   To many Namibians, black and white, Zimbabwe offers anencouraging example.   Nine years after white-ruled Rhodesia became black-ruledZimbabwe, about 100,000 whites remain, compared with a peak whitepopulation of 275,000. In South Africa, pro-government media oftendepict Zimbabwean whites' life as unpleasant, but in Namibia theimage is different.   ``In Zimbabwe, whites are still living very, very comfortably,''Hattingh said. ``They don't want to leave. If they can do it, we cando it, too.''   Some Zimbabwean whites have stayed because of restrictions ontaking money abroad. In Namibia, Pretorius said, some whites haveshifted their funds to South Africa while remaining in the territoryto see how the elections turn out.   Hattingh said many Namibian whites had no deep affection forSouth Africa and felt its white leaders had used Namibia as atesting ground for racial reforms they were reluctant to try at home.   Moses Katjiuongua, a black member of the territorial Cabinet whois expected to help lead a moderate alliance against SWAPO in theelections, urged whites to ``stay here and fight to make this abetter country, a non-ethnic democratic country.''   If this happened, he said, ``we could induce South Africans tosee that blacks and whites can live together. We can change SouthAfrica in a positive way.''   De Klerk expressed concern that some blacks had unreasonableexpectations about life after independence.   ``The disillusionment will be so harsh for them,'' he said.``They're under the impression they will get a house, a car and acheckbook after independence.''   Most whites, he added, wonder: ``Do we have assurances that lawand order will be adequate, that our lifestyle will be safe?''   De Klerk, who came to Namibia from South Africa 16 years ago,said he felt a duty to stay and help reassure fellow Afrikaners whodo likewise.   ``Maybe, just maybe, this is the hour of glory for theAfrikaners, not the hour of doomsday,'' he said. ``To black people,we've always been the damned apartheid people, the bosses. Now, wecan be what we've always preached _ true Christians who love otherpeople and want to help them.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Jan. 29</NOTE></DOC>
