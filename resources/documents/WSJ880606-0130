The value of the projects weren't made public. Telefonica officials said the two parties will also discuss ventures in fiber optics, the production of radio-transmitter emergency buoys for shipping, and the marketing abroad of part of these ventures' production.    MONTEDISON S.p.A. said it received several offers for its Standa S.p.A. department-store chain, including one from Italian television magnate Silvio Berlusconi. Standa, which is 70%-owned by Montedison's Iniziativa Me.T.A. unit, has long been a rumored divestment candidate. The Carrefour group of France and Italy's state-owned Societa Meridionale Finanziaria are also said to be interested in the company. Italian press reports said Mr. Berlusconi was offering 750 billion lire ($585 million) for Iniziativa Me.T.A.'s 70% stake, about double the market price. Last year, Standa had profit of 24.4 billion lire on sales of 2.901 trillion lire.    STORA AB'S pretax profit rose 19% to one billion kronor ($165.7 million) in the first four months of 1988 from 840 million kronor a year earlier, helped by higher pulp prices and strength in its packaging, paper and board operations. The Swedish forestry giant, which said it intends to carry through with its 5.9 billion-kronor bid for SWEDISH MATCH AB, said sales rose 8% to 7.31 billion kronor ($1.21 billion) from 6.77 billion kronor. Swedish Match, meantime, said pretax profit jumped 52% in the first four months of this year to 254 million kronor from 167 million kronor a year earlier, while sales increased 17% to 5.67 billion kronor from 4.83 billion kronor. </TEXT></DOC>
