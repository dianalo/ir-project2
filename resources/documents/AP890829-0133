As scientists held a final news conference at NASA's JetPropulsion Laboratory to summarize Voyager 2's discoveries, theone-ton spacecraft was 2.76 billion miles from Earth and 4.2 millionmiles beyond Neptune, the solar system's fourth-largest andcurrently most-distant planet.   Voyager also was nearly 4.5 billion miles along a curving paththat took it from Earth in 1977, past Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in1981 and Uranus in 1986, and now past Neptune in search of the edgeof the solar system. Voyager 1 explored Jupiter in 1979 and Saturnin 1980.   For $865 million _ 20 cents per year per American since theproject started _ the twin Voyagers visited four planets with atleast 56 moons, discovering at least 23 of the satellites andexamining worlds of wonder, like Jupiter's moon Io, with itssulfur-spewing volcanoes.   ``As exciting as the discoveries at Neptune have been, thisencounter has really just been the fourth and final planet thatVoyager has revealed in an unprecedented decade of discovery in itsjourney through the outer solar system,'' said Voyager projectscientist Edward Stone. ``For those of us fortunate enough to beinvolved, this has been the journey of a lifetime.''   At Neptune, Voyager 2 discovered six moons in addition to Nereidand Triton, which were first detected from Earth. It discoveredthree thin rings of debris and two broad rings orbiting the planet.It found at least six moonlets hidden in one of the rings.   The spacecraft detected in Neptune's bluish atmosphere anEarth-sized swirling storm called the Great Dark Spot, 720 mphwinds, photochemical smog, invisible ultraviolet auroras and cirrusclouds of natural gas casting shadows on clouds far below.   Voyager revealed two bizarre types of ice volcanoes on icy,pinkish Triton. The first kind are calderas _ 1,000-foot-deepcraters measuring hundreds of miles across _ that producedocean-size floods of ice flowing like lava, probably no morerecently than a half billion years ago, said U.S. Geological Surveygeologist Laurence Soderblom.   The second type can erupt explosively, ejecting nitrogen ice andgas 25 miles high at speeds of 560 mph _ higher and faster thaninitially estimated, he said. He said he suspects the nitrogenvolcanoes are active today or were active within the past 300 years.   Soderblom drew gasps of amazement when he showed a Voyagerphotograph of one of the calderas, computer enhanced to make it lookas it would to someone standing on Triton's surface and seeing thecrater in three dimensions.   Scientists also presented new findings Tuesday showing Neptune'sweak, tilted magnetic field doesn't go through the center of planetbut is offset about four-tenths of the way toward the surface. That,plus new evidence that matter is distributed unevenly inside theplanet, suggests the liquid that generates the magnetic field mayexist in a shallow spherical shell, not in a deep central core asinside the Earth.   ``These observations are just as arcane as the discoveries ofCaptain Cook or even the posthumous accounts of Magellan,'' saidPlanetary Society vice president Bruce Murray, former director ofJet Propulsion Laboratory. ``The discoveries challenge ourimagination and seem just like science fiction. But they may be veryimportant and very relevant to our grandchildren and theirgrandchildren.''   The knowledge gathered by the Voyagers may help alert their humanmasters to the vulnerability of Earth, a tiny garden threatened bynuclear warfare, the greenhouse effect and destruction of the ozoneshield.   ``If you look who discovered these dangers ... you find aremarkable preponderance of present and past planetary scientists,''Sagan said.   He said Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina first warned ofdepletion of Earth's ozone layer using chemical formulas devised tohelp NASA understand the atmosphere of Venus. Molina now works atJet Propulsion Laboratory.   Sagan and other planetary scientists developed the theory thatsmoke from nuclear war could plunge Earth into a dark, cold nuclearwinter and cause mass starvation of those who survived the exchangeof warheads.   ``The idea ultimately evolved from our attempt to understand thegreat Martian dust storm of 1971-72,'' which was detected by Mariner9 and chilled Mars' already cold surface, Sagan said.   From Mariner and the space probe Pioneer, scientists studied therunaway ``greenhouse effect'' on Venus, where thick clouds trapsolar heat, warming the planet to 900 degrees.   Sagan said Voyager also helps satisfy human wanderlust and seeksto answer that most fundamental question _ ``where we come from, howwe fit into the grand cosmological scheme.''   Voyager 2 keeps looking back at Neptune until Oct. 2. Then, likeVoyager 1, it will spend the next 20 or 30 years collectinginformation about particles and magnetic fields in space andsearching for the edge of the solar system. Scientists figure theprobes can continue transmitting data until 2020.</TEXT></DOC>
