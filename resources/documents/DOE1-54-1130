<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-54-1130 </DOCNO><TEXT>If the conventional strong phonon-mediated pairing is responsible forthe high-temperature superconductivity of the Cu oxides, then a strongenhancement of the Raman activity at frequencies close to twice the superconductinggap can be expected. For other pairing mechanisms this effect is absent.</TEXT></DOC>
