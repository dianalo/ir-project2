Mr. Carlsson arranged the accord with visiting Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, the highest-ranking Soviet official to visit Sweden in 15 years. The leaders will sign the accord today.    The Baltic agreement was dislcosed yesterday, the second day of Mr. Ryzhkov's five-day tour of Sweden and Norway. The agreement over commercial rights in the Baltic will give Sweden the right to exploit fishing, mineral and other resources in the easternmost 75% of an elongated region that lies between the Swedish island of Gotland and the Soviet coast. The Soviet Union will have commercial rights in the remaining 25% of the zone, which is rich in salmon, cod and herring and may contain oil deposits.    To offset the imbalance, Soviet fishermen will be entitled to take as much as 18,000 tons of fish a year from the Swedish area. Swedish fishermen will be permitted to take as much as 6,000 tons of fish from the Soviet side of the zone. In 20 years, the quotas are to be renegotiated.    Swedish and Soviet officials expressed satisfaction with the agreement. Some Swedish officials said the accord resulted from a softening of the Soviet stance on the region. Mr. Carlsson attributed the change to a &quot;new&quot; Soviet foreign policy under Mikhail Gorbachev.    Until yesterday, Moscow publicly had maintained that its commercial rights extended to a line midway between the western Soviet coast and Sweden's main coastline. Sweden had said that its commercial rights extended to midway between Gotland's eastern coast and the Soviet Union.    To keep tensions down over the past two decades, both countries have refrained from full use of the zone's resources. As a result, the disputed region was fished mainly by vessels from other countries. Swedish officials estimate that 75,000 tons of fish, valued at about $80 million, are netted in the zone each year, most of it by Danish and West German fishermen.    The new agreement will at least temporarily shut out the fishing vessels of other countries that have been using the region while Sweden and the Soviet Union worked out their differences. Stefan de Mare, an assistant undersecretary of agriculture, said Sweden would open negotiations soon with the European Community on sharing commercial rights in the region. An EC spokesman said last night that he wasn't aware of the agreement between Sweden and the Soviet Union.    The Baltic pact covers only commercial uses of the zone, but apparently satisfies worries expressed by Swedish defense officials about ceding commercial rights too close to a naval base on north Gotland. Like most nations, Sweden considers sovereign only the waters within 12 miles of its coast.    Talks on other commercial matters also have made headway during Premier Ryzhkov's visit. Two Swedish companies, Swedegas AB and OK Petroleum AB, announced that they have agreed to start formal negotiations to buy Soviet natural gas for distribution in central Sweden and the Stockholm area. Both indicated that they eventually want to buy as much as 35 billion cubic feet of gas a year, valued at at least 500 million Swedish kronor ($84.23 million), starting in the early 1990s. In addition, Axel Johnson AB said it already has signed a letter of intent to buy as much as 400 million cubic meters of Soviet gas a year, which it then would sell on to one of the gas distributors.    Separately, a Swedish contracting group, SIAB AB, said it has formed a joint venture with a Swedish travel agency, Reso AB, and the Soviet Intourist travel group to redevelop Leningrad's Hotel Europe. The project, the first Swedish-Soviet joint venture since Moscow began soliciting such projects last year, is valued at about 300 million kronor. </TEXT></DOC>
