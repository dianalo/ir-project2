Michelle Anderson, 21, who represented Santa Cruz County, waspulled from the stage by security guards Monday night as she yelledthat the winner had bruises all over her body because she sufferedfrom a weight-loss illness, anorexia.   The 26-year-old winner, who wore the banner of the city ofLomita, had little to say about the incident.   ``There's nothing I can really say at this moment that would bein good taste so I'd rather not comment, but she and I don't seeeye to eye,'' said Miss Ricardos.   The 65th Miss California pageant was the third at the San DiegoCivic Center, where it was moved from Santa Cruz after protestswith crowds up to 1,000 marred previous contests.   Ten finalists chosen from a pool of 42 during preliminarycontests over the weekend participated in the finals televisedaround the state. The judges rated the women on the basis ofswimsuit and talent competition and interviews.   Miss Anderson, who wasn't one of the finalists, said she hadplanned all year to stage the protest.   ``The whole point is that pageants hurt all women,'' MissAnderson said outside the Civic Center. ``They hurt women who areon the inside because they are bruised psychologically andphysically by what they must endure to become queens.   ``Pageants hurt women on the outside because (the contestants)are an icon that we must all look up to and that we're all supposedto emulate, but that makes us unhealthy and promotes anorexia andbulimia and cosmetic surgery.''   Miss Ricardos will represent the state in the Miss AmericaPageant in Atlantic City in September. She also won $20,000 inscholarships, wardrobe money and gifts.   Miss Ricardos, first runner up the past two years, said shewould use the money to further her college education and career.She sang ``I Dreamed a Dream'' during the talent competition.   ``It's extremely exciting because I've been working on this forsix years,'' Miss Ricardos said of the pageant. ``It's a wonderfulway for women to pay for their education.''   In previous years, pageant protesters have focused on racism andsexism they say is promoted by the contest. But, with the contestitself 65-years-old, protesters said they decided to focus on agediscrimination.   ``We're here to celebrate women's diversity,'' said AnnSimonton, a 35-year-old former model who led the protest by a SantaCruz-based group, MediaWatch.   Ms. Simonton, covergirl of the 1974 Sports Illustrated swimsuitedition who has been arrested several times during previousprotests, wore a trash can with a banner that read, ``Mis-Erable.''   ``I feel older women are ignored to a large degree in oursociety and they're relegated to a trash can which is why I'memphasizing it by being dressed this way,'' Ms. Simonton said.   Several dozen demonstrators wearing makeup, worn clothes andwigs carried signs saying, ``Slaves to Stereotypes,'' ``There'sLife at 44, and ``Beauty Comes In All Types of Packages.''   About a dozen police officers monitored the protests. There wereno arrests.   Pageant organizers say the contest promotes the things for womenthat protesters want, better education and equality in the workplace.</TEXT></DOC>
