Like an elderly uncle, the April figure due out tomorrow will be greeted perfunctorily by economists who are eager to move along to Friday's more dynamic data on May employment.    Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, sums up the usual reception the index receives: &quot;Fine . . . next number? The index is a number I can't get excited about,&quot; he says.    Born in the throes of the Depression, the index has become the government's chief forecasting tool. An amalgam of 11 components (most previously reported), the index functions as an early alert on the economy's ups and downs six to nine months into the future. But it has been showing its age in recent years as a more sophisticated economy increasingly grew through the service sector. The Commerce Department plans to upgrade the index eventually, and the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University already has a modernized, expanded version in place.    Geoffrey Moore, who heads the center, said that based on recent behavior of the center's so-called long-leading index, he expects the government's leading indicators to show a modest increase in the April report. For March, the Commerce Department reported a 0.8% rise in the index after a 1.3% climb in February.    But as recently as the start of this year, economists were keeping a wary eye on consecutive declines in the index. A longstanding rule of thumb holds that three consecutive months of decline presage a recession.    More recently, the Columbia group in conjunction with the Coalition of Service Industries Inc. began tracking activity in the service sector. The latest reading of its services coincident index shows a growth rate of 2.5% for March, down from 3.8% in February. As growth rates in the measure have been in the 2.5%-to-3.5% range since 1986, recent readings suggest that the service sector's contribution to the economy will be relatively modest this year.    As for the government's index of leading indicators, neither Mr. Moore nor other economists expect the government's April index to maintain the gains of the previous two months.    &quot;April was a mixed bag,&quot; said Maury Harris, chief economist at PaineWebber Inc. &quot;Building permits were down and stock prices may have hurt a bit,&quot; he added.    Fine. Next number?    The May employment data will be minutely examined by economists who are sifting for clues to the pace of inflation and interest rates. &quot;Inflation is a key determinant of the capital markets right now,&quot; said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co. So, both economists and traders are monitoring &quot;whatever affects inflation, growth and the Fed.&quot; The Federal Reserve recently began tightening credit in its effort to control inflation and there's more than academic interest in divining whether more rate boosts may be in store.    Many economists expect another increase in overall employment for May, although probably not as big a jump as in recent months. The April report showed a drop in the jobless rate to a 14-year low, raising concerns that the economy and inflation may overheat. The April rate fell to 5.4% of the civilian labor force from 5.6% the previous month.    Some economists plan to zero in on the hourly wage data in the report. &quot;'Factory hours worked' is the single most important thing in that whole report,&quot; said Chase Manhattan's Mr. Fine. He expects hourly wages to be unchanged from April's 41.2-hour level. But that's largely because &quot;April was so darned high, I'm hard put to forecast a higher number,&quot; he added. Longer work weeks coupled with rising wages are just the sort of signs economists watch for a reading on whether the Fed will tighten credit further.    When factory workers are busy, it stands to reason that factories are smoking, too. Expectations are for a jump of as much as 1% in April manufacturing orders due out tomorrow. In March, factory orders rose a hearty 1.6% to $216.08 billion. Economists figure inventories continued to rise in April, but not as fast as shipments, indicating that future production may also be strong.    Construction spending in April could be at the mercy of statistical revisions. If March's 1.5% gain stands firm, then the April outlay may show a small decline, according to economists at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. But if March is revised downward, as they expect, the April report could register a gain.    In the big-ticket consumer area, May auto sales probably held their own despite some falloff in the mid-month sales pace as car makers revamped their incentive programs. Nonetheless, economists believe auto makers are sticking to souped-up production schedules as revised incentive plans draw buyers.    New home sales are another matter. A decline in single-family housing starts in April suggests that home sales were off slightly, leaving the inventory of unsold homes &quot;at a somewhat uncomfortable seven-month level,&quot; according to Manufacturers Hanover economists.    ---                The Economy in Numbers -      Statistics Released in the Week Ended May 27                                        CHANGE                                        (from prior                              TOTAL     period)    Money Supply      M1 Week ended May 16      (in billions)           $768.1    -$1.5      M2 Week ended May 16      (in trillions)          $3.0024   +$.0025      M3 Week ended May 16      (in trillions)          $3.7753   -$.0003    Durable goods orders    April, (in billions)      $116.28   +0.8%    New jobless claims    Week ended May 14         305,000   -1.6%    Sindlinger consumer    confidence percent    Three-day period    (May 24-25-26)            64.5      -0.2%    Auto sales    Mid-May, total vs.    year ago                  216,325   -2.2%    Real GNP    1988 1st quarter    revised annual rate    (in trillions)            $3.918    +3.9%    Personal Income    April, annual rate    (in trillions)            $3.944    +0.1%    Personal consumption    April, annual rate    (in trillions)            $3.098    Unch.
