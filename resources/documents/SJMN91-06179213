Create a paste first by mixing one partmix to one part warm water and lumps will be minimized. For thickening use onepart water to one part flour.;    MELT CHEESES: Cheese tends to become clumpedor stringy when added directly to dishes with a watery base such as stews orsoups. It is better to melt the cheese first and then add it to the dish.;   WIND SCREENS, LIDS: Remember that cooking at altitude will affect the time ittakes to cook a meal because the air pressure is lower. In addition, wind andcold temperatures will draw heat away from the stove and pot. It is importantto use a good wind screen, a snug-fitting lid and cook in as sheltered an areaas possible. You can fashion your own wind screen out of heavy-gauge aluminumfoil. Using a three-foot by two-foot section, fold the foil in halflengthwise. You should now have a three-foot by one-foot section that can beformed into a circle and placed around your cookpot and stove. Be sure toleave a small area where air can circulate or your stove's flame will go out.;   A PINCH OF SALT: Bland food is very often due to a lack of salt or otherspices, but most usually salt. Salt can easily be overdone, especially if theingredients you are using are salty themselves. However, a pinch of salt orsalt substitute does tend to bring out the flavor in foods.;    TIMING ISIMPORTANT: Undercooking or overcooking is frequently caused by either addingingredients in the wrong order or poor timing. Always add freeze-dried foodsfirst, before adding additional rice or pasta. If you are adding thickeners,milk or cheese to the dish, add them just before the dish is done.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MICHAEL HODGSON, Special to Venture  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910627  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  428  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday June 27, 199100179213,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
