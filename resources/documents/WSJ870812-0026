Ciba-Geigy Corp. has asked a federal court for a temporary restraining order blocking Schering-Plough from starting to ship the new gum later this month. In its lawsuit filed Monday in Manhattan, the Summit, N.J., unit of Ciba-Geigy Ltd., of Switzerland, alleges that its competitor's new product is of &quot;dubious efficacy.&quot;    Ciba-Geigy, which sells Acutrim appetite-suppressant tablets, claims Stay Trim gum isn't effective, won't keep off weight and doesn't work faster than diet pills, as it says Schering-Plough's advertising will claim.    In a statement, Schering-Plough, which also markets the Fibre Trim diet aid, said Ciba-Geigy's claims are &quot;without factual or legal merit.&quot; It added: &quot;Our product is safe and effective, and will be vigorously defended against claims of competitors obviously concerned with marketing threats to their own products.&quot;    Schering-Plough said Stay Trim will be the first nationally available diet gum to contain Phenylpropanolamine HCI, or PPA, a government-approved appetite suppressant. </TEXT></DOC>
