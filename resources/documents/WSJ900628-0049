White   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>06/28/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C1</SO><CO>   LABOR IBM XON GE GM T DD NYN F</CO><IN>MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND)</IN><LP>   NEW YORK -- The remarkable growth of the nation's biggestpension funds is concentrating stock ownership and votingpower in fewer and fewer hands.   While much attention has been given to the rapid growth ofU.S. pension funds, including almost a tripling of theirassets in the 1980s alone, new statistics show the biggest ofthe big funds have expanded even more significantly.</LP><TEXT>   Between 1985 and 1989, for example, assets of all pensionfunds climbed to $2.47 trillion from $1.59 trillion, anincrease of 55%. During the same time, the 20 biggestcorporate and public employee pension funds grew to $621.76billion from $336.53 billion, an 85% jump, according tostatistics compiled by the Columbia University Law SchoolInstitutional Investor Project.   The accelerated growth among the giants of the pensionworld means that the 20 biggest retirement funds now accountfor more than 25% of all pension assets, including stocks,bonds and other investments, up from slightly more than 21%in 1985.   &quot;We see a tremendous concentration of economic power inthe biggest institutional investors,&quot; says Carolyn KayBrancato, economist for the Columbia project. Whileinstitutional investors number in the thousands, adisproportionate share of their power &quot;is being crystalizedin a small group&quot; of the biggest funds, she says.   The growing clout of these pension giants is particularlyevident in the stock market and, especially, their holdingsof America's biggest companies. For example, the 20 biggestpension funds owned 9.1% of International Business MachinesCorp. and 10.6% of General Motors Corp. at the end of 1989.   And the rapid growth of the biggest pension funds isputting more power in the hands of those institutionalinvestors most likely to try to use it.   Last year, institutional holders showed their clout bymanaging to defeat anti-takeover proxy proposals made byHoneywell Inc. management. And Texaco Inc. last year agreedto name a director from candidates submitted by the $54billion California Public Employees Retirement System.   The biggest institutional shareholders say their growingsize shouldn't be viewed as a threat to companies'managements. &quot;There is more concentration, but there is moresophistication&quot; among the biggest shareholders, says RolandM. Machold, director of the New Jersey Division ofInvestment, which oversees $24.5 billion in state pensionmoney. &quot;That is an opportunity to work together,&quot; he says.   Still, this growing concentration of stock ownership in afew hands has the potential to shift the balance of powerbetween shareholders and corporate managements.   &quot;The model of {publicly traded} companies as owned bythousands of anonymous stockholders simply isn't true,&quot; saysBernard Black, a former Securities and Exchange Commissionaide who now is a Columbia law professor. &quot;There are alimited number of large shareholders, and they know eachother.&quot;   But even the biggest institutional investors don't move inunison. GM sparked ire from some institutional holders whenit included a measure to increase pension benefits sharplyfor Chairman Roger Smith, who is to retire Aug. 1, and otherGM executives. While New York state's public employee pensionsystem voted against the GM proposal, the California fundvoted to approve it.   The fastest-growing retirement systems are those for stateand local public employees. These public funds have taken thelead in challenging corporate managements in proxy votes andpressing their own suggestions about the way companies shouldbe run. State systems such as Wisconsin's $20.03 billion fundare doubling in size every five years, and the Californiapublic employees fund is expected to reach $1 trillion by theyear 2014.   Public funds account for 13 of the 20 largest pensionfunds, according to the most recent tally by Pensions andInvestments, a trade publication.   In addition to outpacing the asset growth of corporatefunds, public funds are allocating much of their new wealthto stocks, reducing their traditional reliance on moreconservative bond holdings. As late as 1968, public funds inCalifornia and 15 other states didn't hold any stocks intheir portfolios. In 1970, according to New York StockExchange statistics, stocks equaled less than 17% of theassets of state and local pension funds. But by 1988, theirstockholdings more than doubled to 37% of their portfolios.Today, California's two giant state funds hold a total of $38billion in stocks.   Corporate pension funds, meanwhile, cut their portfolioallocations to stocks to 45% in 1988 from 60% in 1970,according to the Big Board. Corporate plans remain muchbigger stock investors in dollar terms, however, and heldshares equal to 20.8% of the exchange's total capitalizationat the end of 1988, compared with 9.1% for public plans.   With fewer conflicts of interest than other institutionalinvestors, public pension funds -- as well as mutual funds,the second-biggest accumulators of stock in the 1980s --&quot;will be more likely to advance their own proposals andoppose management proposals,&quot; Mr. Black, the Columbiaprofessor, says.   Pension fund officials often argue that their ability togang up on companies is greatly exaggerated. Their forces aredivided, because corporate pension funds play almost no rolein anti-management fights, and many, if not most, publicpension funds have neither the stomach nor the resources toenter proxy frays, fund officials say.   New York State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, who controlsthe state's largest pension fund, says that &quot;even thoughthere appears to be a lot of power on the institutional side,there is a lot of countervailing power&quot; for companies'managements in the form of state anti-takeover laws, theadvantages that the SEC proxy voting system gives managersand in poison-pill and other corporate defenses.   Yet another constraint is the maze of SEC regulations thatprevent a pension fund from acquiring more than 5% of acompany's stock without incurring complicated disclosurerequirements. Still other rules effectively ban funds fromdiscussing proxy matters with more than nine fellowshareholders unless they want to begin a formalproxy-solicitation process.   But pension funds are pushing proposals to get the SEC tooverhaul its rules for proxy contests, and the agency says itis considering changes.   ---           Top 20 Pension Funds Jump in Size...          ...And Raise Their Stakes in Big Firms                                                                                                        (In millions of dollars)       1985*    1989*   PCT.
