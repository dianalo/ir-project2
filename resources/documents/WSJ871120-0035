The biotechnology concern earlier licensed world-wide marketing rights to its genetically engineered version of the drug to Sandoz, which is conducting clinical trials with it. Under the new agreement, Genetics Institute will provide the drug to Sandoz, a Swiss drug maker, for both clinical tests and commercial sales.    Terms of the contract weren't disclosed, but analysts said Genetics Institute probably will get at least 10% of the eventual sales of the drug for manufacturing it, plus additional royalties under its earlier licensing agreement with Sandoz.    GM-CSF, or granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor, is a naturally occurring substance that promotes growth of white blood cells that fight invading microbes. Doctors hope the drug will help patients whose immune systems have been weakened by acquired immune deficiency syndrome, anti-cancer drugs and other factors. The drug has performed well in early clinical trials, and some analysts believe that it may reach the market within two years.    The manufacturing contract underscores Genetics Institute's growing capacity to manufacture genetically engineered drugs. The company plans to open a new drug production facility in Andover, Mass., next year and has formed a joint venture with Wellcome PLC, a British drug company, to build a $40 million plant by the end of 1989.    Among biotechnology companies, &quot;Genetics Institute will soon be second only to Genentech in manufacturing capabilities,&quot; said Kathy Behrens, an analyst with San Francisco-based Robertson, Colman andamp; Stephens.    Gabriel Schmergel, Genetics Institute's president and chief executive officer, said it expects to get manufacturing contracts for several other drugs that it has developed and licensed to large drug companies. </TEXT></DOC>
