Viacom owns MTV, Showtime, The Movie Channel and distributionrights to ``The Cosby Show,'' ``Roseanne'' and ``A DifferentWorld'' as well as 14 cable TV systems, five television stationsand eight radio stations.   Viacom is 83 percent owned by National Amusements Inc., aDedham, Mass., movie theater chain that bought its stake for $460million in cash and $2.8 billion in new and old debt in a leveragedbuyout in 1987.   The New York-based company said Thursday the refinancing wasmade possible by an increase in the value of its assets and theflow of cash from its operations, marking the success of the buyout.   The 10-year agreement with its bank lenders, led by Citibankwith Bank of New York as co-agent, gives it up to $1.5 billion inunsecured bank loans and revolving credit. It does not have to payany principal for three years.   The agreement permits the company to borrow an additional $500million by issuing commercial paper backed up by a portion of thebank lending. Viacom will use part of the proceeds to retire $200million of its $1.3 billion in outstanding junk bonds.   ``The closing of this credit agreement is a watershed event forour company,'' Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman, and Frank J.Biondi Jr., the president and chief executive, said in a jointstatement.   ``By terminating our old credit agreement we have left behindthe restrictiveness of the LBO structure and have put in place amore flexible capitalization,'' they said.   The new agreement frees Viacom to issue more debt, which couldbe used for acquisitions. Spokesman Thomas Dooley said the companyhas not announced any plans, but added, ``We do remainopportunistic.''</TEXT></DOC>
