Reportershave been arrested, newspapers closed, and sources silenced.   The Israeli government insists journalists are jailed only forillegal acts. Palestinians and others say the press is beingpunished for reporting the truth and tarnishing Israel's image.   The army has arrested at least 30 Palestinian journalists sinceDec. 8 and jailed 20 of them for up to six months without charges,said Marty Rosenbluth of Al Haq, an Arab human rights group based inthe West Bank town of Ramallah.   ``The authorities are trying to restrict any information goingout,'' said Rosenbluth, an American from New York. ``They arebasically trying to block people from finding out what is happeninghere.''   Before the uprising, authorities sometimes briefly closed one oranother of the four Palestinian newspapers in Arab east Jerusalem oncharges of violating military censorship.   In the past six months, they ordered a six-month closure of thePalestine Press Service, a news agency serving the foreign press,and shut down Al Awda, an affiliated weekly published in English andArabic.   During a tour of the Ketziot prison in Israel's Negev Desert,foreign reporters met six Palestinian journalists who had beendetained without trial.   Qassem Ali, a free-lance reporter who worked part time for TheAssociated Press, said authorities accused him of being politicallyactive.   ``But I believe I am here because I am a journalist,'' said Ali,who had escorted foreign television crews and reporters through GazaStrip refugee camps and arranged interviews.   One recently released detainee is Samaan Khouri, a reporter forthe French news agency Agence France Presse and former editor of theEnglish-language edition of Al Fajr, a pro-Palestine LiberationOrganization newspaper in Jerusalem.   Khouri said authorities did not really mind reports of theuprising reaching the Arab population. But they were worried aboutthe help Palestinian journalists gave to the foreign press.   Israeli officials deny the government is trying to muzzle thepress.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said recently: ``Measures have notbeen taken against newspapers or journalists because of theirprofessional activity but because of violations against Israel'slaws.''   He did not elaborate, and the army refused to explain why it isholding Arab journalists or how many of them are in jail.   In covering the uprising, the foreign press often has depended onPalestinian sources for the first news of violence and forunderstanding the Palestinian viewpoint. Part of the reason has beenthe army's slowness in issuing reports.   ``The role of the Palestinian press has been more of a bridge tothe outside world than anything having to do with the intefadeh(uprising) itself,'' said Khouri, who served 4{ months in Ramleprison.   Many of the Arab journalists arrested have escorted foreignreporters to the occupied territories, arranged interviews andhelped gain details on protests and clashes.   ``That's why the Israelis closed down the Palestine Press Serviceand arrested journalists who have contacts with the foreign press,''said Khouri. ``They want to cut off these relations.''   He also attributed his arrest to being on the executive committeeof the Palestine Journalists' Union, representing 160 Arab reporters.   The group's leader, Rajwan Abu Ayyash, was freed from jail a fewdays after Khouri. Government officials said the release followed anappeal by the Israeli Journalists' Union.   Amnon Nadav, the union leader, said Jewish journalists havefought for the release of detained Palestinian reporters since thebeginning of the uprising.   ``We regard them as professional colleagues and view theirdetention as the beginning of a process that could affect us all,''Nadav said.   Left-wing Israeli media also are affected by the government'sefforts to control coverage of the uprising.   In February, the government revoked the printing license ofDerech Nanitzotz, a Communist weekly run by Israeli Jews and printedin Hebrew and Arabic.   In May, the government charged four of the paper's editors withbeing members of the Democratic Front for the Liberation ofPalestine, a Moscow-affiliated faction of the PLO.   Hadas Lahav, a Derech Hanitzotz editor released after 12 days ofpolice questioning, said the paper's closing and charges against hercolleagues were part of a campaign to silence coverage of the unrest.   She said the government trumped up charges against her colleaguesto stop them from reporting on the unrest.</TEXT></DOC>
