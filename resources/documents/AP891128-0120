Sakharov andother human rights campaigners.   Sergei Kuznetsov was found guilty of slandering a local InteriorMinistry official and resisting arrest in the Siberian city ofSverdlovsk, said Andrei Mironov, a Moscow-based journalist andhuman rights activist.   Human rights activists say the charges were trumped up tosilence Kuznetsov, 32.   He is editor of his own unofficial journal as well as acontributor to some of the best-known non-official publicationsthat have sprung up in Moscow in the freer atmosphere of PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.   Mironov said the trial showed that despite Gorbachev's reformsthat freed hundreds of political prisoners, ``the system ofrepression has been preserved.''   Kuznetsov attended his trial lying down because of a prolongedhunger strike against the accusations, Mironov said.   Several weeks ago, Moscow activists quoted Kuznetsov's lawyer assaying the editor had been pushed down a flight of stairs at theSverdlovsk courthouse by police after a court hearing.   Sakharov and other human rights activists issued a protest afterthat, and Mironov on Tuesday quoted the 1975 Nobel Peace Prizewinner as saying he could not support an international human rightsconference in the Soviet Union in 1991 if Kuznetsov was imprisoned.</TEXT></DOC>
