 Of course, every vendor has an answer and wants everycustomer to believe that his is the only answer for future network cableneeds.andP;  Truth be known, the ultimate future network cabling system may be nocable at all.andP;  We already have hints of this with infrared networks, likePhotonet, and radio-oriented networks; and with the development of technologysuch as CAMA and CDMA, the evolution to non-cable-oriented transmissiontechnologies is real and has already begun.andM;In the meantime, though, we still have a need for cable to slake networkthirsts.andP;  So we're back to the original question: which cable to use?andM;Ask any vendor, and the two most common answers for future network cabletechnologies are twisted-pair and fiber-optic.andP;  In fact, it is widelyacknowledged that fiber to the desktop is the &quot;wave of the future.&quot;andP;  Bothfiber and copper twisted-pair have been around for a while, but the maindifference today is that developments in transmission technologies allow theuse of these media in new ways and at much higher speeds.andM;Fiber aside for now, the real controversy these days--on the eve ofSeptember's 10Base-T standard vote for 802.3 CSMA/CD (carrier sense multipleaccess/collision detection) networks--is over twisted-pair and the vendors ofsame.andP;  Some vendors provide an unshielded twisted-pair solution and some havesought to shield the twisted-pair.andP;  Both have merit, but only one can providea solution until the need for fiber arrives.andM;In my 20 years of experience with twisted-pair, the main problem I've foundis that sales and support teams--as well as customers--are uneducated on whattwisted-pair is and when it should and should not be used.andP;  There aresituations when twisted-pair cabling is a superior solution for many years,and there are times when twisted-pair cabling is the proverbial Pandora'sbox.andP;  Twisted-pair is frequently misunderstood and misused in networkapplications.andM;Twisted-pair cabling originally came about as a solution to the problem ofcrosstalk on early multipair, multiwire cables, which were not twisted.andO;Crosstalk, which is basically interference, occurred between voice pairs inthe multiwire cabling when energy radiated from one pair and &quot;spilled over&quot;into another.andM;It was discovered that when the wire pairs are coupled, with each pairtwisted at a different rate, the energy radiated from current in any one wireis almost completely canceled out by radiation from the same current on thereturn wire of the pair.andP;  As a result, the energy radiated into the otherpairs in the overall cable is minimal and not disruptive.andP;  That meansvirtually no crosstalk.andM;An additional benefit of the twist in the cable is that the pairs become lesssusceptible to external noise--provided they are properly twisted, terminatedand used.andM;This is all well and good for voice transmission, but the probability ofproblems increases along with the frequency of the signals.andP;  For twisted-pairtelephone wire, at voice frequencies, the physical dimensions of the pair ofwire and the average twist length (the distance between successive twists)are much less than the wavelength of signals placed on the wire.andM;Theoretically, the twist causes the cable to be &quot;balanced&quot;; that is, energyis equal in both wires of the pair at any point in space.andP;  The compressedvoice signal on a telephone pair may be as small as 1kHz with a wavelengththat is almost 115 miles.andP;  The typical twist length of telephone cable is sixinches, so a balance of energy is theoretically and realistically possible.andM;The problem for twisted-pair occurs when the wavelength is shortened athigher frequencies.andP;  In that event, the theory of balance energy is notachieved and the probability of crosstalk and external noise interferenceincreases exponentially with frequency.andM;In other words, the shorter the wavelength with telephone twisted-pair, thegreater the chance of distortion and interference of the signal beinggenerated.andP;  This problem is especially pronounced with megabit-level datacommunications.andM;Some of the very large computing companies and other entities have conductedextensive research and measurements comparing different twisted-pairenvironments, and the effects of shielding twisted-pair and variousnoise-generating environments.andP;  For example, in 1984 NCR showed that if thedata rate on unshielded twisted-pair cable was increased from 1Mbit persecond (Mbps) to 4Mbps, the peak noise amplitude increased by almost an orderof magnitude.andP;  Moral: the faster the data rate on unshielded cable, the moresusceptible the cable is to noise and interference.andM;Other studies showed that when unshielded twisted-pair cable is used in anoffice environment, devices that use highly inductive swithching technologies(such as electric motors, fluorescent lights, typewriters, copiers, postalmachines and others) cause serious interference if the unshieldedtwisted-pair cable is within six feet of the device generating the signal.andO;If the signal exceeds 1 volt, the 6-foot distance from the noise sources isnot always sufficient to keep the interference from affecting the unshieldedtwisted-pair.andM;In addition, using unshielded twisted-pair cable at high frequencies willgenerate energy.andP;  The FCC and the equivalent authorities in other countrieshave announced some serious restrictions on radiation emissions above 30MHz.andO;This means that most unshielded twisted-pair installations may only be usedup to about 10Mpbs before the FCC regulation kicks in because 10Mbpssignaling requires over 20MHz to function.andP;  Higher rates than 10Mbps willrequire add-on filters or another cable technology to solve the need forhigher data rates.andM;An obvious, but resisted answer (no pun intended) to these problems isshielded twisted-pair cable.andP;  When a shield is used on each wire of a pairand then the pair is twisted, interference is almost a thing of the past.andP;  Intests, shielded twisted-pair cables have demonstrated very little, if any,interference from the same sources that cause interference on unshieldedtwisted-pair and do not exceed the radiation emission requirements of theFCC; estimates have shown that shielded twisted-pair can achieve rates over50 times 10Mbps and still not exceed FCC radiation restrictions.andP;  Shieldedtwisted-pair, however, does impose a penalty: shielding causes a capacitanceproblem that translates to shorter allowable cable runs than unshieldedtwisted-pair.andM;What does all of this mean to the average network installation?andP;  Plenty.andO;Long-term networks will require speeds that far exceed 10Mbps, and unless FCCregulations are modified, unshielded twisted-pair will restrict cable speedsto those currently proposed.andP;  A longer-term solution is to run shieldedcable, but the current draft of the 10Base-T standard does not provide forthat type of cable.andM;Also, distance limitations imposed by shielded cable may cause problems atsome sites.andP;  There are many sites that are planning to use existingunshielded twisted-pair as 802.3 10Base-T media in the future.andP;  Here are someitems that bear consideration:andM;* Ten milliseconds (ms) of noise at 9.6Kbits per second (Kbps) is a lotdifferent than 10ms of noise at 10Mbps.andP;  The faster the transmission, themore important it is to install cable away from electrical interference andother potential noise hazards.andM;* Punchdown blocks, connectors and other required connection points mayintroduce noise into the network.andP;  Recently, a twisted-pair repeater hub thathad two open sockets for connection to segments of twisted-pair caused allsegments off the hub to have noise and distortion problems.andP;  Putting dummyterminators in the open RJ11 sockets of the hub solved the problems.andP;  Thevendor informed the customer this was not necessary, but analysis of thecable showed that it was and did correct the problem.andM;* Shielded cable is not standard, but is beneficial and a long-term solution.andO;Many sites are using such cable, frequently referred to as IBM Type 1 cable,but shorter lengths of twisted-pair require more careful layout of runs andmore hub locations.andP;  This causes the expense to increase not only in calbecost, but also in the number of interconnects.andM;* Shielded twisted-pair cable may be used with many different types ofnetworks such as CSMA/CD (Ethernet as well), token-ring, Arcnet and others.andO;Not all networks support unshielded twisted-pair as a valid cable media type.andM;* Because of the small amount of connectable metal in twisted-pairconnectors, they are highly susceptible to corrosion in environmentally harshsituations.andP;  One of my customer sites had installed a twisted-pair networkand was using RJ11 (4-wire phone plug) connectors.andP;  Because the facility useschlorine and other volatile gases and is located in a marshy area, theconnectors cause noise to be introduced into the network, fail regularly andrequire frequent replacement.andM;The section of network next to one of the twisted-pair configuration iscomposed of ThinWire and has not had one cable fault in four years.andP;  Thetwisted-pair is 2 years old and has required more than 30 repairs in the last18 months.andP;  Twisted-pair is definitely not for all environments.andM;Oddly enough, one of the bigger proponents of unshielded twisted-pair, DEC,carefully states in practically every document concerning 802.3 twisted-pairnetworking that &quot;ThinWire is the optimal media to deliver 802.3/Ethernet tothe desktop.&quot;andM;Then again, maybe that is not so odd considering that ThinWire (RG58A/Ucoaxial), when properly installed, is practically immune to noise and doesnot exceed current or expected future FCC requirements.andM;Many of the solutions on the market for unshielded twisted-pair802.3/Ethernet do not meet the 10Base-T standard, for various reasons.andP;  Aboutthe only thing in common with 10Base-T is the cable type that is usuallyused.andP;  Variances in connectors, signaling rates, peak-to-peak voltages, andother critical components can prevent supposedly standardized components fromcommunicating.andP;  Sites that are not 10Base-T--compliant already should becomeso after ratification of the standard, to avoid an endless nightmare ofincompatible connections and vendor restrictions.andM;Some advice I have had for my customers is to buy twisted-pair solutions fromreputable vendors but only under the proviso that the vendor will retrofitall requisite components to meet, exactly and in all detail, the 10Base-Tstandard when it is finalized later this year.andP;  Although this may seemextreme, the variances between the current implementations and the finalized10Base-T do not imply that they cannto talk--many vendors will come up withconnection mechanisms.andP;  It does mean, however, that existing equipment mayrequire serious connection or electrical conversions that could easily causea configuration fiasco as the network grows.andP;  If everything connects the sameway and meets the standard, the possibility of such a disaster is lessened.andM;When considering the use of twisted-pair as a cabling standard or for a &quot;onecable fits all&quot; situation, unshielded twisted-pair is fine if there is noexpectation to exceed about 10Mbps.andP;  If, however, a truly long-term solutionis required and minimal noise aggravation is sought, shielded twisted-pair isthe way to go.andM;In both situations, proper analysis of network longevity and needs arerequired before the cable decision can be made.andP;  This means that a propernetwork design, with all the bells and whistles, is necessary to ensure thatthe proper solution is selected and implemented successfully.andP;  Without suchforethought, one can easily discover that twisted-pair also makes a greatnoose.andM;Bill Hancock is vice president of engineering at Essential Resources Inc., aNew York City-based training and consulting company specializing in VAXsystems.andP;  He is also a member of the DECUS board of directors.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
