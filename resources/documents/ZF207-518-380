 400 onReader Service CardandM;The heat is on in the workstation market.andP;  On the low end, the$1,000-per-MVUP mark has been shattered, and the image of sharks in a feedingfrenzy is all too real.andP;  Even on the rarefied high end, an increasing numberof buyers are willing to spend a small fortune for super-high-performance,3-D graphics workstations with the requisite CPU power.andM;To satisfy the appetities of these demanding 3-D users, Silicon Graphics hasdeveloped its Power Series of 3-D graphics workstations.andP;  These machines cansupport as many as eight Mips R3000 RISC CPUs, each with its own R3010floating-point unit (FPU), and all running in parallel.andM;Better yet, on DR Labs' CPU 2 benchmark tests, the Power Series 4D/240offered excellent performance.andP;  And with Silicon Graphics' Power FortranAccelerator, users can begin to benefit from parallel processing immediatelyand automatically, as DR Labs' CPU 2 benchmark results prove.andM;LOOKING INandM;The power Series is binary-compatible with all other members of SiliconGraphics' 4D line of workstations, including the uniprocessor Personal Iris,(For DR Labs' review of the Personal Iris, see &quot;A 3-D Home Run,&quot; DigitalReview, May 8, page 43.)andM;Whereas the Personal Iris contains just one Mips R2000 RISC CPU (and anoptional R2010 FPU) running at a clock rate of 12.5MHz.andP;  the Power Series canbe configured with as many as eight R3000 CPUs and associated R3010 FPUs.andM;The Power Series is offered in two families: the Power Station, with operatesas a computational server for other nodes on a network, and the  Power Iris,which has Silicon Graphics' GTX graphics processor and 3-D display.andM;Both families have four basic configurations: The 4D/120, with two 16.7MHzR2000/R2010 (CPU/FPU) chip sets: the 4D/220, with two 25MHz R3000/R3010 chipsets: the 4D/240, with four 25MHz R3000/R3010 chip sets: and the 4D/280, witheight 25MHz R3000/R3010 chip sets.andP;  (The 4D/280 was announced by SiliconGraphics last month.)andM;Power Station systems are identified by an S suffix in their names (forexample, the 4D/240S), and Power Iris machines have a GTX suffix (forexample, the 4D/240GTX).andM;Each member of the Power Series is housed in a single, large, desk-sideenclosure that measures 26 inches by 26 inches by 27 inches and can beconfigured with as much as 128MB of main memory and with drives offering from170MB to 9.6GB of disk space.andP;  Unlike many smaller workstations we've seen inthe past, the system's internal fans seemed loud.andM;There are two graphics systems available for the Power Iris: the GTX and theGTXB.andP;  The GTX graphics subsystem can support 48 bit planes for color imagesand 16 bit planes for alphanumeric displays, and it has a 24-bit-planeZ-buffer.andP;  The less-expensive GTXB does not include the 16 bit planes ofalpha.andP;  The graphics subsystem can access a palette of 16.7 million colors inRGB mode.andP;  The resolution of the standard 19-inch monitor is 1,280 by 1,024pixels.andM;The Power Iris supports four different color specification display modes:color index lookup mode.andP;  RGB mode, double-buttered color index mode anddouble-buffered RGB mode.andM;Like the Personal iris, the Power Iris provides many advanced graphicsfeatures in its hardware.andP;  This hardware support includes alpha-blending fortransparency: as many as eight colored light sources: ambient, specular anddiffuse lighting models: pan and zoom capabilitis: Gouraud and flat polygonshading; and anti-aliased lines to improve the perceived resolution.andM;Power Series CPU operate in a symmetrical, shared-memory multiprocessorconfiguration.andP;  This means that all of the CPUs can perform any operatingsystem kernel function, share the same process memory structures and performI/O to the graphics and peripheral buses.andM;The three major buses that connect all elements of the CPU subsystem are theSync.andP;  Processor and MPlink buses (Fig.andP;  1).andM;The Syne Bus synchronizes all processors so that they can process jobs inparallel.andP;  It provides 65,000 &quot;test-and-set&quot; variables that can be mappedinto the virtual address space of applications.andP;  It also allows distributionof interrupts between the processors and from the I/O subsystem to the CPUs.andM;Two major methods are used to provide low-level parallel synchronization:spinlocks and semaphores.andP;  With spinlocks, which are supported in the PowerSeries' hardware, a processor will perform a wait loop for a short period oftime on the single bit representing the data resource.andP;  For a resource thatwill be locked for a longer period, the Power Series uses semaphores, whichallow a compute process to be queued for access once the locked resource isunlocked.andM;Each CPU subsystem has its own Processor Bus, which is an address and databus that connects each individual CPU/FPU combination with the subsystem'sinstruction cache and a first-level data cache.andP;  Both caches hold 64KB andcontain physical memory addresses instead of virtual memory addresses.andO;Silicon Graphics rates the maximum aggregate throughput of the four Processorbuses in a four-processor Power Series system at 800MB per second.andM;DUAL CACHEandM;To help provide data to the CPU, Silicon Graphics has a second-level datacache of 256KB connected to the first-level data cache.andP;  This cache alsocontains physical memory addresses, so no physical-to-virtual addresstranslations are required.andM;The 64MB-per-second MPlink Bus connects the data caches of each CPU subsystemwith main memory, the graphics subsystem and the peripheral bus interfaces.andO;The MPlink Bus is used to ensure cache consistency among all of theprocessors.andM;Power Series systems support three independently controlled peripheral buses:VME, SCSI and Ethernet.andP;  The Power Series' VME bus supports double- andtriple-height Eurocard VME cards.andM;The software windowing system of the Power Iris, 4Sight, is identical to thatused in the Personal Iris and other members of Silicon Graphics' 4D series.andO;4Sight uses a client/server, window-manager approach that allows graphicsprograms to call system service routines from servers that reside either onthe local node or on a remote node.andM;The graphics client or application programs can be written to make calls toSilicon Graphics' properietary Graphics Library or Distributed GraphicsLibrary (DGL) or to PostScript.andP;  The servers are implemented when usingeither DGL or Sun's Network-extensible Window System (NeWS).andM;The last major component of the software display system is the Iris WindowManager, also known as Max, which is implemented in NeWS.andP;  The PostScriptroutines in Max specify the functionality as well as the appearance of thevarious screen displays--such as icons, menus and windows.andP;  Users can addtheir own custom menus to the display by writing PostScript programs.andM;Silicon Graphics' Irix operating system is based on Unix System V release 3and includes the TCP/IP networking software component from Berkeley 4.3BSDUnix.andP;  The operating system also contains a modified file system, called theExtent File System (EFS), and supports NFS as an optional product.andM;The multithreaded Iris kernel in Silicon Graphics' Power Series machinespermits multiple processes to be running in Unix user and system spacesimultaneously on all of the available processors.andM;Like the other parallel processing and multiprocessing systems that DR Labshas tested, the Irix operating system is built around a single queue forprocesses.andP;  As each processor in the system becomes available, it searchesthe run queue and starts computation on the first process in the queue.andM;Irix supports the C, Fortran-77 (with VMS extensions), Pascal, Ada and PL/1programming languages.andM;Programmers who want to make full use of the hardware will want toinvestigate Silicon Graphics' Power Fortran Accelerator.andP;  This precompiler islayered on top of Silicon Graphics' Fortran-77 compiler and performs dataflow analysis on a user's original source code.andP;  It then produces a listingfile detailing its attempts at parallelization, and a new source code filecombining the user's original source code with its own parallelizing codestatements (Fig.andP;  2).andM;At present, Fortran is the only language on Power Series machines for whichautomatic parallelization (via the Power Fortran Accelerator) is available.andO;Although other languages on the Iris can call parallel routines, programmershave to determine where to put those calls manually.andM;We used the Power Fortran Accelerator to parallelize DR Labs' CPU 2 benchmarksuite and then compiled it using the Power Fortran compiler on afour-processor Power Iris 4D/240.andM;Users do not have to recompile their programs to use them on other PowerSeries machines with more or fewer CPUs; compiled programs will automaticallyuse--in parallel--however many CPUs are available.andM;Silicon Graphics has added the mpadmin command to its Irix operating systemto explicitly enable or disable a given CPU in the system.andP;  For example, thecommand mpadmin enable 2 would allow a second processor to begin working inparallel with the first one.andP;  Any individual processor can be inserted orremoved from the CPU pool.andM;In executing DR Labs' CPU 2 benchmark suite, the Power Iris--with oneprocessor enabled--achieved a geometric mean time of 4.0 seconds for each ofthe suite's kernels, for a rating of 20.16 MicroVAX II units of processing(MVUPs) (Fig.andP;  3).andM;That compares very favorably with the last R3000/R3010-based machine that wetested, the Mips M/2000 compute server, which achieved 20.87 MVUPs.andP;  The HP9000 Model 835 3-D workstation achieved 11.62 MVUPs using the same benchmarkprogram, and the Silicon Graphics Personal Iris achieved 8.35 MVUPs.andM;Next we enabled the second processor with the mpadmin command.andP;  With two CPUsworking on the same benchmark suite, the Power Iris achieved 24.81 MVUPs.andO;Adding the third processor increased the MVUP rating to 27.10, and adding thefourth processor brought the MVUP rating up to 29.35 MVUPs.andM;The MVUP ratings given here are based on a revised value for DR Labs'standard of 1 MVUP.andP;  The new value comes from compiling DR Labs' CPU 2benchmark suite with VMS Fortran version 5.0 before we run it on a MicroVAXII.andP;  Because the new compiler yields slightly better execution times, thevalue of 1 MVUP is slightly higher.andM;We then examined the Power Iris' performance in parallel processing bymeasuring the geometric mean time it took to execute the kernels of CPU 2(T[is approx.]m) as a function of the number of processors being used (P).andO;These results proved to follow the relation T[is approx.].sub.m = 2.41 +1.62/P where 2.41 seconds represents the minimum execution time the compilerand CPUs can theoretically obtain, and the coefficient of 1/P, 1.62, measureshow fast this lower limit is approached as more processors are added.andP;  Thesmaller the coefficient is, the better (Fig.andP;  4).andM;THE BOTTOM LINEandM;The list price of a Power Iris 4D/240 with a GTXB subsystem, 8MB of memory, a170MB disk drive and an Ethernet controller is $144,900.andP;  The same systemwith the GTX subsystem is $154,000.andP;  The Power Station 4D/240S server withthe same memory, drive and Ethernet options is $104,900.andM;The Power Iris 4D/220 with a GTXB graphics subsystem, 8MB of memory, a 170MBdisk drive and Ethernet controller is priced at $114,900.andP;  The GTX version ofthat system is $124,900, and the 4D/220S is $74,900.andM;The upgrade price of turning a two-processor 4D/220 into a four-processor4D/240 is $30,000.andM;The Fortran compiler is priced at $500, and the Power Fortran Accelerator ispriced at $5,000.andM;Surveying the results of the benchmarks, we see that Silicon Graphics' PowerIris series' performance tops that of all other 3-D machines that DR Labs hastested.andP;  The innovative parallel processing nature of these systems adds totheir usefulness for programmers and for applications that can take fulladvantage of multiple processors.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
