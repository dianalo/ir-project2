The Communist Party's top newspaper blasted ``nationalisthysteria'' in the Baltic region and blamed a law passed by Estonia'sSupreme Soviet parliament for igniting labor unrest among ethnicRussians and other non-Estonians in the republic.   Izvestia, the Soviet government daily, reported that the workers'protest, in its seventh day, has shut down another mine in Estonia,and that railway employees walked off the job at a station atYulemiste.   That means all rail freight stations around Tallinn, Estonia'scapital, have been paralyzed by the strike, with more than 3,000rail cars standing idle, Izvestia said.   To assure the flow of supplies to the city of 480,000 people,goods are being shipped to other cities in Estonia, the paper quotedthe republic's deputy premier, P. Palu, as saying. ``That way, we'llsupply Tallinn with everything needed,'' he said.   Maarika Saarna, an editor with Estonian state radio, said fromTallinn that at last report, 26,000 workers at about 40 enterprisesin the republic of 1.5 million people were believed to be on strike.   Mikhail Lysenko, a member of the strike committee, said bytelephone that ``thousands'' of ethnic Russians at some 50 factorieswere staying off the job.   The strike began one day after Estonia's lawmakers adopted a lawlimiting voting to adults who have lived in the same district fortwo years, or anywhere in Estonia for five years. Candidates forelected office must live in the same place for five years, or inEstonia for 10 years.   State-run Radio Moscow said the law will take the right to voteaway from more than 100,000 recent non-Estonian arrivals _ theprecise goal pursued by the law's advocates, who fear an influx ofoutsiders will make ethnic Estonians a minority in their ownhomeland.   In its tough commentary, Pravda aimed its criticism at the lawrather than the strikers, saying ``the passage of discriminatoryacts has an extremely destabilizing influence on the politicalsituation.'' In Estonia and its two Baltic neighbors, Latvia andLithuania, ``a situation is building up of nationalist hysteria,''the paper said.   On Monday, Estonia's Communist Party chief Vaino Vyalyas calledfor ethnic Russians to negotiate their differences with therepublic's authorities and end the strike, which Radio Moscow saidhas cost the Soviet economy millions of dollars.   However, Vyalyas said in an Estonian TV interview that an initialround of negotations with protesting workers Monday did not succeedin resolving the strike, and called for more.   He admitted the rights of Estonia's minorities had not been takeninto account, and added ``this is our mistake and it must berectified.'' Russians and other migrants make up about one-third ofEstonia's population.   Ms. Saarna said two sets of negotiations were taking placeTuesday in Tallinn, at the Estonian party's policy-making CentralCommittee and with members of the Moscow-based Supreme Sovietlegislature's commission on interethnic relations, who flew toTallinn to try to calm tempers and end the strike.   Ms. Saarna, an ethnic Estonian, defended the new election lawfrom criticisms published by Pravda and in other Moscow-based media.``They forget every civilized country has a citizenship,'' she said.``We are fighting for staying alive as a nation. They act as thoughthe poor Russians only had this place (Estonia) to live in.''   In the Caucasus republics of Georgia and Azerbaijan _ two otherSoviet areas threatened by nationalist labor unrest _ officials saidall was quiet Tuesday.   Georgian activists called off a strike they had considered forTuesday, according to Gruzinform, the official Georgian news agency.An activist said the strike was postponed until Sept. 1 because thegovernment promised it will identify and take action againstinstigators of violence in one district of the republic, Abkhazia,by then.   At least 20 people died in the violence last month. Finding andpunishing those responsible has been the Georgian activists' maindemand.   In Azerbaijan, where six factories in the capital of Baku werereported on strike Monday and 10,000 people demonstrated Mondaynight, an Interior Ministry official said life was back to normalTuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
