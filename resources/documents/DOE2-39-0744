Abundances of C, N, Fe and other heavy elements have beendetermined by fitting synthetic spectra, calculated from model atmospheres,to the observational data. NGC 288 and 362 have very similar C + N +O and heavy-element abundances, indicating that another parameter isneeded to account for their different horizontal-branch morphologies.</TEXT></DOC>
