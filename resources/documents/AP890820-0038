The one-stage, 47-foot-tall TR-1 No. 3 test rocket lifted off at8 a.m. (7 p.m. EDT Saturday) from Tanegashima island, officials ofthe National Space Development Agency of Japan.   Kyodo News Service reported the launch was mainly aimed atchecking air resistance and vibration as the rocket flies in theatmosphere.   It said the TR-1 project, begun last year, will develop the newH-2 rocket by using data gathered by a series of test launches.   The H-2 is designed to increase the number of satellite launchesat a lower cost, the space agency said.
