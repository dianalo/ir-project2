But trading was light because of nervousness about a government report this morning on the nation's foreign-trade performance during March. Prices of some long-term Treasury bonds declined by about 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount.    The monthly trade figures command closer attention than any other government report. Last month's report showing an unexpectedly large $13.83 billion deficit in February triggered a sharp sell-off in both the dollar and Treasury bonds. The stock market reacted even more drastically that day, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 100 points.    Although U.S. government officials have said they expect the trade gap to narrow in coming months, many investment managers remain skeptical, fearing large deficits will depress the dollar and bonds further. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report generally expect today's report to show the March deficit narrowed to $12 billion to $13 billion.    The average estimate of the 16 economists polled showed a $12.6 billion gap. A deficit of more than $13 billion probably would cause the dollar to weaken, hurting bonds by raising inflation concerns, many analysts said.    The bond market &quot;is going to be in serious trouble&quot; if the March deficit turns out larger than February, said F. Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Even if the deficit shrank, bond traders may react negatively depending on how imports and exports behaved. A narrower gap might fuel inflation fears if interpreted as a sign of robust domestic economic growth.    &quot;If the number is really on the low side (and) if exports are strong, it could be taken that the economy is really moving,&quot; said Robert Dederick, chief economist of Northern Trust Co. &quot;The composition might be as important as anything else.&quot;    Toshiaki Kakimoto, chief economist at Sumitomo Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, expects the U.S. trade deficit to narrow &quot;very slowly&quot; over the long term. He also said in an interview in New York yesterday that he expects U.S. interest rates to be slightly higher by the end of this year.    For example, Mr. Kakimoto predicted that 30-year Treasury bond yields, now about 9 1/8%, will rise to about 9 1/2% by year end. He said sharply higher rates are unlikely because inflation is likely to remain &quot;moderate,&quot; because the dollar won't drop sharply further, and because the Federal Reserve Board won't make any significant or drastic credit-tightening moves.    The Fed is likely to continue &quot;fine-tuning&quot; policy, rather than taking &quot;drastic&quot; action, such as raising its discount rate, Mr. Kakimoto said. The discount rate, now 6%, is the fee it charges on loans to banks and savings institutions.    Yesterday's sharp jump in the Commodity Research Bureau's futures index came as prices of agricultural futures surged. The index closed at 241.89, up nearly three points. It is monitored by many bond traders as a leading indicator of inflation.    Treasury Securities   Several traders said they were surprised that bond prices didn't drop much more yesterday in view of the surge in commodity prices.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. declined only 0.72 point to 1228.66. It ranged between 1226.08 and 1232.64.    Among actively traded issues, the Treasury's new 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 were quoted late yesterday at 100 1/32 to yield 9.12%. That was down in price from 100 8/32 to yield 9.10% Friday.    The Treasury's new three-year notes were quoted late yesterday at a yield of 8.14%, up from 8.11% Friday. The yield on the new 10-year notes rose to 9.01% from 8.99% Friday.    Japanese investors bought large amounts of the 10-year and 30-year Treasury securities sold last week. Mr. Kakimoto of Sumitomo Bank estimates that Japanese investors bought &quot;at least 50%&quot; of the 30-year bonds sold Thursday and &quot;maybe 40%&quot; of the 10-year notes auctioned Wednesday.    Rates on short-term Treasury bills were unchanged or slightly higher than Friday. The government yesterday sold new bills at slightly lower rates than at last week's auction. The average rate on new 13-week bills dipped to 6.28% from 6.31%, while the average on new 26-week bills dipped to 6.50% from 6.51%.    Here are details:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                13-Week              26-Week Applications ........ $28,627,510,000      $25,157,355,000 Accepted bids ........ $6,431,485,000       $6,407,525,000 Accepted at low price  .......... 47%                  93% Accepted noncompet'ly  $1,051,925,000         $861,145,000 Average price (Rate)    98.413(6.28%)        96.714(6.50%) High price (Rate) ..... 98.415(6.27%)        96.734(6.46%) Low price (Rate) ...... 98.413(6.28%)        96.714(6.50%) Coupon equivalent ............. 6.47%                6.81%   Both issues are dated May 19. The 13-week bills mature Aug. 18, and the 26-week bills mature Nov. 17.   ---   Mortgage-Backed Securities   In the mortgage-backed securities market, prices of bellwether issues declined slightly in light activity. Ginnie Maes ended with losses of as much as 1/8 point, while Freddie Macs and Fannie Maes were down about 1/4 point.   The benchmark conventional issue, Freddie Mac 9 1/2% pass-through securities for June delivery, declined 1/4 point to 96 7/8 bid, yielding 9.97%. The Ginnie Mae 9% issue yields 10.05%. Both are based on a 12-year average life assumption.   The spread between the Freddie Mac issue and comparable Treasury notes as of yesterday afternoon had widened to 0.97 percentage point from 0.95 percentage point Friday. But the spread to the Ginnie Mae 9% issue was one basis point tighter than on Friday at 1.05 percentage point.   Mortgages   Home mortgage rates rose again last week, and some mortgage bankers expect further increases through the end of this year.   The national average for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages climbed to 10.51% from 10.44% the previous week, according to a survey by HSH Associates, a Riverdale, N.J., publisher of mortgage market information. The national average for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages rose to 10.15% from 10.08%.   John Teutsch, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, said it is apparent that &quot;we have clearly reached a trough in rates.&quot;   The group said fixed-rate mortgages accounted for more than 73% of loans made in early May, compared with 81% in March, showing a gain in market share for adjustable-rate lending. The adjustable-rate mortgage share rose to 23.4% in early May from 15.4% in March, the association said.   Municipals   Municipal bonds were narrowly mixed in the same listless trading activity that pervaded the rest of the bond markets.   The closely watched New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue due 2018 was quoted late yesterday at 89 1/4 bid on one major broker screen, down 1/8 from Friday's closing level.   Moody's Investors Service Inc. released a publication providing details on how it evaluates the claims-paying capacity of municipal bond insurers. Moody's now carries triple-A ratings on more than 9,000 municipal issues based on the claims-paying strength of Ambac Indemnity Corp., Bond Investors Guaranty Insurance Co., Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. and Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corp.   Corporate Issues   Corporate bond prices finished little changed to off 1/8 point in light trading.   On the new-issue front, $400 million of new issues was offered to investors. Two of the three issues had long maturities, and underwriters pricing those issues continued to use the old Treasury bonds, the 8 7/8% issue due 2017, as a pricing gauge. As of late yesterday, the issue yielded about 9.20%.   Underwriters have been reluctant to use the new Treasury bellwether, the 9 1/8% issue due 2018, because they don't feel it adequately reflects the yield level of long-term Treasury securities yet.   The largest offering was a three-part, $200 million financing by Cajun Electric Power Cooperative Inc. W.R. Berkley Corp. sold $100 million of 20-year debentures and Kimberly-Clark Corp. sold $100 million of three-year notes.   Foreign Bonds   Trading activity yesterday was light ahead of today's U.S. trade data.   In Japan, prices of government bonds finished little changed in sluggish volume. In addition to nervousness about the U.S. trade data, market participants also are apprehensive about Japanese money supply data for April. Japan's benchmark 5% issue due November 1997 closed unchanged at a yield of 4.675%.   In West Germany, some late afternoon selling pushed mark bonds off their highs, leaving government bonds about 1/8 point higher on the day and Euromark bonds 1/4 point stronger.   In London, gilts rose early in the day in line with sterling's rally but later fell back on worries that base rates might be cut below their current 8% level. Long-term bonds, which gained 3/8 during the morning, ended unchanged, while shorter-dated bonds, which benefited from some switching out of longs, ended up 3/16.   &quot;The long end (of the market) would not be too happy with another rate cut,&quot; said one dealer, noting rumors of heavy selling as sterling rose over the 3.19 mark level and prompted reported intervention by the Bank of England. Analysts widely expect base rates to be cut to 7 1/2% if the pound threatens the 3.20 mark level.   At the end of the day, the benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007 was unchanged at 118 30/32 to yield 9.35%. At the short end of the gilt market, the Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 1991 ended 6/32 higher at 106 20/32 to yield 8.87%, while the Treasury 12% issue due 1995 was up 6/32 at 112 28/32 to yield 9.36%.</TEXT></DOC>
