Canada Post, a government agency, has continued mail deliveries despite the five-day-old work stoppage. A union spokesman predicted the strike will cripple postal operations in a week. The union's technical members service mailsorting machines.    A federal government mediator, Mac Carson, said Friday that he wasn't able to get the two sides to resolve their differences. The main unresolved issue is a union demand for a reduction to 37 1/2 hours from 40 hours in the workweek of the union's technical members. </TEXT></DOC>
