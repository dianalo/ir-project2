In the occupied territories, an alleged Palestinian collaboratorwas killed, reportedly by other Arabs, and 10 Palestinians werereported wounded in clashes with Israeli troops.   Shamir told representataives of the European Parliament thatIsrael would accept U.N. involvement in Middle East peacenegotiations. The Parliament has been pressing Israel to negotiatewith the PLO.   Shamir said any peace talks must be held directly with Arabparties to the conflict and ruled out the Palestine LiberationOrganization's sitting at the bargaining table.   ``Such negotiations can be launched under the auspices of thegreat powers (the United States and the Soviet Union) or the UnitedNations, providing they refrain from any involvement in thesubstance of the talks,'' Shamir said.   Shamir has contended until now that a U.N.-sponsored forum wouldbe biased against Israel and force concessions from the Jewish state.   The Arab states want an international conference attended by thefive permanent Security Council members _ the United States, theSoviet Union, China, Britain and France _ who would play an activerole in negotiations.   European Parliament Speaker Lord Plumb addressed Israel'sParliament after Shamir's statement, saying the European Communitysupported an international conference under U.N. auspices with thePLO as a negotiating partner.   He said European Community members also believe the conflictcould not be resolved unless Israel withdrew from the occupiedterritories and recognized the Palestinians' right toself-determination.   ``It is clear that without the recognition of the legitimaterights of the Palestinians there cannot be any prospect of a durablepeace for any country in the region,'' Plumb said.   Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank, meanwhile, appeared toadopt the tactics used by Palestinian protesters and declared aone-day general strike in at least 32 settlements for Thursday.   Their leaders said the strike was to protest the death of threeIsraelis in the West Bank last month and Palestinian stone-throwingattacks.   At least 10 Palestinians were shot and wounded Tuesday in clasheswith Israeli soldiers in a half dozen towns and refugee camps in theoccupied territories, Arab reports and hospital officials said.   Arab hospital officials said a 12-year-old girl was shot in thehead and wounded during a confrontation between troops andstone-throwing youths in Shati refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.   They said a 17-year-old youth was shot in the head with a rubberbullet in another Gaza refugee camp and a 23-year-old man was hit inthe chest with a live round in the West Bank village of Beit Lit.   The army confirmed nine wounded and said they included a girlfrom Shati taken in serious condition to an Israeli hospital.   Arab reporters said Palestinians who collaborate with Israeliauthorities shot and killed a 27-year-old man in the West Bankvillage of Idna Monday night after he refused to feed theminformation.   An Arab reporter quoted family members as saying the victim,Kayed Muhammad Tmaizi, acted as an informant for Israeli securityforces until the Palestinian uprising began. They said he recentlywas pressured to renew his cooperation.   An army official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmedTmaizi's death and maintained Tmaizi was killed in a dispute amongPalestinians. He did not elaborate.   The death brought to 349 the number of Palestinians killed in theuprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.Fifteen Israelis also have died since the uprising began Dec. 8,1987.   Shamir and the European delegates exchanged sharp words Tuesdayabout Israel's peace stance and a possible European role in theMideast conflict.   Shamir accused the European Community of ``adopting positions onthe substantive issues of the conflict ... which lack balance,supporting the PLO and accepting the concept of a Palestinianstate.''   Marco Pannella of Italy accused Shamir of refusing to makeconcessions to the Palestinians. ``We're beginning to get fed upwith the fact that when you talk about peace, you do so in verybellicose tones,'' he said.   ``Continuing in this way, you'll be a kind of dinosaur head ofthis very monolithic state of intolerance,'' Pannella said.</TEXT></DOC>
