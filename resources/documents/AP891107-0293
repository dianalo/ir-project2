The justices, by an 8-1 vote, allowed an Illinois insurancecompany to go to federal court to challenge a worker compensationaward to a Texas man.   The court said insurers may sue in federal court even though theemployer they insure is based in the same state as the injuredworker _ as long as the insurance company is from another statethan the opposing side.   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the court, said federallaw bars such federal lawsuits when insurance companies are sued.   But the law clearly does not apply when the insurance companiesare doing the suing, Marshall said.   The distinction may seem incongruous, Marshall said. But, headded, ``We cannot doubt that Congress meant what it said.''   The case stems from a compensation claim awarded Larry W. Brewerfor an injury he suffered on April 4, 1986, while working forWhitmire Line Clearance Inc. in Lamar County, Texas.   Legal papers submitted to the high court did not describeBrewer's job, his injuries or the size of the compensation award.   Northbrook National Insurance Co., based in Illinois, insuresWhitmire for worker compensation claims. The insurance firm went tofederal court in 1987 to challenge the award to Brewer made by theTexas Industrial Accident Board.   A federal judge threw out the insurer's suit and the ruling wasupheld by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.   At issue was a doctrine called ``diversity jurisdiction'' whichgives federal courts authority to rule on civil disputes when theopposing sides are from different states.   Justice John Paul Stevens, in a lone dissent, said workercompensation is primarily a matter of local interest with whichfederal courts ``have only minimal contact.''   The case is Northbrook vs. Brewer, 88-995.</TEXT></DOC>
