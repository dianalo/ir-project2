The 39 countries in Africa face the need to expand schools thatcan teach 51 million children to take care of nearly 91 million bythe year 2000.   The resources available have been stretched thinner as thepopulation soared. Per pupil spending, after discounting forinflation, fell from $67 a year in 1970 to $48 in 1983, the reportsaid. In many countries people's average incomes also are declining.   In four countries _ Somalia, Togo, Mozambique and Angola _ thenumber of youngsters registering for school actually went down evenas population figures raced ahead.   Overall, one child in four in sub-Saharan Africa is not enrolledin school at all, and the ranks are growing.   In the United States, spending on elementary and secondaryschools averages more than $4,000 per pupil each year. The schoolsspend almost as much on each student in two class days as theseAfrican countries spend in an entire year.   The bank is the biggest single source of aid to help Third Worldcountries raise their living standards. Its report says donorsshould get together and help more.   A child reaching school age in Somalia, at the northeastern tipof the continent, had about one chance in six of finding a teacherin 1983.   The number of high school students there has risen, but in 1983there were still only about 63,000 in a population of 5 or 6million.   The report says, ``Africa's explosive population growth greatlyincreases the number of children seeking access to schools andincreases the number of potential illiterates.   ``The stock of human capital in Africa will determine whetherAfricans can harness the universal explosion of scientific andtechnical knowledge for the region's benefit _ or whether Africawill fall farther and farther behind the world's industrialnations.''   Peter R. Moock, who led the team that compiled the study, saidin an interview that Somalia is an extreme case. According to thereport, fewer than 12 percent of adult Somalis could read in 1983.Primary school teachers were paid $985 a year. The government wasspending about 6 percent of its budget on education _ less than $21million _ and that share had been dropping for years.   By comparison, it spent $114 million for its military, a figurethat rose to $134 million in 1985.   Across Africa, the number of students of all ages quintupledbetween 1960 and 1983. The report said that in 19 of the 39countries, the primary-school age population, six to 11, wasgrowing faster than the number of children entering school.   In 13 countries _ including Nigeria, the most populous on thecontinent _ a smaller proportion was enrolled in primary schools in1983 than in 1980.   ``In many respects, 1983 was the worst year of the economiccrisis, and it is possible that a number of educational indicatorshave subsequently begun to improve,'' the report notes.   It says improving education would pay off, even from a purelymaterial point of view.   ``Farmers who have completed four years of education produce, onaverage, about 8 percent more farm output than farmers who have notgone to school,'' the report says.   It quotes other studies as showing that babies are more likelyto survive if their mother has at least a few years of education.Educated people are more likely to be mobile, moving from lessproductive jobs to better ones and sending money back home whenthey migrate. They are also likely to be healthier, and to livelonger.   The report's recommendations include:   _ More spending on education by African countries themselves,with emphasis on books and materials, new methods such as radiobroadcasts and correspondence schools.   _ Improvement of school principals, with more autonomy andbetter achievement testing.   _ More foreign aid, and better coordination, with a largerproportion for primary schools, less for higher education andoverseas fellowships.</TEXT></DOC>
