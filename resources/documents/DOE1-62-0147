No provisions are foreseen for defense against bombers andcruise missiles that could deliver nuclear weapons against U.S. targetsor against clandestine introduction of nuclear explosives on ships oreven trucks or cars into this country as do thousands of tons of narcoticsevery year. Therefore, even if the Strategic Defense Initiative werecompletely successful, the country would still remain woefully vulnerableto nuclear attack. A more realistic goal which, however, contradictsMr. Reagan's call for a perfect defense, is promoted in the papers issuedby the White House and by General James Abrahamson. These statementswhich go from one end of the spectrum to the other are terribly confusing.In this paper the author tries to bring to bear on these conflictingviews whatever general considerations physics and common sense affordus in order to decide which of the above statements will prove to comeclosest to the pragmatic truth in the years to come.</TEXT></DOC>
