(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge's ruling in a divorce custodybattle over seven frozen human embryos that life begins atconception has inflamed the debate on when life starts.   Abortion foes took heart at the Tennessee ruling Thursday thatcustody of the embryos could be awarded as if they were children.   Regina Smith, executive director of the Pro-Life Council ofConnecticut, called the court's decision ``a victory for unbornchildren.''   ``This ruling reflects what pro-lifers have been saying for years_ that life begins at conception and should be protected by the lawsof our land,'' Ms. Smith said.   But those who support a woman's right to have an abortion calledthe decision wrong-headed and found it at odds with the U.S. SupremeCourt decision in Roe vs. Wade that legalized abortion.   ``That may be the personal view of this particular judge, but ithas no basis in law,'' said Kate Michelman, executive director ofthe National Abortion Rights Action League in Washington. ``It alsohas dangerous implications for reproductive freedom in America.''   Blount County Circuit Judge W. Dale Young awarded temporarycustody of the embryos to Mary Sue Davis, who wants them implantedin her so she can bear a child. The judge rejected the arguments ofher estranged husband, Junior Lewis Davis, who sued for divorce andsought an order preventing implantation.   Child support, visitation and final custody will be decided if abirth results, the judge wrote.   Davis, 31, vowed to appeal to the Tennessee Court of Appeals.   ``They are going to force me to become a father against mywishes,'' he said.   Mrs. Davis, 29, who now lives near Titusville, Fla., said shewould wait to try to get pregnant until appeals were over. She saidthe earliest she would try would be in January.   Charles Clifford, the husband's attorney, said he believed thiswas the first time a judge declared an embryo a human being. He saidthe ruling conflicts with the Roe vs. Wade decision, which said thata fetus in the early stages of development lacks legal rights.   The Roe decision ``contains some explicit language that says thata fetus, which of course is much further along than an embryo, isnot a human being for the purposes of the United StatesConstitution,'' Clifford said.   The judge said he believed Roe vs. Wade didn't apply to the Daviscase because it dealt with the constitutionality of abortion, notconception.   ``From fertilization, the cells of a human embryo aredifferentiated, unique and specialized to the highest degree ofdistinction,'' the judge said. Thus, he said, ``Human life begins atconception.''   Hedy Weinberg, executive director of the Tennessee American CivilLiberties Union, said there is no consensus among doctors andscientists supporting the judge's conclusion.   ``There is no question that while some people believe that lifebegins at conception, that is based on religious belief,'' Weinbergsaid.   The case grew out of the decade-old technology of ``test-tubebabies,'' or in-vitro fertilization. Eggs extracted surgically froma woman are fertilized in a laboratory dish and then can beimplanted back in the woman.   The couple produced nine embryos in December with the help of Dr.I. Ray King at a Knoxville clinic. Two were implanted in Mrs. Davisbut failed to develop. The others were put in cold storage. Davissued for divorce in February.   After declaring the four- to eight-cell embryos to be childrenrather than property, Young in effect treated the case like atypical custody dispute, in which the overriding concern is the bestinterest of the child.   The Davises' divorce is not yet final. In his ruling, Younginstructed Mrs. Davis' attorney to file final papers that wouldcomplete the proceeding. Other issues, like the division ofhousehold property, were uncontested.</TEXT></DOC>
