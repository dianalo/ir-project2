 For courseware,presentations and other information dissemination, users wantcomputing to develop in the direction of combining text, graphics,video, audio and animation.andP;  Practical applications are stillminimal because of the enormous amounts of computing power andstorage needed and the high costs involved, especially for thevideo portion.andP;  Most large-scale multimedia systems exist only onpaper or in prototype form.andP;  Smaller systems for use onmicrocomputers are in use, however.andP;  Multimedia applications existfor training repair technicians, individual demonstrations,interactive software for training of employees and educatingstudents as well as the more common business presentations.andO;Related applications include touch screens, one- and two-way videocommunications and imaging systems.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Multimedia technologyFuture of ComputingFuture TechnologiesApplicationsVideo SystemsIntegrated SoftwarePresentations.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>It's new.andP;  It's exciting.andP;  it's the future of personal computing.andP;  But what'sit for?andM;EVERY COMPUTER COMPANY seems to agree: multimedia computing will play a majorrole in the future of business.andP;  Just watch the videos they've created todepict their view of computing in the next century.andM;The scene: a 21st-century conference room in which a team of businessstrategists is reviewing sales performance.andP;  &quot;By the way,&quot; a manager at thetable asks,  how's Johnson doing with our new line in Brazil?&quot; The executivesturn to face a 5-foot-square pane of glass rising from the floor.andP;  The imageof Johnson's head appears on it, with the skyscrapers of Rio looming in thebackground.andP;  I've been working up those projections on Brazilian sales,&quot; saysthe head.andP;  Suddenly, a bar graph shoots to the screen, obscuring Johnson'sface momentarily before shrinking to a box on the lower right corner of theglass.andP;  Impressive work, Johnson,&quot; says the boss.andP;  &quot;But ...andP;  what if wechange the price from five to six?&quot; The glass listens and adjusts, the graphaccordingly, to the fiscal delight of the executives.andM;But,&quot; a flunky interjects, &quot;how can we justify such a price increase?&quot; Thecamera shifts across the table to the smirking face of a futuristicbrown-noser.andP;  Flunky,&quot; he asks, &quot;didn't you see this morning's video-maildump?&quot; Instantly, in a new window in another corner of the glass, videofootage of a recent newscast begins playing.andP;  Says the TV anchorperson: &quot;Nowmore than ever, Brazilians seem ready to pay six instead of Eve.&quot;andM;Great,&quot; shouts the boss, reaching for a cup of virtual coffee.andP;  &quot;Let's get onit now!&quot;andM;As you'd expect from anything that promises to Put the universe on yourdesktop, multimedia computing has created excitement.andP;  Lots of excitement.andO;The prospect of bringing photographs, recorded voice, music and video under acomputer's control has long made technology prophets drool.andP;  Computing inmultiple media--taking advantage of the unique message-carrying ability ofaudio, video, text and graphies--can, many believe, vastly expand theusefulness of computers as repositories and disseminators of information.andM;For now, however, the grandest visions for multimedia computing remain onlyvisions.andP;  Monumental projects abound, but most exist only on paper or are inthe infant stages of development.andM;Take the U.S.andP;  Department of Agriculture's  Whole Earth Decision SupportSYstem-&quot; A prototype of this PC-based public-access system can show a videoabout pruning Christmas trees, retrieve text about pesticides, runexpert-system software to calculate dairy herd production, deliver graphicson nutrition via CD-ROM and link to online databases.andP;  After three years ofdevelopment, however, a plan to place it in 3,000 offices has fallen short.andM;&quot;Right now,&quot; says a creator of the system, &quot;there's just one workstation.&quot;andM;&quot;So many of these projects are prototypes because everybody wants multimediato be these 10-gigabyte executive information systems,&quot; observes Marc Canter,founder of MacroMind, a San Francisco developer of multimedia software forcorporate presentations.andP;  &quot;Everyone wants multimedia to be everything.andP;  Bydefinition, that's gonna take a while.&quot;andM;But for those who will settle for less than everything, multimedia offerspossibilities today.andP;  PC hardware platforms are not only available but arebecoming more affordable.andP;  Software for building multimedia applicationskeeps improving.andP;  And real-life business applications that use parts oftoday's multimedia technologies are emerging.andP;  For instance, software canshow trainees how to repair a machine rather than merely describe theprocedure.andP;  PC-generated presentations can capture an audience's attentionwith video sequences and pulsating music.andP;  Inventory databases can includephotographs of merchandise to supplement product numbers.andM;&quot;You don't need the full-blown shuttle rocket with 15 boosters to takeadvantage of multimedia,&quot; says Rob Lippincott, director of businessdevelopment and coordinator of multimedia projects at the Lotus DevelopmentCorporation.andM;What's it All For?andM;To most people, the term multimedia brings to mind images of elaboratepresentations at museums or conferences, combining slides, film, voice-oversand swelling sound tracks to so overwhelm an audience that a point is made ora lesson taught.andP;  That idea hasn't changed.andP;  But bring a personal computerinto the act and you open new possibilities.andP;  For starters, you can put theshow on someone's desk, making it personal.andP;  Then add an element that's trulyuseful: interactivity.andP;  Unlike slide projectors, computers are designed toaccept input from a user, process it and return something different.andO;Personal interaction with media that aren't traditionally interactive(photographs, video, music, recorded voice) is what excites people aboutmultimedia computing.andM;Corporations are slowly starting to decide what to do with this new kind ofpersonal interaction.andP;  They're applying it to presentations, training videos,information dissemination and digital video communication as well as to suchconventional applications as word processing, spreadsheets and databases.andM;Presentation PunchandM;For example, computer-controlled video and music pay off in presentations,according to Canter.andP;  Face it,&quot; he says, &quot;the first thing you do when youmake a presentation is turn the lights off.andP;  What do people do? Snooze.andO;You've gotta use the media to slam on people's heads.&quot; Imagine, he suggests,contrasting your competitor's product with yours by accompanying the otherguy's stuff with screeching punk-rock music and yours with Mozart.andM;Of course, you can do this with traditional audiovisual litaire game forWindows is almost os equipment.andP;  But doing it on a microcomputer, Cantersays, is (a) cheaper and (b) easier to control at presentation time.andP;  Mostpresenters have confronted the nightmare of rushing through or skipping amongoverhead slides to meet time constraints or audience demands.andP;  Departing froma planned presentation sequence can be disastrous, especially if slides mustbe synchronized with audio.andP;  With a computer, such jumping around can be aseasy as pressing a few keys.andM;It proved invaluable for Lutheran Brotherhood, a Minneapolis-based insurancecompany with $7.6 billion in assets under management, which outfits its fieldsalespeople with portable multimedia presentations.andM;The company hired a consulting firm to develop its multimedia presentationusing IBM's Storyboard Plus Version 2.0.andP;  The goal was to have a portablepresentation with an easy-to-understand, scripted format that would bevisually engaging and give new salespeople, equipped with Toshiba 3100SXlaptops, a complete guide for presentations.andM;The resulting presentation uses graphics, animation and text to persuadepotential clients to buY life insurance, health insurance and mutual fundsfrom Lutheran Brotherhood.andP;  The prospective client can take over the keyboardand input data, responding to prompts about the size of his or her family,date of birth, non-smoker or smoker status and desired retirement date.andP;  Atthe end of the presentation, the computer generates an insurancerecommendation based on the client's responses.andM;Increased RetentionandM;&quot;Courseware&quot; has employed interactive video for almost a decade, and trainingprofessionals talk of how it boosts the learner's &quot;retention rate.&quot;andM;Study results tossed about by proponents of interactive video show thataudiences retain 20 percent of information they hear, 40 percent of what theysee, and 60 to 70 percent of information with which they interact.andM;It's difficult to put a hard value on higher retention rate (even if youbelieve in such studies), but one thing's for sure: U.S.andP;  companies spend alot of money on training and presentations, and PC-based multimedia can cutthose costs.andM;A 40-person department at Tandem Computers in Cupertino, California, trainsworkers to repair its multimillion-dollar machines for customers.andP;  Repairclasses used to cost the company $650 a day per person because traineesneeded hands-on experience with the costly Tandem machines, says DavidBailey, developer of Tandem's hardware-education courses.andM;As an alternative, the company took some pictures of equipment, recorded somecomputer sounds and used Authorware software to give trainees simulatedhands-on repair experience at their desktops.andP;  Imitation lights blink, diskdrives whir and fans blow while trainees make adjustments.andP;  The simulationsaves Tandem thousands of dollars daily, Bailey says, and is often aseffective as training on real equipment.andP;  Meanwhile, dollars saved are usedto justify more intensive training on topics that require the use of actualmachines.andM;Touch-Screen KiosksandM;Interactive multimedia is already widely used to disseminate information.andO;Advertising agency Ogilvy andamp; Mather has placed interactive kiosks in lobbiesat its New York City headquarters (the kiosks use IBM's PC-based InfoWindowsystem).andP;  Visitors, often prospective clients, use the touchscreen-driven&quot;Ogilvy On-Line&quot; to view the agency's latest commercials or seeblack-and-white footage of the agency's charismatic founder, David Ogilvy.andO;Another selection offers news highlights, which are downloaded daily bymodem.andP;  Also available are an employee directory and an illustrated lunchtime guide&quot; with the scoop on nearby restaurants and museums.andM;&quot;This is a corporate-culture machine,&quot; says Martin Nisenholtz, president ofthe Interactive Marketing Group of Ogilvy andamp; Mather's target-marketing arm,Sage.andP;  Ogilvy On-Line projects a leading-edge image.andP;  And in a business whereimage is everything, that's invaluable, he says.andM;Susan Kober, an information systems executive at Shell Canada in Calgary, hasput a slightly more tangible value on one of her corporation's multimediaefforts.andP;  Shell installed public-access kiosks around Calgary to educate andpacify citizens who live near potentially hazardous &quot;sour gas&quot; drillingsites.andP;  &quot;Our CEO estimated the soft-dollar benefits [from improved communityrelations] to be about $1 million,&quot; says Kober.andM;Communicating Via Video Digital video communication, for business andconsumer use, is a more generalized application, and one that multimediatechnology could facilitate.andM;One-way video could let on-line researchers download digitized pictures andsound in addition to text.andP;  The U.S.andP;  Videotex Industry Association this yearformed a work group to discuss standards for putting video in videotex.andM;Two-way, real-time video for communication is in use today, though in aprimitive form.andP;  Users expect it to combine a telephone's ease of use with atelevision's picture quality.andP;  It offers neither.andP;  Suppliers ofvideoconferencing gear still must advise conference participants to avoidunnecessary sound and movement--even to avoid bright clothing--to minimizethe amount of information that must be coded and transmitted.andP;  Multimediacomputing could create the need for better multimedia communications and giverise to technologies, such as improved digital compression, that would help.andM;Coming SoonandM;Of course, some say that multimedia is not just for applications that danceon the fringes of mainstream computing.andP;  They insist that the applicationsthat shaped personal computing-word processing, spreadsheets anddatabases--will absorb multimedia features.andM;It's not hard to imagine the need for pictures within databases that keeptrack of personnel, parts or products.andM;What else? Hewlett-Packard's NewWave allows the creation of &quot;compounddocuments&quot; that include text, video and sound.andP;  Its demonstration of a wordprocessing document that incorporates a video of a space-shuttle launch drawscrowds at trade shows.andP;  But the company admits that customers have yet tofigure out how to apply this capability.andM;Tony Maclaren, president of VideoLogic, suggests video- or voice-annotationof spreadsheets.andP;  A spreadsheet column that itemizes the costs of developinga property could be linked to a picture of the building or a spokenexplanation of the costs.andP;  This is technically possible.andP;  All thecapabilities of VideoLogic's video board, in fact, may be accessed withDOS-like commands, enabling any application program that issues DOS commands (including many spreadsheets and databases) to summon video images at anytime.andM;Of course, it raises the fundamental question of whether you want yourspreadsheet to gab at you.andP;  Spreadsheets work because they let numbers speakfor themselves.andP;  One plus one equals two is great.andP;  One plus one equals twoexcept, sir, that the one in the first row varies depending on numerous,hard-to-quantify factors&quot; stinks.andM;&quot;We don't have any customers asking us to put pictures in spreadsheet cells,&quot;says Lotus's Lippincott.andP;  He sees the most probable juncture of everyday PCapplications and multimedia in what he calls &quot;just-in-time&quot; learning--pop-up,context-sensitive audiovisual help-built into every new application.andP;  LotusMarketplace, a new CD-ROM-based marketing database for the Macintosh, ispackaged with just such materials.andM;Lippincott also foresees a  video user interface&quot; that will pick up wheregraphical user interfaces leave off.andP;  It's hard to say what form a VUI mighttake, he admits.andP;  One possibility might be Apple's fanciful &quot;KnowledgeNavigator&quot; concept, in which software agents&quot; that appear as friendly faceswork feverishly behind the scenes (as smart software) to manage multiplecomputing tasks.andM;Or multimedia might sneak through the back door into personal computing, muchas &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;--first overhyped and then shot down for its lackof applications-quietly seeped into such everyday software&quot; as scheduling andfinancial-modeling packages.andM;A Costly VentureandM;Nobody has ever said that multimedia computing is cheap.andP;  The cost ofbuilding applications varies wildly, but this fact remains: You can't hackmultimedia.andM;An end-user system must have a fast PC with at least VGA graphics, anexternal speaker (under $100) and a CD-ROM drive or industrial-type videodiscplayer, plus the  2,000-range boards that digitize NTSC video signals.andM;Since many multimedia systems are meant to convey information to the public,there could be other hardware costs: Ogilvy andamp; Mather spent thousands ofdollars to design the kiosks that house Ogilvy On-Line, investing  8,000 persystem in capital equipment alone, Nisenholtz figures.andM;For application developers, storage is a major hardware expense, oftencosting nearly as much as the rest of a system.andP;  Intel recommends a minimumof 700MB hard-disk storage (street price: about 3,000) to develop a digitalvideo interactive (DVI) application (DVI developers use the two-boardActionMedia set with capture software, sold as a kit for $4,645).andP;  Thenthere's authoring software (the price of which varies from a few hundreddollars to nearly 10,000) and the time to train writers in its use.andM;But wait, there's more.andP;  &quot;The software and hardware resources seem to be theleast expensive part,&quot; says Tandem's Bailey.andP;  Consider the high cost ofvideo.andM;Many large corporations have elaborate video-production departments andhigh-quality footage from TV commercials, presentations or training courses.andO;Sometimes existing video can be retrofitted for use in an interactiveapplication.andP;  Sometimes it can't.andM;Show TimeandM;Nisenholtz created Ogilvy On-Line largely from existing video.andP;  But Bostonpublic TV station WGBH had a different experience in its early multimediaefforts.andP;  The station figured that it would be a piece of cake to put JuliaChild's cooking shows on interactive videodisc.andP;  Fat chance.andP;  So much newfootage had to be taped to make the application coherent that the project wasscrapped.andM;&quot;You don't have a lot of re-purposeable video,&quot; says Lippincott, who workedon the project at WGBH before moving to Lotus.andP;  Interactive multimedia, heexplains, requires a more concise presentation of information than standardvideo for TV or presentations.andP;  Active users expect more than passiveviewers.andM;&quot;When you ask Julia how to make brussels sprouts, you want to see her makebrussels sprouts, not small talk,&quot; Lippincott says.andP;  Where a high level ofinteractivity direct replies to user queries, for instance) is required, youprobably want to shoot video suited to the purpose, rather than use stock orarchived footage.andM;Get out the wallet again for this.andP;  The cheapest industrial film you'd showin public-basically, footage achieved by pointing a camera at someone'shead-can cost $1,000 a minute after all is said and done (actually, after allis scripted, cast, rehearsed, lit, said, recorded, said again, rerecorded andedited).andP;  Shell Canada's Kober says she spends about $100,000 on video foreach &quot;user-contact hour.&quot; Because video isn't viewed continuously duringmultimedia computing, a user-contact hour can contain as little as 10 minutesof actual video footage.andM;The 30 minutes of video in Shell's &quot;sour gas&quot; kiosks are good for at leastthree to four hours of user contact, Kober says.andM;VideoLogic's Maclaren says that a half hour of well-selected video can makefor three to Eve hours of interactive multimedia computing.andP;  But finding theright half hour is not cheap.andP;  Selecting it can be &quot;a long process,&quot; warnsMargaret McGovern of Effective Communication Arts, a video production housein New York City whose editors charge $185 to $235 an hour to cut and pastevideo.andM;DVI editing may be done less expensively on a PC.andP;  DVI's real-time videosoftware (part of the $4,645 developer's kit) permits do-it-yourself,real-time compression of video onto a hard disk.andP;  But its picture quality isintended for developers' eyes only.andM;For presentation-level video, you must send your edited video to Intel,which, for $250 per minute of video, uses a parallel processor to compressit.andM;Distributing an application to users requires putting the finished product ona CD or laserdisc, making it randomly accessible by PC software.andM;Disk-mastering services are not cheap&quot; either, admits Frank Price of 3M,which charges the industry's going rate of $1,800 per side to master alaserdisc and $18 per copy to produce it.andM;Future TalkandM;All technology costs will inevitably fall to make more applications feasible.andO;Compression technology will become less expensive, as will high-capacitystorage, particularly if magneto-optical technology (which allows erasableCD-ROMS) catches on in the coming years.andP;  While declining in cost,compression must be able to retain the broadcast-quality picture of anuncompressed videodisc (which it now can't), and it must be operable by auser at a desktop.andM;A new chip from C-Cube Microsystems, of San Jose, California, moves in theright direction.andP;  The CL500 chip is designed to compress motion-video in realtime by a factor of 20 and redisplay it without degradation of picturequality.andP;  The chip is expected to appear in PC products by the end of theyear, adding less than $200 to a system's price.andM;CL500 is also the first commercial implementation of JPEG, animage-compression specification proposed by the Joint Photographic ExpertsGroup as a standard for multimedia applications.andP;  (DVI uses a differentcompression scheme, but its structure allows it to incorporate JPEG or anynew compression standard.)andM;But even as technology grows less expensive, one set of costs andconsiderations in multimedia applications may never decline.andP;  Where videomeets computers, systems design becomes a new ball game.andM;&quot;You can't just be a bittwiddler,&quot; says Bill Gallas of Intel's DVI operationin Princeton, New Jersey.andP;  &quot;You have to be multidisciplinary to do this.&quot; Andyou have to be able to work with a new bunch of people.andM;I'd put that in bold headlines,&quot; says Peter Blakeney of IBM's MultimediaSolutions group in Atlanta.andP;  &quot;You guys who are fooling with the PCs, you'dbetter go over and introduce yourselves to the funny guys over there in thecreative departments.&quot;andM;In creating monthly updates to Ogilvy On-Line, Nisenholtz regularly assemblesan eclectic group that includes members of the ad agency's creative staff,MIS department, audiovisual unit and public relations staff.andP;  Strangebedfellows indeed, but folks who'd better start getting comfortable with oneanother.andM;&quot;Management information used to be just numbers and computer data,&quot;Nisenholtz says.andP;  &quot;But now it can also mean video, sound, graphics.andP;  I see aday when the audiovisual group and the MIS group will be together under oneheading.&quot;andM;Your only revenge, as a PC person, is that the video folks may need to learnDOS.andP;  Multimedia glossary  Newspeak of the New MediaandM;VIDEO TERMSandM;NTSC The standard U.S.andP;  format for video signals as defined by the NationalTelevision Standards Committee.andP;  Specifies that video include 30 frames persecond.andP;  Used by all U.S.andP;  TVs, VCRS, videodisc players and broadcast andcable TV transmissions, plus some scientific equipment.andM;PAL incompatible European counterpart of NTSC, specifying 25 frames persecond.andM;COMPUTER TERMSandM;DSP Digital signal processors.andP;

 A consumer-oriented recipe for interactivevideo, which will attach new-generation, &quot;smart&quot; compact-disc players to homeTV sets.andM;RTV Real-time video.andP;  DVI software that implements quick-and-dirty, real-timevideo compression.andP;  Once called &quot;edit-level video,&quot; it stores video as only10 frames per second; meant for use while developing DVI applications.andM;PLV Production-level video.andP;  The DVI video quality recommended for end-userapplications.andP;  intel performs PLV's 120-to-1 compression for customers on itsown parallel processors; it takes three hours to compress one minute ofvideo.andM;JPEG Proposed worldwide standard for image compression devised by the JointPhotographic Experts Group, experts sanctioned by the International StandardsOrganization (ISO).andM;MPEG An image-compression scheme--more sophisticated than the JPEGscheme--proposed by the Motion Picture Experts Group, which is alsoISO-sanctioned.andP;  While JPEG compresses each still frame in a video sequenceas much as possible, MPEG also performs  differencing,&quot; which notesdifferences between consecutive frames.andP;  if two consecutive frames areidentical, the second can be stored with the appropriate information.andP;  MPEGcondenses moving images about three times more tightly than JPEG, butprobably won't be implemented until 1991 or 1992.andM;BUZZWORDS AND NEOLOGISMSandM;Hypermedia Non-linear media, of which multimedia can be a form.andP;  Just ashypertext is a non-sequential, random-access arrangement of text, hypermediais a non-sequential, random-access arrangement of multiple media such asvideo, sound and computer data.andM;Edutainment Unpopular answer to the question &quot;What do you get when you crosseducational material with interactive video?&quot; A term coined by &quot;someone whoobviously knows nothing about either education or entertainment,&quot; says LauraBuddine, president of multimedia games maker Tiger Media.andM;Infortainment See Edutainment.andM;PIECE Productivity, information, education, creativity, entertainment.andO;Microsoft's trick for remembering the big five multimedia computingapplications.andM;VUI First came the CLI (command-line interface).andP;  Then come the GUI graphical user interface).andP;  Get ready for the VUI: the video user interface.andO;Actually, you don't need to get ready for it any time soon, but you mightstart wondering how to use it.andM;Mutimedia  products PC Vendors Join the Parade The technology to make videointeractive (when we say video, we mean video with sound) has been around fora while.andP;  IBM released its InfoWindow system, which puts video and graphicson a $4,000 touch-screen monitor, in 1984.andP;  If you've used an interactivetouch-screen in a museum or airport, it's probably InfoWindow or Sony'ssimilar View system.andM;PC users will appreciate that both DVI from intel and NTSC-to-VGA boards suchas VideoLogic's DVA 4000, New Media Graphics' VideoWindows, IBM's M-Motionand Redlake's Spectrum NTSC work in the DOS environment.andM;Vendors choosing to develop first for the IBM platform have done so more forthe size of the IBM market than the prowess of DOS machines.andP;  But IBM isaching to deliver a working multimedia platform.andP;  it has pledged to integrateDVI capability into some &quot;next-generation&quot; PS/2s, possibly by the end of thisyear.andP;  Tandy is already shipping the 286-based 2500XL, whose built-in CD-ROMdrive, sound chip and speaker let it run Britannica Software's Compton'sMultimedic Encyclopedia, a computerized reference guide that contains photos,music and voice-overs.andM;Microsoft, meanwhile, has formed a council of a dozen software companies todeliver extensions to Windows 3.0 that will give it integral multimediacapability by year's end.andP;  Included in the &quot;rich set&quot; of multimedia tools forPCs will be built-in and Windows-compatible authoring tools, which can helpyou create  ring tools, which can help you create complex applicationswithout formal programming.andM;Among those working on &quot;Multimedia Windows&quot; are Authorware of Minneapolis,whose Authorware Professional helps create interactive training courses, andMacroMind of San Francisco, whose Director is used to create presentationsthat con include music, video and animation.andP;  Both programs have beenavailable on the Mac for about two years; more recently, MacroMind released aruntime module that lets PCs display applications written on the Mac.andO;Authorware is fully available on the PC.andM;Multimedia authoring packages for the PC include Guide, from OwlInternational, of Bellevue, Washington; Hyperdoc, from Hyperdoc Inc., of SanJose, California; and Authology: Multimedia, from CEIT Systems, also of SanJose.andP;  Authology: Multimedia is the first real authoring package for DVI.andM;Good authoring packages make it conceivable--though not simple--fornon-technicians to assemble multimedia applications.andP;  The idea behind them isto let the expert whose ideas are being conveyed assemble the end-userapplication.andP;  MacroMind simplifies the production of interactivepresentations by letting you put icons (which may represent video segments orsound bites) in a row.andP;  Authorware lets you build interactive trainingprograms in a similar fashion.andP;  Other authoring packages use pull-down menusto generate program code.andP;  Anyone can be trained to use these tools--andtraining is essential.andM;Programmers, however, may not need a dedicated authoring system.andP;  NTSC-to-VGAboards generally provide script languages.andP;  Using the languages provided withvideo boards from VideoLogic and New Media Graphics is comparable to writinga script for communications software or stringing together a macro indatabase language.andP;  New Media Graphics' VideoWindows also supportsHewlett-Packard's NewWave application-development environment, which includesintegral computer-based-training development tools.andM;STEPS I AND IIandM;INPUT AND DIGITIZINGandM;Inputs to a DVI application con come from a variety of sources, includingexisting videotapes and soundtracks.andP;  Because th' text and graphics files areal ready digitized, they are not processed through the ActionMedia captureboard.andP;  But video and audio information must be processed before it con beincorporated into the application.andM;Digitizing VideoandM;The ActionMedia capture board converts RGB signals from a live camera orvideo recording into digital data, line by line, and encodes them, pixel bypixel, according to color and brightness.andM;Digitizing AudioandM;Audio is digitized by the ActionMedia capture board at 14 bits per sample.andO;Special software buffers minimize distortion during playback, allowing forhigh-fidelity sound.andM;STEP IIIandM;DEVELOPING AN APPLICATIONandM;Developing a DVI application means editing and coordinating all the digitizedinformation available to you.andP;  This may include titling still images or videosequences, adding menus and buttons so that the user can manipulate videosequences and so forth.andM;In CandM;C code offers the greatest level of control for developing a DVI application.andM;Intel's set of runtime C libraries includes modules for realtimesynchronization of audio and video, for graphics routines and for TV-Iikeadjustments such as brightness, contrast, wipes and fades.andM;Using Authology: MultimediaandM;The first full-blown authoring system for DVI, the $4,500 Authology:Multimedia, from CEIT Systems, of San Jose, California, provides an expensivebut easy development system in which to mix audio, video, text and computergraphics.andM;With Authology, you don't have to manage each piece of a DVI presentationindividually.andP;  Instead, you can assemble and join &quot;panels,&quot; each with its owncombination of video, audio, animation and graphics.andM;Using MediascriptandM;Another DVI scripting language, Mediascript, from the Network TechnologyCorporation, of Springfield, Virgina, balances the difficulty and expense ofcustom C programming with the ease of an authoring system by offering ahigher-level language for DVI programming than C. Though this script-basedsystem is more difficult to learn than the menu-based Authology, Mediascriptgets closer to the C code underlying DVI, which provides more precise andflexible control of a DVI application.andM;STEP IVandM;COMPRESSIONandM;Because video information consumes so much space (a CD-ROM disc holds 74minutes of audio but only 30 seconds or so of uncompressed video), theActionMedia delivery board uses differencing and motion compensationtechniques to reduce the amount of video data.andP;  After encoding o screen ofvideo data, a differencing algorithm determines the parts of the image thatchange from frame to frame.andP;  it takes much less information to tell thedisplay processor that the background remains the some for a sequence, forexample, than it would to describe each frame anew.andM;During development, the ActionMedia delivery board con compresslow-resolution, real-time video (RTV) at 30 frames per second, yielding a&quot;rough cut&quot; of the application that can be stored on a hard disk.andM;For production-level video (PLV), Intel has created high-powered compressionalgorithms that squeeze 72 minutes of video and audio onto a CD-ROM.andM;Once compression is completed, the application con be mastered and pressedonto CD-ROM, stored on a hard disk (a very large hard disk) or sent over onetwork.andM;STEP VandM;DECOMPRESSION AND PLAYBACKandM;Any user with an ActionMedia delivery board con run a DVI application.andO;Decompression of video and audio occurs in real time as the user interactswith the application.andM;Multiple bitmaps are in the delivery board's video RAM at any given time; theboard &quot;unpacks&quot; one video frame at a time.andP;  Intel's decompression algorithmexploits the fact that the human eye is much less sensitive to colorvariations than to grayscale variations by using smaller bitmaps for colordata than for gray-scale data.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
