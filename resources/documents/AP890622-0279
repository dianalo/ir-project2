People will lose theirjobs. Defaulting borrowers will be sued,'' L. William Seidman saidWednesday in a speech to financial journalists in New York.   ``Large amounts of property will be sold in difficult markets.And, of course, the taxpayers will bear the burden through futuretaxes,'' he said.   The FDIC has taken control of 223 savings and loans in the lastfew months at the request of the Bush administration.   ``We expect that number to increase to almost 300 by the time thepresident signs the Sandamp;L bill,'' Seidman said.   Seidman said he expects President Bush will sign the new bailoutbill by August. The measure is aimed at correcting the mistakes ofthe last decade, he said.   However, one thing that has yet to be addressed is the industry'sinterest-rate mismatching, where Sandamp;Ls essentially borrow short butlend long in fixed-rate mortgages, and where the cost of loaningmoney is higher than the interest paid on savings.   Bills already passed in the House and Senate require strongercapital for Sandamp;Ls based on standards used for banks. They also callfor factual accounting, ``rather than the ill-fated `smoke andmirrors' of the past,'' Seidman said.   In addition, they call for double supervision of Sandamp;Ls, with theFDIC serving as the backup supervisor for the industry, and forcreation of a comprehensive vehicle called the Resolution TrustCorp. to handle insolvent Sandamp;Ls.   He said the FDIC may play a role in operating the RTC, which hesaid may have to handle about $400 billion in assets from failedinstitutions.   ``To give you a view of the size of the job, the FDIC in itsentire existence has dealt with about $160 billion in assets,'' hesaid.   Seidman also said that banks are continuing to fail at a highrate. So far this year, 96 banks have failed or required governmentassistance, about the same number as in 1988.   The FDIC expects 150 to 180 bank failures in 1989, down from lastyear's post-Depression record of 221, Seidman said. The prediction,he said, was based on a decline in the number of ``problem banks''to 1,282 now compared with a high of 1,624 in June 1987.   But Seidman predicted there would be a dramatic drop in theamount of bank assets and deposits handled by the FDIC.   ``We anticipate handling about $10 billion of assets in 1989, orabout 12 percent of what we handled last year,'' he said.   Seidman reiterated that the Sandamp;L rescue will be the costliestfinancial bailout in U.S. history _ more than the ``Marshall Plan,Chrysler, New York City and Penn Central bailouts all combined, andby a mile.''   ``In fact, it will probably cost every man, woman and child inthe U.S. about $1,000 each,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
