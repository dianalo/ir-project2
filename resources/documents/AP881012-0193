Robin Tallon,D-S.C., said in a letter to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.   The credit guarantees are supposed to be reserved forAmerican-grown crops only, although the Agriculture Department saysit will provide them for the American-grown portion of a blendedshipment if the foreign-produced portion does not exceed 25 percentof the entire package.   Fourteen of 19 exporters monitored by federal investigatorsreceived government credit guarantees for entire shipments thatwere certified as 100 percent American tobacco but which actuallyblended U.S. and imported leaves, investigators told a Houseagriculture subcommittee last week.   The findings have agitated tobacco-state congressmen who saythey are not only concerned about potential fraud but believe thecredit guarantee program should be reserved for crops producedexclusively by American farmers.   The case already is under investigation by the U.S. attorney'soffice in Raleigh, N.C., said lawmakers and officials of theGeneral Accounting Office and Department of Agriculture inspectorgeneral's office.   Tallon said in his letter he was ``shocked and angered'' tolearn of the wrong certification. ``By any definition thisconstitutes fraud.''   He said any exporters who deliberately misrepresented a shipmentas being completely American ``not only stole from the taxpayers ofthis country but they also stole sales opportunities from ourtobacco farmers.''   He asked Thornburgh to make sure that any such exporter be``brought to justice.''   Tallon in an interview acknowledged that the U.S. attorney inRaleigh would most likely be free to call on the FBI forassistance. But he said it was important to contact the attorneygeneral to urge such action.   ``I don't know what kind of staff they have'' at the U.S.attorney's office, he said. ``This thing is far more involved,complex and complicated.'' He expressed hope that the FBI wouldexamine all pertinent records of exporters and banks that providedadvance payments to the exporters under the guarantee program.   ``And the end users, the people who supposedly purchased thetobacco,'' he said.   Tallon also renewed his criticism of the way the matter has beenhandled by USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service. The agency scoffedat initial reports from Iraq that not all of the tobacco beingshipped was American.   FAS Administrator Thomas O. Kay told the House AgricultureCommittee's tobacco and peanuts subcommittee last week that he hadno reason to doubt the word of the exporters. He said the complaintfrom Iraq was explained to him as an ill-founded rumor started by adisappointed Zimbabwean exporter.   Tallon said, however, that testimony at the hearing left himunsatisfied.   ``The question begs to be answered: Who's trying to cover upwhat?'' he said. ``I'm saying, bring in the FBI and see if anyoneelse gets caught in the loop.''</TEXT></DOC>
