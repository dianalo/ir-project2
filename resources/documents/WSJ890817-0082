London House, a psychological research firm, administered tests to 70 chief executives -- half of them at Fortune 500 companies and half of them from the 500 list of Inc., a magazine for entrepreneurs. The tests measured drive and creativity along with the ability to reason and handle stress. The results: Members of the two groups showed very different personality traits.    The Inc. 500 executives were far more able to work under pressure than their big-company counterparts. They were more satisfied with doing a job for its own sake, but suffered more from feelings of inadequacy. Fortune 500 executives, on the other hand, demonstrated a strong drive to climb up through an organization and an instinct for leadership.    The standout skill of Fortune chiefs was their ability to communicate. On a vocabulary test with words such as jejune, obstreperous and abstemious, they scored better than 90% of a control group of corporate executives.    In contrast, the Inc. executives &quot;were pretty poor in communications,&quot; says Donald Moretti, director of testing systems at London House, which is based in Park Ridge, Ill. The Inc. executives' strong suit: Creativity, an area in which the Fortune executives didn't shine at all.    Business Isn't a Bore,    Schools Tell Minorities    WITH MINORITIES underrepresented in business schools and management ranks, some universities are starting early to entice them.    Ten schools in recent summers have joined in a program called Leadership Education and Development, or LEAD. They recruit groups of black, Hispanic and Native American high school students to convince them that business can be fun. At Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, Prof. Wes Magat encourages &quot;noise, laughing and kidding&quot; in his &quot;Introduction to Economics&quot; class, part of a monthlong program paid for by the schools and corporate sponsors. This summer, the kids tackled competition and deregulation by looking at the airline industry. Many had flown to Duke and wanted to know why fares were so high. And they argued about the Eastern pilots' strike, debating how emotion -- such as union animosity toward Frank Lorenzo -- enters into strategic decisions.    That was a pleasant surprise to 17-year-old Nicole Woodard; &quot;A lot of business has to do with people,&quot; she discovered. She'd come to Duke thinking that business was mostly &quot;sitting at a desk all day doing paper work.&quot; Still, Ms. Woodard says she's going to go for her MBA only after getting her law degree.    That doesn't worry Richard Burton, an administrator of the LEAD program. Duke isn't interested in a &quot;hard sell&quot; on the importance of business, he says. And the message apparently gets through: In last year's LEAD &quot;yearbook,&quot; graduate James Freemont printed this inscription: &quot;Remember the name and I'll do the same; and don't forget money is the key to the game.&quot;    Waking a Company Out    Of a Corporate Culture    LOTS OF COMPANY presidents try to change their corporate cultures. Not all of them have a buzzer like Jim McCormick's.    During a yearlong restructuring, Mr. McCormick, president of Oryx Energy in Dallas, kept this buzzer by his side in management meetings, using it to deliver a little aural shock -- and humor -- when executives were displaying Old Culture behavior.    &quot;We're 102 years old,&quot; explains Harold Ashby, vice president, human resources and administration, for the oil and gas company. &quot;We had a lot of characteristics that were bureaucratic, paternal, risk-averse.&quot; Oryx, which was spun off from Sun Co. last year, found it hard enough to streamline the organization, he says. Changing &quot;mindset&quot; was even tougher.    That's where the buzzer came in. If someone greeted a new idea with, &quot;Well, I'm going to need to think about that,&quot; Mr. McCormick might ring his buzzer, and say, &quot;We really don't need to study this one to death.&quot; Likewise, a company consultant says, if someone said, &quot;that's the dumbest idea I ever heard,&quot; a quick buzz might remind him to be a little more constructive.    The committee also adopted laminated cards with a big red C (for Culture) on them; each executive had one and could flash it in warning at anyone else -- including Mr. McCormick. Both techniques were developed by lower-level teams, and their use gave the signal that even top managers were &quot;willing to call ourselves down,&quot; Mr. Ashby says.    The buzzer is now retired, but it sits on Mr. McCormick's office credenza, serving as a reminder to executives. Such symbols are crucial to changing behavior, Mr. Ashby says, adding, &quot;It's easy to redraw organization boxes; it's not easy to reprogram minds.&quot;    Odds and Ends    HOW WOULD Mickey cope? Executives seeking corporate wisdom can learn the Disney approach, in &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; management seminars at Epcot Center and Disney World. Part of the Disney philosophy, says seminars manager Rick Johnson, is &quot;making people happy.&quot; . . . Mindful of the beleaguered lives and high turnover of nurses, Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia now runs drawings for &quot;Stress Buster&quot; awards such as errand-running services and get-away weekends. The hospital is quick to add that it also offers flextime and &quot;competitive salaries.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
