Improvements in the accuracy of vibrator control havereduced the potential for phase inconsistencies in processed data, butfield setup procedures and variations in data processing still createconfusion. This paper describes an experiment comparing a vibrator andtwo impulsive sources. Downgoing and reflected waveforms from these threesources are analyzed at selected stages in the processing sequence. Emphasisis placed on polarity procedures during data collection and phase considerationsduring digital processing. Polarity issues are examined in detail. Downholetests compare first-arrival energy from dynamite, and ARIS impulse source,and a vibrator producing 45,000 pounds peak force. Stacked sections andVSP data recorded using the ARIS source and vibrator over a well arecompared to a synthetic seismogram derived from the lithology of thewell. The results show that controlling the vibrator ground force permitsthe polarity of the vibrator signal to be defined consistently with respectto impulsive signals for both downgoing and reflected energy.</TEXT></DOC>
