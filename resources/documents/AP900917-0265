A House vote was scheduled for Tuesday. The bill would limit theincrease of imports of shoes, clothes and other textiles to 1percent a year.   Supporters said it would halt a loss of jobs and business inthis country. Opponents maintained it would show the United Statesto be unwilling to join a freer world trade system.   Andreas van Agt, ambassador of the European Comunity, saidpassage of the legislation ``would be tantamount to eliminating allprospects of progress in this area and, even worse, will jeopardizenegotiations not just in textiles but in all other areas.''   Over 100 countries are taking part in trade negotiations thatbegan in 1986 in Uruguay. The United States and the Europeans areconsidered the most important negotiators, though a deal will notbe possible without Japan and Third World countries.   A year-end deadline has been set for agreement, though Congresshas given the Bush administration power to negotiate until March1991.   Negotiators for the first time since world trade talks beganafter World War II are dealing with farm subsidies, services suchas banking and air travel and ``intellectual property'' such asbooks, patents and computer programs.   These industries now provide many more jobs in the United Statesand other industrial countries than the production of traded goodsaddressed in previous trade talks.   The hope is to increase the current $4 trillion worth ofinternational trade every year and to reduce the $250 billion thatsubsidies to farmers are estimated to cost taxpayers and consumersannually.   President Bush has promised to veto the bill, as PresidentReagan vetoed two like it. But the Senate has enough votes tooverturn a veto, though some senators could change sides after aveto vote is issued.   ``Passage of this bill would disrupt negotiations on rulesnecessary to protect all U.S. industries from unfair tradepractices,'' Michael J. Boskin, chairman of Bush's Council ofEconomic Advisers wrote in a letter to Congress.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III added in a letter of hisown that the bill would violate agreements of the United Stateswith countries supporting it in the Gulf crisis.</TEXT></DOC>
