On October14, 1988, the FAA published a final rule which revised the classificationand pilot/equipment requirements for conducting operations in a TCA (53FR 40318). Specifically, the rule: (a) Establishes a single-class TCA;(b) requires the pilot-in-command of a civil aircraft operating withina TCA to hold at least a private pilot certificate, except for a studentpilot who has received certain documented training; and (c) eliminatesthe helicopter exception from the minimum navigational equipment requirement.The FAA published a final rule on June 21, 1988, effective in part on July1, 1989, which requires Mode C equipment when operating within 30 milesof any designated TCA primary airport from the surface to 10,000 feet MSL,except for operations by certain aircraft types specifically excluded (53FR 23356). On February 3, 1987, the FAA published a final rule which established requirementspertaining to the use, installation, inspection, and testing of Air TrafficControl Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) and Mode S transponders in U.S.-registeredcivil aircraft (53 FR 3380). The rule requires a transponder for operationin each TCA. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The TCA program was developed to reduce the midair collision potentialin the congested airspace surrounding an airport with high density airtraffic by providing an area in which all aircraft will be subject to certainoperation rules and equipment requirements. The density of traffic and the type of operation being conducted in theairspace surrounding major terminals increase the probability of midaircollisions. An extensive study in 1970 found that the majority of midaircollisions occurred between a general aviation (GA) aircraft and eitheran air carrier, military or another GA aircraft. The basic causal factorcommon to these conflicts was the mix of uncontrolled aircraft operatingunder visual flight rules (VFR) and controlled aircraft operating underinstrument flight rules (IFR). TCA's provide a method to accommodate theincreasing number of IFR and VFR operations. The regulatory requirementsof TCA airspace afford the greatest protection for the greatest numberof people by providing ATC with an increased capability to provide aircraftseparation service, thereby minimizing the mix of controlled and uncontrolledaircraft. To date, the FAA has established a total of 23 TCA's. The FAA is proposingto take action to modify or implement the application of these proven controltechniques to more airports to provide greater protection of air trafficin the airspace regions most commonly used by passenger-carrying aircraft.On August 22, 1987, the Secretary of Transportation announced nine locationsfor which the FAA would issue notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRM's) proposingestablishment of TCA's. The nine candidates cited qualify for TCA statusby meeting the criteria published in FAA Handbook 7400.2, ``Proceduresfor Handling Airspace Matters.'' The criteria for establishing a TCA arebased on factors which include the number of aircraft and people usingthat airspace, the traffic density, and the type or nature of operationsbeing conducted. Accordingly, guidelines have been established to identifyTCA locations based on two basic elements_the number of enplaned passengersand the number of aircraft operations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Pre-NPRM Public Input </ITAG>Airspace Meetings Pre-NPRM airspace meetings were held on July 12 and 13, 1988, to allowlocal aviation interests and airspace users an opportunity to present inputon the design of the proposed Charlotte TCA. During the course of thesemeetings there were presentations from Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association(AOPA), three local user groups (Bradford Airport and Aerobatic Pilots,Bermuda High Soaring School, and Lenoir Aviation Club), private pilots,and concerned citizens. The FAA also accepted written comments as well.At the meetings, AOPA supported the idea of forming a TCA Ad Hoc Committeeto help in the development of a TCA design for Charlotte, which, they stressed,would help ensure the use of VFR landmarks in its development. (The committeewas formed; their input will be discussed later.) AOPA further discussedthe advantages of a TCA and the VFR corridor concept. Additionally, considerablediscussion was centered on the Mode C rule (Notice No. 88-2). Bradford Airport and Aerobatic Pilots' representative expressed a desirefor a low altitude waiver for aerobatic activity around Bradford Field.Bermuda High Soaring School requested a cutout within a 5-mile radius ofthe Chester Airport. The Soaring School also requested the floor of theTCA in that area be raised from 6,000 feet MSL to 8,000 feet MSL for soaringactivities. The TCA Ad Hoc Committee comprises a cross section of the aviation communitywith technical assistance and support supplied by Charlotte Tower personnel.The committee presented its design of the proposed Charlotte TCA to CharlotteTower. Data supplied by Piedmont Airlines simulators determined an additional5 miles, from 20 to 25 miles, would be needed to protect B-727's duringclimbout in hot weather. The committee stated that the pre-NPRM designof the TCA would expose VFR pilots operating below the 3,000 foot shelfto antennas on both sides of the shelf, and would need to be modified toraise the floor of the 20-25 mile shelf from 6,000 feet MSL to 8,000 feetMSL to allow more operating airspace for glider operation at Chester, SC.The majority of private pilots' comments supported the TCA concept butwere opposed to the Mode C rule (Notice No. 88-2). The FAA evaluated all the comments and designs received on this proposal.A common recommendation was to raise the floor of the TCA in the 20-25mile shelf from 6,000 feet MSL to 8,000 feet MSL for soaring and glideractivity. The 20-25 mile shelf east and west of Charlotte was raised to8,000 feet MSL. The floor remained 6,000 feet MSL south and north of Charlottedue to the need to contain aircraft executing simultaneous approaches.Another issue mentioned was raising the floor between the 11-20 mile shelfnortheast of the airport. The floor was raised from 3,000 feet MSL to 3,600feet MSL to allow additional space for obstacle clearance. A cutout was requested for Chester Airport by user groups. A cutout wasprovided for the Chester Airport in the 20-25 mile shelf due to its extensiveglider activity. A low altitude waiver was requested around Bradford Field by aerobaticpilots. This concern will be satisfied with a local Letter of Agreement.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposal </ITAG>The FAA is considering an amendment to Part 71 of the Federal AviationRegulations (14 CFR Part 71) to establish a TCA at Charlotte/Douglas InternationalAirport, NC. Annual enplaned passengers at Charlotte/Douglas InternationalAirport almost double the 3.5 million necessary for consideration as aTCA candidate. The total airport operation count at Charlotte/Douglas InternationalAirport is 363,334 of which 65 percent is air carrier. This exceeds thecriteria necessary for establishment of a TCA. Additionally, within theproposed boundaries, more than 700,000 flight operations are conductedannually. Consequently, the FAA has determined that establishment of aTCA at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport is in the interest of flightsafety and will result in a greater degree of protection for the greatestnumber of people during flight in that terminal area. Charlotte/DouglasInternational Airport is currently served by an ARSA, which would be rescindedconcurrent with the establishment of this TCA. The proposed location isdepicted on the attached chart. Section 91.90 of Part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part91) defines TCA's and prescribes operating rules for aircraft in airspacedesignated as a TCA. The TCA rule provides, in part, that prior to enteringthe TCA, any aircraft arriving at any airport within the TCA or flyingthrough a TCA must: (1) Obtain appropriate authorization from ATC; (2)unless otherwise authorized by ATC, all large turbine engine-powered aircraftoperating to or from a primary airport shall operate above the designatedfloors of the TCA; (3) comply with any procedures established by ATC forsuch operations as pilot training at an airport within a TCA; (4) holdat least a private pilot certificate; (5) meet the requirements of andSection;61.95 if the aircraft is operated by a student pilot; (6) have an operableVOR or TACAN receiver; (7) have an operable two-way radio capable of communicationswith ATC on appropriate frequencies for that TCA; and (8) be equipped withthe applicable operating transponder and automatic altitude reporting equipmentspecified in paragraph (a) of andSection; 91.24, except as provided in paragraph(d) of that section. Any aircraft departing from an airport located insidethe TCA is required to receive a clearance from ATC prior to takeoff.All aircraft operating within a TCA are required to comply with all ATCclearances and instructions and any FAA arrival or departure traffic patternfor the airport of intended operation. However, the rule permits ATC toauthorize deviations from any of the operating requirements of the rulewhen safety considerations justify the deviation or more efficient utilizationof the airspace can be attained. Ultralight vehicle operations and parachutejumps in a TCA may only be conducted under the terms of an ATC authorization.Definitions, operating requirements, and specific airspace designationsapplicable to TCA's may be found in andSection;andSection;72.12, 71.401, and71.403 of Part 71 (14 CFR Part 71) and andSection;andSection;91.1 and 91.90of Part 91 (14 CFR Part 91). The standard configuration of a TCA consists of 3 concentric circles centeredon the primary airport extending to 10, 20, and 30 miles respectively.The vertical limits of the TCA are 12,500 feet above MSL, with the floorestablished at the surface in the inner area and at levels appropriateto containment of operations in the outer areas. Variations of these criteriamay be authorized contingent upon terrain, adjacent regulatory airspace,and factors unique to the terminal area. The airspace configuration containedherein is the result of an extensive staff study conducted by the localFAA authority after obtaining public input from informal airspace meetingsand coodinating with the FAA regional office. The FAA has determined thefollowing proposed TCA airspace configuration is consistent with TCA objectivesand allows consideration of terminal area flight operations and terrain:1. That airspace extending upward from the surface to and including 10,000feet MSL within a 11-mile radius of the primary airport, excluding thatairspace within a 2-mile radius of the Gastonia Airport. This airspaceis necessary to contain large turbine-powered aircraft within the confinesof the TCA while operating to and from the primary airport and allow foringress/egress to Gastonia Airport without affecting the primary airport.2. That airspace extending upward from 3,600 feet MSL to and including10,000 feet MSL between the 11-mile radius and the 20-mile radius of theprimary airport and that airspace within a 2-mile radius of the GastoniaAirport within the 11-mile radius of the primary airport. This airspaceis needed to provide sufficient room for vectoring aircraft arriving anddeparting Charlotte/Douglas International Airport. 3. That airspace extending upward from 6,000 feet MSL to and including10,000 feet MSL between the 20- and 25-mile radius of the primary airport,excluding that airspace from the Charlotte/Douglas VOR 053anddegrees; radialclockwise to the Charlotte/Douglas VOR 120anddegrees; radial, and excludingthat airspace from the Charlotte/Douglas VOR 242anddegrees; radial clockwiseto the Charlotte/Douglas VOR 293anddegrees; radial. This airspace is neededto allow sufficient airspace for departures and inbound mixing of aircraft.4. That airspace extending upward from 8,000 feet MSL to and including10,000 feet MSL between the 20- and 25-mile radius of the Charlotte/DouglasVOR, excluding that airspace within Paragraph 3. This airspace configurationwould provide an area to contain aircraft during climb and descent profilesto transition between the terminal and en route structure. 5. That airspace extending upward from 8,000 feet MSL to and including10,000 feet MSL between the 25- and 30- mile radius of the primary airport,excluding that airspace from the Charlotte/Douglas VOR 053anddegrees; radialclockwise to the Charlotte/Douglas VOR 120anddegrees; radial, excluding thatairspace from the Charlotte/Douglas VOR 147anddegrees; radial clockwise tothe Charlotte/Douglas VOR 218anddegrees; radial, excluding that airspacefrom the Charlotte/Douglas VOR 242anddegrees; radial clockwise to the Charlotte/DouglasVOR 293anddegrees; radial, excluding that airspace northwest of a line fromthe Charlotte/Douglas 313anddegrees; radial to the Charlotte/Douglas 320anddegrees;radial 28-mile fix, and excluding that airspace from the Charlotte/DouglasVOR 320anddegrees; radial clockwise to the Charlotte/Douglas VOR 025anddegrees;radial. This configuration would provide an area to contain aircraft duringdescent profile while allowing sufficient room for VFR operations. The preceding general summary of the proposed TCA airspace configurationidentifies that airspace which is necessary to contain large turbojet aircraftoperations at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport. ATC will providecontrol and separation of all flights within the proposed airspace boundaries.Furthermore, ATC authorization is requisite to aircraft operations withinthat airspace. Establishing of this TCA will greatly enhance the safetyof flight within the congested airspace overlying the Charlotte metropolitanarea by facilitating the separation of controlled and uncontrolled flightoperations. Section 71.403 of Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulationswas republished in Handbook 7400.6E dated January 3, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation Summary</ITAG>The FAA is required to assess the benefits and costs of each proposed rulemakingaction to assure that the public is not burdened with rules having costswhich outweigh their benefits. This section contains an analysis whichquantifies, to the maximum possible extent, the costs and benefits of establishinga TCA at Charlotte, NC. This regulatory evaluation summary should be readin conjunction with the NPRM since it provides additional background information.This proposal is intended to lower the likelihood of midair collisionsby increasing the capability of the ATC system to separate all aircraftin terminal airspace around the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport.This action was prompted by data indicating that a high percentage of nearmidair collisions reported to the FAA in terminal areas involve VOR aircraftthat are not required to be under the control of ATC. Thus, the overallobjective of this proposal is to substantially increase safety while accommodatingthe legitimate concerns of airspace users.Costs-Benefits Analysis <ITAG tagnum="81">a. Costs</ITAG>The FAA estimates the total cost expected to accrue from implementationof the proposed rule to be $6.1 million ($3.4 millon, discounted) in 1987dollars. Approximately $2.7 million (discounted) or 80 percent of the totalestimated costs would be incurred by the FAA primarily for training andadditional personnel. The remaining costs would be incurred by small GAaircraft operators who would be required under this proposal to equip theiraircraft with Mode C transponders sooner than they would have for the ARSAunder the previous FAA rule: ``Transponder With Automatic Altitude ReportingCapability Requirement (Mode C)'' (53 FR 23356, June 21, 1988). This rulebecame effective June 21, 1988, and will be implemented in two phases.Phase I, to begin in July 1989, will require a transponder with Mode Cat and above 10,000 feet MSL and in the vicinity (30 nautical miles) ofTCA primary airports. There are currently 23 TCA's.Phase II will implement a transponder with Mode C requirement in the airspacein the vicinity (10 nautical miles) of ARSA primary airports. Phase IIbecomes effective on December 30, 1990, and will affect over 135 ARSA's.Also in Phase II, a transponder with Mode C will be required at other designatedairports for which either a TCA or ARSA has not been adopted. Consequently,most aircraft without Mode C transponders would need ATC authorizationto fly within 30 nautical miles of a primary TCA airport, within 10 nauticalmiles of a primary ARSA airport, or within controlled airspace of otherdesignated airports that would also require Mode C transponders.Thus, this evaluation, as well as the Mode C rule, assumes that all aircraftwithout Mode C would acquire such equipment rather than circumnavigatethe subject airport. The only aircraft without this equipment would benonelectrical and antique types. Costs to these types of aircraft operatorshave already been accounted for by the Mode C rule. As a result, aircraftoperators impacted by this proposal would only incur the opportunity costof capital by requiring them to acquire, install, and maintain Mode C transpondersone and a half years earlier than they would be required to do so in accordancewith Phase II of the Mode C rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">b. Benefits</ITAG>This proposed rule is expected to generate potential benefits primarilyin the form of enhanced safety to the aviation community and the flyingpublic. Such safety, for instance, would take the form of reduced casualtylosses (namely, aviation fatalities and property damage) resulting froma lowered likelihood of midair collisions because of increased positivecontrol in airspace to be established by the TCA. In addition, potentialbenefits are expected to accrue in the form of improved operational efficiencyon the part of FAA air traffic controllers.Ordinarily, the potential benefits of this proposal would be the reductionin the probability of midair collisions resulting from converting the existingARSA to a TCA. However, because of the recent Mode C rule (and to someextent, the rule for Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance (TCAS), 54 FR940, January 10, 1989), the number of potential midair collisions avoidedby this proposal is expected to be significantly lower. Nevertheless, thisproposal is still expected to accrue benefits in terms of enhanced safety,though on a much smaller scale.This point can be illustrated with the use of statistical models basedon actual and projected critical near midair collision (NMAC) incidentsin lieu of actual midair collisions. (A critical NMAC is an event involvingtwo aircraft coming within 100 feet of each other; the fact that they donot collide is not due to an action on the part of either pilot; but, rather,it is due purely to chance.) Since midair collisions involving Part 135aircraft and especially Part 121 aircraft are rare, the use of criticalNMAC's will serve to illustrate, to some degree, the potential improvementsin aviation safety of implementing this proposal.Simple regression analyses were prepared for this evaluation which focusedon critical NMAC's and aircraft operations in the 23 existing TCA's andin a random sample of 23 of the existing 79 ARSA's (as of 1986 and 1987).The results of these analyses indicated that TCA's have approximately 68percent fewer critical NMAC's annually, on average, than ARSA's. Whilethere is no demonstrated relationship between NMAC's and actual midaircollisions, the lower NMAC rate does indicate a more efficient separationof aircraft in congested airspace.As the result of these findings, if the existing Charlotte ARSA were toremain unchanged (and the recent Mode C and TCAS rules were not in effect),the Charlotte Terminal Area would be expected to experience approximately2.4 critical NMAC's annually (or 37 critical NMAC's over the next 15 years).If, however, the ARSA were to become a TCA, this figure would reduce toapproximately 0.7 critical NMAC's annually (or 12 critical NMAC's overthe next 15 years). Thus, over the next 15 years, this proposal could resultin the reduction of approximately 25 critical NMAC's. However, it is importantto note that many, if not most, of these potential critical NMAC's wouldnever materialize as predicted primarily because of the ``Mode C'' ruleas it is applied to the Charlotte ARSA and, to some extent, the ``TCAS''rule.According to Phase II of the Mode C rule, all aircraft operating within10 nautical miles (except for flights under the outer 5-mile ``shelf'')of an ARSA primary airport must be equipped with a Mode C Transponder.Phase I of the Mode C rule requires, as of July 1989, aircraft operatingwithin 30 nautical miles of a TCA to be equipped with a Mode C transponder.These requirements are expected to significantly reduce the risk of midaircollisions in ARSA's and TCA's. For this reason, the primary safety benefitof this proposal to create a TCA in 1989 at Charlotte is that the safetyenhancements of the Mode C and TCAS requirements will occur one and a halfyears earlier than they otherwise would be expected without this proposal.A second safety benefit would be in terms of the lowered likelihood ofmidair collisions as the result of expanding the lateral boundaries ofpositive ATC by 20 nautical miles through replacing the Charlotte ARSAwith a TCA.Thus, the safety benefits of the establishment of a new TCA, while positive,would be less than would otherwise accrue in the absence of the Mode Cand TCAS rules. Since this proposal essentially extends the effects ofthe Mode C rule, virtually all of its potential safety benefits are assumedto be part of that rule. Such benefits cannot be estimated separately and,therefore, are considered to be inextricably linked primarily to the ModeC rule. Over a 15-year period, the Mode C rule is expected to generatetotal potential safety benefits of $344 million (discounted, in 1987 dollars).(The Mode C rule benefits estimate of $310 million for 10 years has beenadjusted to a 15 year period for the purpose of comparability with theTCAS rule and other FAA rulemaking actions.) It is important to note thatpart of these safety benefits would be attributed to the TCAS rule. Thus,the potential safety benefits of this proposal, and the Mode C and TCASrules are considered to be inextricably linked.Another potential benefit of the proposed rule would be improved operationalefficiency on the part of FAA air traffic controllers. Under the proposedrule, Mode C transponder requirements would ease controller workload peraircraft being controlled because of the reduction in radio communications.The proposed rule would also make potential traffic conflicts more readilyapparent to the controller. As the result of improved operational efficiency,the impact of the controller workload increased by separation requirementsin the proposed TCA would be somewhat offset because of the controller'sability to adjust the volume of VFR traffic in any given portion of theTCA.Improved operational efficiency should generate other types of benefitsin the form of significant reductions in the number of VFR aircraft requestsdenied and VFR aircraft delayed during busy periods. As the result of convertingthe existing Charlotte ARSA to a TCA, the improved operational efficiencywould accrue because of the availability of additional air traffic controllers.If the Charlotte ARSA were to remain intact, such air traffic personnelwould not be required. Therefore, potential benefits of improved operationalefficiency, which are not considered to be quantifiable in monetary termsin this evaluation, would be attributed to this proposal rather than eitherthe Mode C rule or TCAS rule.c. Comparison of Benefits and CostsThe total cost that would accrue from implementation of the proposed ruleis estimated to be $3.4 million (discounted, in 1987 dollars). Approximately,20 percent of this total cost estimate would fall on those GA aircraftoperators without Mode C transponders in the form of opportunity costsby requiring them to acquire such avionics equipment, including maintenance,one and a half years sooner than they otherwise would under the statusquo. The typical individual GA aircraft operator impacted would incur anestimated one-time cost ranging from $126 to $280 (discounted) under theproposed rule. (As the result of the opportunity cost concept, the derivationof these cost estimates are too complex to discuss briefly. Therefore,the reader should refer to the detailed regulatory evaluation, which iscontained in the docket, for a full explanation of the method by whichthese costs estimates were made.)The potential benefits of the proposed rule would be the lowered likelihoodof midair collisions from the conversion of the existing ARSA to a TCA.The number of midair collisions avoided and their respective monetary valuesannot be estimated for this proposal independent of the Mode C and TCASrules, but the FAA believes the risk would be substantially reduced. AnFAA analysis prepared for this evaluation, however, has shown that criticalnear midair collisions occur approximately two-thirds less frequently ina TCA than within an ARSA. The FAA believes that even after the aviationcommunity complies with the Mode C and TCAS rules, locations convertingfrom ARSA's to TCA's would continue to experience reduced critical NMAC's.In addition, the proposed rule would generate improved operational efficiencybenefits on the part of FAA air traffic controllers, though they are notconsidered to be quantifiable in monetary terms.Clearly, in view of the cost of compliance relative to the significantreduction in the likelihood of midair collisions as well as improved operationalefficiency in the Charlotte Terminal Area, the FAA firmly believes theproposed rule is cost-beneficial.The Regulatory Evaluation that has been placed in the docket contains additionaldetailed information related to the costs and benefits that are expectedto accrue from the implementation of this NPRM.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted to ensure thatsmall entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened byGovernment regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules whichmay have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.''The small entities which could be potentially affected by the implementationof this proposed rule are unscheduled operators of aircraft for hire whoown nine or fewer aircraft.Virtually all of the aircraft operators impacted by this proposed rulewould be those who acquire Mode C transponder capability. The FAA believesthat all unscheduled aircraft operators (namely, air taxi operators) potentiallyimpacted by this proposed rule already have Mode C transponders due tothe fact that such operators fly regularly in or near airports where radarapproach control service has been established. Even if some of these operatorswere to acquire, install, and maintain Mode C transponders, the cost wouldnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of them.The annual FAA threshold for significant economic impact is $3,700 (1987dollars) for a small entity. According to FAA Order 2100.14A (RegulatoryFlexibility Criteria and Guidance), the definition of a small entity, interms of an air taxi operator, is one with nine aircraft owned, but notnecessarily operated.If we were to assume that a particular aircraft operator had nine aircraftwithout transponders, then the one-time cost per aircraft could be approximately$243. This figure represents the annualized cost for each impacted aircraft.The total cost per small entity would amount to an estimated $2,187. Thus,the annual worst case cost for a small entity would fall far below theFAA's annual threshold of $3,700. Therefore, the FAA believes this proposedrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">International Trade Impact Assessment</ITAG>The proposed rule would neither have an effect on the sale of foreign aviationproducts or services in the United States, nor would it have an effecton the sale of U.S. products or services in foreign countries. This isbecause the proposed rule would only potentially impact small GA aircraftoperators without Mode C, and not aircraft manufacturers. The average costof acquiring Mode C capability is estimated to range from $900 (to upgradefrom a Mode A transponder) to $2,000 (to acquire a Mode C transponder withouthaving a Mode A transponder). The cost of acquiring Mode C capability isnot considered to be high enough to discourage potential buyers of smallGA airplanes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications </ITAG>This regulation would not have substantial direct effects on the states,on the relationship between the national government and the states, oron the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levelsof government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, preparationof Federalism assessment is not warranted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>For the reasons discussed under ``Regulatory Evaluation,'' the FAA hasdetermined that this proposed regulation is not a ``major rule'' underExecutive Order 12291. This rulemaking is considered a ``significant rule''under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979).
