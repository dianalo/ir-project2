Sakharov, picked to help lead a newopposition coalition in the Soviet Congress, says the nation's``empire-like'' structure must be dismantled to end a wave ofethnic unrest.   Sakharov and populist Boris N. Yeltsin were among five lawmakerschosen Sunday to lead a 390-member faction in the 2,250-memberCongress of People's Deputies. It is the first Soviet oppositioncoalition in 70 years.   Yeltsin, a former alternate member of the ruling Politburo whohas remade himself into a populist reformer, won the most votesamong 13 candidates for the five-member governing board of theInter-regional Deputies' Group.   The group gave itself the bland name in part to allay suspicionsit is an opposition party in a country where the Communist Partyhas been the only legal party since the early 1920s.   On Sunday, when the group was to work out its program, itmanaged to agree only on calls for several parliamentarycommissions.   They include commissions to investigate responsibility for theSoviet intervention in Afghanistan and to study ethnic unrest inthe republic of Uzbekistan in December 1986.   In an interview published Sunday in the weekly Ogonyok magazine,Sakharov reiterated his respect for President Mikhail S. Gorbachevbut said the country is on the verge of economic catastrophe andthat he considers a military or right-wing coup a possibility.   Sakharov said the Soviet Union must tear down the centrallycontrolled system built by Josef Stalin and start all over again.   ``Our starting point is a forced, empire-like structure and wecannot dismantle it partially. It has to be done completely andreassemble the pieces into a whole new structure,'' the popularweekly quoted him as saying.   The 15 Soviet republics and other homelands set aside for theSoviet Union's more than 100 ethnic groups ``should getindependence to the maximum degree,'' Sakharov was quoted as saying.   ``Their sovereignty should have the minimal limits of commondefense, foreign policy, transport and communications,'' he added.   About 390 Congress deputies, including most of the best-knownpolitical and economic reformers, have joined the new group. About260 of them took part in a two-day meeting that ended Sunday, butby Sunday afternoon just 155 were around to take part in the voting.   Yeltsin received 144 votes for the governing board, followed byhistorian Yuri Afanasyev with 143, economist Gavriil Popov with132, scholar Viktor Palm from Estonia with 73 and Sakharov, humanrights activist and winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, with 69.   Yeltsin said he did not forsee the group eventually becoming amajority in the Congress, which was elected this spring in thecountry's first contested elections in seven decades.   He said the group ``was created for the protection of theminority,'' adding that ``the minority is now organized and solidenough, and we will help fight for each other's positions.''   The group unveiled its own newspaper, The People's Deputy, atthe gathering. The paper said the group grew out of ``the despairof the radically inclined minority'' at the conservative views ofthe majority of Congress members.   The official Tass news agency said Saturday that the group wasmade up of ``left-radicals,'' but that they still could work withinthe system. On Sunday, it quoted one deputy, Alexander Gelman, assaying radical approaches were necessary to reform the Sovietsystem.   ``Radicalism of the deputies assembled here is nothing otherthan realism,'' Tass quoted Gelman as saying.</TEXT></DOC>
