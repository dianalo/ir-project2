These are the first federal criminal charges in a major Texas bank-fraud case since the formation this summer of a joint task force of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department looking into wrongdoing in the state's savings and loan industry.    Federal investigators have been criticized in the past for failing to obtain criminal charges against those in the Empire case.    The 88-count indictment, which charges fraud, conspiracy and racketeering, caps a four-year investigation that had brought more than 90 convictions of borrowers, appraisers and others connected with Empire.    The indictment charges that the seven conspired to artificially inflate land values, mainly along Interstate 30 northeast of Dallas, through a series of &quot;land flips.&quot; The overvalued properties were then used as collateral for Empire loans, allowing the thrift to inflate its assets and earnings, according to the indictment.    The alleged scheme was exposed when federal regulators closed the thrift in 1984, making it the largest Sandamp;L collapse at that time and dumping about $300 million in insured deposits on the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp.    In addition to the former chief executive Spencer H. Blain Jr., the indictment names Dallas real estate developers David L. Faulkner and James L. Toler, and an associate Kenneth E. Cansler; real estate appraisers Arthur Formann and Paul D. Tannehill; and Paul A. Jensen, the former chairman of one of the five thrifts.    Mr. Blain's attorney didn't return calls, and none of the defendants could be reached for comment.    U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins said thrift losses from fraud in Texas caused &quot;serious economic harm&quot; to the country and contributed to the collapse of Empire and other Texas banks and thrifts. &quot;The amount of losses we believe occurred in this case are big enough to affect the liquidity of FSLIC,&quot; Mr. Collins said.    Mr. Collins said the newly expanded joint task force will look into allegations of fraud at more than 20 Sandamp;Ls and eight or nine banks. Bobby Gilham, FBI special agent in charge of the Dallas office, said the task force hopes to complete its investigation within the next three months.    The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, FSLIC's parent, in November 1985 sued Mr. Blain and 90 other individuals to recover $142 million in losses Empire had as a result of a &quot;scheme to defraud&quot; the thrift. The suit is pending. </TEXT></DOC>
