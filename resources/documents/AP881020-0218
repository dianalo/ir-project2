(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker's longtime bodyguard disputedhis former boss and testified the television evangelist pushed toget himself bonuses, as a trial ended Thursday in PTL's $52 millionsuit against its founder.   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds did not issue an immediateverdict in the case, which he began hearing in September. But heindicated he would award a compromise judgment.   ``I am going to prepare a fair and just adjustment between theseparties,'' he said as the hearing closed.   ``In bankruptcy court I've seen suit after suit like this one,and never a dime collected,'' Reynolds said. ``If you can't get $1million why look for $2 million?''   ``So if you find the court a little soft in the amounts, thenyou can understand why,'' said Reynolds, who is hearing the casebecause he is presiding over PTL's Chapter 11 bankruptcyreorganization.   The attorneys have until Thursday to submit any furtherinformation or pleas. Reynolds plans to present draft findingswithin 10 days of that, and the attorneys will have another 10 daysto submit responses before a final verdict.   PTL presented testimony and evidence that Bakker and his wife,Tammy, received about $9.5 million in bonuses, salaries and othercompensation from 1983 to 1987. But Bakker has said he would not beable to pay a judgment against him.   The ministry is charging the Bakkers, and an aide, DavidTaggart, with mismanaging the ministry into ruin and receivingexcessive salaries and spending ministry money for personal gain.   PTL received bankruptcy protection in June 1987, three monthsafter Bakker resigned following a sex-and-hush-money scandalinvolving former New York church secretary Jessica Hahn.   Bakker testified his salary and bonuses were approved by theministry's board of directors, and that he never requested bonusesand was not present during meetings in which they were discussed.   But Don Hardister, who served as PTL's head of security andBakker's personal bodyguard during his 11 years there, saidThursday during rebuttal questioning by PTL attorney Tom White he``was often present outside of board meetings where he hearddiscussion of bonuses between Mr. Bakker and David (Taggart).''   ``I remember one occasion where Jim was very emphatic that Davidensure Mrs. Bakker receive a bonus,'' Hardister told Reynolds.   Also during rebuttal questioning Thursday, Dana Cadwell, anaccountant in PTL's finance office, testified that an externalaudit in August 1984 showed abuse of the ministry's cash advancesystem.   She said executives of PTL, which operated a satellitetelevision network and Christian theme park at Fort Mill, failed torepay advances of up to $10,000.   ``The audit recommended that we establish a maximum employeeadvance amount,'' she said. ``Many of the outstanding cash advanceswere over six months old.''   Bakker said Thursday as he left the courthouse that he's gladthe trial is over.   ``After two years of what I've been going through, nothing ishumbling. My faith is in God. I believe God will bring me through.''   ``The real point in this case is that it was built on an IRSdocument that is erroneous. It has never been proven. It's apreliminary report that is not gospel. That is disturbing to me,''Bakker said.   The defense has argued that PTL's records have been dispersed asa result of its bankruptcy, its division into separate for-profitand church entities and investigations by a federal grand jury andthe Internal Revenue Service, making it impossible for the Bakkersto justify every payment they received.   ``As I begin to find the bits and pieces, I become angry. Thedocumentation is there. If we have to appeal it, we're ready togo,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
