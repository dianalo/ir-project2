SDH consisted of a sensitizing treatment of 44.5/sup0/C/10 min followed by a test treatment (TT) of 41.5/sup 0/C for 30,60 or 120 min. Simultaneous administration of radiation and hyperthermiawas achieved by delivering radiation in the middle of the TT. The endpointselected was the radiation dose needed to achieve either tumor controlor moist desquamation in 50% of the animals. The results were evaluatedby the thermal enhancement ratio (TER), defined as radiation dose neededto achieve endpoint in relation to dose of combined radiation and hyperthermianeeded to achieve the endpoint. SDH of tumors increased the TER significantlycompared with step-up heating (SUH). The ratios between TCD/sub 50/ valuesfor corresponding SDH and SUH increased with TT heating time and at 120min a 2.5-fold increase in the radiosensitizing effect was achieved.In the normal tissue studies SDH combined with radiation treatment gavea lower TER compared to the SDH tumor results, suggesting a possibletherapeutic gain. 36 refs.; 4 figs.; 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
