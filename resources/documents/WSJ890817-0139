Sykora, D. Eugene Simmons and three others who sold company stock between June 16 and July 17 continue to own Houston Industries shares. According to the company, Mr. Sykora retains more than 15,000 shares, and Mr. Simmons continues to own more than 5,700 shares; the holdings of the three others total more than 3,000 shares. Because of ambiguities in reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, an earlier edition stated incorrectly that the five insiders had sold substantially all of their holdings in the company.
