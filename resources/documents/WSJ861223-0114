Pratt didn't indicate what the new deadline would be, but it reiterated previous statements that it wasn't prepared to sweeten its bid for the Atlantic City, N.J.-based casino operator.    Although the hotel and casino concern indicated earlier that it wasn't prepared to extend the offer for tax reasons, Pratt said it has &quot;invested a great deal of time and effort to acquire the Class B shares. We are reluctant to abandon our effort absent of a clear indication from the estate of James M. Crosby that it will not tender its shares to us.&quot;    The estate of Mr. Crosby, Resorts' late chairman and founder, last week indicated that it wasn't interested &quot;at this time&quot; in selling its 340,783 Class B shares, or 44% voting control of the company's 752,000 Class B shares outstanding. As a result, Resorts said it is &quot;unlikely&quot; that Pratt's 51% condition for its offer would be met or that the tender offer would be successful.    Nonetheless, Jack E. Pratt, chairman, said &quot;we intend to accept and pay for all validly tendered shares of Class B stock before year end if the conditions to our offer, including the 51% condition, have been satisfied.&quot;    Pratt Hotel has said it wants to acquire control of Resorts to increase its gaming operations. Pratt owns one Atlantic City casino; Resorts owns one and currently is building a second casino. </TEXT></DOC>
