Jeffrey Toobin, an associate in Walsh's office, sent a letterMarch 15 to U.S. attorneys and attorneys general in 50 statesseeking information about other cases involving immunity.   James Wieghart, Walsh's spokesman, said Monday the letter was aroutine request to ensure that prosecutors are up-to-date on themost recent case law.   The letter asks judicial officials for ``anything you thinkmight be helpful _ established procedures, transcripts, briefs oreven informal office lore.'' The existence of the letter was firstrevealed on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal.   Defendants in the Iran-Contra case are expected to challengeWalsh on immunity because they received such grants from Congressin exchange for testifying about the Iran-Contra case last summer.   Former White House aides John M. Poindexter, Oliver L. North andbusinessman Albert Hakim were granted immunity, but Richard V.Secord, Hakim's partner, was not. The four are charged withconspiracy and theft in the Iran-Contra case.   Walsh cannot use any information from the congressional hearingsin court, and he must prove that his data was gatheredindependently. Walsh has hired former federal Judge Herbert Sternto supervise the handling of legal challenges.   U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell has set April 12 for ahearing on the immunity issue. Attorneys in the case must filetheir papers by April 7.   Wilkinson, who provided The Associated Press with a copy of theToobin letter, said he considered it a ``little bizarre that anindependent counsel would be seeking help from the state attorneysgeneral.''   Wilkinson, a Republican, noted that there is a constitutionaldispute over the existence of the independent counsels, which werecreated by Congress under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act.   The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on April 26 ona lower court decision that struck down the constitutionality ofthe special prosecutors.   Wilkinson said his ``sympathies are with the executive branch,not the legislative branch.''   But not everyone was as perturbed as Wilkinson about the letter.   LeRoy Zimmerman, the GOP attorney general in Pennsylvania, hasdirected his staff ``pass along any information or experienceswhich would be helpful'' to Walsh's people, according to BobGentzel, his spokesman.   Attorneys in the office of Travis Medlock, South Carolina'sattorney general, are still reviewing the letter, according to MarkDillard, his spokesman.   Alan Ashby, spokesman for California Attorney General John Vande Kamp, said he didn't know if his boss had received the letter.But he said the state and federal judiciary have a ``pretty closeworking relationship'' on many issues when the jurisdictionsoverlap.</TEXT></DOC>
