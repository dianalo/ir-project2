Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK </IN><TEXT>   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board's proposal to reduce deposit-insurance premiums for well-capitalized thrifts is likely to cause a rift between the industry's biggest players and its largest trade group.    Executives of several of the nation's largest thrifts said yesterday that they welcome the proposal, which the Bank Board outlined in very general terms last Friday. The executives' responses contrast sharply with the reaction of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, which blasted the proposal as soon as it was announced.    The U.S. League, whose membership is dominated by small thrifts that are unlikely to benefit from the Bank Board's plan, also contended that the Bank Board doesn't have the legal authority to assess variable premium rates. Other thrift lawyers, however, said that while the law is unclear, they believe the Bank Board can find justification in the law for its plan.    The split between the industry giants and the U.S. League could diminish the group's usually strong influence at the Bank Board and in Congress. Through the league, the thrift industry generally presents a united front on major regulatory and legislative issues and its positions frequently prevail.    Even if the plan fails, industry executives and lawyers viewed it as an attempt by the Bank Board to appease its critics among the industry's giants. The three Bank Board members are &quot;trying mightily to demonstrate that they're not going to tax the healthy companies out of existence,&quot; said Michael Roster, a thrift lawyer with the firm of Morrison andamp; Foerster, Los Angeles. &quot;They want to keep the industry together, so they have to keep the strong guys in,&quot; he added.    The proposed reduction in insurance premiums to the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp. is designed in part to keep thrifts that can meet the capital standards of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. from transferring to that insurer, which currently charges premiums that are only 40% as high as FSLIC's. Forty thrifts had begun the process of switching to the FDIC from the FSLIC as of March 31, 1987, when Congress barred further switches until Aug. 10, 1988. However, so far only eight of those 40 thrifts have said they definitely want to switch, the Bank Board said.    James F. Montgomery, chairman of Great Western Financial Corp., the Beverly Hills, Calif.-based parent of the nation's third-largest thrift, said he is &quot;very pleased&quot; if the Bank Board recognizes that a company like Great Western with strong capital is really paying an onerous amount of premium.    Mr. Montgomery noted that Great Western, which has tangible capital equal to about 6% of its assets of $28.6 billion, is paying $25 million more in annual premiums to the FSLIC than it would pay to the FDIC. &quot;We've said many times that we think capital adequacy is the most important issue and to reflect that in insurance premiums would make sense to me,&quot; Mr. Montgomery said.    Robert F. Adelizzi, president of Home Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, San Diego, which is trying to switch to the FDIC, said the Bank Board's proposal is &quot;something that we absolutely are in favor of.&quot;    Other executives said their enthusiasm would depend on how the Bank Board's detailed plan, to be released this week, treats good will, which is an intangible asset generated by acquisitions. Under FDIC rules, goodwill is deducted from capital, while the FSLIC doesn't require such a subtraction.    Norman M. Coulson, president of Glenfed Inc., the Glendale, Calif.-based parent of the nation's fifth-largest thrift, noted that his institution has good will on its books stemming from acquisitions of troubled thrifts that were made in the early 1980s to help the FSLIC. &quot;I'm concerned about how they draw the line,&quot; he said.    Mr. Roster of Morrison andamp; Foerster said he believes it is unlikely that the Bank Board will adopt the tougher FDIC accounting rules on good will, because doing so would penalize thrifts that assisted the FSLIC in the early 1980s. </TEXT></DOC>
