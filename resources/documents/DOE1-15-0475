Results recorded in several diagramslead to the conclusion that pure condensation or washing only leads touseful reduction of SO/sub 2/ content with an extremely long dwell time,and that the content of NO/sub x/ waste gas can be reduced by more than50% by introducing ozone into the flow of crude gas. Catalytic processesfor NO/sub x/, SO/sub 2/, CO and hydrocarbons and waste gas condensatewashers with the addition of means of neutralisation in reducing theSO/sub 2/ content have also proved successful.
