(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   While the FBI investigates last week'sbombing death of a federal judge in Alabama, investigators here arestill puzzling over the mysterious 1987 slayings of a Biloxi judgeand his wife.   The investigation has unearthed links among the Dixie Mafia, anorganized crime group that once flourished on Mississippi's``Golden Gulf Coast''; a sex and extortion ring allegedly run froma Louisiana prison; the mayor of this coastal city; and a purportedhitman sitting in a Georgia jail.   But while there are many pieces to the puzzle, few of them fittogether.   A federal grand jury has spent months investigating the deathsof Circuit Judge Vincent Sherry, 58, and his wife, former BiloxiCouncilwoman Margaret Sherry, 57. So far, there have been noindictments.   The Sherrys were shot to death Sept. 14, 1987, in their home.The judge was shot three times in the face, and his wife four timesin the head. Authorities said the same .22-caliber pistol was used.   Their bodies were discovered two days later by Vincent Sherry'sformer law partner, Peter Halat, who has since become mayor ofBiloxi _ and has been implicated in the crime.   Halat worked with Sherry until Sherry was appointed judge in1986.   Louisiana prison inmate Bobby Joe Fabian, a convicted murderer,has said Halat attended a 1987 meeting at the Louisiana StatePenitentiary at Angola in which the killings were plotted. Halatangrily denied the accusations last August, saying he wasn't at theprison when the meeting allegedly took place.   Fabian claims the Sherrys were killed because inmates believedthe judge kept about $400,000 from an extortion scam that ran adsin homosexual magazines and newspapers.   Respondents to the ads were told their ``friend'' was gettingout of the Louisiana prison and needed money for airfare to meetthem. Authorities claim hundreds of thousands were taken in thescheme.   An alleged member of the Dixie Mafia, Kirksey McCord Nix Jr.,has been indicted in the scam. Fabian claims that Nix, who isserving a life sentence for killing a New Orleans grocer, was aparty to the murder plot.   Nix, 46, said recently that he'd take a lie detector test aslong as his accusers and investigators would do the same.   Halat said he represented Nix for nearly 10 years but severedhis ties in May 1988. He said he wouldn't comment further and``take the chance of compromising the ongoing investigation.''   ``Number one, I want the case solved. Number two, after it issolved, I don't want anything to be tainted by publicity,'' Halatsaid in an interview.   Federal and state officials also are keeping mum.   ``All I can tell you is that we've been trying to hold the pressdown so we can do the job the way it ought to be done,'' said U.S.Attorney George Phillips.   Another person who has been linked to the case is John ElbertRansom, 62, of Smyrna, Ga., who allegedly was paid $35,000 to killthe couple, according to Fabian.   Ransom was indicted in November for the July 19 killing ofRodney Gaddy, 33, in Coweta County, Ga. Investigators inMississippi have said that killing had a similar style to theSherry slayings.   In 1979, Ransom was arrested on an unregistered firearm chargeafter conviction of a felony and was sentenced to 14 years.   Ransom, being held without bond in a Newnan, Ga., jail, hasrecently denied that he killed the Sherrys or that he was a hitman,but acknowledged that he knew Nix.   While speculation persists that mob violence was involved,others contend the hit on the Sherrys was ordered by enemies thejudge made while representing drug dealers.   Mississippi and Louisiana authorities have refused to discussthe details that allegedly link Ransom to the crime. But part ofthe documentation comes from investigations by private investigatorRex Armistead, hired by the Sherrys' family.   Halat, 46, who became mayor in July, maintains the publicityabout the Sherry killings and grand jury investigation haven't hurtthe city. However, he says the reverse is true about his wife andfamily.   ``I'm a big boy. I can handle this. But who's going to pay mywife back for the stares and whispers at the grocery store. Who'sgoing to pay back my children for things that are said at school?   ``If anybody ... says that I had anything to do with that case,I'll tell them to their face they're liars, that it's not true,''Halat said.</TEXT></DOC>
