(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   US Sprint Communications Co. told afederal agency that it is getting fewer complaints about billingproblems and the problems are being resolved more quickly.   US Sprint's report on Tuesday was in response to a letterreceived three weeks ago from the Federal CommunicationsCommission. The FCC said fines may be necessary if Sprint did nothandle customer complaints more efficiently.   The FCC will have a chance to ask questions about Sprint'sresponse at a meeting today in Washington, said John Hoffman,Sprint senior vice president.   US Sprint, which has steadily lost money since its creation as ajoint venture two years ago, is the nation's third-largestlong-distance company after American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. andMCI Communications Corp.   The long-distance company's report said the number of complaintsdropped to 111 in June from 211 in January, and it took Sprint anaverage of 13 days to resolve a complaint in June, compared to anaverage of 30 days in January.   Sprint said it had received 149 complaints from the FCC lastmonth but 30 of the 52 complaints received in the final week ofJuly were postmarked in April, May and June.   ``If those complaints had been received and processed by USSprint in those earlier months, we believe the declining trendcould still prevail,'' said the report, which was signed by WilliamT. Esrey, president and chief executive officer of UnitedTelecommunications Inc. of Westwood. Esrey also is serving asSprint's president.   United Telecom owns Sprint equally with the GTE Corp. ofStamford, Conn., but will take majority ownership later this year.   The FCC said it had to review the report before commenting on it.   ``It would be premature of me to say anything,'' said Greg Vogt,chief of the enforcement division of the FCC's common carrierbureau.   After the FCC letter was sent, Vogt had said the volume ofcomplaints was not as serious as the number of times the agency hadto go back to Sprint about a particular complaint.   Sprint's report defended the number of its repeated complaints.It said they occurred in 14 percent of the 955 complaints sent bythe FCC in the first half of the year.   The report also listed procedures that Sprint began on Aug. 1 toimprove the handling of complaints. A service center in Dallas willcontact customers 10 days after Sprint resolves a dispute to makesure the customer is satisfied.   Sprint said while improvements could be made, the brunt of itsbilling problems were in the past.</TEXT></DOC>
