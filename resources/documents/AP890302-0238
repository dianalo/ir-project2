Demands for a multi-party system, greater human rights andsweeping reform of the penal code were made at a meeting to recruitnew members to the party re-established itself in January after a40-year pause.   The party was dissolved when the communists came to power in 1948.   The ruling Communist Party endorsed a multi-party system for thefirst time early last month but stressed the transition to morepluralism should be gradual and orderly.      About 600 people listened to speeches by members of a provisionalsix-member presidium in an engineering company meeting hall. None ofthe presidium members is well known except the president, AndrasRevesz, 79.   A party program distributed at Wednesday's meeting advocatesparliamentary democracy, full human rights, elimination of militaryblocs and an independent, neutral Hungary.   Speakers challenged the Communist Party monopoly in every aspectof life, particularly its control of the judiciary and media.   Presidium member Tibor Baranyai said the group wants to join theSocialist International. He and others called for trade unionpluralism and praised Social Democratic policies developed by WillyBrandt, former chancellor of West Germany, and former ChancellorBruno Kreisky of Austria.   Several speakers, including Baranyai, warned of Communistinfiltration and influence in the new party.   Perhaps because of those fears, the leadership has decided that,until the first party congress late this year or early next, thepresidium will include only people who belonged to the SocialDemocratic Party abolished during Communist takeover in 1948-49.   The Hungarian Parliament, which is increasingly outspoken, is topass a bill legalizing alternative political parties by Aug. 1. IfHungary implements genuine power-sharing, it would be the first Eastbloc country to have a bona fide multiparty system.      Dozens of independent groups have formed in Hungary over the pastyear, several of which are likely to become political parties. Inaddition to the Social Democratic Party, the Smallholders Party alsoannounced its return after 40 years.</TEXT></DOC>
