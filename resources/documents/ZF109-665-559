Weinsteintold a gathering of communications researchers and professionals here lastmonth at a two-day Broadband ISDN Workshop/Seminar.andP;  The event wasco-sponsored by the Information Technology Research Centre (ITRC) andTelecommunications Research Institute of Ontario (TRIO).andM;Guest speaker Robert Pachal, vice-president, product technology anddevelopment at Toronto-based Unitel Communications Inc., said image scanningcould be a tremendous business opportunity in the near future.andP;  Pachal seesscanned information being transmitted over B-ISDN in applications such as inthe cheque clearing process at banks, and in medical consulting, where expertradiologists could videoconference with less-skilled medical staff toillustrate a complex diagnosis.andM;Pachal had words of caution and entreaty for the audience in assessing theprospects for BISDN.andP;  He noted that &quot;decisions to deploy technology boil downto revenue issues,&quot; pointing out the failure of narrowband ISDN to clear upstandards problems which subsequently caused difficulties for companies thatinvested heavily in the technology.andP;  New services, not higher speedbandwidth, and cost reductions are necessary to justify any user purchase ofa new technology, Pachal explained.andM;Pachal called on B-ISDN developers to provide the tools to implement thetechnology easily, and have network management utilities built-in.andP;  &quot;Networkmanagement should become a real part of B-ISDN.&quot;andM;Standards and system architecture options for B-ISDN figured prominently inthe presentations made at the seminar.andM;Bellcore's Weinstein stressed the need for network &quot;intelligence&quot; and notjust a wider pipeline.andP;  He suggests an orderly evolution towards broadbandnetworks and services.andM;Part of the evolution to B-ISDN will include implementing technical schemessuch as ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) and SONet (synchronous opticnetwork) to make up the protocol layers.andP;  According to Richard Vickers,manager of B-ISDN architecture and development at Bell-Northern Research inOttawa, &quot;SONet is really the key to broadband.&quot;andM;SNet is a Bellcore proposal for a family of fibre optic transmission ratesfrom the base rate of 51.84 Mbps to 13.22 Gbps.andM;Broadband applications, Vickers said, should include: research -- such assupercomputer remote access animation of simulations; manufacturing --linkingengineering workstations, databases, computers and automated manufacturingtools; service industries -- such as advertising agencies which cut couriercosts by transmitting graphic materials electronically; medical -- addingvoice annotations to an x-ray image; business -- videoconfereincing; and,residential -- narrowcast services such as specialized pay-per-view options.andM;Rremote Disk access slowandM;Vickers points out extended transfer times in certain applications, such asremotely accessing a magnetic disk where there are unacceptable delays in thetime it takes to write and read onto a disk, make even the cheaper costs ofhigh-speed broadband impractical.andP;  He suggests that optical storage systemsmay provide a solution in a remote disk access application.andM;Unitel's Pachal, however, isn't worried about overcoming technologicalstumbling blocks on the road to B-ISDN but is concerned about regularoty andtariff issues.andP;  &quot;(That's) where the challenge is, not technology.&quot;andM;Concordia University's J.F.andP;  Hayes, whose research work involves opticalfibre in a local environment, said there is a way to make progress indeveloping broadband technology without waiting for standards consensus.andP;  Henoted that it is still possible to innovate quickly in a local-area networkenvironment where standards and regulatory issues aren't a concern -- allthat would be needed are the appropriate interfaces.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
