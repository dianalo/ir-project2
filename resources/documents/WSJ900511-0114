Yet it will be a frustratingtask. The seemingly straightforward path that connects WHO tothe compelling health needs of the poorest countries makes awide detour. That detour is through myriad programs,meetings, and activities, all aimed at pursuing WHO'sopen-ended definition of health as complete physical, socialand mental well-being for all. With 22 different functions inits constitution, ranging from scientific cooperation topublic opinion, WHO has the option to be involved in anyinternational issue from bugs to bombs. And it has exercisedthat option.   In 1990, WHO has budgeted resources for 356 technicalactivities. But many of these resources are allocated totheir administration. For example, nearly half of WHO'sregional efforts are consumed by organizing andadministrating. By one calculation of staff time spent inAfrica, 4% of that time is spent on disease prevention, 4% onhuman-resource development and 65% on administration.</LP><TEXT>   The 1990-91 WHO budget totals $1.4 billion, but because ofa bias toward global and regional programs, funds that can bespent at the country level are a tiny portion of the totalbudget. The monies allocated to country-level activities inthe Americas and sub-Saharan Africa amount to only 7.9% and7.3%, respectively, of the total budget. South and East Asia,which include such desperately poor countries as Bangladeshand Nepal, receive only 5.6% of the total funds. The nationsof the Western Pacific, including such poor countries asKiribati and Vanuatu, receive only 3.4% of the total budget.   Resources trickling down to the countries most in needhave at times become a ludicrously small portion of WHOexpenditures. For example, WHO is spending less thanone-tenth of one percent of its $1.4 billion budget onmalaria control programs in Africa. Funding foraccident-prevention programs in the 34 countries of theWestern Pacific amounts to only $5,000 per year, or $147 percountry. The budget for programs to ensure drug and vaccinesafety and efficacy in Africa is merely $6,000. This amountis budgeted for 46 nations for two years and translates into$65 per country per year.   In the countries of Southeast Asia, WHO's budget toconfront the leading killer of children, acute respiratoryinfections, is just $500,000 over the next two years.Estimates place the number of Southeast Asian childrenbetween the ages of one and four at 34 million in 1990. Thismeans that WHO can contribute less than a penny per child tofight the prime childhood killer in Southeast Asia.   Not only are the portions of the budget allocated tocountry activities in the poorest countries meager, but inaddition, the poorest countries did not receive any realbudget increases in 1990-91 compared to the 1988-89 period.Yet, every single European nation received a real increase.   It is true that the European nations receive a smallproportion of total resources and that their allotment istiny on a per capita basis. Yet, it amounts to $50 million ofWHO's scarce resources. If applied to country-level programs,this amount could nearly double the regular budgetallocations for Africa. One might question not only thecritical need but also the relative ability of Europeans tofinance their own health-care programs. On average, Europeangovernments spend $642 per person on health care, compared toabout $9 per capital in the low-income countries.   Layers of bureaucracy have clouded what should be clearpriorities for WHO. Many activities have absolutely norelevance to the people with the greatest needs. Forinstance, of what possible relevance to people in needycountries such as Ethiopia or Bhutan is the development ofessential drug lists for civilian aircraft in flight?Incomprehensibly, the budget shows that the poorest countrieswith the greatest health problems receive less support fromWHO than some of the more wealthy ones. Africa, for example,receives only 16% of WHO's budget from all sources.   Ethiopia, the poorest country in the world, has beenallocated 10 cents per person for 1990-91 (combining theregular budget with other sources), or the princely sum of 5cents per person per year. Bangladesh, Tanzania andMozambique are in much the same boat. Indeed, for the poorestnations, the annual per-capita country allocation hardly everexceeds 25 cents. Yet, WHO provides twice as manycountry-level resources per capita to Saudi Arabia andSingapore as it does to Ethiopia.   The problems of the poorest countries are not consideredin program design. Seventy-five percent of the Africancountries could find use only for five of the 50 differentprograms offered by WHO. Ironically, the most frequentlyrequested program for Africa, human resource development, wasthe only one to receive a budget cut.   WHO has chosen to emphasize its role of internationalinterlocutor for all manner of health concerns. But WHO mustreevaluate its mission. The existing WHO charter provides theorganization with the authority to shift and narrow itsfocus. It should respond to the challenges of today in astraightforward priority fashion that will expand itseffectiveness.   Second, in shifting its focus, WHO must turn to theneediest. Stretching its resources across all its members haslimited the funds available to improve the grave healthproblems of the poorest. Perhaps it is time to declare Europere-built and apply its $50 million allocation to Africa.   Third, WHO staff must peel away the levels of bureaucracyand get closer to the members. By allocating resources amongthe poorest countries and relocating technical personnel tothe field, WHO may learn what the real needs are. Actionshould take place in the countries, not at WHO headquartersin Geneva.   Last, let demand determine supply. Defining the specificactivities of WHO should be the job of the membership, theministers of health and finance from developing countries,not the Geneva Secretariat, international activists orinfluential European countries. WHO should also take theunprecedented step of eliminating programs that no countrywants.   Delegates to the World Health Assembly should insist thatthe next two-year WHO budget be designed to bridge thehealth-care chasm between the rich and poor nations of theworld. Surely WHO delegates can break down the layers ofbureaucracy and the manifold interests that have constrainedthe organization's potential to do the most good.   ---   Mr. Dietrich is president of the Institute forInternational Health and Development, which is affiliatedwith the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.</TEXT></DOC>
