University of Chicago researcher S. Jay Olshansky said the upperlimit of human life expectancy is set because uncontrollableeffects of aging set in, causing a slow decline that slidesirreversibly into death.   Medicine now stands helpless before this apparent design ofnature, he said.   In a study published today in the journal Science, Olshansky andtwo co-authors wrote that even if cures were found for most of thefatal diseases, ``the natural degeneration of the body puts a capof about 85 years on the average age of death.''   The conclusion differs from many other studies and some expertson human aging disagree strongly.   ``If we keep making progress as we have made in the past, then ababy born today can expect to live 100 years,'' said James Vaupelof the University of Minnesota. ``There may well be some biologicalbarriers, but we are spending a lot of money on biomedical researchand the sciences are poised to make some really significantbreakthroughs.''   Olshansky said most of the major advances in life expectancyhave already been achieved through improvements in public health,nutrition, immunization and advanced medical care. The average lifespan in the United States went from 47 years in 1900 to 75 yearstoday.   ``This trend is not likely to continue,'' Olshansky said. ``Theeasy advances have already been made.''   Death rates for the young and those under age 50 are now so lowthat even if all dying in that age group were eliminated, the lifeexpectancy at birth would increase by only 3.5 years, saidOlshansky. The major killers - heart disease, cancer, stroke anddiabetes - usually strike after the age of 50.   ``In order to increase the average life expectancy of thepopulation to just 85 years, we would have to achieve theequivalent of the elimination of all deaths from heart disease andcancer,'' Olshansky said. ``There are very few people around whoargue that is realistically possible.''   But even controlling the major killer diseases would have littlestatistical effect on the average life span, he said.   ``Just because we eliminate major fatal disease does not meanthat we will not grow older and die. It just means that we willgrow older and die of other diseases,'' he said.   ``Once you go beyond the age of 85, people die from multipleorgan failure. Old age, basically. And there is no cure for that,''Olshansky said. ``We don't know why we age. But it happens. Itaffects everyone. No matter what you do in terms of eliminatingthese diseases it's still going to happen.''   Vaupel said he believes the Olshansky study is too pessimistic.   ``We are beginning to gain a fundamental understanding of agingand we eventually may be able to slow down that process,'' he saidin a telephone interview. ``I don't see any evidence at all thatthere is a cap at 85.''   Vaupel said women in some populations already are approachinglife expectancies of 85. In Okinawa, the average life span of womennow is 83, and the life expectancy of women in some Mormon groupsis almost 85 now, he said. This was accomplished without majormedical intervention, he said.   Another researcher, Ken Manton of Duke University, said theOlshansky study is ``seriously flawed'' because it fails to takeinto account recent research that could push life expectancy ratesupward.   Manton said, for example, that medicine is now identifyingspecific disorders of aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, and isbeginning to search for cures. Such work is almost certain toenable people to live longer, he said.   Most experts agree that research should emphasize not justextending life, but how to make later years more free of disease.   ``The prospect now is that those added years will be cripplingyears,'' Olshansky said. ``It is possible to alter that course oflife by going after those crippling diseases. That's what we shouldbe doing.''   Olshansky said about 2 million Americans are over age 85, mostof whom require close attendance and care. If U.S. life expectancyrises to an average of 85, he said, then there will be about 16million people over that age.   Olshansky's co-authors were Bruce A. Carnes of the ArgonneNational Laboratory in Illinois and Christine Cassel of theUniversity of Chicago.</TEXT></DOC>
