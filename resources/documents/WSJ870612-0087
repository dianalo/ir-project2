The automation boom of the early 1980s has ushered in a host of unforeseen glitches in computerized systems. And some factory owners are relearning that humans perform certain tasks better than robots.    The result: A more cautious generation of plant owner.    Companies are automating in smaller doses now, a strategy that allows bugs to be worked out before huge investments are made. &quot;If you make 30 million boxes of Wheaties a year, you can use automation without many problems,&quot; says Andy Guarriello, an American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. engineering director in Shreveport, La. &quot;But if you're in a competitive market where the product is changing and its life cycle is short, you better be damned careful.&quot;    The current automation age began to take hold in the late 1970s. The problem was that factory operators didn't anticipate the roadblocks in dealing with the new technology, which required coordinating sophisticated machinery, computers and complicated software packages, as well as retraining employees.    The vision of fully automated plants &quot;had a lot of sex appeal because it sounded as if it could solve everyone's problems,&quot; says Vicki Brown, analyst with International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass.-based consulting firm. &quot;It was a pipedream.&quot;    Of course, automation is here to stay. U.S. factory operators are expected to increase outlays for automation an average 12% annually until 1991 from $16 billion last year, says Dataquest, a San Jose, Calif., market research concern.    What is changing is the way the technology is being applied.    ATandamp;T's Mr. Guarriello had the failures of other manufacturers in mind when he considered plans to modernize the company's outdated Shreveport plant last year. &quot;We wanted a world-class factory,&quot; to compete with overseas vendors, he recalls. &quot;So one of the first things we did was find out what 'world-class' was.&quot;    According to one consultant, that meant spending tens of millions of dollars on robots and other machines controlled by computers, Mr. Guarriello says. The proposed &quot;flexible&quot; system would have allowed the factory to lump tasks together and to make customized parts without delaying production. When the part is completed, the computer directs it to a storage area where it later is retrieved for the next step in the assembly process.    At one time, Mr. Guarriello might have blindly followed the consultant's recommendations. But he concluded that the plan went too far.    First, the Shreveport plant typically requires long manufacturing runs. So the system, which works best for plants that require short runs of many different products, would have been inefficient. In addition, the complicated software packages required for the plantwide project would have taken at least a year to implement.    &quot;We said while we're fiddling around spending all this money, (our competitors) are going to eat our lunch,&quot; Mr. Guarriello says.    Two months later, ATandamp;T completed the installation of a simpler system. A series of single-row manufacturing lines, on which products are assembled from scratch and shipped in about two hours, using much of the plant's existing equipment. Computerized robots are assigned only such basic, repetitive tasks as inserting parts into circuit boards or placing glue in phone handsets.    Companies that require more-complex computer systems and machinery also have changed their approach. These days, plants are being automated piece by piece, allowing for glitches to be corrected before the new process is rolled out.    &quot;Whenever you introduce a change, it creates surprises both positive and negative,&quot; says Alex Kisin, president of Netron Inc., a software development unit of Noma Industries Ltd. &quot;The easiest way is to take some independent part and (experiment) there. Then, based on the results, integrate it into other areas.&quot;    Four years ago, another Noma unit, Canadiana, installed robots on an assembly line that welded lawn mowers and snow blower parts. Because the test was limited, Canadiana's engineers were able to discover and correct problems that otherwise would have been disastrous for its sales.    For example: Welding robots, which pivoted to one side, weren't as productive as they could be. After welding a set of blades to the well of a snow blower, workers had to shut down the robot in order to reload the workstation.    A year later, the company's engineers solved the problem by placing the robots on tracks. The machines now move from one stack of parts to the next without halting production.    They also discovered another problem -- poorly made parts. Many times, they found, welding spots on certain parts didn't line up properly. That never stopped human welders. They would simply &quot;bend the product into shape or put the weld in another space,&quot; Mr. Kisin explains. &quot;The robot wouldn't.&quot;    If the entire plant was installed with such robots, he adds, the company's production schedule would have been disrupted. (Canadiana forced its vendors to make better parts.)    Meanwhile, many companies have found that humans can be more efficient than robots or other computerized devices.    McKesson Corp., a distributor of health-care products, uses computers extensively to take orders from customers. But warehouse workers still sort by hand the company's 30,000 different products, from eye liner to wheelchairs, says Douglas Thompson, a senior vice president. Because of &quot;the wide ranges of sizes and shapes, (the products) don't lend themselves well to automation,&quot; he says.    In another case, the maker of Winchester-brand guns, U.S. Repeating Arms Co. of New Haven, Conn., recently scrapped a spray-painting machine it bought three years ago. The device can varnish 600 gun stocks an hour. But it takes 90 minutes to recalibrate the machine when workers are ready to paint another type of gun stock. (The company makes seven sizes.)    &quot;We went back to hand painting,&quot; says William Saari, director of manufacturing. &quot;We had to queue up a week's worth of inventory to make a run worthwhile.&quot;    The $300,000 machine, he adds, is &quot;available for sale.&quot;    ---   Mr. Gilman reports on technology from The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau.    ---                     How Industry Uses Robots                       U.S. only, by task    Assembly                                     27%    Spot welding                                 23    Material handling, loading                   21    Arc welding                                  11    Painting, coating, finishing                  8    Other (includes machining)                   10    ---                        Robotics Spending                     World-wide, by industry                   (In millions of U.S. dollars)    Motor vehicle                                $1,050    Electrical, electronic                          450    Fabricated products and machinery               135    Aerospace                                       125    Chemical, petroleum                              38    Food, drug                                       20    Other                                            62    TOTAL SPENDING                               $1,880    Source: Dataquest Inc., 1986</TEXT></DOC>
