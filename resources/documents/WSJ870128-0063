Mr. Shultz, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also said that the Reagan administration may take actions to try to force U.S. citizens to leave Lebanon.    Mr. Shultz previously had disclosed that U.S. officials met secretly last month with Iranians. Yesterday, he told the committee that the meeting occurred Dec. 13 in Frankfurt, West Germany. He said President Reagan approved the meeting to deliver a message to the Iranians that &quot;any thought on their part that there were going to be further sales of arms was wrong.&quot; Mr. Shultz warned that any U.S. official who disobeys that decision &quot;is in deep trouble.&quot;    The U.S. participants in the meeting were Charles Dunbar, a State Department official, and George Cave, a retired Central Intelligence Agency official and Iran expert working on contract for the agency.    The secretary of state said that after the meeting Mr. Dunbar returned to the U.S., but that Mr. Cave remained and was invited to a second meeting by the Iranian representative. Mr. Cave attended the session without first notifying State Department officials about it, an action Mr. Shultz said he deemed &quot;inappropriate.&quot;    Mr. Shultz said the U.S. received some new information from the Iranians at the December session, and that he reported it immediately to President Reagan. The secretary of state didn't describe what the Iranians said, but he told the committee that Mr. Reagan was &quot;truly appalled and shocked by what I told him, as I was.&quot;    Last week, Mr. Shultz disclosed in closed-door testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the Iranians produced a nine-point &quot;draft agenda&quot; at the December meeting, according to sources. The Iranians reportedly said the agenda was known to the National Security Council. Among the agenda items were proposals to exchange four American hostages in Lebanon for about 1,000 TOW antitank missiles and the release of 17 Islamic Jihad terrorists jailed in Kuwait.    Mr. Shultz said last week that the State Department official at the meeting abruptly cut off the session after it became clear the Iranians were still interested in exchanging hostages for arms.    Mr. Shultz said yesterday that he believes closer ties are in the long-term interests of both the U.S. and Iran. But he expressed some skepticism concerning the motives of so-called moderates in Iran. He said that he believes that some Iranians are displeased with the bloody course of the Iran-Iraq war and the state of their country's economy. But he warned that Iranians are &quot;very bright, energetic and always looking for a deal.&quot;    He also said that Tehran's ability to continue conducting the war, despite the high casualties and the wrecking of its economy, shows that it is &quot;a strong government,&quot; adding: &quot;So the idea that somehow or other it's teetering, I don't see that.&quot;    Mr. Shultz also told the Senate committee yesterday that the U.S. recently has taken a number of diplomatic and military steps to bolster the confidence of its moderate Arab allies. He declined to specify any military actions, but Reagan administration sources said the Pentagon has ordered five ships of the Navy's Persian Gulf squadron into the northern end of the gulf in an effort to reassure Arab nations worried about possible Iranian aggression during an Islamic summit meeting in Kuwait this week.    The sources said three destroyers and two frigates on patrol in the central Persian Gulf were ordered to steam northward, and the command ship USS LaSalle was ordered into the gulf from the Arabian Sea after several Arab states expressed concern to U.S. officials about possible Iranian attempts to disrupt the summit or intimidate its participants.    In his testimony yesterday, Mr. Shultz said the Reagan administration is considering revoking or limiting passports to discourage U.S. citizens still in Lebanon from remaining there. President Reagan also could invoke emergency executive authority, as he did last year when he imposed economic sanctions against Libya, to order Americans to leave Lebanon.    There has been a rash of kidnappings in Beirut following the arrest in West Germany earlier this month of Mohammed Ali Hamadi, who is accused in the U.S. of murder and air piracy in connection with the 1985 hijacking of a U.S. airliner. The Reagan administration is seeking his extradition. Terrorist groups in Beirut have threatened to execute their hostages if the extradition takes place.    Yesterday, West German officials reportedly arrested Mr. Hamadi's brother, Abbas Hamadi. That could result in further kidnappings in Lebanon.    Mr. Shultz said there are about 1,500 U.S. citizens in Lebanon, the &quot;overwhelming bulk&quot; of whom are Lebanese with dual citizenship. Under U.S. law, the secretary of state has the authority to issue, limit or revoke passports. A department official said that violation of passport restrictions is a federal crime.    Mr. Shultz told the panel that at least seven and possibly 12 people, including three Americans, have been kidnapped in Lebanon since Mohammed Ali Hamadi's arrest Jan. 13. </TEXT></DOC>
