The growing belief that further U.S. cuts may beneeded added to the pressure on the U.S. unit, traders said.   But traders said the dollar's slide may have beenexaggerated by the thinness of dealings. When the marketisn't liquid, currencies can make sharp moves on largeindividual deals.</LP><TEXT>   The dollar fell to an intraday low of 1.5062 marks inmid-afternoon, a level not seen since Feb. 22, when thedollar was trading at 1.4835 marks. The dollar also hit anintraday low of 126.2 yen at about 2 p.m. New York time, alevel not seen since Oct. 22, 1990, when the dollar changedhands at 125.7 yen.   Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.515 marks,down from 1.5349 marks late Friday in New York. The U.S.currency also was changing hands at 126.75 yen, down from127.54 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.879, up from $1.8585.   In midmorning trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar wastrading at 127.05 yen, down from Friday's Tokyo close at128.32 yen. The U.S. currency was trading at 1.5170 marks,down from 1.5570 marks at the close of Friday trading inTokyo.   &quot;Everything you read, hear, and see&quot; points to the dollarmoving lower by the year's end on interest rate differentialsand U.S. economic fundamentals, said Don Quattrucci, a traderat Connecticut National Bank in Hartford.   Traders said there is support for the dollar at 1.5 marksbut disagree over whether that level will hold if tested.   Below that psychological level, traders said technicalchart support exists initially at 1.485 marks and then at1.4725 marks.   Traders said the widening interest rate differentials areprimarily responsible for the dollar's plunge in the lastthree days.   And traders said the market has shed the once-prevailingnotion that Friday's interest rate cut would be the last.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater praised the FederalReserve for cutting interest rates and said that &quot;there isroom for declining interest rates&quot; without stirring up a newround of inflation.   Mr. Fitzwater also hinted that rates could fall further.&quot;We'll leave it to the Fed to make those kinds of judgments&quot;about whether rates could be cut more, he said. &quot;But we thinkthey're on the right track.&quot;   &quot;We believe there is room for declining interest rates,and we won't try to dictate that at this point,&quot; Mr.Fitzwater said.   But current interest rate differentials alone continued togenerate dollar sales, traders were quick to add.   Friday's unexpectedly sharp U.S. rate cut followed a steepGerman interest rate increase Thursday, sharply boosting theprofits investors can make on mark-denominated investmentscompared with their dollar-denominated counterparts, traderssaid.   The U.S. unit has lost 3.7% against the mark from its1.5715-mark level late Wednesday, its latest New York levelbefore the German rate increase.   The Bundesbank action brought the country's key Lombardinterest rate to 9.75% from 9.25%. Although the Germancentral bank also raised its discount rate to 8% from 7.5%,traders said the Lombard increase was the primary cause ofthe dollar's precipitous slide Thursday.   The Lombard rate acts as a cap on German overnight banklending rates.   The mark-buying binge continued Friday, when the U.S.Federal Reserve cut its discount rate, the rate at which theFed lends to commercial banks, by a full percentage point to3.5% from 4.5%, and cut the federal funds rate to 4% from4.25%.   The federal funds rate, the rate at which banks makeovernight loans to each other, is roughly analogous to Germanovernight lending rates.   German overnight interbank lending rates were at 9.5% to9.6% yesterday, more than five percentage points above theU.S. federal funds rate.   Traders said they expect the Fed to wait until the releaseof December employment data, scheduled for Jan. 10, beforemaking further rate cuts.   Market attention has been focused on the U.S. employmentsituation since the release in early December of a stunning241,000-job decline in November non-farm payrolls.   The mark also rose against the yen, trading at 83.71 yenlate yesterday in New York, up from 83.15 yen late Friday.But the German currency's strength against the French francand Italian lira was muted by interest rate increases inFrance and Italy.   France raised its key intervention rate to 9.60% from9.25% and the 5-to-10-day repo rate by half a percentagepoint, while Italy raised its discount rate half a point to12%.   The moves came to stem the selling of the French andItalian currencies against the mark, traders said. Thecentral banks of the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Austriaand Ireland had already raised interest rates in reaction tothe Bundesbank action.   The mark was trading at 758.1 lire late yesterday, downfrom 759.94 lire Friday, and was worth 3.418 francs, downfrom 3.4195 francs late Friday in New York.   The British central bank, however, chose to leave itsrates unchanged, leading the market to speculate that thecentral bank will be forced to intervene in the market tosupport its currency.   Sterling was trading at 2.8475 marks yesterday, down from2.8509 marks late Friday in New York.   The Bank of Spain also raised rates, increasing its dailyassistance rate to 12.75% from 12.5% and its overnightrepurchase rate to 12.45% from 12.2%, but left its keybenchmark intervention rate unchanged at 12.5%.</TEXT></DOC>
