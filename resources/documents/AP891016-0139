The formal report to the Supreme Soviet legislature, which wastelevised on national TV, was the latest twist in the tale ofYeltsin, a highly popular politician who pokes fun at the Sovietelite.   Rumors that Yeltsin died were rampant in Moscow when hedisappeared from public view for two weeks shortly after beingaccused in print of drinking and shopping his way through anAmerican speaking tour. But Yeltsin reappeared on Sunday and told arally he'd been recovering from a cold.   Bakatin told the Supreme Soviet that Yeltsin had reported to apoliceman that he had been assaulted and thrown into the MoscowRiver with a bag over his head. Yeltsin supposedly escaped butasked the policeman not to report the incident.   Investigation proved this untrue, Bakatin said. For example, hesaid, no one could have fallen 50 feet into 5 feet of water at thebridge in question without suffering injuries.   Yeltsin told Bakatin on Sept. 30, two days after the allegedincident, that the policeman misunderstood a joke. On Monday, hehad to tell the Supreme Soviet and the entire nation.   The official Tass news agency said, ``Mikhail Gorbachev, whopresided over the afternoon session, said the need to clear up thematter was caused by political speculations in connection with thealleged attempt.''   Bakatin said the report showed Yeltsin told police at 11:10 p.m.on Sept. 28 that he let his driver go two hours earlier, about athird of a mile from his home, and was walking the rest of the way.   ``Yeltsin said that a car overtook him and unknown persons madehim get into the car, pulled a bag over his head and, on reaching abridge across the Moscow River, threw him into the water.   ``Yeltsin said he managed to reach the bank, rested to regainhis breath and then turned to the militia. However, he asked themilitia people not to let anyone know what had happened,''according to the Tass account.   ``Noting that the militia men had no right to withhold thereport, Bakatin said that legal action was started to establish theobjective circumstances behind the statement made by Yeltsin as itreferred to a criminal case involving an attempt on a person's life.   ``The investigation established that the circumstances containedin the statement by Boris Yeltsin could not be confirmed.''   It said Yeltsin told Bakatin on Sept. 30 ``in a person-to-persontalk that there ... had been no attempt on his life. ... Thecriminal case was called off.''   ``In his address, Deputy Yeltsin reiterated that there had beenno attempt on his life,'' Tass said.</TEXT></DOC>
