In the spirit of the charitableseason, however, let's honor those whose creative energieshave challenged the law as it had been understood. Herewithentries for the most brilliantly frivolous legal argument ofthe year.   There was the lawyer who sued Huntington Beach, Calif., asa RICO racketeer after police there gave him three speedingtickets. Other cases that have appeared in this space includea Tennessee couple who sued a hospital for $4 million whentheir newborn was temporarily and harmlessly dyed blue by amedical procedure, then called a &quot;Smurfette&quot; by a nurse,allegedly causing &quot;distressing and permanent emotionaldamage.&quot; And the federal prosecutors who forced a broker tospend nearly a year in jail before federal judges announcedthat being a fourth-hand tippee of insider informationviolated no law because no such law exists.</LP><TEXT>   Also consider the New York City man who fell drunk on asubway track. He lost his arm when he was hit by a subwaytrain, so naturally sued the city's transit system fordamages. A jury decided that the accident wasn't his fault,that a subway worker should have noticed his inebriated stateand forced him off the platform. The award for $9.3 millionwas reversed by a party-pooping judge, who announced that the&quot;jury acted irrationally.&quot;   Then there is the case that wins the special-awardcategory of Whose Ox Is Suing? showing that the corporationthat complains about excessive litigation might be the nextplaintiff to gore another corporate defendant with arule-breaking lawsuit. In Travelers Insurance v. BudgetRent-a-Car, a parking valet for a restaurant in Maui causedan accident involving a rental car. The valet was not coveredby the Budget rental agreement that limited the number ofauthorized drivers. Travelers paid the claim on behalf of therestaurant, but then tried to collect from Budget. Theargument was that despite the clear language about who was anauthorized driver and who was not, judges should interpretthe contract as implying that a valet is covered.   Los Angeles federal appeals Judge Alex Kozinski would havenone of it. Contracts such as the rental agreement &quot;areuseful only insofar as each side can count on being able tohold the other to the terms of the agreement.&quot; The problem,Judge Kozinski wrote, is that &quot;increasing uncertainty throughjudicial meddling raises insurers' costs of doing business;inevitably those costs are passed on to customers.&quot;   The sharp-eyed Judge Kozinski noted that Travelers hadtaken the opposite view of the law in a similar case in NewYork in the 1970s where Allstate sued Travelers -- and,surprisingly, won. &quot;While parties are free to argue on goodfaith whatever position they deem advantageous in aparticular case,&quot; Judge Kozinski said, &quot;we doubt that such amyopic litigation strategy contributes to the healthydevelopment of the law or serves the long-term interest ofthose whose livelihood depends upon certainty andpredictability in the enforcement of commercial contracts.&quot;   These cases make honorable runnersup, but the envelopeplease. The winner of the most frivolous case is Carroll v.Otis Elevator, where Chicago federal appeals court JudgeFrank Easterbrook began his opinion with these enticingwords: &quot;Those seeking to burlesque modern products liabilitylaw could do no better than to examine this case.&quot;   Here goes. A clerk for a department store in downstateIllinois was injured on an escalator when a child played aprank by pressing the emergency stop button. The storereimbursed the clerk for her medical expenses and lost wagesunder the workers' compensation law, but she also sued Otisfor her pain and suffering. Her argument was that Otis shouldhave known better than to put a bright-red emergency buttonon each end of the escalator.   There is a reason escalator manufacturers make emergencystop buttons easy to find and press. They know that clothingor fingers, especially of children, sometimes get caught inthe moving stairs. A quickly pressed button can avoidinjuries and even death. So buttons should be easy forchildren to press, but common sense is no defense in today'scourtroom.   &quot;For reasons best known to itself,&quot; Judge Easterbrooknoted, Otis limited its appeal to the narrow issue of whetherthe trial judge erred by letting the plaintiff call an expertwitness to say that brightly colored buttons will enticemischief. Otis lost the appeal. It was perhaps out ofexasperation with the Monty Pythonness of the legal argumentshere that Judge Easterbrook inserted into his opinion thevisual illusion reproduced nearby. The lines separating thecubes don't look parallel, but they are; in principle, anexpert could show that children are somehow lured to pressbright escalator buttons.   Judge Easterbrook, a former University of Chicago lawprofessor, wrote that the real outrage with this case wasmore fundamental than silly expert testimony: &quot;Why shouldescalator design be a question for juries?&quot; Even with thehelp of experts, juries and judges aren't likely to design abetter escalator. Easily found buttons might lead to rarefalse stops, but will also help avoid more serious injuries.&quot;The ex post perspective of litigation exerts a hydraulicforce that distorts judgment,&quot; Judge Easterbrook wrote.&quot;Jurors see today's injury; persons who would be injured ifbuttons were harder to find and use are invisible.&quot; Aplaintiff wins but the losers are those who &quot;must pay higherprices, who will be deprived of beneficial products or whowill be injured in turn if manufacturers change their designsto be jury-proof.&quot;   The jury decided that Otis should pay some $43,000 indamages. Yet no one expects Otis to change itsemergency-button design, which meets or exceeds industrystandards. Despite the judgment against it, Judge Easterbrookwrote that &quot;Otis won't (and shouldn't) color its emergencystop buttons blue, or even pink; it won't (and shouldn't)make them harder to push, or put them five feet off the floorwhere toddlers can't reach them.&quot;   Instead, he said, this is another case where judges imposeliability &quot;where they have never done before.&quot; Hardexperience shows that assessing liability where there is nofault raises prices but also that the legal system rarelyacknowledges its own excesses. Judge Easterbrook concludedhis opinion with the hope inspired by so many cases thesedays, that &quot;state judges who are tomorrow's pathfinders willtake these comments as a skeptical report from the front.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
