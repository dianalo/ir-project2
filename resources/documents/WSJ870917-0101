Russell research center here are leading the quest for a salmonella-free chicken. But despite two decades of effort, the salmonella swat team has made scant progress.    Setbacks have been so numerous that the researchers are willing to try just about anything. Their latest ideas, which are being closely watched by the poultry industry, include genetic manipulation, ultrasound treatments, vaccinations, stress reduction --- even diapering the birds.    As Nelson Cox, a microbiologist on the research team, describes the quest: &quot;This is probably as elusive as the cure for the common cold.&quot;    Salmonella bacteria remain a serious problem in the U.S. food supply, accounting for about two million cases of food poisoning in humans annually and, sometimes, even death. While no one knows how many salmonella cases come from contaminated chickens, industry and government officials recognize the birds as a major source of the bacteria.    In the chicken world, salmonella rules the roost. It abounds in feed, water and litter. When the bacteria colonize the gut of one bird, they often spread to others, because chickens are coprophagous -- they consume one another's wastes.    The industry's methods make the problem even worse: During processing, there are up to 50 points where contact among chickens can spread the bacteria. According to a recent report by the National Academy of Sciences, only 1% to 4% of chickens typically arrive at a slaughterhouse infected with salmonella, but about 35% of all birds depart contaminated.    Some critics blame the large number of tainted birds reaching market partly on the government's poultry-inspection system, which monitors chickens for aesthetic flaws and obvious diseases but not for bacterial contamination. The Agriculture Department says it is considering changing its system.    Other critics say chicken processors haven't allocated adequate resources to the problem, even as Americans eat more chickens than ever -- some eight billion birds a year. &quot;If there is a public-health problem in the food supply, this is it, but the industry has invested minuscule dollars in the last 20 years to try to deal with it,&quot; says Thomas Grumbly, president of the Cambridge, Mass.-based Health Effects Institute and member of a National Academy of Sciences committee on meat and poultry inspection.    Earlier this year, however, media reports alerted chicken eaters to the existence of the bacteria on many uncooked birds. The chicken industry immediately cried foul, arguing that the salmonella count on chickens is no higher now than previously or than on other raw meat products, and that the bacteria pose no threat if the birds are properly handled and cooked.    But faced with the public outcry, the industry feels growing pressure to make breakthroughs. &quot;Since salmonella is a real concern for consumers, we must be able to say we are doing something to help control and minimize the problem,&quot; says Mahlon Burnette, technical adviser to the National Broiler Council, the industry's trade group. Frank Perdue, chairman of Perdue Farms Inc., vows, &quot;Salmonella is at the top of my company's list of priorities.&quot;    So, the government's scientists have become big draws on the industry's rubberchicken circuit. Phillip Hudspeth, vice president of research and quality assurance at Holly Farms Foods Inc. in Wilkesboro, N.C., says, &quot;We are all taking our leads&quot; from the Athens team.    For most of the 1970s, the government scientists dunked chicken carcasses into all manner of salmonella-killing chemicals -- in vain. Vinegar gives chickens an acrid smell. Succinic acid turns their skins brown and parchment-thin. A dash of hydrogen peroxide bloats chickens like balloons. Chlorine remains the most effective chemical to kill salmonella in the water of sprayers and chilling tanks, but it doesn't kill bacteria on chicken carcasses.    In the early 1980s, the scientists developed a special steam technology designed to kill salmonella in feed. The poultry industry wasn't interested, in part because it found the technology too costly.    Now the scientists are focusing mainly on purging salmonella from the innards of live birds. &quot;If you deliver a salmonella-free flock to the processing plant, there are no salmonella to spread around, and you've solved the problem,&quot; says Roy Blankenship, research leader of the government team in Athens.    One approach involves a notion called competitive exclusion. The Athens scientists feed day-old chicks brews made up of certain &quot;good&quot; bacteria isolated from the salmonella-free feces of adult chickens. By coating the intestines of newborns, the group most susceptible to salmonella, the scientists hope to leave no &quot;parking spaces&quot; for salmonella.    While preliminary results are encouraging, the researchers say their laboratory brews don't fight salmonella as effectively as when chicks are fed salmonella-free chicken feces. Using natural wastes, however, raises the risk of infecting chicks with worse things than salmonella.    In addition, competitive exclusion has met tough times down on the farm. Campbell Soup Co. has tried administering anti-salmonella potions to chickens for the past few years at its poultry-processing plant in Fayetteville, Ark. The trouble, Campbell says, is that salmonella is so ubiquitous in a chicken's environment that the limited numbers of good bacteria can't occupy enough parking places to shut out all the salmonella pouring into a chicken's gut.    Other approaches have other problems. The Athens researchers are trying to develop a salmonella vaccine -- a challenge because the bacteria don't actually make chickens sick. The scientists also want to develop genetically manipulated birds, but there is only limited evidence that certain bird lines are more resistant to salmonella than others.    Another possiblity is keeping chickens calm, cool and collected. The scientists know that stressed-out chickens are more likely to get salmonella. Their next step is to determine which factors -- such as water and feed deprivation or temperature variations -- actually make poultry more prone to the infection.    The Food and Drug Administration, meanwhile, is considering whether to let the industry bombard dead chickens with gamma rays. This process, called irradiation, would effectively zap salmonella and other organisms. Some specialists argue, however, that it would provide a happy hunting ground for even more virulent bacteria should the sterilized birds get recontaminated. Consumer resistance is another drawback. &quot;People fear irradiated products will make them glow in the dark,&quot; says Mr. Cox, the microbiologist.    In the absence of easy answers, one thing is certain: Poultry companies will be throwing ever-increasing amounts of chlorine at their chickens. &quot;I'm getting calls constantly from people in the industry asking, 'What do you suggest?'&quot; says Stanley Bailey, another microbiologist on the government's team. &quot;It's frustrating, but besides chlorine, there isn't much more I know to tell them.&quot;    Indeed, so great is the frustration that the government's Mr. Blankenship is seriously considering diapering the birds. At processing plants, chickens are stunned electrically while hanging from their claws, and then their throats are slit. This sometimes produces in chickens what the industry genteelly terms &quot;involuntary defecation.&quot; Mr. Blankenship's solution: outfitting the birds with a &quot;vent plug.&quot; He says, &quot;You have to let your imagination soar in this business.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
