The missile, called the M-11, is believed to have a rangeof about 180 miles and the capability of carrying a &quot;heavypayload,&quot; according to one official who asked not to beidentified.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There are indications of a substantial amount of activitybetween China and Pakistan relating to this missile. I can'tsay whether or not there is a record of actual delivery,&quot;added the official.   He said that the U.S. has protested to both nations and toother nations in the region. Spokesmen for the embassies ofChina and Pakistan in Washington weren't available forimmediate comment. A spokesman for the Indian embassy said,&quot;The introduction of sophisticated weapons in ourneighborhood is a matter of deep concern for us.&quot;   The new activity presents a difficult problem for the Bushadministration, which has been trying to persuade the Chinesenot to violate the new Missile Technology Control Regime, anagreement between some supplier nations that they won't sellmissiles that have a range of more than 300 kilometers (186miles).   Because the range of China's new missile could beincreased if its payload is reduced, U.S. officials believethat could exceed the limits of the agreement. China hasn'tformally approved the treaty but has assured the U.S. thatits policies concerning the sale of missile technology willbe &quot;prudent and responsible.&quot;   In December, on the same day he promised new efforts onthe nonproliferation front, President Bush approved the saleof a powerful U.S. computer to China. Powerful computers aremajor tools used to design both missiles and bombs. The saleappeared to be a sign of U.S. faith in China's policies.   &quot;This shows first of all that China is basically out ofcontrol on exports despite all of the assurances we'vereceived,&quot; said Gary Milhollin, who heads the WisconsinProject, a Washington-based research effort to trace theproliferation of nuclear weapons and related missiletechnology. &quot;And it could spur India's own ballistic missileprogram to a higher level of activity,&quot; he added.   Pakistani officials repeatedly have denied they possessnuclear weapons, but the Bush administration cut off militaryaid to Pakistan in October, saying it could no longer giveassurances, required by U.S. law, that Pakistan doesn't havenuclear weapons.   The Pakistani weapons program, according to U.S. experts,is centered around a process for enriching uranium that itsecretly stole from a facility in Europe. While Pakistan hasU.S.-built F-16 fighters, which can carry nuclear weapons,the addition of a missile capable of carrying a nuclearwarhead would substantially increase its ability to threatenits neighbors, since most countries have no defense againstballistic missiles.   Earlier, China said that reports it was planning to sellto Syria a longer-range missile, the M-9, were &quot;utterlygroundless.&quot; Both the M-9 and the M-11 are regarded as muchmore worrisome than the Soviet-built Scud missiles used inthe Gulf War, because the Chinese missiles are believed to bemuch more accurate and reliable.   China sold anti-ship &quot;Silkworm&quot; missiles to both Iran andIraq during the war between the two nations. In 1987, Chinatook a further step by selling 36 intermediate-rangeballistic missiles, with a range of 1,500 miles, to SaudiArabia.   According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, whichrecently published a study of China's missile and nuclearweapons capability, there have been persistent reports thatChina has been giving advice, possibly including atom-bombdesigns, to Pakistan's nuclear program.   China received massive injections of nuclear technologyfrom the Soviet Union in the 1950s, which the study calls&quot;history's largest case of nuclear proliferation.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
