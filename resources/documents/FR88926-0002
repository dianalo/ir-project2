Background </ITAG>The Program was established in 1977 to assist institutions and the publicin tracking and deterring trafficking in lost, stolen, missing and counterfeitsecurities.\5\<NOTE/> The Commission established the Program to provide a centralfacilities manager to whom Program participants report and inquire aboutmissing, lost, counterfeit and stolen securities certificates. The database currently is operated by the Securities Information Center (``SIC'')in Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts,\6\<NOTE/> which was designated by the Commission to receive and processreports and inquiries of missing securities.\7\<NOTE/> When a securities certificate comes into the possession ofa Program participant, the Program participant must make an inquiry toSIC to determine whether the securities certificate previously was reportedlost, missing, counterfeit or stolen. When an inquiry into the system matchesa missing, lost, counterfeit or stolen security report, commonly referredto as a ``hit,'' SIC provides the inquiring financial institution withthe name, address and telephone number of the institution that reportedthe loss. The institution that reported the loss also is notified, as isthe Federal Bureau of Investigation (``FBI'') if there are any indicationsthat potential criminal activity may be involved. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ In 1975, section 17(f)(1) was adopted as part of the SecuritiesActs Amendments of 1975. <T3>See</T3> Pub. L. No. 94-29 (June 5, 1975). That Section granted theCommission broad rulemaking authority to establish procedures for reportingand inquiring about missing, lost, stolen and counterfeit securities. Pursuantto this authority the Commission adopted Rule 17f-1 in 1976. See SecuritiesExchange Act Release Nos. 13053 (December 10, 1976), 41 FR 54923 and 15867(May 23, 1979), 44 FR 31501. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ SIC is operated by Autex Systems, a subsidiary of theInternational Thomson Organization, Inc. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ As of December 31, 1986, this data base contained informationon securities certificates with a market value of approximately $12 billion.The approximately 20,000 Program participants include, among others, brokers;dealers; members of the Federal Reserve System; banks whose deposits areinsured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; registered transferagents; members of national securities exchanges; registered clearing agencies;and participants of registered clearing agencies. When program participants do not comply with Rule 17f-1, they not onlyundermine the effectiveness of the Program, but also incur risk of financiallosses they otherwise might avoid. Inquiry assures participants that securitiesin their possession have not been reported as missing, lost, counterfeitor stolen. Without inquiry, the program participant or its customers couldgive value for securities that were missing, lost, counterfeit and stolensecurities. Rule 17f-1 was last amended in 1979. Since that time, the Commission andthe financial institutions that use the Program have gained important experiencewith the Program. The Commission believes that it is now appropriate toreassess the scope, costs and benefits of the Program and the requirementsof Rule 17f-1. A discussion of the proposed amendments, commentators' suggestionsand the adopted amendments follows. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. The Amendments</ITAG>A. Reporting Institutions The Commission is adopting an amendment to the definition of the term ``reportinginstitution'' to clarify that government securities brokers and dealersare required to register with SIC and must comply with the reporting andinquiry provisions of the Rule. The Commission believes that this amendmentto the definition of reporting institution should eliminate any confusionabout the application of Rule 17f-1's requirements to government securitiesbrokers and dealers.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Section 17(f)(1) of the Act and Rule 17f-1 thereunderalways have mandated Program registration for all brokers and dealers,including government securities brokers and dealers as well as municipalbrokers and dealers, regardless of whether they are registered with theCommission as broker-dealers. Moreover, section 102 of the Government SecuritiesAct specifically requires that government securities brokers and dealersparticipate in the Program. <T3>See </T3>Government Securities Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-571. The Commission also believes it is appropriate at this time, in light ofthe recent increase in regulation of the government securities marketsand the internationalization of the securities markets, to remind the industryof the scope of the definition of ``reporting institution.'' For example,foreign branch offices of a registered broker-dealer are reporting institutions.\9\<NOTE/> In addition, all participants in registered clearing agenciesare ``reporting institutions'' under the Rule.\10\<NOTE/> Thus, mortgage bankers that may become members of the recentlyregistered MBS Clearing Corporation are reporting institutions and, unlessan exemption is available, will be required to register with SIC. Similarly,non-U.S. entities that are participants of registered clearing agencieswill be required to register with SIC and make appropriate inquiries andreports.\11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Foreign affiliates of registered broker-dealers are notreporting institutions merely by virtue of their affiliation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Section 3(a)(24) of the Act defines a clearing agencyparticipant to be ``any person who uses a clearing agency to clear or settlesecurities transactions or to transfer, pledge, lend, or hypothecate securities.Such term does not include a person whose only use of a clearing agencyis (A) through another person who is a participant or (B) as a pledgeeof securities.'' This definition encompasses certain entities, particularlysavings and loan institutions, that, except for their membership in a registeredclearing agency, would not be deemed reporting institutions under the Rule.The Commission also believes it is foreseeable that other institutionsthat are not otherwise ``reporting institutions'' (for example, insurancecompanies and pension funds) some day may become direct participants inone or more registered depositories, making them reporting institutionsfor purposes of the Program.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Rule 17f-1(d)(1)(ii) provides an exemption from inquiryfor securities received directly from another reporting institution. Thus,non-U.S. entities that are subject to Rule 17f-1 because they are clearingparticipants could avail themselves of that inquiry exemption for securitiesthey receive from registered U.S. clearing agencies or other ``reportinginstitutions'' such as U.S. broker-dealers. No exemption generally wouldbe available, however, for securities that U.S. broker-dealers or clearingagencies receive from non-U.S. entities that are not ``reporting institutions''and they thus would be required to inquire on those certificates. B. Exemptionsfrom Program Registration The Commission proposed several amendments to the Rule 17f-1 registrationexemptions.\12\<NOTE/> Specifically, the Commission proposed to replace the exemptionfor broker-dealers that engage solely in the sale of variable contractsor limited partnership interests and that do not take or hold securitiessubject to the reporting and inquiry provisions of the Rule with a morefunctional exemption that takes into account the increasing immobilizationof securities. The Commission is adopting the proposed amendments, whichexempt any reporting institution whose securities activities involve exclusivelyuncertificated securities issues, global securities issues or securitiesissues for which neither record nor beneficial owners can obtain negotiablesecurities certificates (``functionally uncertificated issues''). The Commissionbelieves that it is appropriate to exempt these entities from participationin the Program for the reasons discussed in the Proposal Release. Expressedsimply, the basis for these amendments is that uncertificated securitiescannot be lost or stolen in a manner that can be detected through the Program.The Commission also is adopting the proposed definitions of the terms ``uncertificatedsecurity'' and ``global certificate securities issues.'' No commentatorsobjected to these amendments; six supported them.\13\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ <T3>See </T3>Rule 17f-1(b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ <T3>See </T3>comments of ABA, Autex, Continental Bank, ISA, SIA and SovranBank. This exemption is expected to apply infrequently because few institutionsdeal exclusively in uncertificated issues. Moreover, under this definition,if an exempt institution accepts a single securities certificate for anyreason, it loses its exemption and must register with SIC.\14\<NOTE/> The Commission expects that an institution that loses itsexemption under these circumstances would remain registered for at leastsix months.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ For example, the Commission understands that, if an issuerof a global security issue were to default, physical certificates wouldbe issued to all registered owners. In that event, any reporting institutionhandling that issue that previously claimed an exemption from registrationbecause its business was limited to functionally uncertificated issueswould lose its exemption and would be required to register with SIC. Although this exemption currently has limited applicability, it may becomeincreasingly important as uncertificated securities become more widelyaccepted.\15\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that an increasing number of securitiesissues will be available in book-entry-only form in the future as the increasedcost savings and processing efficiencies resulting from immobilizationare recognized. Additionally, the Commission believes that investors willbecome receptive to securities issues that do not provide negotiable certificatesas evidence of ownership. At that time, the Commission expects that a largernumber of reporting institutions will be able to take advantage of thisexemption from registration.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Examples of instutions that currently may be able toclaim the exemption are broker-dealers that handle only limited partnershipinterests, mutual funds that do not permit investors to obtain negotiablecertificates and the Options Clearing Corporation, which deals exclusivelywith uncertificated options.The Commission also is adopting an amendment to exempt any reporting institutionwhose business activities never include the handling of securities certificates,including, among other things, safekeeping, pledge, purchase, transfer,redemption or sale. The Commission believes this amendment properly exemptscertain securities firms, that, because of the nature of their business,never have occasion to inquire of, or report to, SIC. For example, theCommission understands that there are some broker-dealers, self-styled``mergers and acquisition specialists,'' whose business is strictly limitedto bringing together potential buyers and sellers of businesses. In thepast, these institutions have been required to register as reporting institutions.The Commission believes, however, that because these firms do not haveoccasion to handle securities certificates, they should not be subjectto the Rule's reporting and inquiry provisions; nor should they be requiredto register with SIC and pay the attendant fees. A securities firm thatclaims an exemption from registration under this provision must realize,however, that if it accepts even one securities certificate for processing,however, even on an accommodation basis, it will be required to registerwith SIC and otherwise to participate in the program for at least six months.The Commission also is amending the exemption from registration for membersof national securities exchanges who effect securities transactions exclusivelyon the floor of the exchange solely for other members and who do not receiveor hold customer securities. The amendment deletes the phrase ``solelyfor other members'' from the Rule to codify Commission interpretationsthat floor brokers, floor traders and specialists are exempt from registration.\1\\6\<NOTE/> The Commission received no comments opposing this amendmentand received five comments favoring it.\1\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ Although the amendment may exempt these entities fromregistration, they would continue to be ``reporting institutions'' underthe Rule. Thus, other reporting institutions will not be burdened withdetermining whether these exempt entities are reporting institutions forpurposes of the inquiry exemption in Rule 17f-1(d)(1)(ii). It also is significantthat these entities, as ``reporting institutions,'' are required by Rule17f-1 to report to SIC any securities which are lost, stolen or discoveredto be missing or counterfeit while in their possession. Practically speaking,of course, these broker-dealers rarely will need to make reports, becausethey almost never hold securities certificates. Should the need to makea report arise, however, the Commission's designee has established proceduresfor what it calls ``permissive reports'' that floor traders, floor brokersand specialists should use.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ <T3>See </T3>comments of American Bankers Association, ABA, ContinentalBank, SIA and Sovran Bank.The amendment also substitutes the phrase ``through the trading facilitiesof the exchange'' for the phrase ``on the floor of the exchange'' to clarifythat members that use the Intermarket Trading System and other inter-marketlinkages will not lose the protection of the exemption.C. Reporting Requirements<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Reports to the Commission or SIC</ITAG>When making reports to the Commission or SIC under Rule 17f-1(c), reportinginstitutions must file Form X-17F-1A. The Commission is concerned thatmany Program participants are not using the appropriate check-off box onForm X-17F-1A to indicate, when appropriate, that certificates were lostin the U.S. mails. It is essential that participants indicate on theirreports to SIC when a mail loss has occurred. That indication enables promptnotification to the Postal Service of losses that are under its investigativejurisdiction. Because Rule 17f-1(c)(5) has not previously been conformedto clarify that participants must indicate on Form X-17F-1A that a mailloss occurred, if appropriate, the Commission has adopted a technical conformingamendment to make clear Program participants' responsibility to use themail-loss check-off box.\1\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\In a similar vein, the Commission reminds participantsthat they should include on Form X-17F-1A as accurate as possible a dollarvalue for the securities they are reporting.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Reports to Appropriate Law Enforcement Agencies</ITAG>Prior to these amendments, Rule 17f-1(c) required all reporting institutions,in cases where potential criminal activity was indicated, to notify notonly SIC, but also the ``appropriate law enforcement agency,'' within specifiedtime frames. The Commission proposed to amend the Rule's reporting requirementsby adding a definition of the phrase ``appropriate law enforcement agency''to codify prior Commission policy.The Commission has decided not to adopt the definition as proposed.19<NOTE/>Although several commentators agreed that clarification ofProgram participants' reporting responsibilities was needed, only one commentator,the Internal Security Association/Financial Firms, specifically agreedwith the proposed definition. Many of the commentators argued that requiringup to three duplicate reports to various law enforcement agencies, as theproposed amendment would have done in some cases, would be overly burdensomeon reporting institutions. Moreover, these commentators believed that theproposed definition was too complex and would have led to more, ratherthan less, confusion about participants' reporting responsibilities.20<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>19The Commission proposed to define the phrase ``appropriatelaw enforcement agency'' to mean one or more of the following: (1) Thelocal police, sheriff or similar authority in all cases involving counterfeiting,loss or theft, where there is substantial basis for believing criminalactivity was involved; (2) the Federal Bureau of Investigation (``FBI'')in all cases involving counterfeiting, loss or theft, where there is substantialbasis for believing criminal activity was involved: (a) of any securityin excess of $5,000 or (b) regardless of market value, of any securityfrom a federally insured bank or of any security which is a direct obligationof, or guarantee as to principal and interest by, the United States, orany security issued or guaranteed by a corporation in which the UnitedStates has a direct or indirect interest; and (3) the United States SecretService in all cases involving the theft, loss or counterfeiting of anysecurity which is a direct obligation of, or guaranteed by, a corporationin which the United States has a direct or indirect interest.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>20<T3>See </T3>generally comments of ABA, American Transtech, Bank of America,CBA, Continental Bank, Hospital Trust, Morgan Bank, SIA, STA and UnionBank.   The Commission agrees that the proposed definition could have imposed duplicativeadministrative and financial burdens on Program participants. The Commissioninstead has decided to amend Rule 17f-1 to require reporting institutionsto report only to SIC and the FBI the theft, counterfeiting or loss ofsecurities where there is a substantial basis for believing criminal activitymay be involved. After review, the Commission has concluded that mandatingreports solely to SIC and the FBI can reasonably be expected to lead tonotification of all interested law enforcement agencies through referralthrough the FBI's National Crime Information Center (``NCIC'') and throughother FBI referrals.21<NOTE/>Thus, all law enforcement agencies should receive prompt notificationof criminal activity within their jurisdiction and reporting institutionswill be spared the burdens of determining whom to notify and of makingmultiple notifications.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>21Furthermore, certain law enforcement agencies have accessto SIC's database through computer terminals linked to SIC's computers(<T3>see infra </T3>note <T3>22</T3>).   Program participants should realize that the Commission's decision to requirethat reports be made solely to SIC and the FBI does not in any way affectProgram participants' independent notification obligations under otherstatutes, rules or regulations. Further, the Commission believes that,as a matter of good business practice, participants should continue routinelyto report to the police and all federal law enforcement agencies with jurisdictionall losses where potential criminal activity may be indicated.22<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>22The Commission believes the proposed definition, thoughnot adopted, serves as a useful guide for reporting institutions. <T3>See supra </T3>note <T3>18</T3>.   As an alternative to its proposed definition, the Commission requestedcomment on the advisability of centralizing in SIC the responsibility forreporting losses and thefts to appropriate law enforcement agencies. Fourcommentators, Autex, Bank of America, SIA and Sovran Bank, responded favorably,stating that centralizing reporting in SIC would ease the burden on Programparticipants and most likely would ensure that all interested law enforcementagencies would receive prompt notification of losses and thefts withintheir jurisdiction. The Commission has determined, however, that, becausethere is no centralized reporting mechanism to which SIC could make reports,it might be overly burdensome and costly for SIC to assume Program participants'reporting responsibilities. Moreover, because this reporting obligationis limited to cases of potential criminal activity, the Commission believesit is sensible that the reporting institution involved have a direct obligationto notify a law enforcement agency. Therefore, the Commission has decidednot to centralize law enforcement agency reporting in SIC at this time.23<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>23Although SIC has provided several regional offices of theFBI, Secret Service, and U.S. Postal Service with computer terminals thatthey use to inquire of SIC, SIC and these law enforcement agencies havenot established a mechanism through which SIC could provide them with reportsSIC receives of lost, stolen or missing certificates. SIC currently notifiesthe FBI and Secret Service on a voluntary basis of all hits (hits occurwhen an inquiry matches a report of a lost, missing or stolen certificate)within their respective jurisdictions, rather than notifying these agencieswhen the loss is originally discovered and a report is sent to SIC. Thus,because it is critical that the appropriate law enforcement agencies beginan investigation, if one is warranted, immediately, the Commission stressesthat SIC's information-sharing arrangement with these law enforcement agenciesdoes not relieve Program participants of their notification responsibilities.  Several commentators, including the SIA, urged the Commission to adopta definition of the phrase ``appropriate law enforcement agency'' thatwould permit participants to notify any appropriate law enforcement agency.These commentators also focused on the burden compliance with the proposeddefinition would place on participants and advocated that the Commissiondefine ``appropriate law enforcement agency'' consistent with its pastinterpretation.24<NOTE/>The Commission believes, however, that its prior interpretationcaused confusion within the industry and did not ensure that law enforcementofficials were receiving prompt notification of losses and thefts. Therefore,the Commission has rejected this recommendation in favor of mandating reportssolely to the FBI.25<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>24In 1977, the Commission issued a release outlining generalguidelines for reporting institutions to determine which agency was the``appropriate law enforcement agency.'' In that release the Commissionstated that a ``[g]ood faith determination and notification to [local lawenforcement agencies, the FBI or the U.S. Secret Service] shall be deemedin compliance with paragraph (b)(1) of andSection;240.17f-1.'' SecuritiesExchange Act Release No. 13832 (August 5, 1977) 42 FR 41022, 41023 n. 10.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>25Continental Bank and CCHA noted in their comments that thefederal bank regulators impose on regulated banks a requirement that theyreport losses, thefts or counterfeiting of securities to the FBI, the U.S.Attorney and the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency within sevendays. The Commission recognizes that requiring these banks to comply fullywith the Commission's rules in addition to their appropriate regulatoryagencies' requirements is duplicative. Thus, to relieve somewhat the burdenon these institutions, the Commission has adopted an amendment which wouldpermit these banks to file with the FBI the Criminal Referral Form requiredby the bank regulators, instead of Form X-17F-1A. The Criminal ReferralForm must be filed within the time frames specified in Rule 17f-1, however.Moreover, these financial institutions will continue to be required tofile Form S-17F-1A with SIC and the transfer agent for the issue. The Commissionconsidered permitting banks to file the Criminal Referral Form with SICas well; however, the Criminal Referral Form does not request all the informationrequired by Rule 17f-1(c)(5). Thus, the Commission believes it is necessarythat banks continue to file Form X-17F-1A with SIC.   <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Transfer Agent Reporting Requirements to Commission, SIC and AppropriateLaw Enforcement Agencies   </ITAG>The Commission has determined to adopt an amendment to Rule 17f-1 to codifya longstanding Commission interpretation that transfer agents must notifySIC of lost, stolen or counterfeit securities certificates only if theyreceive notification from a non-reporting institution or if the securitiescertificates were in their possession or control at the time of the loss.26<NOTE/>The Commission believes that requiring transfer agents tomake reports to SIC in all instances in which they are informed of thetheft or counterfeiting of securities would be unduly burdensome for them.Often, registered transfer agents are informed of losses, theft or counterfeitingby other reporting institutions, who already have a duty under the Ruleto report to SIC. Requiring a duplicate report only would serve to addboth to the transfer agent's and SIC's administrative burden. Accordingly,the Rule as amended is designed to ensure that, should an individual shareholderreport the loss directly to a transfer agent or should the loss occur atthe transfer agent, the transfer agent would be required to notify SIC.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>26<T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 13832 (August 5, 1977),42 FR 42851. Specifically, the Rule as amended provides that a transferagent is not required to notify SIC if it receives notification on a FormX-17F-1A.   Morgan Bank and the STA recommended that the Commission exempt registeredtransfer agents from the appropriate law enforcement agency reporting requirement.These commentators argued that it is the securityholder's responsibilityto report losses or thefts of securities. They believe that transfer agentsonly should be required to advise securityholders of their obligation tonotify the appropriate officials. The Commission has decided not to adoptsuch an exemption for transfer agents. Although the Commission agrees thatthe individual securityholder is primarily responsible for notifying theappropriate authorities in the case of a theft, the Commission also believesthat individual investors may not always have the sophistication to determinethat they should notify the FBI or Secret Service and, instead, may notifyonly local authorities. It is more likely in such instances that otherinterested authorities might receive notification too late, if at all,to promptly initiate their investigations.   The Commission believes, therefore, that ensuring timely notification ofthe proper federal authorities of securities thefts, losses and counterfeitingoutweights the burdens imposed on transfer agents by this requirement,particularly where, as here, the reporting obligation is triggered by thepossibility of criminal activity. Accordingly, the Commission is amendingRule 17f-1 to require a transfer agent to report to the Commisson, SICand the FBI only if it receives notification of the loss, theft or counterfeitingfrom a non-reporting institution (<T3>e.g., </T3>an individual securityholder) or if the security was inits possession at the time of the loss.   <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Recovery Reports   </ITAG>The Commission has decided to adopt the proposed amendments that clarifywhich Program participants have the responsibility under Rule 17f-1(c)(4)to report to SIC (and the registered transfer agent for the issue) recoveriesof securities previously reported missing, lost or stolen. The Commissionreceived eight comments favoring this amendment and no comments opposingit.27<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>27<T3>See </T3>comments of American Bankers Association, ABA, ContinentalBank, ISA, Morgan Bank, SIA, STA, and Sovran Bank.   The obligation to report recoveries is limited to the institution thatoriginally reported the security as missing, lost or stolen. Some reportinginstitutions in the past, however, have interpreted the Rule to mean thatall reporting institutions that learn of a recovery of a security previouslyreported as lost, missing or stolen must report this recovery to SIC andthe registered transfer agent for the security involved. Thus, the Commissionhas decided to amend the Rule to clarify that only the reporting institutionthat originally reported a security as lost, missing or stolen must reportthe recovery of that security to SIC, a registered transfer agent for theissue, and the FBI.28<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>28One commentator requested that the Commission restate theRule's record retention requirements for original reporting institutions.<T3>See </T3>Drexel comment. The commentator requested that participantsbe reminded of the importance of maintaining accurate records of reportsto SIC, including records of why the report originally was made. Rule 17f-1(g)provides that records must be kept for three years. The Commission stressesthat this is a minimum requirement and encourages participants to retainthese records as long as is feasible.   Two commentators urged the Commission also to permit (or require) the registeredtransfer agent for the issue, even if it was not the original reportinginstitution, to make recovery reports.29<NOTE/>These commentators suggested that because transfer agentsoften are notified of a recovery when the original reporting institutionis not, it would be efficient to permit them to make recovery reports.The Commission has decided, however, not to permit recovery reports froma transfer agent who is not the original reporting institution. The Commissionunderstands that SIC routinely informs the recovering institution of theoriginal reporting institution's identity and the name and phone numberof a contact person at that institution. Thus, the original reporting institutioncan report the recovery.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>29<T3>See </T3>comments of American Transtech and SESTA.By permitting deletions from the data base only on instructions from theoriginal reporting institution and, thus, only when the recovery reportdata elements match exactly those of the earlier reports, the integrityof the data base is protected. Permitting participants other than the originalreporting institution to report recoveries might permit the holder of stolensecurities to remove the report of loss on file with SIC and thereby facilitatenegotiation of those valueless securities. While recognizing that reportsof lost, missing or stolen securities certificates could remain in thedata base even though another reporting institution had recovered the certificates,the Commission believes that it is far better to maintain a slightly over-inclusivedata base than one that is under-inclusive.Furthermore, SIC's system at this time cannot accept recovery reports fromparticipants other than the original reporting institution. The Commissionis working with SIC, however, to enable the transfer agent for the issueinvolved to make a recovery report. Once SIC completes the necessary systemenhancements, the Commission will reconsider this requirement.D. Inquiry RequirementsRule 17f-1(d)(1) of the Rule requires reporting institutions (other thantransfer agents) to inquire about every securities certificate that comesinto their possession, unless an exemption exists. The Commission proposedthree amendments to the exemptions in subparagraph (d) to: (1) Reduce the$10,000 <T3>de minimis</T3> transaction exemption to $5,000; (2) restrict the scopeof the customer exemption; and (3) clarify that transfer agents are exemptfrom the inquiry provisions of the Rule only when they are acting in theircapacity as transfer agent. The Commission received substantial commenton these proposals.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. The De Minimis Transaction Exemption</ITAG>Rule 17f-1(d)(1)(iv) currently provides that no inquiry is required ifa reporting institution receives certificates as part of a transactionvalued at $10,000 or less.\3\\0\<NOTE/> This exemption is called the <T3>de minimis</T3> transaction exemption.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\0\ The phrase ``as part of a transaction'' means the entirepackage of securities offered by a customer for a transaction. Reportinginstitutions should not evaluate each type of security separately to seewhether each meets the <T3>de minimis </T3>threshold, but rather participants should look at allthe securities involved in the transaction to determine whether the exemptionapplies.In its May 1984 Report concerning the Program, GAO recommended, among otherthings, that the Commission either eliminate or reduce the $10,000 <T3>de minimis</T3> transaction exemption. GAO stated that a reductionof the <T3>de minimis</T3> exemption would result in an increase in the numberof securities certificates recovered. Accordingly, in the Proposal Release,the Commission requested comment on lowering the existing <T3>de minimis</T3> transaction exemption to $5,000 and also on raisingthe exemption ceiling or eliminating it entirely.The Commission received numerous comments on this proposal, overwhelminglyagainst lowering the <T3>de minimis</T3> ceiling.\3\\1\<NOTE/> Most commentators indicated that industry perceptions ofan appropriate ceiling have not changed since the $10,000 level was established.The $10,000 ceiling was set in 1979 after extensive industry comment. Commentssubmitted in 1979 indicated that a ceiling below $10,000 would increaseuser expenses dramatically, without corresponding returns in the form ofrecovered certificates. Consistent with these earlier findings, the vastmajority of commentators strongly disagreed with lowering the <T3>de minimis</T3> transaction exemption. The comments also indicatedthat reducing the threshold reporting level to $5,000 would result in asignificant increase in the number of inquiries reporting institutionswould be required to make.\3\\2\<NOTE/> All the commentators noted that inquiring of SIC's data baseis an extremely laborious process. Thus, these commentators believe, theircosts of compliance also would increase significantly. Additionally, manycommentators believe that the savings to reporting institutions from increased``hits'' would not increase in proportion to the increased inquiry costs.\3\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\1\<T3>See</T3> comments of American Bankers Association, ABA, Boettcher,Bradford, Continental Bank, Dean Witter, Hospital Trust, Merrill Lynch,SIA, SESTA and Sovran Bank.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\2\ In its comments the SIA stated that some of its membersestimated that the number of mandated inquiries would increase by as muchas 60%.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\3\ Some commentators stated that items with a value lessthan $15,000-$25,000 are not frequently subject to criminal activity. (Further,the American Bar Association stated that it believes that lowering thethreshold for inquiries only could result in diminishing returns when comparedwith the increased costs to be borne by reporting entities.)Relying on commentator experience and cost estimates, the Commission hasdetermined that the potential benefits of lowering the exemption do notoutweigh the potential increased compliance costs and, thus, has concludedthat lowering the <T3>de minimis</T3> transaction exemption is not warranted. As noted above,Program participants' costs could increase substantially, as could thecost of administering the Program. Moreover, it is not clear that loweringthe exemption would increase substantially the number of ``hits'' to participants.As noted by the American Bankers Association in its comments, SIC's statisticsshow that currently 20% of all inquiries involve transactions with securitiesvalued under $10,000. Similarly, SIA noted that GAO's own findings showedthat approximately 30% of the securities found through the program in 1980involved transactions of less that $10,000. SIA believes this evidenceshows that, where circumstances warrant, participants already voluntarilyinquire of SIC about securities even if their value is less than $10,000.Thus, lowering the ceiling would not significantly increase the numberof hits. The Commission agrees that the best interpretation of this evidenceis that Program participants are exercising good business judgment in determiningwhen to inquire and are permissively inquiring on securities they believemay pose undue risk.\3\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\4\ Rule 17f-1(e) provides that reporting institutionsmay report to or inquire of SIC voluntarily on any security not otherwiserequired by the Rule.It bears repeating that Program participants must use their judgment indeciding whether to inquire voluntarily on securities certificates eventhough they are permitted to claim an inquiry exemption with respect tothose certificates. The Commission believes that strong incentives to inquirevoluntarily continues to exist in many instances. For example, any timea customer asks a reporting institution to guarantee his or her signature,the reporting institution may wish to make a inquiry.The Commission believes it is appropriate to retain the current <T3>de minimis</T3> transaction exemption and to continue to leave to Programparticipants the business decision of when to inquire permissively on lower-valuedtransactions. Although the Commission specifically requested comment onwhether the <T3>de minimis</T3> transaction exemption ceiling should be raised, fewcommentators addressed that question. While four commentators suggestedgenerally that some increase might be appropriate,\3\\5\<NOTE/> some rejected the notion of raising the ceiling.\3\\6\<NOTE/> Industry perception seems to be that the $10,000 thresholdstrikes an appropriate balance between the need to detect lost, stolenand counterfeit securities and the need to establish some minimum belowwhich the incremental costs of inquiry are outweighed by the likely returns.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\5\ <T3>See </T3>comments of ABA, Hospital Trust, Merrill Lynch and SIA.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\6\ <T3>See</T3> Comments of Drexel and Goldman Sachs.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. The Customer Exemption</ITAG>The Commission proposed to limit and clarify the exemption from the inquiryrequirement of certain securities certificates that are received from aProgram participant's customers.\3\\7\<NOTE/> The Commission has decided not to adopt the proposed amendmentsand instead is amending the customer exemption by defining the term ``customer''to mean any person with whom the reporting institution has entered intoat least one prior securities-related transaction. The Commission alsoamended the Rule to include a definition of the phrase ``securities-relatedtransaction.'' That term is defined as ``a purchase, sale or pledge ofinvestment securities, or custodial arrangement for investment securities.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\7\ Rule 17f-1(d)(1)(iii).As noted in the Proposal Release, the Division of Market Regulation inthe past has interpreted the customer exemption to apply only when a Programparticipant received securities certificates registered in the deliveringcustomer's name and (1) the program participant, on at least one occasion,inquired of SIC with respect to securities certificates previously receivedfrom this customer; or (2) the security was previously sold to the customerby that reporting institution. The Commission's proposed modification onlywould have exempted participants from inquiring on certificates registeredin the customer's name if the participant sold the securities to the customeroriginally, as verified through the participant's internal records.Twelve commentators strongly disagreed with this proposed change.\3\\8\<NOTE/> The commentators believe that requiring participants to verifythrough their internal records that they sold the securities to the customereffectively would eliminate the exemption. They believe it would be morecost-effective to inquire of SIC on every customer transaction than tocheck manually their records to determine whether they sold the securitiesto the customer. They also stressed, however, that inquiries to SIC arelabor-intensive and costly. Many stated that the proposed amendment wouldincrease significantly the number of inquiries to SIC on a daily basis,potentially overburdening both Program participants and SIC.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\8\ <T3>See </T3>comments of American Bankers Association, ABA, Boettcher,Bradford, CCHA, Continental Bank, Dean Witter, Drexel, Hospital Trust,Merrill Lynch, SIA and Sovran Bank.The Commission agrees with these commentators that the proposed amendmenteffectively would have mandated inquiry on every customer transaction.Moreover, the Commission believes the amendment is not necessary in lightof the Senate hearings on Organized Crime held in the early 1970s, currentindustry perceptions about which types of securities are more likely tobe subject to criminal activity, and the likely burden the proposed amendmentwould place on participants.\3\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\9\ <T3>See Hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, OrganizedCrime_Stolen Securities,</T3> Senate Committee on Government Operations,92nd Cong., 1st Sess. (1971); 93rd Cong., 1st Sess. (1973); 93 Cong., 2ndSess. (1974) (``1973 Hearings''). Testimony at the hearings indicated thatbearer securities and securities registered in street name were most likelyto be subject to criminal activity. By contrast, it was pointed out thatsecurities certificates registered in owners' names constitute a smallportion of the stolen securities traffic. The individuals testifying believedthat inquiry on these types of securities would not result in a significantnumber of hits. <T3>See, e.g., id.,</T3> 1973 Hearings at 643, 647-648 (Testimony of WilliamFitzpatrick and Roger Birk). The Commission was well aware of the relativelylow probability of successful negotiation of registered customer securitieswhen it crafted the customer exemption. The exemptions to the Rule's inquiryrequirements thus were structured to make inquiry unnecessary in the majorityof instances and to require inquiry only in those circumstances most likelyto involve missing, lost, counterfeit or stolen certificates. <T3>See</T3> H. Rep. No. 229, 94th Cong., 103-104 (1975). Letter from MarcL. Weinberg, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, to James M. Leeper,Trust Department, The Bank of New Orleans and Trust Company (November 27,1978); Letter from Gregory C. Yadley, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation,to the Honorable Dick Clark, United States Senate (September 25, 1978).Several commentators indicated that the securities industry continues tobelieve that bearer-form and street-name securities are the types of securitieswhich pose the greatest risk to Program participants. As the SIA notedin its comments, Program participants already are subject to various self-regulatoryorganization rules requiring participants to ``know their customer.'' \40\<NOTE/> Moreover, most Program participants require the presenterof registered securities certificates to present proof of identity beforethey will accept securities. The Commission has decided, for these reasons,not to amend the rule to require verification that the firm previouslysold the securities to the customer.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>NYSE Rule 405; NASD Manual section 21(b).The Commission has decided, however, to adopt a definition of the term``customer'' to clarify for Program participants when the inquiry exemptionis available to them. The amendment provides that a ``customer'' is anyperson with whom the participant has entered into a sale, purchase or pledgeof investment securities, or a custodial arrangement for investment securities.Requiring some prior securities-related transaction should ensure thatthe Program participant previously investigated the customer's identityand, thus, should inhibit forgeries of securities certificates.\41\<NOTE/> Moreover, the Commission believes that this is an objectivestandard that Program participants should be able to apply easily in determiningwhether they may claim the exemption and should be readily enforceableby participants' appropriate regulatory agencies. Thus, the amended exemptionwould apply when a reporting institution receives a securities certificateregistered in the name of one of its customers, as that term now is definedin the rule, or if the securities previously were sold to that customerand the sale is verified through the reporting institution's internal records.As we noted earlier, however, the Commission strongly encourages reportinginstitutions to inquire voluntarily when circumstances suggest that inquirywould be advisable.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ Program participants should be aware, however, that theCommission will construe this exemption strictly. For example, if a customerpresents securities registered in his or her name, as well as someone else's(<T3>e.g., </T3>a spouse's), the exemption is available <T3>only</T3> if both owners are ``customers'' under the definition.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. The Transfer Agent Exemption</ITAG>The Commission is adopting an amendment to Rule 17f-1(d)(1) clarifyingthat the inquiry exemption for transfer agents is available only to reportinginstitutions that receive securities certificates in their capacity astransfer agents, paying agents, exchange agents, tender agents or registrars.\42\<NOTE/> The Commission's proposed amendment clarified that the exemptionapplied to reporting institutions acting in the capacity of transfer agentfor the issue. Several commentators requested, however, that the Commissionapply the exemption to these institutions when acting in their capacityas paying agents, exchange agents, tender agents or bond registrars.\43\<NOTE/> In particular, Citibank noted that often agents are appointedto process corporate reorganizations such as mergers, tender offers andexchange offers. In performining these functions, these agents have thesame securityholder records, particularly stop files, that transfer agentspossess.\44\<NOTE/> Because the transfer agent inquiry exemption is based onthe fact that transfer agents possess an accurate record of lost, stolen,missing and counterfeit securities certificates, the Commission believesit appropriate to extend the exemption to all agents who, in their capacityas paying agents, exchange agents, tender agents or bond registrars, arein possession of these securityholder records. To claim this inquiry exemption,however, these agents must have possession of both the issuer's securityholderlist and the current stop file.\45\<NOTE/> The Rule is being amended to require both types of information.The same reasoning applies when transfer agents are acting in the capacityof registrar for bond or other debt issues.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ The Commission received comments from seven entitiesthat favored the clarification of the exemption. <T3>See </T3>comments of American Bankers Association, Bank of America,Continental Bank, ISA, Morgan Bank, STA and Sovran Bank.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ <T3>See</T3> comments of American Bankers Association, Bank of Americaand Citibank.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ A ``stop file'' is a transfer agent's record of all securitiescertificates that securityholders have reported to the transfer agent asmissing, stolen or otherwise not suitable for transfer.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ We understand that it is standard industry practice thatthese agents secure the most recent securityholder and stop list from therecord agent immediately before these agents perform their functions. Webelieve this is not only sound business practice, but also necessary forthe exemption from inquiry to apply.E. Securities Subject to Inquiry andReporting Requirements<ITAG tagnum="81">1. U.S. Government and Agency Securities</ITAG>The Commission has decided to adopt the proposed amendment eliminatingthe reporting and inquiry exemption for registered U.S. Government andU.S. Government agency securities (``government securities''). The Commissionreceived seven comments on its proposed elimination of this exemption.Six commentators supported this amendment \46\<NOTE/> and one opposed it.\47\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ <T3>See</T3> comments of American Bankers Association, Autex, Drexel, GoldmanSachs, ISA and Sovran Bank.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ <T3>See</T3> comments of Hospital Trust.Bearer-form government securities have been subject to the inquiry andreporting requirements of the Rule since 1979. Inquiries and reports onthose securities originally were processed by the Federal Reserve Banks.In 1979, however, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Systemadvised the Commission that the Federal Reserve Banks no longer wishedto process inquiries concerning lost or stolen bearer securities and thatreports and inquiries about those securities should be directed elsewhere.Following notice and comment, the Commission revised the Program to requirethat reports and inquiries about lost and stolen government bearer certificatesbe made to SIC.\48\<NOTE/> At that time, the Federal Reserve Banks continued to provideservices similar to those provided through the Program for registered-formgovernment securities issues. The Federal Reserve Banks, however, no longerprovide those services for registered-form government securities.\49\<NOTE/> Therefore, the Commission believes it is critical that SICtake over this responsibility.\50\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 15867 (May 23, 1979),44 FR 31500.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ The U.S. Department of the Treasury (``Treasury'') willcontinue, of course, to handle claims for securityholders of lost or stolengovernment securities. The Commission wishes to stress that its amendmentto the Program in no way is meant to affect Treasury's regulations. <T3>See</T3> Bureau of the Public Debt comment.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ In its report on the Program, GAO also strongly recommendedthat these securities be brought within the scope of the Program. <T3>See</T3> GAO Report, <T3>supra</T3> note 2, at 14-18.The majority of all new government securities issues are issued in book-entry-onlyform through the Federal Reserve's book-entry system and thus would beexcluded from the Program under these amendments. The Commission believes,however, that certificated government securities should be covered by theProgram.\51\<NOTE/> Moreover, the Government Securities Act of 1986, enactedon October 9, 1986,\52\<NOTE/> amended, among other things, section 17(f) of the Act torequire reporting institutions, including government securities brokersand dealers, to report and inquire about government securities. The legislationalso amended section 17(f) to require the Commission and the Secretaryof the Treasury to enter into an agreement to share on a regular basisinformation about lost, missing, stolen and counterfeit government securities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ The Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Public Debt(``Bureau'') was concerned that eliminating the government security exemptionwould bring U.S. savings notes and bonds within the scope of the Program.As the Bureau noted, however, these securities are not negotiable and cannotbe assigned. Thus, Program participants never would have occasion to inquireabout these types of securities and their inclusion in the Program, theBureau believes, is not warranted. <ITAG tagnum="28">The Commission agrees with the Bureau that inclusion of U.S. savingbonds and notes in the Program is not necessary. The Commission is amendingRule 17f-1(f), which lists the types of securities that are exempt fromthe reporting and inquiry requirements of the Program. Among others, securitiesfor which neither record nor beneficial owners can obtain a negotiablesecurities certificate are exempt from the Program. Thus, the Commissionbelieves that, because U.S. savings bonds and notes are not negotiable,they will be exempt from inquiry and reporting under the Rule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ <T3>See</T3> Pub. L. No. 99-57 (October 28, 1986).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Securities Not Assigned CUSIP Numbers</ITAG>The Commission has decided not to adopt the proposed amendment eliminatingthe exemption for securities not assigned CUSIP numbers (``non-CUSIP securities'').\53\<NOTE/> Commentators' response to this proposal was mixed. Severalcommentators responded that they favored inclusion of non-CUSIP securitiesin the Program.\54\<NOTE/> GAO, in its May, 1984 report on the Program, also calledfor inclusion of non-CUSIP securities because their inclusion would makethe Program's data base more comprehensive.\55\<NOTE/> Several commentators, however, raised the concern that noalternative uniform descriptive system other than CUSIP has been adequatelydeveloped.\56\<NOTE/> Because of the difficulty of accurately describing non-CUSIPsecurities, these commentators believe the additional costs of includingthem in the Program surpass the usefulness of their inclusion at this time.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ CUSIP is the Committee on Uniform Securities IdentificationProcedures that created the CUSIP numbering system. The CUSIP numberingsystem provides the entire financial industry with a common and uniformlanguage to identify securities for use in processing and recording securitiestransactions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ <T3>See</T3> comments of ABA, Autex, Drexel, Goldman Sachs and ISA.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ <T3>See</T3> GAO Report, <T3>supra</T3> note 2, at 14-18.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\56\ <T3>See</T3> comments of American Bankers Association, CBA, CCHA, ContinentalBank, Hospital Trust and Sovran Bank.The Program currently is CUSIP-driven; in other words, the CUSIP numberis vital to identifying accurately a particular security. Most securitiesprocessing systems similarly are built around CUSIP numbers. A securityreceives a CUSIP number if it is traded on a national securities exchange,is listed in the National Quotation Bureau's ``pink sheets,'' is tradedon a national basis, or is of significant investor interest. Typically,short-term or very thinly traded securities are not assigned CUSIP numbers.The Commission has limited the reporting and inquiry requirements of Rule17f-1 to securities assigned CUSIP numbers because it believes that thesenon-CUSIP securities are neither widely held by public investors, nor readilynegotiable or often subject to loss, theft, or counterfeiting. The Commissionthus agrees with these commentators that, at least until an adequate descriptivesystem is designed, it is neither cost-effective nor feasible for non-CUSIPsecurities to be included in the Program on a mandatory basis.Currently SIC is accepting reports and inquiries on non-CUSIP securitieson a voluntary basis, assigning ``pseudo'' CUSIP numbers to non-CUSIP securities.Until an industry-wide description system is developed, the Commissionbelieves that voluntary reporting of non-CUSIP securities in the systemis the best way to maintain maximum Program efficiency and accuracy. TheCommission wishes to stress to Program participants, however, the importanceof providing as complete a description of non-CUSIP securities as possiblewhen making voluntary inquiries and reports.\57\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\57\ The Commission also stresses the importance of providingCUSIP numbers to SIC whenever the security has been assigned a CUSIP number.SIC has informed the Commission that Program participants frequently haveinquired of or reported to SIC on certificates and claimed the securityhad no CUSIP number when, in fact, the security was assigned a CUSIP number.Reports and inquiries entered into SIC's data base without the appropriateCUSIP number make SIC's data base inaccurate.<ITAG tagnum="28">SIC also has informed the Commission that many reporting institutionsare not including applicable certificate number prefixes and suffixes whenthey are reporting and inquiring. The provision of prefixes and suffixeshas been mandatory, however, since 1979. </ITAG><T3>See </T3>Rule 17f-1(c)(5)(vii) and Securities Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 15867 (July 1, 1979), 44 FR 31500. Identification of prefixes and suffixesis critical to ensure that the data base contains accurate and specificinformation.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Bond Coupons  </ITAG>In the Proposal Release, the Commission requested comment on whether itshould eliminate the reporting and inquiry exemption for bond coupons.The issue was raised in response to GAO's recommendation that the Commissionbroaden the scope of the Rule's reporting and inquiry requirements to includebond coupons.  The Commission has decided not to adopt the proposed amendment that wouldeliminate this exemption. The Commission received numerous comments indicatingthat reports and inquiries on bond coupons would be enormously costly forreporting institutions without corresponding benefits in the form or recoveryof lost and stolen coupons.\5\\8\<NOTE/> In fact, requiring inquiries on bond coupons might exposereporting institutions to greater risk by requiring more handling of thecoupons than is now necessary. Additionally, several collecting agent banksnoted in their comments that they routinely do not pay a coupon presenteruntil they receive verification from the issue that the coupons are accepted.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\8\<T3>See</T3> comments of American Bankers Association, American Transtech,CCHA, Continental Bank, Merrill Lynch, SESTA and Union Bank.   <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Exemptions for Transactions That Do Not Involve Certificates  </ITAG>The Commission is adopting the proposed amendment to Rule 17f-1(f) to exemptfrom the reporting and inquiry requirements uncertificated securities forwhich neither record nor beneficial owners can obtain negotiable securitiescertificates. No commentators disagreed with this proposal, and severalsupported it.\5\\9\<NOTE/> As discussed in the Proposal Release, the Program in itscurrent form has no applicability to these functionally uncertificatedissues. The Commission believes, therefore, that these types of securitiesshould be exempt from the reporting and inquiry provisions of the Program.The Commission also adopted definitions of the terms ``uncertificated security''\6\\0\<NOTE/> and ``global certificate securities issues.''\6\\1\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\9\<T3>See</T3> comments of American Bankers Association, ABA, ContinentalBank, Morgan Bank, STA and Sovran Bank.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\0\The definition of the term ``uncertificated security''is the same as the definition of that term in section 8-102(b) of the official1977 version of the Uniform Commercial Code (``UCC'').  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\1\A global certificate securities issue is one for whicha single master certificate representing the entire issue is registeredin the nominee name of a registered clearing agency and for which beneficialowners cannot receive negotiable securities certificates.  <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Summary of Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis  </ITAG>The Commission has prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (``Analysis'')in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 604, as amended by the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (the ``RFA''), on the amendments to Rule 17f-1. No comments were receivedspecifically concerning the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis preparedat the time of the Proposed Release. The Analysis notes that the amendmentsto this Rule are part of the Commission's review of the Lost and StolenSecurities Program (``Program''). The Analysis also notes that the amendmentsconcern: 1) Program registration; 2) reporting of lost, stolen, missingand counterfeit securities certificates to SIC and law enforcement agencies;and 3) inquiry of SIC about securities certificates that come into theirpossession. Specifically, the Analysis discusses that certain exemptionsfrom the Rule's registration, reporting and inquiry requirements have beenexpanded and clarified and that these changes should reduce the burdenon all affected entities, including small transfer agents.  The Commission recognizes its obligation to formulate compliance and reportingrequirements that take into account the economic impact of small transferagents. The RFA directs the Commission to consider significant alternativesto the amendments that would accomplish the stated objectives of applicablestatutes and minimize any significant economic impact on small transferagents. As discussed in the Analysis, the Commission considered the alternativesset forth in the RFA in developing the amendments. The amendments to Rule17f-1 do not impose additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements,and establish minimum performance standards, rather than particular designstandards. Accordingly, the Commission believes that any costs incurredby small transfer agents because of the amendments are far outweightedby the benefits that will accrue to the securities industry from the moreefficient and effective operation of the Program.A copy of the Analysis may be obtained by contacting Joseph B.
