Phillips, of Bartlesville, Okla., had until today torespond to the citations made by the department'sOccupational Safety and Health Administration on April 19.</LP><TEXT>   The explosion at the oil company's Pasadena, Texas,petrochemical plant last October was one of the nation'sworst postwar industrial accidents. It followed an 18-monthrash of fires and other accidents at numerous petrochemicalplants and oil refineries and has sparked keen interest inindustrywide safety and operating procedures.   But Phillips strongly disagreed with any assertions thatits operations were unsafe. &quot;Based on our investigation, weare convinced that this accident took place because of asingle, isolated departure from a clearly establishedprocedure,&quot; said C.J. Silas, Phillips's chairman. &quot;It did notresult from a failure in safety management at the complex, asstated in OSHA's report.&quot;   The company said that it was most concerned by OSHA'sallegation that it &quot;willfully endangered&quot; the safety of plantworkers. &quot;This simply was not and will never be the case,&quot;Mr. Silas said.   Phillips also said it would challenge the legality of themethod OSHA used to arrive at one of the largest fines in theagency's history. OSHA accused Phillips of 566 willfulviolations, which is equal to the number of workers that wereon site during the explosion. It then, in effect, moved tofine the company $10,000 for each of those workers.   In recent years, OSHA came under criticism from safetyexperts for what they considered innocuous fines, sometimesjust hundreds of dollars even when the death of a worker wasinvolved. But more recently it has taken a stronger stance,and especially since Gerard Scannell took over last year ashead of the agency.   According to Phillips's account of the accident, highlyflammable gases escaped from a polyethylene reactor and thenwere ignited &quot;as a result of violation of a procedure&quot; duringroutine maintenance. Phillips conducted an internalinvestigation that said there were three safety steps, andthat if any one of them had been followed the accidentwouldn't have occurred.   The first was the employment of a so-called lock-outdevice, which if used would have prevented a crucial valvefrom being opened, Phillips said. Another set of valvescontrolling air hoses that, in turn, activate that othercrucial valve were supposed to be closed, the company said.And the hoses are supposed to be disconnected, Phillipsmaintained. Phillips said its investigation found that noneof these procedures was followed.   Fish Engineering andamp; Construction Inc., a Houston-areacontractor that has worked at the Phillips plant for 17years, said it notified OSHA last week that it was contestingproposed penalties of $730,000. &quot;We expect to overturn (thepenalties) on appeal,&quot; said an attorney representing Fish.Four of the people killed in the explosion and 52 of the morethan 130 people injured worked for Fish.</TEXT></DOC>
