Horner won't seek re-electionas chairman and chief executive officer of the firm's U.S.and international practices.   The 56-year-old executive could have run for an additionalthree-year term; Peat Marwick's mandatory retirement age forthe positions is 60. But Mr. Horner, a veteran of 35 yearswith KPMG and its predecessors, said that the issues the firmfaces require an executive who will be able to stay on for alonger tenure.</LP><TEXT>   KPMG has 1,850 U.S. partners and a total of 6,100 partnersworld-wide, and is considered the largest of the Big Sixconsulting firms. The firm was formed out of the December1986 merger of Peat Marwick International and Klynveld Main andamp;Goerdeler.   Mr. Horner took over the top spots at Peat Marwick in 1984and analysts say he was the driving force behind the merger.He took over KPMG's international organization, based inAmsterdam, in 1988. His terms at KPMG's U.S. andinternational practices end Oct. 3 and Dec. 31, respectively.   &quot;He had the foresight to see this global economy we'regrowing into; . . . too many CPAs tend not to see the forestfor the trees,&quot; says Arthur W. Bowman of Bowman's AccountingReport in Atlanta. &quot;For the types of clients the Big Sixserve, you need this more-global&quot; operation.   KPMG's U.S. practice posted $1.77 billion in revenue forthe year ended June 30, 1989. World-wide, KPMG posted totalrevenue of $4.75 billion for the year ended Sept. 30, 1989,reflecting revenue from firms that have been merged into KPMGsince Sept. 30.   In a severely competitive climate, KPMG has a strongclient base in most major markets world-wide. Mr. Horner saysone challenge for his successor is to continue to build andsolidify the firm's position. Prior to the merger, PeatMarwick had 70% of its business in North America and 30%elsewhere; those percentages at KPMG now are 45% and 55%,respectively, Mr. Horner estimated.   A major challenge facing Mr. Horner's successor is how tomanage a firm in which the partners number in the thousands.&quot;How do you coordinate the various interests?&quot; Mr. Hornerasks rhetorically. The solution &quot;will take longer than thethree {more} years I would have had&quot; at KPMG, he says.   Neither Mr. Horner nor Mr. Bowman will speculate on apossible successor to KPMG's at the U.S. practice.Nominations for the positions will be finalized Sept. 20, andthe U.S. firm's partners will vote early in October.   KPMG's executive committee has nominated P.J. Butler,senior partner of the U.K. practice, to succeed Mr. Horner atthe international practice. The council overseeing theinternational practice will vote on that recommendation inSeptember.   Mr. Horner sits on a number of boards of charitableorganizations. He said he hasn't decided what he will doafter leaving KPMG.</TEXT></DOC>
