<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-52-0125 </DOCNO><TEXT>By using detailed models of the progenitor we show that the non-adiabaticsolution of the solar-neutrino problem by the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfensteinmechanism is compatible with the possible observation of neutronization{nu}/sub e/ from SN 1987A in its wide range of the mixing parametersat {Delta}m{sup 2}approx. andgt;10/sup -6/ eV{sup 2}. We also argue that,under the assumption of hierarchy of neutrino masses, our consistencysolution favors the {nu}/sub e/--heaviest-flavor-neutrino mixing as thecause of the solar-neutrino deficit.</TEXT></DOC>
