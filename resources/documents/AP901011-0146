State Supreme Court Justice Thaddeus Owens, the trial judge,said Charles Stressler's criminal trial could not continue without12 jurors. The alternate jurors in the case had been dismissedWednesday when deliberations began.   ``The defendant cannot waive a constitutional right,'' Owenssaid. ``The only alternative I have is to declare a mistrial.''   Earlier, after juror Lydia Bermudez told the judge that shecould not remain impartial and he dismissed her, both defense andprosecution lawyers agreed to proceed with deliberations and acceptjudgment from the remaining 11 jurors.   However, late Thursday, Owens called the lawyers back to thecourtroom and said he had learned state law prohibited fewer than12 jurors in a criminal case.   Stressler will go on trial again Jan. 17, when a co-defendant isscheduled to be tried on an assault charge, court officials said.Of those charged in the Bensonhurst attack, one has been convictedof murder and two of lesser charges, and four still face murdertrials.   Ms. Bermudez' outburst occurred shortly before noon, after thejury had heard about an hour's worth of readback of Stressler'strial testimony.   She began screaming at Moses Stewart, the father of murdervictim Yusuf Hawkins.   ``What are you looking at?'' she yelled at Stewart, sitting inthe second row of seats in the courtroom's spectator section.   ``She's talking to me?'' he asked.   ``You've been doing that to me every day. You know what I'mtalking about. You've been doing it every ... day,'' she shoutedback at Stewart.   After a few moments of silence in the stunned courtroom, Owenscalled the lawyers and Ms. Bermudez into his chambers to discusshow to handle the problem. A pool of two reporters were allowedinto the discussions.   With the judge and lawyers out of the courtroom and the jurorswatching, Stewart stood up and walked toward the door, mumblingangrily:   ``If she can't stand the father of the victim looking at her,get her ... out of here. I look at everybody on the jury. I don'tcare who she is, I look at everybody on the jury.''   In chambers, Stressler's lawyer, Jacob B. Evseroff, moved fordismissal of the indictment, mistrial or Stewart's exclusion fromthe courtroom.   Owens denied all three motions.   Ms. Bermudez told Owens she felt intimidated by Stewart andasserted: ``I don't need this aggravation from this freakinglow-life ...''   ``Yesterday, he had everybody staring at me .... I don't needthis. I don't need nobody staring at me,'' she told the judge andlawyers.   Owens sent Ms. Bermudez out to join the other jurors, and calledin Stewart to hear his side.   ``Yesterday, I felt the same way,'' he said. ``I felt she hasbeen trying to get into a staring contest with me. I'm looking ateverybody, not just her.''   He said that as thevictim's father he had a right to sit in onall of the proceedings.   ``I can't exclude him from the courtroom,'' the judge said.``His argument is as compelling as hers. We'll see which one staresthe other one down.''   When the reading back of testimony resumed, Stewart returned tothe courtroom for a few minutes, but quickly left.   Ms. Bermudez slumped in her chair, one hand hiding her face.   Outside the courtroom during the lunch recess, prosecutorsrefused to comment.   ``I have never, in 42 years, ever seen anything like this,''Evseroff said.   The panel began deliberating the case late Wednesday.   Stressler, 22, is accused of murder, manslaughter, riot andother crimes in the Aug. 23, 1989, slaying of Hawkins, a16-year-old black shot through the chest when he and three friendscrossed paths with a mob of young whites in Brooklyn's Bensonhurstsection.</TEXT></DOC>
