The highlight of the Gates hearings last week occurredwhen Alaska Republican Frank Murkowski gave the CIA nomineethe chance to rebut innuendo from ABC's &quot;Nightline&quot; andelsewhere about his supposed role in supposed internationalintrigue that led to a supposed hostage deal with Iran by theReagan-Bush campaign.</LP><TEXT>   Senator Murkowski disclosed that the IntelligenceCommittee sicked the FBI and CIA Inspector General on thecase, only to come up empty-handed. His wry questions got alaugh from the audience, according to excerpts from theFederal Information Systems transcript:                                                                                                          Were you in Paris at any time during October 1980, for anyreason?   No, sir.   Were you ever in Madrid, Spain, at any time during 1980for any reason, bullfights or anything?   No, sir.   Did you assist Mr. Menashe transporting or counting the$16 million in hundred-dollar bills? {Laughter.}   No, sir. {Laughter.}                                                                                                          It is somehow fitting that the October Surprise should endin giggles.   As we've said before, when it comes to Iran-Contra, weadmit to not knowing how much Mr. Gates knew, and especiallyto not caring. Howard Metzenbaum, however, can't reel thisthing in but just won't let it go. The Senator took up hourson the subject but got little support among the otherSenators. Former CIA officer Alan Fiers, Lawrence Walsh'slatest whipping boy, cleared Mr. Gates, as did WilliamCasey's former deputy, Admiral Bobby Inman.   We suspect the curtain may be falling on Congress'sdecade-long run of melodramatic and sometimes farcicalpartisan hearings. An article in the trend-spotting Stylesection of the Washington Post last week suggested that thethrill is gone. &quot;Slowly, dully,&quot; the article said, theIntelligence Committee &quot;is adding a new layer of silt to thelandfill: The Allen memorandum. . . . The Kerr deposition. .. . The mini-finding.&quot;   This obsession with melodrama is unfortunate because thereare in fact some interesting questions the Senators couldhave asked Mr. Gates. For example, we'd like to know moreabout what the CIA thought about BCCI. When did the CIAinform the Federal Reserve, Treasury and Justice that theso-called bank's corruption went beyond money laundering?   There were questions about the CIA's conclusion that theKGB was involved in the 1981 attempted assassination attemptof the Pope, but no explanation from Mr. Gates why a CIAoperative in Rome tried to scare Claire Sterling intodropping her book that broke the news of the Bulgarianconnection. More broadly, we wonder if U.S. intelligencereally should be funneled through one central spigot, orwhether the CIA should evolve into something more like apolicy-options generator.   The problem with the Gates hearing is the familiar storyof Democrats with no hope of gaining the White Housescreaming as loudly as they can at the Republican Presidentabout anything or nothing. The editorial cartoon reprintedhere captures this spirit perfectly. (See accompanyingillustration -- WSJ Sept. 23, 1991)   Indeed, Congressional lampooning seems to have become acottage industry these days. Jay Leno wades in regularly.There was also a sharp cartoon in the Akron Beacon Journalabout the Clarence Thomas hearings. It shows all the membersof the Judiciary Committee snoozing away, except for theChairman, who is addressing Judge Thomas. One aide explainsto another, &quot;The deal is, if Thomas stays awake throughBiden's natural law lecture, he gets the job.&quot;   Congressional hearings have become deep muddies ofposturing over substance, where no one comes out very clean.The fact that both Judge Thomas and Mr. Gates are emergingintact is a sign that the strategy of demolition hearings mayno longer work.</TEXT></DOC>
