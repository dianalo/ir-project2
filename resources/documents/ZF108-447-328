(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>C Development Environments Compilation speed and size of executable code areimportant considerations in choosing a C compiler.andP;  However, the ability touse a product is equally important.andP;  If the code-compile-link-debug processis clumsy or awkward, even the fastest and most efficient compiler can bedifficult to use.andP;  Choosing a compiler requires a balance between thecompiler's technical merits and your ability to work with it.andM;Development is a curious three-step dance between a compiler, debugger, andeditor.andP;  Many companies now provide these and other tools in a singlepackage, creating an integrated development environment.andP;  Others allow partsof the development cycle to be external, letting you use a favorite editor orlinker, for example.andM;To meet the definition of a fully integrated development environment, aproduct must offer an editor debugger, linker, library, and compiler in asingle framework.andP;  A make facility and other support utilities are usefultoo.andM;Borland Turbo CandM;Borland has long used integrated development environments in all itsproducts, and Turbo C v. 2.0 is no exception.andP;  It was one of the first fullyintegrated compilers; with its sibling Turbo Pascal, Turbo C set the standardfor others.andP;  The professional release of Turbo C provided for this reviewalso included the Turbo Assembler and Turbo Debugger.andP;  Turbo Debugger is astand-alone debugger: Turbo C includes a debugger as part of its integrateddevelopment environment.andM;The Turbo C documentation consists of two paperback manuals.andP;  Surprisingly,we didn't encounter any problems with broken spines.andP;  The user's guide is 400pages long; the reference guide is 600 pages.andP;  The manuals are attractivelybound and cleanly laid out.andP;  The table of contents and index are very good.andM;The user's guide has chapters on installation, start-up, the integratedenvironment, compiler, debugger, and video functions.andP;  Two chapters for TurboPascal and Turbo PROLOG programmers ease the transition to C for thosefamiliar with Borland's Pascal or PROLOG language products.andP;  A languagereference and programming note round out the manual.andM;Several members of the review team found the manual slightly confusing whentrying to locate specific items and details about a feature.andP;  The manual iswritten in an informal tone that will be ideal for those who are new to C orintegrated environments but may seem a little condescending or verbose tothose who wish to get up and running quickly.andM;The library routines are alphabetically arranged in the reference guide.andP;  Wewould have preferred each function to have its own page.andP;  Summaries areprovided for the editor, make, cc program, and other utilities.andP;  Aconfiguration guide is also provided.andP;  The function reference is quite goodbut more brief than others we have seen.andM;Turbo C is provided on six diskettes (5 1/2-inch, 360K format).andP;  Theinstallation routine is fully automated after you type the name of a batchfile and is as painless as any we tested.andP;  Turbo C can be run on floppies,but this is somewhat awkward.andP;  The installation routine lets you set thesystem up this way and requires three 360K floppies.andM;Turbo C's editor is WordStar-like and powerful.andP;  It performs virtually allthe editor functions that could be required.andP;  It is fully integrated with theTurbo C debugger and is used to full effect in the integrated environment.andO;When the editor and debugger were used together, the editor automaticallylined itself up at the source of an error and displayed debugger or compilererror messages.andM;The integrated debugger is a very good product, especially in the integratedenvironment.andP;  It fully supports breakpoints, watch screens, and all the otherfeatures you would expect.andP;  Turbo Debugger is even better.andP;  Its cleanwindowing environment provides expanded capability of the integrated product.andO;The make utility is smaller than UNIX's but covers all the functions aprogrammer would need.andM;The Turbo Profiler -- announced at Software Development '90 in February butnot yet shipping at press time -- will be a welcome addition to the TurboAssembler-Turbo Debugger package.andP;  Turbo Profiler should be part of Turbo CProfessional by the time you read this.andM;The development environment was particularly easy to use since all commandsare cleanly displayed, intuitive, and consistent throughout all the programmodules.andP;  With small to medium-sized programs, the debugger-editor was a joyto use.andP;  Errors were trapped quickly and the editor positioned to correctlocations for fixing syntax and loop errors.andP;  The debugger messages wereclear and descriptive.andP;  The windowing system was excellent.andM;The Turbo C system can be used either as a full integrated developmentenvironment or as stand-alone utilities.andP;  Either way, Turbo C is an excellentproduct and we thoroughly enjoyed using it.andM;EcoSoft Eco-C88andM;The EcoSoft Eco-C88 compiler has undergone minor revisions since last year.andO;The system is not a full integrated development environment but includes aneditor, debugger, and compiler.andP;  No linker is included.andP;  The Eco-C88documentation is enclosed in a standard-sized, three-ring binder holdingabout 500 pages.andP;  The manual is divided into chapters about installation, thecompiler in general, ANSI enhancements supported by Eco-C88, debugging,assembler interfacing, the editor, and notes on the language as supported byEco-Soft.andP;  The manual is easy to read and well written.andP;  The print looks asthough the pages were photocopied or low-resolution laser-printed, althoughthis was not the case.andM;The language reference is laid out so each function can be quickly located:each function name is in large, bold print and is accompanied by an example.andO;The index could use some expanding.andP;  The documentation makes no attempt toteach C or even provide a summary of the language.andM;Eco-C88 is supplied on seven 5 1/2-inch disks, although the compiler isreally on only one diskette.andP;  Another is dedicated to the CED editor, one tothe C-more debugger, and four to the libraries (one each for small, medium,large, and compact).andP;  A single executable program installs Eco-C88, a nicechange from earlier versions.andP;  A floppy version can be supported on threediskettes (or four if using another library other than small).andM;The install routine executes cleanly, prompting for directories as needed.andO;Aside from a trivial screen typo, the routine guides you through theinstallation process.andP;  It allows the editor, debugger, and any of thelibraries to be installed.andP;  When completed, the installation routine printsout the contents of any README file that may reside on the main diskette.andO;These are displayed on the screen in a formatted manner and take some time togo through.andP;  The installation routine does not attempt to change theCONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT files, leaving this to the user.andP;  Many userscomplain about the automatic adjustment of the AUTOEXEC, but with compilersthat set many environment variables, it is nice to have this option.andM;Eco-C88 includes versions of PATH and several other environment variablesthat apply only to the Ecosoft products.andP;  These can be included in AUTOEXECto prevent searching of the compiler directories when you're not using thecompiler.andP;  While not particularly elegant, the Eco-C88 installation routineis fast, clean, and easy to follow.andM;The Eco-C88 compiler includes a cc that runs the compiler as well asMicrosoft's assembler (MASM) and linker (LINK).andP;  It can be used with PhoenixSoftware's linker (Plink) as well.andP;  A small, make-like option available withcc provides a much reduced version of the standard UNIX make.andM;The CED editor is a screen-oriented text editor that allows two files to beopen at once.andP;  It is also a programming environment manager that allows someof the usual integrated development environment capabilities from withinitself.andP;  The editor and debugger lack the full linking of other products, butdo allow compile-and-link from within the editor.andM;When errors are detected in the source code, they are listed in red in aseparate window of the editor.andP;  The CED editor itself is fairly standardeditor fare with a few nice features.andP;  It uses simple commands based onWordStar but is powerful enough for use with most program development tasks.andM;The C-more source-code debugger provides good debugger support, including allbasic debugger features such as breakpoints, tracing, and register displays,but it lacks the flash some other integrated debuggers offer.andM;Eco-C88 is a good compiler.andP;  With the editor and debugger, it provides anenvironment that is not difficult to work with or hard to use.andP;  It does lackthe polish of other integrated development environments, and in afeature-for-feature comparison would lose a few points.andP;  The documentation isgood but not excellent.andP;  The editor is good but not outstanding.andP;  Thedebugger is good but something is missing.andM;Eco-C88 will appeal to beginning and average programmers, who will be happywith it for the most part.andP;  Its small size makes it an ideal floppy-basedcompiler.andP;  Eco-C88 comes up short for heavy-duty C users, though.andM;JPI TopSpeed CandM;The TopSpeed C compiler is available in two versions.andP;  The standard editionprovides the compiler, linker, make, and debugger.andP;  The extended edition addssource code for the libraries, Windows support, dynamic linking, a profiler,disassembler, and assembler.andP;  OS/2 versions are available.andP;  The TopSpeed Csystem is a complete integrated development environment.andM;The TopSpeed C documentation comes in a number of paperback books.andP;  It wouldhave been nice to have a slipcase to keep them together.andP;  The manuals aredevoted to a language tutorial, language reference, library reference,Techkit (utility) manual, and user manual.andP;  A slimmer volume containingtechnical specifications is also included.andM;The manuals are all easy to look at and read.andP;  The user's guide includes thesimple installation instructions as well as an overview of the environmentand discussions of the make facility, debugger, and assembler.andM;The language tutorial is a reasonably good guide to the C language.andP;  While itmay suffice to get novice C users up and running, it should be supplementedwith other texts since it is in a reference format.andM;The function reference is good if somewhat brief.andP;  Each function is titled ina box, but these follow one another instead of the preferred one-per-pageformat.andP;  Descriptions are very short.andM;The TopSpeed C system is provided on seven diskettes with an additional fourfor the extended system.andP;  Installation is a matter of typing one command andapproving default values.andP;  The rest is automated.andP;  While this does notprovide as much configuration ability in the installation as other packages,it does allow the system to be rapidly installed by a complete novice andperforms the process.andM;The editor is based on WordStar and similar to Turbo C's in most respects.andO;The keystrokes can all be edited so the editor resembles any word processor'scommands.andP;  The system will display up to nine windows within the editingenvironment.andM;The debugger is a source-level symbolic debugger with windowing.andP;  It isrelatively simple compared to others in this review but quite adequate formost purposes.andP;  Breakpoints and register displays are available, as istracing.andP;  The TopSpeed C environment is a configurable windowing system witha good make facility.andM;TopSpeed C offers a fully integrated development environment in a very nicepackage.andP;  The manuals are well done and the tutorial will help newcomers.andO;The debugger is quite good, but it does lack a few of the features found inmore extensive tools.andP;  Obviously ease of use was traded against the fullcapabilities of a top-level debugger, and the tradeoff works in this system.andM;Lattice CandM;Lattice C is one of the veteran compilers reviewed here, and it has improvedwith each release.andP;  This release is a comprehensive package that provides apowerful compiler for DOS and OS/2 with a very good debugger.andP;  Lattice Cincludes an assembler and a large set of libraries.andM;The documentation is contained in four standard-sized, three-ring bindersdedicated to the system library, user guide, application library, and LASM(assembler).andP;  One index covers all the volumes.andP;  The documentation iscomprehensive, well written, and an excellent model for other large systems.andO;It is easy to read and is arguably the best set of manuals in this review.andM;The Lattice C system is shipped in a large cardboard box (with a handle ontop, indicating the weight of the whole affair).andP;  The system comes on 11diskettes in their own case.andP;  Installation is automated and gives the usercomplete control over the installation process.andP;  A default installationavoids the plethora of prompts and installs the system quickly.andM;The environment supplies an editor and debugger.andP;  The editor is completelycustomizable to emulate favorite keystrokes.andP;  The editor positions the cursorat offending lines when errors are encountered during compilation.andP;  TheCode-Probe debugger is very powerful and ranks with the best reviewed here.andM;The entire development environment is quite simple, lacking some of the fancyoptional programs others include.andP;  However, this product means business: itwas not designed to please a bunch of picky people who want to manipulate DOSdirectories from within an integrated development environment.andM;The Lattice C system includes a very good make, library manager, diff, grep,splat (search and replace), touch (file attribute editor), and other tools.andO;It is UNIX-based and is consistent with development under the UNIXenvironment.andP;  An assembler and debugger are included.andP;  Libraries areextensive and comprehensive, including a database manager and screenmanagement (curses) system.andP;  This is a superb system for doingcross-development with UNIX.andM;Lattice C is a complete, comprehensive, powerful development tool.andP;  Thedebugger is excellent and the compiler is the standard against which othersare tested.andP;  The UNIX-like nature of the product may be daunting to some, aswill its sheer size and apparent complexity.andP;  However, it is worthwhile toput your fears aside for this product.andM;Manx Aztec C-86andM;Manx's Aztec C-86 is available in three versions for professional, developer,and commercial in order of capability.andP;  Only the developer and commercialversions include make, diff, grep, and the program prototyper and profiler.andO;The commercial version includes support libraries not available in the othertwo.andM;The Aztec C-86 documentation is in a standard, slip-cased, standard-sizedbinder and totals about 600 pages.andP;  The documentation is divided intodifferent sections for the various releases of the compiler, so the8086-family section includes details on the compiler, linker, and tools,followed by a system-independent section with references.andP;  The documentationis printed across the entire page with little border space, making the wholething look very busy.andP;  A little cosmetic work would help.andP;  Also, with therelease notes and update sheets, the manual could use reorganizing.andM;The function reference has examples, cross-references to other functions, andgood notes.andP;  We had some problems checking functions since they are not in asingle place but may be in one of three or more sections.andP;  Although we canunderstand the benefit to the vendors of separating system-dependent and-independent functions, this complicates things.andP;  It also makes for awkwardreading and comprehension at times.andP;  The rest of the manual is notparticularly well written.andP;  Trying to understand the debugger from the manualalone would be frustrating.andP;  All the information is supplied, but it is noteasily digested, written more as a reference and summary than discussion ofthe item in question.andM;The commercial version is on six diskettes.andP;  Installation is awkward.andP;  Thetutorial in the documentation guides you through making a single executablecompiler disk.andP;  No reference is made to hard disk installation, although thefirst diskette contains an install program.andP;  When executed, the programprovides all the features you would expect and installation continuescleanly.andM;Aztec C-86's editor is very similar to UNIX's vi and is not designed tofunction as an integrated development environment.andP;  It is not very powerfuland lacks many features expected in excellent program editors.andP;  Two debuggersare provided, one for source-level debugging and the other for assemblerlanguage.andP;  The debugger's design and utility are good but not excellent.andP;  Itis not integrated at all.andM;Aztec C-86 commercial and developer releases provide some UNIX programcapabilities with make, grep, and diff.andP;  A program profiler and prototyperare available, and these are interesting products in themselves.andP;  Theprofiler is a useful utility that is often purchased separately.andM;Our overall impression of Aztec C-86 was that it resembles products weencounter in the UNIX world: the documentation is as terse (and unreadable)as those distributed with UNIX operating systems, the editor is a copy ofUNIX vi, and the UNIX tools are similar too.andP;  This is great for those whowork with UNIX, but can cause many headaches for DOS users unfamiliar withthis environment.andP;  Aztec C-86 is not user-friendly in any sense, from itspoor documentation to its lack of an integrated development environment, butit is one heck of a compiler.andP;  If you work across environments and don't wantan integrated development environment, this is probably the product ofchoice.andM;MetaWare High CandM;High C is a comprehensive product that provides a highly capable compiler.andO;It does not offer an integrated development environment, but separatelyoffers the tools included in one (except debugger).andP;  The review copy includedextra libraries and B-tree data manager from Sterling Software, as well asthe EC editor and a package to make UNIX-like commands work on DOS machines.andM;The High C documentation is supplied in two standard-sized, three-ringbinders in slipcases.andP;  The manuals total over 1,000 pages and are not for thefaint-hearted!andP;  Despite its size, the documentation is readable.andP;  The indexeswere the best we have seen.andM;The reference manual gives each function a separate page.andP;  Unfortunately, theprinted image is not crisp, especially in the examples, which look likereproductions from a dot-matrix printer.andP;  Its descriptions are also a bitterse at times, but quite sufficient for most users.andM;The High C product is distributed as six diskettes, only three of which makeup the compiler.andP;  The others include the EC editor, GFX graphics library, andthe MicroEMACS editor (with source).andP;  Installation is straightforward using abatch file.andP;  Ours had a typographical error on the first line that neglectedto turn the ECHO off, resulting in very confusing screens.andP;  A chapter in thedocumentation covers customization and configuration.andP;  Support products areinstalled separately.andM;Additional documentation is included for the support libraries and utilitiessupplied with High C.andP;  These are quite good, but it would have been nice tohave them in another binder, so they do not become separated from the maindocumentation.andM;The editor included with High C gives you a fast, efficient environment forcoding but lacks the functionality of a full integrated developmentenvironment.andP;  MetaWare also includes MicroEMACS with source code for thosefamiliar with it.andP;  No debugger is included.andM;On the whole, High C looks like a UNIX tool, from the MicroEMACS editor tothe UNIX shell system and make utility.andP;  It lacks a fancy graphics interfaceand the ability to tie an editor into a debugger, but the compiler is thefocus of this product.andP;  From a development point of view, the High C systemis a set of disconnected programs.andM;Microsoft C 6.0andM;The Microsoft C 6.0 supplied to us was in beta release, although just beforedeadline we received a stable release version.andP;  The documentation waspreliminary and will probably differ with the final release.andM;The system comprises the compiler, the Programmer's Workbench (PWB), theQuick C environment for the main compiler, and the latest release of CodeView.andP;  It lets you program in the full environment of Quick C while using thepowerful compiler instead of the stripped-down Quick C.andM;The format of the documentation we received indicates that the final productwill probably be designed for two or three three-ring binders, and that thesewill be up to Microsoft's usual standards of presentation.andP;  The descriptionsin our sample were excellent, and special care was taken to provide a quickupgrade system for those now using a Microsoft C compiler.andM;Microsoft C 6.0 is supplied on seven diskettes and is installed with anexecutable program that covers every possibile situation.andP;  The editorprovides some remarkable capabilities, such as bookmarks (for rapid locationof code sections) and a powerful search system.andP;  It is customizable topreferred keystrokes.andM;The latest release of Code View is worth waiting for.andP;  It is redesignedcompletely and provides power that exceeds virtually every other debugger onthe market.andP;  While not trivial to learn and use efficiently, when mastered itgives you a tool that is difficult to surpass.andP;  The usual Code View abilitiesare supplemented with multiple windows that can be sized and scrolled, andlocal and multiple views of memory are now available.andM;Microsoft C 6.0 has new optimizations and a wide range of code-generationoptions, but the real news is the PWB, which represents the next stage inMicrosoft's evolving vision of how programming tools should work.andP;  The PWB ismightily impressive and more than a little intimidating.andM;The basic concept behind the PWB is simple.andP;  Instead of using stand-alonetools from the DOS command line, programmers should be able to call toolsfrom within the editor-based integrated development environment.andP;  This simplecapability has been a goal for most compiler vendors since the early days ofthe UCSD p-System and Turbo Pascal 1.0.andP;  The PWB extends theintegrated-development-environment model in several ways.andM;First, it makes the environment extensible.andP;  Third-party vendors -- and,conceivably, any programmer -- can add custom tools to the environment.andP;  Wantto use the help system's hypertext engine to organize your source codelibraries?andP;  No sweat.andP;  Want to use your own editor?andP;  No problem.andP;  Theopen-architecture system lets you add your own tools.andM;Second, the PWB's state is persistent.andP;  If you shell out of the editor to usethe debugger, your cursor is where you left it when you return.andP;  If you quitwork on the project to use another program or take a lunch break, all yourswitch settings -- all of them, including breakpoints and complicated macroexpressions in the debugger, compilation switches, build options, absolutelyall of them -- are reactivated when you resume work on the project.andM;Third, the PWB serves as a glossy front end to the compiler.andP;  Instead ofbuilding batch files with endless commands of slashes and letters to specifycompilation options, you use pull-down menus to communicate with and controlthe system.andP;  Since the compiler generates code for DOS, OS/2 PresentationManager, Windows applications, Windows dynamic link libraries, OS/2 DLLs, andother targets, and since each compilation can generate or not generatedebugging and code-analysis information, this easy-to-use, consistent frontend is a welcome interloper.andP;  When through tinkering you come up with aconfiguration you like, simply define it as a default and you'll be able toselect it from a pull-down menu anytime you like.andM;Finally, the PWB maintains a central database for each project you build.andO;The database includes information about source files -- includingdependencies, which libraries you use, make options -- and generated code.andP;  Asource code analyzer adds to the database at compile time, generatinginformation for a new tool, the Source Browser.andP;  The browser lets you viewcalling sequences, find function definitions, list all references to aparticular variable, and perform many other useful tasks.andM;Microsoft says increased programmer productivity is second only to fastexecution speed as a goal for its professional C compilers.andP;  The PWB reflectsthe company's commitment to that goal.andP;  Future releases of the compiler,which may require OS/2 and megabytes of memory on the development host, willenhance and extend the PWB.andM;Although it's impossible to be sure about Microsoft C 6.0 due to its betanature at this time, it looks like an impressive product is about to enterthe C compiler wars.andP;  This one has a nice integrated development environment,excellent debugger, and one of the most powerful compilers around.andP;  This willbecome a welcome new standard.andM;Mix Software Power CandM;Power C's documentation comes in two manuals, one for the compiler and theother if the Power C-trace debugger is purchased.andP;  The Power C manual is 660pages long and paperbound.andP;  The spines are not very strong and our copycracked in several places very quickly, although we did not lose pages.andM;The manual tries to provide a minitutorial on the C language, which will beuseful to those who have some programming experience in other high-levellanguages.andP;  Other sections of the documentation cover the C compiler,function list, and tools.andP;  The index is quite good but not as comprehensiveas others in this review.andP;  The documentation is well written, and themanual's printing is pleasing to the eye and easy to read.andM;The function reference is good if somewhat brief.andP;  Again, the functions arealphabetical, following one another down pages.andP;  Examples are usually brief,as are descriptions of the function.andM;No installation program is provided with Power C.andP;  Instead, the twodistribution diskettes are copied over using standard DOS commands, followingsimple instructions in the manual.andM;Power C has no editor, and no attempt is made at an integrated environment.andO;A very good make is provided, though, and we found Power C very easy to useas a stand-alone compiler.andP;  The debugger (available at extra cost) is calledPower C-trace and is one of the best we have seen.andP;  It provides the abilityto have four windows, chosen from a total of seven, on the screen at a time.andO;These windows are dedicated to C source code, output, variables, watchpoints,memory, symbols, and assembly language.andP;  It is quite astounding to watch theprogram execute the C source in one window, the assembler in another, and theoutput in a third.andP;  The debugger is fully windowed with color; if you have acolor monitor, you'll love this product.andM;The debugger allows unlimited breakpoints and up to 32 watchpoints, which canbe set on both C source or assembler.andP;  Watchpoints are possible on variablesand statements.andP;  Variables can be monitored and changed dynamically.andM;For its price, this package is nothing short of astounding.andP;  While Power Cdoes not offer a full integrated development environment, the compiler isvery good and the debugger excellent.andP;  It may well be worth considering thedebugger alone as an add-on to even the best of the other compilers reviewedhere.andM;Novell Network CompilerandM;The Novell C Network Compiler is Watcom C designed for networks.andP;  Thedocumentation is similar overall, but seems to have been rewritten andmodified for better reading.andP;  The system does not include all of the Watcomfeatures, such as UNIX tools (except make), debugger, and Express C.andM;The C Network Compiler is shipped in a slipcase to hold the seven manuals.andO;All are paperbound, and ours cracked their spines almost before we openedthem!andP;  The manuals are an editor reference, language reference, compilerguide, Btrieve manual, two library references, and a tutorial onnetware-loadable modules.andM;The manuals are well written and cover the product in exhaustive detail.andP;  Thefunction reference uses a one-per-page approach and each is well described.andO;The indexes are brief throughout all the manuals, though.andP;  We found thelayout a little confusing and had to search through pages repeatedly.andP;  Eventhough the manuals have been rewritten, we were still lost often enough to bemildly frustrated.andP;  In the end, we preferred the more sterile Watcomdocumentation.andM;The C Network Compiler is shipped on six diskettes.andP;  While not particularlyversatile, the installation routine is clean and fast.andP;  This product isexcellent for those with a Novell network but not for those looking for astand-alone C compiler.andP;  It has no real integrated development environmentand lacks Watcom's debugger and Express C, possibly because of thelimitations of network development.andP;  In any case, this is a specialtyproduct.andM;Rational Systems Instant CandM;Instant C was intended to be a development tool for other compilers: it isbest though of as an interactive C with simple editor and debuggercapabilities.andP;  In fact, it is an incremental compiler (compiling as theprogram is written).andP;  This speeds development time.andP;  Instant C requires afull megabyte of RAM and at least an 80286.andM;The Instant C system is distributed on two 1.2MB diskettes.andP;  Thedocumentation is supplied in a standard-sized, three-ring binder thatcontains the standard user's manual and a new-features release.andP;  These twoparts total about 600 pages.andP;  The manual is cleanly printed on very whitepaper and provides a comprehensive index.andP;  Several screen images arefeatured.andP;  Unfortunately, with the pages of the manual and end-leaf holdersin place, the documentation was too thick for the manual's size: the topcover inevitably stuck up in the air when placed on a desk -- a minorcomplaint, but annoying!andM;Documentation chapters include the overview and installation, the editor,debugger, notes and references to the C language, and chapters on makingchanges to the compiler, real-time programming, interrupt handling, usingInstant C to access 16MB directly, and advice from the experts on coding.andM;The documentation is very well written and presented and neatly organized.andO;This is one of the best manuals of its type we have seen.andP;  The functionreference uses a page-per-function approach and includes a usage summary,notes, return list, cross reference to other commands, and examples.andP;  Theadditional chapters on interrupts, real time, and advice are interesting andcertainly welcome.andP;  A good list of error messages is included.andM;The editor is available either stand-alone or integrated.andP;  It is easy tolearn; a tutorial guides you through the process.andP;  Although fairly simple, itis very clean.andP;  It cannot perform many advanced editing functions but isadequate, considering it is intended for quick-and-dirty coding anddebugging.andM;The debugger integrates with the editor and provides error messages at thetop of the screen.andP;  The debugger is somewhat basic, lacking many features,but for the type of product Instant C is, this is to be expected.andP;  Properprogram debugging would have to be performed in the end compiler.andM;Instant C certainly speeded development when used, primarily due to itscapability as an incremental compiler.andP;  However, the editor and debugger leftus somewhat disappointed.andP;  We would have preferred working with a powerfuleditor and a debugger such as Code View.andP;  When these are added to Instant C,it will be a very serious development system for big programs.andP;  For now, itis great for fast coding and testing, but its memory requirements may holdmany back.andP;  Considering its price and system needs, Instant C is in the realmof the professional, and there the editor and debugger really lose.andP;  Thecompiler, though, is something else: a great idea whose time has not yetcome.andM;Watcom CandM;Watcom C is distributed as two compilers in one package.andP;  One is a fulloptimizing compiler and the other a quick development system compiler calledExpress C.andP;  Neither is a fully integrated development environment, as foundin products such as Turbo C, but all the parts are here: they just lack anice graphical front end.andM;The Watcom C system comes in a cardboard slipcase container containing fivespiral-bound manuals, assorted smaller documents, and loose notes.andP;  themanuals are devoted to a language reference, library reference, graphicslibrary reference, and user guides for both the optimizing compiler andExpress C.andM;The documentation is very well done and the spiral-bound pages lay flat withno problems.andP;  The material was written with obvious care.andP;  The overall toneof the user guides is that of a tutorial.andM;The library reference is excellent.andP;  Each function has its own page and isexplained with descriptions, examples, and return lists.andM;The Watcom C system is provided on nine disks, two for Express C and one forthe debugger.andP;  Installation follows a simple program that copies thediskettes.andM;Express C has some nice error-detection methods that caught errors otherproducts missed.andP;  The debugger is very good and is integrated with theExpress C environment.andP;  The front-end program for the Express C system couldbe improved.andP;  The editor is not remarkable but does meet the basicrequirements.andP;  A good make utility is included, as we expected consideringWatcom's heritage.andM;Watcom C is not a fancy graphics-based system but a solid product for Cdevelopment.andP;  Using Express C first and following with the optimizingcompiler gives a developer the best of both worlds: speed in the early stagesand excellent compiler behavior in the second.andP;  The Watcom C compiler byitself is a winner, but coupling it with the environment makes for an evenbetter package.andP;  Unfortunately, it falls short of being outstanding.andM;Zortech Developer's EditionandM;Zortech's was the only C++ compiler submitted for this review, and while thismay not be a fair comparison in terms of performance and ANSI compatibility,the development environment can be directly compared to the other productsreviewed here.andP;  The C++ package includes two compilers, one for C++ and onefor C.andP;  The developer's edition is shipped with a debugger and tools library.andM;The system is shipped in a large slipcase that includes four paperbackmanuals (compiler reference, function reference, debugger, and tools) and asmaller installation guide.andP;  The manuals are well written and attractivelylaid out.andM;The function reference manual is divided into sections for the differentletters for ease of location.andP;  Page edges are marked with the first letter ofthe function in large type, which sped things up quite a bit.andP;  Each functionincludes a description and usage example.andP;  The functions are listedalphabetically but are not one-per-page.andM;The product is shipped on 12 5 1/2-inch diskettes in a vinyl foldingenvelope.andP;  None of the diskettes had jackets, which we found annoying whenfiling in anything other than the supplied envelope.andM;Installation is automated and easy to follow.andP;  The installation routineprompts for all disks and allows complete control over the installationprocess.andP;  The process is explained in the manual, as are customization andconfiguration.andP;  A floppy version is not supported.andM;The C++ editor is called ZED.andP;  It has mouse support and makes full use of theintegration environment.andP;  Multiple files can be edited simultaneously andmost commands can be customized.andP;  Indeed, this is one of the morecustomizable editors we saw.andP;  Memory-resident help is available from withinthe system for the editor and all of the C++ programs.andM;The debugger is very good, providing mixed C, C++, and assembler debuggingcapabilities.andP;  The debugger makes good use of windows and provides unlimitedbreakpoints, function display, and tracing.andP;  Windows can be used for source,function list, file list, data variables, trace, break- and watch-points,memory and register contents, and symbols.andP;  80x87 users will appreciate theinclusion of 8087 registers and flags in a special window.andM;The integrated environment supports a mouse and uses pull-down menus.andP;  It isconfigurable, as is most of the C++ system.andP;  Its flow is similar to theintegrated development environments used by Borland and Microsoft, but addssome tools neither supports.andM;The Zortech product is pleasing.andP;  Learning to use the editor and debugger issimple, and both are quite capable of performing any tasks a user would want.andO;The compilers work well within the integrated development environment.andP;  Theentire system is worthy of serious consideration.andM;Choosing an environmentandM;Picking a winner in this review is almost impossible.andP;  Certainly all of theproducts that feature full integrated development environments are worthy ofrecommendation.andP;  Some companies, such as Microsoft and Lattice, have years ofloyal customers to keep them going.andM;The full integrated development environments offer a difficult choice.andP;  BothTurbo C and Top-Speed C gained considerable praise from the review team.andO;(Microsoft C is also good, but we tended to eliminate it from ourrecommendations due to its beta nature.)andP;  Either of these will suffice forthose who are not heavy C programmers, but both may fall a little short inoverall power when used by professionals on large projects.andM;The Lattice, Zortech, Watcom, and Microsoft products are all seriousdevelopment tools for the professional.andP;  Any of them will keep developershappy.andP;  We were surprised by the quality of the Zortech C++ product.andM;The other systems offer several difficult choices.andP;  Some, such as the Novellnetwork system and Instant C, are specialty items and appeal only to thosewho need them.andP;  The rest are all capable of satisfying compiler requirements:most fall short in integration and support.andP;  For those wishing to assembletheir own tools, though, these are ideal choices.andM;We were pleasantly surprised by a few of the products.andP;  The Mix Softwaredebugger is an excellent value, and the lack of a full integrated developmentenvironment is not a severe limitation.andP;  The compiler-debugger combination isan excellent starting system at this price.andM;Instant C is sure to appeal to a select market of serious professionals whowill realize that it can speed development time.andP;  We did not use it enough tocompare it to products such as the new Microsoft system, but have to wonderwhether it will survive the competition.andM;Several systems offer UNIX-like capabilities and seem to be designed for UNIXprogrammers.andP;  The Aztec compiler is an excellent example.andM;Overall, none of these systems are bad.andP;  A few lack integrated developmentenvironment capabilities that would be welcome, others suffer fromdocumentation that is not quite complete, but overall this is an excellentbunch of products.andM;Choosing the right compiler-integrated development environment is alwaysdifficult when looking qualitatively instead of using benchmarks for thefastest system.andP;  However, if our team is representative of professionalprogrammers, we have split ourselves between Zortech and Microsoft, withQuick C and TopSpeed for quick programming tasks.andP;  On sheer audacity forprice-performance ratio, we also loved Mix's products!andM;Testing ProcedureandM;The standard machine used for each test was a Dell 325 with 8MB RAM and 300MBhard disk.andP;  All reviewers on the development team also used their ownequipment -- 80286 or 80386 systems with at least 1MB RAM.andM;All the compilers reviewed were supplied in rotation to four or more teammembers.andP;  Most products were reviewed by six people.andP;  Each product wasinstalled and operated exactly as dictated in the manual or disk files withno terminate-and-stay-resident programs or exotic components.andP;  After testingin a pure environment, each compiler was reinstalled on development machinesat the user's whim and operated with normal background programs, utilities,and hardware.andM;The software's development environment was used where available to create andmaintain several different test programs.andP;  The amount of time required forthis process was not recorded quantitatively, but subjective reports ofdifferent development times were requested for each product.andM;Documentation was examined for layout, ease of use, comprehensiveness,understandability, and reference use.andP;  Particular attention was paid to thefunction reference manual since this document is the most frequently usedthroughout the life of a compiler.andP;  The team preferred layouts that gave eachfunction its own page, resulting in rapid location and a less-cluttered look.andM;Installation was assessed for ease of use, versatility, and functionality.andO;All of the compilers allowed users to specify the directories on which thecompiler was to be installed (except for the floppy installation, of course).andO;Almost all used a standard series of directories such as c:\beaders andc:\bin, but all let you provide other directory names.andP;  Developers who usedmore than one C compiler on a machine preferred installing the compilers inseparate directories, such as c:\turbo\beaders, c:\turbo\bin, c:\eco\beaders,and c:\eco\bin, to separate the files.andM;The debuggers and utilities were assessed using the criteria defined in lastyear's C wrap-up (Feb.andP;  1989) and summarized in Table 1.andP;  Each was givensubjective comments by the user.andP;  The overall environment was furtherassessed.andM;Quantitative assessment of the development environment is meaningless: itsease of use and power are not.andP;  We decided against using tables showingcompleteness (or incompleteness) for each product in favor of short summarieswithin the text of this review.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
