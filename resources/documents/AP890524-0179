Beef cattle destined for consumer dinner tables may be able tothrive on low-grade crop residues and fibrous plants that arebarely digestible now. And chickens may be grown in closed,disease-free environments.   The predictions are part of a project by the department'sAgricultural Research Service to highlight some of the possiblechanges that agency scientists see over the next 25 to 50 years.   ``Of course, there are no guarantees that what the scientistsenvision will become reality,'' said R. Dean Plowman, administratorof the agency. ``But based on the research they're involved inright now, it's certainly within the realm of possibility.''</TEXT></DOC>
