She recently published an autobiography, La Toya.; Q. Your bookvividly shows the price of fame in America, but it's absolutely the mosthorrifying, depressing and bleak show business saga I have ever read, or hopeto read.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  West  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  LA TOYA JACKSON  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  WESTCLOSE-UPS; INTERVIEW  </MEMO><TEXT>  A. Well -- the story of the family is depressing, yes, but that doesn't meanshow business has to be that way. It's something that happened in our family.;  Q. You were beaten severely by your father at age 6, watched him beat yourbrothers, and lived the first 25 or so years of your life under a parentalregime of the most extreme psychological coercion. Are you getting sometherapy?;   A. No.;   Q. Why not?;   A. (Pause.) I think the best therapy forme was to write the book. That was very good for me. It took me a long time towrite it. It took me 3 1/2 years; it should have been only a year. Obstacleswere put in my way.;   Q. By whom?;   A. (Silence.);   Q. Your family?;   A.Umm -- yes. They had their ways. Letters from lawyers were flying left andright. Some of the letters were supposed to appear in the book -- I don't knowwhy they're not there, I don't know what happened.;   Q. When did you realizethat their treatment of you was terribly wrong?;   A. When -- well, I knew ata very young age, when I saw what happened to my brothers, that -- it didn'thappen to me until the first grade, I was beaten by my father, and that wasthe last time. . . .;   Q. You say in your book that it was &quot;as if he'd beentransformed into a monster.&quot;;   A. Yes.;   Q. Then later in the book youconnect that image to the monster depicted in your brother Michael's&quot;Thriller&quot; video.;   A. The metamorphosing monster in the video -- that's myfather. I don't know for sure if Michael had that in mind when he made thevideo, but that's what I see.; Q. And after the beating you resolved to becomethe &quot;perfect girl&quot; so it wouldn't happen anymore?;   A. Yes. I believed I haddone something very bad to make him beat me. I was lying there on the floorand I said to myself that I would never again give him cause to hit me. Iwould never make him angry again. I would control myself. It's aself-destructive deal that is common in abused children. My mother wouldalways say about me, &quot;La Toya is the perfect child.&quot; As if it were anaccomplishment. I didn't feel I had any choice.;   Q. All the fame and wealthyou have now -- was it worth it? Would you trade the fame and wealth for. . ..;   A. For a happy childhood? Yes. Definitely!;   Q. Are you happy now?;   A.Yes. Much more than before.;   Q. One theme of your book is the extremeisolation of your family from the &quot;real world.&quot; I wanted to ask you aboutMichael. Isn't it likely that his current isolation will hurt hisextraordinary musical gifts? Not to mention his life?;   A. I don't know whocan say what's best for him. Who am I to say?;   Q. You're his sister.;   A.But he's the only one who really -- yes, I think it's unhealthy.;   Q. Are youin touch with him? Can you tell him that?;   A. I've told him that in thepast. I'm not in touch with him now, no. I'd like to be. He's cut that off.;  Q. What do you see Michael doing when he's, say, 60?;   A. Directing films.And writing musical scores for them.;   Q. When you're ready to retire, whatpersonal accomplishments would you like to look back on?;   A. Great movies.Winning awards -- Grammys, Oscars. And good albums. I would definitely like tomake very successful movies. I admire everything Bette Davis has been in --those type of roles appeal to me very much.;   Q. Are you taking actinglessons?;   A. No. I've been so busy with the book!;   Q. What would you liketo see your book accomplish?;   A. It's important for the truth to be told,and I would like to see the family get back together again.;   Q. But you'reclearly going to hurt people. This isn't a &quot;hey, let's get together again&quot;kind of book.;   A. Why do you say that? (Pause. Sound of a muffledconversation. She hands the phone to a publicity assistant, and the interviewis at an end.)  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Bob Frost  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910929  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  779  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, September 29, 199100273233,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
