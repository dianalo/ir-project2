 That would provide a fix for all the growth junkies fromsemiconductors to software and do wonders for our index of computer-relatedstocks, which has fallen so far so fast that we have trouble keeping it onthe page.andM;Unfortunately, we can't see anything on the horizon that might be big enoughto have that kind of impact.andP;  And moving the discussion from macro to micro,we don't expect any single product to revive the spectacular growthexperienced in the last two decades by Tandy, the country's largest purveyorof consumer electronics products.andM;Tandy's growth has usually coincided with the mass adoption phase of newconsumer products.andP;  The company benefitted from the citizen's band radio boomof the 1970s and again from the personal computer cycle that began in 1981.andO;But in the past few years, despite Tandy's aggressive entry into the cellulartelephone market, there has been no new electronics product strong enough toreturn the growth rate to the 20% levels of the early 1980s.andM;Revenues were up only about 10% in 1988 and 1989 and just 7.6% in fiscal1990.andP;  Tandy has managed to keep its profitability at respectable levels, butearnings dropped 10% this past year, dragging return on equity to 16.6% from19% in 1989.andP;  The stock is at a six-year low.andM;Now that Tandy's revenues are approaching $5 billion, it's not reasonable toexpect any more years of 20% growth.andP;  But we don't think Tandy needs a HulaHoop -- or a CB radio or a PC, for that matter -- to move its growth ratecloser to 15%.andP;  All Tandy's chief executive John Roach has to do is find waysto pull more customers into those thousands of Radio Shacks, exploit recenttrends in niche retailing, broaden and deepen Tandy's position in personalcomputers, and build its reputation as a serious developer and manufacturerof high technology products.andM;Does that sound like a tall order, even for a Texan?andP;  We're not so sure.andO;After a couple of painful years of experimentation, Mr. Roach appears to bemaking progress on all those fronts.andP;  Increasingly, Tandy exhibits thecharacteristics that make the big Japanese companies such formidablecompetitors around the world: manufacturing muscle, vertical integration,broad distribution power, and the ability to forge successful strategicalliances.andM;True, Tandy has its weaknesses, Notably lack-luster performance by the coreRadio Shack retail business.andP;  But we think management has faced up to thefact that parts of the original success formula need fixing, and we see a lotof additional activity that makes eminent sense for a company that ought tobe leading the convergence of consumer electronics and computer technology.andM;Y'all comeandM;The first priority has to be the revival of Radio Shack, which accounted for65% of Tandy's $4.5 billion revenues in fiscal 1990, down from 72% in fiscal1989 and 77% in fiscal 1988 (see the chart on this page).andP;  One reason RadioShack's sales were down slightly in fiscal 1990 was the shift of part of itscomputer business to GRID Systems, acquired in 1989.andP;  However, growth infiscal 1990 for individual Radio Shacks (not including computer centers) inoperation more than one year was less than 1%, following a 3% gain in 1989.andM;The clear implication is that in the absence of strong new consumerelectronics product cycles, growth will accelerate only if a broader audiencecan be enticed to shop at Radio Shack stores.andP;  With more than 7,000 RadioShack retail outlets in the United States (4,830 owned by Tandy, the rest byfranchised dealers) there is limited need for new stores.andP;  Radio Shack mustdraw more customers into the stores it already has.andM;The outlook for enlarging the customer base is brighter since the companyacknowledged the need to change the Radio Shack formula, began to improve itsinformation systems, and augmented the information with targeted marketresearch.andP;  One benefit of the system-wide point-of-sale terminals installedover the past two years is that Tandy is better able to monitor the effect ofmerchandise mix, promotions, and other factors.andM;Smart terminalsandM;By analyzing sales data captured by the POS system, Tandy now has reliableinformation on how price-sensitive its products are (or aren't).andP;  It can seeclearly that certain locations sell more of some items and virtually none ofothers.andP;  That should lead to a customized merchandise mix to reflect theinterests of customers on a store by store basis.andP;  The McDonald's approachclearly won't work anymore in electronics retailing.andM;We also expect Radio Shack to supplement proprietary brands such asRealistic, which does not have a strong franchise with consumers today.andP;  Theintroduction of the new Optimus brand for audio equipment during fiscal 1990is the initial step in an effort to create desirable proprietary brands forRadio Shack that will serve as a magnet to draw new customers.andM;No style pointsandM;Radio Shack's weak points also include old-fashioned advertising, highemployee turnover, and service difficulties.andP;  The advertising issue isprimarily one of style.andP;  Recent television ads we have seen for the new Tandyhome computer have adequately but blandly conveyed their message.andP;  That maynot be good enough as IBM and Apple Computer gear up for Christmas.andP;  TheRadio Shack flyers that come in the mail are the same design the company hasused for many years.andP;  They need a more contemporary look.andM;The turnover and service issues stem in part from the realignment of thecompany's computer marketing.andP;  For the past 18 months, GRiD has beenresponsible for computer sales to national accounts and larger businesseswhile the Radio Shack division handles computer sales to individuals, smalland medium-sized businesses, and education.andP;  As the chart on this page shows,microcomputers now constitute only about a quarter of Radio Shack sales.andM;Integrating the Radio Shack Computer Centers with GRiD has been a difficultprocess, exacerbated by significant employee departures.andP;  The resultingturmoil translated to service problems for some customers, especially thosewho had purchased a computer at a Radio Shack Computer Center that had beentransferred to the GRiD group.andP;  A clear need for Radio Shack, if it is to besuccessful in the home market for personal computers, is to make the serviceand support process as painless as possible for the customer and as efficientas possible for the store.andM;Reach and graspandM;With the acquisitions of GRiD and Victor Technologies, Tandy produces one ofthe broadest product lines in the microcomputer industry.andP;  We counted 55configurations in a recent listing, with microprocessor performance rangingfrom an 8-MHz 8086 to a 25-MHz 80486.andP;  The form factors vary from the 4.5-lb.andO;portable GRiDPad that recognizes handwritten input to the tower andfileserver units marketed by Victor in Europe.andM;It is increasingly clear that Tandy intends to be a major computer supplier,both under its own name and as an OEM supplier through an array ofdistribution channels.andP;  It sold 547,000 IBM-compatible personal computers infiscal 1990, up 26% from 1989.andP;  About a third were portables, or businessdesktops (see the chart on Page 4).andM;Home sweet homeandM;Tandy has never positioned itself as first to market with new processors, butsince embracing the MS-DOS operating system the company has managedreasonably timely market entries based on the ever-faster processors thatdominate the headlines, if not the buyers' pocketbooks.andP;  We think the GRiDdivision offers the opportunity for Tandy to earn a reputation as atechnology leader if it can continue to innovate in laptops and notebooks.andM;A consistent thread in Tandy's computer marketing has been its focus on thehome market, and the opportunity there seems larger than it has for sometime.andP;  IBM's PS/1 and Apple's forthcoming low-end models are likely tostimulate buying interest, some of which will spill over to Tandy.andP;  SinceTandy's Radio Shack customers are nothing if not price-sensitive, the obviousway to sell them computers is to provide good value.andP;  The newest model in thecompany's 1000 series, the RL, carries a $750 entry price along with theproprietary Deskmate interface that should be non-threatening to noviceusers.andM;Distinctions and differencesandM;It's important to note that Tandy and IBM have defined the home user quitedifferently.andP;  IBM bundles Microsoft Works and the Prodigy electronicinformation service with its PS/1, implying that the customer is thinking interms of office uses.andP;  The PS/1 is more powerful than the 1000 RL but itcosts more.andP;  Conversely, Tandy has targeted applications that address thethings people actually do at home, such as referring to telephone lists andbalancing a checkbook.andM;Sales of the 1000 RL have been ahead of plan and particularly strong in thethree markets where the PS/1 has been test marketed.andP;  Now that the PS/1 isavailable nationwide, we think that Tandy can capitalize on consumerawareness of computers in the home and do well with the 1000 RL.andM;What Sears hath wroughtandM;We're not sure how long Tandy can stick with its proprietary-brand concept inthe Radio Shack chain.andP;  The fact that even mighty Sears Roebuck has abandonedthat approach and begun to carry name-brand merchandise under the BrandCentral banner is a sobering development.andP;  Obviously, the only way a retailercan prosper with proprietary brands is to maintain their vitality andquality; once their image is tarnished, buyer confidence may never return.andM;Assuming that the Radio Shack formula won't be junked right away, areasonable growth strategy for Tandy would include wider participation inniche retail markets, with new store formats and merchandise mixes.andP;  Thecompany has tinkered with this concept in the past.andP;  Some of the efforts havebeen successful; others have not.andP;  Still, what little growth Tandy hasmustered recently has come from the new channels it has either acquired orbuilt internally.andM;Wrong numberandM;One concept that didn't work was the creation of separate centers to sell andinstall telephone systems in small businesses and homes.andP;  Since Tandy had tocontract the installation with local installers, growth was constrained andthe transactions were too complex to fit Tandy's structure.andP;  Eventually thetelephone stores were folded into the Radio Shack stores and computercenters.andP;  While telephones and related equipment have accounted for about11.5% of Radio Shack's sales for the past three years, they did not provide aviable niche market for a separate chain of stores.andM;On the other hand, Tandy has become successful in name-brand retailing, underthe McDuff and Video Concepts names, largely through dogged persistence.andO;During the past six years, Tandy's name-brand retail division has also servedas a laboratory for the development of additional retailing concepts.andP;  Thename-brand group has grown from $12 million in revenues in fiscal 1985 to$470 million in fiscal 1990.andP;  It is now quite profitable despite much lowergross margins than the company average (32% in fiscal 1990 versus RadioShack's 53%).andM;After a painful learning curve, management learned that its initial strategyof offering proprietary models of name-brand items was not what the publicwanted.andP;  Surprisingly enough, shoppers wanted the products they saw incompetitors' stores.andP;  Recently the division has become more profitable andits sales growth in existing stores (19% in fiscal 1990 for stores inoperation a year or more) rivals or exceeds the growth of other majorconsumer electronics retailers, such as Circuit City.andM;What's in a nameandM;There is still considerable opportunity for growth in name-brand retailing,since it remains a fragmented industry with a plethora of mom-and-pop storesin most areas of the country.andP;  Tandy's name-brand retail group, which nownumbers 322, primarily in and around 11 hub markets, will open about 50 newstores in time for the 1990 Christmas selling season.andP;  The fragmentation ofthe market and the relatively low store-count suggest that continued storeexpansion will provide Tandy's name brand division with strong growth overthe next several years.andM;Upscale modelandM;Having explored the world beyond Radio Shack, Tandy plans to initiate a newgroup of stores later this year that will sell higher priced personalelectronic products in shopping malls.andP;  The Radio Shack product mix favorslow priced items.andP;  In fiscal 1990, the average Radio Shack store carried2,956 items, of which 2,670 retailed for less than $50.andP;  Only 51 items hadretail prices above $200.andM;The upscale market that is served by such niche retailers as Brookstone orThe Sharper Image presents one opportunity for Tandy.andP;  Tandy has enormousworldwide purchasing power with the vendors of gadgets that appeal to earlyadopters willing to pay premium prices for the newest toy.andP;  Although unitvolumes aren't large, high margins usually accompany introductory phases ofelectronic product retailing.andP;  If Tandy's new group is successful, we thinkthe company could follow the example of The Limited, which has developedmultiple niches in women's apparel from Lane Bryant to Victoria's Secret.andM;Nobody asked us, but...andM;We have wondered if Tandy could also make a successful business out ofselling software.andP;  To date, the software selection in its stores has beenskimpy.andP;  Radio Shack offers quick delivery of additional software that isstocked in Tandy's regional warehouses, and Tandy is considering how it mightexpand its Tandy Express order service to include additional categories ofmerchandise.andP;  But that is not the same thing as focusing a profit center onsoftware marketing.andP;  Mail order might provide another attractive distributionchannel for Tandy.andP;  If so, software would be one likely merchandise category.andM;Thor subjectandM;Tandy's trump card may turn out to be, of all things, technology.andP;  Two yearsago Tandy announced it would develop an optical disk product intended to bethe consumer sector's first erasable CD player.andP;  The so-called Thor productuses a technology called dye-polymer, in which a laser changes thereflectivity of the disk material.andP;  There is still some question in theoptical storage research community whether the technology is stable andreliable enough for multiple read/write applications, first in the consumeraudio sector and later as a computer data storage device.andM;For whatever reason, Thor has been delayed and may be postponed still furtherif digital audio tape becomes a successful product in the United States inthe next year.andP;  Nevertheless, Tandy's involvement in the development of theThor CD has cemented its credibility as a serious developer of consumerelectronics products.andP;  This has opened the door to significant strategicalliances, especially in digital recording.andM;We think Tandy has opportunities to expand beyond its current alliances(which include Matsushita and Digital Equipment) to work with importantdevelopers of multimedia products.andP;  Although there are as many definitions ofmultimedia as there are definers, it is clear that another conjunction ofconsumers and technology is in the making.andP;  Consumer multimedia products,which include computing power, video, storage, sound, and interactivity, canbecome a multibillion dollar market some time in the 1990s.andP;  It is certainlyan opportunity that is well suited to Tandy's manufacturing and distributionstrengths.andM;Patents wildandM;In addition to providing the basis for important strategic alliances, Tandy'sincreasing willingness to participate in early stage product research shouldgenerate more bargaining chips in the high-stakes patent game.andP;  Asintellectual property litigation impinges on more technology companies, oneof the conditions for future success will be the ownership of desirablepatent portfolios to trade for the rights to manufacture products without theburden of significant royalty payments.andM;Swap meetandM;The acquisition of GRiD brought Tandy the patent for the clamshell hingeddesign for portable computers.andP;  Since most major hardware manufacturers willuse the clamshell design, Tandy is in a strong trading position as it pushesinto the fast-growing laptop market.andP;  Tandy is licensing the GRiD patents andwill receive meaningful royalties from those licenses.andM;On the down side, Tandy has had to pay Motorola a significant sum for usingMotorola-patented technology in its cellular telephones.andP;  Tandy is currentlyin litigation with Texas Instruments regarding patents covering the bus forsome personal computers.andP;  The outcome of that litigation is uncertain, butTandy has been able to increase end-user prices to compensate for royaltypayments, and it does have some patents for possible exchange with TI.andM;Wakeup callandM;As a result of its growing competence in technology, manufacturing, anddistribution, Tandy is uniquely positioned to reawaken the potentially hugehome market.andP;  Creative use of its multiple resources could yield the firstreal home information appliance some time in the 1990s.andP;  The handwritingrecognition and portability of the GRiDPad, for example, could be refined toyield a small, powerful unit that could attach to the front of a refrigeratoror sit easily on the table where the daily mail is put.andP;  With the rightsoftware, we think the question of computer utility in the home would soonbecome moot.andM;Tandy now has the opportunity to combine its own hardware with anindustry-standard operating system, some proprietary system software(Deskmate) and unique applications to reach a new class of users.andP;  The safetynet is that if customers want to use only MS-DOS and third-partyapplications, they can.andP;  However, if the 1000 RL and subsequent Tandy customcomputers are successful, the company will have inaugurated a market nichethat can be large and profitable.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
