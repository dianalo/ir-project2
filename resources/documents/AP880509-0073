More than 80 tornadoes or tornado-like storms touched downSunday _ 32 in Illinois, 25 in Wisconsin and 22 in Iowa and oneeach in Indiana and Arkansas, and at least 160 reports ofthunderstorms with wind gusts over 50 mph, some with baseball-sizedhail, the weather service said.   One man, a 39-year-old construction worker, was killed Sundaynight when a house he was building collapsed on him in high windsin Crown Point, Ind., about 15 miles south of Gary, officials saidtoday.   Sunday marked the region's second day of violent weather. Inrural Gretna, Neb., a 29-year-old woman and her 2-year-old daughterdied after a tornado struck their mobile home Saturday night.   Storm damage reports covered eastern Kansas, northeast Texas,from Arkansas through southern Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois andwestern Kentucky.   In eastern Iowa, more than 5,000 Iowa-Illinois Gas andamp; ElectricCo. customers were without power for several hours Sunday, andseveral thousand Iowa Power And Light Co. customers were blackedout in the Des Moines area.   A car show near Rockford, Ill., ended as 81-mph winds tossedtents, debris, and portable toilets. ``One outhouse flew right pastme and then I got hit by another one as I was running away,'' saidDwight Dunlop, 21.   The winds toppled a 60-foot-by-180-foot big top tent and pulledout dozens of metal stakes that were driven into the ground. A signreading, ``Not responsible for damage,'' was all that remainedstanding.   At Winsome Park, a nearby apartment complex, high winds lifted a10-car garage away from the vehicles it sheltered and threw it intoanother building.   In the Chicago area, winds gusted up to 55 mph, downing treesand wires. Commonwealth Edison officials said high winds causedelectricity to be cut off to about 40,000 people in the Chicagoarea, but by midmorning power had been restored to all but about6,000 customers.   An air traffic controller at Chicago's Midway Airport complainedof a sandstorm as strong winds swept through the city. Midway andO'Hare airport officials said some flights were delayed by thestorm.   Mort Edelstein, a spokesman for the Federal AviationAdministration, said the weather-related problems were compoundedby a major fire at an Illinois Bell switching center in suburbanHinsdale.   ``The regular telephone lines linking the Chicago-area (air)control center in Aurora with the towers at Midway and O'Hare gothrough Hinsdale,'' Edelstein explained. ``Both towers switchedimmediately to backup communications systems, but the bad weatherwas nearing Midway, so approaches there were stopped.''   Edelstein said that after the worst of the weather passed,planes were allowed to take off from Midway, and the airport wasreopened to approaching flights after several hours. There waslittle effect on O'Hare, he said.   A tornado touched down near Elwood, Ill., southwest of Jolietshortly after 7 p.m. Sunday, tearing the roof off a condominium,but no injuries were reportd, the National Weather Service said.   In East Peoria, high winds ripped part of the roof off a popularseafood restaurant, doing an estimated $200,000 damage. Authoritiessaid about 225 diners were inside the restaurant at the time, butno one was injured.   In north-central Wisconsin, two people were hospitalized withinjuries after high winds with rain and hail struck their mobilehomes in Marathon County. The extent of their injuries was notimmediately known.   ``We've had several roofs blown off, power lines knocked down,numerous reports of trees down, I'd say 20 or 30 reports,'' saidJack Burbank, a civil defense official for Columbia County, justsouth of Marathon.   Thunderstorms with high winds rumbled across the northern halfof Indiana on Sunday, damaging buildings in Benton County andLebanon and injuring one person when a mobile home was blown overin Wabash County, authorities said.
