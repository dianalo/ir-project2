The CIA report, a small portion of which was declassifiedby Director William Webster, will add fuel to the politicalfirestorm over which officials and agencies were aware ofBCCI's surreptitious involvement in U.S. banking, and why noaction was taken. The CIA itself did some banking with BCCI.First American Bankshares, then known as Financial GeneralBankshares, is the capital city's largest bank holdingcompany.                                                                                                          The CIA report, the earliest explicit warning yet tosurface that BCCI had moved into First American, wascirculated to several law enforcement and regulatoryagencies, including the Treasury, Commerce and Justicedepartments, according to government officials.   Some officials who were aware of the report have assertedthat it contained little meaningful information. This meansthat the officials either ignored or failed to grasp thesignificance of the CIA's assertion that the rogue bank,which had been specifically denied authority to buy into U.S.banks, had, in fact, done so, and on a level that made it oneof the most significant players in the industry and in thenation's capital.   The declassified section of the report recounts how BCCI,a unit of BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A., in 1981 attemptedto buy what was then known as Financial General Bankshares.BCCI was barred form the purchase by regulators, but, thereport says, &quot;BCCI achieved this goal six months later.&quot; Thereport acknowledges that &quot;the exact nature of this controlwas unclear.&quot;   In the years after 1986, BCCI on occasion drew significantsums from First American. In one instance, BCCI drew fundsfrom First American by having the bank purchase anotherinstitution secretly controlled by BCCI, National Bank ofGeorgia, on generous terms of at least $220 million.   Separately, government officials in Pakistan said theywould refuse any request to extradite Agha Hasan Abedi, thefounder of BCCI, who was indicted Monday by a grand jury inNew York for fraud, grand larceny and falsification ofbusiness records. Pakistani Chief Minister Jam Sadiq Ali toldthe Associated Press he considered BCCI's July 5 seizure byregulators in several countries to have been engineered bythe West and Israel.   The indictment also continued to send shock waves throughPeru, where two former central bank officials were paid $3million in bribes by BCCI in exchange for central bankdeposits, according to the indictment. Felipe Osterling, thepresident of the Peruvian Senate, said the body would open aninvestigation into the conditions under which the country'sreserves were placed in BCCI. In addition, Jorge ChavezAlvarez, president of the central bank, said his institutionis looking into all deposits of reserves in foreign banksover the past several years.   In a 100-page report released this week, the FederalReserve listed the means by which BCCI used Middle Easternmoney men as nominees through which to gain its controllinginterest in First American and, in turn, to build a financialempire in the U.S. that eventually included Independence Bankof Encino, Calif., and a stake in Florida's largest savingsand loan association, CenTrust Bank.   In Washington, Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass), who engineeredthe declassification of the CIA information, lambasted thegovernment agencies that had seen it five years earlier.&quot;BCCI's secret ownership of First American was illegal,&quot; saidMr. Kerry, whose subcommittee on terrorism and narcotics willhold hearings today on the BCCI affair. &quot;Despite the factthat a number of agencies were told about the secretownership of First American by BCCI, apparently no one didanything about it. The question is, why?&quot;   Secretary of State James Baker headed the TreasuryDepartment in 1986. In Moscow, an aide said Mr. Baker, whohas been accompanying President Bush to his summit meetingwith Mikhail Gorbachev, wasn't available for comment.   Robert Kimmitt, undersecretary of state who served asgeneral counsel at the Treasury in 1986, said, &quot;I don't haveany recollection of it at all.&quot; Mr. Kimmitt said such areport from the CIA would usually have gone to the Treasury'senforcement division, or to the office of the Comptroller ofthe Currency, and might not have reached his level or Mr.Baker's. Mr. Baker left the Treasury in 1988.   A Treasury spokeswoman said last night that the departmentdoesn't comment on alleged communications that may or may nothave taken place between the CIA and the Treasury.   ---   Walter S.
