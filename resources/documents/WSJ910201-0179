The congressionally mandated study is expected to affectthe Bush administration's initiative to control theproliferation of such weapons. It also is likely to influencethe joint effort by the U.S. and its allies to revise theirrules on Soviet technology trade.</LP><TEXT>   An earlier academy study helped establish some of thecurrent U.S. export-control policies. The new report wasprepared by a 22-member panel of scientists, academics andformer U.S. government officials. The panel is headed byRoland Schmitt, president of Rensselaer PolytechnicInstitute.   The panel argued that Western authorities are better ableto distinguish between civilian and military buyers in theSoviet Union because that country has become more open. Maj.Gen. William Burns, a retired U.S. Arms Control andDisarmament Agency official and the panel's vice chairman,said that stronger business ties with the Soviet Union andthe success of arms-control verification measures help makesuch distinctions easier. The panel said exports that couldassist the Soviet military should remain under strictcontrols.   The report also warned the Bush administration againstrelying too much on unilateral anti-proliferation controls,stressing that they can succeed only if the Western allies,as well as the Soviet Union and China, fully back thecontrols.   The Soviet Union and China, both active sellers ofmissiles to the Third World, haven't yet signed on to any ofthe multilateral accords controlling trade in the technologyfor making weapons.   The academy report also noted that none of theanti-proliferation accords cover other potential war-makingequipment such as &quot;smart&quot; targeting devices, advancedsurveillance vehicles and command-and-control systems.   The panel, seeking an end to excessive bureaucraticrivalry, urged the consolidation of routine licensing in theCommerce Department's Bureau of Export Administration and thecreation of an interagency panel, under the president'snational security adviser, to set policies and resolve casedisputes. The State Department and the Pentagon currentlyoversee some licensing.   If Western governments adopt the academy's proposals onliberalizing Soviet trade, the Soviet market for Westerncomputers and other data-processing equipment couldsignificantly improve.   &quot;Toaster factories and farm cooperatives over there wouldneed the same kind of computers that we use to run our ownbusinesses,&quot; said Edward Black, vice president of theComputer and Communications Industry Association, aWashington-based group representing major U.S. computermanufacturers.</TEXT></DOC>
