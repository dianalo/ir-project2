The ultimate beneficiary of the moves may be Vice President George Bush.    Mr. Hodel announced he is delaying scheduled sales of leases for oil and gas rights in federal waters off the coasts of Florida and New England; both lease sales are strongly opposed by environmentalists and certain state officials and congressmen.    Similarly, he deferred a lease sale last week off the northern California coast after Mr. Bush, the certain Republican candidate for president, reversed himself on the oil-drilling issue and called for just such a delay while campaigning before the California presidential primary.    While Mr. Hodel made no mention of the Republican presidential candidate in announcing his latest plans, both delays work to Mr. Bush's benefit. One diffuses a potential campaign conflict between Mr. Bush and Michael Dukakis, the likely Democratic presidential candidate, over oil and gas drilling in the Georges Bank area off the New England coast. Mr. Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, opposes drilling there -- partly because it is a prime fishing ground.    And the interior secretary's action concerning Florida fulfills a wish made by that state's Republican governor, Bob Martinez, who has asked for Mr. Bush's help in getting the government to re-examine leases off his state's coast.    Mr. Bush, a former Texas oil man, has planned to make a campaign issue of promises to do more for the environment than President Reagan has.    An aide to Mr. Hodel said the Bush campaign hadn't asked the interior secretary to delay the lease sales, but Mr. Hodel is viewed as an astute and active GOP campaigner. And Mr. Bush's aides privately have praised the secretary's earlier decision affecting California as a helpful move that they hope other administration officials might imitate.    Conservative Westerners have mentioned the interior secretary as a possible running mate for Mr. Bush, although political experts dismiss that as unlikely.    Mr. Hodel's decision to delay the lease sales dismayed officials in the oil and gas industry. &quot;The industry is very disappointed that the administration has thrown in the towel,&quot; said Stephen Chamberlain, director of exploration for the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group.    Mr. Hodel, who has advocated an aggressive offshore leasing policy to bolster U.S. energy independence, said he was delaying the lease sales to provide more time to work out a consensus with local officials who have raised objections.    Meanwhile, the House Appropriations Committee voted yesterday to restrict drilling in the Florida, New England and northern California tracts through Sept. 30, 1989.    Mr. Hodel's action delays lease sale 96 off New England for at least six months; bids were to have been taken in February 1989. At Gov. Martinez's request, some 14 million acres off Florida's Gulf coast will be removed from lease sale 116 and delayed; leasing of the remaining 46.4 million will go ahead as scheduled in November. </TEXT></DOC>
