Parts of Arkansas flooded since May 1 were declared a federaldisaster area by President Bush as National Guardsmen labored toshore up a weakened levee protecting a small town from the RedRiver, which continued its steady climb toward a 45-year high.   In neighboring Louisiana, residents stacked sandbags aroundhomes near the Red River and some evacuated.   ``It's bad,'' said Rep. Jim McCrery, R-La., who toured theflooded regions. ``It's the worst flood we've had here in mylifetime.''   Elsewhere, creeks and rivers rose sharply in western and centralMissouri, including the Kansas City area, as thunderstormscontinued to dump heavy rain throughout the region. Many streetswere flooded and more rain was expected.   Residents of low-lying areas along the Trinity River insoutheastern Texas braced for the worst as engineers at LakeLivingston Dam cranked open the taps to release a record flow of88,000 cubic feet per second to protect the dam from a recordflood. Releases of more than 20,000 cfs cause at least someflooding below the dam.   The river's crest was expected to reach the dam by Wednesday,and releases could reach 100,000 cfs that day or Thursday, causingthe worst flooding in 80 years in the small communities downstream.   Lt. Gen. Henry Hatch of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers flewover the area Tuesday and said the Lake Livingston Dam appeared tobe working as planned.   Meanwhile, Gov. Bill Clements asked federal officials to addfour more Texas counties to the 29 listed in a presidentialdisaster declaration issued earlier this month because of floodingand storm damage.   Many residents of communities south of the dam heeded earlywarnings and moved to higher ground, although there were lastminute stragglers who called for help as water covered the roadsout of their subdivisions.   ``They chose to stay ... now they've become frightened and theywant out,'' said Jim Mitchum, Liberty County emergency managementcoordinator, adding that people were helped by the early warnings.   Flooding along the Trinity began two weeks ago in theDallas-Fort Worth area, forcing hundreds of people from their homes.   The flooding and storms that caused the flooding killed 12people in Texas and one in Oklahoma, and could cause up to $700million in agricultural damage in Texas alone, officials estimate.   In Arkansas, agencies differed on the numbers of houses affectedby flooding on the Arkansas and Red rivers. The state Office ofEmergency Services estimated 493 houses sustained some kind offlood damage, said spokesman Gary Talley. Red Cross spokesman DavidThrekelsen said their count stood at 337 but that surveys werecontinuing.   The president's disaster declaration makes federal fundingavailable through the Federal Emergency Management Agency tosupplement the recovery of residents and businesses in Crawford,Faulkner, Jefferson, Little River, Perry, Pulaski and Sebastiancounties.   The disaster declaration was requested last week by Gov. BillClinton, who renewed the requested Tuesday, saying, ``devastatingflooding unprecedented in recent history continues to this day.''   Clinton estimated that losses to public and private propertywill exceed $20 million.   Sandbagging continued in earnest on a weakened levee protectingthe town of Garland, Ark., from the Red River, said Talley. Theriver had crested in the area, he said, but it probably will belate Wednesday before it receded.   National Guard Maj. David Lively said sandbagging along the RedRiver could continue until the weekend.   If the levee breaks near an Army Corps of Engineers' commandpost at Garland, a town of about 600 people, ``we'll have time tosound a horn and tell people to get out,'' said Lt. Bob Page of theMiller County sheriff's office.   In Louisiana, about 300 homes have been evacuated along the RedRiver from Shreveport southward as the river climbed toward a45-year high.   Emergency workers ringed homes with sandbags in a low-lying areaof Shreveport, where the Red was expected to crest Wednesday at34.8 feet, about 5 feet above flood stage. That will be higher thana 1957 flood, but not a record.   Water is expected to cover 600 square miles, including 200square miles of cropland, said Maj. Jack Scherer of the Corps ofEngineers in Shreveport.   Water continued to recede in southern and eastern Oklahoma butadditional localized flooding threatened an area of northernOklahoma after thunderstorms dumped more than 7 inches of rainovernight on Elgin, Kan., a small town just across theKansas-Oklahoma line.   That much water ``means some rises on some of the local creeksand rivers but it's a situation where the rainfall is verylocalized, so we really don't expect any widespread flooding,''said David Andra of the National Weather Service in Norman, Okla.   In Mississippi, the National Weather Service said the Leaf andBowie rivers should drop below flood stage by Wednesday, allowing37 people who went to a Red Cross Shelter Monday at the Universityof Southern Mississippi Sports Arena at Hattiesburg to return home.   Hattiesburg received 7.97 inches of rain from Saturday nightthrough Tuesday morning.</TEXT></DOC>
