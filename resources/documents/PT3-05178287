Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates in general to an apparatus for supporting      items in storage. In particular, the present invention relates to a      collapsible device for storing items, particularly apparel and clothing      accessories. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Related Art </PAR><PAR>  Various devices have been known for storing apparel accessories such as      ties, belts, scarves and necklaces. With regard to ties, a common device      is a mounting plate having a row of cantilevered rods extending outwardly      therefrom. One or more ties are then draped over each of these      cantilevered rods. While this arrangement requires little space for the      storage of the ties, it is difficult to see or remove the ties which have      been draped over the rods. The provision of tie hangers interposed between      the tie and the rod eliminates this problem to a certain extent, however      those ties which are not outermost are still difficult to see. </PAR><PAR>  A similar arrangement has been available for necklaces in the form of      jewelry trees having numerous different designs. In general, these trees      include a plurality of hooks or cantilevered rods upon which the necklaces      or jewelry are draped. Such jewelry trees suffer the visibility problems      noted above, and it is often difficult to remove a particular necklace      from such a tree. </PAR><PAR>  Scarves are often hung one upon the other on a hook extending outwardly      from the wall. Another common method of storing scarves is to place folded      scarves within a drawer. With each of these methods it is apparent that it      is difficult to view the scarves which are not uppermost. In addition,      storing folded scarves within a drawer often causes wrinkling of the      scarves. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  An object of the present invention is to provide a support rack which      requires minimal storage space. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the present invention is to provide a support rack which      allows all of the stored items to be easily viewed. </PAR><PAR>  A further object of the present invention is to provide a support rack      which allows the items supported thereon to be easily removed. </PAR><PAR>  These and other objects are achieved by a collapsible support rack having a      mounting member adapted to be placed on a vertical wall and a support      member, attached to the mounting member, adapted to support the objects      intended to be stored. </PAR><PAR>  The support member includes a plurality of rods spaced outwardly from the      mounting member. The support member is movable between a lowered position      in which the support member hangs downwardly from the mounting member such      that the rods are substantially horizontally extending and vertically      spaced, and a raised position in which the support member extends      outwardly from the vertical wall such that the rods are horizontally      extending but at least somewhat horizontally spaced. Means are also      provided for releasably locking the support member in the raised position. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  The objects and features of the invention noted above are explained in more      detail with reference to the drawings, in which like reference numerals      denote like elements, and in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the support rack of the present invention      in the lowered position; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a front view of the support rack of the present invention in the      lowered position; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a side view of the support rack of FIG. 2; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a side view of the support rack in the raised position. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  With reference to FIG. 1, the device according to the present invention is      generally referenced by numeral 10. The device 10 comprises a mounting      member 12 and a support member 14. </PAR><PAR>  The mounting member 12 is adapted to be mounted upon a surface, such as a      vertical wall or door, such that the device 10 may be easily viewed and      used. </PAR><PAR>  The mounting member 12 includes a substantially planar rear plate 16 which      is adapted to abut the vertical wall. Although indicated as planar, rear      plate 16 could of course take other configurations to conform to the      surface upon which the device 10 is to be mounted. Rear plate 16 may also      include appropriate through holes 18 to allow the rear plate to be fixed      to the vertical wall by screws, although the rear plate could be fixed by      other means, such as magnets or adhesives. </PAR><PAR>  Mounting member 12 also includes a front plate 20. The front plate 20 is      spaced from the rear plate 16 by a transition member 22, such that the      front plate 20 will be spaced from the vertical wall when the mounting      member 12 is attached thereto. Front plate 20 therefore defines an outer      face 24 and an inner face 26. Front plate 20 also includes a pair of      horizontally spaced mounting slots 28 which extend through the front plate      20. </PAR><PAR>  The mounting member 12 may advantageously be formed of a single piece of      metal which is appropriately stamped and bent to form the mounting member.      The mounting member 12 could also be formed of ceramics or plastics or      other materials, including composites. To ensure that the mounting member      12 is sufficiently rigid and maintains the front plate 20 spaced from the      vertical wall, the mounting member 12 may be reinforced by a spacer member      30 extending rearwardly from the lower edge of the front plate 20 back to      the vertical wall. </PAR><PAR>  An auxiliary rear plate 32 may extend downwardly from the inner end of the      spacer member 30 such that the auxiliary rear plate will abut against the      vertical wall in a manner similar to rear plate 16. Appropriate through      holes 34, similar to tyrough holes 18, may extend through the auxiliary      rear plate 32 to allow screws to be passed through the auxiliary rear      plate and into the vertical wall. </PAR><PAR>  For reasons made clear below, it is preferred that the spacer member 30 be      spaced horizontally inwardly from the horizontally spaced mounting slots      28. Alternatively, the spacer member 30 could have appropriate openings      adjacent the mounting slots 28. </PAR><PAR>  The support member 14 includes an elongated central strut 36. The elongated      central strut 36 defines a longitudinal axis along which a plurality of      rods 38 are spaced. The rods 38 extend substantially perpendicular to the      longitudinal axis of central strut 36 and extend substantially      horizontally and parallel to the plane of the vertical wall. As each of      the rods 38 is mounted to the central strut 36 at substantially the      midpoint of the rod, the ends of each of the rods are free. This will      allow the items to be stored to be easily placed upon, and removed from,      the rods 38, as is discussed more fully below. </PAR><PAR>  To improve aesthetic appearance and reduce the possibility of damaging the      items to be stored, the free ends of the rods 38 may include tips 40      formed of an appropriate rubber or plastic. The portion of central strut      36 which extends beyond the spaced rods 38 may also be covered by a strut      tip 42 of an appropriate rubber or plastic material. </PAR><PAR>  A first end 44 of central strut 36 is connected to a crossbar 46. The      crossbar 46 extends substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis      to the central strut 36 and is substantially parallel to the rods 38. The      outer ends of the crossbar 46 each include a hook means 48 for attachment      of the support member 14 to the mounting member 12. </PAR><PAR>  Each of the hook means 48 is generally in the form of a hook having a free      end 50 which may be inserted through the mounting slots 28 from the outer      face 24 of the front plate 20. As shown in FIGS. 1-3, when the free end 50      of the hook means 48 has been inserted through the mounting slots 28, the      support member 14 will hang downwardly from the mounting member 12. This      arrangement defines the support position of the support member 14. In this      position, the articles supported upon the rods 38 for storage may be      easily viewed. </PAR><PAR>  As is best shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, the free ends 50 of the hook means may      have a length such that they extend below the lower edge of the front      plate 20. Spacing the lateral ends of the spacer member 30 inwardly of the      mounting slots, as discussed above, will thus eliminate fouling of the      free ends 50 on the spacer member 30. Lengthening the front plate 20 in      the vertical direction, such that mounting slots 28 are spaced further      from the spacer member 30, would of course eliminate the need to reduce      the width of the spacer member 30. </PAR><PAR>  As noted above, the hook means 48 include free ends 50. In addition, each      of the hook means 48 include a curved portion 52 inwardly of the free end      50. This curved portion 52 leads into an abutment section 54 which is      connected to the crossbar 46. This abutment section 54 allows the support      member 14 to be placed in the raised position. </PAR><PAR>  The raised position of the support member 14 is shown in FIG. 4. In this      position, the entirety of the hook means 48 have been inserted through the      mounting slots 28. The central strut 36 extends outwardly from the      vertical wall in this position, and is held in this outwardly extending      position by abutment segment 54 abutting against the inner face 26, above      the mounting slots 28, of the front plate 20. Additional support is also      to be provided by the abutment segment 54 abutting against the lower edge      of the mounting slots 28. In this manner, the support member 14 is      releasably held in the raised position. </PAR><PAR>  To ensure that the lower edge of the hook means 48 abuts against the lower      edge of the mounting slots 28, a hook extension 56 may be formed between      the crossbar 46 and the curved portion 52 of the hook means, with this      hook extension 56 abutting against the lower edge of the mounting slot 28. </PAR><PAR>  As may be readily envisioned, when the device 10 is in the raised position      shown in FIG. 4, the articles intended to be stored thereon, such as ties,      scarves, belts, towels or necklaces, may be individually draped over      associated ones of the rods 38. As is shown in FIG. 4, the rods 38 are at      least horizontally spaced, and are preferably both horizontally and      vertically spaced, when the support member 14 is in the raised position.      This horizontal spacing of the rods 38 allows sufficient room such that an      article stored upon one of the rods 38 may be removed from, or placed on,      this rod 38 without disturbing the articles hung upon adjacent ones of the      rods 38. As such, the raised position of the support member 14 is employed      when access to the articles hung upon the rods 38 is desired. </PAR><PAR>  Once the desired access to the articles hung upon the rods 38 has been      completed, the support member 14 is moved to the storage or lowered      position, shown in FIGS. 1-3. To effect this, the central strut 36 is      simply raised slightly by hand such that the hook means 48 (or hook      extension 56) disengages from the lower edge of the mounting slot 28. Due      to the weight of the support member 14, the hook means 48 will slide      downwardly such that the curved portion 52 of the hook means 48 engages      the lower edge of the mounting slots 28. At this point, the outer end of      the central strut 36 is lowered until the support member hangs freely by      the hook means 48 retained within the mounting slots 28. </PAR><PAR>  In this lowered position, it may be readily envisioned that the articles      hung upon the rods 38 will be partly visible. It is also noted that, as      shown in FIG. 3, the device 10 has a small profile when the support member      14 is in the lowered position. As such, the device 10 with articles hung      thereon will use a minimum of storage space. </PAR><PAR>  It is of course evident to those of ordinary skill in the art that various      modifications could be made to the present invention. For example, the      first end 44 of the central strut 36 could be extended beyond the crossbar      46. In such a situation it may be necessary to provide appropriate through      holes 58 in front plate 20 to ensure that the extension of the central      strut 36 does not prohibit the entry of the hook means 48 into the      mounting slots 28 when the support member 14 is placed in the raised      position. </PAR><PAR>  Additionally, the support member 114 may be formed of a wide variety of      materials. Metal rods bent to the appropriate shape and welded together is      a preferred method of forming the support member 14, although plastics and      other materials may be employed. Additionally, the number, size and cross      sectional configuration of the rods 38 could, of course, be varied.      Finally, although the rods 38 have been shown as extending substantially      straight, the rods could be bent at their outer ends to help prevent the      articles from slipping off of the rods 38, or could include other bends      and configurations suitable for particular objects or articles intended to      be hung thereon. </PAR><PAR>  From the foregoing it will be seen that this invention is one well adapted      to attain all ends and objects hereinabove set forth together with the      other advantages which are obvious and which are inherent in the      structure. </PAR><PAR>  It will be understood that certain features and subcombinations are of      utility and may be employed without reference to other features and      subcombinations. This is contemplated by and is within the scope of the      claims. </PAR><PAR>  Since many possible embodiments may be made of the invention without      departing from the scope thereof, it is to be understood that all matter      herein set forth or shown in the accompanying drawings is to be      interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
