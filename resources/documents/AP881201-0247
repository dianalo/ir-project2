Nolan, noting that familieshave been reunited through the letters and one person received aneye operation. ``Every year, we kind of have a miracle on 34thStreet here.'' New York's main post office is a massiveneo-classical building on Eighth Avenue with its north side on 34thStreet.   The post office kicked off this year's campaign Wednesday,although 4,000 of an expected 18,000 letters to Santa from the lessfortunate around the world have already been received.   Last year, more than 16,000 letters to Santa from about 10countries, many addressed to the North Pole and bearing a New Yorkzip code, ended up at the main post office's dead letter unit. GoodSamaritans answered about 14,000 of them, Nolan said.   New York postal employees, with the public's help, have beengranting Christmas wishes for 60 years.   ``I don't believe in you, but my teacher says I have to write youa letter anyway,'' confessed Mark, who lives in a Manhattan welfarehotel. ``For Christmas, could you please bring my mother a coat? ...My teacher gave her one, but it didn't fit.''   ``My husband is a junkie and he left us with nothing,'' wrote amother of three in Brooklyn. ``So I left him and moved in with mymom and dad. It's embarrassing enough that I can't afford to get mykids anything.''   ``I budget for one meal a day,'' said a Bronx woman who israising three children and a grandchild on a salary of $2.35 anhour. ``It drives me crazy sometimes and I feel like the world wantsto come down.''   ``We don't vouch for the exact accuracy or need,'' said Nolan,but he feels most of the letters are legitimate.   About 25 grade-school children, many of them welfare hotelresidents, chatted with Santa during a news conference to launch thevolunteer drive.   Ellen Hernandez, 9, said she wanted ``a baby girl'' forChristmas. ``Santa doesn't give baby girls. We can give you a babydoll, though,'' he replied jovially.   ``Lose some weight,'' advised Tiffany Rodriguez, 8, but St. Nicksaid he couldn't make such a promise.   Volunteers can get letters to answer by calling, writing or goingto the main post office.   The 1947 film ``Miracle on 34th Street'' tells the story of alawyer who proves the existence of Santa Claus using as evidence thebags and bags of letters the U.S. Postal Service delivered to him.The Santa in question worked at Macy's department store, which alsois on 34th Street in Manhattan.</TEXT></DOC>
