Title II, Part Bof Pub. L. 100-297 revises the Adult Education Act (the Act), which waspreviously set forth in 20 U.S.C. 1201 <T3>et seq. </T3>The revised Act continues Federal assistance for adulteducation through fiscal year 1993. The primary effect of the Act is the continuance of the Adult EducationState-administered Basic Grant Program. Under the revised Act States arenow required to develop a systematic approach for meeting the needs ofpopulations eligible for adult education programs. States must also expandthe delivery of adult education services to reach typically underservedgroups and involve a variety of public and private agencies and organizationsthat serve educationally disadvantaged adults in the development and implementationof the State's programs. The Act heightens the focus of programs on ``educationally disadvantagedadults''_defined by the Act generally as adults who demonstrate basic skillsat or below the fifth grade level or have been placed in the lowest orbeginning level of an adult education program. Special emphasis is alsogiven to such adult populations as the incarcerated, individuals of limitedEnglish proficiency, adults with handicaps, adult immigrants, the chronicallyunemployed, homeless adults, migrant farmworkers, the institutionalized,and minorities. The Act also encourages long-range coordinated planning,and increases requirements related to coordination with other programsand public and community involvement. Beginning with the grant from thefiscal year 1990 appropriation, States must pay an increasing share ofthe cost of programs. In addition to the basic State grant program, the Act authorizes severalnew categorical programs_some to be administered at the national level,others to be administered by the States. Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act Title VI, Part A, Subpart 1 of Pub. L. 100-297 and Title VII, SubtitleA, section 701 of Pub. L. 100-628 amend section 702 of the McKinney Act,which authorizes the Adult Education for the Homeless Program. The amendmentsto section 702_ (1) Provide that State applications include ``an estimate of the numberof homeless adults expected to be served and the number of homeless adultswithin each of the school districts within the State to be served''; (2) Remove the State grant allocation formula; (3) Provide authority for a discretionary program; (4) Permit a State to implement the program either directly or throughcontracts or subgrants; and(5) Expand the definition of State to include the Virgin Islands, Guam,American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Major Provisions </ITAG>(1) <T3>Terms. </T3>The Act uses interchangeably the terms ``individuals oflimited English proficiency,'' ``persons with limited English proficiency,''``limited English proficient adults,'' and ``adults with limited Englishproficiency.'' The Act also defines ``individuals of limited English proficiency''(section 312(11)) and cross-references a definition of ``limited Englishproficiency'' and ``limited English proficient'' when used with referenceto individuals. The latter definition is found in section 7003(a)(1) ofPub. L. 100-297. For the sake of clarity, the regulations provide one definitionfor all of the terms that refer to persons of limited English proficiency.This is the definition in section 7003(a)(1). This definition includesat least all of the individuals covered in the definition in section 312(11)as well as other populations. (2) <T3>Adult Education State-administered Basic Grant Program_</T3>(a) <T3>State requirements. </T3>Section 426.3 requires each State that participatesin the Adult Education State-administered Basic Grant Program to designatethe State educational agency (SEA) as the sole State agency responsiblefor the administration and supervision of its State program, and to assignqualified State personnel to carry out the SEA's responsibilities underthe State plan. In formulating the State plan, the SEA must meet with and utilize the Stateadvisory council, if the State has chosen to establish a council, conductat least two public hearings regarding the development of the State plan;make a thorough assessment of the needs of adults to be served and thoseserved and of the capability of existing programs and institutions to meetthose needs; and state the changes and improvements required in adult educationto fulfill the purposes of the Act and the options for implementing thosechanges and improvements (andSection; 426.11). The State application and plan must contain a variety of new assurancesand descriptions. For example, these include the new assurance that fundswill be used for programs, services, and activities that are designed toexpand or improve the quality of adult education, to initiate new programsof high quality, or, where necessary, to maintain programs (andSection; 426.10(b)(3)).Further, each State must assure that information will be reported aboutthe State's adult education students, programs, expenditures, and goals,as may be required by the Secretary. Although not explicitly enumerated,these data may include, but are not limited to, information with respectto the age, sex, and race of students in programs assisted under the Actand whether the students complete the programs (andSection; 426.10(b)(10)).The new required descriptions include, for example, a description of theneeds of all segments of the adult population, particularly the needs ofadults who are educationally disadvantaged (andSection; 426.12(a)(1)); adescription of the manner in which the needs of adults of limited Englishproficiency or no English proficiency will be met through programs designedto teach English and, as appropriate, to allow those adults to progresseffectively through the adult education program or to prepare them to enterthe regular program of adult education as quickly as possible (andSection;426.12(a)(8)); a description of how the special educational needs of adultimmigrants, the incarcerated, adults with handicaps, the chronically unemployed,homeless adults, migrant farmworkers, the disadvantaged, and minoritiesin the State will be addressed (andSection; 426.12(a)(9)); and a descriptionof the methods proposed for joint planning and coordination with programsconducted under a variety of State and Federal programs (andSection; 426.12(a)(13)).The regulations clarify the statute by requiring that the descriptionsof activities to be carried out under the State plan must also includea description of the policies, procedures, and activities for carryingout special experimental demonstration projects and teacher training projectsand corrections education and education for other institutionalized adults(andSection; 426.12(a)(16) and (17), respectively). The regulations alsorequire that State plans include the States' planned use of Federal fundsfor administrative costs, including planned expenditures for State advisorycouncils (andSection; 426.12(a)(18)). The SEA must submit its State plan and application to the Secretary notlater than 90 days prior to the first program year for which the plan isin effect (andSection; 426.13(a)). At least sixty days before submittingthe State plan to the Secretary, the SEA must submit its plan to the Stateadvisory council, if the State has chosen to establish a council, the Stateboard or agency for vocational education, the State Job Training CoordinatingCouncil under the Job Training Partnership Act, and the State board oragency for postsecondary education (andSection; 426.13(b) and (c)). The provisions in section 435 of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA)dealing with the general State application do not apply to State-administeredadult education programs by virtue of section 341(c) of the Act.(b) <T3>Eligible recipients. </T3>Local educational agencies (LEAs) and otherpublic or private agencies, organizations, or institutions that meet certainconditions continue to be eligible to receive awards from SEAs. A consortiumthat includes a for-profit agency, organization, or institution is nowalso eligible if the for-profit entity has entered into a contract withan LEA or other nonprofit entity and the for-profit entity can make a significantcontribution toward attaining the objectives of the Act (andSection;andSection;426.30 and 426.31(g)). (c) <T3>Local application requirements. </T3>Section 322(a)(3) of the Act establisheslocal application requirements (andSection; 426.31(c)). In order to strengthenthe link between local applications and the State plan, and to ensure accountability,the regulations include additional information the State may consider whenreviewing local applications (andSection; 426.31(d)). (d) <T3>Program reviews and evaluations. </T3>These regulations describe theprogram reviews and evaluations States are required to perform (andSection;426.46), and the criteria the Secretary considers in approving a State'splan to carry out these activities (andSection; 426.22). Section 426.46(d)(1)(ii)requires States to report, within 90 days of the close of each programyear, on the program review and evaluation activities it has conductedduring that year. However, this requirement does not mean that States mustrestrict their program reviews and evaluations to a period of only 90 daysafter the close of a particular project. (e) <T3>State advisory councils. </T3>States are not required to establishState advisory councils. However, if a council is established, there areseveral new provisions governing their operation (andSection;andSection; 426.50through 426.52). For example, the Governor _ rather than the SEA _ determinesthe level of funding for the council (andSection; 426.50(b)(4)). The costsof State councils are considered as State administrative costs (andSection;426.50(b)(3)). (f) <T3>Fiscal requirements. </T3>An SEA must expend not less than 10 percentof its grant for corrections education and education for other institutionalizedadults (andSection; 426.33). For grants awarded on or after June 30, 1991, an SEA may use no more than5 percent of its grant or $50,000, whichever is greater, to pay the costsfor State administration of the Program (andSection; 426.40(a)). An eligible recipient may expend no more than 5 percent of its award forlocal administrative costs, except that necessary and reasonable costsin excess of the 5 percent limitation may be negotiated between an SEAand eligible recipient (andSection; 426.40(b)). While section 361(b) of the Act apparently refers to the Federal fiscalyear (October 1 through September 30) as a basis for maintenance of effortcomputations, by long standing practice States carry out their adult educationprograms on the basis of program years running from July 1 through June30. The regulations, therefore, provide States the flexibility to performmaintenance of effort computations on either a Federal fiscal year or programyear basis. However, once a State chooses the basis for its maintenanceof effort computations, that basis must be used consistently. (3) <T3>National Workplace Literacy Program. </T3>The National Workplace LiteracyProgram provides direct grants for demonstration projects that teach literacyskills needed in the workplace through education partnerships between business,industry, or labor organizations and educational organizations (andSection;432.1). The regulations establish eligibility requirements (andSection; 432.2),program priorities (andSection; 432.20), and selection criteria for evaluatingapplications (andSection; 432.22). In general, Federal funds are to be usedto pay 70 percent of the costs of projects (andSection; 432.30). (4) <T3>State-administered Workplace Literacy Program. </T3>If the appropriationfor the Workplace Literacy Program is $50,000,000 or greater, the Secretarymakes grants to SEAs _ rather than making grants directly to partnerships.The SEAs in turn make awards to partnerships (andSection;andSection; 433.1and 433.30). The Secretary determines the amount of each State's allotmentaccording to the formula in section 371(b)(7)(B) of the Act (andSection;433.20). Section 433.21 implements a statutory provision under which Statesmay not obligate after the end of a fiscal year any amount in excess of10 percent of the amount allotted to the State for that fiscal year. TheSecretary reallocates unobligated excess amounts to other States that didnot have unobligated funds in excess of 10 percent. The Secretary is particularlyinterested in receiving comments about the implementation of this provision.(5) <T3>State-administered English Literacy Program. </T3>Under this program,grants are provided to States for the establishment, operation, and improvementof English Literacy programs of instruction that are designed to help limitedEnglish proficient adults, out-of-school youths, or both, achieve fullcompetence in the English language (andSection; 434.3). To receive an awardunder this program, an SEA must have included in its State plan the descriptionsrequired under section 372(a)(2) of the Act (andSection;andSection; 434.2 and434.10). These regulations establish a formula for determining the amountof each State's allotment (andSection; 434.20). The regulations also describethe eligible recipients, percentage requirements, and other conditionsto be met after a State receives an award (andSection;andSection; 434.30 through434.33). (6) <T3>National English Literacy Demonstration Program for Individuals ofLimited English Proficiency. </T3>This discretionary program provides grantsand contracts for the development of innovative approaches and methodsof English literacy education for individuals of limited English proficiency(andSection; 435.3). The regulations describe eligible applicants and establishselection criteria for evaluating applications (andSection;andSection; 435.2and 435.21, respectively). (7) <T3>Adult Migrant Farmworker and Immigrant Education Program. </T3>Thisdiscretionary program provides direct grants for planning, developing,and evaluating projects that are designed to provide adult education programs,services, and activities to meet the special needs of adult migrant farmworkersand immigrants (andSection; 436.2). The regulations describe eligible applicants,program priorities, and criteria for evaluating applications (andSection;andSection;436.3, 436.20, and 436.22, respectively). Eligible applicants, includingSEAs, must provide direct services since there is no subgrant authorityunder this program (andSection; 436.3). (8) <T3>National Adult Literacy Volunteer Training Program. </T3>This discretionaryprogram provides direct grants for planning, implementing, and evaluatingprojects designed to train adult volunteers, especially the elderly, whowish to participate as tutors in local adult education programs under theAct (andSection; 437.3). The regulations describe the eligible applicantsand selection criteria for evaluating applications (andSection;andSection;437.2 and 437.21, respectively). Eligible applicants, including SEAs, mustprovide direct services since there is no subgrant authority under thisprogram (andSection; 437.2). (9) <T3>State Program Analysis Assistance and Policy Studies Program. </T3>Thisdiscretionary program authorizes activities to assist States in evaluatingthe status and progress of adult education in achieving the purposes ofthe Act (andSection; 438.1). The regulations provide for the program to beadministered directly or through grants or contracts (andSection;andSection;438.2 and 438.3). The regulations also describe the type of activitiesto be funded (andSection; 438.3) and the criteria for evaluating applications(andSection; 438.21). (10) <T3>Adult Education for the Homeless Program. </T3>This program_authorizedby section 702 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act_providesfinancial assistance to enable State educational agencies to implementa program of literacy training and basic skills remediation for adult homelessindividuals within their State (andSection; 441.1). The Adult Education forthe Homeless Program is currently a formula grant program. However, asa result of the amendments in Pub. L. 100-297, the program will be administeredas a national discretionary program in order to maximize the impact ofthe small amount of funds available specifically for educating homelessadults. The regulations also define terms (andSection; 441.5), establishcriteria for evaluating applications (andSection; 441.21), describe conditionsto be met after a State receives an award (andSection;andSection; 441.30 and441.31), and provide that a State may implement its program either directlyor through contracts or subgrants (andSection; 441.1). <ITAG tagnum="84">Applicable Regulations </ITAG>The provisions in these proposed regulations that cite other applicableregulations, andSection;andSection; 425.3 and 441.4, do not include the usualreference to 34 CFR Part 78 (Hearing Procedures for the Education AppealBoard), because the Education Appeal Board has been succeeded, as of October25, 1988, by a new Office of Administrative Law Judges. In Pub. L. 100-297,Congress amended Part E of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA),effective October 25, 1988, requiring the Secretary to establish an Officeof Administrative Law Judges to replace the Education Appeal Board, andestablishing new hearing procedures (20 U.S.C. 1234-1234i). The Departmentpublished proposed regulations implementing the amended Part E of GEPAon December 2, 1988, 53 FR 48866, and those regulations, when final, willapply to the adult education programs. Sections 425.3 and 441.4 of theseregulations will then be amended to include references to the revised regulationsunder Part E. Executive Order 12291 These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meetthe criteria for major regulations established in the order. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.Under the State-administered adult education programs, grants are availableonly to States, and States and State agencies are not defined as ``smallentities'' in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. To the extent that theseregulations have an impact on small entities, they repeat statutory requirements.The selection criteria for applications reviewed under the Secretary'sdiscretionary programs require the minimum amount of information necessaryfor a fair appraisal of the activities proposed by applicants in orderto ensure the funding of high quality projects. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 </ITAG>Sections 426.10, 426.12, 426.13, 426.14, 426.22, 426.31, 426.44, 426.46,426.51, 426.52, 432.22, 433.10, 433.32, 433.51, 434.10, 434.34, 435.21,436.22, 437.21, 438.21, and 441.21 contain information collection requirements.As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Educationwill submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) for review. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the informationcollection requirements should direct them to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,DC 20503, Attention: James D.
