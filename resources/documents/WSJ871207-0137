Odyssey said its latest offer, which isn't subject to financing arrangements, would be withdrawn &quot;if significant progress has not been made within 10 days.&quot; Odyssey also said Heritage agreed to meet to discuss the offer.    A Heritage spokesman, however, said only that its board &quot;is going to review it in its normal course.&quot;    The new offer consists of $1 and one-fifth of a share of Odyssey's $25 par value convertible preferred with a 7.5% annual dividend for each Heritage share outstanding. One Odyssey preferred share is convertible into 50 shares of Odyssey common, the company said.    Heritage, a movie and television production and distribution concern, has about 5.1 million common shares outstanding, of which 9.8% are owned by Odyssey. Odyssey has about 105.5 million common shares outstanding.    In October, Odyssey withdrew its earlier offer to acquire Heritage, terms of which weren't disclosed. </TEXT></DOC>
