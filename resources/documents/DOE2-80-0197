As concerns operating parameters the studyinvestigated average annual power output over the operating period, unitefficiency, share of own power consumption of the overall power productionand the number of operating hours during which at least one turbogeneratorwas in operation. Of the reliability parameters the coefficient of availabilityof installed capacity is presented as the ratio of actually generatedpower and the amount which could have been generated with regard to therated capacity during the whole season, and the coefficient of technicalavailability as the ratio of the operating period to the total calendaryear. It is stated that WWER-440 units both in Czechoslovakia and inother countries show good reliability parameters as compared with nuclearpower plants with coresponding reactors of other types elsewhere.
