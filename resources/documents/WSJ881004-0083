Individuals familiar with the talks said the arrangements could be disclosed as early as today. Although the nature of the agreement couldn't be established, it's known that Texas Air has discussed a wide range of possibilities, including feeder-flight arrangements, the sale of landing rights to SAS and even the sale of an equity interest in Texas Air, the Houston-based parent of Continental and Eastern Airlines.    In any event, one of the individuals said, the arrangements are &quot;totally unique.&quot;    Although the companies have extensively discussed numerous joint-marketing plans, the agreement won't involve the sale of an interest in Texas Air's System One Holdings unit, one of the nation's leading computer-reservations systems. But that doesn't preclude a joint-marketing arrangement in which SAS would be able to use the reservation system.    The possible outcomes of the talks also include establishing joint facilities at Eastern's terminal at Kennedy Airport in New York and Continental's terminal at Newark, N.J., and developing joint-training programs and combining offices in cities around the world. Local press reports in Stockholm suggest the accord with Texas Air will bring SAS landing rights it has hotly pursued for at least two U.S. cities it doesn't already serve -- probably including Miami.    SAS, which is half-owned by Denmark, Norway and Sweden, has been taking an aggressive strategy as it faces progressive deregulation of the European airline industry beginning in 1992. Anticipating the kind of stiff competition that has buffeted U.S. airlines after deregulation, SAS has tried to strengthen itself by courting several of the world's leading airlines with various offers.    SAS worries that deregulation ultimately will leave only five or six major carriers in Europe. &quot;We can't expand in free competition in Europe,&quot; a spokesman said.    Talks fizzled with Belgium's national carrier, Sabena, and Finland's Finnair two years ago. Last year, SAS lost a takeover battle that would have given it a big stake in British Caledonian Airways. And this summer, a SAS bid for a $40 million stake in Argentina's soon-to-be-privatized Aerolinas Argentinas was derailed because of political opposition in Argentina.    Until Jan Carlzon's arrival as president in 1981, SAS was dull, undistinguished from other European airlines protected by monopoly privileges and high fares.    Mr. Carlzon jazzed up marketing, concentrating on high-margin business passengers who pay full fares. SAS profit surged along with the mounting share of full-fare paying passengers. Though a medium-sized airline by European standards, with about a 10% share of overall European air revenue, SAS accounted for almost 40% of European air carriers' collective pretax profits in 1986.    Texas Air, by contrast, has accumulated stunning losses for more than a year, due partly to the huge debt levels at Eastern and Continental as well as to relatively high operating costs at Eastern. On a consolidated basis, Texas Air has more than $5 billion in debt.    Although Eastern and Continental lately have been shrinking operations, Continental is intent on expanding its service overseas. Recently, it won federal approval to begin highly lucrative service between Seattle and Tokyo, for instance. </TEXT></DOC>
