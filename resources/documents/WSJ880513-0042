There's &quot;a good possibility that financial services could contribute up to 30%&quot; of Ford's earnings eventually, Vice Chairman Harold A. Poling said at a news conference after the company's annual meeting. Financial services provided 18% of Ford's net income of $4.6 billion last year, and Ford has said it wants to expand its existing financial operations and possibly acquire new ones.    The company's existing financial operations include Ford Motor Credit Co., which finances purchases of Ford vehicles, First Nationwide Financial Corp., a thrift holding company, and U.S. Leasing International Inc., a commercial leasing concern. Ford executives declined to specify what kinds of financial services business they might buy, although it's understood they are wary of securities firms. Ford recently made an unsuccessful bid for Financial Corp. of America, a struggling thrift holding company.    Chairman Donald E. Petersen wouldn't say just how much Ford will spend on its core automotive operations in the next five years, but said it will easily top the $16.6 billion invested in the past five years.    The money &quot;will go for the development of new products as well as the application of new production processes and tooling,&quot; Mr. Petersen said. While he wasn't more specific, Ford officials have said a prime target is to develop new engines that combine more power with more efficiency-an area in which Ford trails both Japanese auto makers and General Motors Corp.-and new transmissions as well.    Mr. Petersen said Ford's likeliest area for a major diversification beyond financial services and aerospace operations remains &quot;the rather general area of electronics.&quot; But he wouldn't specify what part of that industry most interests Ford, and said the company won't set a deadline for making an acquisition.    Ford is continuing its negotiations for trade with the Soviet Union, other Eastern Bloc nations and possibly China. We &quot;see the Eastern European countries as a very logical area in which to try to develop more business,&quot; Mr. Petersen said. &quot;There's a chronic shortage of transportation in those economies and sooner or later there's bound to be some growth in the auto sector.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
