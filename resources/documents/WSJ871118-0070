Caird andamp; Sons PLC.    The DTI didn't give any further details about the investigation. Sources indicated the DTI initiated the inquiry based on information supplied by the stock exchange. Stock exchange officials declined to comment on the case.    Mr. Linacre was a former London employee of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. A spokesman at Merrill Lynch said the firm dismissed Mr. Linacre around the end of 1986 for violating its rules on share dealing and reported the matter to the stock exchange. He declined to elaborate.    At the time, Mr. Linacre was a U.K. equity salesman for Merrill, the spokesman said. The firm arranged a vendor placing of shares for Grand Central last year, he added.    Mr. Linacre couldn't be reached for comment. An official at Caird, a property investment company, said Mr. Linacre didn't intend to resign his post and that the company's board would meet on the matter today. </TEXT></DOC>
