A two-dimensional magnetic ridge, similarto that observed for La{sub 2}CuO/sub 4-//sub y/, has been clearly identifiedby triple-axis measurements. The slope of the dispersion curve for spin-waveexcitations is very large (approx. andgt;0.5 eV A), consistent with the resultof spin-pair Raman scattering by Lyons et al.</TEXT></DOC>
