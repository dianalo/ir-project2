Dean Meyer and Associates isa brain-storming package for information systems managers who useexpert-systems technology.andP;  FamilyCare Software, a Lundin Laboratories Inc.andO;system, provides pediatric advice.andP;  Personnel Policy Expert fromKnowledgePoint helps generate personnel policies for companies.andP;  CriterionSoftware Inc.'s STS/Expert acts like a stock expert from a technical tradingviewpoint.andP;  The list goes on.andM;Mass-market expert-system applications generally run on micro-computers, costless than $500, and have a limited range of expert performance.andP;  However,expert-system technology usually enhances a product's usability anddifferentiates it in the public's mind.andP;  We are in only the first stages ofmerging expert systems with mass-market applications; there's room for newcross-fertilizations and improvement in the trials already on the street.andM;As mass-market expert-system applications become more widespread, awarenessabout the expert-system industry will increase.andP;  If the results are positive,the industry will be perceived as having valuable techniques and tools thatcan make software safer and stronger.andP;  If the results are negative, we maysee product liability suits that will frighten even the largest developers.andO;Right now, mass-market expert-system applications are a cottage industry,developed and championed by entrepreneurs escaping from the frustrating,day-to-day work of traditional software development.andM;A mass-market application can be either a service or product, and eitherembedded or freestanding.andP;  (Imagine a 2X2 matrix with service or product onone axis and freestanding or embedded on the other.)andP;  A product is sold tothe purchaser who uses it as often as desired; a service is a temporary useof the application where the package remains under the control of theprovider, and the purchaser pays a fee for its use.andP;  A freestandingapplication is one where the expert-system portion constitutes the bulk ofthe application and the program does not significantly rely on other softwarepackages for assistance.andP;  An embedded application resides within some otherset of applications and provides assistance when invoked.andM;For example, FamilyCare is a freestanding product--you buy the software, itworks directly with the used and needs no other components.andP;  BookmanConsulting's Teck-Chek, an expert-system program that analyzes programmersfor their COBOL-writing abilities, is available only as a freestandingservice (programmers take the test administered and scored by TeckChek).andP;  Anexample of an embedded product and service is ATRANS from Cognitive SystemsInc., which processes money-transfer messages.andP;  In some cases, an applicationcan be available as a product and service, or available on a freestanding andembedded basis.andM;Most mass-market expert-system applications have been provided asfreestanding products and developed specifically for mass-market sales.andP;  ButI've seen some companies provide an in-house expert system to other parts ofthe organization as a freestanding service, which is eventually combined withother applications in the organization to become an embedded service, and isthen converted into a product for resale outside the firm on a stand-alonebasis.andM;One of the major difficulties with mass-market expert-system applications isdetermining just where the expert system's role begins and ends.andP;  Is anapplication using expert-systems technology if it has rules?andP;  Is it necessaryfor the application to be developed in a shell to be an &quot;expert-system user&quot;?andO;At this stage the boundaries are vague, but the right to claim that anapplication has the right stuff is debatable.andM;Many firms in the applications arena have tried to ride the AI bandwagonwithout much regard for the use of AI in their packages.andP;  FormAtionsTechnologies Inc. claimed that its Loan Calc II &quot;automated loan originationsystem is the most flexible product on the market today...and its artificialintelligence actually anticipates what the user wants to do.&quot;andP;  When Icontacted the firm, they admitted that the program just allows the user toactivate a kind of watchme mode (tracking the path a user navigates throughthe package's menus), which then detects the same path upon its initiationand can complete the menu moving sequence.andP;  Most AIers would agree that this&quot;special&quot; navigation feature is only token AI.andM;Some firms have been more cautious in their touting of AI.andP;  The CommercialLoan System from Automated Design Systems Inc. notes that &quot;ADS hasincorporated 'expert system technology' into the system that provides theuser with a rules base and knowledge base that builds operating procedures totake the loan from the beginning of the application through closing and thento the ongoing tasks that are required to service the loan.&quot;andP;  Notice thequotemarks around expert system--a cautious move reinforcing the idea that AIadvisory capabilities do not necessarily add up to full expert performance.andO;(And acknowledging that no one is sure just what constitutes the coundariesof expert-system technology.)andM;You might quibble with the ADS claim when in divides the expert systemportion into rule and knowledge bases (many AIers would refer to them as oneitem), but they later clarify the differences with their view of expertsystems: &quot;The rule base provides for specialized procedures...that drive theuser through the lending process.andP;  The knowledge base is a 'default database'that stores information for each loan type....&quot;andP;  The separation of theprocessing and data portions goes against the amalgamation a knowledge baseis supposed to provide, yet I suspect that the average buyer of theCommercial Loan System would find the explanation much simpler to understandand raise less concern over how it works (since it sounds nearly as risk-freeas normal programs, but somehow cleverly sweetened).andM;Overall, we should not be too surprised that the AI bandwagon still exists.andO;It's similar to the usual computer industry one that rolls in whenever a newtechnology does.andP;  For example, we've had the fairly recent relational DBMSbandwagon (products claim either the direct use of one or performance likeone) and the early history on-screen menu bandwagon.andP;  (Remember wheninter-active software was predominantly command-based, and menu lists werepopularized specially by spreadsheets?)andM;It's dangerous for a subfield of computer technology to permit excessivebandwagon riding; the so-called AI winter is a prime example of hypedexpectations that boomeranged.andP;  Hype may help a product in the short-term,assuming the hype isn't immediately exposed, but in the long-term it can killthe product and smear everyone else.andP;  Mass-market expert-system developerswould be wise to differentiate their product by stressing the expert-systemor advisory features, but would do so with care.andM;Most of the mainstream mass-market expert-systems applications have beendeveloped by ery small firms or single individuals.andP;  The field remains wideopen for entrepreneurs working out of their garages.andP;  AskDan was pretty muchthe result of Dan Caine's work, just a GamePlan was Dean Meyer's.andO;Ultimately, a successful product tends to bring good and bad news.andP;  After theapplication attracts attention, it becomes too difficult for one person tomanage (one person can't keep up with the support requests, changes to theproduct, handling media requests, and so on).andP;  Many of the developers broadentheir organization, hiring more employees or outside services to ensurecontinued success.andM;I predict that this cottage-industry approach will last for some time.andO;Binding expert systems with traditional applications requires an innovationusually found in small outfits or expressed by small organizations.andP;  (Largeorganizations may have pockets of innovation, but the innovations are usuallyburied or lost among the larger bureaucratic inertia.)andP;  In the near future,knowledge engineers with isolated interests will team with domain specialistsoccasionally to produce these mass-market applications.andM;For example, Randy Farrar is a TRW software developer who decided to take hisinterest in gardening to its logical AI conclusion.andP;  His programRootDirectory from GardenTech is a small-scale expert system that replacesthe do-it-yourself gardening book.andP;  You can figure out what to do with thatdying tree in your front yard or decide where to plant your petunias.andP;  Farrarhad hoped to become a farmer after getting his bachelor's degree inagricultural business but discovered that the farming life is a difficultone.andP;  By spending his nights and week-ends developing RootDirectory, he hasretained his interest in agriculture and has a day job that pays the bills toboot.andM;I regularly meet knowledge engineers holding degrees having little relevanceto computer science (marine biology, accounting, agriculture, politicscience), though they may have practiced data processing for many years.andP;  Iencourage then (and you readers) to resurrect love for that first area ofstudy--perhaps the domain needs a good expert system or two!andP;  But don't justjump in: a business plan (which can be fairly informal) should be prepared,and you should legally protect yourself.andP;  (Your employer may claim partialownership of your application and attempt to take your profits.)andM;As more applications emerge from the cottage industry, we'll see increasedinterest from established firms.andP;  Already Business Week advertises theirpseudo-expert-system package called Business Advantage.andP;  The program usesBusiness Week case studies and allows readers to simulate the situationsportrayed in the case (a variation on management-gaming simulation programsthat have been around for years).andP;  Money Magazine touts Wealthbuilder, afinancial planning expert-system-like program that helps with personalinvestment decisions.andP;  Companies offering manual, text-based knowledge have anatural link with the advent of mass-market expert-system applications(automated, text-focused knowledge).andP;  You might consider cooperating with anestablished firm to develop such applications, instead of developing itoutright and then finding a larger partner to help refine and sell it.andM;Be warned that approaching people with an idea to expert-systematize theirapproaches may meet some resistance.andP;  Just as the electric toothbrush metwith severe doubts from manual toothbrush makers, you too will findskepticism from most hardened domain specialists.andP;  By &quot;hardened&quot; I don't meantheir brains have solidified, though in many respects their perceptions ofthe domain are usually quite rigid--supporting the &quot;we don't want what isn'tinvented here&quot; mentality.andM;If worse comes to worst, you can sneak your way into the industry and hopethat the dogmatics will see the wisdom of your way.andP;  Personal Pro fromComputer Sports is an expert system written in VP-Expert that diagnoses auser's golf swing based on descriptions of their golf prowess.andP;  The makers ofPersonal Pro have tied in their package with an interactive golf-trainingdevice made by Sports Technology Inc. and endorsed by the PGA Tour.andP;  A usercan collect information from the separate golf-training device and enter itinto Personal Pro for additional diagnosis.andP;  Thus, users of one accepteddomain application (the Sports Technology Inc. device) may make the logicalconnection to your new application (Personal Pro), whether the establishedmarket participants accept it or not.andM;Suppose you aren't a singer, and don't have any other hobbies or intereststhat lend themselves to exploiting your expert-system building talents.andP;  Whatcan you do?andP;  Besides teaming up with some other domain specialist, which canbe tough (you need to find someone with the right chemistry, you'll need apartnership agreement, you'll both need to have the time available, and soon), you might consider taking a domain you already know well--namely,computer programming--and develop an expert-system application for it.andM;Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) has become the latest computerindustry bandwagon, so why not ride it?andP;  If what you know best is softwaredevelopment, then think about ways an expert-system application could helpother programmers work faster, easier, and smarter.andP;  You're not the first onyour block--at least two CASE vendors have already established a presence byusing expert-system technology.andP;  Visible Analyst Workbench from VisibleSystems Corp. uses an expert system for consistency checking of data-flowdiagrams, CASEWorks Inc.'s CASE:W uses an expert system to generate C codefor Windows applications.andM;The fact that some vendors are already using the expert systems in CASE toolsis a blessing in disguise for readers thinking about pursuing thismass-market expert-system angle.andP;  First, these CASE vendors have set aprecedent and thereby reduce the &quot;say what?&quot; factor (resistance fromprogrammers wondering why or how an expert system could be used inprogramming).andP;  Second, they've staked out very tiny aspects of softwareengineering and have left gaping holes for additional expert-systemapplications (so there's room for more!).andP;  Third, you can discover how to doand not do your own CASE-related application by looking at what they've done(play with their package, read published reviews, and ask your programmingfriends to try them too).andM;Mass-market expert-system applications are the future of expert systems, andgood luck if you decide to embark on your own application odyssey.andP;  I trustyou'll send me a royalty check when your application makes it to the top-10softwar seller list of 1992.andM;Lance B.
