U.N. figures show the 159 member nations owe the world body$979.1 million dollars in unpaid regular dues and peacekeepingassessments, with the United States being the chief deadbeat.   On Friday, when U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellaraccepted the Nobel Prize award money in Oslo, Norway, on behalf ofthe more than half-million peacekeepers who have served the UnitedNations, he observed:   ``In some ways it's embarrassing because it forces me to saypublicly that the United States still owes the United Nations almost$350 million.''   U.N. member nations owe the world body $450.1 million in regulardues; $360.1 million in dues for the Lebanon, Middle East andIran-Iraq peacekeeping forces; and $168.9 million in unpaidcontributions to the Cyprus peacekeeping force.   The Cyprus force is supposed to be financed through voluntarycontributions the United Nations uses to reimburse the participatingnations _ Australia, Austria, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland,Ireland and Sweden.   President Reagan said in September that the United States wouldgradually repay all its dues. It has withheld money in recent yearsto protest what the Reagan administration saw as mismanagement,overstaffing, and an anti-Western bias at the United Nations.   The Soviet Union owes $7.2 million in regular dues and $151.3million in peacekeeping dues, which it is repaying on a scheduleworked out with the United Nations.</TEXT></DOC>
