DeBartolo Corp. may haveviolated federal securities laws related to corporate takeoverbids, according to documents released Friday.   The Securities and Exchange Commission said it has informationsuggesting that Paul A. Bilzerian, chairman of Singer Co., may haveentered into illegal arrangements with certain broker-dealers topurchase stock in Carter Hawley Hale Stores, Cluett Peabody andamp; Co.,Hammermill Paper Co. and other publicly owned companies.   The SEC also said documents suggest that Edward J. Bartolo Sr.,head of Youngstown, Ohio-based DeBartolo Corp., may have enteredinto undisclosed arrangements with Bilzerian with regard to theacquisition of Cluett and Hammermill securities.   ``These documents suggest that, among other things, DeBartoloSr. may have loaned millions of dollars to Bilzerian, to employeesof EJDC (DeBartolo Corp.) and to relatives of DeBartolo Sr. to beused by them to purchase Hammermill and Cluett securities,'' theSEC said.   The agency also said the documents suggest that Bilzerian andDeBartolo Sr. may have entered into an undisclosed profit-sharingarrangement regarding Cluett securities.   Bilzerian launched unsuccessful takeover bids for Cluett Peabodyin 1985 and Hammermill in 1986 and made millions in stock profitsand reimbursed expenses when he was outbid.   A spokeswoman for DeBartolo Corp. referred calls to StephenFlood, DeBartolo's attorney. Several calls to Flood went unreturned.   ``We have no comment,'' said Ted Levine, a partner at Wilmer,Cutler andamp; Pickering, a law firm representing Bilzerian.   The SEC's assertions were contained in documents filed in U.S.District Court last month as part of a bid to compel the seniorDeBartolo, Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. and other DeBartolo Corp.officers to comply with subpoenas seeking brokerage accountinformation and records of contacts with Bilzerian.   Federal law requires investors to disclose holdings in atakeover target within 10 days of the time they exceed 5 percent ofthe target company's shares. It also requires the disclosure ofanyone else acting in concert with the investor.   Disclosure of a 5 percent stake alerts the investment communityand often sends a stock price up in anticipation of a high-pricedtakeover bid.   Bilzerian did not disclose any loans from or arrangements withDeBartolo Sr. in his filings with the SEC on stock holdings inCluett or Hammermill, the agency said.   The SEC investigation is part of a wide-ranging probe ofso-called ``stock parking.''   Stock parking is an arrangement whereby one person sellssecurities to another with the understanding they will be held andlater sold back. The SEC said it is frequently used as a vehicle toconceal a beneficial ownership of securities and to evadedisclosure requirements.   Herbert Janick, an attorney in the SEC's division ofenforcement, said in a declaration filed with the court thatseveral documents on their face reflect that DeBartolo Sr.purchased Cluett and Hammermill securities in his own name andloaned funds to relatives, Bilzerian, and DeBartolo Corp. employeesto buy the securities.   Janick also said a page of handwritten notes suggests thatDeBartolo Sr. and Bilzerian entered into a profit-sharingarrangement concerning Cluett securities and indicates that the twomen discussed a purchasing strategy.   In addition to shopping centers and other real estate, DeBartoloowns the San Francisco 49ers football team and the PittsburghPenguins hockey team.</TEXT></DOC>
