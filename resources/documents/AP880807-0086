The radio report, monitored by British Broadcasting Corp., saidOil Minister Golamreza Agazadeh made the comment during a meetingwith a delegation of officials from Oman.   ``The achievement of a sincere unity in the decisions taken byOPEC requires great effort and cooperation by all the members,''Agazadeh was quoted as saying.   ``We are determined to play our role in achieving this goal,''he said.   Some OPEC leaders have expressed hope that a cease-fire in theIran-Iraq war could help boost oil prices.   During the war, Iran has been discounting its oil and Iraq hasbeen producing far more than under its last official OPEC outputquota. In addition, disagreement by the two war enemies over howlarge a quota the other should have has worsened attempts by thefractious cartel to reach consensus on how best to raise oil prices.   The theory is that if the war ends, Iran and Iraq will be moredisciplined.   The world oil cartel has been attempting to raise the averageprice of crude to $18 per 42-gallon barrel. Recently, world priceshave been at least $1 to $2 below that level.</TEXT></DOC>
