In this paper, some of the commonly used energyindicators are discussed. An application is described for the selectioningof school buildings in the Lombardy Region, in order to single out thehighest energy consuming buildings and establish priority among the proposedenergy saving actions. The most adequate indicator is: (Total ConsumedEnergy) X (Total Consumed Energy) /Floor Area. The choice of the geometricvariable as the denominator of the indicator seems to have a minor influenceon priorities, and therefore, it can be selected solely on the basisof ease of measurement.</TEXT></DOC>
