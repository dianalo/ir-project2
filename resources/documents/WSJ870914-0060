Young andamp; Rubicam was the nation's largest ad agency in 1986, according to Advertising Age, a trade publication, and has seen substantial growth, particularly in its New York office. World-wide billings in 1986 were $4.2 billion, and U.S. billings were $2.4 billion. The New York office accounts for more than half of U.S. billings, including $300 million in new business over the past two years, a spokesman said. Clients include Colgate-Palmolive Co., the U.S. Army and Eastman Kodak Co.    The new structure breaks the office into three groups, each reporting to a general manager and each having its own clients, creative and account executives, and media planners. The three general managers will report to Arthur Klein, 50 years old, who was named president and chief executive officer for New York; he had been executive vice president and managing director. As president, Mr. Klein succeeds John McGarry, who becomes chairman of the New York office, a new position, while remaining chairman of client services, responsible for client relations.    The moves are intended to &quot;eliminate some layers of decision making,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;Clients want things quicker.&quot; In a statement, Alexander Kroll, chairman and chief executive officer of the world-wide agency, said: &quot;As we grow larger, we must continue to grow swifter and smarter. . . . We will make ourselves smaller, where smaller is better.&quot; The New York office has 1,400 employees. World-wide, the agency has 10,000 employees.    The three new group general managers are Jane Brite, 43, who was an account director; John Glorieux, 40, who was an account director and director of client services; and George Guimaraes, 42, formerly director of business development. </TEXT></DOC>
