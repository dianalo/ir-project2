It is essential that each bone be examined in its entirety,including the cortex, medullary canal (cancellous bone or spongiosa),and articular ends. The position and alignment of joints are determined.In children, the epiphysis and epiphyseal line or physis must be observed.The adjacent soft tissues are examined. Obliteration of normal soft-tissuelines and the presence of a joint effusion are of particular importance.When disease is present, it is important to determine whether the processis limited to a single bone or joint or whether multiple bones or jointsare involved. The distribution of disease is also a consideration. Thepresence and type of bone destruction and bone production, the appearanceof the edges or borders of the lesion, and the presence or absence ofcortical expansion and periosteal reaction are also noted. The radiographicfindings are then correlated with the clinical history and the age andsex of the patient to arrive at a logical diagnosis. The diagnosis maybe firm in some instances; in other cases, a differential diagnosis isoffered since the exact diagnosis cannot be determined.</TEXT></DOC>
