David Banks, chairman of the Fort Smith, Ark.,nursing-home operator, said the sales are &quot;pretty good sizenumbers but, in perspective, a small part&quot; of the insiders'total holdings in Beverly Enterprises.</LP><TEXT>   The company executives were recently granted incentivestock options &quot;available to be sold over a five-year period,and {1991} was the first year they kicked in,&quot; he said.   The stock has traded between $4.75 and $12.375 in the past52 weeks, and closed yesterday at $11.375 in New York StockExchange trading. The insiders sold their shares at anaverage price of $10.73, SEC filings show.   The company is in a &quot;turnaround,&quot; said Mr. Banks, whodidn't himself sell stock. In the most recent quarter,Beverly Enterprises' income-per-share doubled to 10 cents ashare from five cents.   SEC filings show that roughly half of the shares sold weresold simultaneously with their purchase through the exerciseof options. But company executives said virtually all theshares sold were related to options exercises. Investors whotrack insider buying and selling normally give less weight tooption-related transactions. The reasoning is that insiderstreat stock purchased through options as compensation, not asan investment.   Schuyl Hollingsworth, the company's treasurer, sold 36,000shares in May, all related to the exercise of options, SECfilings show. He continues to hold about 12,000 shares andoptions to purchase an additional 33,000 shares, he said.   Mr. Hollingsworth said Beverly Enterprises insiders soldshares because the company has suspended cash bonuses for thepast three years, and they were treating the options as cashbonuses.   Moreover, the company relocated last year from Pasadenaand some executives were facing difficulties selling theirCalifornia homes, he said. The cash he raised from his salewill go toward purchasing a house in Arkansas, Mr.Hollingsworth said.   ---   COPPER-TOP INVESTORS: Eighteen insiders at DuracellInternational Inc. purchased the company's stock as part ofits May 2 initial public offering, SEC filings show. Intotal, the 18 insiders bought 576,050 shares for about $8.6million, according to the filings.   The stock of the Bethel, Conn., battery maker has climbedsubstantially since the insiders' $15-a-share purchases. InNew York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Duracellshares closed at $24, up 37.5 cents.   Thirteen of the insiders were Duracell executives ordirectors (see accompanying Insider Trading Spotlight chart),and five were partners of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., theleveraged buy-out firm that took Duracell public. There wassome overlap: Four of the 13 Duracell insiders who purchasedshares are also KKR partners or limited partners. Otheremployees of Duracell bought shares, but aren't required toreport their purchases to the SEC under the federal agency'sdefinition of an insider, according to a company spokeswoman.   All told, the company set aside 750,000 shares of the IPO,which was over-subscribed, for employee purchase, she said.An additional 470,000 shares were alloted to KKR.   The insider buyers included Henry Kravis, a member ofDuracell's board and a founding partner of KKR. KKR's EquityFund owns a 70-million-share stake in Duracell, and Mr.Kravis bought 50,000 shares for himself. He couldn't bereached for comment.   ---   WELL-OILED: The largest stock purchase reported to the SEClast week was H.R. Hart's purchase of 50,000 shares of MurphyOil Corp. for $1.7 million. Mr. Hart, a director of theEldorado, Ark., oil company and president of the Nashville,Tenn., brick and limestone firm Franklin Industries Inc.,couldn't be reached for comment. SEC filings show half of theshares were purchased in his name, while another 25,000 werepurchased by Franklin Industries.   Mr. Hart paid $34.81 a share for the stock.
