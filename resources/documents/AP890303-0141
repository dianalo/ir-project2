REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A communist rebel leader on Thursdayrejected President Corazon Aquino's demand that the guerrillas laydown their arms in exchange for peace talks, and guerrillas killedan outspoken anti-communist mayor.   Luis Jalandoni, foreign liaison officer of the NationalDemocratic Front based in the Netherlands, said in an interview witha Manila radio station that the rebels were willing to find apeaceful solution to the 20-year conflict.   ``The (Front) is very willing to find a solution, a negotiatedpolitical settlement for a just and lasting peace,'' said Jalandoni,a former priest. ``But the condition that we should surrender is apre-condition that is impossible.''   Last week, Mrs. Aquino said she was willing to renew peace talksif the 24,000-strong New People's Army lays down its arms.   The Front is an umbrella organization of 12 Marxist groups,including the Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed wing,the New Peoples Army.   Jalandoni said Mrs. Aquino's stand showed the president ``closedher mind to the reality that the NDF is a political force that hasbeen struggling for years, that it has influence over 10,000villages and that it cannot surrender areas and people whosacrificed because of their principles and programs.''   The military claims Jalandoni, who has both Dutch and Filipinocitizenship, is a member of the central committee of the outlawedCommunist Party. Jalandoni is believed to be in charge of rebelfund-raising activities in Europe.   Mrs. Aquino opened peace talks with the Front in 1986 butnegotiations collapsed in January 1987 after she refused rebelpower-sharing demands.   Last week, Front spokesman Satur Ocampo said the rebels wouldconsider resuming peace talks if the Aquino government agreed toclose the six American military bases here when their lease expiresin 1991.   Also Thursday, police said Capistrano Legaspi, mayor of the townof Kinogitan in Misamis Oriental province, was slain Wednesday bythree suspected rebel assassins.   The report said Legaspi was waiting for a ride home when therebels approached and opened fire in the town about 470 milessoutheast of Manila.   Legaspi was an outspoken opponent of the rebel movement.</TEXT></DOC>
