Major resultsare described in this report. Three approaches are examined: classificationof wastes, mixing in the mine and mixing outside the mine. To solve problemsrelated to moisturization of mine waste and flow properties of mixturesof mine and washing process wastes, an effort is made to convert minewaste into one like washing process waste by adjusting the gap betweenthe crushing plates so as to provide mine waste close in grain size towashing process waste, to which water is added subsequently. Water supplyequipment is installed based on experimental data and tests are made.Since the tests show that the water content is slightly insufficient,another water supply is added to the waste pocket, leading to satisfactoryresults. The gap between the crushing plate is adjusted more closelyto give a grain size almost equal to that of washing process waste. Themixed use of these wastes completely eliminates the expenditure for theconveyance and disposal of excavation waste outside the mine, permittinga large cost reduction. (3 figs, 2 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
