The ordinance was approved 7-2 Monday.   Council members also empowered police to impound for up to threedays semiautomatic assault weapons found during patrols. Theordinance would allow police to determine whether the guns arestolen or can be linked to a crime.   Police previously could confiscate a gun only during an arrest.   Several proposals to ban or restrict assault weapons have beenintroduced in the Legislature since last month's schoolyard attack,in which Patrick Purdy killed five children and wounded 30 peoplewith an AK-47 rifle before killing himself.   Los Angeles, Stockton and Compton and Santa Clara County havealso passed bans on assault weapons, but National Rifle Associationmembers last week asked the state Supreme Court to overturn the LosAngeles and Stockton ordinances.   San Diego City Attorney John Witt argued that his city'sordinance would probably be struck down because the state has soleauthority to legislate firearms.   Councilman Wes Pratt, however, said the city needs to take suchweapons out of criminals' hands.   ``Now is the time to act, and this is a reasonable approach,'' hesaid.   Semiautomatic assault weapons fire one round with each squeeze ofthe trigger until the ammunition clip is expended.</TEXT></DOC>
