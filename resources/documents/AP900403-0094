The National People's Congress accepted Deng's resignation fromhis last official government position last week and had beenexpected to pick Jiang for the job.   Jiang was the only candidate. He received 2,682 votes forchairman of the government Central Military Commission. Ten membersof the parliament voted against him and 26 abstained.   One deputy wrote in Deng's name and another entered that ofPresident Yang Shangkun, a general with a strong following in themilitary.   Deng chose Jiang, 63, as his successor. In November, Jiangreplaced him as head of the party Central Military Commission, apolicy-making group with nearly the same membership as thegovernment body.   The military has played an increasing political role since June1989, when soldiers were called in to crush the pro-democracymovement in Beijing. Holding the two military jobs is crucial toJiang's leadership position.   Jiang, a relatively unknown Shanghai party boss, was named headof the 48-million-member Communist Party in June after thedismissal of Zhao Ziyang, who was accused of supporting thepro-democracy movement.   He has supported the hard-line policies of Deng and other partyelders. Jiang has no political power base in Beijing.   Deng, 85, still is considered the most powerful man in China. Hehas described Jiang as the ``core'' of next-generation leaders andasked the military to give the new party chairman their fullsupport.   Jiang has no experience in military affairs and the People'sLiberation Army remains dominated by such old revolutionaries asPresident Yang, 82, who was named first vice chairman of the partyCentral Military Commission in November.   During vote-counting Tuesday in the Great Hall of the People, acrowd of deputies gathered around Hu Qili, a former member of theparty Politburo Standing Committee who was purged along with Zhaofor pro-student leanings.   Deputies extended warm greetings to Hu, asking for his signatureand posing for pictures with him.   Hu, like Zhao, was stripped of all party posts. He escapedofficial criticism, however, and has been allowed to attend a fewpublic functions.   Zhao, still a party member and parliamentary deputy, has notbeen seen since he went to Tiananmen Square on May 19 for a tearfulmeeting with students on hunger strike.</TEXT></DOC>
