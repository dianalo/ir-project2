The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the ICC erred in granting the exemptions from prior approval to Burlington Northern, a holding company that owns the Burlington Northern Railroad Co.    The exemptions were opposed by the Regular Common Carrier Conference, the Transportation Lawyers Association, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the American Trucking Associations. They argued that the kind of exemptions granted by the ICC aren't permitted when a railroad is acquiring a trucking firm.    The commission granted the exemptions in 1985 and 1986, clearing the way for Burlington's purchase of Victory Freightway Systems, Monkem Co., Monroe Trucking, Stoops Express Inc., Wingate Trucking Co. and Taylor-Maid Transportation.    The court, in deciding against the commission, ordered the ICC to reconsider Burlington's acquisition of the trucking companies using a different standard. An ICC official said the commission hasn't decided whether to appeal the decision. </TEXT></DOC>
