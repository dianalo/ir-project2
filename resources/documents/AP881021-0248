No details of Friday's two-hour session would be made public,the sources said.   The committees of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries are trying to come up with the framework for a newproduction control agreement that would end the current oversupplyof oil and help stabilize prices.   Overproduction by OPEC members has had oil prices swerving inrecent weeks between $12 and $16 a barrel, far below the cartel'starget of $18.   Current daily output by the cartel is estimated at close to 21million barrels a day, substantially above the cartel's officialceiling of 15.06 million barrels a day, a total that covers all butone of its 13 members.   Following Friday's session, the ministers were each expected tomeet with their staffs and hold separate bilateral meetings,according to OPEC sources, who agreed to discuss the session onlyif not identified.   The pricing committee consists of the oil ministers of Algeria,Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Indonesia and Venezuela, while the strategycommittee includes the ministers of Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia,Kuwait and Venezuela.   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto told reporters Friday that moremeetings of the two committees were expected before the full OPECmeeting scheduled for Nov. 21.   Subroto also said he did not rule out the possibility of a fullOPEC meeting even before next month's planned gathering.   Before the 90-minute meeting late Thursday, oil ministers ofNigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela all said they would accept anew production agreement only if it included Iraq.   Iraq has refused to be a part of the current production systembecause it was not given a quota equal to Iran, its Persian Gulfenemy in an eight-year war that was stopped by their cease-fireagreement in August.   However, Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said Thursdaythat his country would not accept production parity with Iraq.   The oil ministers of Iran and Iraq sat down together Thursdayfor the first time in an OPEC setting since the cease-fire.   The remaining OPEC members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar andthe United Arab Emirates.</TEXT></DOC>
