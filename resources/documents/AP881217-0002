North.   John W. Keker, 44, who like North was wounded while leading aMarine infantry platoon in action, was chosen on Friday byindependent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to head a three-lawyer teamthat will try North.   Walsh had said he would like to try the North case himself. Buthe said in a statement Friday that he would continue to deal withproblems posed by a wealth of classified documents and supervise thecontinuing investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.   Walsh's spokesman, James Wieghart, said Keker's war record, whichwas not mentioned in the statement, was coincidental to his beingnamed head of the prosecution team.   But Keker's Purple Heart for his combat wound is a serendipitousqualification for the lead prosecutor in the case against North, whohas made patriotism and his own Vietnam service a hallmark of hispublic defense since the Iran-Contra affair unfolded two years ago.   North, 44, who earned two Purple Hearts for combat wounds, worehis Marine uniform when he testified before the congressionalcommittees that investigated the arms-for-hostages deals.   Walsh announced his courtroom team in advance of a hearing nextWednesday by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to begin finalpreparations for North's trial, which could begin as early as lateJanuary.   The former National Security Council aide, who retired from theMarines as a lieutenant colonel following his indictment last March,is accused of conspiring to illegally divert profits from theU.S.-Iran arms deals to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.   Keker, who is on leave from his San Francisco law firm, will bejoined by associate independent counsels David A. Zornow, 33, andMichael W. Bromwich, 34, both former federal prosecutors in New YorkCity.   Zornow investigated and helped try several major municipalcorruption cases in New York.   ``This commits three of our most experienced criminal lawyers tothe case,'' Walsh said.   Walsh repeatedly had expressed an interest in trying the caseagainst North, former national security adviser John M. Poindexterand arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord.   But Gesell's decision to order separate trials for each of thedefendants and the continuing complications of classified documentsand congressional immunity given North, Poindexter and Hakim forceda re-examination of those plans, according to a source who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Besides the original grand jury that indicted North and hisco-defendants, a new panel began meeting this fall to considerpossible perjury by participants in the Iran-Contra affair.   Walsh must be free to oversee the investigations and negotiatewith intelligence agencies about disclosing classified informationthat Gesell says must be included in the proof against North.   Christian J. Mixter, who has been handling the prosecution's caseduring closed proceedings on secret documents in the North case, wasnamed a member of the team of lawyers for Poindexter's trial.   Keker joined the Marine Corps upon graduation from PrincetonUniversity in 1965 and was commissioned a second lieutenant. Sent toVietnam in 1966, he was wounded while leading an infantry platoonnear the Demilitarized Zone. He left the Marines in 1967 and studiedlaw at Yale University.   He later served as law clerk to retired Supreme Court ChiefJustice Earl Warren.</TEXT></DOC>
