The price, which was far below the book value Lomasassigned to the subsidiary as of June 30, 1989, or $324.2million, underscored the erosion of Lomas's net worth sinceit filed for federal bankruptcy-court protection lastSeptember.</LP><TEXT>   But Lomas officials hailed the development, saying that itwould allow the financial-services company to shed theleasing unit's $1 billion of debt and $30.6 million ofpreferred stock. &quot;Although in terms of the recoupment ofequity it was not as high a price as we might have hoped, ourfocus has remained on the fundamental objective&quot; of slashingdebt, Chairman Jess Hay said in an interview.   Mr. Hay said the sale will fulfill the company's goal,formulated last April, of cutting its then $5.8 billion debtload by 60% to 65% and focusing its operations on its coremortgage operations. Debt will be reduced to about $2.3billion if the sale is completed, he added.   The low sale price wasn't unexpected. In its secondquarter ended Dec. 31, Lomas took a $125 million chargeagainst earnings to cover net losses it expected to incur byselling its leasing unit, known as Ellco Leasing Corp., andits life-insurance segment. Lomas said Ellco's book value isnow $164 million, reflecting a write-down of the unit'sintangible assets.   Frank Anderson, an analyst with Stephens Inc., LittleRock, Ark., had previously estimated that the unit wouldbring between $150 million and $200 million. &quot;Once you enterbankruptcy, especially if you're a financial-servicescompany, individual units as a general rule tend todeteriorate,&quot; he said.   Lomas paid about $263.3 million in cash and stock toacquire Ellco from Equitable Life Assurance Society of theU.S. in 1987. The unit, based in San Diego, employs about 300people and leases computer equipment and otherhigh-technology office gear to large corporations throughoutthe U.S.   General Electric Capital Corp., a financial services unitof Fairfield, Conn.-based GE, couldn't be reached forcomment.   Sale of the Lomas unit would require approval from afederal bankruptcy court in New York. Under Chapter 11 of theU.S. Bankruptcy Code, a company receives court protectionfrom creditors while it works out a plan to repay its debts.</TEXT></DOC>
