The Federal Reserve said that the February advance, whichfollowed a 0.3 percent January gain, was the poorest showing sinceoutput actually declined by 0.2 percent in September.   But private economists said the gains, even at a much slowerpace, represented good news for the economy, especially given fearsthat production would have to be cut back sharply in the early partof 1988 in order to work off high levels of unsold goods.   ``There is nothing here that signals anything dangerous for theeconomy,'' said Maury Harris, chief economist at PaineWebber. ``Weare slowing down, but we are not slowing all that much.''   Industrial output had surged ahead with monthly increases of 1.1percent in October and 0.5 percent in both November and December.However, much of that production went into inventories of unsoldgoods as consumer spending fell during the final three months ofthe year.   Economists had worried that factories would cut back productionso much in the early part of 1988 that it could topple the countryinto a recession.   But recent business statistics, including the continued advancesin production, rising consumer spending and strong gains inemployment, have eased those fears.   ``The industrial production figures depict an economy that isgrowing less rapidly but really looks pretty healthy,'' said JerryJasinowski, chief economist of the National Association ofManufacturers.   U.S. manufacturers have enjoyed a significant rebound in outputover the past year as the weaker dollar has boosted export sales.Forecasts of continued economic growth this year are relyingheavily on those advances to cntinue.   Jasinowski said a recent survey of the association's membersfound that a significant 20 percent of the companies were lookingforward to higher sales this year.   ``They see a lot of strength in their markets and very littleprobability of a recession,'' he said.   The February increase included a 0.2 percent rise in productionat manufacturing plants, identical to the gain in January.   Auto production fell 0.9 percent in February and now stands 8.5percent below where it was in October. The output of passenger carswas 6.1 million units at an annual rate, a small improvement overJanuary, but this was offset by a drop in production of lighttrucks.   Factories making durable goods, items expected to last three ormore years, saw output rise by 0.2 percent last month while outputat plants making nondurable goods edged up 0.1 percent.   Output in the mining industry dropped 0.8 percent in February,the third consecutive monthly decline. The setback last month wasblamed on a drop in coal production.   Output at the nation's utilities rose 0.7 percent in Februaryfollowing a 1.8 percent January increase.   The various changes left industrial production at 134.4 percentof its 1977 base of 100.</TEXT></DOC>
