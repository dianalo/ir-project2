Theestimated weighted-average margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation''section of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Case History </ITAG>Since the notice of initiation (53 FR 15076, April 27, 1988), the followingevents have occurred. On May 17, 1988, the ITC determined that there isreasonable indication that U.S. industries are materially injured by reasonof imports of the subject merchandise from France (53 FR 18909, May 25,1988). On May 31, 1988, the Department presented Section A of the antidumpingduty questionnaires to INA Roulements S.A. (INA); SKF Compagnie d`ApplicationsMecaniques S.A. (SKF); and Societe Nouvelle de Roulements (SNR). Thesecompanies account for a substantial portion of exports of the subject merchandisefrom France to the United States during the period of investigation. Theremaining sections of the questionnaire were inssued on June 15, 1988.Responses to Section A were due on June 14, 1988, and responses to theremaining sections were due on July 15, 1988.On July 13, 1988, we issued a decision memorandum stating that the subjectmerchandise constitutes five classes or kinds of merchandise (<T3>see,</T3> ``Class or Kind of Merchandise'' section of this notice).In light of this decision, the Department re-examined the sufficiency ofpetitioner's less than fair value (LTFV) allegations for each class orkind of merchandise from France. The Department afforded petitioner anopportunity to provide additional information in support of its LTFV allegationsfor particular classes or kinds of merchandise where needed. On August1, 2, and 29, 1988, petitioner submitted additional data. We determinedthat petitioner provided sufficient information in support of the LTFVallegations for each class or kind of merchandise from France. After review of this additional data, we determined that petitoiner's LTFVallegations were adequate for each of the five classes or kinds of thesubject merchandise. However, since plain bearings enter the United Statesunder a basket TSUSA category, we are unable to definitively establishwhether plain bearings were imported from France during the period of investigation.In addition, we are unable to specifically identify any French exportersof plain bearings to the United States. Therefore, we have preliminarilydetermined that plain bearings from France are not being, or are likelyto be, sold in the United States at less than fair value. We will continueto attempt to establish whether plain bearings from France were importedand attempt to identify any French exporters of plain bearings to the UnitedStates during the period of investigation for purposes of our final determination.On July 15, 1988, the Department determined that these investigations areextraordinarily complicated in accordance with section 733(c)(1)(B)(i)of the Act, and postponed the preliminary determinations until no laterthan October 27, 1988 (53 FR 27738, July 22, 1988). On August 8, 1988, we issued revised reporting requirements based on ourdecision to simplify these investigations (<T3>see, </T3>``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice).Accordingly, response deadlines were extended several times, with the finaldue date for responses being no later than September 6, 1988. A numberof supplemental questionnaires were issued subsequent to that date. Supplementalresponses were received from the respondents prior to these preliminarydeterminations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Standing</ITAG>During the period April 27 through September 29, 1988, we received numeroussubmissions from parties challenging The Torrington Company's standingto file the petition and requesting dismissal of the petition on the groundsthat it was not filed by ``an interested party'' ``on behalf of'' the UnitedStates industry as required by section 732(b)(1) of the Act. Section 771(9)(c)of the Act defines ``interested party'' to include ``a manufacturer, producer,or wholesaler in the United States of a like product.'' With the exceptionof an additional category for ``other antifriction devices,'' the ITC categorizationof the subject merchandise into six like products is identical to the fiveclasses or kinds of merchandise subject to these investigations. Torringtonhas demonstrated that it produces all five classes or kinds of the subjectmerchandise. Therefore, Torrington is a manufacturer, producer or wholesalerin the United States of the like products under investigation, and is an``interested party'' with standing to file this petition. The statutory provision that governs the standing of parties to bring petitionsrequires the commencement of an investigation ``whenever an interestedparty * * * files a petition * * * on behalf of an industry.'' Section732(b)(1) of the Act. As we have stated in prior cases [(<T3>see, e.g., Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination; CertainStainless Steel Hollow Products from Sweden </T3>(52 FR 5794, February28, 1987) and <T3>Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determinations; Certain TextileMill Products and Apparel from Malaysia </T3>(50 FR 9852, March 12, 1985)],the Department relies upon the petitioner's representations that it hasfiled ``on behalf of'' the domestic industry until it is shown that a majorityof the domestic industry affirmatively opposes the petition. The Departmentbases this position on the fact that neither the Act nor its legislativehistory restricts access to the unfair trade laws by requiring that partiespetitioning for relief under these laws establish affirmatively that amajority of the members of the relevant domestic industry support the petition.The only requirement is that the party filing the petition act as the representativeof the domestic industry. When a member of the domestic industry challenges the assertion of thepetitioner that it has filed ``on behalf of'' the domestic industry, theburden is on the opponent to establish that the petitioner does not havethe support of a majority of the domestic industry. To meet this requirement,the opponent must provide evidence that at least a majority of the domesticindustry affirmatively opposes the petition. Where domestic industry membersopposing a petition provide a clear indication that there are grounds todoubt a petitioner's standing, the Department will evaluate the oppositionto determine whether the opposing parties do, in fact, represent a majorproportion of the domestic industry. In order to determine whether a major proportion of the domestic industryopposes the petition, on October 14, 1988, we issued a questionnaire tothose parties challenging the standing of the Torrington Company. Responsesto the standing questionnaires are due on October 28, 1988. We will continueto examine the standing issue for purposes of the final determinations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigations</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules will be fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule </T3>(HTS) and all the merchandise enteredor withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after that date willbe classified solely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s). Untilthat time, however, the Department will be providing both the appropriate<T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>(TSUSA) item number(s)and the appropriate HTS item number(s) with its product descriptions. Aswith the TSUSA, the HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customspurposes. The Department's written description of the products under investigationremains dispositive as to the scope of the product coverage. We are requesting petitioners to include the appropriate HTS item number(s)as well as the TSUSA item number(s) in all petitions filed with the Departmentthrough the end of this year. A reference copy of the HTS is availablefor consultation in the Central Records Unit, Room B-099, U.S. Departmentof Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230.Additionally, all U.S. Customs offices have reference copies, and petitionersmay contact the import specialists at their local Customs office to consultthe schedule. For a complete description of the products subject to these investigations,see Appendix I attached to this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Class or Kind of Merchandise</ITAG>In our notice of initiation (53 FR 15076, April 27, 1988), we treated thesubject merchandise as one ``class or kind of merchandise.'' Subsequentto initiation, we received numerous comments from petitioner, respondents,and other interested parties in these investigations on whether the subjectmerchandise constitutes one or more classes or kinds of merchandise. Aftercareful consideration of all views expressed, and based on our discussionswith all product experts at the U.S. Customs Service, the ITC, and withinthe Department, we issued a decision memorandum on July 13, 1988, statingthat the subject merchandise constitutes five separate classes or kindsof merchandise, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="16">1. Ball Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof (Ball Bearings)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">2. Spherical Roller Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof(Spherical Roller Bearings) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">3. Cylindrical Roller Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof(Cylindrical Roller Bearings) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">4. Needle Roller Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof(Needle Roller Bearings) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">5. Plain Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof (PlainBearings) </ITAG>This July 13, 1988 decision memorandum is on file in the Central RecordsUnit. <ITAG tagnum="84">Alternative Reporting Requirements </ITAG>Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.38(a), the Department ``normally will examine atleast 60 percent of the dollar volume of exports to the United States fromany country subject to an antidumping investigation.'' Due to the enormousvolume of sales by respondents during the period of investigation and thecomplexity of identifying similar merchandise, we have attempted to reducethe reporting requirements for respondents while maintaining a reasonablebasis for our analysis. Accordingly, on July 15, 1988, we issued a letterto all interested parties requesting comments on two alternatives to ourstandard methodology. One alternative was to select at random a certainnumber of products sold in the United States and to compare the U.S. pricesfor those products with the home market prices of identical or similarmerchandise, as appropriate. The second alternative was as follows: if at least 33 percent by volumeof the respondent's U.S. sales could be compared to home market sales ofidentical products, then fair value comparisons would be limited to identicalcomparisons. If a respondent failed to reach the 33 percent requirementwith identical matches, then, in addition to identical comparisons, wewould compare the largest volume products sold in the United States tosimilar products sold in the home market within each class or kind categoryuntil the 33 percent threshold was met. After reviewing comments from interested parties on this issue, we selectedthe second alternative. The August 5, 1988 memoradum explaining the proceduresoutlined above is on file in the Central Records Unit. <ITAG tagnum="84">Cost of Production Allegations </ITAG>Based on information presented in the petition and supplemental submissions,on April 20, 1988, we initiated an investigation of sales at LTFV fromFrance. At that time, we also initiated an investigation of whether salesin the home market were being made at prices below the cost of production(COP). As stated above, on July 13, 1988, we issued a decision memorandumstating that the products under investigation constitute five separateclasses or kinds of merchandise. (<T3>See</T3>, ``Class or Kind of Merchandise'' section of this notice.)Accordingly, on July 22, 1988, the Department requested that petitionersubmit evidence of sales at below the COP for each class or kind of merchandiseunder investigation for which sufficient information had not been provided.In addition, several respondents objected to the Department's decisionto initiate COP investigations. Citing <T3>Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp. v. United States,</T3> 575 F. Supp. (CIT1983) (<T3>Al Tech</T3>), these respondents argued that petitioner's sales belowcost allegations were deficient becasue they were based on country-wide,rather than company-specific home market pricing data. After review ofthese comments, the <T3>Al Tech</T3> decision, and Section 773(b), on August 22, 1988, we discontinuedthe COP investigations, but allowed petitioner additional time to submitcompany-speicific home market price information to substantiate its allegationsof sales at below the COP. The August 22, 1988 decision memorandum outliningour analysis of this issue is on file in the Central Records Unit. Petitionersubmitted such new allegations of home market sales below the COP. After analyzing petitioner's new allegations and the numerous supplementsthereto, we have determined that a sufficient company-specific allegationhas been provided with respect to SKF ball bearings. Therefore, the Departmenthas reinstated a COP investigation for this product only. <ITAG tagnum="84">Voluntary Respondents </ITAG>On July 1, 1988, we issued questionnaires to companies which had expressedan interest in submitting voluntary responses in these investigations.However, no responses were received. <ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation </ITAG>The period of investigation is October 1, 1987 through March 31, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Such or Similar Comparisons </ITAG>To determine whether there are sufficient sales of the subject merchandisein the home market to serve as the basis for calculating foreign marketvalue, we normally compare the volume of home market sales to the volumeof sales to third countries within each respective such or similar category.In developing criteria for such or similar comparisons, we reviewed thematching criteria set forth in <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Tapered RollerBearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, from Japan,</T3> (52FR 30790, August 17, 1987). In addition, we sought and considered commentsfrom interested parties and consulted product experts at the U.S. CustomsService, the ITC, and within the Department. Given the enormous numberof products sold and the numerous physical permutations among bearing types,it would have been virtually impossible to determine home market viabilitybased on such or similar categories within each class or kind or merchandise.Therefore, home market viability was calculated based on home market andthird country sales of each class or kind of merchandise. Pursuant to our alternative reporting requirements, where 33 percent ormore of U.S. sales by volume were identical in all physical respects tohome market products, comparisions of similar merchandise were unnecessary(<T3>see</T3>, ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice).It those instances where similar comparisons were necessary for a givenclass or kind of merchandise, we instructed respondents first to narrowthe pool of possible product comparisons by matching each of the followingcriteria: (1) Number of rows of rolling elements, (2) load direction, (3)bearing design, and (4) precision rating. Respondents were then to applya ten percent deviation test to each bearing in this pool of possible productcomparisons based on the (a) outside diameter, (b) inside diameter, (c)width, and (d) dynamic load rating to determine the most similar home marketcomparison. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons </ITAG>To determine whether sales of certain AFBs from France to the United Stateswere made at less than fair value, we compared the United States priceto the foreign market value as specified in the ``United States Price''and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price </ITAG>For those sales where the sale to the first unrealted customer took placeafter importation into the United States, we based United States priceon exporter's sales price (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of theAct. The calculation of United States price for each class or kind of merchandisefor each respondent is detailed below. I. Ball Bearings A. <T3>INA:</T3> INA reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See</T3>, ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. All of INA's U.S. sales were ESP transactions. We calculated ESP basedon packed, f.o.b. U.S. warehouse prices to unrelated customers in the UnitedStates. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for foreign inlandfreight and insurance, brokerage and handling (which inlcuded marine insurance,ocean freight, U.S. inland freight and insurance, and containerization),and U.S. duty in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Act. We alsomade deductions, where appropriate, for warranty expenses, credit, andother direct selling expenses incurred in the United States and France,U.S. indirect selling expenses, and non-U.S. indirect selling expenses,pursuant to sections 772(e)(1) and (2) of the Act. For the following expenses, INA used the same allocation rates for U.S.sales of merchandise from INA-FRG, INA-France and INA-UK: brokerage andhandling, foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, packing andnon-U.S. selling expenses. The Department has requested that INA calculateseparate allocation rates, by country, for these charges. Also, INA hascalculated its foreign inland freight, ocean freight and packing basedupon value rather than weight or volume. We have requested that INA calculaterevised allocation rates for these expenses based upon how their costswere incurred (<T3>i.e.</T3>, by weight, volume, etc.). For purposes of the preliminarydetermination, we have accepted INA's allocation rates as the best informationavailable. B. <T3>SKF:</T3> SKF reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See,</T3> ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons.We calculated ESP based on the packed, f.o.b. or delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate,for brokerage and handling, inland freight, marine insurance, ocean freight,and U.S. duty, in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Act. We alsomade deductions, where appropriate, for cash discounts and rebates. Wemade further deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for credit, ``otherexpenses,'' repacking in the United States, technical service expenses,warranty expenses, and indirect selling expenses, pursuant to sections772(e) (1) and (2) of the Act.SKF reported a minimal amount of purchase price sales during the POI; however,SKF did not report complete sales data for these transactions. For boththese reasons, we did not include any purchase price sales in our calculationof United States price.SKF notified us that approximately three percent of its reported U.S. salesof ball bearings were produced in a country other than France. SKF claimsthat although it is impossible for them to separate sales of this merchandisefrom that produced in France, United States prices of multiple-sourcedproducts are comparable. While we will carefully examine this issue atverification, we have included all reported sales in our calculation ofUnited States price as best information available. SKF also notified usthat all reported sales of a certain type of bearing were actually producedin Spain. We deleted all sales of this product from our calculations.SKF claimed that the category ``other expenses'' should be used as an adjustmentto its United States price to account for data entry and invoicing errors.The data included both positive and negative values. Given that SKF didnot provide any information regarding how this adjustment should be treated,<T3>i.e.,</T3> whether it should be added or subtracted from United Statesprice, we added these expenses to United States price.C. <T3>SNR: </T3>SNR reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See</T3> ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons.All of SNR's U.S. sales were ESP transactions. We calculated ESP basedon packed, f.o.b. prices to unrelated customers in the United States. Wemade deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for brokerage and handling,foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, marine insurance, oceanfreight, U.S. duty, and U.S. inland freight, in accordance with section772(d)(2) of the Act. We also made deductions, where appropriate, for discounts.We made further deductions for advertising, commissions, credit, technicalservices, as well as adjustments for indirect selling expenses, pursuantto sections 772(e) (1) and (2) of the Act.SNR calculated credit expense based on the average number of days accountsreceivable were outstanding. We have recalculated credit expense basedon the actual number of days from shipment to payment.For certain transactions, no amounts were reported for brokerage and handling,packing, foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, marine insurance,ocean freight, U.S. duty, U.S. inland freight, and indirect non-U.S. sellingexpenses. As best information available, we found the average of each ofthese expenses and compared it to the average gross price reported. Theresultant percentages were then applied, individually, to the gross pricefor each transaction in which these expenses were not reported.II. Spherical Roller Bearings<T3>SKF: </T3>SKF reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See</T3>, ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice).Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons.All of SKF's U.S. sales were ESP transactions. We calculated ESP for sphericalroller bearings based on the packed, f.o.b. or delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. The adjustments were identical to thosedescribed above for ball bearings.III. Cylindrical Roller BearingsA. <T3>INA: </T3>INA reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See,</T3> ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons.All of INA's U.S. sales were ESP transactions. We calculated ESP for cylindricalroller bearings based on packed, f.o.b. U.S. warehouse prices to unrelatedcustomers. The adjustments were identical to those described above forball bearings.B. <T3>SNR: </T3>SNR reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See</T3> ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons.All of SNR's U.S. sales were ESP transactions. We calculated ESP basedon packed, f.o.b. prices to unrelated customers in the United States. Theadjustments were identical to those described above for ball bearings.IV. Needle Roller Bearings <T3>INA: </T3>INA reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See, </T3>``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. All of INA's U.S. sales were ESP transactions. We calculated ESP for needleroller bearings based on packed, f.o.b. U.S. warehouse prices to unrelatedcustomers. The adjustments were identical to those described above forball bearings. <ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value </ITAG>In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on home market sales. The calculation of foreign market valuefor each respondent is detailed below. I. Ball Bearings A. <T3>INA:</T3> We calculated foreign market value based on delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. We made deductions from thehome market price, where appropriate, for inland freight and home marketpacking. We added U.S. packing to the home market price, in accordancewith section 773(a)(1) of the Act. Since all U.S. transactions involved ESP, we deducted credit expenses fromhome market price. We also deducted indirect selling expenses, in accordancewith 19 CFR 353.15(c). Since all home market products used in fair valuecomparisons are identical to the product sold in the United States, noadjustments for physical differences in merchandise were required. INA included advertising and technical expenses in the claim for indirectselling expenses. It failed, however, to provide an itemized breakdownfor the remainder of the indirect selling expenses claimed. Therefore,we have disallowed all indirect selling expenses, except for advertisingand technical expenses, for purposes of this preliminary determination.If the appropriate information is submitted and verified, we will considerit for the final determination. INA calculated its inland freight and packing allocations based upon valuerather than weight or volume. We have requested that INA calculate revisedallocation rates for these expenses based upon how their costs were incurred(<T3>i.e., </T3>by weight, volume, etc.) For purposes of this preliminarydetermination, we have accepted INA's allocation rates as the best informationavailable. B. <T3>SKF: </T3>We calculated foreign market value based on f.o.b. pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. We made deductions from thehome market price, where appropriate, for inland freight and home marketpacking, and cash discounts and rebates. We added U.S. packing to the homemarket price, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. Since all U.S. transactions involved ESP, we made further deductions fromhome market price, where appropriate, for advertising expenses, credit,and warranty expenses. We also deducted certain indirect selling expensesin accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c). Since all home market products usedin fair value comparions are identical to the products sold in the UnitedStates, no adjustments for physical differences in merchandise were required.SKF's response included a claim for home market ``indirect selling expenses''.Although requested in our original and supplemental questionnaires, SKFfailed to provide an itemized breakdown of the indrect expenses claimed.Therefore, we have disallowed these expenses for purposes of this preliminarydetermination. If the appropriate information is submitted and verified,we will consider it for the final determination. SKF claimed technical service expenses as a direct selling expense. However,that claim was not adequately supported and, therefore, we treated theseexpenses as indirect selling expenses. C. <T3>SNR: </T3>We calculated foreign market value based on packed, ex-worksprices to unrelated customers. We made deductions from the home marketprice, where appropriate, for packing and rebates. We added U.S. packingto the home market price, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.Since all U.S. transactions involved ESP, we made further deductions fromhome market price, were appropriate, for credit. We also made an adjustmentto home market price for indirect selling expenses in accordance with 19CFR 353.15(c). Since all home market products used in fair value comparisonsare identical to the products sold in the United States, no adjustmentsfor physical differences in merchandise were required. SNR calculated credit expense based on the average number of days for invoicingto payment. We have recalculated credit expense based on the reported numberof days from shipment to payment. SNR's response was ambiguous as to when inland freight and inland insurancecharges were included in the reported gross unit price. Because of thisambiguity, we have not deducted these charges from the home market pricefor purposes of these determinations. II. Spherical Roller Bearings <T3>SKF: </T3>We calculated foreign market value for spherical roller bearingsbased on f.o.b. prices to unrelated customers in the home market. The adjustmentswere identical to those described above for ball bearings. III. Cylindrical Roller Bearings A. <T3>INA: </T3>We calculated foreign market value for cylindrical rollerbearings based on delivered prices to unrelated customers in the home market.The adjustments were identical to those described above for ball bearings.B. <T3>SNR: </T3>We calculated foreign market value based on packed, ex-worksprices to unrelated customers. The adjustments were identical to thosedescribed above for ball bearings. IV. Needle Roller Bearings <T3>INA: </T3>We calculated foreign market value for needle roller bearingsbased on delivered prices to unrelated customers in the home market. Theadjustments were identical to those described above for ball bearings.<ITAG tagnum="84">Currency conversion </ITAG>We used the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of U.S. sales,in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the act, as amended by section615 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. All currency conversions weremade at the rates certified by the Federal Reserve Bank. <ITAG tagnum="84">Verification </ITAG>We will verify the information used in making our final determinationsin accordance with section 776(b) of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation </ITAG>In accordance with section 733(d) of the Act, we are directing the U.S.Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of the subject merchandisefrom France, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigations'' section of thisnotice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumptionon or after the date of publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, except for entries of needle roller bearingsfrom INA, in accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act. The U.S. CustomsService shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to theestimated amounts by which the foreign market value of the subject merchandiseform France exceeds the United States price, as shown below.
