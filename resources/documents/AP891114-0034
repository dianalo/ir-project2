The rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front is pursuinga two-track strategy aimed at dramatic changes in one of theWestern Hemisphere's poorest and most polarized countries.   With an estimated 7,000 regular fighters and perhaps twice asmany irregulars, the leftist rebels know they cannot defeat a45,000-man armed force backed by massive U.S. aid.   Instead, they hope to bring about broad social and politicalchange by either making the country so chaotic that the status quocrumbles or by pressuring the new rightist government intoconcessions.   In the eyes of rebel theoreticians, El Salvador could becomeungovernable if a broad-based civilian movement _ encouraged by theorganizational efforts of the rebels or political activists whoshare some of their goals _ meshes with the armed rebel struggle.   ``This insurrection isn't conceived of as a general uprising inwhich the masses will rise up throughout the country at the sametime,'' rebel commander Leo Cabral said recently. ``We have a moreirregular, much less classic concept.''   They see pressure from inside and outside El Salvador as the keyto forcing the government to meet their negotiating terms.   ``The military struggle is a means of backing up demands,''rebel commander Joaquin Villalobos said in an interview in Managua,Nicaragua, last week.   Whether the spectacular and bloody offensive they launchedSaturday night will move them any closer to their goals remained tobe seen. But the rebels clearly put the war back in the spotlight.   ``The only good thing that could result from this would be towake people up, to bring about negotiations,'' said Lutheran BishopMedardo Gomez, a member of a nationwide coalition seeking peacetalks. ``Otherwise we are lost.''   Both U.S. and Salvadoran officials insist the offensive is anattempt to disguise declining rebel military fortunes.   ``I think this is a sign of weakness rather than strength,''U.S. Ambassador William Walker told reporters late Monday.   He said the offensive would not reverse what he called the``fading'' fortunes and legitimacy of the rebel front.   But Walker also called it part of an attempt by the front to``enhance its appearance of strength at the bargaining table.''   The guerrillas stunned the nation by bringing their fight to thecapital as they had never done in 10 years of largely rural,hit-and-run combat.   After nearly 24 hours of heavy combat, the rebels had entrenchedthemselves in neighborhoods along a wide arc on the northern fringeof San Salvador.   They installed themselves in homes and apartments and positionedsnipers in church towers and tall buildings. In many areascivilians, both willing and unwilling, were obliged to providesupport.   Walker said an estimated 1,500 guerrillas were taking part inthe fighting in the capital. The attacks in San Salvador wereaccompanied by at least 50 other coordinated actions nationwide, hesaid.   Civilian casualties appeared high as government helicoptergunships strafed heavily populated areas where the rebels were dugin.   Some feared the offensive would move the government away, nottoward, negotiations by strengthening the hand of theultra-rightists in President Alfredo Cristiani's NationalistRepublican Alliance who have long been accused of links to deathsquads.   ``This will be a test for the government because it has facisttendencies,'' Gomez said as gunfire crackled outside his modestchurch in the city center.   Cristiani imposed a state of seige after the fighting broke out,suspending constitutional rights such as freedom of assembly, andhis government imposed a virtual news blackout. The president alsowarned that political parties ``that might be part of the FMLN''would not be tolerated.   Recently initiated peace talks between the rebels and thegovernment broke down after the Oct. 31 bombing of the headquartersof a union sympathetic to the rebel cause in which 10 people werekilled and 29 were injured.   The rebels, who named the offensive after one of the slain unionleaders, clearly hoped public indignation over the bombing combinedwith the shock of the fierce combat in the capital would helprevive the peace process.   The two sides are far apart and each accuses the other oflacking any real interest in peace.   The rebels say Cristiani's demand that the fighting stop beforeany serious talk on reform begins is like an invitation to suicide.   Cristiani says rebel demands for a purge of the military highcommand and for replacing the Supreme Court are ``totally absurd.''   ``We realize that the FMLN is a reality, that it exists,'' hesaid recently. ``But it is a small reality...''</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Candace Hughes covers Central America for TheAssociated Press and is based in Mexico City.</TEXT></DOC>
