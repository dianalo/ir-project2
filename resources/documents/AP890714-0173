Shirley McVay Wiseman, former assistant secretary for housing atHUD, testified under oath that Pierce instructed her to approve morethan $15 million for a Durham, N.C., project being pushed by aformer law partner of Pierce.   ``I want the project funded,'' Wiseman quoted Pierce as saying.She offered her account in testimony before the House GovernmentOperations Subcommittee on Employment and Housing, one of threecongressional panels investigating the burgeoning HUD scandal.   Wiseman said she told Pierce she could not approve his requestbecause career HUD employees were ``violently opposed'' to it.   Janet Hale, who succeeded Wiseman at HUD, said she felt she was``acting on the approval of my boss'' when she did approve theproject in 1985.   Hale said department procedure required that she ``formally signthe funding documents.'' But she said Pierce's signature was alreadyon the documents approving funding for the Durham project, whichinvolved the conversion of a hosiery mill into apartments.   ``After the secretary had given the approval I was implementinghis instructions,'' said Hale.   Whether Pierce actually signed the documents referred to by Ms.Hale was not clear. Other witnesses have said Deborah Gore Dean,Pierce's executive assistant, often used an electronic ``autopen''to affix Pierce's signature to agency documents.   As a result of HUD's approval, the developers received more than$11.3 million in rent subsidies, a $2.3 million Urban DevelopmentAction Grant and more than $3 million in tax credits, said Rep. TomLantos, D-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee.   In May, Pierce told the subcommittee he set up a three-personpanel at the agency to make funding decisions for the moderaterehabilitation program, one of the programs involved in the Durhamproject.   However, Pierce said he maintained final authority over the HUDcommittee's decisions.   ``I did not plan however to get into the decision-making processof the panel when there was no complaint to justify my doing so,''he said.   Efforts by The Associated Press to reach Pierce for commentFriday were unsuccessful.   ``The factual noose seems to be tightening around Samuel Pierce'sneck,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the HouseBanking Committee.   ``We were very careful about asking him if he had ever tried toinfluence any project and we have two people making it very clearthat he wanted a particular project funded,'' said Rep. ChristopherShays, R-Conn.   ``I want to give him every opportunity to clarify the apparentcontradictions,'' said Lantos. He said the committee would seek torecall Pierce before Congress takes a recess on Aug 4.   In response to a question from Shays, Wiseman also contradicted astatement Ms. Dean gave to investigators from the HUD inspectorgeneral's office during an interview for their audit of the moderaterehabilitation program.   Dean had said Wiseman served on the internal panel.   ``I did not serve on a committee and I didn't know it existed,''she said.   Hale said she deferred signing three waivers in the spring of1985 that would qualify the Durham project for federal aid, eventhough she was directed to approve them by Dean.   She said she was uneasy about the directive because of unanimousopposition to the project from department professionals, and soughta personal meeting with Pierce. Hale said she spoke to Pierce abouthaving a meeting but that one never took place.   She said among her questions were concerns about possible toxicwaste at the mill site. She said other department aides assured herthere was no evidence of such waste at the site, but she said shewas never shown any documentation.   Lants read from a memo dated Sept. 24, 1984 _ a year earlier _noting complaints from HUD field staff members that they had beenpressured by the central office not to mention environmentalproblems at the site.   ``I was told the secretary wanted it. Deborah asked me to signthe waivers. I was told to sign them, and I did,'' Hale testified.   The panel also questioned the pair about another troubled HUDentity _ the coinsurance mortgage program.   Wiseman testified that DRG Funding Corp., the largest privatelender that underwrote mortgages in the $5 billion program, wasremoved from administrative probation despite concerns about thecompany among HUD professionals. The company now is under FBIinvestigation.   She said DRG's ability to underwrite mortgages had been placed onhold because of infractions of department rules, and former HUDsecretary Carla Hills met with her in late 1984 or early 1985 to getthe restrictions lifted. ``It was not a convincing argument,''Wiseman said, and the restrictions were left in place.   ``It was later brought to my attention that Hills had ... takenthe case to secretary Pierce. I was informed by staff that there wasa meeting,'' and DRG's probation was lifted, she said.   Citing one DRG project, Colonial House in Texas, which wasapproved on Sept. 11, 1984 after the mortgage company's probationwas lifted, Lantos said the project went ``belly up.''   DRG had coinsured a loan of $47.2 million for the project whichsold for $8.9 million. Under the program, HUD is liable for about 80percent of any defaults.   Hills is scheduled to testify before the committee Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
