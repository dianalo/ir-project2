A commission officials said Thursday there is no evidence thatcommercial play sand causes cancer, but the commission will make aformal decision on a petition to ban limestone products, includingplay sand, in September.   Industry officials say if sand from the nation's rock quarriescaused cancer, there would be higher instances of the disease amongworkers in the centuries-old industry.   Public Citizen, a non-profit organization which fights forproduct safety and public health, said in a news release Thursdaythat many of the nation's children could be exposed to play sandthat contains dangerous asbestos or asbestos-like tremolite fibers.   ``During the hot summer of 1988 your children may be playing inthe sandbox. Would you want them to be breathing asbestos as theypour buckets of sand over each other?'' the consumer group asked.   Asbestos fibers have been proven to cause cancer when inhaled.Children who are exposed to them may not be afflicted until manyyears after exposure, the group said.   In a letter to the product safety commission, Public Citizensaid that if the agency does not indicate within 30 days that itplans to resolve the issue, the group will consider legal action.   Appeals to the safety commission to protect workers andconsumers from exposure to rock-based fibers date back 12 years. InMay, the agency said it had evaluated several play sand samples anddid not find asbestos in any of them.   Public Citizen, however, said sand sold under two brand names,Basins Play Sand and Quickrete Kiddie's Fun Sand, have been shownby tests to contain tremolite, a rock-forming mineral that canoccur in an asbestos form.   ``No one knows how many other brands may be similarlycontaminated,'' the group said.   An official of Package Pavement of Stormville, N.Y., adistributor of Kiddie's Fun Sand, said five outside tests have beenconducted on its sand and none found harmful ingredients.   ``All indications are that there is no such fiber in our playsand,'' said Eileen Doherty, vice president for marketing. She saidsand from a quarry in Connecticut does contain tremolite, but in acrystalline form which is not harmful.   Sandra Eberle, safety commission program manager for chemicalhazards, said no one has found true asbestos in play sand. She saidthe fiber-like particles that have raised concern are not tremoliteasbestos but ultra-thin cleavages from crystalline tremolite thatoccur in some marble-based sand.   ``It's very upsetting to us because parents get naturallyterrified. I've spent a lot of time on the phone telling peoplethis is not asbestos,'' she said.   Ms. Eberle said, however, that the commission is stillconsidering a petition by New Jersey geologist and physician MarkGermine to ban all limestone products, including play sand, lawnand garden limestone and consumer gravel products.   Rick Renninger of the National Stone Association, whichrepresents the industry, said the claim of cancer-causingingredients in sand is old and is not backed up by the evidence.   ``We produce a billion tons of stone a year in the UnitedStates, and we've been doing it for a couple of hundred years,'' hesaid. ``I think that there'd be evidence of asbestos diseaseproblems in people exposed for their entire working lives, andthere simply isn't.''   Renninger said tremolite is among the most common rock-formingminerals and is found in almost every rock product.   Public Citizen researcher Dr. Lynn Silver, a pediatrician,accused sand distributors of trying to hide the danger of theirproducts.   ``The industry throws up a smokescreen,'' she said in aninterview. ``If somebody dies from falling off the left side of askyscraper, they tell you there's nothing to prove that falling offthe right side is also dangerous.''</TEXT></DOC>
