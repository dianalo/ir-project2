Section 2O2 of the Housing Act of 1959 provides direct loans for thedevelopment of housing for elderly or handicapped residents. Section 162of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 amended section 202as it applies to housing for handicapped people, providing a new systemof rental assistance to replace the assistance provided under section 8of the United States Housing Act of 1937 for other section 202 projects.In developing the final rule to implement the provisions of section 162,some revisions were made to the information collection requirements thatwere approved for the proposed rule (published at 53 FR 44288). Furtherefforts to streamine the program procedures led to reductions in some requirements.In other instances, efforts to improve program flexibility and to providemore specific information for rating projects resulted in increased requirements.All of the affected sections are covered by OMB No. 2502-0267 and dealwith application requirements for the program and requests for direct loanprocessing.2. The information contained in the application provides the documentationneeded to evaluate the applicants who propose to develop projects for handicappedpeople with direct loans under section 202. Competition for fund reservationsis intense, and detailed information is necessary in order to assess therelative merits of the proposal and the strength of the applicant organization.In Fiscal Year 1988, for example, there were 494 applications for 9,479units for handicapped people. Of these, only 5,221 units were selectedfor fund reservations.The specific changes proposed, and purpose of each, is noted below:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,i1,s25,r75</C> <H1>Regulatory section</H1><H1>Change and purpose</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">885.710 Application Submission<D>Three reductions were made in order to simplify the information collectionrequirements:</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D/><T3>Section 885.710(b)(6)(i)</T3> deleted a redundant requirement to restatethe occupancy category to be served as part of the service plan description.This information is provided elsewhere in the application.<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D/><T3>Section 885.710(b)(6)(ii)</T3> changed the requirement to demonstratethat a proposal did not conflict with state or local policies, making itapplicable only where service funding is received from those sources.<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D/><T3>Section 885.710(b) (14) and (15)</T3> added a request for applicantsto provide, to the extent the information is available, data on race, ethnicity,gender and handicap status of persons served in programs operated by theapplicant. This information will allow the Department to evaluate moreaccurately the extent of the Sponsor's previous experience serving handicappedpeople, and the Sponsor's record in reaching minority handicapped persons.In the combined elderly/handicapped program as formerly administered, applicantswere asked to provide information about any past or current involvementin housing or service programs that would give evidence of management capability,but without asking for data on persons served. In rating the applications,one rating factor was the Sponsor's experience in providing services tolower-income minority persons, yet the specific data on which such an assessmentcould be made was not requested.<P>With the inclusion of this requirement, applicants will have the opportunityto demonstrate both their experience serving handicapped people, whichis central to the objectives of the program, and their record in servingminority handicapped persons. Since minority populations have a higherincidence of handicapped persons, and are historically underserved, theDepartment considers it appropriate to take this experience into considerationin selecting among the numerous applicants for the program.</P><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D/><T3>Section 885.710(b)(21)</T3> revises the proposed requirement that theentire application be sent to the State Single Point of Contact for reviewunder Executive Order 12372 and provides instead that only the informationrequired by the State be submitted. In most cases, this will be no morethan a brief description of the proposed project and its location.<ITAG tagnum="1">885.720(c) Project Size Limits<D>This section provides criteria for approval of independent living projectsthat exceed the regulatory size limits. The maximum size is being reducedfrom 40 to 24 units, but a mechanism for approving larger projects whereappropriate is provided in order to assure that needed housing can be builtin large metropolitan areas where the smaller projects would not be economicallyfeasible. The detailed information requested is necessary in order to determinethe validity of the request for approval of a larger project. The Sponsormust demonstrate the appropriateness of the project for its location andits marketability as well as justify the exception on the basis of economicfeasibility.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">885.800(d) Request for Direct Loan Financing<D>This section allows projects to bypass the conditional commitment stageunder certain circumstances and go directly to firm commitment, therebyreducing paperwork requirements associated with making two separate requestsfor direct loan processing. This provision was introduced in order to simplifyprocedures wherever possible in an effort to expedite project development.The proposed allowed projects to bypass conditional commitment under amore limited set of circumstances.</D></ITAG></ITAG>3. In developing the rule and other documents to implement this program,HUD considered carefully modifications to the application package and toprocessing requirements. The authorizing legislation for this program hasas a major objective the simplification and adaptation of the program toreflect the needs of handicapped projects. As noted above, some duplicationof information was identified between the proposed and final rulemaking,and has been eliminated. Other requirements were simplified to reduce theburden. The proposed increases in information collection were the minimumnecessary to allow HUD to establish an equitable selection system and toconduct the program in accordance with statutory requirements.4. Where duplication was identified, it has been eliminated as noted above.5. Not applicable. Individual applicants are rated on the merits of theapplication submitted, each of which is unique. The application relatesto a specific proposed project.6. This revision proposes two additional requirements. The request forinformation on race, ethnicity, gender and handicap of persons served bythe applicant in other programs is not a mandatory requirement and collectsonly information already available to the applicant, therefore it doesnot impose a significant additional burden and indeed an applicant maybe successful without submitting such data. The second item was providedin order to accommodate the need for housing for handicapped people inlarge urban centers, and again applies only to those who wish to take advantageof the exception. Only that information specifically required to make thedetermination on the request is collected.7. The collection occurs annually as necessary to conduct the competitionfor program funds each fiscal year.8. This request for information is consistent with the guidelines under5 CFR 1320.6.9. The Department conducted a one-day Issues Forum on the development ofproposed rule which was attended by representatives of organizations whichsponsor section 202 housing, consultants who specialize in projects forhandicapped people, HUD Field Office personnel, and disability advocates.In addition, HUD established an Advisory Committee on Housing for HandicappedFamilies which met to review the regulations and program policies and proceduresin detail. The Advisory Committee, which met on April 7, 1989, includedrepresentatives of disability organizations, disabled people, housing providers,and State agencies which serve disabled people. A list of Committee membersis attached. Specific recommendations of the Committee were incorporatedin the rulemaking. In addition, the Department considered the 38 publiccomments received in response to the proposed rule. The preamble to thefinal rule discusses all of these comments in detail, and describes theaccommodations made in response.10. HUD does not assure confidentiality.11. The requirement does not contain any sensitive questions.12. The estimated cost to the respondent per application, $2,750, is expectedto be reduced by $50 as a result of the reductions, primarily the reducedsubmission to the State Single Point of Contact under Executive Order 12372.Cost to the Federal Government, estimated at $1,750 per application, willnot be affected.13. The estimated number of respondents is based on the number of applicationsreceived annualy. In FY 1988, 494 applications were received for projectsfor handicapped people. Over the past four years, an average of 389 applicationshave been received annually. The estimated burden hours represented bythese revisions are:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,tp0,i1,s25,6,3,6,6,8</C> <H1>No. of activity</H1><H1>Responses/responses</H1><H1>Total annual respondent</H1><H1>Hours/responses</H1><H1>Response</H1><H1>Total hours</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Application Submission 885.710<D>450</D><D>1</D><D>450</D><D>27</D><D>12,150</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Approval for Projects Exceeding Size Limits 885.720<D>10</D><D>1</D><D>10</D><D>2</D><D>20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Request for Direct Loan Processing 885.800<D>150</D><D>1</D><D>150</D><D>11.2</D><D>1,680</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>50</D><D>1</D><D>50</D><D>8.2</D><D>410</D><R>n,n,n,n,n,s</R><ITAG tagnum="4">Total Burden<D/><D/><D/><D/><D>14,260</D></ITAG></ITAG> 14.
