 But a Windows 3.0 version due out in thefirst half of next year could weaken the case for OS/2.andM;InfoAlliance, the software application jointly announced by SoftwarePublishing Corp., Microsoft Corp. and IBM Corp., integrates data fromdifferent mainframe, minicomputer and microcomputer databases for users whowant to get information from a variety of sources and develop quickapplications without programming.andM;An upcoming release of InfoAlliance for client/server networks will let usersview a single, virtual database that includes data from Microsoft's SQLServer and IBM's mainframe DB2.andP;  End users will be able to developapplications and reports from easy-to-use screen prompts.andM;The software announced at Networld was written for Microsoft's OS/2Presentation Manager graphical interface, but a Microsoft Windows 3.0 versionfor MS-DOS will be shipped in the second quarter of 1991.andP;  Applicationsdeveloped with OS/2 Presentation Manager will run under Windows 3.0 withoutchanges, a company official said.andM;Priced from $8,500 to $99,500, the first release of InfoAlliance lets up to200 users directly access IBM OS/2 Extended Edition Database Manager anddBase III Plus and dBase IV file formats.andP;  InfoAlliance also imports andexports to Lotus 1-2-3, delimited ASCII files and Harvard Graphics charts.andM;Other data sources will be integrated in future releases, Software Publishingofficials said.andP;  InfoAlliance helps users be more productive andself-sufficient and reduces the support burden on MIS, they said.andM;InfoAlliance includes an administration program that lets system managers setuser access privileges and protect data integrity.andM;Software Publishing, which makes the popular Harvard Graphics software,announced it had created a corporate division to market and support the newdata source integration software product.andM;Codenoll Technology Corp. demonstrated Ethernet-compliant, plastic fiberoptictechnology at Networld and announced it soon would have products at pricescompetitive with unshielded, twisted-pair hardware.andP;  Officials fromCodenoll's Yonkers, N.Y., headquarters said they would announce specificproducts for plastic fiber local area networks later in the year.andM;&quot;What we have now is a LAN connector and cabling system that is less complexto use than today's telephone components,&quot; Codenoll's president Michael Codensaid.andM;Rather than push the limits of copper-based technology to meet the demand forgraphics and image processing, Codenoll officials said they will offerplastic optical fiber as a substitute for coaxial and twisted-pair LANwiring.andP;  It takes less than a minute to cut a piece of plastic fiber andattach a connector, they said.andM;Codenoll officials promised Ethernet-compliant products that will be easierto install and test than either shielded or unshielded twisted-pair whileoffering the higher data rates and reliability of fiber-optic networks.andO;Fiber-optic products are immune to electromagnetic interference and can beinstalled near copy machines and elevator shafts.andM;&quot;Plastic optical fiber is the most cost-effective solution for work groupnetworks from 10 megabits to 300 megabits per second,&quot; Coden said.andP;  Glassoptical-fiber would remain the preferred media for network backbones,long-distance coverage and the highest performance networks, he said.andM;Informix Software Inc. will offer its Unix OnLine database engine as adatabase server for NetWare networks, making it possible to build and runmultimedia, large-scale applications on these LANs.andM;Shipped SoonandM;Initially designed for Unix networks, the Informix-OnLine client/serverdatabase engine will be shipped before the end of the year as a loadablemodule for Novell Inc.'s NetWare 386 operating system.andM;Informix of Menlo Park, Calif., has a large installed base of Unix databaseapplications in the Internal Revenue Service, U.S.andP;  Customs Service, LaborDepartment, Treasury Department and Navy.andP;  The company is working with theNational Security Agency to develop a B1-level secure database managementsystem based on the Informix-OnLine database engine.andM;Informix-OnLine, designed for networks with many users accessing a number oflarge, shared databases, lets users store spreadsheets, word processingdocuments, digitized images and voice as ordinary fields in a databaserecord.andM;&quot;Informix-OnLine for NetWare 386 reinforces our open systems focus by makingour leading DBMS technology available in the standard operating environmentfor local area networks,&quot; said Informix spokesman Jeff Bork.andP;  The newdatabase server for NetWare 386 combines the functionality of Informix-OnLinefor Unix with support for the multithreading capabilities and 32-bitarchitecture of NetWare 386, he said.andM;The $4,995 NetWare 386 version of OnLine has an installation program thatlets users installing the database engine specify their skills as beginner,intermediate or advanced.andP;  For users with little technical expertise, theinterface presents questions about the organization's database needs and,based on the answers, automatically configures such complex parameters as logbuffers and shared memory.andM;NCR Corp. chose Networld to announce its move into wireless LAN technology,with a Novell-compatible LAN interface card for office networks.andP;  The Dayton,Ohio, company's new WaveLAN products use the spread-spectrum radiofrequencies approved by the Federal Communications Commission for datacommunications.andM;NCR's $1,390 WaveLAN network interface card comes with NetWare 2.1x driversand an omni-directional antenna housed in a 3-inch-square case.andP;  The WaveLANadapters transmit data at 2 megabits/sec within a maximum radius of 800 feetin an open office.andP;  Coverage is limited to a radius of 100 feet in enclosedoffice environments.andM;NCR WaveLAN networks can be connected over longer distances or linked tocabled networks by having a wired connection from one WaveLAN PC into abackbone cable.andM;An NCR systems engineer heads the Institute of Electrical and ElectronicsEngineers P802.11 working group to develop standards for wireless LANs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
