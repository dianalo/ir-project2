Though the concentrations were generally small, sometimes theyreached 100 times the levels found in typical outdoor air, theagency said.   ``No one knows what the health effects are at thoseconcentrations,'' said Chris Rice, the agency's spokesman on airpollution.   The agency released a report on its surveys of indoor air in 1983through 1987 in 10 buildings around the country, together with apamphlet of advice for homeowners on indoor air quality problems.   The pamphlet generally advises homeowners to try to get rid ofthe sources of air pollutants indoors, such as stopping smoking; touse judicious ventilation such as kitchen exhaust fans; and not tokeep unused products that might give off contaminants, such asleftover paints and aerosols.   EPA has published pamphlets on particular indoor polluantsbefore, such as radon gas, but never on the general subject as awhole.   A new office building in Research Triangle Park, N.C. ``had thehighest concentrations for most of the volatile'' compounds, thereport said. ``However, by the third trip, most of the compounds haddecreased considerably.''   The office building air was checked just after the building wascompleted in 1983, one month later, and five months later.   For example, the median concentration of a common solvent,1,1,1-trichloroethane, dropped from 290 micrograms per cubic meterof air just after completion to 40 micrograms five months later.   ``Many of the volatile organics many originate from cleaningagents'' and pesticides, the study suggested.   Such chemicals have attracted increasing attention in recentyears as a source of ``sick building syndrome,'' responsible forflu-like episodes among employees.   EPA itself is the subject of a union complaint about chemicalsgiven off by new carpets in a section of the agency's Washingtonheadquarters.   Besides the North Carolina office building, the EPA surveyed twohomes for the elderly, a public school and office building inWashington, D.C.; a hospital and an associated nursing home inMartinsburg, W.Va.; an office building in Fairfax, Va., a nursinghome in Worcester, Mass., and an office-and-classroom building atHarvard University in Cambridge, Mass.</TEXT></DOC>
