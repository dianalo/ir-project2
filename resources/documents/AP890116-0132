WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenbergsays the government now believes a Libyan chemical factory iscapable of producing poison gas, according to a report publishedMonday.   At a news conference, Stoltenberg again revised the officialrecollection of when Bonn first learned of possible West Germaninvolvement in the plant. He also said a government company may haveaided the construction unknowingly.   Belgian prosecutors announced a second arrest involving theplant. They said Jos Vleminckx of the now-bankrupt Antwerp shippingfirm Sanexomar was charged with falsifying cargo documents, the samecharge brought against Jozef Gedopt, manager of the Antwerp companyCross Link, who was arrested last week.   A German magazine said a U.S. company provided a computer for theLibyan plant.   The Saudi Arabian daily Al Sharq al Awsat quoted Ihsan Barbouti,an Arab consultant, as saying he designed the complex and it washeavily guarded, but he did not believe it was making poison gas.   West German officials had maintained for three weeks that theyhad seen no proof of U.S. assertions that the plant in Rabta, Libya,is intended for the production of chemical weapons or that WestGerman firms helped supply it. Libya says the plant is apharmaceutical factory.   Die Welt newspaper published an interview with Stoltenberg in itsearly Tuesday edition, which was available in Bonn Monday evening.   ``We must assume that the factory is a facility in which poisongas can be produced,'' he was quoted as saying. He said he based theassumption on ``concrete indications'' and intelligence reports.   Die Welt also quoted Stoltenberg as saying confiscated documentsopened up a ``possibility, or a suspicion,'' that any West Germanfirms involved in the plant could be guilty of illegal transactions.   The documents were seized last week from the now-defunct I.B.I.Engineering company of Frankfurt.   At the news conference, Stoltenberg said his ministry had ``vagueinformation'' on the Libyan plant in early August. On Friday,Chancellor Helmut Kohl's spokesman corrected official statements toreflect that intelligence sources linked West German companies tothe Libyan project in mid-October.   Stern magazine said it would report in Thursday's editions thatthe German chemical company Imhausen-Chemie had obtained from theU.S. electronics company Harris Corp., ``through indirectchannels,'' the central computer for the Libyan chemical plant.   The nationally circulated weekly sent the report by telex to newsmedia.   The magazine did not elaborate, but said Harris, based inMelbourne, Fla., specializes in aircraft and satellite electronicsand works closely with the U.S. Defense Department.   Harris officials denied the report.   ``We have made as thorough a search of our records as possible inthe time available, and to the best of our knowledge we have sold nocomputers to Libya either directly or through a third party,'' saidspokesman Peter Carney. ``In particular, we have no record ofselling any computers to the German company Imhausen.''   Stern also said Salzgitter Industriebau GmbH, a subsidiary of theWest German government-owned Salzgitter AG, made blueprints for theplant, about 40 miles outside of Tripoli.   Salzgitter AG denied the report but said in a statement that itssubsidiary was involved with Imhausen-Chemie, identified by U.S.officials as a key participant in the Libyan plant, in constructinga pharmaceutical plant in Hong Kong.   Salzgitter AG manufactures steel products and industrialequipment, and Salzgitter Industriebau specializes in developingindustrial plants.   Stoltenberg said Salzgitter Industiebau may have been anunwitting participant in the Libyan plant.   The developments cast further doubt on Bonn's handling of thematter, which has dominated West German news reports for three weeksand complicated relations with the United States.   U.S. allegations of a West German hand in the plant were madepublic in late December.   Bonn officials said then that they could find no evidence tosupport the accusations. After an initial probe of Imhausen-Chemie,the government cleared the chemical company of any illegal tradeactivity with Libya.   Last week, however, Kohl acknowledged mounting indications ofWest German involvement and said some firms could face criminalcharges.   His spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, announced on Friday thatintelligence officials had informed Bonn in mid-October of suspectedWest German ties to the plant. The government had said a weekearlier that it knew nothing of the case until Kohl's visit toWashington Nov. 15.   A regional prosecutor in Offenburg now is investigating theexport activities of Imhausen-Chemie.   At the news conference, Stoltenberg repeated the government'sposition that there are insufficient grounds for a federal criminalinvestigation of companies alleged to have been involved.   ``We are a democracy. We have to take care of legal grounds,'' hesaid. ``We cannot act on rumors.''</TEXT></DOC>
