The price runup was sparked by reports that AMR, the parent of American Airlines, has engaged two top Wall Street securities firms, Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc., to help defend the Dallas company against unwanted overtures. AMR wouldn't comment, but one person familiar with company strategy said the two firms were signed to &quot;a standard engagement letter, a typical defense retainer.&quot;    Volume in AMR was heavy, with nearly 3.9 million shares changing hands in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. AMR has 58.9 million shares outstanding. Much of the volume was handled through the Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. trading desk, leading to speculation that a single buyer might be accumulating stock. However, individuals familiar with the trading said there wasn't any sign of that.    Meanwhile, financially ailing Pan Am Corp., still looking for a merger partner, said it hasn't yet decided whether to propose buying Continental Airlines, the nation's fifth-largest carrier, from parent Texas Air Corp. Last week, Frank Lorenzo, Texas Air's chairman, disclosed the company may consider selling a minority or controlling interest in Continental. Later, it was learned that Scandinavian Airline Systems and an unidentified partner are in advanced discussions with Texas Air for a possible stake.    Airline analysts said they think AMR could be worth more than $120 a share, or more than $7.2 billion, based on measures used in the recent $3.65 billion takeover of NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines, by Los Angeles investor Alfred Checchi. AMR's stock has already more than doubled from $40.875 within the past year, and has risen 74% in 1989 alone. This year, American surpassed United Airlines to become the U.S.'s biggest airline in terms of revenue and number of passengers. In 1988, AMR earned $806.5 million on revenue of $8.82 billion.    Among those rumored to be buying AMR shares was Texas investor Robert Bass, who has shown an interest in both NWA and UAL Corp., United's parent. He couldn't be reached to comment.    AMR's stock-price action prompted Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis, who sparked the takeover of NWA and is now bidding for UAL, to deny rumors that he has a stake in AMR. Mr. Davis is particularly sensitive to any suggestion he may have shifted his sights away from UAL, for which he has made a bid of $6.19 billion, or $275 a share. The United Airlines pilot union is working on a possible bid for the company.    If someone is accumulating a major stake in AMR, the company appears to share one important vulnerability with UAL and NWA. Two analysts who have read the AMR charter said it allows a consent-solicitation procedure under which shareholders can vote to oust the entire board at any time. Mr. Davis succesfully used the threat of such a vote to pressure both NWA and UAL.    On the other hand, AMR Chairman Robert Crandall, the aggressive boss who has steered American for years, could be expected to try to ward off the kind of situation that has engulfed NWA and UAL. AMR directors earlier this month bolstered the company's poison-pill defense, an anti-takeover measure designed to make a hostile buy-out prohibitively expensive. And AMR has been exploring other ways to enhance its stock value, such as selling its computer reservation system for upwards of $2 billion.    &quot;Bob Crandall has in the past seemed adverse to a concept of a leveraged buyout, as it would limit the flexibility of the company,&quot; said Karen Firestone, who runs the air transport mutual fund at Fidelity Investments in Boston. &quot;He might feel that leveraging the company at a time when he sees tremendous growth opportunities would be a mistake.&quot; One airline analyst speculates that a buy-out at an NWA-level pricetag would triple AMR's debt to $9 billion.    Instead Mr. Crandall, known as a cutthroat competitor, might welcome the chance to compete on an unleveraged basis against the likes of United and NWA, some on Wall Street believe.    Paul Karos, an airline analyst at First Boston Corp., said that while AMR is a takeover candidate &quot;from a statistical point of view,&quot; the biggest uncertainties are whether management resists or Congress intervenes.    Congress has been in recess during the takeover battle for United. If lawmakers return to Washington next month to find the nation's two largest airlines facing leveraged takeovers that reduce their financial stability, they may put pressure on the Bush administration to step on the brakes.    Meanwhile, how actively Pan Am pursues Continental Airlines depends in large part on whether Pan Am can be sure that any deal worked out with Texas Air will go through. Pan Am's losing bid for NWA cost it a special $28 million charge for the second quarter, and the company can't afford to run up more fees on another losing bid, many analysts say. The carrier posted a $7.7 million second-quarter loss and is running behind its earnings projections for the year.    Together, Pan Am and Continental would be a seriously debt-ridden airline. They already have two of the highest debt-to-equity ratios in the industry and suffer from many of the same problems, such as aging aircraft fleets and low employee morale. However, Pan Am does have $830 million in tax credits that could shelter profits, and North Atlantic and Latin American routes that could be combined with Continental's domestic system to produce a strong international competitor.    ---   Bridget O'Brian contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
