The experiments are conducted at the Clinton P. AndersonMeson Physics Facility at Los Alamos (LAMPF). The experiments are performedin collaboration with UCLA, George Washington University, LAMPF GroupsMP-4, MP-10 and MP-13, and Catholic University. The measurements include:(1) a complete set of observables in the pion-nucleon system in the momentuminterval 400 to 700 MeV/c, (2) differential cross sections at low energyfor pion-nucleon charge exchange, and (3) elastic and inelastic scatteringof {pi}/sup +-/ on {sup 3}H and {sup 3}He.</TEXT></DOC>
