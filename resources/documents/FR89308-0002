Neville, (202) 632-6817.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On March 21, 1988, OPM published (at53 FR 9121) proposed regulations to amend 5 CFR Part 339 governing medicalqualification determinations. At the same time, the corresponding FPM chapterwas sent to agencies, unions, and professional organizations for comment,and was made available to the general public. We received comments from28 agencies, 7 professional organizations, 3 unions and 1 individual. Keyaspects of the final regulations are summarized below, followed by a discussionof the more significant comments received on both the regulations and theFPM, as well as OPM's responses. <ITAG tagnum="84">Key Provisions of the Final Regulations </ITAG>1. Delegate to agencies authority to establish medical standards for occupationsthat predominate in one agency (i.e., a single agency standard), as wellas authority to establish appropriate physical requirements for individualpositions in accordance with OPM-prescribed criteria. (5 CFR 339.202 and203) 2. Clarify the authority for agencies to establish medical evaluation programsnecessary for safeguarding employee health. (5 CFR 339.205) 3. Clarify an agency's authority to require medical examinations for employeesoccupying positions subject to medical standards, medical evaluation programs,or physical requirements. (5 CFR 339.301) 4. Allow agencies specific authority to examine employees injured on thejob, but only for the purpose of determining employees' qualificationsfor reemployment, not for entitlement to compensation. (5 CFR 339.301)5. Clarify that routine pre-appointment examinations are not allowed forpositions that are not subject to specific medical standards, physicalrequirements, or a medical evaluation program (in other words, where healthstatus is not an important component of a position, there is no authorityto require a medical examination). (5 CFR 339.301) 6. Establish that agencies have the right to designate the examining physicianwhen they order or offer an examination. (5 CFR 339.303) 7. Allow the agency to order psychiatric examinations (or psychologicalassessments) when specifically required by medical standards or a medicalevaluation program, or when a general medical examination which the agencyis otherwise authorized to order under these regulations rules out of physicalcause to explain actions or behavior causing performance or conduct problemson the job. The examinations may be performed by a licensed practitionerauthorized to conduct such examinations, in accordance with accepted professionalstandards. (5 CFR 339.301) 8. Clarify that the agency pays for all examinations that it orders oroffers. The employee pays for all other examinations. (5 CFR 339.304) 9. Provide a regulatory basis for the existing agency authority to disqualifynonpreference eligibles for medical reasons, and for OPM review of themedical disqualification of 30 percent or more compensably disabled veteransby the U.S. Postal Service. Require agencies to provide a higher levelreview within the organization for medically disqualified nonveterans.(5 CFR 339.306) 10. Provide that all actions under this regulation must comply with RehabilitationAct requirements and EEOC regulations governing the employment of individualswith handicaps. (5 CFR 339.103) <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments Received and OPM Response </ITAG>Relationship to Drug Testing Program <T3>Comment: </T3>One agency asked that the relationship between theseregulations and Executive Order 12564, ``Federal Drug Free Workforce,''be clarified. <T3>Response: </T3>We have clarified the relationship in the FPM. Coverage <T3>Comment: </T3>One agency asked that we make it clear that these regulationsdo not restrict an agency from conducting, under independent authority,medical examinations to determine an individual's eligibility for a securityclearance. <T3>Response: </T3>OPM recognizes that certain laws or executive ordersmay authorize an agency to conduct medical examinations as part of itssecurity program and the regulations do not intend to preclude such actions.However, OPM sees no reason to amend the regulations based on this agency'scomment. Agencies that believe they have independent authority to conductmedical examinations under their security clearance programs are in thebest position to make and defend such determinations. Establishing Physical Requirements <T3>Comment: </T3>Several agencies questioned the provision that physicalrequirements be approved by agency headquarters, citing the burden thiswould impose, particularly on large agencies with a wide range of jobshaving physical requirements.<T3>Response: </T3>Upon further review, we agree this could prove burdensome.We have therefore changed this provision in the chapter to provide forperiodic review by agency headquarters of physical requirements establishedby individual components. This should be sufficient to ensure consistencyand fairness. Establishing Medical Standards <T3>Comment: </T3>One agency and a union questioned the criterion of a``reasonable relationship'' between a medical standard and the duties ofthe job as being too loose, and not consistent with the criteria for establishingphysical requirements. <T3>Response: </T3>We have amended this section to require a ``direct relationship''to the actual requirements of the position. <T3>Comment: </T3>One agency and a union believed medical standards shouldonly be established by OPM. <T3>Response: </T3>Consistent with the Administration's policy of delegatingmaximum operating authority to individual agencies, OPM has allowed agenciesto establish selective factors, according to their own individual needs,which have the effect of amending the qualification standards for a position.This has worked well. Allowing agencies to establish modified medical standardsin accordance with OPM-prescribed requirements is a logical extension ofthis authority. However, we plan to monitor agency use of this authoritycarefully. Medical Evaluation Programs <T3>Comment: </T3>One agency recommended that medical evaluation programsbe authorized only for jobs that expose employees to significant healthhazards. Where the purpose of the medical examination is to detect impairmentsthat could interfere with an individual's performance on the job (ratherthan injuries to the employee's health <T3>caused </T3>by the job), the agency suggested that the position shouldbe covered by ``medical standards'' rather than a ``medical evaluationprogram.'' <T3>Response: </T3>We generally agree and have revised this section accordingly.However, the nature of the job could pose a risk to others (for example,hospital workers who may have an infectious disease), so there is a needto allow examinations not only because of potential injury to the employee,but to others as well. <T3>Comment: </T3>One agency suggested we make clear that the authorityto establish medical evaluation programs includes immunization programsfor certain health care workers. <T3>Response: </T3>We have clarified this as suggested. <T3>Comment: </T3>One union commented that the proposed standard for allowinga medical evaluation program was too broad. <T3>Response: </T3>We have tightened the criteria by providing that theneed for a medical evaluation program must be clearly supported by thenature of the position. Medical Examinations <T3>Comment: </T3>One union commented that when an agency orders or offersan examination, the employee must be allowed to choose the doctor to protectprivacy interests. <T3>Response: </T3>OPM believes it is appropriate for the agency to designatethe physician_both when it orders an examination (given that the employeemust also be given an opportunity to submit additional information fromhis or her own physician), and when the agency offers (and pays for) theexamination. The agency may, of course, decide to designate the employee'sphysician. However, since the employee has ample opportunity to submitadditional information, and since the agency has a reasonable interestin controlling the source of the information in those circumstances wherean agency-ordered or offered examination is appropriate, no change in theproposed regulations is warranted. It is important to emphasize, in thiscontext, that the regulations do not contemplate that personnel managementdecisions would be made by the physician, be it an employee or agency-identifiedphysician. The deciding official is a supervisor or manager who uses availablemedical information from any source as one component influencing his orher decision. Finally, privacy is not the issue here, because any medicalinformation obtained by the agency_whether from the individual's own doctoror from an agency-designated physician_is subject to the same Privacy Actrequirements. <T3>Comment: </T3>One union expressed concern about a change in the existingregulations which would allow an agency to refer an employee for psychiatricevaluation rather than requiring that such exams be ordered by a physician.It believed this might allow a supervisor to refer an employee for a psychiatricexamination because of harmless, idiosyncratic behavior. The union alsoasked that this provision be tightened to allow such examinations onlywhen the employee fails to perform ``in a safe and efficient manner'' ratherthan when there are ``performance or conduct problems,'' as proposed. <T3>Response: </T3>We have tightened the language as suggested by the union.If any event, this change would not permit an employee to be referred fora psychiatric evaluation because of harmless, idiosyncratic behavior. Beforeany employee can be referred for a psychiatric evaluation, two factorsmust be present: 1. The employee's performance or conduct must be such that it may affectsafe and efficient performance, <T3>and </T3>2. A general medical examination which <T3>the agency has the authority to order under these regulations </T3>doesnot indicate a physical explanation for the performance or conduct problems.Since in this context the general medical examination would leave unansweredfrom a <T3>physical </T3>standpoint the reason for the performance or conductdeficiencies, the examining physician in effect would be recommending thata psychiatric examination is indicated. The agency, then, using the resultsof the general medical examination along with its own day-to-day knowledgeof the employee, is authorized under the regulations to order a psychiatricexamination. <T3>Comment: </T3>One union also advocated that OPM set detailed and strictlyconfined guidelines for the permissible scope of required examinationsand limit medical inquiries to those areas that have been specificallypinpointed as posing a problem. <T3>Response: </T3>OPM and EEOC regulations already restrict the basison which an agency can make any inquiry into a individual's medical statusto those issues which are directly related to safe and efficient performance.We have, nevertheless, included a specific reminder in the FPM that agenciesmay not request medical information which is not pertinent to the decisionat hand. <T3>Comment: </T3>A professional association urged that only board certifiedpsychiatrists, not psychologists, be allowed to conduct mental status examinations,primarily out of concern for proper diagnosis and treatment. <T3>Response: </T3>Psychologists are licensed by all 50 states and theDistrict of Columbia to provide a wide range of mental health services,including psychological testing, evaluation, and treatment. They can testifyin court as to a person's mental competence. The purpose of these regulationsis simply to allow mental health professionals (psychologists and psychiatrists)to conduct general screening to determine a person's qualifications foremployment; it is typically not to prescribe a treatment regimen. Suchexaminations are well within the psychologist's professional qualificationsand licensure requirements.Payment for Examinations<T3>Comment: </T3>Several agencies wanted the flexibility to require applicantsto pay for their own pre-employment examinations, citing the financialburden that a requirement to pay for these examinations would impose. Onthe other hand, one union insisted that the agency should pay for all examinationsby a non-agency doctor, even those where the employee chooses the physicianin lieu of being examined by the agency's physician. <T3>Response: </T3>Given the conflicting views about who should pay fora medical examination and when, the many and varied situations in whichan examination might be indicated, and the concern that candidates maybe required to undergo expensive pre-employment medical examinations evenwhen they are not under serious consideration for a position, we believethe most appropriate and clearest approach is to require the agency topay when it orders or offers the examination, and to require the employeeto pay when the employee seeks a specific benefit or accommodation. (Thisis also the current policy.) Medical Documentation<T3>Comment: </T3>One union suggested that the scope of medical documentationrequired under these regulations should be specifically limited to itemsthat directly affect safe and efficient performance.<T3>Response: </T3>The definition of medical documentation in the proposedregulations was unchanged from the definition in the current regulations_andthe clear intent was alway to limit medical documentation to material whichwas ``relevant and necessary'' to make personnel determinations under thistitle. To ensure that there is no misunderstanding on this point, we haveincluded a clarifying statement to this effect in the FPM.<T3>Comment: </T3>One union strongly opposed the provision allowing agenciesto require medical documentation (under penalty of disciplinary actionfor refusal) whenever there is evidence of a health problem which may affectsafe and efficient performance. The union believed this amounted to requiringthe employee to prove he or she was medically qualified, and would be subjectto abuse by allowing an agency to remove an employee without having toprove the individual's performance or conduct was unsatisfactory. <T3>Response: </T3>This authority was intended to allow agencies to directlyaddress questions about an employee's health status where safe and efficientperformance was at issue, without having to take disciplinary action basedon performance or conduct. However, upon further consideration, we arepersuaded that the current regulatory framework, which places the burdenon employees to come forward with medical information if they wish agenciesto consider a medical condition in connection with agency actions basedon performance or conduct, is the preferable way of resolving these issues.We have therefore deleted this provision. When health status is believedto be an issue, an agency can still <T3>offer </T3>an employee the opportunity to resolve it through submissionof medical documentation or by examination with an agency physician. <ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation  </ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because it affects only Federalemployees.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 339  </ITAG>Civil rights, Government employees, Handicapped, Health.
