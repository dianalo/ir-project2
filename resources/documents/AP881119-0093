SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan signed legislation Saturdaydesigned to counter the wave of insider trading scandals that rockedWall Street several years ago and shook the confidence of thenation's investors.   The measure doubles the maximum criminal penalties for insidertrading from five years in jail to 10 years, and boost fines from$500,000 to $2.5 million for a company and from $100,000 to $1million for an individual.   It also holds firms liable to fines for the actions of theiremployees if the firms ``knowingly or recklessly'' fail to detectand prevent insider trading.   Contrary to some of the publicity given to other bill signings inrecent weeks, the White House simply put out a brief announcementthat Reagan had signed the bill. Congress passed the legislation inthe final days of Congress in October.   ``Greed and fear are competing emotions, but until now there hasnot been a proper balance between the two. I think now the fear ofapprehension is going to be at least as great as the lure ofgreed,'' Rep. Edward J. Markey, D- Mass., chief sponsor of the billand chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the securitiesmarkets, said after the measure's final passage.   Markey predicted the bill will change attitudes toward insidertrading, a crime that is both hard to detect and difficult to prove,because, he maintained white collar criminals fear the prospects ofgoing to jail.   The legislation would also:   -Authorize the Securities and Exchange Commission to offertipsters a bounty of up to 10 percent of any fine collected.   -Codify the right of investors to sue inside traders if they lostmoney by trading in the same securities and at the same time asinsiders.   -Permit the SEC to issue subpoenas and investigate insidertrading on behalf of foreign countries, with the idea that foreigncountries would offer reciprocal privileges to the United States.   The SEC and the industry had been pushing for a legislativedefinition of insider trading, which until now has been defined byregulators and the courts.   But, to win the support of House Energy and Commerce ChairmanJohn Dingell, D-Mich., the bill left insider trading undefined.   Dingell believes a written definition would in effect become aroad map to evasion, providing defense attorneys with loopholes. Theindustry complains it is unfair to give only vague guidance.</TEXT></DOC>
