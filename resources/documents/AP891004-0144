The flood of would-be East German emigres in Czechoslovakia,Poland, Bulgaria and East Germany came as the beleagueredgovernment in East Berlin said it would allow one more exodus ofdisillusioned citizens.   The statement covered an estimated 11,000 weary refugees who hadconverged on the West German Embassy in Prague, but there werereports thousands of others throughout the East bloc were hopingtake part.   In Prague, the first of 15 trains began carrying East Germans tothe West on Wednesday evening.   ``We knew it was our last chance,'' one of the East Germans toldreporters before departing. ``We were right, now the border isclosed.''   East Germany, hoping to end the embarrassing exodus of itsyoung, skilled citizens before the Communist nation celebrates its40th anniversary this weekend, on Tuesday closed its border withally Czechoslovakia to keep its people home.   Because Czechoslovakia was the only nation where East Germanscould travel without receiving special permission, thousands hadstreamed here to seek asylum.   The clampdown on travel also was likely to severely curb thenumber of East Germans going to reform-minded Hungary, whichspurred the exodus last month by allowing thousands of East Germansto pass through. The shortest route to Hungary from East Germany isthrough Czechoslovakia.   West German border guards noted that only 500 had arrived viaHungary on Tuesday, compared to 700 the day before and 1,000 theday before that.   East Germans were frantically trying other avenues to catch whatthey feared would be their last chance to reach West Germany, wherethey are granted automatic citizenship.   In East Berlin, police Wednesday scuffled with about 50 EastGermans trying to enter the U.S. Embassy, witnesses said. Eighteenothers made it inside the compound Tuesday, U.S. diplomatic sourcessaid.   ``This is our last hope,'' said one refugee in the group of 10adults and eight children. ``We're not going to budge until we knowwe'll be able to leave.''   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said theBush administration was talking to East German diplomats to resolvethe crisis.   In East Germany in general, there were reports of thousands offrantic citizens lining the rail route that the weekend freedomtrain had taken.   Police beat people with truncheons to disperse a defiant crowdof 5,000 that packed a Dresden train station and lined the tracks,chanting ``We want out!'' witnesses told The Associated Press.   The trains were to travel through East German territory viaDresden to the West German border town of Hof. The detour throughEast Germany was requested by East Berlin authorities so that therefugees could be formally expelled from their country.Czechoslovakia had vowed not to let East Germans emigrate to theWest across its borders.   According to reliable East German sources, four East Germansstill were seeking asylum in the West German mission in East Berlin.   There were also unconfirmed reports that four East Germans hadsought asylum in Bonn's embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria.   In Warsaw, Poland, the number of East Germans seeking asylum atthe Bonn Embassy swelled to 400. About 130 arrived Wednesday. Many_ their clothing still wet _ told of swimming rivers and evadingborder police to get to the embassy.   East Germany's state railroad provided 15 trains to transportthe 10,000 East Germans who had crowded the Prague embassy and thestreets just outside it.   The trains had been scheduled to leave Tuesday night but wererepeatedly delayed.   West German officials first said technical difficulties appearedto be the reason. However, later they said it could have been dueto the East Germans lining the tracks in their own country hopingto join the exodus.   ``That would be a plausible reason _ that some people perhapswould have wanted to jump on the trains going by,'' West Germangovernment spokesman Hans Klein told the ZDF television network.   Refugees in and around the baroque palace that houses theembassy fought the bitter cold with hot tea, huddling underblankets or wrapping themselves in jackets sent out by those whohad found a place inside the building.   Parents cradling children sat in the littered street outside.Inside the embassy garden, about the size of a football field, thetrim lawns were trudged to a sea of mud.   Police in the West German border town of Hof said about 1,000young East Germans were waiting along the tracks near Plauen, anEast German town near the Czechoslovak border.   Hungarian and West German media reported thousands more hadcrowded other spots along the route the trains were expected totake.   On Sunday, about 7,000 East Germans arrived in West Germanyafter East Germany allowed thousands crowded in embassies in Pragueand Warsaw to leave. Many of those who arrived said they had jumpedon board as the trains passed through their homeland.</TEXT></DOC>
