Nearly 280 people were reported killed in thefighting, including 12 in Kabul.   Pakistani officials denied a report that their governmentordered Afghan guerrillas to attack the Afghan city of Jalalabad inMarch.   But diplomatic sources in Kabul said there were deep divisionswithin Pakistan's military and government on whether the Moslemguerrillas should have attacked the city, which government troopshave successfully defended.   President Najib has repeatedly accused Pakistan of violating theGeneva Accords that paved the way for the final Feb. 15 withdrawalof Soviet forces from Afghanistan, ending nine years of militaryinvolvement.   Defense Minister Shahanway Tanai, in remarks made Friday but notreleased by the government until Sunday night, said thegovernment's ``patience is not endless. The Pakistani side shouldkeep in mind that its soil will come to lie under Afghanistan'srocket strikes.''   He said that although Pakistan claimed it was not involved inthe war, ``The direct participation of the Pakistani militaristsorganizing the anti-Afghan aggression is a clear-cut reality now.Therefore, we reserve ourselves the right to show a similarreaction toward the attack of a foreign state.''   He said Kabul could seek Soviet help.   The diplomatic sources said up to 8,000 guerrillas have died inthe battle for Jalalabad, compared to 2,000 government soldiers.They said the guerrillas, who are supported by Pakistan and theUnited States, were severely outmanned.   An Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman said at least 265 peoplewere killed and 123 injured Sunday in Jalalabad and three othercities.   In addition, at least 12 people died and 21 were wounded Sundaywhen three rockets slammed into northern Kabul, official RadioKabul reported.   The claims could not be independently verified.   The ministry spokesman, who refused to be identified further,said four civilians were killed and 10 people, including twogovernment soldiers, were wounded Sunday in Jalalabad. He said 79guerrillas were killed and 51 injured.   Guerrillas attacked the southern town of Khost, injuring twocivilians Sunday, he said. Government forces returned fire, killing161 insurgents and injuring 10, according to the spokesman.   Fourteen more guerrillas died in Kandahar, and 40 guerrillas andfour soldiers were injured, the spokesman said.   Insurgents also fired rockets into Herat, killing four civiliansand wounding six, he said. Three guerrillas were killed, he added.   In Islamabad, a Pakistan Foreign Ministry official denied areport in The New York Times on Sunday that Pakistan ordered Afghanguerrillas to attack Jalalabad.   The newspaper said Islamabad ordered the attack following aMarch 5 meeting that included U.S. Ambassador Robert Oakley.   The attack on Jalalabad began March 6.   ``There is no truth in the report,'' said a senior diplomat inthe Pakistan Foreign Ministry, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   ``Afghans, including the (guerrillas), are very independentpeople. They do not take orders from anyone regarding their ownaffairs, much less about the conduct of fighting in theircountry,'' the official said.   Queries to Oakley's office were referred to the office of KentObee, chief of the U.S. Information Service in Islamabad. Obeerefused comment.   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, on a visit to Peshawar, Pakistan,where the largest rebel groups are headquartered, did not reponddirectly to the report but told reporters: ``We want a politicalsolution to the Afghan issue but we do not want to thrust our willon others. It is our considered opinion that being an issue of thepeople of Afghanistan, they should settle it themselves.''   Afghan guerrilla sources said they were unaware of any suchmeeting March 5 and scoffed at the idea Pakistan was in a positionto issue orders.   Diplomats in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidthere were disagreements within the military and government inPakistan over whether the Jalalabad assault was a good idea.   Shortly after Soviet forces completed their withdrawal fromAfghanistan on Feb. 15, several rebel commanders said Jalalabad, 42miles from the Pakistan border, would be their first objective.   But the battle has stalemated.   One diplomat termed the raid a ``suicide mission.'' He saidthere were 12,000 guerrillas around the city, compared with 20,000government soldiers. He said insurgents need a 3-to-1 advantage totake the city.   Pakistan, the United States, China and several Moslem countriesback the guerrillas but deny direct involvement in the war.</TEXT></DOC>
