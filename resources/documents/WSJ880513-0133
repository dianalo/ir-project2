Seib and Alan Murray (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> PUB </IN><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ronald Reagan is a president who rarely gives orders, meekly follows plans and schedules composed by others and often doesn't understand the intricacies of the issues he faces.    That isn't a portrait painted by Michael Dukakis, James Wright, Walter Mondale or any other Democratic rival. Rather, it's the picture of President Reagan that emerges from a series of kiss-and-tell books by former top aides, the latest of which is the celebrated book by the former chief of staff, Donald Regan.    Though each of these authors claims to be an admirer of the president, their biting first-hand accounts are far more damaging to President Reagan's image than anything that has been charged by his enemies. &quot;If you have even one witness, the court will pay attention,&quot; says James David Barber, a presidential scholar at Duke University. &quot;When you have four or five witnesses, that's quite significant.&quot;    Before Mr. Regan published his account, books were produced by former presidential spokesman Larry Speakes, former confidant Michael Deaver, former budget director David Stockman, former Secretary of State Alexander Haig and former domestic adviser Martin Anderson. The mosaic that emerges from some of the little-publicized anecdotes in those books shows a passive chief executive who often is manipulated by staff members far more ambitious and driven than he is.    Even Mr. Anderson, whose book is generally kind and avoids the kiss-and-tell stories prevalent in the other books, acknowledges that aides saw in Mr. Reagan's presidential campaigns that he &quot;had one distinctive personality trait that was highly unusual, perhaps unique for someone who rose to the high level of managerial responsibility he attained. He made no demands, and gave almost no instructions. Essentially, he just responded to whatever was brought to his attention and said yes or no, or I'll think about it. . . . But we rarely talked about it among ourselves and never to outsiders. We kept it a secret.&quot;    ---   Mr. Reagan often acts only when prodded, according to anecdotes recounted in several of the books, and even then doesn't fully comprehend the power of his office. Mr. Deaver, for instance, recalls that during Israel's 1982 seige of Beirut he walked into the Oval Office and announced that he was resigning because Mr. Reagan wouldn't stop Israel's bombings of the Lebanese capital. Mr. Deaver told Mr. Reagan that he could stop the siege simply by calling Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and telling him to stop it. The president looked stunned; he immediately called Mr. Begin and told him the bombing must end. Twenty minutes later, the Israeli leader called back to say he had ordered a halt. President Reagan put down the phone, Mr. Deaver recounts, and said: &quot;I didn't know I had that kind of power.&quot;    ---   Former Chief of Staff Regan says the president would follow the schedule his staff prepared for him each day &quot;religiously,&quot; never questioning it or making changes. &quot;He regarded his daily schedules as being something like a shooting script in which characters came and went, scenes were rehearsed and acted out, and the plot was advanced one day at a time.&quot; His only complaint, according to Mr. Regan, came at Thanksgiving, when he was regularly scheduled to be photographed with a live turkey. &quot;The President always groaned when he saw this event on his schedule,&quot; Mr. Regan writes, &quot;and more than once suggested that the vice president stand in for him.&quot;    The president often apologized for asking his advisers &quot;startling(ly) basic&quot; questions, according to Mr. Regan's book, and his grasp of issues sometimes was vague and impressionistic. During 1982, when the economy was in recession, the president called Mr. Regan to discuss high interest rates. &quot;He mentioned a story he had read or heard about a small bank in Indiana that had reduced its interest rates on car loans in order to help local automobile sales,&quot; Mr. Regan writes. &quot;Hundreds of cars are being sold in that community, the president said. Couldn't we get all the banks to do the same thing?&quot;    ---   Mr. Speakes recounts that during dress rehearsals for a press conference after the Iran-Contra scandal broke, White House aides posing as reporters twice asked Mr. Reagan questions about whether third countries were involved in U.S. arms sales to Iran. Twice Mr. Reagan gave the incorrect answer that no third parties were involved, Mr. Speakes writes. Both times aides corrected the president, reminding him that Israel's role in shipping U.S. arms already was widely known. Yet when the real press conference was held and Mr. Reagan was asked about Israel's role, he again denied that the U.S. condoned any shipments from third countries. The White House issued an immediate correction.    ---   The president's views often seemed to be shaped by simplistic anecdotes. In a story also recounted by Mr. Regan, Mr. Stockman tells how the president frequently repeated one story to illustrate his ideas about reducing the nation's massive budget deficit. In the vehicle registration department in California, the president recalled, &quot;they kept the records in thousands of metal filing cabinets. Except the records were twice as wide as the file drawers. . . . We just ordered new metal cabinets which were twice as wide, so the records would fit without folding. It saved thousands of work hours. This is the kind of thing that management can accomplish.&quot;    Mr. Stockman writes that he would hear &quot;the filing cabinet story many times over the next four years. It was the single lens through which the President viewed the federal budget.&quot;    ---   The president's aides learned they could appeal to the president by using simplistic illustrations. Budget Director Stockman recounts Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's efforts to get President Reagan to support the Pentagon's huge defense buildup, rather than the budget office's scaled-back version. &quot;Incredibly, Weinberger . . . brought with him a blown-up cartoon. It showed three soldiers. One was a pygmy who carried no rifle. He represented the Carter budget. The second was a four-eyed wimp who looked like Woody Allen, carrying a tiny rifle. That was -- me? -- the OMB defense budget. Finally, there was G.I. Joe himself, 190 pounds of fighting man, all decked out in helmet and flak jacket and pointing a M-60 machine gun at-me again? That imposing warrior represented, yes, the Department of Defense budget plan.&quot;    ---   The White House argues that Mr. Reagan's detached operating style is well-known and irrelevant. &quot;The president's management style and his personal methods of leadership and management have been discussed in any number of forums,&quot; and they have produced &quot;one of the most successful presidencies of this century,&quot; maintains Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman.    And indeed, the kiss-and-tell books cite examples when Mr. Reagan's distant style produced desired results. Mr. Speakes, for example, recalls when President Reagan called a Sunday afternoon meeting of top advisers to discuss mounting unrest in the Philippines against President Ferdinand Marcos. For about an hour, Mr. Reagan said nearly nothing as his advisers debated U.S. options. Finally, he spoke up and said he had decided on a plan: The U.S., capitalizing on a dialogue started by President Reagan's friend, Nevada Sen. Paul Laxalt, would privately tell Mr. Marcos that the U.S. would help him leave his country and subtly threaten to cut off aid to the Philippines if he didn't go. Two days later Mr. Marcos was gone, and Mr. Speakes concluded: &quot;It was the Reagan White House -- at its best.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
