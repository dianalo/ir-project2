In a hospital in nearby Kaiserslautern, the mother of a youngchild screams and faints when she realizes the boy's face has beenburned away.   At an emergency burn center near Mannheim, a mother weepsquietly and says, ``It would be better if our daughter does notsurvive.''   These are scenes from the aftermath of the Ramstein air show aweek ago, when three Italian jets collided during a stunt and onecrashed into a huge crowd of spectators and exploded.   Fifty-one people died, 15 remain unaccounted for and more than160 are hospitalized.   Within an hour after Sunday's crash, volunteers set up acasualty information center in the base theater to help locate themissing.   ``People were crying and in a panic,'' recalled Airman StoneyGlover, a volunteer who was working at the center shortly after thedisaster.   ``They were shaking and looking desperately to find theirrelatives,'' Glover said. A few hours after the crash, ``one womanjust wandered through the hall in a daze, calling out the name of amissing relative,'' he said.   About 300,000 people attended the show and watched in horror asthree Italian jets collided during a high-speed stunt, sending oneflaming aircraft plunging into the crowd.   Hundreds of spectators rushed to the information centerimmediately after the crash, Glover said.   ``By then the area at the crash site had been sealed off,''Glover said. ``They had no where else to turn to.''   Glover, of Orlando, Fla., said after word of the accidentspread, the center was flooded with calls from worried relatives inthe United States.   ``People were calling in hysterics, trying to find out thewhereabouts of sons or daughters stationed here,'' Glover said.   As volunteers at the center worked frantically to reunitefamilies and friends, relatives of the severely injured faced grimemergency ward scenes.   ``Relatives who arrived after the accident were confronted withsights that no one can prepare for,'' said Werner Overbeck, head ofsurgery at Kaiserslautern City Hospital, where 98 victims weretreated.   ``Many patients had suffered burns that made them unrecognizableto their families,'' Overbeck said.   ``It was pandemonium here'' the day after the crash, said anemergency room receptionist. ``I saw a woman scream and faint whenthey brought her son in on a gurney. His face was gone.''   One young mother, after visiting her daughter at the burn unitin a hospital near Mannheim said: ``It is difficult for parents tosay, but it would be better if our daughter does not survive.''   The woman told the Frankfurt Abendpost newspaper that the childhad suffered burns over 70 percent of her body, including her face.It was not known if the girl survived.   Two Americans were among the dead. Most of the dead and hundredswho were injured at the air show were West Germans.   Alfred Witt of Trier found out Friday his 16-year-old son Mariowas dead after discovering the boy's housekey among long rows ofitems found on the bodies of victims who had been so mutilated theycould not be identified, the Bild newspaper reported.   ``They wouldn't let us see the dead,'' the father said.   Days after the accident, some families were still waiting forword about missing relatives.   ``Every time the phone rings our emotions sweep from hope todespair,'' the Abendpost quoted Gerd Wagner of Nuremberg as saying.   Twelve-year-old Andreas Wagner had left the rest of the familyto get a closer look at the aerobatic display, his father said.   ``I thought to myself, `Nothing can happen to him,''' Wagnersaid.   In the turmoil after the accident, many injured family memberswere sent to different hospitals.   ``We are treating the parents of a seriously injured girl herein Kaiserslautern,'' Overbeck said. ``The little girl is fightingfor her life in a hospital near Ludwigshafen.''   Overbeck and other specialists said many of the most severelyburned probably will die of complications over the weeks to come.   While grief for lost loved ones is enormous, Overbeck saidrelatives of the maimed and the victims themselves will face uniquepsychological burdens long after they leave the hospital.   ``These people must now deal with the pain of disfigurement andloss of function for months and years to come,'' Overbeck said.   Jeffrey Nelson, a psychiatrist stationed at Ramstein, saidattendance at a special grief clinic on base soared after theaccident.   ``What we are seeing is a classic disaster response,'' Nelsonsaid. ``At first, people were too stunned to talk. Now they aremoving through other stages of guilt, anger, depression andanxiety.''   ``Anyone who has gone through such an experience has their senseof life's predictability and security taken away,'' Nelson said.   He said the sessions are open to Americans and West Germans andare being expanded to include all personnel at the base.   ``We need to move quickly to get them to talk about it beforethey close up and withdraw,'' Nelson said.   At Ramstein's busy west entrance, the only sign of the tragedyis a flickering red candle and bouquet of flowers placed along theroadside by an unknown mourner.</TEXT></DOC>
