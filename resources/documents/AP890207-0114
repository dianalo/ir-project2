Rollins, who managed PresidentReagan's 1984 re-election campaign, is taking charge of GOP effortsto end Democratic dominance of the House, GOP sources said Tuesday.   Rep. Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan, chairman of the HouseRepublican Campaign committee, plans to announce Wednesday thatRollins has agreed to serve four years as deputy chairman andexecutive director of the committee.
