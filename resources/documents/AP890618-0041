The army's statement did not say whether the unspecified numberof soldiers and civilians it arrested had tried to carry out theirplan.   The capital was calm Sunday, and there was no sign of militaryactivity. No soldiers were deployed in the city center or aroundmajor buildings.   The civilian government of Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi issued nostatement.   Earlier Sunday, 2,000 people calling for a return to militaryrule demonstrated in central Khartoum. However, there was noimmediate indication the protest and the arrests were related.   The communique from the Sudanese Armed Forces General Commandsaid further details on coup plotters would be announced later. Thestatement emphasized that the army remained united and ``wouldcontinue to protect the present democratic regime which has been thechoice of the Sudanese people.''   Military sources identified the leader of the allegedconspirators as Sadek Abdel-Aziz, an officer from the army's ArmoredCorps Division. The sources, who demanded anonymity, refused to givehis rank.   After 16 years as president, the pro-Western Nimeiri wasoverthrown by the military on April 26, 1985 after a widespreadcivil disobedience campaign. The coup occurred as Nimeiri wasreturning from the United States, and he was given political asylumin Egypt as long as he refrained from political activities.   Mahdi came to power one year later in parliamentary elections,but his weak coalition government has failed to significantlyimprove Sudan's ailing economy or end the 6-year-old civil war inthe south.   In a rare interview with The Associated Press in Cairo earlierthis month, Nimeiri called on the Sudanese people to overthrowMahdi's government, which he described as a ``government ofthieves,'' to pave the way for his return.   Despite warnings from the Egyptian government that he wasviolating the conditions of his asylum, Nimeiri said he sent tapesand printed speeches to Sudan last month, accusing Mahdi of causingthe country's problems.   Nimeiri also told a Sudanese biweekly last week that he would bereturning to Sudan ``within a couple of weeks'' and that hissupporters inside the Sudanese army and the government would helpreturn him to power.   Sudanese complain bitterly about Mahdi's failure to solve theirproblems, and sometimes suggest that Nimeiri's regime was better.   Mahdi last year accused Nimeiri's supporters of trying tooverthrow the goverment. Nimeiri acknowdleges only that he senttapes to Sudan urging the people to overthtrow the government lastmonth and in 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
