 But sites that create multiplatform networks for publishing run upagainst two major problems: sending files from Mac to PC or vice versawithout ending up with a pile of gibberish and ensuring that massive graphicsfiles don't bog down the network.andM;Many mixed sites that could profitably be networked aren't.andP;  Unfamiliaritywith the options is one cause.andP;  &quot;Lots of people, if they've tried TOPS orAppleShare/PC, don't know that there are effective Mac-to-PC networkingsolutions,&quot; said Craig Cline, associate editor at Seybold Publications Inc.'sMalibu, Calif., office.andM;The meaning's in the translation.andP;  Probably the simplest way to transfer textand graphics files between PCs and Macintoshes is to choose software thatexists for both platforms.andP;  Microsoft Word, Excel and Works; Aldus PageMaker;WordPerfect; and Adobe Illustrator are examples of mainstream applicationsthat spare you the agonies of data translation.andP;  In addition, VenturaPublisher for the PC will be joined by a Macintosh edition by the end of thisyear, according to Ventura Software Inc. of San Diego.andM;Using only compatible applications, however, limits users to software thatmay not be ideal for their needs.andP;  Also, many mixed networks must be set upin environments where PC and Mac users have long been using applicationsincompatible with each other.andM;Compatibility is a must when it comes to using fonts.andP;  Font management is&quot;very simple,&quot; Cline said.andP;  &quot;You've got to have the same fonts on the Mac andon the PC.andP;  Right now there's no such thing as translation from Royal(TrueType) or LaserJet III to (Adobe PostScript) Type 1.&quot; Since PCs and Macshandle fonts differently, for a successful transfer, using a font that existsfor both platforms is your best bet.andM;For some users, though, font compatibility is not an issue.andP;  They considerfont display to be part of the graphics capabilities of the Mac and use PCsfor text processing only.andP;  Converting files to plain text before the transferhas the advantage of simplicity.andP;  But this shortcut has one drawback thatwill be obvious to anyone who uses it: PC text files include &quot;line-feed&quot;codes that show up as odd, useless characters on the Mac.andP;  These can beremoved by most word processors and several utilities, but this requires anextra step.andM;Text and graphics can be sent from one platform to another and arrivereasonably intact if the files are saved in a standard format that both Macsand PCs can read.andP;  For text, RTF is a good choice.andP;  The format is supportedby many programs, including Microsoft Word and PageMaker.andP;  As a rule ofthumb, bit-mapped graphics files should be saved as TIFF files andobject-oriented images saved as Encapsulated PostScript files before thetransfer.andM;The right connection.andP;  Users whose applications don't allow files to be savedin standard formats can hook up a cable between the PC and Mac and usedata-translation utilities, such as MacLinkPlus/PC from DataViz Inc. ofTrumbull, Conn.; QuickShare from Seattle-based SeeColor Corp.; or LapLink MacRelease III from Traveling Software Inc. of Bothell, Wash.andM;MacLinkPlus/PC can be used on its own to translate PC files to the Mac andvice versa, but the package also includes MacLinkPlus/Translators, a set ofword processing format converters that can be seamlessly blended intoprograms such as Claris Corp.'s MacWrite II 1.1.andP;  MacLinkPlus/PC cantranslate several popular PC graphics formats (including those used inHarvard Graphics, Lotus Freelance and Ventura Publisher) into Mac PICTformat.andP;  The utility can move graphics from Mac PICT files into PC Paintbrushformat as well.andM;QuickShare, which uses SCSI expansion boards to send files withouttranslation, can strip those obnoxious line-feed characters from text filessent from PC to Mac or put them in for files sent the other way.andP;  LapLink Macuses a high-speed serial connection to send and convert word processingfiles, but it can't translate graphics directly.andM;Translation utilities are especially useful at sites with too few machines tojustify a LAN.andP;  At Maxtor Corp., a hard disk drive manufacturer in San Jose,Calif., LapLink Mac transfers files between a Mac IIcx and a 80286-based PCclone &quot;a lot faster than the other methods we tried, like uploading anddownloading from a host and [sending the files] via modem,&quot; said Katie Voth,operations analyst for materials at Maxtor.andP;  Plain-text files are translatedinto Microsoft Word on the PC.andP;  Then they are transferred to the Mac, usingLapLink, and opened in Word there.andM;Wesley Wong, president of Magicmation Inc., a Seattle service bureau, foundQuickShare was &quot;the most efficient way of moving megabytes of data&quot; ingraphics files.andP;  To provide customers with comps of their artwork, Wong scans35mm slides into Adobe Photoshop on a Mac IIcx for touching up, saves filesin the PC TARGA format and sends them via QuickShare to SeeColor's ColorArchitect application running on a '386-based PC clone for overall colorcorrection.andP;  Wong uses Color Architect because it is &quot;a little bit easier touse than what's available for the Mac,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It would be easier if theideal [applications] were available all in one big box, but this is the realworld.&quot;andM;Sitka Corp. (formerly TOPS) of Alameda, Calif., provides data translation forsome formats along with its file-sharing software.andP;  The Sitka Network Bundlefor Macintosh 3.0 contains MacLinkPlus/Translators for transferring wordprocessing and graphics files between Macs and PCs on an AppleTalk network.andO;But some mixed-network users have had trouble getting Sitka's Network Bundleto run with Microsoft Windows/386.andP;  Because of the way that version ofWindows recognizes memory, running it and the network software at the sametime will result in a false out of memory message.andM;(BootCon from Pasadena, Calif.-based Modular Software Systems provides awork-around.andP;  BootCon lets users run two conflicting programs by rebootingand selecting the preferred configuration from a Windows menu.)andM;When the network is near.andP;  When everything's set up correctly, the easiestway to transfer a file between a Mac and a PC is to connect both machines toa shared file server over a network.andP;  Putting a LocalTalk board in the PC andrunning AppleShare or Sitka file-server software is a simple route to thisconnection.andP;  The speed of the LocalTalk network is the same in both cases,but Sitka's software is more cost-effective for small workgroups because youdon't have to dedicate a Mac as a file server.andM;Many mixed networks are set up to give PCs access to laser printers.andP;  Onesuch network, at the San Francisco Police Department, runs Sitka'sfile-sharing software over twisted-pair wiring, connecting 15 Macs with 15PCs, some of which were confiscated from drug raids and other criminalinvestigations (when the owners couldn't be identified).andM;&quot;We established the PC as the [department] standard, but we do all ourdesktop publishing on the Mac,&quot; said Ron Kramer, who set up the network astelecommunications administrator for the SFPD.andP;  The department mainly usesWordPerfect and PageMaker for publishing annual reports, posters and othermaterials.andP;  Since the programs are available for both platforms, filesrequire no translation, Kramer said.andM;An AppleShare or Sitka network is fine if you want a &quot;dirt-cheap network,&quot;Seybold's Cline said.andP;  But he added that &quot;industrial-strength&quot; networks from3Com Corp. and Novell Inc. are appropriate for serious graphics work.andP;  &quot;Ifsomebody's doing professional publishing, they'll want a server-basedsystem,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;They [also] need E-mail, dynamic backup, routing toexternal sites and dial-in access.andP;  You don't get all that as part of a[Sitka] or AppleShare network&quot;.andP;  Products providing these features can bepurchased separately for Sitka or AppleShare networks, however.andM;Low-cost networks pose another problem: The 230-Kbps LocalTalk speed is tooslow to handle large graphics files.andP;  Ethernet ups the 10-Mbps limit, but itdoesn't come cheap and, in practice, it never reaches its theoretical topspeed.andP;  Choosing a graphics network must depend on how much speed you needand how much you are willing to pay for it.andP;  Since even Ethernet can getbogged down on high-resolution graphics files, Cline recommendshigh-performance 32-bit Ethernet cards for all machines that handle largefiles.andP;  But high-resolution images should be kept off the network as much aspossible, Cline said.andM;&quot;You could have one main workstation [connected directly to the outputdevice] that will handle image manipulation, and everyone else will work witha low-resolution copy of the file,&quot; he said.andP;  This setup is favored byservice bureaus that keep high-resolution pages designed in Visionary (aversion of QuarkXPress) on a Macintosh connected to a Scitex system.andM;Serious graphics work requires memory at the workstation as well as a speedynetwork.andP;  &quot;If people are dealing with large-scale graphics files, especiallycolor, we recommend a [Mac II]ci or fx with 8 Mbytes of memory,&quot; Cline said.andO;On the PC side, he advises a '386-based machine with a VGA card, not lessthan 4 Mbytes of memory and an 80-Mbyte hard disk.andM;As more mixed sites become networked, problems with cross-platform filetransfer will become more common.andP;  The more users can standardize theprocess, such as by using PC and Macintosh versions of the same applications,the more success they are likely to have.andM;A good general strategy for network design that graphics departments andshops are finding useful is to configure the total network to keep traffic aslocalized as possible.andP;  One such network is used to produce catalogs forPittsburgh-based Black Box Corp., which manufactures computer equipment.andP;  Thepublishing department's Ethernet network was recently reconfigured to giveeach of the three catalog workgroups its own Mac IIfx or VAX file server.andO;The catalog currently being worked on by each group is stored on that group'sserver.andP;  In addition, a VAX serves as an archive of past catalogs.andP;  AMacintosh II with multiple Ethernet cards running Apple's Internet Routersoftware keeps traffic within the confines of each group's network.andM;The publishing department is now so much more efficient that it has begunsupplementing its in-house production schedule with contract work producingcatalogs for outside clients, said Dave Lokes, coordinator of publishingsystems for Black Box.andM;Some of the company's writers use WordStar 5 on IBM PC compatibles to writecatalog text, Lokes said.andP;  WordStar documents are then saved as plain textfiles and transferred to the Macs via a 80386-based Compaq server runningNovell Inc.'s NetWare 2.15 Professional.andP;  The catalogs are produced on 34Macs running Visionary, a modified version of QuarkXPress that allows usersto design pages that can be translated directly into a Scitex system, wherecolor retouching work is done (see sample catalog screen, Page XX).andM;But the PCs are being phased out.andP;  One reason is the NetWare server.andO;&quot;[Macintosh IIfx machines running AppleShare] are the most trouble-freeservers we've got,&quot; Lokes said.andP;  &quot;You have to be something between a brainsurgeon and a rocket scientist to understand NetWare,&quot; he said, adding thatthe writers who use Macintoshes are more efficient, since they can enter textdirectly into a page in Visionary.andP;  &quot;Some writers are slow to change [fromPCs to Macintoshes], but once they do, they are much more productive,&quot; hesaid.andP;  -- By Sarah Vandershaf</TEXT></DOC>
