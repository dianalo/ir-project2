The Census Bureau has just finished its 10-year national head count, and officials there are worried. The bureau has run the most expensive, well-publicized census operation in history. It has mailed more than 100 million census forms and knocked on millions of house and apartment doors. But as in past censuses, bureau officials know that several million Americans somehow eluded the enumerators and went uncounted.    Now here's the rub. The bureau thinks it can figure out how many people it missed, and even where these people live. By cross-referencing all sorts of records, and double-checking national censuses with small-scale post-census surveys, bureau officials think they can estimate, with a high degree of accuracy, the extent of the national undercount.    What's more, government demographers assume they can come up with accurate totals of people the census missed at the state, county and city level. If the formula is really humming, they say it may be possible to produce accurate undercount figures down to the individual city block.    With the statistical theory at hand and a mandate to produce the most accurate population picture possible, Census officials wonder if they should take the unprecedented step of adjusting the 1990 census totals to reflect these unenumerated Americans.    WHICH LEADS to a highly charged question: Should the nation's official decennial population count -- the benchmark for reapportioning the House of Representatives and state legislatures, the yardstick for handing out billions of dollars in federal aid, the statistical standard for marketing everything from political candidates to breakfast cereal -- include people that the Census Bureau didn't actually count but that the bureau assumes exist?    The &quot;adjustment&quot; question is increasingly a hot issue, spreading beyond the rarefied discussion of demographers to city halls, to the White House, and to Capitol Hill. New York and California are squaring off against smaller states over the issue. Mayors of several big cities, with government aid and possibly representation in Congress and in legislatures hanging in the balance, say they'll call in the lawyers if adjustment doesn't go through.    The debate widened last week in Indianapolis at the annual meeting of the National Conference of State Legislatures.    &quot;What happens if Indiana loses a congressional seat to California based on the modified figures?&quot; asked Thomas Hofeller, director of computer services for the Republican National Committee. &quot;Imagine the public reaction that fictitious people have been added to units of political geography when there isn't one shred of tangible evidence that those people actually live there.&quot;    Mr. Hofeller predicted pressure, if the census is adjusted, to also make public the traditional, unadjusted totals. Two sets of population figures floating around would confuse nearly everyone, he said, and could injure the Census Bureau's reputation.    REPUBLICANS, as it happens, would suffer the most political damage from an adjusted census. That's because blacks and Hispanics, who tend to vote Democratic, make up most of the undercount. In 1980, the Census Bureau believes it failed to physically find about 5.6% of the nation's black citizens, at least the same share of Hispanics, and 0.5% of all whites.    That makes adjustment a civil rights question, argued TerriAnn Lowenthal, staff director of a House of Representatives census subcommittee. &quot;These people aren't being fairly represented in Congress under one man, one vote,&quot; she told the legislators.    Ms. Lowenthal argued, and Census officials agree, that you can't find everyone simply by throwing more money and effort into the initial head count. Some people will always escape the census taker. Adjustment is &quot;a little scary,&quot; Ms. Lowenthal conceded, adding: &quot;We can keep on knowing that people aren't being fairly represented in Congress, or we can try to do something about it.&quot;    THE CENSUS BUREAU is squarely in the middle -- a nonpartisan agency attempting to subtly promote an idea with major political overtones.    The bureau says the issue is speed. The national census will be held in April 1990. Congress requires the bureau to deliver state population totals to the president by Dec. 31. Between those dates, the bureau would have to add up the national numbers, run a post-enumeration survey to determine the undercount, then adjust the totals nationwide, an immensely complex statistical task.    &quot;We think we have the technique. We don't know if we can do it fast enough in the field,&quot; C. Louis Kincannon, Census Bureau deputy director, told the legislators.    For now, the bureau is trying to educate politicians and others with a stake in adjustment. Mr. Kincannon says a go, no-go decision won't come until mid-1990.    Meanwhile, political pressure builds. The Reagan administration is hinting its displeasure. &quot;We're concerned about the position the bureau is in,&quot; says William Margaritis, a Commerce Department special assistant. Ms. Lowenthal says a bill ordering adjustment will likely be introduced in Congress next year.    Then there's the courts. Fifty-two lawsuits followed the 1980 census. Half are still pending, including a complaint challenging the accuracy of the unadjusted census in New York.    Mr. Kincannon is resigned to a fight. &quot;Whatever we do about adjustment is going to result in litigation against us,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
