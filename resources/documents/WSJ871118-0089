The agreement follows a six-month tug-of-war over congressional efforts to force the Pentagon to adhere to the traditional interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty as it conducts tests of antimissile defense systems under the Strategic Defense Initiative. The administration favors a broader reading of the accord, which limits testing and development of anti-missile systems. It also objects to setting any precedent in which Congress dictates treaty interpretations to the executive branch.    Under the compromise, a House-Senate conference committee, consulting closely with the White House, stripped the arms-control language in the defense bill of any specific reference to the ABM Treaty. Instead, the panel approved new language limiting the SDI program, popularly known as &quot;Star Wars,&quot; to projects the Pentagon laid out in submitting its budget for the current fiscal year. At that time, the Pentagon only envisioned tests that would be acceptable under the traditional interpretation of the treaty.    The arrangement thus gave both sides a measure of victory. Congress managed to hold the SDI program to the traditional treaty interpretation -- at least through the current fiscal year. But the administration didn't give up on its efforts to switch to a more liberal version eventually, and it avoided establishing a precedent for Congress to issue treaty interpretations.    The lawmakers also dropped language requiring the Pentagon to adhere to limits on the number of nuclear warheads set by the 1979 SALT II treaty, which was never ratified and has expired. Instead, the bill would deny funds for overhauling the USS Andrew Jackson, a missile submarine. That would have the effect of keeping the U.S. within the SALT II limits for another year.    The conferees dropped provisions to limit nuclear tests, but they adopted an amendment to bar further tests of anti-satellite weapons. The administration conducted the first test of an anti-satellite weapon two years ago.    Although the accord on arms-control issues appears to end the threat of a presidential veto of the budget measure, this year's spending level for the military remains in limbo pending the outcome of broader budget negotiations under way between Congress and the Reagan administration.    The defense bill would authorize a military budget of $296 billion if the president agrees to increase federal revenues by $19 billion. Without new revenue, the defense budget would total $289 billion. Moreover, if the Gramm-Rudman automatic budget cuts take effect -- something the budget negotiators are seeking to avoid -- the defense budget could be chopped to as low as $271 billion.    All those potential spending levels fall far short of the $312 billion the Reagan administration requested last January for fiscal 1988, which began Oct. 1. And once inflation is taken into account, even the bill's highest defense-spending level would represent a slight decline from the fiscal 1987 budget of $289.6 billion. The bill thus would mark the third consecutive year in which defense spending has declined after inflation.    Having settled the dispute with the administration over the ABM Treaty, the lawmakers authorized spending as much as $3.9 billion for the SDI program, somewhat higher than earlier predictions.    Moreover, the bill would actually authorize more funds for several large Army programs than the administration requested. For instance, the measure calls for 720 General Dynamics Corp. M-1 tanks, regardless of the outcome of the overall budget talks. The Pentagon had sought only 600 of the tanks.    Under the $289 billion budget scenario, the bill would kill two aircraft programs -- Grumman Aerospace Corp.'s A-6 naval attack plane and the Harrier attack plane, produced by McDonnell Douglas Corp., Rolls-Royce Ltd. and British Aerospace. And regardless of the overall budget, the bill would kill the Aquila remotely piloted reconnaissance vehicle.    The Reagan administration's request for spending on both the Midgetman and MX nuclear missiles would be cut sharply under the bill, but the Trident submarine and its D-5 nuclear missiles would receive close to the amounts requested.    Research funds for the national aerospace plane, a supersonic aircraft known as the &quot;Orient Express,&quot; would be chopped from the requested $236 million to $190 million or $170 million, depending on the overall budget. </TEXT></DOC>
