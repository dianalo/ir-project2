Governing and opposition party lawmakers visited Chun'sbirthplace near the southern city of Hapchon as part of a probe ofalleged corruption involving Chun and his family.   The opposition says Chun ordered government officials toconstruct a large garden and decorations around the tomb.   The Korean news agency Yonhap said the lawmakers earlier visitedthe southern city of Kwangju to inspect a governor's residence.   They found that the government spent about $1.7 million totransform the governor's residence into a luxurious safe house forChun, Yonhap said.   Officials said the legislators, from a special assemblycommittee, also planned to inspect a luxury lakeside villa built byChun and now used by President Roh Tae-woo as a presidential summerhouse.   The opposition wants the former president, who left office inFebruary at the end of a seven-year term, to testify before theassembly about corruption under his administration. Roh's governingparty has opposed the idea.   Roh played a key role in helping Chun seize power with militarybacking in 1980. Roh won election in December when the oppositionfielded two presidential candidates.   Chun's younger brother, Chun Kyong-hwan, is on trial on chargesof embezzling millions of dollars.
