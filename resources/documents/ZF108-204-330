 With the debut of the VAX 9000, DEC announced that systems could beconfigured with multiple CI ports.andP;  It is load balancing software in VMS 5.4that will make it possible for both the VAX 9000-and VAX 6000-seriescomputers to actually use more than one port concurrently.andM;DEC has also provided initial support for MSCP-level load balancing across amixed-cluster environment.andM;DECdtm, meanwhile, will support Rdb, RMS and VAX DBMS, and is designed toensure that each update to a distributed database occurs as a singleall-or-nothing process, regardless of where the database resides.andM;In general, VMS version 5.4 rounds out DEC's overall transaction processingsupport with new versions of DECintact, ACMS, Rdb and VAX DBMS.andP;  DEC has alsoreleased its first tools for analyzing and building more efficient databaseenvironments.andM;Version 2.0 of DECintact, a transaction processing monitor similar to IBM'sCICS (Customer Information Control System) that is based on technology DECacquired from Advanced Systems Concepts of Hoboken, N.J., adds support forRdb and DECforms, DEC's presentation service for building user interfaces.andO;Version 3.2 of ACMS adds support for DECdtm and the new analysis tools forDEC's databases.andM;According to Robert Glorioso, vice president of DEC's information systemsbusiness segment, support for DECintact under Rdb and DEC-forms will clear upconfusion over DEC's strategic TP environment.andP;  &quot;All of our TP monitors anddatabases now support each other.andP;  It will be up to customers to decide,&quot;Glorioso said.andM;He added that DEC &quot;will soon provide CASE tools to help developers migrateCICS applications to a DECintact environment on the VAX.&quot;andM;Under version 4.0 of Rdb, DEC has added support for DECdtm, achieved C2-levelsecurity compliance for databases--required by the Department of Defense--andadded several SQL enhancements, including support for segmented string datatypes, date and time arithmetic, and SQL module language support for recorddefinitions found in DEC's CDD Plus CASE repository.andM;Version 4.2 of VAX DBMS brings DECdtm support and an enhanced databasestructuring utility that lets users reclaim space after deleting an itemwithin a record, thereby saving disk space.andM;In addition, DEC last week released version 1.2 of DEC-forms, which companyofficials said not only supports DECintact, but has been enhanced to reduceCPU requirements for forms processing by 40 percent.andP;  DEC-forms now replacesVAX FMS and VAX TDMS as the single architecture for forms generation.andM;The most welcome set of tools released last week for software developers,database administrators and data processing operations managers wereDECtrace, DEC Rdb-Expert and DEC scheduler, respectively.andM;DECtrace provides a mechanism for collecting and reporting event-based data,including performance information from applications and databases.andP;  It can beused for such purposes as tuning ACMS and DECintact applications and Rdb andVAX DBMS databases, as well as to benchmark 3GL applications and performAll-in-1 capacity planning and general applications logging.andM;The new release of Rdb contains calls to DECtrace that allow automaticcollection of performance data on all tables created by users.andM;DEC RdbExpert produces Rdb and VAX DBMS physical databases designed usingexpert system rules.andP;  It analyzes the database logical design, workloadinformation, data volume information and system environment, and uses thisanalysis as a basis for generating executable procedures for creating thephysical database design.andM;When DECtrace and Rdb-Expert are combined with Rdb or DBMS, they canvirtually automate the database administrator's task of maintaining anefficient database design.andM;DECscheduler is a scheduling application that automates the running ofrepetitive jobs with complete documentation and audit trails.andM;The base price for DECtrace is $3,427; DEC's Rdb-Expert is priced at $12,750.andO;Prices for DECscheduler range from $750 to $31,400, depending on the system.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
