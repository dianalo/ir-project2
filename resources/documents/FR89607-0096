The resulting quotient (the ``weighted number of shares'') isthen multiplied by the index multiplier for that class of market basketto determine the number of shares of that component stock that are deliverableupon settlement, subject to the requirement that any fractional amountis to be rounded to the nearest whole share. In determining the weightednumber of shares of a component stock (which number is to be rounded tofour decimal places), the number of shares outstanding is expressed inmillions of shares rounded to three decimal places and the index divisoris rounded to four decimal places.For example, if on the opening of business on a given trade date XYZ Corp.has 130.257 million shares outstanding and the index divisor for the Standardandamp; Poor's (``Sandamp;P'') 500 Stock Price Index market basket is 3022.4168,the weighted number of shares of XYZ stock will be 0.0431 (130.257andCx.1;3022.4168).The number of shares of XYZ stock deliverable upon settlement of an Sandamp;P500 market basket purchased in a trade on that day would be equal to theweighted number of shares (0.0431) multiplied by 5,000 (the index multiplierfor Sandamp;P 500 market baskets), or 216 shares (0.0431andmultiply;5,000=215.5)..02 For the purpose of settling the obligations resulting from the purchaseor sale of a market basket contract, the index divisor and the number ofshares outstanding of each of the component stocks shall be determinedby the Exchange based solely upon information provided to the Exchangeby the reporting authoriy as of the opening of business on the trade date.The Exchange's determination shall be final and conclusive.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">[Replaces Rules 5.6, 6.4 and 24.9]<ITAG tagnum="84">Meaning of Bids and Offers</ITAG>Rule 26.3 Bids and offers shall be expressed in terms of dollars and decimalsper unit of the index to two decimal places and shall be multiplied bythe index multiplier for the applicable contract to arrive at the totalamount of the bid or offer (<T3>e.g., </T3>a bid of 250.00 for a market basket having an index multiplierof 5,000 would represent a bid of $1,250,000 for that market basket).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">[Replaces Rules 6.41, 6.42 and 24.8]<ITAG tagnum="84">Disseminaton of Information</ITAG>Rule 26.4 (a) The Exchange shall disseminate or cause to be disseminatedafter the close of business and from time-to-time on days on which transactionsin market baskets are made on the Exchange: (i) the current index value;(ii) the price at which each transaction in market baskets has been effectedand the transaction volume at such price; and (iii) the prices at whichbids and offers are made on the floor of the Exchange.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change </ITAG>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization includedstatements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule changeand discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. Thetext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in ItemIV below and is set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and theStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change CBOE previously has filed with the Commission rules relating to the tradingof market basket contracts (File No. SR-CBOE-88-20). The purpose of thepresent filing is to restate and clarify the rules governing the tradingof market baskets. In essence, a market basket is a contract that it settled by the physicaldelivery of the stocks comprising a selected index (the ``component stocks''),with the individual stocks delivered in proportion to their weighting inthat index. Unlike the traditional options also traded on CBOE, marketbaskets will not have an exercise price or an expiration date. Instead,the buyer of a market basket will be obligated to purchase and the sellerwill be obligated to sell a specified quantity of shares of each of thecomponent stocks of a designated stock market index. Settlement of thepurchase and sale of the component stocks will take place on the fifthbusiness day after trade date in accordance with the rules of a correspondentstock clearing corporation.The rules relating specifically to market baskets will be set out in newChapter XXVI of CBOE Rules. Although market baskets are not options, theywill be treated as index options under CBOE Rules, so that the rules inChapters I through XIX (the general rules of the Exchange) as well as therules in Chapter XXIV (CBOE's index option rules) generally will be applicableto transactions in market baskets to the extent not supplemented or replacedby the rules in Chapter XXVI a description of the changes proposed to bemade to CBOE Rules is set forth below, together with a discussion of theregulatory treatment of certain aspects of market basket contract trading.A. Proposed Rule Changes Rule 26.1 sets forth certain definitions that are applicable specificallyto market baskets. The terms ``market basket'' and ``market basket contract''are defined to mean a contract obligating the seller to sell and the purchaserto purchase a designated number of each of the stocks included in the indexon which the market basket is based (the ``component stocks''). The ``indexmultiplier'' is defined to mean the amount specified in the market basketcontract as the index multiplier for that contract (<T3>see </T3>Rule 26.2). This differs from the definition of this termin Chapter XXIV and would be applicable solely to the market basket rulesin Chapter XXVI.Other terms_specifically, ``class'' and ``underlying security''_have beendefined to vary their meaning elsewhere in the rules of CBOE when thoseterms are used in the context of market basket contracts. In particular,``class'' is specially defined in Rule 26.1 to mean all market basket contractsbased on the same stock index. References in CBOE rules to a ``class''of index options will mean, in the case of market basket contracts, allsuch contracts that are based on the same stock index. The term ``underlyingsecurity'' similarly has been defined to mean the stocks comprising theindex on which the market basket is based (<T3>i.e., </T3>the component stocks). The terms of the market basket contracts are set forth in Rule 26.2 whichdescribes the quantity of component stocks that will be deliverable uponsettlement of a market basket contract. That rule provides that each ofthe component stocks is deliverable in an amount equal to that stock'sweighted number of shares in the index times the index multiplier (subjectto any rounding to the nearest whole share). The weighted number of sharesis determined by dividing the total number of shares oustanding (statedin millions of shares) by the divisor for that index. To illustrate, the index multiplier for the Standard andamp; Poor's (``Sandamp;P'')500 Stock Price Index market is 5,000. If XYZ Corp. has 130.257 millionsshares outstanding and if the divisor for the Sandamp;P 500 (expressed tofour decimal places) is 3022.4168, the weighted number of shares for XYZCorp. would be 0.0431 (130.257andCx.1;3022.4168). The purchaser of the Sandamp;P500 market basket would receive 216 shares (.0431andmultiply;5,000) of XYZstock, together with the stock of the other companies whose shares comprisethe index in amounts corresponding to their respective weightings in theindex (except to the extent that fractional shares are rounded to wholenumbers in accordance with Rule 26.2). In determining share weightings(and, correspondingly, the number of shares of each component stock thatis to be delivered), the number of shares outstanding is expressed in millionsand decimals thereof (<T3>e.g., </T3>130.257).As provided in Rule 26.2 the index multiplier for both Sandamp;P 100 andSandamp;P 500 market baskets is 5,000, resulting in single Sandamp;P 100 (OEB)and Sandamp;P 500 (SPB) market baskets covering stocks having a value ofapproximately $1,455,000 and $1,545,000, respectively, at present indexlevels. Rule 263, in turn, provides that bids and offers are to be multipliedby the index multiplier for the contract in question. Trading in market baskets ordinarily will be conducted between 8:30 a.m.and 3:15 p.m. Chicago time, and Rule 26.5 provides that it will be theresponsibility of an Order Book Official (``OBO'') to establish daily asingle opening price for each class of market baskets (<T3>i.e., </T3>the Sandamp;P 100 class and the Sandamp;P 500 class). CBOE Rule7.1 separately provides that the OBO, an Exchange employee, is responsible,among other things, for maintaining the limit order book and for displayingbids and offers in the book. As provided in Rules 7.7 and 7.8, the OBOis required continuously to display the highest bid and the lowest offerand the quantity at those prices and may disclose the price and numberof contracts bid below or offered above the best bid and offer. The OBOalso is authorized and directed to execute customer orders left on hisbook and, as provided in Rule 6.45, such bids and offers have priorityover bids and offers in the trading crowd at the same price except in thecircumstances specified therein. CBOE intends to cause these same proceduresto be applied to the trading of market baskets. Rules 26.6 and 26.7 provide that position limits and exercise limits willnot apply to market baskets since there will be no open interest in, andno exercise of, market basket contracts. Instead, all transactions in marketbaskets will be settled by the delivery of the component stocks. Thus,exercise limits have no application to market baskets and, for the samereasons that there are no numerical restrictions on the ownership of sharesof individual common stock, position limits should not apply. Rule 26.8 provides that delivery of the component stocks by the sellerof a market basket and payment therefor by the purchaser are to be in accordancewith the rules of The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') and the rulesof correspondent stock clearing corporations. OCC will be responsible forthe initial clearance and settlement of all trades in market basket contractseffected on CBOE, including the neeting of offsetting market basket tradesin the accounts of Market-Makers and the cash settlement of any differencesbetween the trade price and the prices at which purchases and sales ofthe component stocks are settled at correspondent stock clearing corporations.It is anticipated that OCC will require both sides to the trade to maintainmargin at a level adequate to cover the market risk of open positions duringthe interval between trade date and settlement date. (This will be addressedspecifically in the rule change filing that OCC will make in respect ofmarket basket contracts.) The actual settlement in all positions in stockresulting from the trading in market baskets will take place through correspondentstock clearing corporations, as currently is the case with the settlementof exercises of equity options, based upon information provided by OCC.CBOE has not adopted special rules for the margining of market baskets,but instead proposes that market baskets be margined in respect of thepositions in common stock that result from settlement of the market basketcontract. This reflects that persons trading in these contracts will nothave a position in ``market baskets'' as a separate security at the endof the trading day but will instead have an obligation to deliver or payfor and receive the component stocks on the settlement date. Rule 26.9accordingly specifies that the provisions of Chapter XII of CBOE Rules,which sets our margin requirements generally applicable to all marginsaccounts of customers, will be applicable to the long or short positionsin the component stocks resulting from the trading of market basket contracts.Among other things, Chapter XII incorporates the margin requirements ofRegulation T of the Federal Reserve Board (Rule 12.1), establishes maintenancemargin requirements for customers' securities positions held in marginaccounts (Rule 12.3), and prohibits customers from engaging in ``free riding,''the practice of satisfing margin requirements by the liquidation of positionsin the customer's account (Rule 12.9).Applying Regulation T to long and short stock positions resulting fromtransactions in market basket contracts generally will mean that purchasersof market baskets in margin accounts will be required initially to deposit50% margin in respect of each long stock position, and that sellers ofmarket baskets who are short the component stocks as a result of thosesales (that is, where the seller of the market basket does not own oneor more of the stocks in an amount sufficient to deliver on settlementof the contract) will be subject to the 150% margin requirement of RegulationT in respect of those stocks sold short. Market-makers would not be subjectto these general requirements. Instead, and as provided in Regulation T,a Market-Maker in market basket contracts would be entitled to ``good faith''margin treatment for all market baskets transactions in the same manneras any other specialist who makes a market in a particular security.The Exchange intends to apply substantially all of its customer protectionrules to market basket trading. In considering the subject of customerprotection, however, it is important to note that the unit of trading formarket baskets will cover stocks having a value of approximately $1.5 million,limiting interest in these contracts only to the largest and most sophisticatedinstitutional investors. These investors, who can be assumed to understandthe risks of buying and selling large blocks of stock in complex hedgeor arbitrage strategies, and who have the financial means to carry suchpositions and assume the related risk, do not require the same degree ofprotection in matters of customer protection (such as suitability) as doretail investors.Nevertheless, new Rule 26.10 provides that, with a small number of specificexceptions, Chapter IX of CBOE's rules (``Doing Business With the Public'')will apply to CBOE members in respect of their customer business in marketbaskets. For purposes of Chapter IX, market baskets will be deemed to beindex options, and therefore will be subject to the rules covering supervisionsuitability, restrictions on acting for persons affiliated with exchangesor other members, assuming losses, communications with customers and complaints.Since a completed trade in a market basket contract does not result inthe issuance of a separate security, but instead is settled by the deliveryof the component stocks, there will be no registration statement or prospectusissued under the Securities Act of 1933 and no disclosure document issuedor disseminated to customers in connection with market basket trading.Rule 26.10 accordingly provides that CBOE rules relating to those subjectsare not applicable to market baskets. CBOE, however, will prepare and makeavailable to its members a written description of the mechanics and risksof market basket trading and CBOE member organizations will be requiredto provide this document to their customers.CBOE Rule 9.11, relating to the confirmation of transactions to customerssimilarly will not be applicable to market baskets. In its place, Rule26.10 specifies that Exchange member organizations must provide in customerconfirmation statements details not only as to the market basket transactionitself, but also information identifying each of the component stocks deliverablein satisfaction of the obligations arising out of market basket trading.CBOE Rule 9.7(b) establishes special procedures that govern the openingof accounts for option customers, including a requirement that a RegisteredOptions Principal (``ROP'') approve the opening of the account. As providedin Rule 9.2, ROP's are required to complete a qualification examinationand must be approved by the Exchange. These additional qualifications areinapplicable to the trading of market baskets and also are not necessaryfor the protection of the customers that will be purchasers or sellersof market baskets. Rule 26.10 accordingly provides that accounts for customerswho wish to purchase or sell a market basket may be approved by the branchoffice manager or some other officer of the member organization.Like other contracts traded on CBOE, market baskets will be traded by competingMarket-Makers, who act as dealer-specialists in trading for thier own accounts(<T3>see </T3>Rule 8.1), and by floor brokers who represent customers' orderson an agency basis. Most of the Rules in Chapter VIII (``Market-Makersand Block Positioners'') will apply to trading in market basket contracts.For example, the rules relating to Market-Maker registration (Rule 8.2),Clearing Member letters of guarantee (Rule 8.5), restrictions on actingas a Market-Maker and floor broker (Rule 8.8), and reporting of transactionsin securities other than options (Rule 8.9) will apply these contracts.Other provisions of the Exchange's Market-Maker rules have been modifiedin their application to market baskets, however. Whereas a CBOE Market-Makerordinarily may trade in classes of options to which his appointment underRule 8.3 does not extend as long as such trading is not in delegation ofhis obligations in his appointed classes (as provided in Rule 8.7), Rule26.11(a) provides that Exchange members will not be permitted to act asMarket-Makers in market basket contracts absent an appointment by the Exchangefor that class of market basket contract. An Exchange member that is notso appointed remains free to execute customer orders as a floor broker,however. Rule 26.11(b) separately authorizes the establishment of minimumfinancial requirements, in addition to the Clearing Member guarantee setforth in Rule 8.5, for Market-Makers that wish to trade in market basketcontracts.The responsibilities of a Market-Maker in market baskets parallel the provisionsof existing Rule 8.7. As set forth in new Rule 26.11(c), a Market-Makerwould be expected to engage, to a reasonable degree under the existingcircumstances, in dealings for his own account when there exists, or itis reasonably anticipated that there will exist, a lack of price continuity,a temporary disparity between the supply of and demand for that class ofmarket baskets, or a temporary distortion of the price relationships betweenmarket baskets of the same class. This is essentially the same standardas applies to all CBOE Market-Makers. More particularly, Market-Makersin these contracts will be expected to compete with other Market-Makersto improve the markets in each class of market basket contracts for whichthe Market-Maker has been appointed at the station where the Market-Makeris present. In addition, Market-Makers will be expected to make markets,at the request of another member or the Order Book Official, by providingbids and/or offer quotations that are subject to immediate acceptance forone contract. This standard, which differs from the five-contract requirementof Rule 8.7.05, is based upon the size of each market basket contract.Finally, and as with other contracts traded on the Exchange, Market-Makerswould be expected to update market quotations in response to changed marketconditions at the station where the Market-Maker is present.B. Antimanipulative Rules(i) <T3>Rule 10a-1. </T3>CBOE does not believe that the short sale rule (SecuritiesExchange Act Rule 10a-1) should apply to transactions in market basketcontracts. It is readily apparent that a trading market in market basketscould not function if sales of such contracts were subject to the shortsale rule. CBOE believes that sales of market baskets should be exemptedfrom the short sale rule, however, essentially because the reasons forthe rule do not require it to be applied to market baskets. The fundamentalpurposes of the short sale rule are to prevent speculative selling fromaccelerating a decline in the price of equity securities and to prevent``bear raiding'' (a form of manipulation). It is virtually inconceivable,however, that any person would seek to sell all of the stocks underlyinga broad-based index such as the Sandamp;P 100 or the Sandamp;P 500 merely toaffect the price of a single stock. Thus, no valid regulatory purpose wouldbe served by causing transactions in market baskets, involving 100 or 500stocks, to be subject to the provisions of a rule that is designed to preventmanipulative practices from affecting the price of individual stocks.The ``tick test'' incorporated by the short sale rule also cannot be reasonablyapplied to market baskets. A tick test based upon the prices of all thecomponent stocks is obviously unworkable because it is unrealistic to expectthat the last reported sales in all of the stocks underlying a market basketwill ever be on a plus tick or a zero-plus tick at any one time. Sincethere always will be sellers of market baskets who do not own all of thecomponent stocks, application of the tick test to the 100 or 500 componentstocks would adversely affect the liquidity of a market basket contract.Although a tick test conceivably could be based upon the prices at whichthe baskets themselves trade (<T3>i.e.</T3>, without regard to the prices of their component stocks),this approach fails to take into account the anticipated discontinuityin market basket trading. Specifically, CBOE expects that the extraordinarysize of market basket trades (approximately $1.5 million/contract) willresult in no more than a small number of these trades being executed eachday. As a result, a trade in market baskets could be made at a price thatrepresents a minus or zero-minus tick from the preceding basket price ata time when the underlying stock market is rising. In effect, therefore,short sales would be prohibited under the rule, even in a rising market,until the last basket sale price could be bettered.Application of the tick test to the market baskets themselves also couldeffectively preclude short sales of market baskets during a declining market_preciselythe time when the ``shock absorbing'' benefits of market basket tradingwould be most useful. To deny institutions, broker-dealers, and arbitrageursthe ability to sell market baskets when the market is falling (unless theyown and intend to deliver all 100 or 500 stocks) would leave those traderswith the same unsatisfactory alternatives as presently exist, includingtrading in stock index futures which are not subject to any type of shortsale restrictions.(ii) <T3>Rules Adopted under Section 10(b). </T3>In considering the applicationto market basket trading of the various antimanipulative rules adoptedunder Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``ExchangeAct''), it is important to keep in mind that a market basket contract issimply a mechanism for trading in stocks and is not itself a separate security.Purchasers and sellers of a market basket contract are, in effect, purchasersand sellers of the stocks that comprise the index on which the basket isbased. Market basket transactions result in long or short positions inthe component stocks, and do not result in any continuing or open positionsin the baskets themselves. Thus, most of the antimanipulative rules adoptedunder Section 10(b) will apply to transactions and positions in stockseffected through market basket trades to the same extent as those issuedthrough ordinary stock trades.Specifically, Rules 10b-2, 10b-3, 10b-5, 10b-6, 10b-7, 10b-8, 10b-13, 10b-16,10b-18 and 10b-21(T) all would appear to apply to transactions in stockseffected through market basket contracts, even though, as discussed below,it may ultimately prove necessary to exempt market basket transactionsfrom certain of these rules. Rules 10b-9 and 10b-17 would appear to haveno application to market basket transactions.Rule 10b-4, which addresses the practice of ``short tendering'' of securities,likewise should present no problem in its application to market baskettrading, since a market basket contract represents, in the words of therule, ``an unconditional contract, binding on both parties thereto,'' topurchase or sell each of the stocks included in the contract. Thus, a purchaserof a market basket contract should be deemed to own each of the componentstocks for purposes of Rule 10b-4, and a person's net long position instocks should be reduced by the number of shares deliverable pursuant toany market basket contract that the person has sold.Rule 10b-10, dealing with confirmations to customers, would apply to confirmationsof market basket transactions as described above in the discussion of proposedCBOE Rule 26.10.It is possible that after there has been some experience with trading inmarket basket contracts, there may appear to be a need for exemptive relieffrom certain of the foregoing rules. For example, it may appear that rulessuch as Rule 10b-6, 10b-7 or 10b-13, each of which restricts transactionsin securities under certain conditions, ought not to apply to restrictthe purchase or sale of individual securities that occur in the contextof a transaction in a broadly based, block-size market basket contract.To the extent that any such exemptions prove to be desirable, they willbe the subject of appropriate written requests.C. Other Regulatory Matters(i) <T3>Location of Trading Post.</T3> CBOE contemplates that market basketswill be traded adjacent to the post or posts at which traditional indexoptions are traded. The Exchange believes that this arrangement will enhancethe efficiency of both markets by minimizing price disparities betweenmarket baskets and index options and facilitating hedging and other tradingstrategies involving both types of index contract. This arrangement shouldnot present any of the potential abuses at which restrictions against certainforms of side-by-side trading are directed, since both market baskets andthe related index options are priced derivatively in relation to the pricesof component or underlying stocks in the principal markets in which suchstocks are traded.(ii) <T3>``Front-Running.''</T3> CBOE has from time to time issued educationalcirculars for the purpose of informing the membership of CBOE policy withrespect to certain matters arising under the rules of Exchange. To thisend, the Exchange has issued Educational Circular No. 23 which presentsthe Exchange's enforcement policy with respect to certain practices generallyknown as ``front-running.'' That Circular has been revised twice sinceits issuance in 1978, most recently in February 1986. The most recent versionof that Circular makes clear CBOE's position that a person engaging infront-running (as defined) involving index options violates CBOE Rule 4.1(``Just and Equitable Principles of Trade''). CBOE will make clear in announcementsto its membership that existing prohibitions against front-running applyto market baskets and, if necessary, will further amend Educational CircularNo. 23 to address trading in market baskets.(iii) <T3>Last Sale and Quotation Reports.</T3> Since CBOE proposes to tradestocks only in the context of market basket contracts and not individually,the last sale and quotation information to be made available for marketbaskets will be limited to the price at which the basket last traded, thesize of the trade, and the current bid and offer for the basket. Last saleand quotation information will not be reported separately for each stock.To do otherwise would require ``exploding'' a basket trade or quote amongthe component stocks pursuant to an arbitrary allocation formula, whichwould not present an accurate picture of the market in these stocks.Reflecting the derivative nature of bids and offers in market baskets,bids and offers for market baskets should not be subject to Exchange ActRule 11Ac1-1 (govering securities quotations) for the same reason thatput and call options traded on CBOE have never been subject to that Rule.A market basket bid or offer quotation necessarily depends upon the latestquotations in all of the component stocks of the basket and is subjectto change whenever quotations in any of these stocks change. In such circumstances,if would be inappropriate to require a Market-Maker's bid or offer to remainfirm for any stated period of time, during which the prices of the componentstocks may have changed. As is the case for options, bids and offers formarket baskets will be firm when made (<T3>i.e.,</T3> bids and offers will be subject to immediate acceptanceup to the quantity stated in the bid or offer) and the dissemination ofthese bids and offers will present an accurate and meaningful indicationof the state of the market at that time.The last sale and quotation reports for baskets will be disseminated ona current basis over the system of the Options Price Reporting Authority.CBOE also intends to make appropriate arrangements for the disseminationof total end-of-day volume in the market baskets and in each of the componentstocks as a result of market basket trading.(iv) <T3>Exemption of Component Stocks from Section 12(a) of Exchange Act.</T3>Insofar as the trading of market basket contracts on CBOE may be viewedas encompassing the exchange trading of the component stocks of the basket,the individual component stocks should be exempted from Section 12(a) ofthe Exchange Act in order to eliminate the need to list the component stockson CBOE or to apply for unlisted trading privileges in the component stocks.Such an exemption would be comparable to the exemption for stocks underlyinglisted options provided for in Exchange Act Rule 12a-6, and would be basedupon considerations similar to those that supported the adoption of thatRule. A similar exemption has recently been extended to the stocks underlyingindex participations proposed to be traded on CBOE and other exchanges.(<T3>See</T3> Exchange Act Release No. 34-26709 (April 11, 1989)). As isthe case with stocks underlying options and index participations, componentstocks of market basket contracts may be thought of as traded on CBOE onlyin the most narrow sense, since component stocks will be traded only aspart of a basket of at least 100 stocks, and will not be traded individually.Each of the component stocks will be listed on one or more other nationalsecurities exchanges or will be traded on the NASDAQ system, and thereforewill be registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act by virtue of suchlisting or trading. No benefit to investors would result from requiringthe additional registration of such component stocks for CBOE. On the otherhand, if registration were required, as a practical matter CBOE would haveto be extended unlisted trading privileges (``UTP'') in each present andfuture component stock.In order to avoid the need for a blanket UTP application, CBOE believesthe better approach would be for the Commission to amend Rule 12a-6 forthe purpose of exempting from Section 12(a) those stocks that are tradedon a national securities exchange only as component stocks of a marketbasket contract.(iv) <T3>Net Capital.</T3> Broker-dealers taking positions in market basketswill, at the end of the trading day, be long or short the component stocksas a result of these basket transactions. The Exchange anticipates thatthe resulting position in stocks will be subject to the normal ``haircuts''set out in paragraphs (c)(2)(vi)(J) and (f)(3)(ii) of the Commission'snet capital rule (Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1). CBOE further anticipates thatpositions in the component stocks resulting from the trading of marketbaskets will be subject to lesser haircuts where those positions are offsetby broad-based index options or futures contracts, consistent with positionstaken previously by staff of the Commission.The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section6(b) of the Exchange Act in general, and furthers the objectives of Section6(b)(5) in particular, in that the proposed rule change is intended toprevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, remove impedimentsto and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, and protect investorsand the public interest.(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on CompetitionThis proposed rule change will not impose a burden on competition.(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the ProposedRule Change Received from Members, Participants or OthersComments were neither solicited nor received.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.
