President Zia and U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel died when the Pakistani leader's C-130 transport plane exploded in midair in eastern Pakistan shortly after takeoff. U.S. officials said privately that the plane appeared to have been hit by a missile or a bomb may have been planted on board, but they said that they would withhold judgment until more information is available.    The crash also claimed the lives of Pakistani Chief of Staff Rahman Akhtar -- the architect of Pakistan's support for Afghan insurgents -- several other Pakistani generals and the head of the U.S. Embassy's military mission, U.S. Brig. Gen. Herbert M. Wassom. They were returning to Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, after viewing a demonstration of the U.S. M-1 tank, which Pakistan is considering buying.    &quot;This is a severe blow for Pakistan and the U.S.,&quot; said Sen. Gordon Humphrey, (R., N.H.), voicing a view widely held in official Washington. &quot;We don't have a more courageous ally anywhere in the world.&quot;    Sen. Humphrey met many times with President Zia, Washington's most vital ally in the region since the fall of Iran's shah. Citing the Pakistani leader's resistance to pressures from the Soviets and from some of his domestic political opponents to abandon the Afghan insurgents, the U.S. lawmaker said: &quot;If it weren't for Zia, Afghanistan would now be part of the Soviet empire.&quot;    In California, President Reagan rushed to signal continued U.S. support for Pakistan, while administration officials sought to determine whether the apparent attack was an isolated incident or could be the first in an orchestrated string of assaults on U.S. interests in the region. &quot;The U.S. was fortunate to have such a friend in President Zia, but our support for Pakistan is not dependent on any individual,&quot; Mr. Reagan said. &quot;Our strong support for the people of Pakistan and their security and territorial integrity will continue.&quot;    As provided by the Pakistani constitution, the seasoned chairman of the Senate, Ghulam Ishaq Khan, took over as caretaker president. A senior Reagan administration official said the short-term danger to Pakistani stability probably would be small because of an immediate closing of ranks around the country's interim president. But U.S. officials fear a greater danger of disruptions later this year if the country's new leadership seeks to delay elections, scheduled for Nov. 16, that President Zia had promised, or if it stands by current rules prohibiting involvement of political parties in the campaigns.    Acting President Ishaq Khan assured Pakistanis that the November elections would proceed, despite President Zia's death. &quot;We will continue to march on the glowing path of democracy with full determination and confidence, God willing,&quot; he said in an address to the nation. &quot;God willing, the elections will be held 16 November as scheduled.&quot;    &quot;For the short run, things will be orderly,&quot; said Stephen P. Cohen, a former State Department official now at the University of Illinois. &quot;But in the long run, you could have public disturbances that could activate the military's concerns. The problems come if Pakistanis can't agree on the rules of the game.&quot;    Pakistani officials said it wasn't yet possible to determine the cause of the crash, which occurred in a remote corner of Pakistan. But a senior Reagan administration official said, &quot;We seriously suspect foul play.&quot; He said that the plane exploded 10 minutes after takeoff, and that intelligence officials say the first indications suggest a bomb or anti-aircraft missile was responsible.    Although there were reports from Pakistan that Mr. Zia's plane might have collided with a helicopter, a senior Reagan administration official said information he had received ruled out that possibility.    &quot;There are the Indians, tribal groups who don't like Zia's crackdown on drugs, separatist movements, the KGB and the Khad {the Afghan KGB}, all of whom have an interest in his death,&quot; the U.S. official said.    A Pentagon official also noted that the incident came after a steady escalation of Soviet threats toward Pakistan. Moscow complains that Pakistan is continuing to allow its territory to be used as a conduit for weapons to the Afghan resistance in violation of this year's Geneva accords to end the war in Afghanistan. As guarantor of the agreements, Soviet officials have asserted that they have the right to enforce adherence.    The Soviet news agency Tass said early this month that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze delivered Pakistani Foreign Minister Yaqub Khan the following message: &quot;We would wish they in Islamabad become clearly aware this cannot go on indefinitely . . . . The Soviet Union and the Republic of Afghanistan will find ways to counter the growing interference in the internal affairs of the Republic of Afghanistan.&quot;    The Soviet news media reported the death of President Zia, who had accused Moscow of supporting terrorism against his country, without comment. Tass cited foreign reports instead of using its own correspondent in Islamabad. Moscow radio broadcast the report as the seventh item on its evening newscast following domestic items, including a harvest report.    Whatever the cause of the crash, it strikes Pakistan at a particularly delicate time, both for it and the U.S.    The Soviets are halfway through their scheduled withdrawal of their 115,000 troops from Afghanistan, and anti-Soviet insurgents need continued Pakistani assistance in arms deliveries to dislodge Moscow's puppet regime from the country's major cities.    Political conditions also are unsettled in Pakistan. President Zia dissolved the National Assembly and dismissed Prime Minister Mohammed Khan Junejo May 29, citing a breakdown of law and order and the slow pace of Islamic reforms. He announced nationwide elections would be held, but he angered the opposition by declaring the vote would be held on a nonparty basis. He also scheduled the elections to coincide with the final weeks of pregnancy of his chief rival, Benazir Bhutto, the daughter of former Pakistani President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, whom President Zia deposed and had executed.    For the U.S., the pre-election period is an awkward time for a potential confrontation with the Soviets over Pakistan or Afghanistan. Vice President George Bush is arguing in his presidential campaign that because the Reagan administration has dealt from a position of strength, relations are better with the Soviets than at any time since World War II. The Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan is one of the major foreign policy triumphs of the Reagan presidency.    From the very beginning of the Afghan war, it was President Zia's willingness to stand up to the Soviets and his own domestic opposition that allowed the Afghan rebels to continue fighting and three million Afghan refugees to live on Pakistani land. U.S. officials say his personal support enabled the Reagan administration to ship Stinger anti-aircraft missiles through Pakistan to the Afghan resistance starting in August 1986 -- a strategic move that was a major turning point in the fighting.    &quot;That was a decision that couldn't have been made without Zia's personal commitment,&quot; said Stephen Sestanovich, director of Soviet studies at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.    In an interview earlier this year with The Wall Street Journal, President Zia spoke of the Afghan war as his personal, Islamic cause and said he would stand up to any Soviet efforts to intimidate him.    &quot;Perhaps Pakistan will have to pay a little more price until the Mujahedeen {Moslem resistance} achieve their aims in Afghanistan,&quot; he said. He vowed that Pakistan &quot;will pay the price,&quot; which he said would be &quot;arm-twisting, border bombing and other things.&quot;    U.S. officials don't believe the Afghan resistance faces any immediate military threat; it has a large stockpile of weapons that will grow every time it captures a regime post. Any problems caused for it by President Zia's death will come later. Whoever succeeds President Zia will be more preoccupied with domestic problems, and will be less capable of backing Afghan rebels, particularly given increased resentment by Pakistanis of what they perceive as a drain on their economy caused by the continued presence of Afghan refugees.    All this comes at a time when the Afghan regime's army is performing better than expected. &quot;It is becoming increasingly clear that Soviet assessments are true that the Afghan regime isn't a house of cards that will collapse instantly,&quot; said Dimitri Simes, a specialist on Soviet affairs at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. &quot;It could hold onto major cities for a considerable period of time.&quot;    Meanwhile, some experts believe President Zia's death could allow long-festering domestic problems in Pakistan to surface. They believe the domestic strains of the Afghan war, demands for full transfer to civilian government and pressures from separatist movements all could grow without the strong central figure of President Zia.    &quot;Too many things have been bottled up for too long,&quot; said Shireen Hunter of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. &quot;The chances you have of someone emerging with Zia's characteristics, who can control all of this, aren't very much.&quot;    Still, U.S. officials don't believe the Pakistani military -- whose role President Zia gradually has reduced -- will try to seize power unless the country sinks into political chaos.    A State Department spokesman announced the U.S. is sending a plane from West Germany to Islamabad to pick up the bodies of the two Americans and return them to the U.S. A state memorial service for President Zia will be on Saturday. It hasn't yet been determined who will lead the U.S. delegation.    ---                      Pakistan in Brief    Population (1988 est.)               103 million    GNP (1987)                           $33.36 billion    Per capita income (1987)             $331    Religion                             97% Moslem    U.S. economic aide      Actual (1982-1987)                 $ 1.62 billion      Approved (1988-1993)               $ 2.25 billion    U.S. military aid      Actual (1982-1987)                 $ 1.50 billion      Approved (1988-1993)               $ 1.74 billion                  Chronology of Zia's Rule    July 1977   Gen. Zia ousts President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in a military coup and imposes a martial-law government with himself as administrator. Mr. Bhutto, convicted of ordering a political murder while in office, is hanged in April 1979 after President Zia refuses to commute the death sentence. Mr. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party remains the country's most powerful political group, and is now headed by his daughter, Benazir.    December 1979   The Soviet invasion of neighboring Afghanistan causes the U.S. to patch up its testy relations with Pakistan. Pakistan becomes a major recipient of U.S. military aid and the main conduit for U.S. weapons going to the Moslem guerrillas whose resistance inside Afghanistan helped persuade Moscow to begin pulling its troops out. Some three million Afghan refugees are now in Pakistan.    December 1985   President Zia lifts martial law and allows political parties to function for the first time since 1979. But the constitution is amended, giving sweeping power to his presidential office. Organized political parties had been barred from participating in elections held under the Zia regime, including a 1984 referendum that extended Mr. Zia's rule until March 1990.    May 29, 1988   President Zia dissolves Parliament, dismissing Prime Minister Mohammed Khan Junejo, who he had named in 1985 as head of a power-sharing civilian government, and orders general elections, later scheduled for Nov. 16. But his death yesterday throws the election into question.</TEXT></DOC>
