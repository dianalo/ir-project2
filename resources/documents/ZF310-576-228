The main advantage of BISS, reckons OPGsoftware engineer Hans-Christian Werner, is that any BISS-developed Unixapplication is easily portable to any other Unix system.andP;  OPG has already hada few successes.andP;  BISS is used by the large Essen-based Krupp Lonrhotransport group, and has been commissioned by the German Research Ministry.andO;At the moment, BISS is available only in its original German version, but theplan is to offer a multi-language product in the not-too distant future.andM;BSP sees bright prospects in the eastandM;Undeterred by the poor attendance at the show from the East, BSP SoftwareDistribution GmbH, Regensburg, is clearly looking in that direction for morebusiness in 1991.andP;  Harry Schneider, in charge of Unix product marketing forthe 100-staff, $175m-a-year distributor - which was showing SCO Unix,Informix, Uniplex, and Open Desktop at the Unix Forum - says a Berlindivision is to be established in the second quarter with the aim ofexploiting the new markets.andP;  Schneider admits that under-capitalisation andliquidity problems are endemic in the Eastern market at the moment - Westernbanks and venture capital funding have not been forthcoming - but ironicallymoney has been coming in from better-off countries such as Czechoslovakia.andO;Schneider wants to build up BSP's dealer network by around a fifth next year,and is anxious to get more communications products into the BSP range.andM;Wolf personnel system for Xenix, VMSandM;Berlin-based Wolf Electronic und Messtechnik GmbH, part of the $12m-a-yearWolf Group, was exhibiting its real-time Unix-based Wolf personneladministration system.andP;  Running under Santa Cruz Unix and DEC VMS, the Wolfsystem is linked to a number of remote clocking-in devices that send data toa constantly-updated Ingres database which can store details of up to 5,000employees.andP;  Information on salaries, clock-in times, holiday allowances andthe number of employees available on different shifts can be viewed in up tofive different formats, and linked to a printer, the system will issuecompleted wage slips.andP;  In its first year, seven of the $21,000 systems havebeen sold in Germany - the aim now is to be able to offer it on otherhardware.andM;IQ Products seeks partners with productandM;IQ Products, Munich is a small outfit that sells Unix and VMS products -Wingz, Saber Software Inc's Saber-C development environment and LegatoSystems Inc's Legato networker Unix network data security system to theGerman speaking countries.andP;  IQ Products' Robert Belting says its aim for 1991is to add to its line, and it desperately needs partners.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
