Bush on Monday offered a complex financing scheme mixing taxdollars with higher insurance premiums paid by banks and Sandamp;Ls.   He also called for an overhaul of the financial regulatory systemaimed at preventing Sandamp;L problems from recurring, vowed to pursuewrongdoers in the industry and pledged to protect insured deposits.He recommended no direct fee on depositors.   ``In all the time since creation of the deposit insurance, savershave not lost one dollar of insured deposits and I am determinedthat they never will,'' the president said at a news conference.   Under the Bush plan, which must be approved by Congress, thegovernment would sell $50 billion in 30-year in bonds as needed overthree years to finance the cost of closing or selling about 350failed institutions. That's in addition to the $40 billion pledgedlast year by regulators to rescue and prop up 223 institutions.   Insurance premiums paid by financial institutions, combined withtax dollars, would pay the interest on the bonds and meetregulators' 1988 commitments. Money to pay off the principal on thebonds would come from the Sandamp;L industry.   Sen. Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., the chairman of the SenateBanking Committee, said Bush had presented ``by and large a sensibleproposal'' and that ``the structural reforms make sense.''   However, Riegle said the taxpayer cost was ``a substantial amountof money'' and said he was concerned it would cut into otherprograms such as the fight against drugs and education.   Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, said the public wouldshoulder 54 percent of the burden over the 30-year life of the plan.He estimated the cost to taxpayers at $28.1 billion from 1989through 1994. Over 10 years, the cost would be $39.9 billion.   ``In my view (that) would be a little high,'' said SenateMinority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan,. ``It would begin to crowd some ofthese other programs Congress wants, like education, theenvironment. ... I would propose we shrink the taxpayer impact.''   The spending is structured to help the president meet his ``nonew taxes'' pledge by minimizing the impact on the fiscal 1990budget that Bush will present to Congress on Thursday. Taxpayerspending would amount to $11.1 billion during the remainder of thisfiscal year, but would dip to $1.9 billion in 1990. It would bounceback to $6 billion in 1991.   Bush's plan also would increase the insurance premium paid bySandamp;Ls from the current $2.08 per $1,000 of deposits to $2.30 from1991 through 1994, dropping to $1.80 after that. Banks' premiumswould rise from 83 cents now to $1.20 in 1990 to $1.50 after that.   Administration officials who spoke after Bush left the newsconference stressed that the money raised by the higher bankpremiums would go into the banks' own insurance fund, the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp., and would not directly pay for Sandamp;L problems.   However, the money raised by the bank premiums would count asrevenue on government balance sheets. Thus, the government would beable to spend several billions of taxpayer dollars a year withoutadding to the budget deficit.   ``There is a lot of blue smoke and mirrors in the plan,'' saidRep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House BankingCommittee. ``I estimate that the convoluted (scheme for selling thebonds)) will end up costing the taxpayers $600 million to $1 billiona year.''   Banks and savings and loans likely would try to pass on at leasta portion of the higher insurance premiums to consumers, possibly inthe form of lower interest rates on savings accounts.   ``I would hope that wouldn't happen, but there's no guaranteeingwhat the institutions will do,'' Bush said. ``Nothing is withoutpain when you come to solve a problem of this magnitude.''   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said competition from moneymarket mutual funds and other investments would prevent Sandamp;Ls frompassing on much of the cost. He acknowledged that some banks andSandamp;Ls may get into trouble because of that.   ``There may be some (failures) but in the long run we'll have amuch sounder system,'' he said.   The announcement marked Bush's first attempt as president to dealwith a major problem. He proposed:   _An administrative merger of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,which insures commercial banks, and the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp., which backs Sandamp;L deposits. The agencies' staffswould be combined, but the money in their respective funds would notbe mixed.   _Placing insolvent Sandamp;Ls under the control of the new depositagency. However, a separate three-member board headed by theTreasury secretary would oversee bailout spending.   _Regulatory changes, including steps to reduce the type of riskyinvestments that got the industry into difficulty, and an expandedrole for the Treasury Department in supervising Sandamp;Ls.   _Requiring Sandamp;L owners to put up more of their own money. By June1, 1991, capital requirements would be 6 percent, the same as banksand double the current Sandamp;L requirement.   _An additional $50 million to the Justice Department forinvestigation of wrongdoing within the industry. Maximum civilpenalties against Sandamp;Ls and banks would be raised to $1 million a dayand criminal penalties against executives would go as high as 20years in prison. Regulators also would be given authority to payrewards to informants.</TEXT></DOC>
