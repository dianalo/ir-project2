A Kodak spokesman said the company's suit claims thatCetus's proposed transfer would interfere with pendingarbitration over the rights to the technology, called GeneAmppolymerase chain-reaction technology, or PCR. The arbitrationstems from a research program between 1986 and 1989 in whichCetus, Emeryville, Calif., and Kodak worked together todevelop diagnostic products using various biotechnologytechniques.</LP><TEXT>   In the arbitration, begun in April, Kodak is seekingrights to a broad range of human diagnostic products based onPCR technology, which can be used to identify organisms bytaking tiny genetic &quot;fingerprints&quot; from DNA samples. Cetussaid it believes that Kodak has rights only to a limitednumber of products.   Kodak's suit, filed in the Delaware Chancery Court, claimsthat Cetus's proposed transfer of PCR rights would violate a1986 contract between Kodak and Cetus by transferring Kodak'srights and by revealing trade secrets before the arbitrationruns its course, the Kodak spokesman said. &quot;We feel thearbitration process should proceed before the rights aresold,&quot; the spokesman said.   Kodak's complaint seeks a preliminary injunction againstthe transfer of PCR technology in the diagnostics area andthe disclosure of certain information. Cetus, which announcedits plan to sell its PCR business to Hoffmann-La Roche inJuly, said the transfer wouldn't violate any of Kodak'srights under the 1986 agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
