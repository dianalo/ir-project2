Manuel Antonio Noriega wasdefiant today in the face of a nationwide general strike aimed athis ouster and said his opponents can't overthrow him.   As the strike moved into its fourth day with no sign of letup,Noriega once again lashed out at the opposition and the UnitedStates in a speech to a group of about 500 supporters Wednesdaynight.   The United States, Noriega said, wants to create a Panamanianpolitical system ``in its image and reflecting its plans tosubject'' Central America.   He accused the Reagan administration of misjudging the``patriotic feelings of Panamanians'' because they ``are not madeof chocolate, nor of sugar.''   Washington has been trying to pressure Noriega into leaving thecountry.   The general also criticized his opponents for rejecting hisoffer to resign in exchange for a national dialogue, saying theyhave neither the ``capacity to represent'' nor to defeat ``thenationalistic forces.''   An organization of 25 Latin American nations will hold anemergency meeting Monday to discuss the crisis in Panama, the groupsaid Wednesday. The meeting of the Latin American Economic Systemin Caracas, Venezuela, was requested by Panama.   A prominent opposition leader, Ricardo Arias Calderon, returnedfrom exile to join in the fight to oust Noriega, head of the15,000-strong Panama Defense Forces and the power behind thecivilian government.   Almost all businesses were shut down across the country againWednesday. Lacking food and money, thousands of people lined up atsoup kitchens set up by churches throughout the country.   Also Wednesday, the government ordered a U.S. diplomat expelled,but the State Department said in Washington that economicscounselor David Miller would not leave as demanded. The StateDepartment said it would ignore the order because it considersPanama's government illegitimate.   It gave the same reason for rejecting an earlier attempt toexpel Terence Kneebone, head of the U.S. Information Service inPanama.   In other developments Wednesday, a dozen U.S. soldiers weredetained by Panamanian police, and 100 people shouted anit-Noriegaslogans after a funeral for a man killed at an earlieranti-government rally.   Panama is out of cash because Washington cut off the supply ofU.S. dollars, the Panamanian national currency, in a bid to driveNoriega into exile. The general was indicted in the United Stateslast month on federal cocaine trafficking charges.   Jose Mulino, an attorney active in the opposition National CivicCrusade, acknowledged that some action from within the DefenseForces may be necessary to end the monthlong crisis.   ``There are growing pockets within the Defense Forces that areagainst Noriega,'' he said. ``What we don't know is if they willact.''   Leaders of the crusade _ an alliance of 200 professional,business, labor and other groups formed in June _ suggested someofficers might fear acting against Noriega because of the fate of11 military rebels taken into custody after an abortive coupattempt last week.   Osvaldo Velasquez, head of the Panamanian Committee for HumanRights, said Wednesday, ``We know for certain they are beingtortured.''   Defense Forces members are due to be paid at the end of theweek. Opposition leaders said their loyalty to Noriega could fadeif they, like most other Panamanians, are unable to cash theirchecks because of the freeze on the country's deposits in U.S.banks.   Arias Calderon, president of the opposition Christian DemocraticParty, told a news conference Wednesday in San Jose, Costa Rica,that he would return to Panama today because: ``I want to sharewith the Panamanian people in the dramatic days of fighting fordemocratization of the country.''   Authorities refused to allow Arias Calderon to enter the countrylast month on his return from a business trip. He said he would beaccompanied on an afternoon flight by legislators from CentralAmerican and European countries.   About 300 people attended the funeral Wednesday of AlcibiadesVasquez, 24, a private security guard shot during rioting lastweek. The Panamanian human rights panel said he was killed by apro-government paramilitary squad.   His death was the first in nearly a month of often violent civilunrest that began after President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried tofire Noriega on Feb. 25 and was dismissed the next day. The UnitedStates still recognizes Delvalle, who is in hiding in Panama.</TEXT></DOC>
