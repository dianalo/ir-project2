Malabre Jr. cites another year of expansion as evidence that &quot;seldom has the economy so confounded forecasters.&quot; Though, in retrospect, he sees &quot;solid reasons for the expansion's surprising longevity.&quot;    To the contrary, a majority of forecasters were not looking for a recession within the past year (only 15% of the Blue Chip panel of last May, for example) and for good reason. The key to the durability of the current recovery has been relatively low inflation. This favorable price behavior has resulted in turn from strong competitive pressure from abroad (spurred in large part by the earlier run-up in the dollar), the accompanying modest growth in earlier production, and muted cost-push inclinations in the aftermath of the 1981-1982 recession.    Although the prospects for low inflation are somewhat less favorable than they were a year ago, there is little evidence to suggest a dramatic worsening of core inflationary pressures in the near term. Until this picture changes, the real surprise would be for the expansion to come to an end.    Howard Keen Jr.    Chief Economist   Conrail   Philadelphia</TEXT></DOC>
