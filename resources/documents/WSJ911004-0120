Like the jokedescribing the House bank as Congress's BCCI, the Bank forCheck-Kiting Congressional Incumbents.   Yesterday also saw the appearance of another sure signthat the scandal is serious and that it's heading under therug: Speaker Tom Foley announced that he was closing the bankdown and turning the matter over to the lap-dog House EthicsCommittee, the same Ethics Committee that sanctioned JimWright's intimidation of Sandamp;L regulators as part of his&quot;legislative technique.&quot; The committee's chairman is Rep.Louis Stokes (D., Ohio), who's been identified in pressreports as one of the check-bouncers. Expect a report inDecember 1992.</LP><TEXT>   Speaker Foley also identified himself as onecheck-bouncer, of a check for $540 used to buy stereoequipment. Mr. Foley said he wasn't aware that the check wasdrawn without sufficient funds.   It is hardly an exaggeration to say the mess is beginningto resemble a Stephen King novel; horror stories aboutcongressional outrages are now tumbling out of closets allover Capitol Hill.   Check-kiting isn't the only service that has been offeredby the House bank. It has helped secure loans for Members atpreferred rates with at least one Washington bank. The lateRep. John Ashbrook of Ohio once told the Cleveland PlainDealer that all he needed to secure a loan was to sign astatement guaranteeing that his monthly salary check was ondeposit in the House bank. &quot;The House sergeant-at-arms islike a junior loan officer,&quot; Ashbrook said.   This week, it was revealed that 250 current and formerMembers of Congress owe more than $300,000 in unpaidrestaurant and catering bills. Some of the bills, owed toService America Corp., which until recently served theHouse's restaurants, have been unpaid for five years.   Some younger House Members also tell us, with someembarrassment, of other privileges available. One of the moreinteresting is the House pharmacist, who operates a specialoffice in the Capitol Rotunda to dispense freepharmaceuticals and sundries to Members. &quot;They give meanything I want,&quot; one Member told us. &quot;I can just tell themit's approved by the House physician.&quot; This is the body thatwants to get a handle on the health-cost crisis.   Among the check-bouncers are some well-known CongressionalBigfeet, including GOP Whip Newt Gingrich who claims hebounced only one check that was over $200. Our favorite,though, is Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman JohnDingell, who is famous for issuing subpoenas demandingcarloads of documentary evidence from his victims. TheHouse's Grand Inquisitor admits that he bounced nine checksin February 1990, though he won't reveal the exact amounts.Of course, he doesn't have to because Congress isn't coveredby the Freedom of Information Act.   Any citizen who's ever been raked over the coals in frontof a House committee should enjoy the answers reporters havebeen getting from Members' offices. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski'sspokesman to a Washington Times reporter: &quot;Aren't you ashamedabout having to ask these questions? The answer is, it's noneof your business.&quot; From Rep. Gus Savage (D., Ill.): &quot;Callback when you have a serious question.&quot;   Detailed records of at least one deadbeat surfaced thisweek. The weekly Human Events reported that it had been givencopies of Peter Kostmayer's (D., Pa.) House bank records for1983 to 1985. (Incidentally, the GAO report at the heart ofthis scandal covers only a single year starting in July1989). They show Mr. Kostmayer consistently wrote bad checksto everyone from the Internal Revenue Service to employees inhis congressional office. The records show he often had anegative balance of thousands of dollars while he was writingthe checks. In 1985, he wrote one check for $23,000 oninsufficient funds, which left his account overdrawn by$32,000. Yesterday, Mr. Kostmayer claimed he transferredmoney to his account before the $23,000 check was cashed.   Where is it all heading? The editorialists at the DailyTelegraph in Bluefield, West Virginia, see the end pointclearly: &quot;The only reform that will clean up this monstrouscongressional arrogance can be summed up in six words: Termlimits, term limits, term limits.&quot; Columnist George Willwrote this week that his previous opposition to term limitswas mistaken: &quot;I have changed my mind.&quot; Liberal columnistMark Shields still opposes them, but says Kitegate is &quot;onehell of an argument for term limits.&quot; A term-limit vote willbe held next month in Speaker Foley's home state ofWashington.   We've had the Jim Wright scandal, and we've had theKeating Five debacle hanging around for some time. You wouldthink there'd be little more to learn about the character ofCongress's worst parts. But the most striking revelation atthe bottom of the House bank scandal is that their behavioris so utterly petty.</TEXT></DOC>
