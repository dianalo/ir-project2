His decision was presented as a compromise but seemed likely to provoke an angry reaction from the many congressmen who believe that only Brazil's constituent assembly has the right to determine the mandate and that the presidential term should be four years. President Sarney's announcement, if respected, would mean a direct presidential election in 1989, and a transfer of power to his successor in 1990.    Last night's vehement 15-minute televised address to the nation was clearly aimed at bolstering President Sarney's weakened authority. He said he acted because the debate about his mandate was having a paralyzing effect and was preventing measures to curb inflation, which has soared to an annual rate of more than 800%.    &quot;Indecision paralyzes,&quot; he said, adding that only a five-year term would give a &quot;horizon for (political) projects.&quot;    However, the immediate effect of the speech appeared likely to be a worsening of the simmering conflict that has split the president from the dominant, left-leaning Brazilian Democratic Movement, known by the initials PMDB. Many in the party believe a presidential election must be held next year to complete Brazil's transition to democracy after the two decades of military rule that ended in 1985. President Sarney wasn't directly elected; Tancredo Neves and Mr. Sarney were chosen as president and vice president, respectively, by Brazil's congress in that year. When Mr. Neves died soon after the election, Mr. Sarney became president.    Several commentators suggested that last night's announcement could leave the president isolated from congress -- and much of the Brazilian population -- as well as increasingly reliant on the armed forces. &quot;President Sarney is acting as though, if necessary, he will conform with military tutelage if he can remain for a certain period with at least formal power,&quot; commented a leading columnist, Ricardo Noblat.    President Sarney, who had supported the military regime, said there is &quot;no menace to democratic institutions&quot; but added that &quot;we must anticipate any (possible) deterioration in the situation.&quot; He didn't elaborate. Earlier this month, the military defended the president's rule, saying it could defend the force of its arguments with &quot;the argument of force.&quot;    The president's decision came amid a crisis described by many analysts as the worst in Brazil's recent history. Besides the soaring inflation rate and a slumping trade performance, political conflicts and presidential indecisiveness have created an air of disarray, and the country is without resources while facing the difficulties stemming from its three-month-old debt moratorium.    An opinion poll last weekend, conducted after a major fraud was uncovered in the awarding of contracts for a controversial North-South railroad strongly supported by the president, showed that 80% of the population favored an election next year.    President Sarney last night blamed the &quot;explosion of prices&quot; on &quot;political indefinition.&quot; He said the inflationary spiral -- and the prospect of recession -- were &quot;not economic (problems), but political.&quot; Only decisive political action, and &quot;the union of everybody,&quot; can stop price rises, he added. But he didn&quot;t indicate what action might be taken.    He said that he would defend a term of five years for his successors, and that he favored a presidential, rather than a parliamentary, system -- but with &quot;a strong participation by congress.&quot;    The constitution is being debated by an assembly elected last November. Many members believe it has the right to determine not only future presidential terms, but also the current one.    The president's tone and language suggested he wouldn't be swayed from his decision. &quot;We must demonstrate,&quot; he said, &quot;that civil power is capable of governing.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
