Thousands of Armenians gathered in Yerevan to express gratitudefor foreign aid that followed the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed anestimated 25,000 people, the government newspaper Izvestia reported.   Authorities had banned the traditional celebrations in Yerevanand in Tbilisi, the capital of the Soviet republic of Georgia,because of pro-independance unrest in both cities and because ofthe Armenian earthquake.   Armenian activist Rafael Popoyan said the Yerevan march wasmassive but peaceful. He said participants demanded freedom forjailed members of a group leading the effort to annexNagorno-Karabakh, a disputed region in the neighboring republic ofAzerbaijan.   In Kishinev, capital of the republic of Moldavia, youthsboycotted a rally after student activists were refused their owncolumn in that city's parade, Izvestia said.   The tiny republic on the Romanian border has been the scene ofseveral demonstrations and some violence in recent months asactivists have pressed for greater independence from Moscow.   In Moscow, howver, the mood was decidedly upbeat under brightskies, with the traditional Red Square parade highlighting theofficial tribute to workers of the world.   The emphasis was on progress at home, and there were no directreferences to international issues or the Soviet troop withdrawalfrom Afghanistan.   Access to Red Square is severely restricted for such events, andthe vast majority of Soviets who saw the two-hour parade did so viatelevision.   In an article coinciding with the holiday, the daily newspaperSocialist Industry charged Monday that Soviet trade unions are meregovernment puppets that don't protect workers' rights.   The newspaper, which specializes in labor and economics, calledfor giving labor organizations greater independence.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and members of the CommunistParty's ruling Politburo stood atop Lenin's tomb to viewfestivities as thousands of marchers passed through Red Squarewaving banners, pushing floats and releasing helium-filled balloons.   His wife, Raisa, was absent from the festivities that she hasattended in the past. There was no explanation.   In a section reserved for government dignitaries stood Boris N.Yeltsin, the maverick ousted as Moscow party boss and removed fromthe Politburo last year. He made a remarkable comeback by winning apopular election to represent Moscow in the new parliament thatmeets May 25.   Signs and banners boosted ``perestroika,'' Gorbachev's programto overhaul and modernize Soviet society. There also was increasedattention paid to the environment.   ``To the coming generations: a clean planet,'' pledged onebanner.   In one solemn passage, the parade announcer called forparticipants to remember those who died in Armenia, Georgia and theSoviet submarine accident last month in the Norwegian Sea.   ``It seems that one can hear at the square even now echoes ofrequiems that have not died away in Armenia and Georgia,'' he said,``and the cold sea has not yet dried its salty tears mourning thoseheroes, submariners, who perished ...''   Yerevan has been under curfew for more than six months to curbethnic rivalries that killed more than 90 people in Armennia andAzerbaijan last year. About 20 people died in pro-independenceunrest in Tbilisi last month, and 42 sailors were killed in thesubmarine tragedy.</TEXT></DOC>
