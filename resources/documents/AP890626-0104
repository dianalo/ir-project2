(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Re-enactments staged on the greatbattlefields of the Civil War usually end the same way _ with boysin blue routing the Confederate gray.   But not so in Mississippi this summer.   At Vicksburg, cannons will boom and muskets flash over the Fourthof July weekend to commemorate a clear-cut Confederate victory overYankee troops when Gen. Ulysses S. Grant made his first majorattempt to silence the Mississippi River fortress 126 years ago.   And at Brice's Cross Roads in Lee County, scene of a textbookattack by Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest's cavalry,historians recently replaced 99 markers to unknown Southern deadwith 102 stones bearing the names of Rebel soldiers known to havebeen killed in the June 10, 1864, battle.   The Vicksburg artillery demonstrations and engagements by severalhundred re-enactors will take place Saturday and Sunday on privateland in Vicksburg where the actual engagement being commemoratedoccurred on May 22, 1863.   Grant's all-out attack was beaten back by the Vicksburg garrisonduring a one-day battle that resulted in 3,000 Union soldiers killedor wounded. The Confederates suffered about 500 casualties.   Realizing a direct attack would be too costly, Grant encircledthe city on land and water, starving the garrison into surrender 47days later on July 4, 1863.   ``Last year was the first year we had a re-enactment at Vicksburgand, since it was the 125th anniversary of the siege, we felt itonly appropriate to do the last few days of it, including thesurrender,'' said Gordon Cotton, director of the Old Court HouseMuseum and organizer of the ``Vicksburg Civil War Re-enactment.''   ``We did not realize when we planned last year's event thatre-living those days would be so emotionally straining on everyonehere,'' said Cotton.   ``This year, the re-enactors wanted to do something different,something very dramatic and we didn't want to go through anotherdefeat,'' he said. ``So this battle was the obvious choice.''   Across the state in Lee County, history buff Charles Sullivan andhis associates found another way to remember a Confederate victory.   ``Up to this point, all the battlefields I have marked were ofConfederate defeats,'' said Sullivan, a department head atMississippi Gulf Coast Community College's Perkinston campus andConfederate graves registrar in Mississippi for the Sons ofConfederate Veterans. ``This time it was different.''   At the Brice's Cross Roads battlefield, about six miles west ofBaldwyn, Forrest won a major tactical victory over Gen. S.D.Sturgis' larger Union force. When the fighting ended, over 1,500Union soldiers had been captured.   ``For Forrest, it was a textbook battle that has been studied atwar colleges around the world,'' said Sullivan, who will participatein the re-enactment at Vicksburg. ``Many believe this was hisgreatest victory for, heavily outnumbered, he was able to destroythe federal cavalry first and then the infantry.''   Sullivan said the markers to the unknown dead were placed at thebattle site sometime after 1930, following passage of a federal lawallowing military stones for fallen Confederates.   ``Thanks to the research of a friend named Roger Hansen, who hasa network of colleagues throughout the country who trade informationon Confederate dead, we were able to identify 102 men killed at thecrossroads on the Confederate side.''   Sullivan said the new markers were arranged in alphabetical order``because we know they were placed in a burial pit but we do notknow exactly where each body was situated.''</TEXT></DOC>
