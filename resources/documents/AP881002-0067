(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A court has issued a felony warrant for aMethodist pastor who disappeared in August with his wife andstepchildren after his wife lost custody of the children.   When the Rev. Norman Luecke left Faith United Methodist Church,he left a handwritten letter to church members admitting his actionwas illegal but saying it was necessary if his wife was to keep herchildren.   Luecke and his wife, Sharon Weathers, are now wanted on felonywarrants for interfering with a custody order issued for her twochildren from her previous marriage. They could face up to twoyears in prison and a $10,000 fine if convicted.   Authorities said Zachary Weathers, 7, and his sister, Bethany,4, were not returned to Ms. Weathers' ex-husband, Lindell Weathers,after their summer visitation with the Lueckes ended Aug. 14. Twoweeks earlier, an appeals court had upheld the awarding of custodyto Lindell Weathers.   In his letter to church members, Luecke pleaded forunderstanding.   ``What we are doing is illegal. That bothers me, and I'm suremany would disapprove on that basis alone,'' he wrote. ``But whatthe courts have done to Sharon and her children is immoral andwrong, and so we had to choose and take a stand: accept what isimmoral and wrong or do something that is illegal ourselves.''   Luecke was married with three children of his own and was pastorat Salem Lutheran Church in Shell Lake when he and his wife becamefriends with the Weathers couple.   According to court records, Lindell Weathers concluded in 1985that his wife had begun a romantic relationship with Luecke. Bothcouples subsequently divorced, and Luecke eventually resigned fromthe Lutheran Church, married Sharon and became a Methodist minister.   In 1987, he was named pastor for three Methodist churches inRusk County.   After a lengthy legal battle, Circuit Judge Alvin L. Kelseyawarded Lindell custody of the two Weathers children, saying thateither he or his ex-wife would be good parents but describedSharon's new husband, the pastor, as ``a liar, a cheat (and) ashirker of his own family responsibilities.''   Two weeks before the couple and the children disappeared, theState Court of Appeals upheld Kelsey's custody decision.   Washburn County Sheriff Don Fuller said he sympathizes withWeathers but is unable to undertake a nationwide search until thereis evidence the fleeing couple has left Wisconsin.   ``It almost obsesses you,'' said Weathers, a nursing homeadministrator in Shell Lake. ``It's an unbelievable thing to gothrough, from this end, so I can't imagine what its like for thekids.''</TEXT></DOC>
