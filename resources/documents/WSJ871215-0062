However, federal prosecutors scored a victory in a separate criminal investigation of alleged fraud and kickbacks involving U.S.-financed contracts in the Philippines during Mr. Marcos's rule. Two men pleaded guilty in federal District Court in Alexandria, Va., to charges of conspiracy and submitting false statements in a scheme that prosecutors contend siphoned at least $3 million from a $28 million telecommunications project financed by the Defense Department.    Both investigations were touched off in early 1986, when Mr. Marcos was overthrown. He and his wife, Imelda, fled to the U.S. amid allegations of widespread government corruption, cronyism and personal profiteering. Portions of the Marcos family's private fortune remain subject to criminal investigation by the Justice Department.    The former president already has turned over some documents to prosecutors and may have to testify before the Alexandria, Va., grand jury delving into the telecommunications contracts.    The department had investigated the Westinghouse payments in 1978, but that time, too, it dropped the matter without bringing charges. The case reflects the difficulties prosecutors face in such international inquiries.    The case involves $80 million in alleged payments by Westinghouse to Herminio Disini, an associate of the Marcos family, in connection with a $1.1 billion nuclear-power-plant contract. Prosecutors, who convened a grand jury in Pittsburgh, have sought to determine whether Mr. Marcos benefited from the payment, and whether loans and guarantees from the U.S. Export-Import Bank were properly handled in connection with the project.    Theodore Greenberg, deputy chief of the Justice Department's fraud section, said in a brief interview that the Westinghouse investigation was &quot;being reviewed&quot; by agency officials, but he declined to elaborate. Persons familiar with the review, however, said they expected the case to be dropped early next year.    Westinghouse officials and attorneys for Mr. Marcos weren't available for comment. In the past, the company has acknowledged paying commissions to help secure the nuclear-plant contract, but it hasn't said how much money was involved and has denied any wrongdoing.    Law-enforcement officials said the Westinghouse investigation was hampered by disagreements between U.S. and Philippine investigators over sharing certain evidence, and by delays in obtaining important documents and testimony.    Although some of the same problems also have plagued the telecommunications-project investigation, Mr. Greenberg emphasized that the grand-jury inquiry in that case is continuing. He said Gen. Fabian Ver, former chief of the Philippine armed forces, remains &quot;a principal subject.&quot;    Pleading guilty yesterday were Raymond Moreno, a Philippine national, and John Ward, an American living in the Philippines. Mr. Moreno agreed to pay a total of $1 million in fines, civil claims and back taxes, and to cooperate with the investigation. Mr. Ward, who received a one-year suspended sentence, also agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.    In court papers filed in conjunction with the pleas, prosecutors said Mr. Moreno was associated with Amworld Inc. and other &quot;shell&quot; companies that received Philippine government contracts for work on the U.S.-financed telecommunications project even though they &quot;had no experience with electronics or telecommunications work.&quot; Prosecutors said legitimate contractors were told to agree to &quot;sham marketing contracts&quot; with these companies in order to kick back between 35% and 50% of their proceeds.    Prosecutors want to determine where that money went. And Mr. Moreno's plea agreement, according to court papers, requires him to tell the Justice Department &quot;the extent to which&quot; the subcontractors &quot;were informed&quot; about the details of their arrangements with the contractors. </TEXT></DOC>
