Median rise in daily fecal bloodloss was 432%. All subjects were endoscoped at the initiation and atthe completion of the study. Endoscopic findings were assessed quantitativelyby two observers in two different ways. All subjects but three had gastricmucosal lesions at follow-up endoscopy. There was a good correlationbetween the endoscopic assessments but no statistical correlation betweenthe endoscopic assessment and the increase in fecal blood loss. The datasuggest that factors other than gastric mucosal lesions have to be takeninto account when investigating NSAID-induced gastrointestinal bleeding.</TEXT></DOC>
