<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-12-0763 </DOCNO><TEXT>As part of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory's Least-Cost Utility PlanningProject, we have recently completed a review and assessment of the experienceof 30 energy conservation programs with new commercial buildings in theUS and other countries. The focus was on non-mandatory strategies, whichcomplement, reinforce, or in some cases may substitute for energy-efficiencyrequirements in building codes. The programs are primarily conductedby state and federal agencies and utility companies. The types of programsinvestigated include: large-scale demonstrations, financial incentives,energy rating and labeling, energy awards, design tools, design assistance,and standards-related training, compliance and quality control programs.We focus our discussion on design assistance programs and examine availabledata on market penetration, energy and cost savings, program costs, andcost-effectiveness. Despite the scarcity of quantitative evaluation dataon most programs, we present our major findings and make recommendationsfor program managers interested in designing and implementing energyconservation programs for new commercial buildings. 13 refs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
