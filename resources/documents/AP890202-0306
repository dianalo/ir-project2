(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Illinois Supreme Court cleared theway Thursday for criminal prosecution of five factory officialswhose employees contend they were injured by a ``toxic cocktail''and other unsafe working conditions.   Without dissent, the state's highest court ruled that the federalOccupational Safety and Health Act does not bar criminal prosecutionfor unsafe working conditions.   A Cook County grand jury indicted the five officials of ChicagoMagnet Wire Co. in 1984 on charges of aggravated battery, recklessconduct and conspiracy. However, a circuit judge dismissed theindictments a year later, ruling they were pre-empted by federal law.   The indictment charged that 42 workers suffered nerve and lungdisorders, scars from metals and other problems as a result of theirworking conditions.   Prosecutors said the factory lacked safety equipment, propercooling and ventilation and that workers were exposed to what adoctor who examined them called a ``toxic cocktail'' of hazardouschemicals. They said accounts of conditions at the suburban Chicagofactory, where wire was coated with polyvinyl chloride and otherchemicals, ``resemble a historical narrative about conditions in the`sweat shops' of the mid-19th century.''   The case drew the attention of business groups from across thenation, as well as county prosecutors from Boston, New York and LosAngeles who sought to try similar cases in their areas.   ``The Supreme Court's ruling, which sets a precedent, is ofnational importance,'' said Cook County State's Attorney Richard M.Daley, whose office investigated the case. ``It will help safegaurdthe workers of Illinois from deliberate harm at the hands of a veryfew unscrupulous employers who put profits above the safety of theirworkers.''   Business leaders warned that Thursday's decision could lead to apatchwork of safety standards varying among counties and states,with executives facing criminal sanctions if their factories failedto pass muster.   ``What can an employer do to forsee all of these circumstances,with the possibility that he may be hauled before the grand jury andindicted?'' said Arthur Gottschalk, president of the IllinoisManufacturers Association.   But Daley said only ``a very few unscrupulous employers'' wouldhave anything to worry about.   ``The evidence we uncovered showed that the defendants knew ofthe dangers, did nothing to protect their employees, and in fact,concealed the danger to the workforce,'' he said at a newsconference.   ``This alleged conduct went beyond the issues regulated by OSHAand can only be addressed properly in the criminal courts,'' Daleysaid.   Thursday's ruling also set a possible precedent for anotherIllinois case in which three executives of Film Recovery SystemsInc., a suburban Chicago company, were convicted of murder andsentenced to prison in the death of a factory worker who was exposedto cyanide on the job.   That case, currently on appeal, was the first in U.S. history inwhich corporate executives were convicted of murder in asafety-related workplace death.   In their opinion Thursday, the Illinois justices noted that theU.S. Supreme Court decided a similar pre-emption question inupholding a punitive damage award to the estate of Karen Silkwood,the Kerr-McGee Corp. worker whose death brought national attentionto safety concerns in the nuclear industry.   ``It is totally unreasonable to conclude that Congress intendedthat OSHA's penalties would be the only sanctions available forwrongful conduct which threatens or results in serious physicalinjury or death to workers,'' Justice Daniel P. Ward wrote for thecourt.   Harvey Silets, a attorney for one of the defendants, haspredicted that the case ultimately will go to the U.S. SupremeCourt. He and other defense lawyers did not return telephone callsseeking comment on Thursday's decision.</TEXT></DOC>
