Friday's Wall Street plunge had pushed the Nasdaq composite to a 10-week low, and although the index yesterday lost only 1.40 to 372.36, the close broke through a short-term low point set in September. The composite is at its lowest since May 31.    As a measure of small-stock weakness yesterday, even though declining issues badly outnumbered advancers, there wasn't much difference in terms of shares. There were 763 advancing issues on about 30.3 million shares, and 1,218 decliners on about 36.8 million shares.    And a barometer of Nasdaq's tiniest issues was also weak. Among the one-third, and generally smallest or most lightly traded, Nasdaq issues that aren't a part of the Nasdaq National Market System, decliners held a 2-1 advantage over advancers, by 237 to 112.    But Nasdaq's major stocks benefited from a minor early morning rally in New York Stock Exchange blue chips, and most closed higher. Among others, MCI Communications added 1/4 to 21 5/8, Apple Computer gained 3/8 to 38 7/8 and Liz Claiborne rose 1/4 to 16 1/4. And most big-stock declines were modest; Intel, for example, declined 1/4 to 23 3/4 and Jaguar, one of Nasdaq's most popular foreign issues, slipped 1/32 to 4 29/32. The Nasdaq 100 index of the market's biggest nonfinancial issues declined only 0.57 to 337.91.    OTC technical analysts say the composite index could drop a further 10 points in the next month or so. One analyst, Christine Callies of Dean Witter Reynolds, said: &quot;Considering the extensive preparation for a coordinated decline in the industrials, banks, and the composite {index}, and the lack of any evidence to suggest that these breaks are false, the odds favor at least a modest extension of price weakness over the next four to six weeks.&quot;    One part of the market that has been buoyant has been cellular stocks, but that sector took a tumble yesterday.    LIN Broadcasting, hurt by a Barron's column calling its price &quot;just a tad rich,&quot; fell 1 7/8 to 57 3/8 on 419,500 shares. Other cellular stocks that in general had been benefiting from good publicity about the hot industry also fell. Among others, Vanguard Cellular Systems fell 1 to 24, Cellular Communications fell 1/2 to 21 and U S West NewVector Group declined 3/4 to 21 1/4.    John S. Reidy, a Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst who recommends LIN, says cellular investors have been cheered this month by the purchase and sale by Vanguard of two cellular franchises for around $145 per POP-industry lingo for the price per person living in the area where the franchise is granted. The transactions involved franchises in New Hampshire, North Carolina and Georgia.    According to Mr. Reidy, the transaction prices &quot;suggest that subscribers in markets like LIN has -- New York, Philadelphia, Dallas, Houston -- would get even more.&quot; As it is, LIN's stock price reflects $100 per POP, he says. &quot;It's a good buy,&quot; he asserted.    The Barron's story that depressed LIN's price argued that even though the cellular industry might grow briskly, POPs are &quot;kind of deceptive&quot; as a measure because only a fraction of the public of any franchise area actually subscribes to a service.    In any case, Mr. Reidy says, &quot;people are paying high prices to acquire franchises. So it shows the market is very strong for cellular systems.&quot;    Among other stocks, Safeguard Health Enterprises climbed 1 to 6 3/4. The company said an outside shareholder, who wasn't identified, indicated that an investor group he represents is considering making a $10-a-share acquisition offer.    PhoneMate added 1 3/8 to 5 13/16. Asahi Corp. of Japan, which already owns about 2.2 million of the company's shares, has offered to acquire the rest for $6.50 each.    Alco Health Services jumped 3 1/8 to 28 1/2. The company said it agreed to a takeover offer of $31 a share from a group including members of its management.    Onondaga Savings Bank, which had been soaring, slid 1 1/2 to 11. Onandaga denied that it is involved in takeover talks.    Chiron rose 3/4 to 14 1/4 on news that Ciba-Geigy will buy one million common shares from the company for $20 each. Following the purchase, the Swiss company will hold a 7.9% stake. </TEXT></DOC>
