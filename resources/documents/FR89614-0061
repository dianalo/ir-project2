Section 507 of the Act amends section 11 of the Federal DepositInsurance Act by adding to it Subsection J. This new subsection requiresthe FDIC to consider the adverse economic impact of its actions on localcommunities including businesses and farms, during the administration andliquidation of loans of a closed bank.Section 507(3) of the statute requires the FDIC to adopt guidelines tominimize the adverse economic effects caused by its actions. Specifically,the Corporation is requested to consider actions including the releaseof proceeds from the sale of products for living and business expensesand the shortening of the decision making process for the acceptance ofsettlement offers contingent upon third party financing. The Division'spolicies and guidelines as contained in its Delegation of Authority andthe Credit and Agricultural Manuals address these concerns. Specifically,Bank Liquidation Specialists are directed to refer to the following:1. <T3>Release of Proceeds</T3> (I.C.5.1, Agricultural Manual). This Sectiongoverns FDIC policies permitting the Release of Proceeds resulting fromthe sale of livestock or crops and permits release of such proceeds whenit is in the interest of the Corporation, either in protecting the ongoingbusiness or the FDIC's collateral position. Additionally, releases of proceedsfor living expenses may be considered when loans remain secured. This sectionprovides the relevant information necessary to make these decisions aswell as providing an expedited format to assure quick approval. In thosesituations when time is of the essence, verbal approval received from theRegional Office is allowed.2. <T3>Borrower Requests for Additional Funding</T3> (I.C.6.1, AgriculturalManual). While there are few instances in which the FDIC will advance moneyfor anything other than the protection of collateral, this section providesalternatives to advancing funds which apply to agriculture and other businesssituations. Assisting the borrower in securing advances from another financialinstitution is one such alternative. Additionally, in the event of an EmergencyCrop Advance Request, emergency case forms are provided to facilitate analysisand achieve expedited approvals.3. <T3>Delegations of Authority</T3> (Appendix A of the Credit Manual andI.C.7.1 of the Agricultural Manual). The FDIC's Board of Directors amendedits Delegations of Authority to enable the Division of Liquidation to morequickly reach decisions regarding credit matters and to reduce the numberof decisions in the field which require either Washington or Regional Officeapproval. Additionally, provisions have been made for Regional Officesto provide furher delegations to each Field Site. These delegations haveenhanced the ability of Bank Liquidation Specialists and liquidation sitestaffs to obtain the necessary approvals for all credit actions in a timelyfashion.Copies of The Division of Liquidation's Delegations of Authority, CreditManual and Agricultural Manual are available upon request at the followinglocation: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the ExecutiveSecretary, 550 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20429.<ITAG tagnum="21">By order of the Board of Directors.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Washington, DC, this 6th day of June 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Hoyle L.
