(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   On March 25, Ants Paju will mark the40th anniversary of the day he was placed on a train as a boy anddeported to Siberia.   The next day, the bearded 44-year-old journalist will standagainst a top official for the right to represent central Estonia ina new parliament in Moscow.   In the small Baltic republics, the cracks between Russians andethnic Balts and between the Communist Party and the reform-mindedPeople's Front are widening as the election draws near.   Paju, editor of the nature magazine Eesti Loodus, is runningagainst the head of the Estonian state agricultural-industrialcomplex, Gustav Tonspoeg, on a platform that mixes environmental andeconomic issues with the spiritual renewal activists say is crucialto the survival of tiny Estonia.   ``The worse the internal state of people, the greater thepossibilities of doing terrible things to our environment,'' Pajusaid in an interview.   Paju is the son of an Estonian peasant who also was deported toSiberia and died there after the Soviet Union took control of theBaltic republic in 1940. He was put on a train with a woman he didnot know _ his mother was required to remain in Estonia _ and sentto Siberia until after Josef Stalin died in 1953.   Now he hopes to become a member of the 2,250-member Congress ofPeople's Deputies, which President Mikhail S. Gorbachev says musthelp turn the Soviet Union into a nation governed by laws ratherthan personal dictate.   Estonia has gone further than Latvia and Lithuania in assertingits independence from Moscow, declaring its sovereignty Nov. 16.Although Moscow rejected that claim, the two sides have managed toavoid an open conflict. However, Estonia has not backed down.   Estonian activists say that in contrast to the other Balticrepublics, their Communist Party and government leadership stronglysupport the grassroots People's Front political movement strivingfor autonomy from Moscow.   Candidates such as Paju and scientist Endel Littmaa, 58, haveappeared to push the People's Front's program.   ``Without criticizing everything left and right, it's unlikelyyou'll be elected,'' said Littmaa.   Rifts have appeared between ethnic Estonians, who make up about60 percent of the population, and Russians, who comprise the rest.   Russians fear that decisions making Estonian the officiallanguage, restoring the national flag of the Estonian republic, andmoves for economic self-sufficiency will make them second-classcitizens.   Just as ethnic Estonians rallied around the People's Front,Russians have joined a new organization called Interfront. Thenewspaper Sovietskaya Estonia said that of the 742 delegates seatedfor its organizing convention last weekend, 572 were Russians. Only11 were ethnic Estonian.   An Estonian journalist, Tarmu Tammerk, said the March 26balloting is more likely to break down on ethnic lines than partyversus People's Front.   Reports in Tallinn said Interfront was organizing a generalstrike for March 14. The republic's reform-minded Communist Partychief Vaino Vyalyas went on radio and television Tuesday to appealfor calm and reject extremism.   But Estonian activists pledge to fight on. A plan designed tomake state-run enterprises answer to Tallinn rather than Moscowministries is likely to come before the legislature this month. Theplan is called IME, an acronym that stands for EconomicSelf-Government in Estonia, but also means ``miracle'' in Estonian.   In the Latvian capital of Riga, Latvians and Russians also aresplit, but the party apparatus led by Janis Vagris is wedgeduneasily between the two.   Latvia has the highest concentration of Russians of any of theBaltic republics, about 50 percent, and a twin of the EstonianInterfront, the Inter-Nationalist Front, is active.   Vagris criticized it and the Latvian People's Front in January.``Both movements have some extremist-minded elements,'' he said.``Both also involve members of the Communist Party, which means thatthere is also stratification within the party.''   Latvian activists accuse Vagris of tilting away from reforms bypermitting criticism in the local press of the Movement for theNational Independence of Latvia, a group that cooperates with thePeople's Front but seeks outright independence. The party's CentralCommittee also called for punishment of Latvian journalists formuckracking pieces it said whip up ill-feelings between Latvians andRussians.   The Russian-language daily Sovietskaya Latvia said Tuesday that90 percent of the 96 candidates for 40 seats in the March 26election were party members.   But that may be of little comfort to Vagris. The paper also said75 percent of the candidates are ethnic Latvians, and People's Frontofficials say roughly 75 percent support its aims.   Lithuania's Sajudis, or People's Front, has come in for thesharpest criticism from the Communist Party, which accused it lastmonth of crossing over from support for the party to clearopposition in some cases.   In a document dated Feb. 24, the grassroots organization said theelection campaign was making some party and economic officialsfearful for their posts and privileges.   But it also moved to bolster the Lithuanian party leadership,which it views as reform-minded.   Alvydas Medalinskas, a top Sajudis spokesman, said theorganization had withdrawn candidates running against Lithuanianparty chief Algirdas Brazauskas and his deputy, Vladimir Beriozov,leaving them unopposed. He said Sajudis wanted to strengthen themagainst a ``Stalinist'' wing of the Lithuanian party.</TEXT></DOC>
