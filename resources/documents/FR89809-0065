In addition,TEMCO requests blanket authorization to import volumes not purchased bythe LDC customers, up to 75,000 Mcf per day during the same term, for short-termsales. The gas would be purchased in Canada by TEMCO from Esso ResourcesCanada, Ltd., and immediately resold in Canada to Long Island LightingCompany (LILCO), Public Service Electric andamp; Gas Company (PSEandamp;G),and Baltimore Gas andamp; Electric Company (BGandamp;E). TEMCO will arrangefor transportation of the gas from the Province of Alberta to the LDCs'pipeline systems in New York, New Jersey, and Maryland over both existingand proposed U.S. transmission facilities. The volumes would enter theU.S. near Niagara Falls, New York.The application is filed under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act and DOEDelegation Order Nos. 0204-111 and 0204-127.

TEMCOis also an affiliate of Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco)and sells gas purchased from a variety of sources to customers on and offTransco's system.On July 8, 1988, TEMCO entered into separately-negotiated sales contractswith BGandamp;E and LILCO, and on July 14, 1989, with PSEandamp;G for the purchaseof the imported gas. Under these sales agreements, the price paid to TEMCOwould be established monthly and billed on the basis of a demand/commoditypricing structure. TEMCO states that the maximum demand charge for transportationunder any agreement would be no greater than 30 percent of the total deliveredprice. According to the application, the delivered, city-gate price paidby an LDC each month would be determined by TEMCO's weighted average salesprice (WASP) of all gas sold by TEMCO in the prior month, plus the costsincurred by TEMCO for transportation of the imported gas from the Albertawellhead. Further, in calculating the monthly delivered price, the WASPwould be reduced by an amount established in each contract to take intoaccount the difference in transportation costs for imported gas receivedfrom Alberta and domestically produced gas received from the U.S. GulfCoast. Adjustments to the WASP under the three contracts are 40 cents forBGandamp;E, 36 cents for LILCO, and 43 cents for PSEandamp;G. TEMCO statesthat its WASP for June 1989, was $1.624 per MMBtu. Using this WASP, TEMCOstates that the delivered cost of gas to the LDCs in July, under the maximumpricing provisions, would be $2.684 (U.S.) per MMBtu for LILCO, $2.644for BGandamp;E, and $2.614 for PSGandamp;E at 100 percent load factor. Thesecity-gate prices include the 100 percent load factor transportation rateof $.95 for Canadian transportation and $.47 for U.S. transportation. TheU.S. transportation rate includes $.122 for Transco's producer settlementpayment surcharge. TEMCO states that the pricing formula is subject torenegotiation if TEMCO's WASP is no longer competitive with the deliveredcost of U.S. Gulf Coat gas supplies.Each sales agreement also includes a price cap which TEMCO states is designedto ensure that the imported gas remains competitive with gas prices chargedby major U.S. pipelines serving that LDC. The maximum ceiling price containedin any agreement is the 100 percent load factor sales rate for the interstatepipeline(s) serving the LDC, plus 30 cents.According to TEMCO, no customer is required to purchase gas which exceeds50 percent of their contract demand during the summer months and 65 percentof their contract entitlement on an annual basis. If an LDCs annual takesof gas fall below its agreed level of purchase, a deficiency charge maybe assessed which is no greater than 20 percent of the average commoditysales price in effect during the annual period.The proposed imports would enter the U.S. near Niagara Falls, New York,and would be transported on the pipeline systems of Tennessee Gas PipelineCompany (Tennessee), National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National), andTransco. All three pipelines are proposing to construct new facilitiesthrough which TEMCO's imports would be transported. Applications to constructthese facilities and provide transportation service to TEMCO are pendingbefore the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in Tennessee DocketNo. CP88-171-000, National Docket No. CP88-94-000, and Transco Docket No.CP88-92-000.The decision on TEMCO's application for import authority will be made consistentwith the DOE's gas import policy guidelines, under which the competitivenessof an import arrangement in the markets served is the primary considerationin determining whether it is in the public interest (49 FR 6684, February22, 1984). Other matters that may be considered in making a public interestdetermination include need for gas and security of the long-term supply.Parties that may oppose this application should comment in their responseson the issues of competitiveness, need for the gas, and security of supplyas set forth in the policy guidelines. The applicant asserts that thisimport arragement is in the public interest because the volumes are neededby the LDCs, the price of the gas is competitive, and its Canadian supplieris reliable. Parties opposing the import arrangement bear the burden ofovercoming these assertions.All parties should be aware that if the requested import is approved, theauthorization would be conditioned on the filing of quarterly reports indicatingvolumes imported and the purchase price. All parties should also be awarethat, in accordance with its present policy and past practice, if FE approvesthe blanket authorization, it may limit the term to two years.<ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Compliance</ITAG>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>) requires the DOE to give appropriate consideration tothe environmental effects of its proposed actions. The FERC, is currentlyperforming an environmental review of the impacts of constructing and operatingthe proposed facilities related to this project. The DOE will independentlyreview the results of the FERC environmental evaluation of this projectin the course of making its own environmental determination. No final decisionwill be issued in this proceeding until the DOE has met its NEPA responsibilities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Procedures</ITAG>In response to this notice, any person may file a protest, motion to interveneor notice of intervention, as applicable, and written comments.
