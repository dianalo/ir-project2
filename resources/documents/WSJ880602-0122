This is evident in their recent decision touching on the constitutionality of abusive damages and in Tuesday's announcement that they won't hear any of these claims this term. The message to defendants seems to be: Get your litigation act together so the courts have a chance to help end the liability crisis.    This compelling constitutional and commercial legal issue broke the surface awhile back when a Mississippi state-court jury socked Bankers Life andamp; Casualty Co. with a verdict of $1.6 million in punitive damages for &quot;wrongfully&quot; challenging a $20,000 insurance claim. Plaintiff Lloyd Crenshaw filed the claim when his leg was amputated after an accident; the insurers thought that his degenerative arteriosclerotic disease made the amputation unavoidable. For their appeal, the insurers consulted a lawyer who'd been steeped in original-intent jurisprudence at the Reagan Justice Department. Theodore Olson of Gibson, Dunn andamp; Crutcher suggested that salvation might lie in invoking the Eighth Amendment prohibition that &quot;excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.&quot;    Mr. Olson traced the excessive fines clause back to Magna Carta, which set limits on wites and amercements. These were the punishing -- hence, punitive -- fees originally owed to the Crown beyond the compensatory damages owed to injured parties. One of the modern abuses is that punitive damages are now windfalls directly to plaintiffs. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Eight other defendants with similar multimillion-dollar punitive judgments against them then amended appeals of their cases to include this intriguing constitutional argument. All of a sudden, it looked as if abusive punitive damages might be on the way out, and that a huge wet blanket was descending on the litigation explosion.    At the oral argument in Bankers Life andamp; Casualty v. Crenshaw last November, Justice Scalia acknowledged Mr. Olson's Eighth Amendment argument. Then he surprised even Mr. Olson by suggesting there might be an even stronger case that any civil damages that are so far in excess of any possible criminal fine might violate the due process clause. Afterward, both sides filed more briefs on this issue. In the meantime, the Supreme Court put on hold the other cases making similar arguments.    The court's May 16 opinion was mixed. A majority decided not to deal with the excessive fines or due process arguments on the ground that these points hadn't been raised at the trial stage. However, the opinion was full of language inviting defendants to give the justices another chance in later cases to rule on this issue.    Justice Marshall wrote that there was indeed a &quot;cognizable constitutional challenge to the size of the award,&quot; but that &quot;our need for a properly developed record on appeal&quot; was especially great with such a &quot;question of some moment and difficulty.&quot; Justice Marshall suggested that states might themselves outlaw abusive punitive damages, but that &quot;any ultimate review of the question that we might undertake will gain the benefit of a well-developed record and a reasoned opinion on the merits.&quot;    In a separate opinion, Justices Scalia and O'Connor agreed the issue would have to await another case, but suggested that punitive damages must go. &quot;This grant of wholly standardless discretion to determine the severity of punishment appears inconsistent with due process,&quot; they wrote.    This week, the court announced it wouldn't hear the other punitive damages appeals either. Justices Scalia, O'Connor and Kennedy thought at least some had properly presented lower courts with the constitutional arguments. The best explanation for the turndown is that while the justices may be tempted to throw out punitive damages, they'd like the lower courts to have their say on the issues first.    Insurers, banks and manufacturers have an excellent legal case. The justices told them so. Perhaps the best precedent for the task now facing these punitive-damage, deep-pocket defendants is the civil-rights litigation of the 1960s. A jointly developed strategy would include invocations of the excessive fines and due process clauses whenever lawsuits are filed for punitive damages. They should be ready to wait for the best legal test case.    It's rare these days for the Supreme Court to offer hospitality for business issues. The justices probably understand that the continuing tort crisis has become a significant social problem, as valuable goods, services and even civic activities disappear into the black hole of liability. With this invitation to return for relief, the justices have made businesses an offer they can't refuse. </TEXT></DOC>
