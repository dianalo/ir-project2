Thousands of Gulf Coast residents from Louisiana to Texas beganreturning home to areas struck only a glancing blow by the mainstorm, at one time the most powerful on record in the WesternHemisphere.   ``What could have been one of the most deadly storms in historyappears to have missed us,'' said Betty Turner, mayor of CorpusChristi.   Texans inland braced for more twisters and flash flooding, withas much as 20 inches of rain expected.   A tornado Saturday evening damaged 50 homes and destroyed 15 inDel Rio, 150 miles west of San Antonio and just northwest of theMexican border, officials said. Two people were treated for minorinjuries and released, but scores of others spent the night withrelatives or stayed in shelters set up in the city, said policedispatcher Don Weaver.   Gilbert was downgraded early Saturday to a tropical storm. Atmidday, its top sustained winds were 35 mph and it was downgradedto a tropical depression.   A woman was killed Saturday when a tornado hit her mobile homesouth of San Antonio, some 300 miles north of Brownsville. A mandied in San Antonio when a tree toppled onto his house during athunderstorm Friday.   In Alabama, a man trying to cross a rain-swollen creek inTallapoosa County southeast of Birmingham was swept to his deathearly Saturday, officials said.   A tornado heavily damaged a San Antonio apartment complex justafter sunrise.   ``I just heard a loud, loud roar, like the wind blowing throughthe broken patio door in my living room,'' said Wes Spencer, whoseapartment was hit.   ``I just looked out, I freaked out. The roofs were gone on thebuildings. Cars were tossed all over the parking lot.''   San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros also signed a disasterdeclaration for his city so Air National Guard personnel could flyin parts needed to repair air conditioning at two hospitals hit bytornadoes earlier Saturday.   At least 98 deaths and billions of dollars in damage were blamedon the storm in the Caribbean and Mexico. An additional 200 peoplewere feared drowned after a river swollen by rain from thehurricane jumped its banks and overturned four buses Saturday inMonterrey, Mexico.   The storm never made an expected turn to the north and sparedthe Texas coast, where thousands had fled to shelters afterboarding up homes and businesses along the entire length of thestate's 370-mile coastline.   Gilbert rolled ashore late Friday afternoon in northeasternMexico with 120 mph wind about 150 miles south of Brownsville,where gusts of 82 mph were recorded at South Padre Island.   Laurie Swayze Miller, owner of a Harlingen jewelry store, pickedup the pieces after a twister hit her shop.   ``A policeman found a diamond ring out in the parking lot,'' shesaid.   Wind gusted to nearly 40 mph at midday at Brownsville, butcoastal residents were allowed to return to their boarded-up homesto begin cleaning up. Damage from the hurricane itself appeared tobe minor.   South Padre Island and Port Isabel, which had expected toreceive the brunt of the once-fierce storm when it roared ashore,reopened to the public at noon. Other coastal cities began closingemergency shelters.   ``I was surprised because I was expecting a lot of water,''Eduardo Campiran, South Padre Island city manager, said Saturday.``We have no knowledge of significant damage. Most of the damage islike roofs, windows, awnings, this kinds of stuff.''   South Padre Island Mayor Bob Pinkerton Jr. estimated the stormwould cost local businesses $3 million to $5 million in losttourist revenue but said he expected business to be back to normalby next weekend.   Only a few low-lying coastal roads remained closed because offlooding.   The greatest damage appeared to be to trees, with many uprootedor missing branches.   ``It just trimmed the trees a little and that's about it,'' RonReynolds, 31, said as he cleaned up around his home. ``My neighborback there had a tree go through a fence. We came through it reallucky.''   At 11 a.m., the National Hurricane Center put the storm center220 miles west-southwest of Brownsville and 45 miles southwest ofMonterrey, Mexico, moving toward the west-northwest at 12 mph.   Tornado and flash flood watches and warnings were posted for a26-county area of southern Texas.   Inland rainfall of 10-15 inches was likely with up to 20 inchespossible, forecasters said.   Gilbert's remnants should bring very heavy rain to the RioGrande Valley before heading north up the Mississippi Valley as a``huge rain-making machine,'' said Mark Zimmer, meteorologist atthe National Hurricane Center.   In the 24 hours up to 7 a.m., Brownsville received 4.53 inchesof rain. In Louisiana, Reserve reported 5.7 inches in 24 hours.   By midweek, the storm should be in the lower Ohio River Valleyand end up in the Great Lakes as nothing more than foul weather,forecasters said.   ``The people in the Midwest better dust off their umbrellas,''Zimmer said.</TEXT></DOC>
