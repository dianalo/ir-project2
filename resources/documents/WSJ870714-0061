In addition, American Airlines said its pilots who participated in a taped conversation during the incident remain on active duty. In an earlier edition, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration erroneously stated that the crews from all three airlines had been removed from flight status following the incident. Delta has acknowledged that its pilot was removed from active duty.    (See: &quot;U.S. Cooperating in Canadian Inquiry of a Near Midair Collision of Two Jets&quot; -- WSJ July 14, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
