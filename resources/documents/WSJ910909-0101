Ontario might seem like an inhospitable environment forsocialist doctrine. Two-thirds of its households own theirown homes. Five of North America's 12 biggest banks are basedhere, as is the continent's third-biggest stock exchange.Ontario contains the single largest concentration of U.S.foreign investment anywhere in the world. Wages here arehigh.</LP><TEXT>   Even so, the socialist New Democratic Party came to powerhere a year ago. Bob Rae's NDP won only 37% of the vote, butthe peculiarities of a three-party political system gave it ahandsome majority in the provincial legislature. And becauseCanada's decentralized federation puts the preponderance ofeconomic decision-making in the hands of the provinces,Ontario's nine million people have become socialism's latestset of lab mice.   Before the election, Mr. Rae had assured voters that hisparty understood the meaning of the East European revolutionsof 1989, that it appreciated &quot;the need for realistic pricing,a respect for supply and demand, an understanding of thepositive role of competition. . . .&quot; But his mollifyingpre-election words quickly proved empty.   Even before 1990, Ontario was heavily taxed. The Raegovernment has set about making that worse.   Public spending jumped 13.4% in the government's firstyear and is scheduled to grow fast over the four yearsremaining in the government's term. The government's wagebill spurted 14.5% this year -- after an average annualincrease of 8% in each of the past seven years. Ontario'salready generous welfare expenditure was goosed by nearly40%. Now the value of the cash and services a welfarehousehold of four can claim is the equivalent of theafter-tax income retained by a family of four earning $35,000(Canadian). The government also has been unable to resist theexpensive temptation to bail out failing companies: The nextbeneficiary seems likely to be the 5,000-employee AlgomaSteel Plant in Sault Ste. Marie, at a cost that could reach$600 million (Canadian).   This April, Finance Minister Floyd Laughren imposedsubstantial new taxes. And although Mr. Rae promised at thebeginning of last week that there will be no major taxincrease in the coming year, two days later Mr. Laughren wasmusing that there might not be so much &quot;resistance&quot; to taxesif &quot;the taxes that are being imposed are being used in anappropriate way.&quot;   It is hard to see how more taxes can be avoided. Thegovernment has pledged itself to a spending program thatrequires revenue growth of 9.8% a year if the alreadycrushing budget deficit is to be prevented from gettingworse. Government Policy Consultants, an Ottawa-based firm,notes that government revenues in Ontario usually increase ata rate of about 90% of economic growth. Since even the NDP'scheerful economists are predicting an average of only 3.7%growth for the next three years, massive tax increases areobviously coming. Liberal Party finance critic Sean Conway ispredicting that they will amount to $5 billion (Canadian)over the next three years, about a 10% increase in the burdenof government.   And they will be tax increases of a particularly damagingkind. Almost immediately after coming into office, the NDPestablished a &quot;Fair Tax Commission&quot; chaired by a radical lawprofessor, with a mandate to research ways to transfer theburden of taxation from personal income to capital.   These looming capital taxes will cripple the government'shopes for a radical overhaul of Ontario's industrial economy.More than 16% of the Ontario work force is in manufacturing,especially autos and auto parts. Foreign competition andautomation endanger many of those jobs and the pro-NDP unionsthey maintain. In an important appendix to its April budget,the government proposed to cope with this threat tomanufacturing employment by helping labor unions forcemanufacturing wages upward. Higher wages, it believes, willsend a signal to local employers that they must make massiveinvestments in their plants to boost productivity.   This strategy for eliciting more investment fromemployers, however, bumps into the government's fiscaltroubles. Ontario's high and rising taxes on existingcapital, and its even higher and more rapidly rising taxes onthe entrepreneurs who will create future capital, aredepriving employers of any incentive to make thoseinvestments. So the government has a backup plan: It willstep in to replace private investors and their sordidemphasis on profit by finding &quot;better ways to channel thecapital resources of Ontario.&quot;   Mr. Rae has already provided a small indication of what hehas in mind. His government has proposed a tax break tosavers who invest in union-controlled mutual funds that willdirect investment to Ontario manufacturing enterprises. Butthe true answer, many New Democrats believe, is to be foundnext door, in Quebec, where the government-controlled Caissede Depot selectively directs more than $30 billion (Canadian)of government employee pension funds to favored Quebeccorporations.   The NDP's commitment to making Ontario a high-wage economyis steely. Early this month, a draft of the government'sproposed new labor code was leaked to the press. If enacted,the code would outlaw the use of replacement workers and theuse of non-unionized employees to do the work of strikingunionized employees. It would also forbid members of a unionon strike to return to work without permission from unionleaders.   And more intervention into labor markets is to come. Thegovernment has promised new legislation this fall toencourage employers to hire more &quot;visible minorities,&quot; morewomen, more handicapped people and more native Indians.Nobody knows yet what the new law will look like, but justlast year, when still in opposition, Mr. Rae himselfintroduced a bill that would have required all employers withannual payrolls of more than $300,000 (Canadian) to setnumerical hiring quotas.   In February, the labor ministry released draft legislationthat would extend what Canadians call &quot;pay equity&quot; -- meaninggovernment power to order wage raises for women workers itconsiders underpaid -- to 400,000 more of Ontario's twomillion working women.   Although the government abandoned on Friday its plan tonationalize its automobile insurance industry, Mr. Rae stillseems to hold his old dream of nationalizing rental housing.In 1989, he said in an interview that &quot;as long as largecorporations own land . . . we will have profound problemswith the size of rents.&quot; Now he is stiffeningalready-draconian rent controls. Property prices weredropping in Ontario even before the NDP took office. Over thepast year, the price of property with rental income hasdropped by a third -- when a buyer can be found at all.   It's been an expensive education in economics for Ontario.But Ontarians can console themselves that they are providingthe rest of the world with a useful lesson. Postcommunistsocial democracy turns out to mean exactly what socialdemocracy has always meant: fiscal irresponsibility,truckling to unions, pandering to specialinterest groups, andconfiscatory taxation.   ---   Mr. Frum is an assistant editorial features editor at theJournal.</TEXT></DOC>
