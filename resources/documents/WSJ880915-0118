In the 12 months ended in March, 56% of the 15.8 million mothers with children under the age of six were working or looking for work, a proportion nearly unchanged from a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rate had been rising steadily since 1971, when it was 31%.    But the numbers aren't being interpreted as a retreat by women from the workplace to the home.    The data probably reflect a shortage of day-care facilities and services that is pushing some mothers from the workplace, as well as the possibility that women continue working after having one child but quit after the second, according to David Bloom, a professor of economics at Columbia University.    &quot;A higher fraction of women with children under six have two or more children now than before,&quot; he said, &quot;and it may not make economic sense anymore&quot; to pay for child care and go to work. But he doesn't see it as &quot;a return to the traditional family values and activities,&quot; partly because future labor shortages are going to provide &quot;enormous pressure for women to continue working.&quot;    &quot;The rate could be stabilizing,&quot; said Howard Hayghe, a Bureau of Labor Statistics economist, who speculated that the inflationary and other economic pressures of the 1970s and early 1980s may have eased for many people.    The agency said labor-force participation by married women with children under six remained about the same as a year earlier, while the rate fell among mothers who were separated, divorced, widowed or never married. </TEXT></DOC>
