(ZDS), Groupe Bull SpAtook another step toward greatness in 1989, overtaking Ing.andP;  C. Olivetti andamp;Co. to become Europe's second largest computer company.andP;  But Bull also took astep backward into the red after four years of modest profits.andM;The acquisition of ZDS boosts Bull's revenues by some Fr8.5 billion ($1.3billion), giving the company total revenues (on a projected, pro forma basis)of Fr41.3 billion ($6.5 billion) at the start of 1990.andP;  However, not takingZDS into account, Bull's revenues increased by only a meager 4% to Fr32.7billion ($5.1 billion).andP;  After posting net earnings of Fr303 million ($51million) in 1988, the firm lost Fr267 million ($41.8 million) in 1989.andM;That figure accounts for Fr405 million ($63.5 million) in restructuring costsassociated with plans to shrink Bull's French work force by 1,200 in 1990from the present total of 18,500.andP;  Some 1,800 jobs were shed in France from1988 to 1989, with an earlier 3,200 positions eliminated  n the United Statesfrom 1987 to 1988.andM;Aside from adding revenues, the ZDS takeover has improved the distribution ofBull's revenue base.andP;  Bull has merged all its microcomputer activities withZDS, and the enlarged company now generates 30% of its revenues in the UnitedStates (compared with a pretakeover 16%).andP;  Bull paid an agreed purchase priceof almost $500 million for ZDS, but a subsequent reduction in estimates ofthe company's net worth led it to reclaim some $50 million from ZenithElectronics Corp., ZDS' parent company.andM;The capital of Compagnie des Machines Bull (CMB), Groupe Bull's parentcompany, was increased by a further Fr965 million ($151.3 million) in 1989,most of it contributed by the French government.andP;  The capital of Bull's U.S.andO;subsidiary, Bull HN Information Systems Inc., was raised by $100 million,which was contributed by CMB and NEC Corp.andM;Bull's commitment to UNIX was rewarded early in 1989, when it became thefirst vendor to be certified by the X/open Group for its SPIX operatingsystem and DPX 2000 range of systems.andP;  Along with announcing new models andfunctionalities for its DPX 2000 series, Bull introduced a new UNIX system,the DPx/2, and the DPS 6000 series of departmental systems running both UNIXand GCOS 6.andP;  And Bull licensed Sunnyvale, Calif.based MIPS Computer SystemsInc.'s reduced instruction set computing (RISC) technology for its high-endUNIX systems.andM;Bull also picked up some valuable contracts for its mainframes in 1989.andO;ElfAquitaine in France added a second DPS 90 to its Grenoble site; theMichigan Department of Social Services ordered one DPS 90 system worth $20million; and General Electric Co. signed a $53 million deal for five DPS 90s,nine DPS 9000s and five DPS 8000s.andM;Whether Bull sustains greatness in the market depends on former managingdirector Francis Lorentz, now chairman and chief executive officer of thefirm.andP;  He replaces Jacques Stern, the great architect of Bull's return fromthe brink of disaster between 1982 and 1989, who left in june 1989 to launcha supercomputer venture.andM;SIEMENS AG Wittelsbacherplatz 2 D-8000 Munich 2, West Germany(49-89)-234-0000andM;Siemens AG shook up the industry in 1989 with its decision to snap uplong-term local rival Nixdorf Computer AG.andP;  The acquisition was announced onthe heels of a difficult year for Nixdorf, which reported a shart downturn inrevenue growth, compounded by heavy losses in orders.andP;  The merger, however,will not be formally completed until this fall.andM;The new Siemens-Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG concern will have DM16.6billion ($8.8 billion) in IS revenues.andP;  With 51 % ownership, Siemens willgain the foothold it needs to build up its market presence throughoutEurope--especially in France, Spain and the United Kingdom.andP;  By acquiringNixdorf's customer base, Siemens will gain more retailers and banks.andO;Nixdorf, in turn, may benefit from Siemens' strengths in computer-aideddesign and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), not to mention its financial reserves.andM;Siemens reported total revenues for 1989 of Dm61.1 billion ($32.5 billion).andO;The Communications and Information Systems division, which consists of threegroups-Data and Information Systems, Private Communications Systems andPeripherals and Terminals-reported moderate growth of about 3% due in part tothe success of Siemens' newly expanded BS2000 product line.andM;In telecommunications, Siemens struck out into new territory by purchasingSanta Clara-based Rolm Systems from IBM.andP;  Rolm Systems handles manufacturingand development, while a joint venture between Siemens and IBM, ROLM Co. ofNorwalk, Conn., handles sales and services.andM;Several factors caused Nixdorf's weak performance  in  1989.andP;  Publicly,Nixdorf's chief executive, Horst Nasko, blames negative press for thecompany's drop in revenues to DM5.25 billion  $0.8 billion) and its 15%decline in orders.andP;  Privately, he says decentralized planning was the causeof he shortfall.andP;  Nasko, who has been head of the company since Klaus Luftresigned in November, also acknowledges that Nixdorf's overdue switch fromits proprietary systems to standard solutions took &quot;an appreciable toll interms of time and expense.&quot;andM;Despite  the  firm's  difficulties, Nixdorf's telecommunications businessflourished last year.andP;  Revenues in that sector increased some 35% to Dm250million ($132 million) in 1989.andP;  Nixdorf also celebrated the success of itsIntegrated Services Digital Network  ISDN)-capable terminals.andP;  And thecompany made a massive effort to underline its competence as a systemsintegrator for its traditional customer base.andP;  Nixdorf upgraded itsUNIX-based Targon computers as well as introducing several new applications,PCs made to run on MS-DOS and UNIX and a new line of self-service equipment.andM;Siemens-Nixdorf will also implement a program set up at the end  ?1989 byNixdorf-independent of the merger--to significantly improve profitability in1990.andP;  The plan includes reducing unprofitable activities such as CAD/CAM,decreasing personnel and increasing the firm's concentration on software andservices.andM;While Nixdorf merely planned a restructure in 1989, Siemens transformed itsovergrown bureaucracies into 15 lean business units.andP;  Siemens' chiefexecutive Karlheinz Kaske says these units give the company &quot;new flexibilityto react quickly to rash changes in the industry as well as the trend towardglobal markets.&quot; The reorganization apparently enabled the company to launchan aggressive joint acquisition with London's General Electric Co. of U.K.andO;defense contractor Plessey Co. PLC.andP;  The maneuver will give Siemens controlof Plessey's communications divisions in a joint venture known as GEC PlesseyTelecommunications Holdings Ltd.andM;ING.andP;  C. OLIVETTI andamp; CO. SPA Via G. Jervis, 77 10015 Ivrea, Italy (39-125)-525andM;After two years of diminishing profits, Olivetti suffered another sharp dropin earnings in the 1989 calendar year: profits plunged 43% to L202.8 billion$147.8 million).andP;  The problem wasn't sales.andP;  Total group revenues rose 7.4%to L9.03 trillion ($6.6 billion), while is revenues in particular advanced by8.2% to L7.65 trillion ($5.6 billion).andM;A dismal showing in 1988, when profits were down 11.4%, led the group toundertake a major 1989 restructuring.andP;  It reorganized into fourdivisions-Olivetti Systems and Networks, Olivetti Office, OlivettiInformation Services and Olivetti Technologies Group.andP;  Earnings were already40%-down in the  first half of 1989, which chairman Carlo de Benedettiattributed to the cost of that restructuring.andM;But earnings took a further beating in 1989 because of fierce competition inOlivetti's main sector of activity, micros.andP;  Micro sales were up I 0% to L2.1trillion, ($1.5 billion), accounting for 27% of is revenues, nearly the sameas 1988.andP;  Mainframe sales fell 13% to L145 billion ($105 million) in 1989,slipping to less than 2% of total is sales.andM;In October 1989, Olivetti became the first major vendor to introduce a Pcbased on Intel Corp.'s i486 chip when it announced the CP486 computingplatform for its new generation  of micros.andP;  For its PCs, the company iscommitted to the Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA), although ithas not abandoned IBM's Micro Channel Architecture (MCA).andM;The new platform might help Olivetti improve its lackluster performance inthe European micro market, where in terms of unit value it lost its No.andP;  2position to Compaq Computer Corp. in 1988.andP;  Olivetti's market share plungedfrom 13 to 7.6% between 199-5 and 1988, while Compaq's rose to 9.5%.andM;Olivetti remains particularly strong in banking  systems, and in 1989 a bankawarded the company the largest contract in Olivetti's history.andP;  The Dutchco-operative banking federation Rabobank, which comprises 900 banks and 2,200offices in the Netherlands, placed an order worth L500 billion ($364 million)for a complete banking system including 2,000 LSX minis  (running underOlivetti's version of UNIX, x/os) and 25,000 PB workstations  first runningMS-DOS and, later, os/2).andP;  The system will be based around Olivetti's OpenSystems Architecture (OSA).andM;Although its five-year alliance with ATandamp;T ended in 1989, Olivetti continuedcooperating with other vendors throughout the year.andP;  A technology exchangedeal with Digital Equipment Corp., allowing Olivetti Pcs to be integratedinto Digital networks, was followed in April by an agreement allowing Digitalto market Olivetti Pcs in Europe.andM;NV PHILIPS GL 5621 BA Eindhoven The Netherlands (31-40)-79111andM;Although the information technology and communications business of NV PhilipsGL performed better than the company overall in 1989, slumping computer salescontributed to a disastrous start for the company in 1990.andP;  So bad, in fact,was Philips' first quarter performance this year-when earnings from coreoperations totaled only G6 million, down from G223 million in first threemonths of 1989-that two top executives are being forced to resign theirpositions at the company, effective next month.andM;Departing from Philips are Cornelius van der Klugt, president, and GertLorenz, who had headed up its computer business.andP;  just weeks before Philipsannounced its first-quarter results, van der Klugt had been predicting animprovement in his company's profitability for 1990.andP;  Philips' management nowbelieves it will be difficult to derive more income from existing operationsin 1990 than the company did in 1989.andM;For 1989, total revenues for Philips edged up a meager 2% to G57.2 billion$2-6.7 billion).andP;  Operating income fell 5.5% to G2.29 billion ($1.1 billion), but net income rose 30% to GI.37 million ($647.8 million).andP;  Thecompany's information technology (IT) business posted better performancerecords than the firm's averages, boosting sales by 8% to G5.97 billion ($2.8billion) in 1989, although the strengthened dollar gave Philips virtuallyflat sales when measured in U.S.currency.andM;Peripherals remained by far the largest single IT category for Philips,generating 33.1% of that sector's revenues, slightly more than in 1988.andO;Microcomputers again recorded the fastest sales growth, soaring 44% to G940million ($443 million).andP;  Minicomputer sales, in contrast, slumped nearly 15%to G750 million ($353  million).andP;  The contributions of data communicationsequipment and maintenance services were more or less stable at 16.2% and14.1%, respectively.andM;Earnings from IT sales, however, were poor in 1989, and at the beginning of1990 this business was reorganized into three separate divisions-informationsystems, communication systems and applications software-to enable eachdivision to cater more specifically to its particular market.andM;Building on its buoyant micro business, Philips was one of the first vendorsto launch a Pc based on Intel Corp.'s 33-megahertz 386 TM chip.andP;  Announced inMay of 1989 and dubbed the P3370, the Pc was shipped last fall.andP;  Thishigh-end micro supports a variety of operating environments, with MS-DOS 4.0as standard and os/2, Presentation Manager, LAN Manager, Microsoft Windowsand Novell NetWare optional.andP;  At the mini level, Philips extended its P9000UNix-based family with a high-end P9600, which has four times the power ofthe previous high-end model and is designed to handie up to 150 workstations.andM;In office automation applications, Philips launched a new low-cost opticalstorage system and its first case-handling application during 1989.andP;  TheMegadoc family of optical-filing systems was enlarged with the entry levelMegadoc-10.andP;  Designed for low-volume document storage and retrieval in smallworking groups within banks, insurance companies and government, it has acapacity of 16,000 pages per disk.andP;  Philips' new Documan applicationelectronically creates, stores, routes, monitors and controls access to casefolders.andP;  Philips is also the main contractor for a European Communityproject that is developing a case-handling system for the insurance industry.andM;NIXDORF COMPUTER AG Furstenallee 7 D-4790 Paderborn, West Germany(49)-525-1150andM;Nixdorf Computer AG may be enjoying its last year as a separately listedcompany in the DATAMATION 100.andP;  If all goes according to plan, Nixdorf soonwill be a part of Siemens AG-the result of a merger proposed last year, onein which Nixdorf strugged.andM;Nixdorf's information systems revenues in 1989 fell nearly 2% to DM5.25billion ($2.8 billion).andP;  For details on what happened to West Germany's No.andO;2 computer maker, please see our profile on Siemens.andM;STC PLC 1B Portland Place London WIN 3AA, U.K.andP;  (44-01) 323-1000andM;When STC posted profits in 1989 of [Br pound] 278.2 million  ($456.7million), 10% higher than expected, it should have been welcome news.andP;  But itwasn't.andP;  Instead, the company's shares dropped slightly in London, whereanalysts credited the higher figure to the company taking a pension fundholiday, which contributed [Br pound]36 million ($59 million) to the profitaccount.andM;But the initial reaction may have been hasty.andP;  STC chairman Arthur Walshchose not to give the windfall to shareholders; instead, he pumped thatmoney, along with a lot more, into research and development.andP;  The Randamp;D budgetrose nearly a third f 271 million  $4,f3.2 million), with particular emphasison optical communications and computing.andM;Among STC's IT divisions, operating profits rose handsomely for thecommunications operations (26%) and for the components and distributiondivision (52%).andP;  For the eighth consecutive year, operating profits rose atInternational Computers Ltd. (ICL), STC's information systems subsidiary.andO;ICL rated third of STC's IT divisions, with a 13% increase in profits to [Brpound]145.7 million ($238.3 million), on revenues of [Br pound]1.6 billion($2.6 billion, up 18%), with more than 60% of sales coming from the UnitedKingdom.andP;  The increase, however, was no mean feat these days, particularly asincreases in inflation and interest rates in the United Kingdom have squeezedthe margins of hardware products.andM;Still, many questions remain over ICL's future, as STC continues to look forpotential partners.andP;  The parent company wants to help share research costs atICL, whose appeal was certainly enhanced with the $168 million acquisition ofCalifornia-based Computer Consoles (now ICL North America).andM;Internally, ICL moved to hold down product costs by reducing itsmanufacturing and logistics operations in the United Kingdom from four sitesto three.andP;  And in March 1990, ICL reshuffled its Mainframe, Office, Networkand Software Services Units into three new divisions: Computer Products, ITServices and Systems Integration.andP;  The company says the shift signals itsmove from a &quot;box supplier&quot; to a &quot;total solution provider.&quot;andM;Some 1989 investments enhance that ability.andP;  ICL Germany took a 40% shareholding in Metatech, a software house specializing in applications for themanufacturing sector.andP;  In the Netherlands, ICL established SIAC, a systemsand software house with 80 employees.andP;  ICL is operating in six EasternEuropean countries, including two joint ventures-one in the U.S.S.R.andP;  forassembling Pcs and another in Poland for the local assembly of ME29mainframes.andM;In january, ICL introduced  its DRS 6000 series, a new range of high-powered,midrange, UNIX-based systems, making ICL the first major internationalsupplier to combine Scaleable Processor Architecture (SPARC)-based reducedinstruction set computing (RISC) with the latest version of the UNIX SystemV.4 operating system.andP;  Even before the upgrade, the DRS series won somesignificant business in 1989, notably from the Spanish Ministry for SocialSecurity and fro- m the Portuguese government.andP;  Also this year, ICL plans tointroduce its most powerful Essex series mainframes, aimed at large userssuch as central governments and utilities.andP;  -Tim HarperandM;MEMOREX TELEX NV Hoogoorddreef 9 1101BA Amsterdam zo The Netherlands (31-20)974-331andM;With the 1988 merger of Memorex International of Amsterdam and Telex Corp. ofTulsa, Okla., well behind it, Memorex Telex NV began to look out at the worldagain in 1989.andP;  Although the company shipped I I new products in 1988, lastyear brought an even stronger emphasis on the company's storage andnetworking market strategies.andP;  Specifically, in 1989 the firm brought out aseries of new items, including a large capacity disk drive with a smallfootprint.andP;  IS revenues for calendar 1989 total  ed $2.05 billion.andM;Memorex says the two halves of its company have complementary product setsand a geographical spread that is beginning to show through.andP;  The mergercreated a company large enough to demand a global presence and acquire theresources needed to develop commercially successful new products.andP;  On the onehand, Memorex International earned 70% of its sales in Europe and only 30% inthe United States.andP;  For Telex Corp., on the other hand, the U.S.andP;  accountedfor 85% of sales.andP;  The merged range of products fits well together, as Telexadds vital networking products to Memorex's emphasis on peripherals for largeIBM machines.andM;The AS/400 peripherals market segment is expected to be strategic for thecompany, which released several products there in 1989.andP;  The company hopes tocapture 30% of the market within three years.andP;  New product introductionsinclude the 5460 cartridge reader, which holds up to I 0 cartridges (comparedwith IBM's 3490, which holds eight).andP;  The unit works with both AS/400 andSystem/38 machines, which makes it useful for sites planning staggeredupgrades or those running applications on both systems.andM;In October, the company started shipping its new IBM 3380-compatible 3890disk drives and its robotics-based automated tape library.andM;Another important 1989 product release was the 1174 series of remotecontrollers, which can hook up to four host machines and 96 coax devices.andO;Manufactured at Memorex Telex's factory in Raleigh, N.C., the controllersshould be &quot;of key importance to our customers' networking strategies,&quot; saysthe company spokesman.andM;Memorex Telex made some strides in 1989 as a supplier of software forvalue-added networks.andP;  One such order was to supply workstations, softwareand service for Galileo, the air travel reservation system being developed bya consortium of European airlines including British Airways and KLM.andP;  Galileopromises to be one of Europe's largest value-added network applications.andM;ALCATEL NV 33 Rue Emeriau 75015 Paris, France (33-1)-40-58-58-58andM;The enlarged, but more specialized Alcatel NV, created from the merger of theinformation technology and telecommunications activities of France'sCompagnie Generale d'Electricite (CGE) and ITT Corp.'s worldwidetelecommunications interests, completed its first three years of operation atthe end of 1989 on a buoyant note.andM;After a slight decline in revenues in 1988, Alcatel achieved a 15% increasein 1989 to European Currency Unit 12.8 billion ($14.1 billion), and netincome jumped 43% to ECU478 million ($526 million).andP;  (Alcatel is registeredas a Dutch company and uses the European Currency Unit for accountingpurposes.) Net margins thus rose from 3.2 to 4.andP;  1 % in 1988.andP;  Marginsimproved despite restructuring costs of EdU223.5 million ($246 million), asharp increase, practically as much as the costs for the previous two yearscombined.andP;  More than 80% of Alcatel's 1989 revenues came from Europe, withover 28% coming from France alone.andP;  North America chipped in 5.8%, and therest of the world contributed 12.5% of revenues.andM;The company's four main operating divisions were partially reorganized at theend of 1989, the principal move being to broaden the Transmission SystemsDivision (which generated 14% of sales in 1989) to form theRadiocommunications, Space and Defense Group.andM;As for the other three units, the Network Systems Group contributed 25% ofsales in 1989, Business Systems accounted for 21% and Cables, 28%.andP;  Theremaining 12% of 1989 sales came from professional electronics and otheractivities.andM;Alcatel's strategy is to offer complete network and systems solutionsencompassing voice, data, text and image.andP;  To that end, it pursues technicalalliances that widen its markets and reinforce its product line.andP;  In 1989,the firm's French telephone equipment and business systems subsidiary, TelicAlcatel, and IBM France agreed to develop a service and communications bridgebetween their respective equipment.andP;  Alcatel and Siemens AG also announcedcommon specifications for inter-PABX (private automatic branch exchange)signalling in private Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDNs).andM;Alcatel secured the rights to manufacture and distribute the high-speed localarea network (LAN) switches and software of QPSX Communications of Perth,Australia.andP;  Telic Alcatel also signed a 10-year agreement with theCairo-based Egyptian Telephone Corp., providing for ETC to manufacture theAlcatel 2600 PABX.andM;NOKIA DATA AB P.O. Box 226 SF-00101 Helsinki, Finland (358-0) 180-71andM;Nokia, the highly aggressive Finnish conglomerate, once again has failed topresent convincing evidence that its efforts in the computer business will beultimately successful.andP;  Sales of the data division in 1989 totaled 5.1billion Finnish markka (about $1.2 billion), up only 5% over 1988, but thedivision managed to break even, at least ac management.andM;When Nokia acquired and merged the Data Division of the Swedishtelecommunications giant LM Ericsson Telephone Co. in January 1988, with itsown data operations, observers were skeptical.andP;  Ericsson had struggled forseveral years to try to make the division profitable, but had failedcompletely.andM;Nokia, however, has managed to halt the bleeding, creating a data divisionwith a strong position on the Scandinavian market, particularly in bankingand insurance.andP;  Nokia Data concentrates on packaged solutions of bothhardware and software, which are of its own development and manufacture.andP;  Itsstrategy is similar to that of other small makers: open systems, systemsintegration and a solutions orientation.andM;Compared internationally, Nokia is a small hardware producer.andP;  In fact, inproducing minicomputers, Pcs and terminals, the firm is more an assemblerthan a manufacturer.andP;  But management insists that being large is notnecessarily an advantage.andP;  In Scandinavia, for instance, Nokia'sIBM-compatible Pcs sell well, due mainly to excellent ergonomics.andM;To sell its technology, Nokia divides it business geographically: Finland,Scandinavia and the rest of Europe.andP;  The home market, Finland, accounts for40% of sales.andP;  Nokia Data also is an agent for other companies' products inFinland, in cluding Hitachi Ltd. mainframes.andP;  Market shares are very high;Nokia is Finland's great hope in high tech, and national chauvinism helpsmaintain strong sales.andP;  Even in Scandinavia, which accounts for 30% of sales,Nokia has a relatively large market share.andP;  In Sweden, Nokia is thesecond-largest hardware supplier after IBM.andP;  The picture is completelydifferent in the rest of Europe, where Nokia Data has small mar shares andpoor profitability.andM;Nokia Data could be an ideal partner or acquisition candidate for aninternational computer company that wants to strengthen its market positionin Scandinavia.andP;  There have been unconfirmed reports that Olivetti isnegotiating to acquire Nokia or will work out some kind of cooperativeagreement.andP;  These rumors started when Olivetti's former vice president,Vittorio Levi, was named managing director of Nokia Data, to succeed KalleIsokallio as of January 1, 1991.andM;CAP GEMINI SOGETI 11 Rue de Tilsit 75017 Paris, France (33-1)-47-54-50-00andM;Except for absorbing five small firms specializing in information systems in1989, Cap Gemini Sogeti concentrated on consolidating and streamlining itsorganization last year, significantly improving its profitability.andP;  Thebreather was necessary for the group to complete its merger with SESA, theFrench service company it took control of in late 1987.andM;As a result, group revenues increased by 21.2% to Fr7.04 billion ($1.1billion), up from Fr5.8 billion ($976 million) in 1988, while net earningssurged by over 30% to Fr525 million ($82.3 million), up from Fr402 million($67.5 million).andP;  Net margins thus jumped to a record 7.4% from an alreadyhealthy 6.9% in 1988.andP;  At the same time, the company raised additionalfunding of Fr1.5 billion ($235.1 million) through an issue of 10-yearconvertible bonds.andM;France again accounted for 46% of Cap Gemini's revenues, while other Europeancountries contributed 34% (down from 38% in 1988).andP;  The United States chippedin with 19%, up slightly, mainly because of the stronger dollar and some U.S.andO;acquisitions.andP;  The company's four main sectors of activity-industry, financeand banking, distribution and services, and telecommunications-each generatedat least 20% of revenues, while government (including defense) accounted foraround 15%.andM;Of the five small is firms absorbed in 1989, two are in the United States:Systemation Inc. of Cleveland, which is strong in systems integration, andMerit Systems Inc., a Detroit service company specializing in industrial is.andO;The takeovers added annual revenues of $40 million, boosting Cap GeminiAmerica's revenues to 1230 million in 1989.andP;  In Europe, Cap Gemini acquired asmall Swedish firm, Accept Data, based in Stockholm, which develops financialsystems, and two French firms, Apsis and Aptor, both based near Grenoble,specializing in industrial systems.andM;Within the company's existing organization, its Italian subsidiaries had aparticularly good year in 1989.andP;  Milan-based Cap Gemini Geda picked upcontracts from the new Milan airport; the Italian national railway, Ferroviedello Stato; and from the city of Rome for a town-planning database andmanagement system.andP;  Rome-based SESA Italia (now Cap Gemini Italia) wasawarded a systems integration contract for the European space shuttle projectHermes.andP;  Elsewhere in Europe, the Royal Dutch Navy retained Cap Gemini todevelop a complete stock control and procurement system, while a Swedishhydroelectric  power consortium contracted Cap Gemini's Swedish subsidiary,Cap Gemini Logic, to develop a system for power distribution management.andM;In preparation for the unified European market, Cap Gemini Logic and CapGemini Pandata, the firm's Dutch operation, were reorganized in 1989 bymerging several subsidiaries into single vertically structured units in eachcountry.andP;  In February 1990, Cap Gemini also established an internationalsupport group in Paris.andM;Finally, responding to the demands of its customers, Cap Gemini has begun todiversify into more general corporate consulting with the acquisition injanuary 1990 of a 67.5% holding in Gamma International, a Paris-basedmanagement consulting firm.andM;MANNESMANN KIENZLE GMBH Postfach 16 40 7730 vs-Villigen West Germany(49-7721)-671andM;1989 is the year Mannesmann Kienzle GmbH stopped merely supportingstandards-based systems and started to push them.andP;  At least that's what onecompany spokesman says.andP;  The goal was a smooth transition betweenMannesmann's proprietary operating systems, MTOS and UNIX.andP;  The means was itsfirst UNIX-based business system series, the 2000, which formed a bridgebetween the company's 9000 family and &quot;the world of UNIX.&quot;andM;To focus attention on its new solution, the company increased promotion ofits Kienzle Integrated Digital Area Network (KIDAN), a local area network(LAN) that enables communication between the 9000 and 2000, as well as othersystems.andP;  Mannesmann also introduced 15 new application software packages forthe building, trade and service industries last year.andM;Revenues totaled DM 1.86 billion  $986 million) for calendar 1989.andP;  Followingthe restructuring that split the group into independent business divisions,Kienzle Computer Systems reported a 5.8% rise in revenue, Mannesmann Tally(printers) reported a 13.8% increase and Pcs Computer Systems reported a jumpof 19.3%.andP;  DATAMATION estimates Mannesmann's total IS sales in calendar 1989to be DM 1.5 billion ($818.6 million), a rise of 12% over 1988's figures.andM;In telecommunications, Mannesmann turned its attention to the IntegratedServices Digital Network (ISDN) and to finding ways to combine computers withtelephones.andP;  To that end, the company teamed up with Siemens AG in a venturecalled PBX and Computer Teaming (PaCT).andP;  PaCT's first task was connectingMannesmann terminals to computers using Siemens' Hicom private branchexchanges (PBXs)-a first step toward what Mannesmann calls computer-aidedtelephoning.andP;  To complement last year's developments, the company introduceda new line of fax machines that are compatible with the standards of theConsultative Committee on International Telephone and Telegraph (CCITT).andM;Mannesmann ended 1989 with an accent on mobile communications, winning theWest German Post Ministry license for the country's second pan-Europeandigital cellular communications network.andP;  Mannesmann's Dusseldorf-basedsubsidiary, Mannesmann Mobile Funk GmbH, heads the consortium, joined bypartners Pacific Telesis International, based in San Francisco, and Cable andWireless PLC in the United Kingdom.andP;  Mannesmann plans to install and marketservices by 1991.andM;AMSTRAD PLC Brentwood House 169 King's Road Brentwood, Essex cm 14 4EF, U.K.andO;(44-277) 228-888andM;In many ways, 1989 was another dismal year for Amstrad PLC, with acontinuation of the volume woes-sales too low, inventories too high-thatalways mean trouble for a marketing company.andP;  And Amstrad, whose businesscenters on Pc clones, has always insisted that it is a marketing company,rather than a technology company or even a computer company.andM;But 1989 may be regarded as the year that Amstrad and its mercurialfounder-chairman Alan Sugar, began to turn things around.andP;  After inventoriesclimbed to [Br pound]335 million ($548 million) and net borrowing rose to [Brpound] 114 million ($186 million) last autumn, Amstrad's shares slumped 82%on the London exchange.andP;  For the first time, Sugar admitted that Amstrad hadmade mistakes in virtually every aspect of its rapid expansion.andM;Several new executives came in to beef up the floundering senior management,led by a new group finance director, Peter Thoms.andP;  By early 1990, the companywas in a cash neutral position, and inventories had been sliced to a moreacceptable [Br pound]220 million ($360 million), with a goal of[Br pound]150million ($245 million) by the end of the year.andP;  And despite months ofsuffering rom  rising British interest rates, Amstrad's results for thesecond half of 1989 showed pretax profits of [Br pound]30 million ($49million), almost doubling analysts' expectations.andM;The company also brought new management into Spain, the United States andWest Germany.andP;  One mistake, Sugar said, was that a lack of cost monitoringand controls in those countries (which are now in place, he says) led him tooveremphasize revenue growth.andM;Sugar is pinning high hopes on a new venture with London-based STC PLC inBelfast, Northern Ireland, to produce a reliable, attractively priced telefaxmachine for the home and small office.andP;  The company formed two other majormanufacturing alliances during 1989, one with Marconi for satellite equipmentand another with GPT, part of GEC-Siemens, for its top-end 80396- and80286-based Pc 2000s.andP;  About 7,000 of those machines had to be recalledduring 1989 because of hard disk problems.andP;  To improve product quality andservice, Sugar's new managers will put more emphasis on research anddevelopment and will provide more direct support for end users.andM;Sixty percent of Amstrad's business is done abroad, but its efforts remainpatchy.andP;  The company is well pleased with its subsidiaries' performances inAustralia, Italy and West Germany, for instance, but has been disappointed inthe United States and is expecting a continued slide in Spain.andP;  EasternEurope is seen as a major potential market, led by a deal unveiled in early1990 to sell 40,000 PCs to the Soviet Union.andM;BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PLC 81 Newgate Street London ECI A 7Aj, U. K.andO;(44-1)-356-5000andM;British Telecommunications PLC is not generally known for the spectacular,but in 1989, British Telecom officials began taking a brash approach,seizing.andP;  every opportunity to demonstrate that it wants to become theworld's most successful  telecommunications company.andP;  Even amid the economicfluctuations and fears running through Britain in late 1989 and early 1990,its share prices rose, and British  Telecom lost its reputation for being anundervalued stock.andM;The market may have perceived that the company  is a bit closer to its statedgoal due to a pair of major acquisitions made during 1989.andM;The  company  purchased Tymnet's network systems  business and its associatedapplications  from McDonnell Douglas Corp. for $355 million.andP;  BT's worldwidenetwork systems and network applications business, which accounted for some[Br pound]220 million ($360 million) in 1989 revenues, is now being run bythe wholly owned British Telecom subsidiary BT Tymnet Inc. in San Jose.andP;  Thesecond significant acquisition was a 20% stake in McCaw Cellular for $1.37billion.andP;  McCaw's ownership or interest in 130-some cellular telephoneoperations throughout the United States gives British Telecom the opportunityto build its long-dreamed-of national cellular network in the United States.andM;In 1989, British Telecom also entered a joint venture with OTC Australia.andO;The new company, Network Innovations PLC, will manage the OTC Dialcom publicelectronic ma4,1 service, as well as develop, market and support othervalue-added services in Australia.andM;At home, fierce  competition from Mercury Communications Ltd., which isexpanding its services from long-distance to pay phone calls, is a naggingissue.andP;  The increased competition has caused BT executives to be quite vocalin criticizing the U.K.andP;  government's regulatory policies.andP;  While BT applaudsthe ideals of those policies, which it calls the most open in the world, itcomplains that the regulations are hurting the company both domestically andabroad.andM;BT is also reviewing its position as a private branch exchange (PBX)manufacturer.andP;  In January 1990, British Telecom announced that it might sellall or part of its 51% shareholding in the Mitel Corp.andP;  The disclosuredemonstrated that BT Toes not see PBX manufacturing as an essential part ofits global network services strategy.andM;British Telecom's major growth markets will be in mobile  communications anddata communications, including two international paging operations:Metrocast, which is already operating in the United Kingdom and UnitedStates, and Euromessage, which was scheduled for a Spring 1990 launch inFrance, Italy, the United Kingdom and West Germany.andP;  And, although thecompany is saying little about it, analysts believe a key part of the 1990strategy is to chase the 20% of TELEMEX being offered by the Mexicangovernment.andM;Along with the business changes and expansions, British Telecom is hoping toimprove its image of poor quality service by modernizing the phone system.andO;Analysts believe one potential roadblock to accomplishing this is the highcost of giving its engineers pay raises of perhaps 10%.andP;  In March, 1990, thecompany announced a restructuring that could result in a loss of 10,000employees over the next three years.andM;FINSIEL SPA Via Isonzo, 21 /B 00198 Rome, Italy (39-6)-851505andM;Finsiel SpA  Finanziaria per i Sistemi Informativi Elettronic;), Europe'ssecond-largest software company, is taking an active part in Euromethod, theEuropean Community project aimed at defining standard software developmentmethodologies.andP;  Finsiel is already a key player in this effort through thedistribution of its Dafne methodology and various computer-aided softwareengineering (CASE) tools.andM;In 1989, Finsiel also looked beyond Europe.andP;  Through its research anddevelopment group, Tecsiel, Finsiel has taken another step towardstandardization by cooperating with groups espousing standards, such asx/open Co. Ltd. Tecsiel has also signed agreements with Fort Lee, N.J.-basedOn-Line Software International Inc. and France's TITN-Alcatel to encouragethe global distribution of its software packages.andP;  Finsiel also signed anagreement with the U.S.S.R.andP;  State Committee for Computers and InformationSciences for joint development of application and systems software.andM;Finsiel's 1989 revenues rose 28% to [Br pound]908.7 billion ($662.5 million).andO;To boost Finsiel's future prospects, the state-owned Instituto RiconstruzioneIndustriale, Finsiel's major investor, increased its investment in thecompany, boosting capital to L52 billion  $38 million).andM;RACAL ELECTRONICS PLC Western Road Bracknell, Berkshire RG 12 1RG, U.K.andO;(44-344) 481-222andM;In 1989, Racal focused on expanding its technology base and continued itsmove away from hardware production into systems, managed networks and networkservices-a strategy the company plans to pursue at least for the next severalyears.andP;  Sales of Racal data communications products rose 12.7% in 1989 to [Brpound]350.9 million ($574 million).andM;Last year, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher inaugurated theGovernment Data Network, a Racal-managed service for the U.K.andP;  government,which was the centerpiece of a 10-year, $510 million contract Racal won in1988.andP;  As part of a follow-on to that network, Racal Data Networks Ltd., asubsidiary of the Racal Data Communications Group, is in discussions with theU.K.andP;  government for an integrated voice and data service.andP;  Another 1988contract, for a managed voice service for the U.K.andP;  Department of SocialServices, went live in September 1989.andP;  And a new contract for CommunicationsGroup went to Sunrise, Fla.-based network systems supplier Racai-Milgo forthe communications infrastructure of the Channel Tunnel project.andM;For these and other projects, the technologies that will drive the company inthe 1990s include high bandwidth local area networks, internetworking, highbandwidth circuit and packet switching, open systems standards, full-servicenetwork management, voice-data integration and Integrated Services DigitalNetworks (ISDN).andP;  Racal's ability to expand into these technology markets wasbolstered last year by a trio of acquisitions: the DCA Network CommunicationsGroup (being merged with Racal-Milgo), specializing in TI digitalcommunications and OSI network management; Quanta Communications Systems Inc.andO;(now trading as Racal Quanta), a fiber optics communications company; andInterlan Inc. (now trading as Racal Interlan), a leading U.S.andP;  local areanetwork company.andM;The United States remains Racal's biggest source  of revenue, but Europe isthe fastest  growing market.andP;  Racal's home market, the United Kingdom,accounts for 23% of its total worldwide sales.andM;Among the moves designed to improve its internal organization, Racalconsolidated all its U.S.andP;  manufacturing, including that of Racal-Milgo andits Racal-Vadic modem maker, at a single site in Miani.andM;Racal believes the factors most critical to its future success includefirst-class distribution channels, product cost reductions, innovation andeffective network services.andM;COMPAREX INFORMATIONS-SYSTEME GMBH Gottlieb-Daimler-Strasse 10 D-6800Mannheim 1, West Germany (49-621)-40090andM;A  decrease in the demand for compatible mainframes resulted in continuedprice decreases.andP;  This, compounded by problems in disk storage systemdeliveries, kept Comparex Infonmtions-systeme GmbH's revenues for 1989 downto DM1.06 billion ($566 million)-about 1.5% below the previous year'sfigures.andM;Speculation concerning the Hitachi Ltd. takeover of National Advanced SystemsCorp.-a major competitor of Comparex in Europe-fueled speculation about howthat acquisition would affect products Hitachi supplied to Comparex inEurope.andP;  That speculation had a negative effect on Comparex's sales.andM;However, chairman of the board Rolf Brillinger calls the firm's 3% earningson revenue satisfactory, adding that such figures show that Comparex &quot;isthoroughly sound and has proved it can hold its position even againstextremely tough competition.&quot;andM;Comparex West Germany contributed the most to total corporate revenues withDM482 million ($256 million), although its growth remained static.andP;  OtherEuropean subsidiaries reported increases in their market shares, withBelgium, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland all recordingdouble-digit growth.andP;  The firm's work force rose 2% in 1989 to 1, 145employees worldwide, as a result of increased sales by the subsidiaries.andO;Sales to partnership companies, however, decreased by 15% in 1989 to DMI53million ($81 million), due to a limited availability of Comparex's products.andM;Over half of Comparex's sales are peripherals.andP;  Comparex's 3090-classmainframes accounted for 32% of domestic revenues, and services chipped in16%.andM;Particularly high demand for disk storage systems and a holdup of theirdelivery from Hitachi produced a backlog of orders that couldn't becompletely made up in the second half of the year ever, despite thesesetbacks, Brillinger says he expects sales of 3090-class CPUs, peripheralsand service products to increase in the 1990s.andP;  Sales for  those goods, hesays, will get a shot in the arm from increased trade with Eastern Europe andan eventual change in the rules set by the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral  Export  Controls (COCOM).andM;SD-SCICON PLC Centrum House 10 1- 1 03 Fleet Road Fleet, Hampshire GU 1 3 8NZU.K.andP;  (44-252)-622-161andM;SD-Scicon, born out of the 1988 merger of two British software houses,Systems Designers and Scicon International, focused in 1989 on assimilatingthe two companies and defining the principal markets for the new, combinedcompany.andP;  In that first full year of operation, SD-Scicon realized isrevenues of [Br pound]263.8 million ($431.5 million), up 28% over 1988.andP;  Thecombined company was inaugurated formally in january 1990, with PhilipSwinstead as chairman and lan Scoggins and Geoff Holmes as joint chiefexecutive officers.andM;SD-Scicon has decided to concentrate on Europe.andP;  It will not pull out of theUnited States completely; its vehicle-emission testing programs are used bymany states.andP;  However, the company sees itself as a niche player and says itsresources are not suited to a market as vast and competitive as the UnitedStates.andP;  But Europe seems more manageable and, with the democratization ofEastern Europe and the prospect of fewer trade barriers in 1993, appears tooffer much more growth potential.andM;One result of the decision to stay close to home was SD-Scicon's early 1990sale of Warrington Financial Services, a U.S.andP;  on-line bond-tradingconsulting company, to another U.S.andP;  firm, Sungard Data Systems Inc. ofWayne, Pa.andP;  The $65.3 million Warrington sale provided E24 million ($39million) in after-tax capital that can be used to finance further expansionin Europe.andP;  Part of that expansion may be some sort of alliance with Sligosof France; SD-Scicon will say only that the two companies are in wide-rangingdiscussions.andM;Internally, one of the most notable aspects of SD-Scicon is the company'scommitment, from the chairman's office on down, to a  total qualitymanagement&quot; program.andP;  While many companies dabble in these programs,SD-Scicon's top people seem determined to make it stick over however manyyears it takes to build an infrastructure of quality-oriented managementgeared toward making the right decisions the first time.andM;In Europe, SD-Scicon sees the 1993 drive toward harmonization asopportunities for that new business, both for its technical products andprofessional services.andP;  In products, expected growth areas include facilitiesmanagement, particularly in plant maintenance and manufacturing applications,and in communications, particularly the X.400 market.andP;  In professionalservices, the company sees itself becoming more in demand for both systemsintegration and turnkey projects.andM;SLIGOS 3 Place de la Pyramide Cedex 49 92067 Paris La Defense, France(33-1)-49-00-90-00andM;Sligos, France's second largest computer services company, enters theDATAMATION 100 after another year of healthy revenue and earnings growth.andP;  Itdid not have far to go, since in 1988 it was in 101st place worldwide, afterrecording a 46.2%jump in revenue  mainly due to acquisitions) to top the Fr2billion ($343 million) mark.andP;  Revenue advanced a further 25% in calendar 1989to about Fr2.6 billion ($401 million), while aftertax earnings were up about36% to Frl 34 million ($21 million).andP;  Net margins were thus restored to 5.3%following a dip to 4.85% in 1988.andM;Although Sligos has been a publicly quoted company since 1986, it iscontrolled by one of France's big four banks, Credit Lyonnais, which retainsa 62.8% holding in the company.andP;  That partly explains the importance of thefinancial sector in Sligos' total business: banking systems, electronicpayment processing and ancillary services account for 36% of revenues.andO;However, systems engineering, including industrial systems, remains thebiggest activity, generating 46% of revenues (27% from large systems and 19%from microcomputers).andP;  The remainder comes from customized software packagesfor small and medium-sized companies (10%) and value-added services (8%).andM;For all of its strength in banking and electronic payments, Sligos had nodirect presence in West Germany up until its acquisition in 1989 of a 70%holding in Stuttgart-based Actis, which specializes in banking systems andelectronic data interchange especially for the automobile industry) and hadrevenues of DM27 million ($14.4 million) in 1989.andM;With the takeover of Actis, the proportion of Sligos' revenues derived fromoutside France has more than doubled, to around 9%.andP;  The company also ownsthe Spanish company Poli-Rub, based in Barcelona; has a 60% stake in CortramSystems Ltd. of Valhalia, N.Y.; and a 70% stake in subsidiary Sligos Coted'Ivoire, based in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.andM;By 1993, when it expects 15 to 20% of its revenues to come from outsideFrance, Sligos hopes to double its revenues to Fr5 billion (about $785million).andP;  To help it expand its operations elsewhere in Europe, the firm hasentered into an informal alliance with the U.K.'s biggest service company,SD-Scicon PLC.andP;  No shares have changed hands, but the two are exploringavenues that would enable both to cater more effectively to the Europeanmarket.andM;SEMA GROUP PLC 22 Long Acre London WC2E 9Ly, U.K.andP;  (44-1)-379-4711andM;At the end of his first year at the helm of this Anglo-French software andservices company, managing  director Pierre Bonelli was able to a 35.7% jumpin pretax earnings to [Br pound]17.5 million  $28.6 million) on a 9.8%increase in revenues to [Br pound] 293 million ($479 million).andP;  Sema GroupPLC's 1989 information systems revenues in particular were up 8.4% to [Brpound]228.5 million ($374 million).andM;As in 1988, almost 90% of Sema's Is revenue last year came from systemsengineering and integration, with the rest coming from facilities management.andO;The market breakdown was also unchanged from the year before: banking andfinance generated 24%; manufacturing 21 %; defense and aerospace 15%;nonfinancial services I 0%; energy, transportation and government 8% each;and telecommunications 6%.andM;France again accounted for 41 % of the company's revenues, while the Britishshare fell to 37% from 40% in 1988.andP;  A further 8% came from Spain, 6% fromBelgium, 5% from the rest of Europe (essentially West Germany and theNetherlands) and 3% from the rest of the world (North America and Singapore).andM;Bonelli restored margins at both the U.S.andP;  and Dutch operations byreorganizing senior management, setting more realistic revenue targets andinstituting tighter financial control and reporting systems.andP;  He alsoachieved his goal of expanding the company's activities in West Germany inDecember of 1989,  when Sema acquired a 50% holding in  leading Germansoftware company, ADV/Orga F.A.andP;  Meyer AG of Wilhelmshaven.andP;  ADV/ Orga lost ahefty DM14.2 million ($7.5 million) on sales of DM80 million ($42.5 million)in the year ended June 30,1989, but Sema has trimmed the firm's work forcefrom 600 to 500, and the scaled-down operation is expected to generaterevenues of DM60 million ($32 million) in 1990.andM;Further European expansion occurred in january 1996 when Sema's new Swisssubsidiary started operating in Geneva.andP;  The following month, Sema acquired a49% stake in a French financial systems company, Tibet, and took over Germanmarket research Emnid GmbH.andM;The largest slice of new business for Sema in 1989 was a $65 million contractfor the design and supply of command and control systems for the Royal Navy.andO;The company also signed a licensing agreement with Credit Card Software Inc.andO;of Orlando, Fla., early in 1989 for the exclusive marketing  rights to itsCardpac credit card processing system in Western Europe and the Far East.andM;NORSK DATA AS Olaf Helsetsvei 5 P.O.
