Manguno (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> JAPAN FREST </CO><IN> MIN MON </IN><DATELINE> KWANGYANG, South Korea  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Legend has it that in 1978, Deng Xiaoping asked Japan's Nippon Steel Corp. to build China a mill exactly like South Korea's Pohang Iron andamp; Steel Co. complex in Pohang.    Nippon Steel's then-chairman, Yosihiro Inayama, is said to have retorted: &quot;It won't do you any good unless China has a manager as good as Posco's chairman, Park Tae Joon, to run it.&quot;    The past decade has done nothing to harm the stature of either Posco, as Pohang Iron andamp; Steel is known, or Mr. Park, a retired general who the government plucked from obscurity more than 20 years ago and ordered to build a steel industry. Not only did he do that, but Posco intends to be one of the world's two largest steelmakers just two years from now.    Starting in 1968 without natural resources, funds, technology or experience, Mr. Park has built Posco into the biggest of South Korea's 17 steelmakers. Its sprawling mill complexes at Kwangyang on the southern coast and at Pohang on the east coast account for 90% of the nation's steel production.    Posco is already one of the world's major steel producers. Last year, its 19,000 employees produced 11.3 million metric tons of raw steel, enabling the company to post sales of $3.7 billion, up 37% from 1986, and net income of $89.1 million, up 21%, despite the fact that its prices are from 15% to 50% below those of its main competitors in Taiwan, the U.S. and Japan.    Posco is celebrating its 20th anniversary by becoming majority-owned by the public. Since the company's inception, the government had held 69%, but it is selling more than half its stake, mostly to Posco employees and small-scale investors.    By August, when another mill is scheduled to open in Kwangyang, Posco will be second in capacity only to Nippon Steel. And by 1990, Posco expects to be on a par with the Japanese steelmaker, the world's current leader.    &quot;There are many countries that want our assistance now,&quot; says Yi Dai Kong, managing director of Posco's main mill at Pohang. In 1986, for example, Posco formed a 50-50 joint venture with USX Corp. of the U.S. The venture, which is already making a profit, runs a steel mill in California. The mill's American workers were trained at Pohang.    But despite its success, company executives say Posco is at a crossroads. Not only is world-wide demand for steel in a slump, but Posco faces increasing protectionism in its main markets, Europe and the U.S. It must also deal with rising costs for raw materials, much of which must be imported and paid for with Korea's ever-stronger won. The Korean steelmaker must keep up with rapid technological changes in Japan and the U.S. And at home, it must deal with a more militant work force, the loss of state protection as the government gives up its majority interest, and a squeeze on new financing as Seoul tightens access to bank borrowing.    The company has tried to mitigate some of these problems. It shares technology with major steel concerns overseas, and is fighting to maintain price competitiveness overseas by holding down production costs. Posco is also seeking new markets in South Asia, Africa, Latin America -- and even Eastern Europe, which had for years shunned South Korea.    And the company is positioning itself to take advantage of a vast potential market -- China. Seoul and Beijing haven't any official relations, but China could become a buyer of Posco products as well as a supplier of raw materials. Posco currently imports all its raw iron and 95% of its coal from as far away as Australia, the U.S. and Canada.    Much of Posco's success is due to the obsessive leadership of Mr. Park, who 20 years ago defied the prevailing international view that impoverished South Korea couldn't support an industry as capital intensive as steel. And it was he, Posco officials say, who fought to protect the company from being swallowed by Korea's giant conglomerates.    Mr. Park says the best way to guarantee Posco's future is to embark on bold initiatives. He cites China's potential and adds that diversification is important. A recent Posco study urged the company to &quot;diversify . . . to more profitable areas&quot; in related and unrelated ventures.    &quot;We must seriously consider whether we can pay dividends to all our new shareholders with only steel products,&quot; Mr. Park says. &quot;We have to find other ways to survive independent of the demand for steel.&quot;    Posco officials acknowledge that diversification isn't popular with government economic planners, who have cautioned the company for years not to be too ambitious. They are concerned that the company doesn't have the financing to pay for its plans. &quot;Where will Posco get the money to expand and diversify?&quot; says an official of the Economic Planning Board. &quot;And what will be the cost to the Korean economy?&quot;    The official notes that Posco already plans to borrow as much as $2.5 billion to fund its expansion at Kwangyang at a time when the government is pressuring all businesses to curb bank loans. Posco could have trouble repaying the $1.2 billion it already owes, the state official says, because while demand for steel declines, the company must continue exporting at least 30% of production to earn the foreign exchange to service its debt.    Mr. Park and fellow executives respond that while exports are slowing, domestic demand is so strong that Korea's steel companies can't increase production fast enough to keep pace. Company officials also note that of the total $2.93 billion borrowed from abroad since Posco's inception, the company has repaid $1.7 billion.    ---   Surplus on Current Account   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Bolstered by strong exports, South Korea's surplus on its current account widened to a record $1.18 billion in March from $884 million a year earlier and $970 million in February, the central bank said.    The current account, the broadest measure of a nation's trade, comprises trade in goods and services as well as some unilateral transfers.    Despite the widening, central bank officials predicted that the surplus will narrow in coming months because of steps the government, under pressure from the U.S. and other countries, is taking to liberalize imports. </TEXT></DOC>
