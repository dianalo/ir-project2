The proposed action is not likelyto result in any of the following: (a) An annual effect on the economyof $100 million or more, (b) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers,individual industries, Federal, State or local government agencies, orgeographic regions, or (c) significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability ofUnited States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprisesin domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact</ITAG>This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR Part 1940, SubpartG, ``Environmental Program.'' FmHA has determined that this action doesnot constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the qualityof the human environment and in accordance with the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-190; an Environmental Impact Statement isnot required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Review</ITAG>This action affects the following Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistancenumbers and programs:<ITAG tagnum="16">10.404 Emergency Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">10.405 Farm Labor Housing Loans and Grants</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">10.406 Farm Operating Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">10.407 Farm Ownership Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">10.416 Soil and Water Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">10.421 Indian Tribes and Tribal Corporation Loans</ITAG>For the reasons set forth in the final rule related Notice to 7 CFR 3015Subpart V, this program/activity is excluded from the scope of ExecutiveOrder 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State andlocal officials.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>County committee members assist local FmHA offices by determining the eligibilityof applicants for Farmer Program (FP) loans. The 1985 Farm Security Act,Pub. L. 99-198, established county committee elections of two of the threemembers of the county committee by farmers deriving the principal partof their income from farming who reside within the county or area * * *'' However, section 607 of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987, Pub. L.100-233, has amended this provision by deleting the requirement that eligiblevoters derive the principal part of their income from farming. Other changesmade in the county committee election process by Pub. L. 100-233 includepermitting FmHA borrowers and those eligible for loans made or insuredby FmHA to serve on the county committee subject to section 336(c) of theFarm Security Act of 1985, as amended, making spouses of eligible farmerseligible to participate in the election process, increasing the periodfor receipt of nominations from 25 days to 45 days, and increasing thelength of the notice period prior to elections from 10 days to 30 days.The changes in the proposed action are designed to comply with section607 of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-233). In additionto changes made to the regulation as a result of Pub. L. 100-233, the Agencyclarified language regarding voting to ensure that each individual voteronly casts one ballot, whether that ballot is voted in person or mailedin. Another change was to clarify that functions performed by county orarea committees must be conducted under appropriate Civil Rights regulations.Two corrections were made to the regulations. The first dealt with retentionof disputed ballots. The time frame for retention of such ballots was increasedfrom 30 to 60 days to conform with the requirement that all ballots beretained for 60 days. The second correction dealt with the processing ofFederal appointments for committee members that related to the inclusionof Form I-9, ``Verification of Employment Eligibility'' in the appointmentpapers.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in CFR Part 2054</ITAG>Agriculture, County Committee Members.Therefore, FmHA proposes to amend Chapter XVIII, Title 7 of the Code ofFederal Regulations by revising Subpart W of Part 2054 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 2054_EMPLOYMENT</ITAG>1.

For this subpart, farmer isdefined as any person who has an interest in a farm as owner, tenant, orsharecropper within the county or area. The term ``farmer'' shall includethe spouse of an eligible farmer. One member, who shall reside within thecounty or area, shall be designated by the State Director. Designationmay also be made for alternates for each member of the county committeeand will be subject to all other requirements contained in this subpart.(2) In selecting designated members of the county committee, care shouldbe taken to ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that the committeeis fairly representative of farmers in the county or area. Designated committeemembers must be in sympathy with the family farm concept, be familiar withthe problems of farmers and residents of rural communities, and be in generalagreement with the objectives of FmHA. Designated committee members andalternates may also be farmers. However, if they are farmers, they neednot meet the criteria in andSection; 2054.1102(a)(1).(3) It is FmHA policy that membership on county committees reflect, tothe extent practicable, the diversity of the individuals served by theFarmer Programs. Eligible minorities and females will be designated whereverpossible, to serve on county and/or area committees. Therefore, State Directorsand/or County Supervisors will:(i) Engage in community outreach and information activities designed toeducate minorities and women on the nomination, election, selection, orappointment process for FmHA county committees.(ii) Make efforts to obtain recommendations from civil rights and women'sorganizations.(b) <T3>Area committees. </T3>A county committee will normally be establishedin each county. Area committees may be established by State Directors toserve a part of a county, parts to two or more counties, or a combinationof two or more counties when:(1) Topography and communications make it impractical to establish countycommittees according to county boundaries;(2) The workload in an individual county is extremely low;(3) More than one county office is necessary to service the workload ofan individual county; or(4) It has been determined that there are insufficient interested individualsto create a county committee in a single County Office's jurisdiction.(c) <T3>Action to create area committees. </T3>When a State Director establishesan area committee, he or she must issue a State supplement designatingthe boundaries that the committee will serve. The State Director shallgive public notice of boundary changes to county or area committees inofficial county newspapers or publications serving the area at least 30days before a county committee election takes place. If the establishmentof an area committee will result in the elimination of a county committeeand a surplus of elected county committee members, the State Director willtake the following steps:(1) Terminate one of the designated members of the two committees, if necessary.(2) Poll the elected members of the committees as to their continued desireto serve, and accept resignations from those who voluntarily wish to resignin inverse order as to their remaining terms; i.e., 1 year, 2 years, 3years.(3) If a surplus of elected members still remain after taking step (2)(paragraph (c)(2) of this section), the County Supervisor should have themembers draw lots for the positions.(4) In combining two county committees to create an area committee, theState Director must ensure that no more than one member of the reconstitutedcommittee is a farmer eligible for a loan made or insured by FmHA.(d) <T3>Temporary absence of committee members. </T3>When committee membersare not available to attend meetings, the County Supervisor can call alternatesto become acting members of the committee with the same duties and authoritiesas regular members. A quorum of at least two members or alternates is neededto have a county committee meeting.When utilizing alternates, the County Supervisor should ensure that nomore than one member of the committee is a farmer eligible for a loan madeor insured by FmHA. Persons will be considered covered by this provisionif they either currently have such a loan, or are qualified applicantsfor such a loan.(e) <T3>Permanent vacancies. </T3>In cases of permanent vacancies, alternatesmay be used to complete the unexpired terms of either elected or designatedmembers. Alternates should be designated in order of succession at theState Director's discretion; e.g., first alternate, second alternate, andthird alternate. This rule of succession is subject to the requirementthat no more than one farmer eligible for a FmHA loan serve at the sametime. Alternates succeeding to members' unexpired terms will serve outthe remainder of the term. If an alternate is not available to fill thecounty committee vacancy, the State Director will review the prevailingcircumstances and determine the best course of action as follows:(1) Continue with existing members until the next regular election. (2) Designate additional alternates. (3) Call a special election to fill vacancies. (f)<T3> Special elections.</T3> The State Director may set the date for specialelections that might be necessary in filling permanent vacancies or vacanciescaused by inability to complete a slate of nominees during a regular election.Vacancies created by the inability to complete a slate of nominees to fillan expired term of an elected member must be filled through special electionsheld not later than 120 days after the regular elections.
