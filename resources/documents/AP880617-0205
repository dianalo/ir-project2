(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Roxanne Pulitzer, whose 1982 divorce trialfeatured details of cocaine use, extramarital sex and jet-sethijinks, told members of the Florida Bar on Friday that lawyers andjudges cost her custody of her two children.   The Palm Beach divorce case ``almost destroyed the children,''she said about her twins, then 5. When the sex-and-drug allegationswere outlined, ``Mack and Zack went out the window ... all it waswas proving me an unfit mother.''   Ms. Pulitzer told the family law section of the Florida Barmeeting that lawyers for her husband, Peter Pulitzer, offered hertotal custody of the children if she agreed to a financialsettlement.   When she refused, they twice prevented a reconciliation and itbecame ``a war between lawyers,'' she said.   Circuit Judge Carl Harper awarded custody to her husband becausethe newspaper heir's lawyers ``created'' him into a thoroughlyreliable, loving parent while painting her as a lesbian, adultress,drug-user and uncaring mother, she said.   ``Judge Harper's final decree stripped me naked far more thanPlayboy ever did,'' she said, referring to her posing for themale-oriented magazine after the trial.   Harper cited ``flagrant acts of adultery and other gross maritalmisconduct'' for finding her unsuitable as a mother. Her appeal ofhis ruling failed.   Ms. Pulitzer, who is on a nationwide tour publicizing a book shewrote about the divorce, said she often speaks to divorce lawyersin efforts to prevent them from ignoring the needs of theirclients' children.   In her book, ``The Prize Pulitzer,'' she blames her ex-husbandfor nearly everything that went wrong.   Asked what she thought of Ms. Pulitzer's criticism of hercolleagues, family-practice attorney Cynthia Stump Swanson ofGainesville said: ``I agree with her to a certain extent. Lawyersare supposed to represent their clients but not to the detriment ofthe children.''   A newly developing ``guardian program'' that intervenes in adivorce suit solely on behalf of the children ``would have made abig difference,'' said another divorce lawyer who heard the speech,Nancy Rainey Palmer of Casselberry.</TEXT></DOC>
