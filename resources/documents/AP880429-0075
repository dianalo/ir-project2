Theo Frey and his family fled Irian Jaya, the Indonesian-heldterritory adjoining Papua New Guinea.   The family arrived Wednesday at Nhilunbuy, an airstrip inAustralia's sparsely populated Northern Territory. Theirsingle-engine Cessna 182 touched down after a five-hour flight,almost empty of fuel.   Frey said he feared for his family's safety and flew toAustralia with his wife Martha and 16-year-old daughter Sandrabecause it was the nearest refuge.   There was no immediate comment from Jakarta on Frey's assertionof harrassment during his work as a pilot for the Lutheran Church'sAssociated Mission Air service.   Frey refused to give further details, saying, ``We must considerour friends in Indonesia. All we want to do is go back toSwitzerland.''   Frey said he spent six months in Irian Jaya, where indigenousMelanesian separatists are trying to overthrow Indonesian rule.   Newspaper reports said Indonesian authorities suspected Frey of``spotting'' for Free West Papua Movement rebels operating in IrianJaya. The movement has been waging a guerilla struggle againstIndonesian rule over the territory since the early 1960s.   In Jakarta today, the newspaper Biznis Indonesia quoted the headof the air service, T. Stegen, as saying ``internal problems''might have caused Frey to abandon his job and flee with the plane.He did not elaborate.   Indonesians have resettled an estimated 2 million people fromIndonesia's densely populated Java island to the territory. Themovement claims the migration is depriving native Melanesians ofnational identity and economic, social and educationalopportunities.   Immigration officials granted Frey and his family temporaryone-month visas because they arrived without passports or clearancepapers.</TEXT></DOC>
