Contemporary man continuesto be dependent on these two energy sources, which include the nuclearfuel cycle. Radiation exposures from all energy sources should be examined,with particular emphasis on the nuclear fuel cycle, incidents such asChernobyl and Three Mile Island. In addition to risk estimation, conceptssuch as de minimis, life shortening as a measure of risk, and competingrisks as projected into the future must be considered in placing radiationexposures in perspective. The utility of these concepts is in characterizingpopulation exposures for decision makers in a manner that the publicmay judge acceptable. All these viewpoints are essential in the evaluationof population exposure from the nuclear fuel cycle.</TEXT></DOC>
