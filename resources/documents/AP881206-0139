LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A law that stripped governors of control overtraining missions by their states' National Guard isunconstitutional, an appeals court ruled today in the secondchallenge this year to the law.   Both cases developed over Guard trips to Central America.   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling came in a lawsuitfiled by Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich challenging the MontgomeryAmendment, which was enacted in 1986 and effectively eliminated arequirement that governors give consent to training missions fortheir Guard units. Prior to 1986, state units could not be sent onfederal training missions without such consent.   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in October rejected achallenge to the amendment filed by Massachusetts Gov. MichaelDukakis.   Perpich claimed in the lawsuit that, but for the MontgomeryAmendment, he would not have allowed his state's National Guard toconduct a training mission in Central America. The U.S. Departmentof Defense had ordered Minnesota guardsmen to active duty for thatmission.   The majority of a three-judge panel of the appeals court, inreversing the ruling of a federal district judge, concluded that theMontgomery Amendment deprives the states of the ``authority oftraining the militia'' and violates Article One of the Constitution.   The majority said the Constitution framers clearly intended thestates to have control over part of the the nation's military,except in the case of an immediate threat, as a check on the powerof the federal government.   ``We understand that today the nation's military forces oftenneed to respond instantaneously _ that the federal government mayneed to use troops in a variety of situations short of declearedwars,'' the majority wrote in the 80-page opinion. ``Yet, the worldhas not changed so dramatically that we can no longer abide by theprovisions of our Constitution, and we are not convinced that thenational defense will be harmed by our respecting reserved stateauthority over the National Guard.''   The Montgomery Amendment was passed after governors in somestates began objecting to National Guard training missions inCentral America. Until then, governors had the veto power under theArmed Forces Reserve Act but did not use it, according to MinnesotaChief Deputy Attorney General John Tunheim.   Minnesota first argued the case in July 1987 with support from 11other states before Chief U.S. District Court Judge Donald D. Alsop.The judge ruled in August that governors have no constitutionalauthority to withhold consent for National Guard training missionsin Central America or elsewhere, and thus upheld the amendment.   The number of states supporting the appeal dropped to five,Tunheim said. They were Massachusetts, Ohio, Colorado, Vermont andMaine. Some of the support was lost because the National Guard hasthreatened to withdraw federal funds from units in some states wheregovernors oppose Central American training missions, Tunheim said.   Justice Department lawyer Deborah Kant argued that governors haveno authority under the Constitution to redirect foreign policy byvetoing military training missions. She said the MontgomeryAmendment leaves intact gubernatorial veto power if guard units areneeded at home.   ``They just cannot object for foreign policy reasons,'' Kant toldthe judges.   Tunheim pointed out that foreign policy objectives of the U.S.government are protected under the Army Clause of the Constitution.Under that clause, he said, governors have no power over NationalGuard units when the president or Congress declares a nationalemergency or other special circumstances requiring National Guardtraining or action.   In Boston, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Oct. 25issued a one-sentence order affirming a May 6 decision by U.S.District Judge Robert Keeton, who upheld federal supremacy over theNational Guard.   In Washington, National Guard Bureau spokesman Dan Donohue saidtoday's decision meant two federal court circuits were now at oddswith each other, suggesting further legal action was likely.   ``But no decisions have been made officially on an appeal,'' thespokesman said. ``We're just now hearing about this.''   According to the spokesman, there are currently about 115,000 menand women serving in the Air National Guard and another 460,000serving in the Army National Guard.   The Pentagon is planning to send about 6,000 Guard members fromacross the country to Honduras during 1989 for road-building andengineering exercises, Donohue said. There are no such exercisesunder way at the moment because of the rainy season in CentralAmerica, he added.   U.S. Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., whose name iscarried on the amendment because of his role is creating it, said hewas disturbed by today's ruling.   ``If 50 governors are allowed to veto Guard missions because theydon't like the way our foreign policy is administered, it would havean adverse impact on training and would raise questions about theavailability of the Guard to meet its considerable defenseresponsibilities,'' Montgomery said in a statement released fromWashington.</TEXT></DOC>
