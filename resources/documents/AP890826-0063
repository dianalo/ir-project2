Anna Chennault, head of the Republican Heritage Groups Council,said Deng's children ``assure me he's in very good health and stillsmoking and swimming and sometimes scolding them.''   Mrs. Chennault also said that during a dinner with Beijing MayorChen Xitong, he said leaders erred in using troops againstpro-democracy protesters in June.   Chen said troops were used because police were not experienced inhandling riots and ``probably they didn't have enough police,'' Mrs.Chennault said.   Speaking at a news conference at the U.S. Embassy, she said Dengsent a message via his children that ``at this time it is better forhim not to receive any foreign visitors (to) show he's not trying totake over and trying to control all the other officials.''   Deng, 85, holds only one official post, as head of the CentralMilitary Commission, and in recent years has turned over much dailydecision-making to his proteges in the Communist Party andgovernment.   However, he still wields final authority, as was made clear whenhe ordered the June 3-4 army attack on demonstrators in Beijing, inwhich hundreds and possibly thousands died.   Well-placed Chinese sources have said Deng is seriously ill withcancer and is receiving medical care in Beijing. He has not beenseen in public since early June.   Reports from a variety of sources also indicate a power struggleis brewing over his succession, and that members of the conservativefaction that led the June crackdown are trying to play down Deng'sillness to gain time to consolidate their position.   Mrs. Chennault, however, said she was told Deng was in Beidaihe,a seaside resort northeast of Beijing where he and other topofficials vacationed in past summers.   ``I think this is a time that the leadership is going throughsome rearrangement of who will do what,'' said Mrs. Chennault. Shesaid she did not know enough about the situation to assess China'sstability.   Mrs. Chennault, who was born in Beijing, is the widow of Gen.Claire Lee Chennault, the famed World War II ``Flying Tigers''founder. She has visited China often and occasionally advisesPresident Bush on Asian Affairs.   She said she plans to report to Bush on her 10-day visit.   Mrs. Chennault said she met with Vice President Wang Zhen,Communist Party Secretariat member Ding Guangen and other officialsup to the ministerial level.   Topics of discussion included ousted party chief Zhao Ziyang, whowas purged in late June in a power struggle over handling of thepopular, student- led democracy movement and is still beinginvestigated.   He has not been seen in public since late May, and the governmenthas indicated he may be put on trial.   Asked what the leaders she met thought of Zhao, Mrs. Chennaultsaid, ``Certainly privately people agree Zhao Ziyang did a greatdeal.''   She refused to go into more detail and would not say if her talkscovered dissident Fang Lizhi, the astrophysicist who has been hidingin the U.S. Embassy with his wife since June.   She also refused to say if Bush had asked her to bring Fang up tothe Chinese but said that she met with the president before leavingfor China.   ``He did ask me verbally to tell his friends here that we arevery interested in continuing the good relationship that we havetried so hard to build in the last more than 10 years or so,'' Mrs.Chennault said.   Fang's presence in the embassy has strained Chinese-U.S.relations, already at a low point because of the crackdown. Therewas speculation that one purpose of Mrs. Chennault's visit was todiscuss Fang.</TEXT></DOC>
