(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Despite some misgivings, Wisconsin statesenators have approved a measure allowing blind people to hunt deerand other game if accompanied by a sighted hunter.   ``Do we really want people out there shooting guns when theydon't know where they're shooting?'' Sen. Alan Lasee asked duringdebate Friday night. ``As much as I have empathy for the visuallyhandicapped, I don't believe I can support this.''   Sen. Brian Rude supported the proposal and noted that theDepartment of Natural Resources can issue licenses to handicappedhunters.   People confined to wheelchairs are allowed to shoot or hunt froman automobile parked off a highway and more than 50 feet from thecenter of a roadway, he said.   The bill extends eligibility for a special permit to people whopresent medical evidence that they are unable to hunt alone becauseof a permanent physical disability or handicap, including blindness.   Under the measure, a visually handicapped hunter would have tobe accompanied by someone who could assist in sighting the firearm.   A 27-6 vote sent the measure to Gov. Tommy G. Thompson.</TEXT></DOC>
