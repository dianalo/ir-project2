Wednesday introduced five families of the ALRPOWERPRO.andM;Based on the Intel 33-MHz i486 and EISA-bus, the new product familiesincorporate a scaleable cache and dual processor upgrade path to accommodatetwo 33-MHz i486 microprocessors and up to 1-MB of ALR ServerCache on a single12-slot system board.andP;  Additionally, the ALR POWERPRO can expand up to 49-MBof RAM on the system board using industry-standard SIMMs.andM;Positioned to support high-performance requirements in a broad range ofnetwork server and data-intensive multiuser environments, the ALR POWERPRO isstrategically aimed to compete with Compaq's SYSTEMPRO.andM;Gene Lu, ALR chairman and chief executive officer, stated: &quot;Software is thedominant reason why ALR designed the world's first totallySYSTEMPRO-compatible system.andP;  As always, ALR brings to the industry aprice/performance system that is extremely attractive.andM;&quot;That is, ALR's POWERPRO, a 33-MHz i486 fileserver starting at $7,495, costsno more (often less) than any other single-processor fileserver on the markettoday.andP;  However, with POWERPRO, you can expand to dual-processing andaccomplish computational power of up to 40 MIPS,&quot; Lu said.andM;Dave Kirkey, vice president of marketing and international sales at ALR,added:  &quot;Finally, one year later, when software like Banyan VINES SMP andSCO's MPX for multiuser hardware is now available, ALR provides the marketwith a SYSTEMPRO-compatible fileserver, dubbed the POWERPRO with asignificantly higher performance rating and a price that is 30 percent lowerthan a comparably configured Compaq SYSTEMPRO.andM;&quot;By offering such an aggressive price point, ALR has made the customer buyingprocess for a fileserver an easy choice.andP;  They now have the flexibility tobuy a single processor today and a multiprocessor system upgrade when theirneeds arise,&quot; continued Kirkey.andM;The high-performance ALR POWERPRO, from single i486-based models to dual i486configurations, delivers a range of processing performance from 14.7 to 40MIPS.andM;At its highest configuration level, its efficiency is twice that of asingle-processor approach when running under operating environments like SCOUNIX/System V386 Release 3.2 with SCO's MPX multiprocessor software.andO;Furthermore, the ALR POWERPRO offers an industry-standard platform capable ofsupporting off-the-shelf SCO UNIX applications.andM;As a Novell network server, the ALR POWERPRO single-processor system providesthe performance compatibility with minicomputers as well as the storagecapacity and power source security needed to tackle the intense applicationsfound in this environment.andM;Disk mirroring, disk duplexing and disk spanning are among the many advancedfeatures the ALR POWERPRO supports when using Novell NetWare 386 or any ofthe popular network operating systems.andM;The ALR POWERPRO, using the ALR Intellimux system, can have up to 130 userssharing resources in complex department database applications.andP;  In addition,the ALR POWERPRO hard drive expansion can be increased up to 10-Gigabytes tohandle large departmental databases and productivity applications.andM;Available in a variety of configurations, the ALR POWERPRO has a suggestedretail price ranging from $7,495 to just below $25,000.andM;Systems are shipped in a floor-standing chassis with either a single or dual33-MHz i486 processor(s); 5- or 17-MB of 64-bit RAM using industry-standardSIMMs expandable to 49-MB; 12 expansion slots; eight EISA, two ISA and twoALR proprietary; from 64-KB and 128-KB expandable to 1-MB scaleableread/write-back cache RAM; two serial ports expandable to 130 user stations;a 1.2-MB 5 1/4-inch floppy drive; and either an embedded IDE 80-, ESDI 150-,330- or 650-MB and 32-bit EISA Bus Master SCSI 1.2-GB hard disk drive option.andM;Shipments are forecasted for first-quarter 1991 and will be available througha select group of qualified resellers.andP;  Twelve-month optional on-site andextended warranty options are available for these systems.andM;The ALR POWERPRO 486/33 Models 1 and 80 offer a buy-back incentive programproviding customers a rebate toward the purchase to upgrade to dualprocessing.andP;  For the return of their 33-MHz i486 CPU Module and 64-KBCachePak card, customers will receive $1,000 direct from ALR.andM;The ALR POWERPRO systems will be featured during the COMDEX '90 exhibition atthe Las Vegas Convention Center in booth 1886.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
