This announcement follows a Jan. 11, 1990, petition filedwith the agency by the National Federation of FederalEmployees. The petition charges that the health of agencyworkers and union members has been hurt by carpet emissionsat the EPA's headquarters in Washington.</LP><TEXT>   The agency has asked carpet companies to voluntarily testall of their products for total chemical emissions and toprovide the public with comparative information on emissions.The carpet industry has already promised to conduct voluntarytesting to identify specific chemicals emitted by newcarpeting.   There is no scientific evidence on the health effects ofcarpet emissions, the EPA said, although numerous chemicalsare emitted by carpets. The union identified4-phenylcyclohexene as a cause of respiratory and otherillnesses, due to fumes from carpets installed in a poorlyventilated area of the office.   Conclusive evidence on the health hazards posed by carpetswon't be available soon, and the agency said it will continueexpanding its research into the health effects of complexchemicals from all indoor sources.</TEXT></DOC>
