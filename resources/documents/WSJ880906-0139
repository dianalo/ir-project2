Brown (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Robert Tuttle, President Reagan's personnel director, called the White House switchboard with a seemingly simple task: He wanted to get hold of William Evans in San Diego to talk about a federal appointment.    Having traced Mr. Evans from his research institute office to a boat somewhere off the coast of Brazil, White House operators managed to leave a message with the ship taking him on the next leg of his voyage. &quot;I don't know what's going on, but the White House wants to talk to you,&quot; the captain said incredulously when Mr. Evans changed ships in Rio de Janeiro. &quot;If you're going to call, call collect.&quot;    Mr. Evans -- now the administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- still doesn't know how the operators did it. And the legendary White House operators aren't telling. Indeed, a big part of their mystique is their reluctance to discuss their near-magical ability to find anyone, anywhere at any time. Many of them have been on the job 20 to 30 years, serving each president and his aides with faithful -- or even fearsome -- tenacity.    Former Reagan personnel chief Pendleton James recalls the first time he used the switchboard, early in the administration. He wanted to discuss a cabinet appointment with Vice President George Bush, and, thinking Mr. Bush was nearby, asked the switchboard to get him.    Soon, the vice president was on the line. &quot;Where are you?&quot; Mr. James asked. &quot;I'm giving a speech in Boston,&quot; said Mr. Bush. He had gotten the message literally in the middle of his address, a messenger having placed it on the lectern as he spoke.    &quot;I thought it was very impressive,&quot; Mr. James says. He also became more careful about making calls: The White House operators are a weapon that must be deployed with extreme care.    Imprecision, for one thing, can be dangerous. Former Nixon counsel Leonard Garment recalls trying to reach Israel's ambassador to America. &quot;Get me the Israeli ambassador,&quot; he said. The operator got one: Ten minutes later a sleepy American ambassador to Israel (where it was 3 a.m.) answered the phone.    The operators, 19 women and one man, decline to be interviewed for stories about themselves out of a mixed sense of modesty and fear of the prank calls they say accompany publicity. &quot;They just want to sink into the sunset,&quot; says an official of the White House operations office.    Every day, they sit in a basement of the Old Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House, handling as many as 7,000 calls on a typical day. The job is never advertised: Applicants learn about openings by word of mouth. Most come from other government agencies and arrive with nine years' experience.    At the White House, they reach the top of their profession. &quot;When you say, 'White House calling,' people come out of the bathroom,&quot; says David Rubenstein, a White House aide under President Carter.    The White House operators have files dating back to the Truman administration. People whose numbers aren't listed anywhere else have entrusted them to the operators. They have Richard Nixon's private number, but don't bother asking them for it -- they won't tell.    Many people on the operators' lists routinely keep the White House abreast of any number changes. The operators also do their own research to update their files.    But filing cabinets alone don't explain the operators' skill. Also involved is a large element of persistence, and sometimes even detective work. Harry McPherson, Lyndon Johnson's White House counsel, observes: &quot;If you told the operator that you needed to talk to a tall man named Green, or maybe it was a short man named Brown, who you thought the president talked to in Korea about pharmaceuticals, the operator would call back with a Mr. White. And that would be the right guy.&quot;    By comparison, it is usually pretty easy to track down White House and administration aides. Top staffers have direct telephone lines to the White House installed in their homes. They also are supposed to wear beepers and keep the operators posted on their whereabouts.    Former Reagan communications director Thomas Griscom once wandered off without any notice, and the operators were forced to page his beeper. When he finally turned up, he was reminded of his responsibilities to the switchboard. &quot;That was my fault,&quot; says a chastened Mr. Griscom.    Generations of White House aides confess an attachment to the disembodied voices on the other end of the telephone line -- voices that, among other small favors, give wake-up calls to staffers going on trips. &quot;They were the closest thing to a mother if yours wasn't there,&quot; says Carolyn Shields, assistant to former Carter press secretary Jody Powell. Mr. McPherson and former LBJ aide Ervin Duggan both say that after 20 years, the operators remember their voices when they call.    President Johnson liked the operators so much he used to take some of them with him on presidential trips, preferring their voices to those of the Army Signal Corps personnel who normally handle communications for a president on the move. Presidents Nixon and Ford both paid the operators visits on their last days in office.    &quot;Some people who leave are guilty about decisions they've made,&quot; says former Reagan White House national security spokesman Robert Sims. &quot;I feel guilty because I didn't go see them or give them a box of candy.&quot;    For all their legendary abilities, the operators do mess up once in a while. Mr. McPherson and arms negotiator Paul Warnke both remember what happened when President Johnson tried to reach Mr. Warnke to offer him a Pentagon promotion. The president talked for five minutes before realizing that the man on the other end of the line was John Carl Warnecke, the architect. &quot;Oh, well, I'm sure you'd do a good job,&quot; Mr. Johnson said.    More often, though, the only problem with the operators is that they do their jobs too well.    Mr. Duggan, the former LBJ aide, once asked the switchboard to find a long-lost girlfriend in New York. &quot;Forty-five minutes later, they had her on the line,&quot; he recalls. &quot;I said: 'Suzanne, how are you? I'm coming to New York.'&quot;    &quot;I'm in Augusta,&quot; she replied. &quot;Do you know where I am? I'm at the country club at my wedding reception.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
