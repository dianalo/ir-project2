Earlier, the conference agreed to safeguard company secrets onthe production of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, andcalled for the elimination of CFCs by the end of the century.   CFCs are used in refrigerators, air conditioners, housinginsulation, food packaging and furniture, and to clean metals andtiny computer components.   Emissions of the chemicals are breaking down the ozone shield,which filters out the sun's ultraviolet rays, increasing the riskof skin cancer, eye diseases and hazards to marine and plant life,scientists say.   Developing countries argued they cannot afford to replaceappliances they imported or were given in aid by industrialnations, and the conference agreed a mechanism should be found tohelp the Third World phase out such equipment.   But industrial nations objected to proposals to set up a worldclimate fund, prefering to work through bilateral aid rather thanrelinquish direct control over the money they donate, delegatessaid.   U.S. delegate Stephen Seidel said an international fund couldcreate a bureaucracy whose administration costs would divert moneyearmarked for aid. Britain, Japan and Canada were among othersopposing the fund.   Mostafa K. Tolba, head of the U.N. Environment Programsponsoring the conference of more than 80 nations, adjourned theplenum for private consultations to work for a consensus.   Tolba summoned representatives from the United States, theEuropean Economic Community, China, Mexico and from the Group of 77developing countries.   An environment program spokesman said no announcement wasexpected until Friday, the last day of the four-day meeting.   The conference was reviewing the 1987 Montreal Protocol,ratified by 36 countries, which set out a timetable for slashingCFC production. The conference resolved on Tuesday to acceleratethe timetable.   At a closed-door session, the corporate secrecy issue caused afiery debate when the Greenpeace environmentalist group demandedfull disclosure of information submitted to the U.N. group onproduction of the chemicals.   The conference adopted a U.S.-European Economic Communityproposal to allow publication of total production figures, but theenvironmental group cannot issue a breakdown of the figures bycountry and by the chemicals each produces, said U.S. delegationleader Eileen Claussen.   ``It's a fair compromise,'' said Ms. Claussen, who is deputydirector of the Environmental Protection Agency.   Greenpeace delegate Karen Coulter said the secrecy could helpcountries hide the production of banned chemicals. ``How is it thatcommercial confidentiality can override environmental concern?''she asked.   Greenpeace's objections were supported by the Soviet Union,Norway and representatives of the Third World countries, theFinnish news agency reported.   The resolutions adopted by concensus at the conference have noimmediate legal standing. They will be part of a summary reportprepared for a meeting next year which will amend the Montrealtreaty.</TEXT></DOC>
