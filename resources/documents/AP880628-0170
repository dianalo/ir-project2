British Airways also expressed confidence in its two A320s andput them back on the schedule Tuesday after a two-day suspension.   Three people died and 50 were injured Sunday when an A320 with133 people aboard buzzed the airfield at 30 feet and failed theclimb. The plane crashed into a wooded area near Mulhouse, ineastern France.   An inquiry commission was set up ``to study the circumstances,research the causes and gather information'' about the crash, thegovernment publication Journal Officiel said Tuesday. The panel isheaded by Claude Bechet, a pilot and member of the TransportMinistry's office of accident inquests.   The pilot's union protested because it was not represented onthe panel.   At a news conference Monday, the Transport Ministry defended thefully computerized jet and said there was no reason to doubt theplane's performance. Airbus Industrie, the four-nation Europeanconsortium that makes the Airbus 320, said there were indicationsof human error.   Pilot Michel Hasseline was quoted by the French press after theaccident as saying the aircraft did not respond to his efforts toincrease power.   Preliminary investigations showed the Airbus was flying too low,Civil Aviation Authority chief Daniel Tennenbaum said. He said theplane required eight seconds to respond to the command of thepilot, who only had five seconds to maneuver because of thealtitude.   Christian Roger, president of the Air France pilot's union, saidthe engines may have failed to restart at Hasseline's command.   State prosecutor Jean Volff said the minimum altitude for suchcondition was 100 feet and that the pilot ``had disconnected theautomatic controls at the moment of the accident and was in manualcontrol.'' He did not elaborate.   The pilots' and mechanics' unions contend that safety requires athird officer in the cockpit of A320s _ in addition to pilot andco-pilot _ in case of a failure of the state-of-the-art computers.   In a joint statement Tuesday, they said the inquiry panel wascomposed of supporters of the two-crew system.   Air France's first A320 flight since Sunday's suspension tookoff from Paris bound for Duesseldorf and Berlin with 102 passengersaboard. Seven people who had reservations did not claim theirseats, a normal ``no-show'' rate for a European route of this type,the company said.   Britain and France have a big stake in the 17-year-old AirbusIndustrie, which has broken into the U.S.-dominated aircraft marketand employs about 150,000 people throughout Europe. Airbus, whoseother members are West Germany and Spain, says it has more than 500orders or letters of intent to purchase the narrow-bodied,fuel-efficient plane.   There are no A320s in operation in the United States. NorthwestAirlines has ordered 100, and Pan American World Airways has 16 onorder with an option to buy 34 more.</TEXT></DOC>
