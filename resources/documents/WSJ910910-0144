To buildtheir self-esteem, teach from a curriculum focusing on theirAfrican heritage, with books written by black authors.   But with students starting a new school year, theeducators' idea has run smack into a legal wall -- oneerected in large measure by some of the same liberal groupsthat are normally among the first to demand new and novelprograms to aid such students.</LP><TEXT>   In Detroit, plans to open three elementary schools forboys, with the curriculum centered on African-Americanhistory and culture, are on hold because of a lawsuit filedby the American Civil Liberties Union and the NationalOrganization for Women. Milwaukee, fearful of similar suits,has discarded recommendations by a local task force to opentwo or three all-male schools in its predominantly minoritypublic-school system; instead, it converted a virtuallyall-black neighborhood elementary school into an&quot;African-American immersion&quot; school for both boys and girls.   Similarly, a political explosion has sidelined a proposalto open a high school in New York focused on educating youngblack and Hispanic men.   The activities of the liberal groups, which findthemselves in the unusual position of siding with the BushEducation Department, are especially infuriating to theeducators who have devised the programs. &quot;The ACLU and NOWLegal Defense Fund, entities that know very little about whatit's like to live in the inner city, are making decisions forpeople they know nothing about,&quot; says Spencer Holland,director of the Center for Educating African-American Malesat Morgan State University in Baltimore. &quot;They know nothingabout the loss of hope, degradation and poverty in theseareas.&quot;   Dr. Holland, a black educator who recalls the painfuldiscrimination he encountered as a Columbia Universitydoctoral student in the 1970s, is credited with firstproposing the idea in a 1987 article in Education Week. Hebelieves the hardened culture of the city leads boys to scornschool, especially if it means obeying a woman teacher. Tocounter such forces, he recommends separating boys untilabout the fourth grade.   Schools, Dr. Holland explains, must &quot;show a boy at thisstage in his development that men read and write and singsongs and play games, that there are nurturing men,particularly black men. We want him to understand that thiswhole education thing is not just for girls.&quot;   The programs in question are specifically segregated bysex only, but because of the demographics of theneighborhoods they serve, most end up being exclusivelyblack. To the ACLU and NOW, as well as to the NationalAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, the resultwould mean a stunning and troubling about-face from the pasthalf-century's crusade to integrate the schools.   &quot;We need to find solutions to those problems which werecognize, as everyone does, but we don't think the solutionis returning to an era of widespread segregation,&quot; says PhilGutis, a spokesman for the ACLU.   The NAACP, in a resolution adopted at its convention thissummer, said it &quot;recognizes that the situation of theAfrican-American male in America is one of severe crisis.&quot;But in opposing &quot;all African-American male schools,&quot; thegroup said it was reaffirming &quot;its historical opposition toschool segregation of any kind.&quot;   Amid the furor, few dispute that the public schools arefailing black boys more than other children. The Milwaukeetask force found that more than four-fifths of the 5,716black male students in the city's public high schools hadgrade averages of D-plus and below. Fifty-four percent of themale students in Detroit's predominantly black public highschools don't finish. Nationally, an average of 6.6% of blackmale students dropped out of high school each year in 1986,1987 and 1988, according to the Education Department,compared with 4.4% of the entire high-school population.   The sobering statistics may be swaying President Bush.Meeting with education reporters yesterday, Mr. Bush said inanswer to a question about the controversy over all-maleacademies: &quot;I'm for as much innovation as possible. . . .We've got to abide by the law of the land. If our experienceshows us that we need to get modifications to accommodateacademies of that nature, we ought to do it. I do believethat something of that nature has some merit . . . but wecan't go out and advocate violation of federal law.&quot;   Education Secretary Lamar Alexander, a native Tennesseeanwho grew up in the segregated South of the 1940s and '50s,has said he is vehemently opposed to any program that wouldexplicitly segregate the boys by race. But when it comes toall-male programs focused on helping black boys, he saidafter Mr. Bush's session with reporters, &quot;We're not lookingfor ways to put our foot on innovation. We hope thatcommunities will use common sense and even try to do somedifferent things to help at-risk kids in cities to meet theirneeds, but we'll just have to monitor that.&quot;   The opposition to the idea has left school officialsreeling. Now they are desperately backpedaling to devise away to help their troubled male students that won't land themin court.   In Dade County, Fla., where federal Education Departmentwarnings led the school system to shut an all-boyskindergarten class in a virtually all-black Miami publicschool a few years ago, educator Barbara Carey has developeda program that will select 60 children who are havingdifficulty at four Miami elementary schools and put them in a45-minute-a-day &quot;Afro-centric, self-esteem&quot; class that &quot;willget them to feel proud about themselves and their heritageand background.&quot;   School officials acknowledge that most of the studentseligible will end up being boys. &quot;The boys are the oneshaving the most problems,&quot; Dr. Carey says. &quot;They are the onesscoring in the lowest quartile of academic achievement, theyare the ones dropping out of school, and they're the ones welooked at in the profile of the ones who are most at risk.&quot;But, she adds carefully, &quot;we are not precluding girls fromcoming into the program. If we find a girl at risk, we'regoing to bring one in too.&quot;   Detroit, meanwhile, has gone ahead and opened its intendedall-boys schools to girls. Twenty-seven girls have applied;about 560 boys are already enrolled.   To answer critic's complaints that inner-city girls alsohave plenty of problems, from drugs to teen-aged pregnancies,the Minneapolis public-school system has set up a half-dayAfrican-American academy in one local school for 30 at-riskstudents of both sexes. But it, too, has run into legaltrouble. Earlier this year, the state education commissionersaid the program violated state desegregation laws. However,in a recent meeting with Minneapolis school officials, hesaid his finding had been premature and ordered the stateboard of education to study the program.   So far, only a local Baltimore elementary school seems tohave managed to set up a program that hasn't run afoul oflegal authorities or political outcry. Two years ago, theprincipal of the school noticed that the 27 boys in thekindergarten class were having trouble in school. All wereblack, and she discovered that every one was being raised bya single mother.   So the principal, Leah Hasty, put the boys in a class oftheir own, taught by Richard Boynton, a young black man. Hewill stay with the class through the fifth grade. The programhas been so successful in improving attendance, behavior andacademic achievement that another local elementary school hasstarted a similar all-boys class. And both schools are nowbeginning all-girls classes as well.</TEXT></DOC>
