Dr. Jerry Keith, a National Institutes of Health scientist, saidThursday that his research team discovered that by merelysubstituting one amino acid for another in a single subunit of thewhooping cough bacteria gene, they could cause the bacteria to losea toxic reaction that has caused troublesome side effects.   Despite the development of a vaccine more than 40 years ago,whooping cough, or pertussis, strikes about 60 million children ayear worldwide. About 1 million die.   Most children in the United States are vaccinated againstwhooping cough during their first three years of life. Thus thedisease is rarely contracted in the United States.   But pediatricians report about 70 infants a year suffer someside effect from the pertussis vaccine. This is thought to becaused by a toxin that is included in the vaccine now used.   Side effects can include swelling and redness around theinjection, persistent crying among infants and, in severe cases,brain damage.   Keith said the goal of his research was to use geneticengineering to eliminate the toxic effects from the vaccine whileretaining the portion of the bacteria that causes the patient todevelop immunity.   The pertussis gene was cloned in 1986 by Keith and his team atthe NIH's Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Mont. Sincethen, Keith said, the group has been attempting to find the geneticsource of the toxin that causes side effects in pertussis vaccine.   ``The idea was to go in and change the bacteria genetically soit is no longer toxic, but still causes a very positiveimmunological response,'' said Keith. ``It turns out that if asingle amino acid change is made, that's enough.''   Keith said the researchers removed the gene from the pertussisbacteria and placed it inside a laboratory bacteria. They thenexperimented until finding which subunit of the gene wasresponsible for the toxin. When that unit was found, the scientistremoved one of 234 amino acids in the subunit and implanted a newamino acid.   Keith said it will take months of testing in test tubes andanimals before a new whooping cough vaccine would be ready to teston humans.   In addition to Keith, other scientists conducting the researchwere W. Neal Burnette and Vernon L. Mar of Amgen Co. in ThousandsOaks, Calif.; Witold Cieplak and Kaarel T. Kaljot of NIH, andHiroko Sato of the National Institute of Health in Japan.   A report on the research is published in today's issue ofScience, the journal of the American Association for theAdvancement of Science.</TEXT></DOC>
