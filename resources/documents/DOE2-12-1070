Inthe first part, the steam cycles applied in combined systems are discussedand the efficiencies of generating heat and electricity in industrialpower plants and in combined district heating plants are determined.The characteristics and performance of back-pressure and extraction-condensingturbine sets are described in analytical and graphical forms and severalnumerical examples of the detailed calculations of power and energy producedin combined systems are given. In the second part, the economic effectsof combined heat and power generation are presented in the form of fuelsavings in combined systems compared with the separate systems consistingof equivalent condensing power plants and of heating plants.</TEXT></DOC>
