State-run Baghdad Radio interrupted programming to announce thatIraqi troops, backed by tanks and helicopter gunships, recapturedfour ``strategic'' border heights along the Shehabi ridge, in thecentral sector of the 733-mile front.   ``The enemy is collapsing,'' Baghdad Radio declared. ``The fourheights were purged of the filthy enemy.''   Earlier, Baghdad Radio reported that the northern Mawat basin,in the Kurdistan mountains, was ``liberated'' after fierce battleswith the Iranians.   It said the Iraqi flag was hoisted on 24 strategic heightsoverlooking the town of Mawat town at 2:45 p.m. It said two borderoutposts occupied by the Iranians also were seized.   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, said the Iraqis launched theoffensive at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday. There was no immediate reactionfrom Tehran.   The Iraqis have been inching into Iranian-held territory innorthern Sulaimaniyeh province for several weeks. But they have nottotally dislodged their enemy from the strategic mountain region,inhabited mainly by pro-Iranian Kurds who are fighting the Iraqigovernment for autonomy.   Earlier, the official Iraqi News Agency said its aircraft bombedthe gas plant on Sheik Sho'eyb Island in the southern Persian Gulfand the Cyrus oil field in the northern gulf.   It said all the planes returned safely to their bases.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iraqi jetsbombed ``an industrial-labor complex'' on its southern gulf coast,killing or wounding an unspecified number of workers and causingsome damage.   The Iranians also claimed their air force fighters shot down anIraqi warplane over the gulf at 8.29 a.m., 30 minutes before theIraqis said their fighter-bombers hit Sheik Sho'yeb.   The Iranian news agency, also monitored in Nicosia, said asecond Iraqi jet was shot down over western Iran by anti-aircraftfire.   The Iraqi News Agency quoted a military communique as saying``large numbers'' of Iraqi warplanes were involved in the two gulfraids and left their targets ``engulfed with fire and smoke'' afterpenetrating Iranian air defenses.   ``The Iranian regime today received a strong blow which willhave an extreme effect on its economy and oil resources,'' thecommunique said.   The raids came several days after Iraqi forces drove theIranians out of their last major bridgehead in southern Iraq, theMajnoon islands in the oil-rich Howeizah marshes.   The Iraqis recaptured the southern Faw Peninsula on April 18,two years after the Iranians had seized it and a month later drovethem from a position east of the port city of Basra.   These battlefield defeats dramatically swung the militarybalance in the nearly 8-year-old war in Iraq's favor after years ofIraq being on the defensive.   The military setbacks have badly jolted Tehran. Prime MinisterHussein Musavi said today when he was re-elected by Parliament thatIran faces ``a historic confrontation'' with its enemies and must``prepare for an all-out struggle against them.''   The Iraqi communique declared: ``The Iranian regime must realizethat after the successive victories of the Iraqi army and air forcethat it has to accept peace and nothing but peace.''   The Iraqi air force's last major raids against Iranian oilinstallations were June 23, when 10 targets in the southwesternAhwaz, Bibi Hakimah and Sarran oil fields were bombed.</TEXT></DOC>
