But agency officials are warning they will show littlemercy to corporate executives, directors and other insiderswho run afoul of the regulations, which are scheduled to takeeffect May 1.</LP><TEXT>   The regulations govern the information that insiders arerequired to report to the SEC whenever they trade their owncompanies' stock. While the information is vital to theagency's efforts to police securities trading, it is alsofollowed by many investors for clues to the outlook for acompany's business and the direction of its stock.   In an effort to streamline bureaucracy and boostcompliance, the new rules address, and often alter, who hasto file reports, which holdings and transactions they have todisclose, and, in some cases, when the reports must be filed.And the new rules are accompanied by beefed-up penalties forthose who don't comply.   &quot;The risk is that people will be violating these rulesleft and right,&quot; and not know it, said Jesse Brill,securities counsel for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Mr. Brill,who is also publisher of Corporate Counsel newsletter, whichsponsored a conference on the new regulations earlier thisweek, warned that many companies could be held responsiblefor reporting errors, even if the companies didn't processthe filings for their insiders.   Currently, SEC officials say, about a quarter of the125,000 insider filings the SEC receives annually come inafter deadline, some of them months late. The SEC deadline,which remains unchanged under the new rules, requiresinsiders to report purchases and sales of their companies'shares by the 10th of the month following the trade.   &quot;The commission has been very disappointed with thedelinquencies rate remaining high, and will certainly usemeasures&quot; to reduce it, said Mauri Osteroff, associatedirector of the SEC's division of corporation finance.   The SEC is giving insiders until May 1 to file latereports from a company's past two fiscal years. While Ms.Osteroff stressed that &quot;there is no amnesty&quot; for late filing,the SEC will more aggressively pursue enforcement againstlate filers after that date than before.   &quot;A lot of people are having trouble coming to grasp withwhat it all means,&quot; said Robert Gabele, president ofInvest/Net, the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., company that tracksinsider-trading data and supplies the table that accompaniesthis column. Particularly, the new regulations' treatment ofoptions and the various types of options exercises &quot;mayrequire an interpretive letter from the SEC.&quot;   At the packed New York conference, attorneys and SECofficials stressed that insiders, for the first time, willhave to disclose all their stock-option, warrant andconvertibles holdings. This includes securities granted tothem by their companies and company securities they buy inthe market. They must report these securities on the firstfiling they would otherwise make after May 1.   In another major change, the SEC will treat a company'sgrant of options to an insider essentially as a stockpurchase. That means executives will be able to buy and sellcompany shares more quickly and more freely. Insiders will nolonger have to wait six months after exercising an option tosell stock; they will have to wait six months after theoptions were granted to sell the stock.   After May 1, insiders who file incorrectly or who filelate risk being hit with a cease-and-desist order. If thepattern continues, the SEC will go to court to imposefinancial penalties, SEC officials warned. Meanwhile, everypublic company will be required to list, in its annual proxystatement, the names of the insiders who either failed tofile a report or who filed a late report, and the number ofthose late filings.   If a company doesn't include this information, &quot;all theproxies could be invalidated in a court of law, if the courtwould find that the omission was a material omission,&quot; saidPeter Romeo, a Washington, D.C., attorney and co-author of&quot;The Section 16 Reporting Guide,&quot; a handbook on insiderreporting and trading regulations. The failure of a chairman,for example, to file notice that he sold shares &quot;goes to thecharacter of management,&quot; Mr. Romeo said, and could beconsidered a material omission.   The criteria for SEC enforcement action will berecidivism, the size and dollar amount of the trade &quot;andwhether, on getting notice, people have attempted to clean uptheir act,&quot; said the agency's Ms. Osteroff.</TEXT></DOC>
