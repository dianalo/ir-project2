It wasunclear if he has lost the backing of some past supporters.;    Many partyhard-liners think his liberalization program has gone too far and seek hisouster as party general secretary, the post to which he was named six yearsago as he rose to power.;    &quot;I think the general secretary will receive veryharsh criticism but will keep his post,&quot; Alexei Prigarin, a Communist leader,said.;    In an apparent move to appease hard-liners who say Gorbachev hassquandered his powers, the president issued a decree Tuesday night nullifyingArmenia's seizure last week of ownership of party property in the southernrepublic. Gorbachev rarely has used his decree powers in defense of theparty.;    In the joint statement with republic leaders, Gorbachev appealedfor &quot;decisive measures to restore everywhere constitutional order.&quot;;    Thestatement proposed repealing a controversial 5 percent sales tax on someitems, reducing plane and train fares, and linking salary increases to priceincreases. The agreement was published today by the official news agency Tassand the Communist Party newspaper Pravda.;    But the leaders rejectedGorbachev's call for a ban on rallies and strikes, instead declaring&quot;intolerable any attempts to attain political ends through incitement to civildisobedience, strikes, or calls for the overthrow&quot; of existing electedgovernments.;    The statement said the country is being torn apart by ethnicunrest and strikes by workers disgruntled over 3-week-old price increases. Theeconomy is on the verge of collapse, and there has been a paralysis of poweras many of the 15 republics refuse to follow orders from the centralgovernment.;    Much of the problem is the Communist Party.;    Although ithas relinquished its leading role in society, the party still largely runs thecentral government and is identified with efforts to maintain firm Kremlincontrol over the economy and the republics.;    The nine republics thatendorsed Gorbachev's economic stabilization plan will be given preferentialeconomic treatment by the Kremlin, the statement said. Lithuania, Latvia,Estonia, Georgia, Moldavia and Armenia did not take part in the talks.;    TheSoviet legislature approved the stabilization plan Tuesday. It calls forslashing the budget, selling off government industries and making the rublemore convertible to other currencies.;    The plan was sure to be presented attoday's meeting of the 410-member Central Committee.;    Gorbachev'sspokesman, Vitaly Ignatenko, said Tuesday that Communist Party conservativeswere expected at today's meeting to seek &quot;to take revenge for perestroika,&quot;Gorbachev's reform policy.;    Gorbachev is holding the middle ground in anintensifying political struggle. Hard-liners seek his ouster because he hasintroduced democratic reforms and diluted the power of the Communist Party.Pro-democracy reformers accuse him of abandoning them and the goals ofperestroika.;    But one Communist cautioned his fellow reformers.;    &quot;Thisis a game . . . aimed at luring the democratic forces to come to Gorbachev'sdefense and then to compromise them,&quot; Vyacheslav Shestakov, head of theRepublican Party of Russia, was quoted today as saying by the newspaperNezavisimaya Gazeta.;    Gorbachev could not be removed as general secretaryby the Central Committee, but the body could convene a party Congress andrecommend his ouster. That would almost surely force him to resign from thatpost.;    Gorbachev has shifted much of the powers of the general secretaryand the Communist Party to the government.;    Tens of thousands of workers inMinsk continued a strike for a second day. A member of the strike committee inMinsk said the protest had spread to 30 enterprises in nine other cities.;   The workers want increased salaries, a special session of the legislature andthe resignations of Gorbachev and other national and local leaders.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Moscow  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910424  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  852  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday April 24, 199100115085,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
