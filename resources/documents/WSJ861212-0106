The bid calls for holders to receive $48.50 in cash plus a junior security with a market value of $6.50 for each of their shares. Owens-Illinois, a Toledo, Ohio, packaging manufacturer with interests in financial services and nursing homes, said the proposed offer stated that &quot;key members&quot; of management would be allowed to buy equity in the new private company at the same price offered by Kohlberg Kravis, a New York investment firm that specializes in leveraged buyouts.    If the buyout is completed, the company could find itself heavily in debt depending on how much capital is put up by Kohlberg Kravis and Owens-Illinois managers and might have to sell some assets. Kohlberg Kravis typically sells some of the assets of the companies it takes private.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, the company's stock jumped $6.75 to close at $51.    The company said a special committee consisting of five outside directors was appointed to consider the proposal. The company hired Lazard Freres andamp; Co. and Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. to act as financial advisers.    The company said the proposal stated that Owens-Illinois would remain an independent company based in Toledo.    A spokesman declined to elaborate further on the proposal.    In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a company largely with borrowings. The debt ultimately is repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of assets.    In August, Owens-Illinois' stock suddenly jumped nearly $6 in two days on unusually heavy volume, prompting speculation that a bidder might be accumulating stock in the company.    Some Wall Street traders speculated yesterday that Owens may have invited a bid from Kohlberg Kravis, which usually deals in friendly transactions, to protect itself from an unwanted suitor. Some traders also said they expect Owens-Illinois will hold out for $2 or $3 a share more than Kohlberg Kravis's $55 bid.    H. Edward Schollmeyer, an analyst for PaineWebber Inc. called the proposed transaction &quot;a friendly deal.&quot; He noted that Owens-Illinois has been an agressive cost-cutter, reducing the number of employees in its glass container division, for example, to less than 8,000 from 20,000.    Kohlberg Kravis said it would finance the cash portion of its offer with its own equity capital and bank borrowings.    A source close to the firm said the Owens-Illinois purchase probably won't be as highly leveraged as its last big transaction, the $4.2 billion purchase of Safeway Stores Inc. last summer. The ratio of debt to equity for that acquisition was roughly 45-to-1. The source said the debt-to-equity ratio for the Owens-Illinois purchase would probably be closer to Kohlberg Kravis's usual 5 or 6-to-1.    Kohlberg Kravis is said to have an enormous cash reserve at its disposal. In its most recent round of financing last year, it raised a $2 billion equity fund. The firm doesn't currently own a significant stake in Owens-Illinois, the source added.    Owens-Illinois had $477 million of long-term debt at the end of the third quarter. According to a source close to the company, Owens-Illinois' forest products division might be a prime candidate for divestiture since its cash flow is less certain because of the cyclical nature of that business. Earlier in the year, Owens-Illinois agreed to sell timberland, three manufacturing plants and a linerboard mill to Temple-Inland Inc., a Diboll, Texas, forest products concern for $228 million.    Owens-Illinois earlier in the year bought Care Corp. of Grand Rapids, Mich., for $103 million and announced plans to expand its nursing home business aggressively into the 1990s.    In the third quarter ended Sept. 30, the company earned $57.2 million, or 94 cents a share, on sales of $911.2 million. </TEXT></DOC>
