More than 83 percent of the direct benefit of the tax cut wouldgo to those with incomes over $100,000 a year, according to a studyby the non-partisan staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.   The same staff estimated that 79.7 percent of the benefit fromthe cut Bush recommended last year would have gone to thatupper-income group.   Last year's bill would have delivered 1 percent of the taxreduction to those with incomes under $20,000; this year's versionearmarks 0.4 percent for that group.   The congressional staff report differs sharply from TreasuryDepartment estimates of how a capital-gains cut would affect thefederal deficit.   Treasury projected the cut would raise tax collections everyyear, and by $12.5 billion in the 1990-95 period. The JointCommittee report forecast annual revenue losses after the first twoyears and losses totaling $11.4 billion over 1990-95.   The committee had foreseen a $24.2 billion loss over six yearsfrom the bill that Bush backed a year ago.   Capital gains are profits from the sale of stock, real estateand other investments. They are fully taxed at the same rates thatapply to wages and other income.   Bush has made cutting the tax on capital gains a top priority,contending such a reduction is needed to keep the economy growing.   Under his proposal, only 70 percent of the profits from the saleof property owned three years or longer would be taxed; 80 percentof gains from two-year property and 90 percent from one-yearproperty would be taxed.   Democratic leaders of Congress use three arguments to oppose acapital-gains cut: Most of the benefits would go to the wealthy; itwould worsen the budget deficit; and it would lead to the undoingof the 1986 tax overhaul, which ended preferential treatment ofcapital gains.   The administration has never denied that the wealthiesttaxpayers would be the biggest benficiaries from a capital-gainsreduction, although spokesmen prefer to cite estimates that makethe point less dramatically than those from the Joint Committeestaff. The administration disagrees that a reduction would startthe unraveling of the landmark 1986 tax law.   On the deficit question, the Treasury Department contends that acapital-gains cut would be such a shot in the arm for investmentthat the economy would boom, generating more than enough revenue topay for the tax cut.   The new congressional report, signed by Ronald A. Pearlman,chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, agrees with theadministration that cutting the capital gains tax likely wouldinduce taxpayers to sell long-held assets in the short run.   However, Pearlman wrote, ``it is out best judgment that thelong-run behavorial response will be insufficient to produce along-run positive revenue effect.''   Although the committee staff said there was insufficientinformation on which to base long-term revenue projections, ``webelieve those losses will continue for years beyond 1995.'' If theeconomy continues to expand, revenue losses would be expected togrow each year after 1995, Pearlman said.   The congressional report estimates that over a one-year period,Bush's proposal would give a $15.9 billion tax cut to 10.76 milliontaxpayers, for an average reduction of $1,481.   People with incomes over $75,000 a year, who file about 3percent of all tax returns, would get 88 percent of the taxreduction. Their tax cuts would average $4,729.   At the lower end of the economic scale, those with incomes under$20,000, who file more than half of all tax returns, would get 0.4percent of the tax reduction. Only 697,000 of those 55 million-plustaxpayers would be expected to have any capital gains; their taxreduction would average $86.   In making these calculations, the congressional staff used abroad definition of income, which includes some items that are nottaxed. Those include tax-exempt interest, employer-paid health andlife insurance and non-taxable Social Security benefits.</TEXT></DOC>
