A White House official said Tuesday night the prevailing thoughtin the administration is that such an approach ``is one of the moreattractive'' solutions.   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity said thatincreased risk for the insurer should translate into higher premiumsfor the institutions.   White House officials were convened in a meeting late Tuesday bychief of staff John Sununu in a meeting that focused on whatrecommendations to make to Bush on the Sandamp;L situation.   `Things are a little scary to us,'' said Kenneth A. Guenther,executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association ofAmerica.   Guenther said he interpreted comments over the weekend by Sununuas indicating the administration was backing away from itscontroversial suggestion that depositors pay a fee of about 25 centson every $100 in their accounts.   Meanwhile, several members of the Senate Banking Committee calledfor a quick infusion of $2 billion into the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp. so that regulators could liquidate more insolventSandamp;Ls while Congress debates proposed reforms.   Sununu, responding to questions in a Sunday television interview,had defended the deposit fee idea as if he were talking about anincrease in the premium that institutions have been paying since1934.   He ``seemed to be moving away from a deposit fee to an increasein banks' premiums,'' Guenther said in an interview.   Senior administration officials are saying they will urgePresident Bush to propose a premium hike rather than a fee aid bydepositors, according to Tuesday's editions of The New York Times,which cited unidentified sources, and NBC News.   Bush intends to present at least an outline of his Sandamp;L plan whenhe addresses Congress on Feb. 9. So far he has indicated nopreference among the many options.   ``If I were to make a prediction, my guess is those premiums aregoing up,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ``Somebody's going to endup having to pay them. My guess is it will probably be theinstitutions, but the depositors will pay them indirectly.   ``We'll bury this (deposit fee) proposal on the one hand and digit up through another hole,'' he said.   The administration has told members of Congress it likely willpropose selling bonds for about $45 billion. The difficulty comes inraising the $7 billion to $9 billion needed each year to pay off thebonds.   The Sandamp;L industry and many members of Congress advocate using taxmoney, an alternative the Bush administration is trying to avoid.   Guenther said an increase in premiums for both banks and Sandamp;Lswould be unfair because about two-thirds of the money generated forSandamp;Ls would come from banks.   He estimated that a 25-cent increase in banks' 8.3-cent premiumwould push as many as 750 profitable banks into the red. To theextent that banks and Sandamp;Ls pass on the cost to their customersthrough lower interest rates on deposits, it would encouragedepositors to put their money in uninsured money market mutual fundsoffered by brokerage firms, he said.   The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the largest Sandamp;L tradeassociation, has said it cannot pay more toward the FSLIC's problemsand at the same time raise more capital from investors as a bufferbetween losses and insured deposits.   At the congressional hearings, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,noting an estimate that insolvent Sandamp;Ls are losing $1 billion amonth, said Congress should give regulators about $2 billionimmediately so they can liquidate some institutions rather thanrescuing them with promissory notes and loss guarantees.   ``I have to believe that an immediate infusion of about $2billion for the next six months or so would save us money in thelong run,'' he said.   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., agreed, saying, ``It's probablygoing to be six, seven, eight months at best'' until Congress actson a reform package.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., while not specifically backingDodd's proposal, said, ``I think we have to consider acting morerapidly.''   The committee chairman, Sen. Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., isagainst spending any money on the problem without tying it toreforms needed to prevent the problem from reoccurring. But he saidregulators were free to ask Congress for more money.   William Fulwider, a spokesman for the Federal Home Loan BankBoard, said the agency would wait until the Bush administrationpresented its proposal before deciding whether to ask Congress forinterim financing.   The bank board has already advocated that Congress allow it tospeed up the sale of the remaining $5 billion in previouslyauthorized bonds rather than spread the borrowing through 1990, asnow required.</TEXT></DOC>
