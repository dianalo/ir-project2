Several substantive areas of sociologicalinquiry including social-impact assessment, diffusion of innovations,conflict regulation, and social movements were used in the analysis toprovide a holistic understanding of the conflict. Qualitative methodswere used to collect the data. Participant observation, in-depth, unstructuredinterviews, and continuous monitoring of news articles, reports, letters,and other documents provided the data. It was found that the oppositiongroup formed in response to the resort proposal can be understood ifviewed as a specific social movement, with direct ties to the large environmentalmovement. However, because of the unique social context of the opponentgroup, some of the generally accepted characteristics of social-movementorganizations do not apply to this case. The lack of centralized leadershipand formal organization exemplify this point. Because of the group'svalue structure, formalization would be likely to harm rather than tohelp in the attainment of its goals. The study analyzes the groups' methodsof organizing its members and the strategies and tactics used to attainits goals, in light of its aversion to formal organization. Implicationsfor conflict mediation are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
