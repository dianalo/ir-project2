By DelegationOrder No. 0204-108, effective May 30, 1986, 51 FR 19744 (May 30, 1986),the Secretary of Energy delegated to the Administrator the authority todevelop power and transmission rates, and delegated to the Under Secretarythe authority to confirm, approve, and place in effect such rates on aninterim basis and delegated to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission(FERC) the authority to confirm and approve on a final basis or to disapproverates developed by the Administrator under the delegation. Department ofEnergy regulation DOE No. 1110.29 dated October 27, 1988, redelegated theauthority from the Under Secretary to the Deputy Secretary. This rate orderis issued pursuant to the delegation to the Deputy Secretary.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Power from the Georgia-Alabama System of Projects is presently sold underWholesale Power Rate Schedules GA-1-A, GA-2-A, GU-1-A, GAMF-2-E, ALA-1-E,ALA-3-A, MISS-1-E, MISS-2-A, SC-1-E, SC-2-E, CAR-1-F and SCE-1-A. All ofthese rate schedules were approved by the FERC on July 22, 1986, for aperiod ending September 30, 1990.Public Notice and CommentOpportunities for public review and comment on the Rate Schedules proposedfor use during the period June 1, 1989, through September 30, 1990, wereannounced by notice published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 28, 1988, and all customers werenotified by mail. Public Information and Comment Forums were held in Atlanta,Georgia, on January 5, 1989, and in Columbia, South Carolina on January10, 1989, and written comments were invited by the notice through March3, 1989. Oral comments were presented at the forum and written commentswere received prior to March 3, 1989. There were sixteen substantive commentsreceived. All comments were evaluated by Southeastern.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>System RepaymentAn examination of Southeastern's system power repayment study, preparedin March 1989, for the Georgia-Alabama System of Projects, reveals thatover the 2-year rate review period with an annual revenue increase of $12,757,000over the current revenues shown in a March 1989 Southeastern repaymentstudy, all system power costs are paid within their repayment life. Presentcontracts allow rate adjustments only on October 1, 1990, and every fivesuccessive years thereafter. Southeastern proposed a contract amendmentto allow a rate increase to be effective on June 1, 1989. Some customersdid not agree to the increased rates which were not allowed by the contract.Therefore, Southeastern is proposing to raise rates for those customerswho will agree to the rate increase and leave existing rate schedules forthose who will not agree to the rate increase. Southeastern will recoupthe revenue shortfall in the October 1, 1990, rate increase. Additionally,Rate Schedules GA-1-B, GA-2-B, GA-3-A, GU-1-B, ALA-1-F, ALA-3-B, MISS-1-F,MISS-2-B, SC-3-A, CAR-3-A and SCE-2-A, which are premised on all customersagreeing to the rate increase, will not produce revenue adequate to recoverall system power costs on a timely basis because some customers will notagree to the rate increase. The Administrator of Southeastern has certifiedthat the rates are consistent with applicable law and that they are thelowest possible rates to customers consistent with sound business principles.Environmental ImpactSoutheastern has reviewed the possible environmental impacts of the rateadjustment under consideration and has concluded with Departmental concurrencethat, because the increased rates would not significantly affect the qualityof the human environment within the meaning of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969, the proposed action is not a major Federal action forwhich preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is required.Availability of Information Information regarding these rates, including studies, and other supportingmaterials is available for public review in the offices of SoutheasternPower Administration, Samuel Elbert Building, Elberton, Georgia 30635,and in the Washington Liaision Office, James Forrestal Building, 1000 IndependenceAvenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585.Submission to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission The rates hereinafter confirmed and approved on an interim basis, togetherwith supporting documents, will be submitted promptly to the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission for confirmation and approval on a final basis fora period beginning June 1, 1989, and ending no later than September 30,1990.<ITAG tagnum="84">Order </ITAG>In view of the foregoing and pursuant to the authority delegated to meby the Secretary of Energy, I hereby confirm and approve on an interimbasis, effective June 1, 1989, attached Wholesale Power Rate SchedulesGA-1-B, GA-2-B, GA-3-A, GU-1-B, ALA-1-F, ALA-3-B, MISS-1-F, MISS-2-B, SC-3-A,CAR-3-A and SCE-2-A.
