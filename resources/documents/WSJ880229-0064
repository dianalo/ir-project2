For Sotheby's, the auction is a public relations coup, but an expensive one that will only pay off if international art collectors develop a big, new hunger for Russian art. For the Soviets, the auction is a glasnost-related move to give Russian artists new exposure and money-making opportunities. Many of the 100 paintings will be the work of contemporary Soviet artists who had been forced to work underground until an easing of official curbs began three years ago.    Lord Gowrie, chairman of Sotheby's U.K. unit, said at a press conference in London that the auction reflects the relaxation of Soviet restrictions on art exports, as well as &quot;a startling liberalization in the U.S.S.R. about (citizens) holding hard currency.&quot;    There have been several internal auctions in the Soviet Union in the past year, but all sales were in rubles and paintings weren't sold for export. For the Sotheby's auction, prices are to be paid in British pounds directly to the artists, or when applicable, the collectors.    The sale will also include a half dozen highly prized Russian avant-garde paintings of the 1910-1932 period. Sotheby's estimated that the sale will bring in a total of about $1 million, with individual artworks selling for between $3,500 and $35,000.    Sergei Popov, a senior Soviet Ministry of Culture official, said the U.S.S.R. hopes to increase art exports through the auction. Modern Soviet art has been exported since 1969, largely through Western middlemen, Mr. Popov said. &quot;Putting works up at auction will help establish international prices&quot; for Soviet art, Mr. Popov said at the news conference.    The Soviet connection underscores Sotheby's aggressive global expansion. Michael Ainslie, chairman of Sotheby's Holdings, said that Sotheby's opened an office in Budapest about six months ago, recently expanded in Tokyo and has started holding art auctions in Germany for the first time.    Such expansion is costly. For the Moscow auction, Sotheby's agreed to transport a selection of the Russian works to New York, Zurich, London and Paris for exhibition. It will also publish a lavish, bilingual catalog. Yet assuming the sale estimate of $1 million is correct, Sotheby's take will only be $100,000 to $200,000. &quot;Frankly, if the first sale breaks even we'll be very happy,&quot; admitted Mr. Ainslie.    Sotheby's said it expects many Europeans and Americans to bid by telephone. But for those interested in attending the Moscow sale (conducted simultaneously in English and Russian), special package tours will be available, including visits to artists' studios.    The Moscow link also shows the way Sotheby's and archrival Christie's International PLC increasingly apply aristocratic and political clout to win new business.    The courting of the Soviets by Lord Gowrie, Britain's Minister for the Arts from 1983 to 1985, exemplifies such tactics. One of his last official acts as Arts Minister was escorting then First Party Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife to a performance of Mozart's opera &quot;Cosi Fan Tutte&quot; at London's Royal Opera House.    Last year Soviet authorities returned the favor, rolling out the red carpet during a visit to Moscow by Lord Gowrie shortly before Christmas. Negotiations about the Moscow art auction intensified following the trip, Sotheby's officials said.    Mr. Popov contrasted Sotheby's aggressive approach with a more cautious tack adopted by competitors. The Culture Ministry official said the Soviets also received offers by unidentified U.S., French, Austrian and West German auction firms, and also had talked with Christie's. But unlike Sotheby's, Christie's &quot;is very very careful, and wants to tread slowly,&quot; Mr. Popov said.    Christie's insists it isn't out of the game. &quot;We could have a sale of Russian contemporary art tomorrow in terms of our discussions with the Soviets,&quot; says Christopher Davidge, a managing director of Christie's in London. &quot;But if a Russian sale isn't a success -- meaning 80% or 90% sold -- it could do long-term damage.&quot; Both Christie's and Sotheby's are based in London.    Mr. Davidge said Christie's will be visiting Russia again in several months at Mr. Popov's invitation, &quot;and we are very anxious to give them long-term advice. We are here to promote our client's property and not to promote ourselves.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
