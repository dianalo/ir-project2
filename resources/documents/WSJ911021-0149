Kahn</HL><DATE>10/21/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A16</SO><LP>   Lowell, Mass. -- Can a town summarize its entire checkeredpast with public art? And can it do so while impressing jadedtourists but not upsetting stodgy locals? This one isdetermined to find out.   For a decade, this faded mill-and-computer town has beenexperimenting with public art, and so far it has acquired adozen works, which range from amateurish to challenging. Thedriving force behind the purchases is native son andpresidential candidate Paul Tsongas, who as a senator in the1980s orchestrated Lowell's designation as a national parkand squeezed public art money out of state and federalgovernments and local corporations. His goals, he says, were&quot;to raise the sightlines of children growing up inworking-class families&quot; and &quot;to put the head back on the bodypolitic&quot; (that is, to lure professionals back to town). Theresults have varied drastically because Lowell is stillfiguring out how to walk its aesthetic tightrope. It attractsnearly a million tourists yearly, but its residents arenotoriously insular; many of them descend from mill workers,and it is not uncommon to hear outsiders called &quot;blow ins.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   In spite of all obstacles, public artists flock to Lowell,intrigued by its complicated landscape. Massive brick millsoverlook a twisty 5.6-mile canal system studded withwaterfalls, and heavily restored parts of town adjoinappealing but seedy areas that inspired native Jack Kerouacto write of &quot;midnight glow between windswept desolatetenements.&quot; And the town never holds still: It recentlywatched the Massachusetts Miracle perish, but its financeswill soon receive a boost from the opening of a National ParkService mill museum.   Lowell's weakest outdoor artwork is perhaps &quot;Homage toWomen&quot; (1984), a set of five bronze female mill workersposing on a granite pedestal near the town's visitors'center, which was commissioned by Mr. Tsongas. Their sweetfaces and gauzy, Degas-esque texture bring them to the brinkof kitsch, although Lowell residents protested theirmodernity when they arrived. &quot;They don't look like mygrandmother&quot; was a frequent complaint. Around the corner,&quot;The Worker&quot; (1985) commemorates local male heroes,specifically immigrant canal builders. The lone figure,realistic down to his suspenders, pokes a bronze pole into apile of water-splashed granite blocks, and he seems boredrather than oppressed.   Lowell's abstract pieces include &quot;Pawtucket Prism&quot; (1987),a shiny George Rickey clone incongruously planted at the edgeof a half-ruined canal, and a lumpy bronze called&quot;agapetime,&quot; which adds little to the other side of the samecanal. Mr. Tsongas commissioned the latter as a tribute tohis parents; the largest of the three lumps apparentlyrepresents fatherhood, the midsize one motherhood and thesmallest, offspring. Struggling for a way to compliment thepiece, Rosemary Noon, the director of the local culturalaffairs office, comes up with, &quot;It has a very nice texture.&quot;A more successful creative force at the site is neglect,which has spread a soft, lush patch of purple flowers acrossa dry section of the canal basin and smashed a canal wallinto a sooty, dramatic avalanche.   There is also, fortunately, much man-made art in town thatcan compete with Mother Nature. In 1988, Ben Woitena andlandscape architects Brown andamp; Rowe created a commemorativepark for Mr. Kerouac, a soothing enclave of eight granitestele incised with Lowell-related Kerouac passages andsurrounded by benches that encourage contemplation. And outof rough granite blocks the size of window lintels, CarlosDorrien built &quot;Human Construction&quot; (1989), a skinnyStonehenge that juts into a canal at either side of a bridge.It echoes the nearby masonry buildings and canal wallswithout trying too hard, and it is imposing; it manages to besimultaneously quiet and attractive. Mr. Tsongas hated thework at first sight and tried to change the minds of the artscommittee that selected it; the rest of town had similartrouble with it, says Ms. Noon, &quot;because there's notsomething to it you can immediately get.&quot;   Lowell now seems to be learning to like the avant-garde.Ever-stranger works are in progress. This fall SuzanneHellmuth and Jock Reynolds will begin renovating the rearfacade and yard of a brick dwelling that once housed a millagent (the man who supervised the operation for itsBoston-based owner). They will make the site accessible witha ramp that curves around a smokestack -- they love, says Mr.Reynolds, the prospect of letting people touch thisonce-forbidding monolith. They also will convert thebuilding's back room into a jokey summary of Lowell'shistory, with images of human faces wrapped around food tinson a high shelf (symbolizing Lowell's handouts during boutswith poverty), curtains and tablecloths printed with textilepatterns woven long ago in the mills, and gleaming sheets ofWang circuit boards across the ceiling.   David Ireland is creating another homage to Lowell's past,this one slightly more respectful. Renowned for adding onlysubtle traces of sculpture to existing spaces, he isreworking a generator room in a mill that will become officesas soon as the recession lifts. Ms. Noon calls this boxy,36-foot-tall space &quot;a kind of industrial cathedral&quot;; sunpours into it through translucent skylights, and its floordrops away eerily at the back, exposing a 20-foot-deep pocketof abandoned equipment. Mr. Ireland and countless studenthelpers are not doing much more than dusting off the mainfloor's turbine (a motor the size of an oil truck's tank) andattendant exciters (each the size of a felled water cooler),painting the brick walls a mottled white meant to evokeclouds, and cleaning a century of grease off the ceiling'sairy steel tresses.   Mr. Ireland's goal, he says, &quot;is to let the room be whatit wants to be.&quot; Even the straitest-laced Lowellians have notyet objected. But Ms. Noon is not growing brazen with futureplans. In a town of fierce opinions, she says, &quot;It's still soeasy to make a false step.&quot;   ---   Ms. Kahn is a free-lance writer living in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
