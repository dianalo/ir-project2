(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New Jersey state government is reeling fromwhat some are calling ``Computergate,'' the case of a Republicancomputer hacker who allegedly pilfered confidential Democraticfiles.   The files reportedly show the Democrats used state time forcampaign work.   It is a case that leaders of both parties declared closed inMay, when the Legislature's joint ethical committee dropped itsinvestigation and refused to release its findings.   But the issue won't go away.   Last week, Assembly Republican staff Executive Director JohnKohler quit his $95,000-a-year job after admitting he knew formerstaffer Jeffrey Land had broken into Democratic computer files.Kohler had previously denied knowledge of the actions.   State leaders concede that Land, who resigned in March, gatheredmore than 1,000 Democratic documents over 18 months. Landreportedly handed the purloined documents over to his superiors.State Attorney General Robert Del Tufo has launched aninvestigation to determine if criminal charges will be filed.   But the legislative committee's report, leaked to The Record ofHackensack, also raised questions about the actions of theDemocrats.   The pilfered documents show staff members of top Democrats usedstate time and state computers to plot political campaign strategy.The documents reportedly include lists of campaign contributors.   Critics charge that the Legislatur's decision to probe the casein private smacked of a coverup.   ``This is playing out with many of the same sordid aspects ofthe Watergate scandal,'' said Edward McCool, executive director ofNew Jersey Common Cause, a government watchdog group. ``There isdenial, coverup, secret meetings to decide what to do next. Andthere is the question of how far up it went. It seems theLegislature thinks it is above accountability.''   McCool said the computer breach ``was a break-in involving stateequipment by one partisan staff of another partisan staff. Justbecause technology is involved makes it no less a violation. It'sthe same as if a door was jimmied or a window broken.''   ``Why didn't the Democrats prosecute?'' McCool said.``Reasonably minded people can only speculate that it had to dowith the nature of the information that was stolen.''   Legislative leaders deny a coverup. They initially called theethics panel probe an internal personnel matter and said it wasprotected by the doctrine of separation of powers between thebranches of government.   Leaders from both parties have subsequently said they wouldcooperate with the attorney general's investigation. But AlbertPorroni, executive director of the non-partisan Office ofLegislative Services, told reporters that the Legislature canwithhold documents having to do with legislative activity onpending bills.   Democratic Assembly Speaker Joseph Doria on Monday said he was``saddened'' by the revelations and that he is ``upset it wouldhave to get to that level.''   But Doria also said he hadn't seen any of the stolen documentsand said he doesn't have ``the time or inclination to look through1,000 documents.''   Doria and other leaders refused further comment about whatdocuments should be turned over to the attorney general's office.   Assembly Republican Minority Leader Chuck Haytaian, whoannounced Kohler's resignation, said ``such conduct cannot underany circumstances be tolerated.''   Haytaian, who became minority leader in January, said in astatement: ``I remain convinced that no legislator had any suchinvolvement or knowledge.''   On Thursday, the ethics committee reopened its investigation andannounced it will call Land and Kohler to testify about their rolesin the incident. Land told reporters earlier in the week that hewill cooperate with the investigations. He has since refused tocomment publicly on the case. Kohler said Thursday he planned tomeet with the committee.   Haytaian said he will call for ``clear guidelines'' to determinethe responsibilities and obligations of partisan staff members.   However, McCool said revamping the system ``can't be solved inthe dark. This can only be solved if there is a full and publichearing of what happened.''</TEXT></DOC>
