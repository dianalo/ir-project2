It was stated that in patients receiving 1.2-1.6 GBq /sup 131/Idisturbances of parotid salivary gland function, manifested in decreaseof excretory function without secretory deficiency of parenchymatouscells were developed. When radioactive iodine dose was above 4 GBq, secretoryfunction of parotid salivary glands, which degree depended on introduced/sup 131/I medical activities, was disturbed. 1 ref.; 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
