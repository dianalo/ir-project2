(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Carla Southwell recalls vividly the 53days ``of sheer hell'' she spent in a jail cell for refusing todisclose the whereabouts of her two daughters, who she says weresexually abused by her former husband.   Nine months later _ with her contempt-of-court case under appeal_ she's back with her children but worried the reunion may betemporary.   A judge is expected to rule by year's end whether Ms. Southwellor her former husband, William Southwell, should be grantedpermanent custody of the girls, ages 5 and 6.   Ms. Southwell acknowledges that her earlier defiance may workagainst her.   ``I can't even imagine my kids living with him. It would destroythese girls,'' she said recently, sitting in her mobile home behindher parents' rural home. ``As it is, I don't know that they'll everfully recover.''   Ms. Southwell, 27, speaks in a whisper at times as the girlsfight over a Barbie doll a few feet away. Tears well as she talksabout the girls' depression and the distant look they sometimeshave.   The younger girl repeatedly sweeps her hand over her genitalarea, a nervous response Ms. Southwell attributes to the allegedmolestations. Her sister, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, wearsdiapers to bed since she began bed-wetting two years ago, after thealleged abuse began.   The girls recently have begun seeing a counselor ``because theyseem to need to talk about it, and I don't know how to handle it,''said Ms. Southwell, who also has a 17-month-old son by her fiance.They plan to marry when the custody battle ends.   Women have been jailed in several cities recently for contemptof court, choosing to serve time rather than submt their childrento what they believe i{ a sentence of abuse.   In the best-known case, Elizabeth Morgan, a plastic surgeon, hasbeen jailed since August 1987 in the District of Columbia forhiding her daughter from court-ordered visits with her father.Congress is considering legislation that would set a cap on suchjailings.   In the Southwell case, the girls indicated in a videotape for acustody hearing last year they had been molested, and a doctortestified that at least one of the girls had injuries typical ofchild abuse.   An investigation of Southwell, 30, and his younger brotherturned up no evidence of abuse, said Sgt. Ken Kleinheksel of theKent County Sheriff's Department.   ``This is one of the toughest cases I've seen and I feel sorryfor both sides,'' Kleinheksel said. ``But as far as I'm concerned,the case is closed.''   Southwell contends the girls were coached by their mother tomake the allegations.   ``I would kill myself before I would sexually abuse thosechildren,'' Southwell said Wednesday. ``As far as I'm concerned,that's about the worst thing a person can do.''   He said he has a strong relationship with the girls and isconfident he'll win custody. ``They know their dad never hurt themand that I love them; that's one thing Carla can't take away. Whenthey're here, they ask if they can stay.''   Carla Southwell was pregnant when the couple married in 1983.Less than two years later, they were separated, and they divorcedin 1986. She contends Southwell physically abused her during theirmarriage and that ``he didn't even know these kids existed. He wasnever around.''   She said her daughters told her in 1987 their uncle had sexuallyabused them on a visit to their father's. Later the allegationsincluded her former husband, she said.   She began canceling visits and Southwell went to court seekingpermanent custody. Her request for supervised visitations wasdenied, and a family services counselor told the court that unlessSouthwell was granted custody he likely would never see the girls.   Upon learning that custody might go to her former husband, Ms.Southwell fled with the girls, found them a place to stay andreturned to face court proceedings.   ``I knew I had to protect my daughters, but I never felt that Ishould run away with them for good because I hadn't done anythingwrong,'' she said. ``All I wanted was supervised visitation and himto get treatment.''   Kent County Circuit Judge George Buth charged her with contemptof court and ordered her jailed Sept. 7 until she produced thechildren. She was released Oct. 28 when the state Court of Appealsordered a stay of the contempt ruling while the case is appealed.   Since then, Southwell has agreed to supervised visitations untilan independent evaluation of the girls is completed and the judgerules on custody.</TEXT></DOC>
