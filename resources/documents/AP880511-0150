McMeekin, vice president of the African WildlifeFoundation. ``They think it's like jade.''   Ivory is so precious that the foundation suspects that traderssomewhere are hoarding it in the hope of a new price rise. CynthiaMoss, author of the recent book, ``Elephant Memories,'' toldreporters that today's price for raw ivory is $68 a pound, up from$2.40 in the 1960s.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says U.S. imports of carvedivory are worth $20 million to $30 million a year. The foundationestimates that 95 percent of it comes from Hong Kong, usuallysmuggled from Africa through the Middle East. Japan is an evenbigger customer.   The foundation estimates that the 800 tons of ivory sold in theworld every year costs the lives of 80,000 elephants. Americanscould save about 27,000 of those elephants by refusing to buy ivoryrings and other trinkets, it says.   The foundation calculates that the elephant population inAfrica, which may once have been as high as 3 million, was down to1.3 million in 1979 and about 750,000 today. Though it does not seea threat to the survival of elephants, it predicts that the entireenvironment of Africa will change because of the reduction inelephant numbers.   Mrs. McMeekin acknowledged that African governments, of whichabout 30 have elephants on their territory, oppose the campaign.   ``I had a four-hour fight with the Zimbabweans the other day,''she said. ``They don't approve at all.''   She said African governments work hard to protect wildlife andunderstand that they lose money from tourists as it disappears, butthey resent action from other countries.   Paul T. Schindler, president of the foundation, said that is whythe foundation opposes a bill now before Congress to ban imports ofivory. It also disapproves another, which Mrs. McMeekin said isbeing drafted, that would put a tax on imports of ivory with theproceeds to be used to promote conservation.   Schindler said that could mislead purchasers into thinking theywere helping protect elephants instead of promoting theirdestruction.   Mrs. McMeekin said she avoids using words such as ``boycott.''But she urged Amnericans: ``Don't buy ivory.''   She estimated that about 80 percent of the ivory in this countryis imported legally, though sometimes with the help of forgeddocuments, but was originally taken in violation of the law in anAfrican country.</TEXT></DOC>
