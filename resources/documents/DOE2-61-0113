The data suggest that, almost 20 years aftermining, most soil solutions and surface waters of the disturbed areasstill contain high levels of dissolved Al, controlled primarily by thesolubilities of a jubanite-like mineral (upper limit) and alunite (lowerlimit). Soluble Al in solutions of undisturbed areas was consistent withthe solubility of laolinite or gibbsite. The absence of jubanite x-raydiffraction peaks suggested the presence of an amorphous mineral or onestoichiometrically similar to jurbanite. The control of soluble Al bybasic aluminum sulfate minerals was not affected by the variable mineralogicaland tectural composition of soil and geological strata in the watershed.</TEXT></DOC>
