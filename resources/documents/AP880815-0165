The world body, which is in a financial crisis, gave details ofthe peacekeeping program for the first time in a published reportMonday. It said more than 1,300 personnel will monitor thecease-fire and troop withdrawal in the 8-year-old conflict.   The 159-member assembly scheduled emergency sessions Tuesday andWednesday to arrange six-month financing for the operation.   The report said about 350 of the U.N. monitoring team will beunarmed military observers. An additional 615 will be militarypersonnel, including 80 military police, 375 signal-communicationspersonnel, 130 helicopter crew and maintenance personnel and 30sailors. Another 350 will be civilian staff.   The U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group, its official name,was created last Tuesday by the Security Council afterSecretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced that both sidesagreed to observe a cease-fire starting Aug. 20. The belligerentswill begin direct talks under U.N. auspices in Geneva on Aug. 25.   About $47 million of the $74 million to be assessed is forstart-up expenses. The 24-nation force could be extended after sixmonths.   Preparations also are under way to put together the first U.N.naval force, which will patrol the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterwayand other sensitive areas.   The United States, whose fees add up to a fourth of the U.N.budget, is expected to be assessed about $23 million of the totalcost for the peacekeeping force. U.S. officials said Washingtonwants Arab nations and Japan to donate extra money to the force,since they are wealthy and benefit from the war's end.   The United Nations is in its worst financial crisis because ofarrears by its members, especially the United States. Washingtonowes $467 million of $602 million in unpaid dues to the regularbudget. It also owes $70 million in back dues for peacekeepingforces.   The United States, which promoted U.N. negotiations to end theIran-Iraq war, has been withholding dues in an effort to compel theorganization to institute budgetary reforms, cut personnel andimprove efficiency.   U.N. officials said the organization faces insolvency next monthif money is not forthcoming. About $44 million in U.S. funds hasbeen approved by Congress for this year but not yet released.
