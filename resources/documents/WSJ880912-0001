Robert Crandall, chairman, told analysts at a meeting in New York last week that a software &quot;glitch&quot; during the second quarter had caused the company to stop selling discount seats sooner than it should have.    The unit of AMR Corp. of Fort Worth, Texas, can't know exactly how many seats went unsold as a result, a company official said. But, he added, &quot;We estimate that that resulted in as much as $50 million of revenue that we otherwise would have expected to get.&quot;    The official called the matter &quot;an unfortunate mistake&quot; and added that although &quot;$50 million is a lot of money in anybody's book, in the overall scheme of things it won't have much impact.&quot; In the second quarter American had revenue of $2.13 billion.    The problem began either late in the first quarter or early in the second, when American installed some internally developed enhancements to its so-called yield-management system. Such systems monitor the pace of reservations on routes and make regular adjustments in the proportion of discount-price seats available.    At some point after American's employees installed their enhancements, the company recognized that too many discount seats were restricted from sale. &quot;The good part is that it didn't take us very long to correct it,&quot; the American official said.    The official added that no one was fired as a result of the problem. </TEXT></DOC>
