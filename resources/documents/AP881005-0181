The report said existing laws and the government's methods forinformation dissemination, established by Congress largely duringthe pre-electronic era, have been overtaken by technology.   ``The government is at a crucial point where opportunitiespresented by the information technologies, such as productivity andcost-effectiveness improvements, are substantial,'' the agency said.   Bibliographic, reference, statistical and scientific andtechnical information produced by the federal government isparticularly well-suited to electronic formats.   But the major federal information systems _ the GovernmentPrinting Office document sales program, the Depository LibraryProgram and the National Technical Information Service _ arelimited largely to paper and microfiche.   Full use of electronic technologies could help these agencies,OTA said.   ``What OTA tells us in their report is that the methods wedepend on to transmit information have reached their limits, andthat new technologies are waiting to change the way governmentcommunicates,'' said Rep. Robert Roe, D-N.J., chairman of the HouseCommittee on Science, Space and Technology.</TEXT></DOC>
