The oil and gas exploration and production concern said the gain, which is equal to about 85 cents a share, represents its part of a payment made by a natural-gas purchaser that wanted to get out of a contract with several producers.    For the year-ago third quarter, Ensource reported a loss of $919,000 on revenue of about $6.5 million.    In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Ensource shares closed at $6, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
