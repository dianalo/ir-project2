VGA standard.andP;  Second, it often represents a price pointseparating the high end of the market from the low end.andM;Some users might argue that only resolution in the 1,000-by-1,000 ballpark isgood enough for computer-aided design and -manufacturing and similardemanding tasks.andP;  But, particularly in the government, CAD/CAM plays secondfiddle to many other applications that do not require a million pixels butcan benefit from super-VGA resolution.andM;High-resolution monitors fall into four broad categories.andP;  First are theproprietary monochrome and paper-white displays, with resolution usuallyabout 1,000 by 1,000 dots per inch.andP;  They require specialized adapters andgenerally ignore industry standards.andM;The Viking line from Moniterm Corp. exemplifies this group.andP;  Equipped withvideo card, software drivers and monitor, the Viking is a complete videosystem for PCs and macintoshes.andM;A second group includes the autosynchronous or multisyncing color monitorsmade famous by NEC Home Electronics USA Inc.'s Multisync, which currentlydominates the high-end color market.andP;  In this group, resolution tends tocluster around 800-by-600, although many monitors support higher numbers.andM;The third group includes monitors compatible with IBM's 8514/A video adapter.andO;With 1,024-by-768 resolution, analog input and full color, monitors in thiscategory may be multisyncing or may operate at a set scan rate.andP;  Sixteen- and19-inch screens are common.andM;Fine-Tuned for DetailandM;The last category of monitors is reserved for ultra-high-resolutionapplications such as computer-aided design, -manufacturing and -engineering(CAD/CAM/CAE).andP;  No standards apply here because monitor, graphics adapter andsoftware must be fine-tuned to work together.andP;  Resolutions reach 1,600 by1,200 dpi and higher.andM;At the upper end, no price might be too high to pay for top-notchperformance.andP;  For casual word processing or spreadsheets, there is littlereason to buy anything better than an $ 89 monochrome monitor.andM;The vast range in between teems with users who may or may not benefit fromhigher resolution.andP;  Justifications for a high-resolution monitor in a newsystem purchase or upgrade are as numerous as estimates of next year'sfederal deficit.andP;  No single answer is wrong; many are quite reasonable undercertain circumstances.andM;Computer-aided design, traditionally done on dedicated workstations, putsheavy demands on screen resolution and refresh speed.andP;  The advent of powerPCs and programs such as AutoCad from Autodesk Inc. in Sausalito, Calif.,andO;raised up a large following of CAD/CAM/CAE users.andP;  They find high-resolutionmonitors a necessity, not merely an extra.andM;The nature of their work requires fine lines, high clarity and bright, sharpimages.andP;  For them, only high-end monochrome or color monitors will provesatisfactory.andM;Users who frequently produce graphics presentations prefer the quality anddefinition of a better display.andP;  However, the output device, whether plotteron film recorder, has more impact on their final results than does thedisplay.andM;Nevertheless, these users do want to see colors and lines on the screen asclose as possible to the final output.andP;  They can get excellent results with amultisyncing monitor.andP;  Higher resolution does not buy much more for them.andM;Perhaps the most common application calling for better resolution today isdesktop publishing.andP;  A user's eyes wear out fast trying to read two 81/2-by-11 pages on a standard monitor.andP;  High resolution maintains visualclarity so the reader can concentrate on the message.andM;The paper-white monochrome monitor is the logical choice for publishingbecause it mimics black-and-white output.andP;  A color monitor with1,000-by-1,000 resolution works well for those who spend only part of the dayon desktop publishing.andM;Image ScanningandM;A closely related and fast-growing technology is image scanning, which useseverything from handheld and small desktop scanners to large PC-linkedintegrated image storage systems.andP;  A high-resolution monitor can easeeyestrain from studying complex stored images.andM;Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) always has required high monitorresolution for continual refinement of data flows and processes.andP;  A monitoreven better than VGA is appropriate for CASE workers.andM;The user who spends long hours at standard applications also can musterarguments in favor of a better monitor.andP;  Many studies have found colorsuperior to monochrome for standard applications.andP;  Sharper screens mean fewermistakes and less fatigue at the end of the day.andM;For the power user, a multisyncing monitor provides the best overallprice-performance ratio.andP;  The issue is whether to stay at the low end or topurchase a monitor that supports the 8514/A video standard.andM;Of course, the monitor itself is only part of the high-resolution equation.andO;Some monitors must be bought with their own video controller cards.andP;  StandardEGA or VGA adapters will not support them.andP;  And it may take special softwaredrivers to use a high-resolution monitor with a particular piece of software.andM;The venturesome user who is willing to mix and match can buy a monitor with astated resolution, then locate the necessary hardware or software to adapt itto other needs.andP;  This is a cheap and flexible approach, but it calls forexpertise.andM;Two-in-One ProductandM;An alternative is to buy a video adapter and monitor in a single product.andO;Many manufacturers of high-resolution monochrome monitors package aproprietary video card as part of the deal -- for example, the Crystal ViewSE/II Macintosh monitor series from Taxon Corp. This route precludes a lot ofsearching, but a proprietary video adapter can keep the user from runningcertain programs.andM;On an MS-DOS machine, software drivers must be available for each program.andO;In a proprietary system, the vendor often provides drivers for well-knownprograms, but others run only in normal mode.andP;  At worst, they will not run atall.andM;Proprietary video always has been strong in the workstation market, where thebuyer purchased vendor-supported software and could run only two or threepackages.andM;Proprietary monitors usually support Hercules graphics.andP;  Vendors likeMoniterm provide more than 50 drivers with their monochrome monitors.andM;Even the most astute user can be confused by the array of high-resolutionchoices:  monochrome, gray-scale, color, CGA, EGA, VGA, PGA, 8514/A, analog,digital and multisyncing.andM;Since the introduction of IBM's PS/2 line, users also have had to grapplewith the question of whether signal input is digital or analog.andP;  All IBMvideo standards before VGA were based on a digital signal.andP;  Color selectionwas limited because of the signal's binary nature.andP;  Analog signals, on theother hand, have a large spectrum of up to 256,000 VGA colors.andM;But because the average person cannot use or even distinguish among more thanabout 16 colors on a single screen, those extra colors may be of doubtfulvalue.andP;  More important is the question of whether the monitor supports thevideo signal of the graphics card.andM;Fortunately, many monitors, including most multisyncs, support both analogand digital input.andP;  Usually only the cable end connected to the PC has to bechanged to alter signal reception.andM;Color, Monochrome or Gray?andM;An even bigger issue is whether to purchase a color, monochrome or gray-scalemonitor.andP;  Color is best for presentation graphics, or course, and gray-scalefor scanning halftone photos.andP;  After that, the issue blurs.andM;Databases and spreadsheets benefit from color highlighting of keyinformation.andP;  Colored screens also are softer on the eye and easier to readin ambient light.andM;However, if the output will be black and white, color distorts its screenappearance.andP;  Paper-white or gray-scale displays present a more honest pictureof the final result.andM;A gray-scale monitor requires analog input and simultaneously displays up to256 shades of gray.andP;  In contrast, a monochrome display is limited to two orpossibly four shades of gray.andP;  Some monochrome monitors, like the AppleMacintosh two-page display, are capable of some gray-scaling.andM;The misunderstood issue of dot pitch usually gets overlooked in selecting acoloro monitor.andP;  Most color monitors use a pattern of triads of red, greenand blue dots to show colors.andP;  Dot pitch represents the distance between twosimilarly colored dots in adjoining triads.andM;The accepted dot pitch for high-quality displays is 0.31 millimeters, withmonitors like those from Sony Information Products shrinking that distancedown to 0.26mm.andP;  In theory, the smaller the dot pitch, the easier it is toread the monitor.andP;  But an average user running average applications seldomnotices anything as small as 0.31mm.andM;Screen size is measured on the diagonal, with 12-, 14-, 19-, and 20-inchscreens predominating.andP;  Choice of screen size should be a function of space,use and price.andP;  Larger screens cost more but do not necessarily raiseproductivity.andM;CAD and desktop publishing users find 19- and 20-inch monitors attractive dueto the quantity of detail that must appear on the screen.andP;  A 20- or 21-inchmonitor will show two pages of text.andP;  However, a 14- or 16-inch monitor issatisfactory for many users.andM;IBM compatibility, always a big concern with peripherals, extends here beyondmerely working with the basic computer to compatibility with the videoadapter.andP;  The desired level of resolution always should be chosen first, thenthe video adapter.andP;  Finally, the monitor must support that video standard.andM;Levels of CompatibilityandM;Often the user's biggest worry turns out to be the cable connection and typeof video input, whether analog or digital.andP;  Most software drivers work witnVGA and 8514/A standards.andP;  If the monitor can support both, the user has abigger pool of software available.andM;Screen glare often bothers workers in a typically underdesigned governmentoffice space.andP;  The cheapest and most common techniques to cut down glare areetching and meshing.andM;Etching, produced by a thin coat of chemicals on the glass, diffuses lightreflecting off the screen.andP;  Unfortunately, it also diffuses the light emittedby the monitor and reduces clarity.andM;In meshing, a fine black nylon mesh is placed on the CRT to absorb reflectedlight.andP;  But light coming from the CRT also is absorbed, reducing displayquality.andM;A third approach, used by Moniterm and others, bonds an anti-glare panel tothe CRT.andP;  The panel cancels out the incoming light waves.andM;There is not eefect on the CRT itself, preserving display clarity.andP;  Ananti-glare panel is expensive and seldom appears as standard equipment.andM;Multisyncing monitors, popularized by the original NEC Multisync, areaffordable and flexible enough to emulate many standards and accept digitalor analog input.andM;A multisyncing monitor locks onto the video adapter's signal.andP;  Normally, itlooks for a singular signal such as the 15.75 KHz emitted by a CGA card, butit can search a broad band for whatever the video card emits.andP;  That usuallyincludes CGA through VGA and Mac II 15.75-KHz to 35-KHz signals.andM;While VGA technically means 640- by 480-pixel resolution, many multisyncingmonitors, such as Sony's CPD 1302 and Taxon's Multivision 770+, go up to800-by-600 resolution, often referred to as super-VGA.andP;  At this higherresolution, the software or adapter vendor must supply drivers.andP;  Commondrivers work with AutoCad, Lotus 1-2-3, Microsoft Windows, GEM, Xerox VenturaPublisher, Aldus Pagemaker and WordPerfect.andM;For general-purpose computing, the multisyncing monitor is hard to beat.andO;Setup and maintenance are minimal; resolution and color quality are highenough to satisfy most users.andM;Finally, competition is stiff enough that good multisyncing monitors can bepurchased for less than $500.andM;A step up from the 800-by-600 resolution of most multisyncs is the IBM 8514/Aadapter standard.andP;  Its resolution of 1,024-by-768 supports CAD and destktoppublishing.andP;  At present, IBM produces the 8514/A adapter only for the PS/2Micro channel Architecture but, not for the AT bus.andM;Although there are few alternatives to purchasing, IBM's own 8514/A graphicsadapter, there is broad flexibility in selecting an 8514/A monitor.andP;  Evensome multisyncing monitors can reach this resolution.andM;The 8514/A adapter supports screen interlacing.andP;  Interlaced screens arecheaper than their non-interlaced counterparts.andP;  In non-interlaced monitors,the electron gun scans each line on the screen from top to bottom within thevertical scan time, then repeats the cycle.andM;On an interlaced screen, only every other line is scanned, which produceshigh resolution at only half the vertical scan rate.andP;  Higher scan rates arenecessary for higher resolutions.andM;Some users dislike the flicker of an interlaced display.andP;  By the time theelectron beam makes the second scan, some of the original lines may be losingtheir brightness.andP;  But flicker can be unnoticeable if interlacing isimplemented correctly.andM;One technique uses long-persistence phosphors so screen refreshing occursbefore the dots lose their glow.andP;  A drawback is that long-persistencephosphors leave a trail known as ghosting on the screen.andM;Drivers AvailableandM;Many vendors write drivers for IBM-approved video modes, and manyapplications can take advantage of 1,024-by-768 resolution.andO;Higher-resolution monitors must provide their own drivers for resolutionsother than 8514/A.andM;The 8514/A monitors on the market include the NEC XL; the 1014 and 1019 FROMMicrovitec Inc.; the Patriot VGA/20 from Aydin Controls; and the Megatrend/12from Intecolor Corp.andP;  Most measure 19 or 20 inches and all support an analogsignal compatible with the 8514/A adapter.andM;The 8514/A may or may not emerge as a strong standard.andP;  Monitors can bepurchased for about $2,000, but AT-bus 8514/A video cards have not yetappeared.andP;  Acceptance of the standard depends on the output of hardware andsoftware vendors who respond to a perceived demand.andP;  Thus the jury still isout on the 8514/A.andM;One alternative to an 8514/A-Compatible monitor is a proprietary monochromesystem.andP;  Monitor and video card together often cost less than a good 8514/amonitor.andM;Wyse technology offers a high-resolution system with both monitor and videoconroller card.andP;  The Wy-7190 supports 1,280 by 1,024 pixels on a paper-whitedisplay.andP;  The accompanying controller board emulates MDA, Hercules and CGA.andM;Wyse, like most manufacturers of high-resolution monochrome monitors,supplies drivers for Windows, GEM, AutoCade, PC-CAD, Ventura Publisher andPagemaker, all of which can use the 1,280-by-1,024 mode.andM;Other manufacturers such as Moniterm, Monitronix Corp. and Conographic Corp.andO;furnish numerous drivers with their video adapters and monitors.andM;It is up to the buyer to make sure critical applications are supported at thehighest resolution.andP;  Nothing is worse than having to run a favoriteapplication in Hercules mode on a brand-new $1,000 monitor.andM;A variation of the monochrome system is the portrait-orientation paper-whitedisplay.andP;  Designed for desktop publishing, it shows black letters on avertical white background 11 inches high by 8-1/2 inches wide like a sheet ofpaper.andP;  Again, most vendors sell both video card and monitor in packagedeals.andM;A third option for desktop publishers is the analog gray-scale monitormentioned earlier for image scanning and halftones.andM;Ultra-high resolution systems occupy a unique place in the marketplace.andO;Normally reserved for workstations that run CAD and specialty applictions,they now can be attached to 80386-based computers.andM;The UHR-3000 raster-display monochrome monitor from MegaScan Technology Inc.andO;in Gibsonia, Pa., supports 4,096-by-3,300 resolution in non-interlacedrefresh mode and accepts digital input.andP;  Its 300-dot-per-inch resolution isidentical to a laser printer's -- a resolution previously unattainable bymicro monitors.andM;The accompanying frame buffer and Motorola 68020 display processor aremounted under the monitor.andP;  The UHR-3000 supports the Q-bus, MultiBus or ATbus and carries video to its host over fiber-optic cable.andP;  All this comes ata tremendous price, $18,000.andM;Another strong competitor in the ultra-high-resolution market is the MX-240from Monitronix Corp. in Westerville, Ohio, with the highest bandwidth in theindustry, 200 MHz.andP;  The MX-200 has one of the brightest screens to be found.andO;Resolution is 1,600 by 1,280.andM;Unlike the MegaScan product, the MX-240 uses normal video adapters.andP;  It ispackaged by Control Systems Inc. in St. Paul, Minn., with the company's ownultra-high-resolution cards.andM;Monitors Designed for the MacandM;Before the Macintosh II and SE, Mac users had to look hard for colormonitors.andP;  Now, as the accompanying charts show, Mac II-compatiblemultisyncing monitors are more common.andM;The Macintosh requires a horizontal scan rate of 35 KHz, slightly higher thanVGA standard.andP;  Most PC monitors that provide Macintosh compatibility do sowith a simple cable connector that fits on the end of the regular cable.andM;A few vendors cater strictly to the Macintosh crowd.andP;  Apple Computer Inc.andO;recently released two high-resolution monochrome monitors, one a portraitdisplay and the other a two-page displays, both aimed at desktop publishing.andM;Another Mac player is E-Machines Inc. in Tualatin, Ore., which makes color,gray-scale and monochrome monitors for the SE and II.andP;  The monochrome lineincludes an outstanding 21-inch two-page display with hardware panning thatallows the user to move around large documents and worksheets almostinstantaneously.andM;A third Macintosh-only vendor of monochrome and color displays is Radius Inc.andO;in San Jose, Calif.andP;  Both E-Machines and Radius package the monitor, videoadapter, cable and software.andM;Most applications do not demand a Mac-only monitor.andP;  It makes sense first todetermine needs and budget and then find the best monitor for the job.andP;  Amultisyncing monitor may be the best buy for general-purpose high-resolutionMac use.andP;  Nevertheless, for top-of-the-line applications, Mac-only vendorsdeserve attention.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
