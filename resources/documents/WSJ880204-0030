Walton, president and chief executive officer, said after addressing a gathering of analysts.    In the fiscal year ended May 30, 1987, the diversified manufacturer had profit from operations of $10.3 million, or 72 cents a share, fully diluted, on sales of $343.9 million. An extraordinary tax credit made net income $11.3 million, or 79 cents a share.    Primary earnings per share in 1987 were $1.15 from operations and $1.26 from net income. The company has made a number of acquisitions using convertible debt and preferred stock, producing the wide gap between primary and fully diluted per share results.    Mr. Walton said October's stock market crash has slowed the company's acquisition program, but hasn't had a noticeable effect on sales or operating profit of existing divisions. Domestic orders remain strong, he said, and foreign competition has declined, leading some Sudbury divisions to begin exploring export opportunities.    Sudbury's products include auto and truck parts, steel tubing and waste-handling equipment.    Because of the drop in the company's stock, which closed yesterday at $8, up 62.5 cents, in national over-the-counter trading, down from about $12 before the crash, Sudbury is unwilling to make major acquisitions for stock, Mr. Walton said. Also, the company doesn't want to increase its already high debt-to-capital ratio by making large cash acquisitions, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
