to frequentconversations in Fortune 500 MIS departments.andP;  AI has already created alegacy for itself, yet few realize just how the business made it to thethreshold of the 1990s.andP;  In the interest of ensuring you have your AI historydown pat before taking on a decade of AI breakthroughs, I've compiled acompendium of commercial AI for your reference.andP;  Feel free to consult itfrequently; keeping a copy pinned on your office wall or stuck to yourrefrigerator may not be a bad idea.andM;1975andM;Just as Gerald Ford is getting used to having the White House executivewashroom key, Larry Harris, a Dartmouth University professor, founds AICorp.andO;Harris developed INTELLECT, one of the first natural-language products, andone of the first commercial AI products of any kind.andP;  In 1989, AICorp is abig player in the IBM mainframe market -- as an expert-system company.andM;Nestor Inc. is formed by Brown University professors Leon Cooper and CharlesElbaum.andP;  This date indicates that neural networks are a lot older than mostpeople believe, but not as old as Zsa Zsa Gabor.andP;  In 1989 the company hired anew CEO, who coincidentally used to run Cognitive Systems.andP;  Nestor'sfinancials for a publicly held company have been somewhat erratic, but ithopes to make the coming decade the neutral-network 1990s.andM;1979andM;Not much happened between 1975 and 1979 on the AI front, but Jimmy Carter didmanage to bring love, compassion, hope, and economic despair to the forefrontof American politics.andP;  As the 1970s end, the hostage crisis covers thecountry like a shroud.andP;  Advanced Information andamp; Decision Systems is foundedfor AI contract work.andP;  The company, which used AIDS as an acronym, willchange its name in the mid-1980s to the less controversial Advanced DecisionSystems, or ADS.andM;Cognitive Systems is founded by Roger Schank and other Yale Universitypersonnel.andP;  Schank, known for fostering media attention with proportionssimilar to that of the recent San Francisco earthquake, is now head ofNorthwestern University's AI institute, funded by Arthur Andersen and Co.andO;Schank received not one, but three professorships for accepting this job.andP;  Ihad professors in school who could barely handle one teaching professorship,let alone three.andP;  But they weren't media superstars.andM;Inference Corp. is founded by Alex Jacobson and Chuck Williams with fundingfrom Control Data.andP;  Jacobson was instrumental in founding Lisp Machine Inc.andO;when he recognized the potential for commercial LISP workstations.andP;  Today LMIis held in the kind of esteem appropriate to major shipping disasters, suchas the Titanic or Lusitania.andM;1980andM;Ronald Reagan rides out of California to make the USA feel good about itselfall over again.andP;  Symbolics is formed to market hardware development of LISPmachines at IT's AI Lab.andP;  Picking up on LMI's lead, roughly a dozen membersof the AI Lab head across the street to start a workstation company.andP;  A 13thmember of the lab, who I'd love to name but won't under the threat of aholiday lawsuit, threatens to wire himself with explosives and blow up thelab if he is not included in the Symbolics' founding group.andP;  He is notincluded, and nothing detonates.andM;IntelliCorp is founded as IntelliGenetics by four Stanford researchers(Feigenbaum, Freidland, Kedes, and Brutlag) with the intention of marketingbiotechnology software.andP;  Today, Amoco owns a good percentage of the originalIntelliGenetics, which spun off from IntelliCorp, and all the founders(except Feigenbaum) are in AI's &quot;Where are they now?&quot; files.andM;1981andM;AI spent some time in the early 1980s getting itself on the right track.andO;Speech Systems is founded, and Thinking Machines is formed by MIT researchersto put technology developed by Danny Hillis into commercial development.andO;Teknowledge is formed by a dozen AI researchers from Standford, MIT, andother places.andP;  Anybody who was in AI at the time managed to get an honoraryfounder's position at Tek, and the founders photo that used to hang in thelobby looks like the entire Stanford faculty and undergraduates classpicture.andP;  In 1987, the company experienced a disasterous slide intomediocrity and was subsequently acquired by Cimflex.andP;  In 1989, most of thefounders won't even admit to living in the U.S.andP;  during Tek's founding.andM;1982andM;Dragon Systems is founded by ex-Verbex and IBM voice researchers.andP;  Gold HillComputers is founded by ex-Wang and MIT personnel to develop LISP languagesfor IBM PCs.andP;  The company is named after a founder's ranch in Idaho.andM;1983andM;Carnegie Group is founded by four Carnegie-Mellon University professors.andP;  Thecompany is partially funded and staffed by CMU, and initially looks like anoutplacement site for CMU AI grads.andP;  Since then, the company has beenrevamped, has a new CEO, and its founders are scattered to all corners of AIresearch.andP;  Syntelligence is founded by SRI International and Schlumbergerresearchers, some of whom were instrumental in designing the pioneeringexpert system Dipmeter Advisor.andP;  Incidentally, word has it that the DipmeterAdvisor was fully deployed this past year, a near-record 11 years fromprototype to delivery.andP;  The Smithsonian Institute may just have to dedicate awing to this application.andM;IntelliCorp introduces initial version of KEE and goes public, raising$8,700,000.andM;1984andM;Rockin' Ron gets elected to four more years of hanging out at the White Housewith people who will prove so loyal to government interests that many of themwill do hard time at Leavenworth.andP;  Arity is formed by Lotus employees (andwith Lotus funding) to develop PROLOG applications for the PC.andP;  GeneralMotors acquires $3 million of Teknowledge's preferred stock (approximately11%).andP;  This deal was touted with much fanfare by AI fans at the time, butpeople inside GM were quick to point out that this was less money than GMspent on postage that year.andP;  Maybe closer to paper clips and staples.andP;  Inretrospect, they might have gotten more out of the paper clips.andM;Texas Instruments announces that MIT agreed to acquire up to 400 of TI'srecently announced Explorer computers.andP;  The company later makes a publicamendment and correction to the deal, which involved substantial discountsand other perks, known in high-tech parlance as &quot;freebies.&quot;andP;  Sperry announcesthat it has signed a letter of intent to cosponsor research in the AI fieldwith TI and IntelliCorp.andP;  Sperry ultimately becomes these two companies'biggest headache.andM;Symbolics goes public with an initial offering of six dollars per share.andM;ACT Ltd. introduces its portable, the APRICOT, which includes Dragon Systems'voice-recognition system.andP;  Key Tronic announces its own speech-recognitionkeyboard, which eliminates the need for a separate voice system on PCs.andP;  (Asyou can see by the current state of computing, both of these products made ahuge impact on the way we use computers, similar to the impact that DanQuayle has had on the vice presidency.)andM;1985andM;You get the feeling that 1985 never really happened; after all, what did youdo in 1985?andP;  (It is, however, on all the old calendars I've seen.)andP;  FordMotor Co. acquires equity in both Inference Corp. and Carnegie Group for $28million.andP;  Verbex is shut down by parent company Exxon, which had failed inattempts to sell off the voice-recognition unit.andP;  Today, Verbex has beenresurrected and is doing well.andM;Excalibur announces the Savvy Retriever, a natural-language query systemoption for its Savvy PC system.andP;  This company went into bankruptcyproceedings about a year later, and disappeared into the New Mexico desert.andO;However, it reappeared last year with funding from Japanese investors and isnow a serious player in the neural-network market.andM;Hewlett-Packard grants $50 million worth of workstations for development ofAI to a dozen universities in the next three years.andP;  In hindsight, HP shouldhave kept the money and created a real AI group, instead of just pretendingto have one until it took over apollo in 1989.andM;Gold Hill Computers hires Carl Wolf as president and CEO.andP;  After being runout of the company last year, Carl now oversees the AI work at SunMicrosystems.andP;  Lisp Machine appoints Ward MacKenzie, an 18-year veteran withDEC, to the post of CEO and chairman.andP;  Lisp Machine secures $8 million infunding from some of its previous investors.andP;  These investors will ultimatelyprove to be somewhat unhappy.andP;  McKenzie will later have his experience at LMIconveniently left out of his resume.andP;  Teknowledge closes rounds of equityfinancing with Nynex and Proctor andamp; Gamble.andP;  Like LMI's investors, thesepeople will not be thrilled with the final results of this deal.andM;Computer*Thought and its investors file a lawsuit against spinoffArtelligence for violating certain employee agreements.andP;  It is probably oneof the saddest days in AI history when lawyers get into the act.andM;TI conducts a nationwide &quot;Satellite Symposium on AI.&quot;andP;  Applied ExpertSystems/APEX unveils its long-awaited personal financial package, PlanPower.andO;Xerox announces a $20 million dollar contract with Applied Expert Systems for1,000 Xerox 1186 AI workstations.andP;  At the time, this is the biggest LISPmachine order ever.andP;  The duration of this contract ends up being onlyslightly longer than the average lifespan of a spider mite.andM;1986andM;GNP Development (developer of HAL, a Lotus 1-2-3 natural-language interfacerecently released) is purchased by Lotus.andP;  While this deal made money for thefounders of GNP, you probably don't know a lot of people using HAL, do you?andO;I didn't think so.andM;Teknowledge, IntelliCorp, and Inference jump on the Jan. 22 announcement ofIBM's PC RT; Teknowledge sells 2,180,000 shares of stock in its first publicoffering, 500,000 more than originally planned.andP;  The stock goes for $13,which raises $28.3 million.andP;  Cognitive Systems files for its initial publicoffering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 2, 1986.andO;The IPO went out on May 16 with 1 million shares at $6.50.andM;Borland International introduces Turbo PROLOG for the PC.andP;  As a result, thecompany legitimizes PROLOG for programmers willing to spend less than $100,but not for mainstream computing.andP;  Arity offers a $50 trade-in credit onTurbo PROLOG to anyone who buys the Arity/PROLOG Compiler and Interpreter.andM;Breit International founder Bernadette Reiter is removed from the company andBreit is shut down.andP;  Originally a very secretive AI offshoot of MartinMarietta and Hewlett-Packard, the company is apparently opting for a morecommercial product strategy.andP;  This company was so secretive about its &quot;big&quot;plans that not even the people working there were sure what was going on.andP;  Itake some pleasure in this result because at the time the company was fond ofsaying things like, &quot;What we're doing is very important, and we're nottalking to anybody about it.andP;  But when we do get going, it will stand thisindustry on its head.&quot;andP;  I sleep better at night knowing there is at leastsome justice in the world.andM;IBM runs a tele vision advertisement showing how incredibly far it hasprogressed in achieving voice-recognition capabilities.andP;  Itssomewhat-hard-to-believe &quot;Mrs.andP;  Wright, write home right now&quot; ad puts therest of the AI industry in serious danger of laughing themselves to death.andM;Gold Hill Computers announces ACORN, an expert-system building environmentfor the IBM PC, designed for experts who are not experienced programmers.andO;Aion introduces versions of its Application Execution and Development Systems(AES and ADS) for IBM mainframes operating in the VM operating environment.andO;This is the opening salvo in the war of the mainframe expert systems, thehottest one going in AI today.andP;  Personal Composer introduces a new version ofits IBM PC computer music software product that includes a LISP interpreterspecifically for educational, research, and AI purposes.andM;Gensym Corp. is founded by exiting Lisp Machine Inc. executives and softwareengineers.andP;  They hope to develop real-time expert-system applications invertical market areas such as financial services and network monitoring.andM;Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone unveils the first LISP machine designed by aJapanese computer firm.andP;  The new machine, named Elis, featuresJapanese-language interface, the Motorola 68010 microprocessor, and a speedsaid to be several times faster than Symbolics 3600 machines.andP;  Symbolicsannounces losses of $18,778,000 for the period ending Sept. 30, 1986.andP;  In thewake of this news, the company moves back to its original building inCambridge.andP;  Teknowledge bucks the downward trend in AI quarterly revenues byannouncing record revenues for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 1986.andO;Teknowledge also discontinues all licensing of LISP versions of its S.1expert-system shell, the first company to move away from LISP.andM;ETA Systems announces the sale of one of its ETA10 supercomputers.andP;  Thecompany will sell fewer than 20 more before it goes under in 1989.andM;1987andM;The industry will always remember this year as the &quot;AI Winter,&quot; mostly due tohigh-pressure fronts from customers, cold shoulders from investors, andstormy personnel adjustments.andP;  Hecht-Nielsen Neurocomputer hires neural-netguru Stephen Grossberg and Synaptics hires his counterpart Carver Mead.andM;Symbolics lays off 160 people and fires their marketing VP.andP;  Carnegie Grouppresident Larry Geisel and others quit, and Intelligent Technology Group isformed by former Carnegie and Inference executives to develop intelligentapplications for the financial and text-based commercial markets.andP;  CarnegieGroup hires new president and CEO Dennis Yablonksy from manufacturingsoftware firm Cincom.andP;  LMI files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after failing tofind any further sources of funding.andP;  It took a long time to drive in thatlast coffin nail, but it finally happened.andM;Gigamos acquires LMI assets.andP;  Gigamos is the Canadian distributor of LMIproducts, and thus has an obvious stake in keeping the company alive.andP;  FreyAssociates shuts down, and most of its executives (including founder EricFrey) go to MicroProducts, which purchased some of Frey's technology assets.andO;Silogic files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and sinks without a ripple.andP;  HumanEdge files for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.andP;  Many of its assets, primarily PC andMacintosh AI tools, are picked up by Human Intellect.andP;  Scott Instrumentsreceives last-minute funding to avoid bankruptcy.andP;  Inference lays offapproximately 20 employees and IntelliCorp lays off 10% of its workers, andannounces a corporate &quot;realignment&quot; which also involves new productstrategies.andP;  Palladian removes founder Phil Cooper from chairman and CEOpositions.andM;Cullinet acquires DMS and the Application Expert system.andP;  The fate of thisgroup is in doubt since Cullinet has been acquired by Computer Associates.andO;Go Corp. is founded by Lotus founder Mitch Kapor and Teknowledge founderJerry Kaplan.andP;  Kapor also starts another AI-based corporation, On Technology.andM;Gold Hill introduces Gold-Works, an expert-system shell written in LISP forthe IBM PC, priced at $7,500.andP;  IntelliCorp and IBM agree to develop amainframe version of KEE, whereby IBM will market KEE under the IBM logo.andM;Teknowledge begins litigation against Paperback Software for allegedinfringement of its M.1 expert system tool.andP;  Meanwhile, Paperback Softwareannounces sale of its 10,000th VP-Expert.andM;IntelliCorp reports losses for the year.andP;  Symbolics reports losses for theyear.andP;  Teknowledge reports losses for the year.andP;  In general, the year was abig loss.andM;Nestor posts 1987 revenues of $125,607.andP;  Inference hires new president,Theodore Marr.andP;  Alex Jacobson remains as chairman.andP;  Symbolics realigns topmanagement, and ousts president Brian Sear.andP;
