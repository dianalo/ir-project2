 According to the Wall Street Journal,Businessland will have demonstration models of the machine on show nextmonth, and will take orders for delivery in July.andP;  The machine will be thefirst from Businessland to run Unix.andP;  Next also says that Lotus DeevelopmentCorp is doing a spreadsheet, Apple Computer Inc's Claris Corp a wordprocessor and Ashton-Tate Corp a database for the Next Computer System, eachto be file-compatible with the companies' products for MS-DOS and theMacintosh.andM;&quot;NO WORRIES, EVERYTHING'S FINE&quot;, IBM TELLS ANALYSTSandM;News was slow out of IBM's big Boston bash for analysts on Thursday, and byclose of play here, the only speech out on the wires was that of seniorvice-president Frank Metz, who insisted that IBM's expectations for demandfor the full year had not changed, and that the problem was solely related tothe low yield on the 3090S chip.andP;  He said mainframe production will return tonormal in the second quarter and that the missed production will be made upby the third quarter.andP;  But he said the problem has reduced the company'sflexibility if mainframe demand exceeds its expectations.andM;SUN TEAMS WITH CRAY; EMULATES IBM 5080 GRAPHICS SCREENandM;Cray Research and Sun Microsystems have a strategic alliance under which Sunworkstations will be integrated with Cray supercomputers, and Thursdayintroduced the first product out of the pact: the Cray FEI-3 channelinterface to provide high-speed data transfer between the Sun workstationsand Cray supercomputers.andP;  Cray will work with Sun's Strategic IndustryPartners Programme to bring the power of its machines to Sun users.andP;  Sun alsococked a snook at IBM, coming out with the 58TE terminal emulator, designedto enable Suns to emulate the widely installed IBM 5080 graphics terminal.andO;The product, part of Sun's programme to offer IBM links for workstationusers, is claimed to provide 100% functional compatibility with the 5080 andruns on Sun-3 and Sun-4s.andP;  It is $50,000 including the channel adaptorhardware, or $30,000 for the software only.andM;SUN JOINS PHILIPS IN COMPACT DISK INTERACTIVE EFFORTandM;And Sun teamed with Philips NV, Microwave Systems Corp, National ComputerSystems Inc and Datalink Corp to establish OptImage, a software tool venturefor the Compact Disk Interactive industry.andP;  OptImage will offer tools for SunUnix servers, VMEbus systems under OS/9, and MS-DOS boxes.andM;ELXSI FOR SALEandM;Elxsi Corp, San Jose, California has run out of the cash that its merger withTrilogy Ltd brought in, and recognises that it must do something quickly ifit is to survive.andP;  The firm has retained investment bankers Houlihan, Lokey,Howard andamp; Zukin Capital to seek seek a backer or a buyer for Elxsi.andM;PEGASUS LANDS SPHINX FOR #2.75 AFTER METROLOGIE DROPS OUTandM;Microcomputer software house Pegasus Group Plc has emerged as the eventualbuyer of Unix experts Sphinx Ltd, and will pay #2.75m for the Unix softwaredistributor with #2m in cash, #750,000 in new Pegasus shares - which will besplit between the various owners of Sphinx, including the venture capital armof Olivetti.andP;  Pegasus, cited as one of the original companies interested inSphinx when we broke the story here back in January (CI No 1,097), appearedto take a back seat as negotiations with the French Intel distributorMetrologie SA took priority.andP;  Metrologie, which had made a higher offer thanPegasus, was still the front-runner until Monday night, but talks with theFrench company broke down and the ball was back with Pegasus.andP;  Pegasus hasalso been looking seriously at Control Data Corp's Systime Ltd, but may notwant to digest two acquisitions so close together.andP;  Unaudited managementaccounts to September 30 1988 show Sphinx with pre-tax losses of #259,000 onturnover of #6.1m.andP;  Net assets are estimated at #500,000.andP;  Kettering,Northamptonshire-based Pegasus sees its main strength as PC network relatedaccounting systems: managing director Clive Booth claimed that the companynow has a 40% share in that market, but only a 10% share in the Unix market,where it sells its own Senior accounting package on Unix, Xenix and AIX-basedsystems.andP;  &quot;That is where the incremental growth will be&quot;, said Booth.andP;  TheSphinx dealer network will also boost the efforts of Pegasus to build upthird party sales, and Pegasus group marketing director Keith Hall said thecompany would support any of its own dealers wishing to move into Unixsystems.andP;  For its Unix distributor business, Sphinx is likely to retain itsown identi ty within the Pegasus Group, which recently reported recordinterim profits up 50.1% at #842,000 on sales up 12% to #3.9m for the sixmonths to January 31 (CI No 1,135).andM;DATA LOGIC AXES 70 JOBS IN THE UKandM;Data Logic Plc, the London software house owned by Raytheon Co, has announced70 redundancies throughout the company with about half of these coming fromadministrative positions.andP;  The restructuring is to strengthen Data Logic'scompetitive position in the trading room systems world market and is&quot;absolutely not&quot; part of a streamlining prior to being disposed of byRaytheon.andP;  Alan Thomas, the company's current president is taking asabbatical to work as head of the Defence Export Service at the UK Ministryof Defence, while John Ockenden joins Data Logic from CAP Scientific tobecome acting chairman and chief executive.andM;AMSTRAD PC2000 LAUNCH IN USandM;Amstrad Plc is ready to launch its high-end PC2386 and PC2286 machines in theUS, and is configuring them specifically for the US market.andP;  Its new AdvancedSystems Division in Irving, Texas plans to market through resellers andthrough one distributor, likely to be Micro D.andM;FUJITSU ANNOUNCES DURAandM;Fujitsu Ltd has announced Dura, a new expert system development tool that itclaims does not require the services of a knowledge engineer for the input ofexpertise, so that the specialist can build his or her own knowledge base: itwas developed at the Fujitsu research laboratories in Kawasaki near Tokyo,where a prototype car accident diagnosis system is running on a Fujitsuworkstation.andM;HITACHI ANNOUNCES NEW TECHNIQUE, ST-NETandM;And Hitachi Ltd has also announced the development of a new technique forprocessing expert systems: called ST-NET, it is claimed to speed upprocessing of inferences by 100 to 1,000 times compared with the previousgeneration of inference processors, and includes an improved backwardschaining algorithm, plus two-way inferencing, enabling the creation of moreflexible expert systems; the company is looking to have the thing ready toput on the market within the next two years.andM;MATSUSHITA, EPSON AND NEC TO PHASE OUTandM;THE USE OF CHLOROFLUOROCARBONSandM;We're all green these days, but Matsushita Electric Industrial Co, Epson Corpand NEC Corp are echoing St Augustine - &quot;let us be environmentally friendly,but not just yet&quot;: the companies have committed to phasing out the use ofchlorofluorocarbons in their processes - they are inter alia used to cleansemiconductors - but not until the year 2000.andM;KANEMATSU SEMICONDUCTOR TEAMS UP WITH DESTINY TECHNOLOGYandM;The Kanematsu Semiconductor arm of the Japanese electronics trading companyhas teamed up with Destiny Technology Inc, US maker of Hewlett-Packard- andPostscript-compatible laser printers to sell its printer controller chip setin Japan: the custom chip set incorporates a control language and circuits,and is claimed to be 30% faster and take up half the space of previous chipsets, and Kanematsu plans to combine the chips with its own IBM- compatiblepersonal computer BIOSes and cloning chip sets and offer them to Japanesemanufacturers of desktop publishing systems; Destiny's latest product is achip set that combines a controller for both Hewlett and Postscript printers,all on one applications-specific circuit that replaces 19 chips.andM;NTT DEVELOPS HIGH-PERFORMANCE, ULTRA-THIN TRANSISTORandM;Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp has developed a high- performance,ultra-thin transistor for use in liquid crystal diode displays, and the phonecompany sees it being used in high- definition televisions and advertisingdisplay equipment: the new transistor is 10 times faster than the currentgeneration, but will take about three more years to perfect.andM;MATSUSHITA DEVELOPS 8M-BYTE VIDEO MEMORYandM;And Matsushita Electric Industrial Co has developed an 8M-byte video memoryfor use in high-definition television receivers: the part has about eighttimes the capacity of existing video memories and has an access time of 20nS;the company is promising sample shipments for next year, moving into volumeproduction in 1991; the price is expected to be kept low at less than $40 permemory; the design involves use of 16M-bit dynamics and a proprietary columndirection drive mode, which is designed to cut power consumption.andM;FUJI DENKI DEVELOPS COMPUTER-ASSISTED INSTRUCTION MATERIALSandM;TO USE FUZZY LOGIC ON PCandM;Fuji Denki Co has developed computer-assisted instruction materials to teachpeople to use fuzzy logic on a personal computer: developed in collaborationwith the NTT Central Electronic Communication Academy and Professor KaoruHirota of Hosei University, the software is claimed to be simple enough thatunskilled users and university students can learn to apply fuzzy logic -where the computer is asked to look for a best match where none are exact,for instance recognising that &quot;comapny&quot; almost certainly means &quot;company&quot;; thepackage comes with a manual and floppy disk for either NEC Corp's PC9800series or Fujitsu's FM series; the system costs $450.andM;JAPAN ASHTON-TATE PREPARES DATABASE PROGRAMandM;FOR THE MACINTOSH PCandM;Japan Ashton-Tate Co is preparing a database program for all models ofMacintosh personal computer distributed by Apple Computer Japan: the packageis designed for easy retrieval of daat by invoking screen icons with a mouse:the program is shipping now and costs $760.andM;NTT TO CUT LEASED LINES CHARGESandM;Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp is to cut leased line charges by an averageof 8.4% from May 1: the reductions were originally planned to start in March,but were postponed because of the introduction of the Japanese government'sconsumption tax from April 1.andM;HITACHI TO CONVERT SUPERCOMPUTER SOFTWARE FOR ITS MACHINES IN USandM;Pushing on with its plans to sell more hardware in the US by having moresoftware available for its large machines, Hitachi Ltd is to set up anorganisation in the US for converting supercomputer software for itsmachines: the new Hitachi Computer Products/Marketing andamp; Systems Division willbe at its US Computer Support Center in Santa Clara, California and willaddress the fact that there are presently only 120 applications available forits suprecomputers, compared with 500 for Cray Research Inc machines andabout 260 for those from Fujitsu Ltd; in 1987, Fujitsu had 49.5% of theJapanese super-computer market, while Hitachi had just 20%; in an effort toincrease its market share, Hitachi established a Supercomputer ExpansionGroup last year.andM;HITACHI SANTA CLARA COMPUTER SUPPORT CENTRE INSTALLS HITAC M66DandM;Meantime the Hitachi Santa Clara Computer Support Centre has installed aHitac M660D high-end mainframe to provide technical assistance for users andto support software development, and similar support centres are planned forNew York, London, and Singapore.andM;HITACHI DEVELOPS 32-BIT MICRO FORandM;THE EUROPEAN, AUSTRALIAN MARKETandM;And Hitachi has developed its first 32-bit micro for the European andAustralian market: the HL500 is an 80386SX-based a laptop with 680 by 480pixel black-on-white liquid crystal display with eight shades of grey: themachine will go for about $5,600 with 20Mb internal Winchester, $6,250 with a40Mb disk.andM;FUJITSU MAKES NEW PROGRAMMER BUILDING IN THE SHINAGAWA DISTRICTandM;Deciding there's strength in numbers, Fujitsu Ltd is bringing the programmerscurrently housed in 10 of its 13 software development offices in Tokyotogether into a single new building in the Shinagawa district that willemploy a daunting 1,000 programmers, saving them time commuting betweendifferent bases.andM;WANG EMBRACES IBM'S SYSTEMS APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE WITH SETandM;OF CO-EXISTENCE ITEMSandM;Wang UK Ltd is claiming Systems Application Architecture support for a newrange of products targeted at IBM users.andP;  Chief of these is Version 2.0 ofWang's VS Access/3270 office automation and electronic mail software,designed for IBM mainframes with 3270 terminals.andP;  The product supports MVS,VM, and DOS/VSE operating systems, costs #3,800, and is available now.andP;  Thecompany has also announced VS/Access APPC, its first API ApplicationsProgrammers Interface, designed to provide 3270 users with Wang VS-residentapplications.andP;  By interfacing with the Systems Network Architecture LU6.2protocol and Advanced Program-to-Program Communications, VS/Access APPCenables mainframe applications and resources to access VS resources.andP;  Theproduct also provides VS Cobol or PL/I programs with reciprocal links to CICSprograms on an IBM host.andP;  VS/Access is available now, and costs between#8,000 to #11,000.andP;  In the summer, Wang plans to introduce VS Snads, a secondprogrammers interface designed to provide VS applications with access to anIBM Systems Network Architecture Distribution Service or SNADS network.andP;  Wangclaims that with VS Snads, VS users will be able to transfer data written toSNADS specifications, and network a number of VS computers together.andP;  Stillin the network environment, the company plans to make its network and systemsmanagement range compatible with IBM's NetView.andP;  This will enable a VScomputer to act as a information routing service point within an IBM network.andO;According to Wang's IBM integration product manager Alistair Lamb, theBrentford-based company is also planning to provide SNA products for Unixmachines, mail gateways, and additional support for binary synchronousnetworks, &quot;as Systems Application Architecture evolves&quot;.andM;UNIPLEX DEVELOPS GRAPHICAL OFFICE SOFTWARE WITH IXI LTDandM;A new version of the popular Uniplex integrated office automation suite isbeing developed by Uniplex Ltd , Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, which willintegrate IXI Ltd's X.desktop technology as a front-end to the Uniplexsoftware.andP;  The application was shown in a test format on the Uniplex stand atUniForum, but at present it remains nameless and without a price, althoughscheduled for a June launch.andP;  Both companies will be selling the package intotheir respective markets, and neither see a clash of interests.andP;  Uniplexhopes to push into the workstation arena with this addition to its range, andhas no plans to adopt any other interfaces at present.andP;  In addition,X.desktop - developed on top of the X Window System by the Cambridge,UK-based firm, which has scored a notable success by getting NCR to adopt theapplication as its graphical interface to Unix - is now to be distributedthroughout the US by Unipress Software Inc, Edison, New Jersey.andP;  X.desktopwas previously available only from a handful of hardware and softwarecompanies.andM;INTERACTIVE TO BUNDLE MOTIF WITH UNIXandM;Interactive Systems Corp, Santa Monica, California, which is strengtheningits position in the Unix environment with the acquisition of LachmanAssociates, is to offer the Open Software Foundation's Motif user interfaceon its workstation software: bundled in with the 386/ix X11 Windowing SystemRuntime Package it costa $300 - available from the third quarter.andP;  Thedevelopment toolkit system will be on sale for $800 sometime in the secondquarter.andM;DATA GENERAL ADDS PRODUCTS TO TURN MV MINIS INTO SERVERS INandM;MS-DOS NETSandM;As part of Data General Corp's series of product launches (CI No 1,132), thecompany has introduced DG/Infact, a software package that allows MS-DOSpersonal computer users to query a database residing on a Data GeneralEclipse MV/Family server, without having to know its physical location,structure or query language.andP;  The product, co-developed with Apple Computer'sNetwork Innovations subsidiary, distributes processing between personalcomputers and MV family servers; prices range from $3,900 on the MV/1400 to$35,000 on the MV/40000 HA.andP;

 Applicationsinclude fibre-optic token-passing-ring local area networks, transmission ofdigitised video signals and workstation networking.andP;  ATandamp;T claims it can offerJapanese manufacturers volume-manufacturing capability and verticalintegration.andP;  ATandamp;T's Japanese office includes the first ATandamp;T BellLaboratories product design organisation located in a foreign country; thefibre optic link will be manufactured in the United States.andP;  ATandamp;T claims thatthe ODL 125-FC was designed specifically to comply with Japan's industrystandard for fibre- optic connectors; it is scheduled for introduction inmid-1989.andM;IBM ANNOUNCEMENTSandM;IBM fulfils June 1988 promises by announcing details of imageandM;handling from PS/2sandM;It was only last week that an IBM visiting fireman was reminding us that thecompany takes image processing very seriously these days (CI No 1,139), andthe company duly came out with dates and first products in its ImagePlusline, leading off with the PS/2 ImagePlus Workstation Program Version 1.0.andO;This is designed to capture, view, print, and manipulate image documents on aMicro Channel architecture model of the PS/2 - see, IBM is trying to obsoleteall those hordes and hordes of AT bus machines out there - but as usual withIBM, the software implementation lags dismally, and so while the new offeringmay sell the odd Micro Channel, it won't do anything for the sorry sales ofOS/2 - the thing runs under multi-tasking PC-DOS 4.0.andP;  (IBM seems to havecompletely forgotten that the majority of its mainstream users cut theirteeth on a mainframe operating system called DOS, and now insists on callingPC-DOS simply DOS; Computergram is more pedantic).andP;  The new program is acomponent of the IBM ImagePlus System, designed to support the conversion ofpaper-intensive applications to computer-based electronic systems.andP;  Paperdocuments are scanned and manipulated at the workstation and then transmittedto the host application for storage and on-line retrieval.andP;  The IBM PS/2ImagePlus Workstation Program is designed for high-volume image handling,enabling savings in processing cycles and reduced paper handling costs.andP;  Itsends and receives architected image data streams in compressed format;controls movement of various pages of a document including move to the next,first, previous or last page; provides viewing functions including scrolling,rotating, and magnifying images; enables concurrent display of alphanumericcoded data and image documents; provides document modification such as addinga new page to a document; and supports direct attachment of a scanner and/ora printer to the image workstation for high-speed/high- volume processing.andO;It communicates with the IBM ImagePlus host system components in the MVS/ESA,AS/400 and System/36 environments on an IBM Token-Ring Network using SNA LUType 6.2 communications protocol.andP;  The PS/2 Image Adaptor/A is also needed onthe micro.andP;  Its announcement fulfills the statement of direction made inIBM's June 28, 1988 announcement (sounds a bit like those bits in the NewTestament where events are hallowed by the writer pointing out that byhappening the way they did, they fulfilled some Old Testament prophecy).andP;  Theprogram will be available on September 29 and will cost $600 in the US.andM;Here are the promised new ImagescreensandM;Oh and IBM wants people to buy new screens for their PS/2s if they are goingto use ImagePlus.andP;  The PS/2 Monochrome Display 8508 is a horizontal 19&quot;analogue, multimode, white phosphor raster display capable of displaying upto 1,600 by 1,200 pixels at 114 pels-per-inch in a viewable area of 14.0&quot; by10.5&quot;; using the large screen enables display of either coded or non-codeddata in image and text applications.andP;  The fact that it is analogue, says IBM,increases the capability for selecting grey shades.andP;  Up to 16 out of 256shades of grey, dependent on the screen mode being used, are available whenthe thing is attached to the PS/2 Image Adaptor/A, and programmable selectionof screen resolution is supported.andP;  The display contains a self-regulatingpower supply accommodating voltage that can be used in both the US and Europe- this is a new IBM policy - make one version for the world.andP;  The thing costs$1,300 from September 29.andP;  And if you don't like that one, you can alwayswait for the PS/2 Monochrome Display 8506, a vertical or portrait 17&quot;analogue, multimode, white phosphor raster display that puts up 848 by 1,200pixels at 100 pels-per-inch in a viewable area of 8.5&quot; by 11.8&quot;, so the thingcan put up a full A4 page.andP;  All the other features are the same as for the8508 - including the $1,300 price - but the thing doesn't arrive untilDecember 29.andP;  But while the 8508 landscape monitor provides two display areason the screen, side-by-side, to handle coded data and display imagesconcurrently, users of the 8506 have to use a second monitor on the same PS/2to look at the coded data application; users of MVS/ESA can use a separateIBM 3270 terminal for the coded data.andM;Delivery dates for ImagePlus for  MVS/ESA, AS/400 and SystemandM;36 usersandM;The workstation program ain't much use unless you've got the host end ofImagePlus as well, so what of the ImagePlus System MVS/ESA, AS/400 andSystem/36?andP;  Rappelons que, as they say Outre Manche, the IBM ImagePlus SystemMVS/ESA, AS/400 and System/36 consist of a set of components, includingapplication and storage management software, on-line optical storage, andPS/2-based image workstations to provide comprehensive hardware and softwaresystems to facilitate input, storage, retrieval and distribution of imagedocuments using SAA Common Communications Support.andP;  Functions are included tomanage flow of work through the system and to provide a consistent method oforganising image documents and distributing them for processing.andP;  IBM hasn'tsaid much about optical disks, although those with long memories willremember that substantial parts of the system come from Filenet Corp, CostaMesa, California.andP;  Becoming more and more incomprehensible is IBM's use ofthe term RPQ, which once stood for Request Price Quotation, and doesn't seemto mean anything very much now.andP;  The original connotation was of a productthat was a special, made available as a favour to a small group of customers,and specifically had no price attached.andP;  Now, none of those things apply, andsome of the essential parts of a full ImagePlus system are labelled RPQs.andO;Thus it is that the Optical Library Unit RPQ and the Optical Disk Drive RPQwill be available on September 29, with the MVS/ESA Direct Attachment RPQfollowing in December 29, 1989.andP;  Also out in December is MVS/ESA FolderApplication Facility 1; MVS/ESA Object Distribution Manager 1; MVS DataFacility Product 3.2; the System 36 Workfolder application is September 29,but AS/400 users must wait until March 1990.andP;  Further details of the IBMImagePlus system were given last June in CI Nos 961 and 962.andM;TELEFONICA-BARCELONA MAKES INVESTMENTS TO WELCOME 1992 OLYMPIADandM;Telefonica-Barcelona makes enormous investments to welcome worldandM;to 1992 OlympiadandM;One of the most pressing questions in Spain at the moment with both the 1992Single European Market and the Olympic Games just around the corner, iswhether Telefonica de Espana SA will be able to cope with the country'stelecommunications requirements.andP;  Telefonica-Barcelona's recent annual reportshows that the company has succeeded, in this region, in reducing the waitinglist for lines to 36,951 from 1987's figure of 44,097 and is laboriouslyimproving the service it offers, increasing the rate of installation of linesby 19% while demand went up only 11%.andP;  Furthermore, digital connections wereup 182%, staff increased by 700, while total investment in Barcelona was$309m, up 53% on 1987.andP;  With regard to demand, the most notable increaseswere for services such as X25 (up 99%), cellular phones (up 141%), andIbercom (up 282%), while, in actual traffic, international calls increased by28% and cellular mobile phone calls went up 188%.andP;  In response, Telefonicaincreased the number of X25 ports available by 36%, lines by 34% and fibreoptic cable by 172%.andP;  Looking to the future, Telefonica-Barcelona's budgetfor 1989 comes out at $667m which is 116% up on that for 1988.andP;  The Reportalso mentions Telefonica's main telecommunications projects.andP;  These includethe laying of a ring channel around the Olympic Games stadium and villagearea to enable phone links to be tapped in as required.andP;  Optical fibre cableswill be installed in the channelling to support delivery of speech, data andvideo over Telefonica's network.andP;  Secondly, the Olympic Village is to bereconverted into homes after the Games and Telefonica has recently signed acontract of sale with Barcelona's council for a $1.2m plot in the Villagewhere the telephone company will build its $25.6m &quot;Barcelona-92&quot; telephoneexchange to deal with telecommunications in the north and north-east of thecity both during and after the Games.andP;  The building will consist of twosections, one housing 20,000 digital lines, an Iberpac packet- switchingcentre to connect terminals in the Village to the rest of the network, anIbermic centre for data and image high speed circuit connections and a basestation for the mobile phone and and radiopaging services; the other willhouse the administrative offices and management.andM;Barcelona TeleportandM;The building will also be an international exchange distributing foreignphone traffic from surrounding provinces via optical fibre cable to France,submarine communications (MAT-2 and EMOS cables) to Italy, Greece, Turkey andIsrael, and via TAT-9 cable to the UK, the US and Canada; it will also housethe international transmission and data maintenance centre.andP;  The thirdTelefonica project is the $252m Telecommunications Tower to support all typesof microwave service including Telefonica services, broadcasting of TV and FMservices in the metropolitan area, connection of TV production centres to thebroadcasting centre, interconnection of the mobile TV radio links and a basestation for any type of private radiotelephony.andP;  An earth station for alltypes of international communications via satellite is also planned.andP;  It willhave several parabolic antennae and an advanced satellite tracking system,enabling telegraphy services, high speed data transfer, videoconferences,faxes and TV signals to be provided via Intelsat and Eutelsat.andP;  Other plansinclude, the Barcelona Teleport consisting of a satellite farm with parabolicantennae for the IBS and SMS services via satellites and an annexe building,complete with all the transmission and radio equipment required for thelinking the terrestrial network to the parabolic antennae; a networkmanagement centre with service and supplementary buildings; the TelecomValles Programme for a new telecommunications infrastructure in the Vallesarea which supports Barcelona's technological park and various researchinstitutions; and the creation of a new company to produce and distributeBarcelona Cable TV.andP;  The city will also be connected by fibre optic cable toMadrid, Valencia, and France adding to the province's existing wide areanetwork.andP;  Telefonica- Barcelona's future projects also span promotion anddevelopment of its viewdata service, and, last but not least, the extensionof the basic phone service.andM;BULL TAKES TIGHTER CONTROL OF ITS SPANISH OPERATIONSandM;Bull takes tighter control of its  Spanish operations; CP8andM;card ventureandM;After two years of being overshadowed by the progress of other multinationalsin Spain, Bull Espana SA has reported turnover up 22%.andP;  Now that Bull SA hasfull control of Bull HN, it wants to support its multi-national Europeanmajor accounts more efficiently so as to provide a better service at lesscost to its local subsidiaries.andP;  In Spain, Bull has already teamed up withAmper SA via its subsidiary Bull CP8 for the joint manufacture of Smart Cardsfor payphones (CI No 1,105).andP;  This  project was initiated by Telefonica whichpicked the French company because of Smart Card penetration in the Frenchmarket, and then paid $21.3m for a 10% share in Bull CP8 so that it couldhave a say in its management and marketing.andP;  The resulting factory willassemble chips in the cards and hopes to produce 750,000 cards a year,increasing this to 10,000,000 by 1992.andP;  In addition, Bull has increased itsinvestment in Spain with the acquisition of most of Telesincro SA and the twocompanies are at present working on technology required by the Banca Catalanafor a new electronic payment service using Smart Cards capable of storinglarge amounts of data.andP;  Total investment for this project should be about$20m and Telesincro will manufacture the card readers.andP;  If this system, newon the Spanish market, is as successful as Bull hopes in Catalonia, it willbe extended across the country.andP;  Bull has also been retained by Basqueelectrotechnical group Fagor SA to implement a major automation systemcosting a total $21m over the next five years.andP;  Bull will supply computerequipment and technical assistance and train staff.andP;  The other main Bullmarkets in Spain are government, finance and industry.andM;ARTHUR ANDERSEN AND CENTUNION SET UP ACCENT SAandM;Arthur Andersen manufacturing ventureandM;Arthur Anderson Consulting and Spanish technical and financial co-ordinationcompany Centunion SA have set up a new group, Accent SA to offer acomprehensive assessment and development service for industrial companiesstarting out or updating their production systems.andP;  Formation of the groupwas prompted by the fact that many industrial modernisation programmes faildue to a lack of efficient integration of management and technology.andP;  Atpresent Spain is relatively undeveloped in production process automation inEurope, but plans for the future indicate that investments incomputer-integrated manufacturing will grow 30% annually over the next fewyears, taking it to $4,300m by 1992.andM;SET-BACKS FOR IBM, DEC SPELL MISERY FOR THEIR WEAKER BRETHRENandM;IN THE INDUSTRYandM;Last week's double whammy of bad news, first from IBM and then from DEC maycause a few downcast faces at Armonk and Maynard, but there are other townsthat will be sunk in deepest gloom.andP;  IBM and DEC - and a few othertraditional computer manufacturers like Hewlett-Packard Co and NCR Corp arestrong enough to take emphatic down-turns in the market in their strides.andO;But the last five years of patchy growth left several industry stalwartsgravely weakened, and times are hard and look like getting much harder inMinneapolis, Lowell and Marlborough where Control Data Corp, WangLaboratories and Data General Corp have their domiciles.andP;  Because if thosecompanies were finding profits hard to come by when the market as a whole wasrelatively healthy, the outlook for them in a downturn is grim indeed.andO;Equally threatened is Prime Computer Inc, now expected to report a firstquarter loss that, coupled with an industry recession will make it muchharder for the company to defend itself against the ludicrous hostile bidfrom MAI Basic Four Inc.andP;  Unisys Corp is among the ranks of the strongersecond line companies, but is likely to be hit hard by an industry recessionthat would likely leave it with another year of zero, if not negative, growth- DEC at least is going to grow this year, albeit at a slower rate than overthe last two or three years.andP;  The outlook would be grim too for what used tobe Honeywell Information Systems were it not now a distant branch of theFrench government, which will live with whatever losses the company turns in.andO;With ICL now battening the hatches, all the signs are, as we suggested twoweeks back, that the European market that has pulled so many of IBM'schestnuts out of the fire in recent years, has now gone decidedly soggy, andthe impact on IBM at the top end is likely to be disproportionate if othersfollow National Westminster Bank's example and put price-performance at thetop of their list of requirements and go for Amdahl Corp's 5990 market leaderin the performance stakes (CI No 1,142).andP;  As for DEC, the company is thoughtto have been suffering slow sales of its high-end VAXes - users areimpatiently waiting for the delayed new line-topper, and DEC needs it too, toimprove margins.andP;  Customers are also said to be confused by the differentprice curves on which DEC has put its Ultrix Unix machines and its VMSmachines - the former face such fierce price competition from SunMicrosystems Inc, which is likely to come through any slow-down relativelyunscathed, although a fall in growth and profits will no doubt triggerapocalyptic banner headlines, that DEC has priced them much more keenly thanthe VMS machines, which it still tends to treat as a captive market.andP;  DECfinally came out and admitted that turnover for the third quarter would be$100m to $125m lower than had been expected, leading analysts to trim theirsales growth forecast for the third quarter to 10% from 13%.andP;  There's somecontroversy over the way the information came out through analysts and notdirect from the company, and gung-ho shareholders are no doubt alreadysharpening their lawyers.andP;  DEC's defence is that it has consistently beenmore bearish than analysts about its outlook in the US, and that it can't beheld responsible if analysts don't listen to what it says.andP;  The share pricefinally closed $10.625 down at $96.375 on Wednesday.andM;BRITISH TELECOM WINS THE CONTRACT TO REWIRE ULSTER WITHandM;BRUSSELS BACKINGandM;British Telecommunications Plc and Northern Ireland's Department of EconomicDevelopment has won an award of #7.25m from the European Regional DevelopmentFund to improve Northern Ireland's telecommunications infrastructure.andP;  Theaward is part of the European Community's programme of SpecialTelecommunications Action for Regional Development, STAR.andP;  British Telecomsays it will integrate the investment into an expanded programme for theregion; the award will be used to develop an optical fibre telecommunicationsnetwork within Ulster, the only UK region involved in the STAR programme, andconstruct fibre optic links to Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland.andO;Among the developments to be introduced are special digital equipment at 44locations in Ulster, switched transmissions down phone lines from computer tocomputer, and extensions of advanced data facilities into remote areas ofNorthern Ireland, which would otherwise be unavailable on economic grounds.andO;British Telecom says the investment means improvements to thetelecommunications infrastructure five years earlier than they would haveotherwise been introduced; the company says the STAR measures could cost#100m up to 1992, while the infrastructure implementations, over two years,should secure around 110 jobs.andP;  The STAR programme was set up to improvetelecommunications infrastructures in less developed regions of the EuropeanCommunity.andP;  British Telecom beat Mercury Communications Ltd to the contract;it says the development should give a boost to business in the province, andespecially help the telecommunications needs of small to medium- sizedenterprises.andM;CONSULTING IS WEATHERPROOF, P-E CONFIRMS AS IT LOOKS FORandM;ACQUISITIONSandM;The international management and computer consultants, P-E International ofEgham, Surrey, is living proof of what its chairman Hugh Lang calls the&quot;all-weather quality&quot; of consulting, as it survives the slowing UK market andlooks for acquisitions.andP;  P-E will remain in its four core business areas ofmanagement consulting, information technology, computer services andtechnical services, but intends to develop its portfolio of businesses bothorganically and by acquisition.andP;  It achieved a 35% growth in pre-tax profitsup at #4.5m on turnover that also rose 35% to #48.2m.andP;  The bulk of P-E'srevenue came from the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 43%, with oil,gas and chemicals contributing 19%.andP;  The most rapid revenue growth, however,came from the financial services sector where fees rose 87% to #7.64m.andP;  Inresponse to both the soft UK market and the approach of 1992, the companywithin the past few months has established links with consultancies inDenmark, France, Germany, Italy and Norway giving it access to a network of1,500 staff in Western Europe.andP;  As for the future, P-E points out that&quot;whatever the weather&quot; in the computer industry companies will need adviceeither about handling success or about handling failure.andM;COMPANY RESULTSandM;Adobe Systems Inc has reported first quarter net profit up 95.4% at $7.0m onturnover up 79.5% to $25.5m.andP;

 Thenew software, RTV, real-time video, version 1.5, will be available from firstquarter 1990 in a new Intel chip set.andP;  RTV 1.5 means that motion video can,in a symmetrical process, be captured, compressed and played back inreal-time at 30 frames per second.andP;  The new version of RTV uses a newsoftware compression algorithm running on the i750 chip set.andM;30 frames a secondandM;Version 1 of RTV, which began shipping in April 1988, ran at 10 frames persecond.andP;  This new version will ship in the first quarter of 1990 and will beprovided as a free software upgrade to users of the Pro750 applicationdevelopment system.andP;  The current generation of DVI video processors, i750, iscapable of approximately 12.5 MIPS, while the new processor will be twice aspowerful.andP;  It is expected that the third generation of video chips will befive times more powerful than the second generation.andP;  The chips areprogrammable which means that the application developer can control variousaspects of the compressed video or graphics.andP;  For example, the processor canbe programmed to reduce an application's data rate or to improve imagequality.andP;  It can also be programmed to give the power required by the size ofthe video image to be compressed, as well as for the required image updaterate - this being the rate at which the image on the screen changes orupdates from one frame to the next - although it is recommended that a framerate of 30 per second is adopted since this gives a near video cassetterecorder-quality picture.andP;  Finally, the developer can also specify whatamount of the whole available performance is to be used for videodecompression - the data rate, image size and frame rate - and this will varyfrom application to application.andP;  For example, in a teleconferencingapplication the total processing power would be required for decompression,whereas in an interactive CD-ROM application, only half the processing powermay be required leaving the other half free to manipulate the video in realtime, draw graphics in parallel and so on.andP;  Application developers usingIntel's DVI technology have two options as to how to achieve videocompression: first of all, at a development level, RTV enables programmers tocompress video in real-time in the Pro750 application development system orany DVI system equipped with the video capture option.andP;  This is useful forapplications such as networking and electronic mail where a quick turnaroundis of the essence.andP;  It is also of use for &quot;video notes&quot; in applications suchas spreadsheets and business presentations.andM;By Katy RingandM;Another appropriate area for its use is training and educational applicationswhere instant visual feedback and analysis can prove instrumental in thelearning process.andP;  Indeed, Andersen Consulting's Change Management Servicesdivision swears by RTV 1.0, which it uses in personal computer videoapplications to analyse productivity and accelerate learning curves.andO;Consulting manager of the division, Ziegler, sees a plethora of settings inwhich RTV might be useful, saying, &quot;imagine being able to match your own golfswing to Arnold Palmer's, for example&quot;.andP;  Secondly, RTV can be used as a toolto develop new applications, segments of which can then be replaced withproduction level video processed offline at Intel on a more powerfulparallel-processing computer.andP;  In the future, Intel can foresee a time whenan offline compression function will be available on the developer's desktopgiving higher image quality on-site.andP;  Through such products Intel is hopingto standardise Digital Video Interactive, DVI, technology.andP;  As the technologydevelops, Intel is focussing its development skills on the commercial,government, school and home markets across training, design, information,education and entertainment applications.andP;  While multi-media techniques arealready used in training, Intel points out that as DVI uses a standard CD-ROMformat so that it doesn't suffer from a lack of device interfaces making iteasy to port applications.andP;  In particular Intel sees the new technology aswidening the training market within medicine and defence.andP;  In design itoffers a less expensive personal computer-based alternative to videoproduction and graphics computer systems.andP;  For example, an architecturaldesigner can display a realistic representation of a building without havingto build a physical model, making it easier to evaluate different designs andbuilding materials.andP;  Capitalising on its inexpensive personal computer-basedapproach, DVI is expected to boom in commercial and domestic informationfacilities as well as in home entertainment.andP;  For example, DVI's capabilitiesare currently being explored in a pilot application &quot;Design and Decorate&quot;co-developed with Videodisc Publishing Inc of New York.andP;  Using thisapplication, customers in furniture stores can design their own living room,selecting size and shape, furniture, paint and wall coverings comparing andcontrasting them with fabric coverings and room accessories.andP;  The room can beviewed from a variety of angles and changed on command - the commercial hookbeing that catalogue information is available on-line about the store'savailable furniture and fabrics.andM;Estate agentsandM;Another possible application which estate agents everywhere won't be happyabout is the way the techn logy can be used to show a motion video ofproperties, giving the prospective buyer control of a 360o panoramic view ofthe location.andP;  Aside from curbing the adjectival excesses of estate agentsDVI is also tipped, by Intel, to revolutionise education by enabling thestudent to direct her own learning process rather than being a passiverecipient.andP;  However, whether navigating your own idiosyncratic way roundpredetermined information in a multi-media database is a great improvementover asking teacher is debatable - at least good teachers admit theirfallibility and knowledge limitations.andP;  Such quibbles aside, however, Intelis ploughing ahead with its implementation of DVI and is scheduled toannounce RTV version 2 at the beginning of 1991 which will offer VCR imagequality, while a version 3 should arrive in 1992, promised to be almost be upto TV image resolution.andM;MITAC TAKES COROLLARY'S SYMMETRICAL UNIX TOandM;CHALLENGE COMPAQ WITH SERIES 500andM;The American Mitac arm of Taiwanese Mitac Co introduced its firstmultiprocessor, the tightly coupled 25 MIPS-rated Series 500 at Comdex,aiming it squarely against Compaq Computer's new SystemPro.andP;  The Series 500takes two to seven 25MHz 80386 processors, linked by a Corollary C-Busrunning Corollary's Symmetrical Multiprocessing version of SCO Unix.andP;  In itsminimal two-processor configuration, the 500 is claimed to support up to 16users, expanded to a full seven CPUs, it can handle 160 users, Mitac claims.andO;The system features a dual-bus architecture combining the high-speedCorollary bus, which links CPUs with an AT bus for input-output, enabling the500 to accept existing AT-compatible add-on cards and peripherals.andP;  At itspress conference, Mitac took out after Compaq with a series of comparativeslides.andP;  C K Cheng, Mitac's assistant vice-president of sales and marketing,was quick to point out that the SystemPro was only expandable to two CPUs asagainst Mitac's seven, scored only a peak 40 MIPS against Mitac's 100 MIPSand used the slower write-through cache versus Mitac's write-back technology.andO;Of course, Compaq is using a faster 33MHz chip and offers greater internalmemory: a maximum 256Mb versus only 64Mb.andP;  Its cache per CPU and use of theC-bus, clocking at 16MHz and transmitting at 64Mbytes-per-second, overCompaq's less dynamic EISA bus and loosely coupled architecture.andP;  The series500 also offers 14 slots, six C-bus, five AT-bus and three C- or AT-bus, SCSIand a 500W supply over Compaq's 11 slots, IDA or EISA, and 300W power supply.andO;Mitac says in one-two CPU configuration the 500 will do 6 to 12 MIPS; two tothree CPUs, 15 to 30 MIPS; three to five CPUs, 20 to 50 MIPS and four to sixCPUs, 30 to MIPS.andP;  It compares its cost per MIPS to Compaq's at $1,500 versus$2,000 and tags its entry level cost at $15,000 for two CPUs versus Compaq at$16,000 for a single CPU.andP;  Mitac says it's going to offer the boxes OEM tolarge concerns and sell through its existing distributors and resellers.andP;  The500 goes into full-scale delivery early in 1990.andP;  Mitac also came up with an80486-based Micro Channel machine, expecting an EISA version to follow whenthe EISA chip set is fully tested.andP;  It is beginning full-scale shipment ofits 33MHz 80386 box, the MPC 4000G, and its 25MHz Xenix-based system, theSeries 400.andP;  - Maureen O'GaraandM;ARIX PREPARES 68030-, 68040-BASED THREE MODELandM;SYSTEM 90 MULTIPROCESSOR FOR JANUARYandM;Arix Corp is preparing a January introduction of its next-generation System90, a three-member family of multiprocessor Unix-based systems it designed tomeet the US Treasury Multi-user Acquisition Contract - TMAC - bidspecifications according to president Gene Manno: System 90 will incorporateboth 68030 and 68040 chips.andP;  In keeping with the TMAC specs to lower cost ofownership, users will need to move through only three systems to go from asingle-user desktop system to a top-of-the-line 512-user multiprocessor.andO;Five kinds of peripherals will be supported - read-write and write-onceoptical, CD-ROM - as well as three hard disk formats, 3.5&quot;, 5.25&quot;, and 8&quot;.andO;Software will include the OSF/Motif interface, X Window, and three databases,Oracle, Ingres and Informix.andP;  Cobol and C programming languages andDepartment of Defense B1 level security will also be available.andP;  Networkingwill initially start with TCP/IP and X25, migrating to the OSI/GOSIPspecification as third-parties make it available.andP;  System 90 also figures bigin the company's plans to continue weaning its revenue away fromover-dependence on one large OEM customer, namely Unisys Corp, whose ownearnings are plunging.andM;IXI HAS HIGH HOPES THAT IBM WILL ADOPT X.DESKTOP 2.0 FOR AIXandM;Eager to maintain its frontline position in the battle to supply a desktopmanager for the X Windows System, Cambridge-based IXI Ltd says it has signeda development agreement with IBM for the possible inclusion of its X.desktopproduct in future AIX releases.andP;  IBM was showing version 2.0 of the managerrunning on top of Motif at the recent Unix Expo show in New York, where itwas dubbed AIX.Desktop.andP;  If IBM were to take the thing, (the main oppositionis seen to be Presentation Manager), it would be able to offer a singleinterface across its AIX range, from the PS/2 through the RT and itssuccessor to the 3090s.andP;  Two-year-old IXI, which is 80% owned by itsmanagement and staff, made a $1.5m profit in its first year and has officesin the UK and Boston, Massachusetts.andP;  A West Coast office in Palo Alto,California, will open on January 22, and a Tokyo operation is planned for thenear future.andP;  The next version of X.desktop is set to support multi-taskingand include more adaptive features.andM;DEC LAUNCHES ITS DECMCC NETWORK MANAGEMENT WORKSTATIONandM;DEC has launched the DECmcc Management Station, a network management toolintended for use with a colour graphics screen.andP;  Running the DECmcc underDECWindows with other products in the range, the user can, from a singlelocation, view and manage part or whole of the network and examine thedifferent features of the network by successively opening &quot;windows&quot; on thescreen.andP;  Information such as traffic measurement at a given node on thenetwork is displayed on-screen and individual problems can be highlightedusing a mouse device.andP;  At the moment, the system allows IBM components on thenetwork to be managed as well as proprietary DEC elements; DEC also announcedits intention to supply interfaces supporting the network management tools ofother manufacturers, and to enable the information coming in from thesevarious sources to be integrated into a single database.andM;SIEMENS OFFERS DOCUMENT READING SYSTEMandM;Siemens Data Systems is offering a document-reading system that can scan upto 26,400 hand-written or printed documents per day.andP;  The Allfont 2800 isbuilt around the company's MX 300 Unix micro, and can handle A4, A5 and A6pages - no prices given.andM;CONCEPT OMEGA HAS HIGH EUROPEAN HOPES FORandM;NETWORKED IDOL-IV LANGUAGEandM;Concept Omega Corp of Somerset, New Jersey is making a push towards theEuropean market with a a networked MS-DOS version of its Idol-IV fourthgeneration language.andP;  The company currently derives 30% of its $14m turnoverfrom Europe and believes that this will grow up to 50% in the next two orthree years.andP;  The reason for its optimism stems from its analysis of softwarehouses which divides them into those with a penchant for servers - databasemanagement systems and local area networks, and those whose speciality areclient-based, offering fourth generation  anguages, report generators, screengenerators and so on.andP;  To Concept Omega's eyes, server-oriented houses suchas Oracle Corp, Informix Software Inc, Ashton-Tate Corp and Sybase Inc areopening up their database management systems for products by client-basedhouses, since, according to Concept Omega, these high-end companies arehaving difficulties satisfying their users' fourth generation languagerequirements.andP;  In fact Concept Omega has no interest in mainframes, and hasbeen active in the DEC VAX and Unix systems market for some while.andP;  What itis excited about at the moment is the growing MS-DOS demand for applicationsthat can be ported across hardware and operating systems.andM;VAX, Unix or MS-DOSandM;For, funnily enough, it just so happens that a developer using Idol IV canwrite applications and port them to VAX, Unix or MS-DOS kit without changingthe application code.andP;  Furthermore, Idol IV can be used to develop anapplication on a single-user MS-DOS machine which can then be moved to a2,000-user VAX system.andP;  This is because the new version of Idol-IV iscompatible with the proprietary third generation language Thoroughbred Basic,as well as with multi-user systems running under Unix, Xenix, Ultrix and VMS.andO;Consequently, Idol IV can be used in stand-alone, multi-user and networkedenvironments.andP;  As with similar software products, the marketing stance isthat they reduce the time a company takes to get its applications to market(especially when moving from MS-DOS to Unix), that they give developers moredesign time, and that they enable non-technical industry designers to bedrafted in.andP;  Concept Omega clearly believes that SQL has a role to play inMS-DOS development, since it has also added SQL facilities to its Idol-IVmodule.andP;  Called Query IV, it is Concept's implementation of standard SQL andhas a menu-cursor driven end-user interface to enable inexperienced SQL usersto build up SQL constructs.andP;  Concept Omega's products are available in the UKthrough Romford, Essex-based Professional Computer Solutions and its dealernetwork.andP;  Idol IV is priced at #495 for a single user copy, #1,295 for anetwork version and #1,245 for a full development licence for multi-userconfigurations.andP;  And, versions of Idol IV (which uses natural language) areavailable in French, Spanish and German, as well as in English.andM;CODENOLL HAS BOARDS TO UPGRADE AT-BUS BOXESandM;FROM ETHERNET TO 100MBPS FDDIandM;Codenoll Technology Corp, of Yonkers, New York, has introduced a series of100Mbps FDDI - Fibre Distributed Data Interface - plug-in boards for personalcomputers, a number of FDDI adaptor cards, and a 100 Mbps FDDI ConcentratorSystem.andP;  The new CodeNet-9000 series boards plug into AT bus personalcomputers and support all the major Local Area Networking operating systems,while the CodeNet-9041 Concentrator is used to interconnect minicomputers andmainframes as well as personal computers and workstations using FDDI.andO;Codenoll says that Advanced Micro Devices, Compaq Computer Corp, MicrosoftCorp, Nymex Corp, and The Santa Cruz Operation have announced support forthese new network products, designed for both backbone and workgroupapplications, and claims that they can &quot;provide 10 times the bandwidth ofEthernet at only four times the cost, giving the quickest response time andfastest file transfers available today&quot;.andM;Single slot boardsandM;CodeNet-9540 series and the cheaper CodeNet-9340 series 100Mbps FDDI boardsare single slot boards that connect directly to a Fibre Distributed DataInterface fibre optic ring cable through builtin connectors.andP;  Both the 9540and 9340 boards can connect an AT bus box to a single 100Mbps fibre opticring, and both can be upgraded to enable attachment to dual redundant ringsor dual independent rings with the addition of modular daughter boards.andP;  Thesix different CodeNet-9000 series boards and the CodeNet-9041 ConcentratorSystem can run on the same structured fibre cable plant simultaneously withthe CodeNet fibre optic Ethernet products, with the local net configurationupgradable from 10Mbps Ethernet to 100Mbps FDDI without changing the cableplant.andP;  The CodeNet-954X 100 Mbps FDDI adaptor cards fit 16-bit AT slots andare available in three formats: single MAC/single PHY, single MAC/dual PHY,and dual MAC/dual PHY - a &quot;MAC&quot; being a Medium Access Controller module basedon the AMD SuperNet chip set, while a PHY is a fibre optic transmitterreceiver module based on a combination of AMD chips and Codenoll CodeLinkfibre optic trans-mitter-receiver components.andP;  Each PHY can connect to one100Mbps ring; a dual PHY card connects to two rings for redundancy or twoseparate workstations, while each MAC independently controls a ring.andP;  Themost common single attach adaptor, the single-MAC/single-PHY FDDI ISA board,retails for $5,000.andP;  The retail prices of the CodeNet-95X cards range from$2,800 to $10,000.andP;  CodeNet-935X Series 100Mbps LowCost FDDI plug-in boardsare available in the same configurations.andP;  Apart from the fact that theyoperate at 830 rm optical wavelength over distances of up to 1,000 meters,they are compliant with ISO-9384 and ANSI-FDDI standards.andP;  In the 9340 range,the single MAC/single PHY FDDI ISA board retails for $4,000.andP;  TheCodeNet-934X cards range from $1,800 to $7,800.andP;  A CodeNet-9041 FDDIConcentrator system consists of an AT bus micro, CodeNet-9041 ConcentratorSoftware and a selection of CodeNet-9000 FDDI 100Mbps plug-in boards.andP;

 BlueChip is an information management systems house which grew fat on the back ofthe 1980s construction boom by supplying super-minis to property companies.andO;However, since 1987 it has acquired interests in software packages for avariety of vertical markets including estate agency management, independentschools, service management, and defence industry logistic support.andP;  Duringthe financial year to March 31 1989 Blue Chip made a net profit of #284,000on a turnover hovering below the #5m mark.andP;  Nevertheless as it is stillheavily dependent on the property market with about 80% of its turnovercoming from this sector, it has recently hit serious financial difficultiesand is now running at a loss.andP;  Under the acquisition Blue Chip will become awholly-owned subsidiary of Ferrari.andP;  Its maintenance business will becomeincorporated with that of Ferrari's, but the other parts of the business willprobably remain as a separate division within the group.andP;  Blue Chip will,however, be encouraged to diversify and direct its skills away from thehousing market which is showing no signs of recovery.andP;  The acquisition is fora nominal sum because the vendors are the directors: they are staying withthe company and are being retained by Ferrari under three-year servicecontracts that will be linked to profits.andM;MCI COMMUNICATION IS TO ISSUE UP TO $655M OF ZEROandM;COUPON SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE NOTESandM;MCI Communications Corp is to issue up to $655m of zero coupon subordinatedconvertible notes under a shelf registration statement filed earlier with theUS Securities andamp;
