He insisted he would not budge from hisproposal for raising the current $3.35 hourly minimum wage to$4.25, with a 60-day sub-minimum ``training wage'' for youths.   ``I've got to hold the line. I've got to hold the line on thegrounds of economics (and) on the grounds of making peopleunderstand I was serious about that being the best offer,'' he saidduring a question-and-answer session with members of the AmericanBusiness Conference.   The House has passed legislation to raise the minimum wage to$4.55 by October 1991, with a sub-minimum wage starting at $3.35 tobe paid for 60 days but only for a person's first-ever job. Apending Senate bill would raise the minimum wage to $4.65 inJanuary 1992, and currently has no sub-minimum provision.   Bush's measure would raise the minimum wage to $4.25 by January1992.   ``This is our best shot,'' Bush said. ``I respect and recognizethe positions of ... members of Congress on it. But I've got tostay with this and I'm going to stay with this.''   The president said he would not shy away from using the veto.   ``There will be time when we have to say, look here's what Ibelieve, and then rally our (one) third to defend the president'sposition.'' It takes a two-thirds vote of both chambers to overridea veto.   On another subject, Bush _ who vowed ``no new taxes'' bothduring his campaign and as president _ was asked if he couldsupport a value-added tax on products and services, something likea national sales tax.   ``I don't even want to discuss a tax on consumerism,'' Bushsaid. However, he said that given the hypothetical requirement tochoose between different kinds of taxes, a tax on consumption wouldbe philosophically preferable to one that would sap job creation.   Meanwhile, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush had set upa new White House Council on business competitiveness and assignedVice President Dan Quayle to head it.   Bush had promised to do so in his Feb. 9 budget speech toCongress.   Members of the council will include Attorney General DickThornburgh, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, Treasury SecretaryNicholas Brady, budget director Richard Darman, White House chiefof staff John Sununu and Michael Boskin, chairman of thePresident's Council of Economic Advisers.   Quayle already is chairman of the National Space Council, anEisenhower-era body Bush has reconstructed to explore and promotethe nation's space program.   As part of its mission to improve U.S. business competitiveness,the new council will examine, among other things, governmentregulation and paperwork burdens, Fitzwater said.   He said, however, that it would ``not be a decision-makingbody'' and the panel would instead focus on ``the larger questionsthat bear on competitiveness.''   ``They will determine their own duration and the nature of theirwork,'' the spokesman said, ``so the vice president will give formand substance to this group.''</TEXT></DOC>
