The Scotia Square complex is evaluated as an example of energyefficiency in building design. Biomass conversion is discussed with referenceto various wood burning techniques and methanol production. Biomass solarconversion for systems obtaining low temperature heat are described withemphasis placed on the economics of solar energy use in the Canadiancontext. Finally, wind energy conversion systems are discussed, focusingon verical axis designs and the National Research Council's CANVA turbine.9 refs., 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
