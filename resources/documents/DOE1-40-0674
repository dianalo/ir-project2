Before the introduction of this techniquein 1973, the differentiation between testicular torsion and epididymitiswas frequently impossible on purely clinical grounds. It often requiredscrotal exploration for definitive diagnosis. Although surgical explorationis a relatively benign and very reliable method of diagnosis, scrotalscintigraphy offers a noninvasive and highly reliable means of differentiatinginflammatory processes that do not require surgery, from surgical ischemicconditions of the scrotum. Scintigraphy of the scrotum, however, hasnot been as reliable in the differential diagnosis of pathologic conditionssuch as tumor, abscess, hydrocele, and missed torsion.</TEXT></DOC>
