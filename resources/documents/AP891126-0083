Lack of agreement by the 13-nation Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries could send crude prices tumbling to as low as$15 a barrel in the first quarter of 1990, said one ministerialsource, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Prices could slump even more in the spring _ to $12 a barrel _if a deal is not worked out for the second quarter, he said.   The cartel formally opened its winter strategy session Saturdayto try to come up with an arrangement that would halt productioncheating by some members.   Led by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, OPEC is producingmore than 23 million barrels a day, according to analysts. Itsoutput ceiling now is 20.5 million barrels a day.   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have increased their flow _and violated their output quotas _ to press their demands forlarger shares of OPEC's production pie.   If the ministers can solve the two countries' demands, they seemto feel the output ceiling can be bumped up to 22.5 million barrelsa day in the first half of next year without upsetting the market.   Prices would hold at about their current levels, they believe.   OPEC's target price is $18 a barrel. A basket of crudesmonitored by the cartel recently was $17.76 a barrel.   West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, has beentrading around $20 a barrel. Middle Eastern brands run severaldollars less.   The ministerial source said two main ideas have been floated forresolving the problem of Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, andneither was acceptable to all.   One, advanced by Saudi Arabia and Iran, calls for lettingcountries with more oil produce more. Under this idea, all butheavyweights Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq would give up some oftheir shares to Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, the sourcesaid.   This idea is not palatable to such countries as Algeria,Indonesia and Nigeria, he said, because such countries have seriousmoney woes and depend more heavily on their oil revenues thanothers. To give up some barrels would be difficult.   The alternative would be for all members _ including the oilgiants _ to contribute some of their shares to Kuwait and theUnited Arab Emirates.   Saudi Arabia's influential minister, Hisham Nazer, has saidrepeatedly his country will not reduce its quarter share of totaloutput.   Iran's Gholamreza Aqazadeh also has put his foot down, accordingto the source.   Officials are taking a look at various scenarios and jugglingfigures to see if these options could resolve their problems.   If not, the ministers have a ``fallback'' option, said thesource. They could divide any increase in the production ceiling,say a million barrels a day, proportionately among the 13 countries.   Such a decision, though, would not satisfy Kuwait and the UnitedArab Emirates. The two would continue producing more than they areallotted and keep production high, thus prices could weaken.</TEXT></DOC>
