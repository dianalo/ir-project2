While more than 100 immigrants lined up today to apply forpolitical asylum, six people, including three nuns, began a fastoutside the detention facility in protest of the new Immigration andNaturalization Service policy.   ``We don't plan to finish this fast until we have a specificanswer'' from the U.S. government, said Jose Amaya, a Salvadoranresident-alien.   Amaya said the group was demanding refugee status for Salvadoranaliens and an end to U.S. military aid to their country. Theirprotest was in front of the INS' Port Isabel Service ProcessingCenter, a 315-acre detention facility 15 miles northeast ofBrownsville where asylum applications are taken.   On Monday, Alan C. Nelson, commissioner of the INS office here,said the federal agency will speed up its processing of asylumapplications and take a tough line on ``frivolous'' claims.   For months, local elected officials have called on the federalgovernment to relieve the burden placed on their communities byhomeless Central Americans.   ``From the standpoint of the city, I think it will be good interms of taking people and providing for them in a humanitarianway,'' said Brownsville Mayor Ygnacio Garza, whose city is Texas'southernmost.   The INS plan, which will take several weeks to phase in, willbring more than 500 federal workers to the Brownsville area. Theagency will add 269 people to its 375-member Border Patrol betweenDel Rio and Brownsville, a stretch of more than 300 miles. It alsowill increase its staff of asylum adjudicators in Brownsville from16 to 74.   Immigrants who apply for asylum but don't qualify will be placedin detention centers. If necessary, the INS will build a tent citycapable of holding up to 5,000 detainees, officials said.   Harlingen Mayor Bill Card, whose city on Feb. 10 evicted the INSfrom its asylum-processing office over alleged health and safetyviolations, described the plan as a ``good initial first step.''   But advocates for the immigrants decried the plan.   Brownsville immigration attorney Linda Yanez said a lengthyappeals process, a shortage of qualified attorneys and cloggedimmigration court dockets will mean lengthy detention for many underthe new procedure.   ``I think we're going to see detention (for) years,'' said Ms.Yanez.   A group called the Brownsville Ad Hoc Refugee Committeecriticized the new policy as a ``mean-spirited attempt to deterpolitical refugees from applying for political asylum.''   Several local churches helped provide bus tickets for CentralAmericans who had until midnight Monday to leave the area legally,said Mervin Mosbacker Sr. of Church World Service, a non-profitinterdenominational relief group.   Since Jan. 9, the INS has been prohibited by a court order fromrestricting the travel of asylum seekers, many of whom go toCalifornia or Florida. The restraining order expired today.   The adjudication and detention plan announced Monday could nothave been implemented had the order been in place.   Nelson said he hoped the plan would slow the wave of immigrationhe said threatened to ``empty out'' Central America.   ``We think people (will) realize in Central America that it's notworth spending your life savings to pay a smuggler to get you intothe United States because you will not get to stay and work here ifyou do not have a legal basis to come,'' he said.   Those denied under the new plan will be placed in deportationproceedings, held in INS custody and will appear before immigrationjudges, where they may resubmit asylum cases.   Previously, Central Americans who were denied asylum were given30 days to leave the country.   Single adults will be held in INS detention centers, Nelson said.The INS will put family groups and unaccompanied minors under lessrestrictive custody in shelters operated by the Justice Department'sCommunity Relations Service, where they must report for daily rollcalls.   Detention facilities listed in the plan include 1,100 beds at theINS' Port Isabel Service Processing Center, 200 in Laredo and 200 inEl Paso.   Nelson said a tent camp might be built for up to 5,000 people atthe Port Isabel center if the population continues to accumulate.   At the current rate, the INS estimates that 100,000 CentralAmericans this year would pass through the Brownsville area, themain entry point for asylum seekers from that region.   In the recent past, the U.S. has provided political asylum toNicaraguans in particular, but the INS maintains that most CentralAmerican immigrants do not qualify because they are seeking bettereconomic conditions rather than fleeing political persecution.</TEXT></DOC>
