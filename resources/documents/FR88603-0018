Revisions to the content of the regulationsare designed to increase the focus on the provision of active treatmentservices for clients, clarify Federal requirements, and maintain essentialclient protections.

Background</ITAG>GeneralSection 1905(a)(15) of the Social Security Act (the Act) authorizes optionalMedicaid coverage for services in intermediate care facilities (ICFs).These are facilities that provide health-related care to individuals whodo not need the degree of care commonly provided in hospitals or skillednursing facilities, but who do require care and services above the levelof room and board that can only be made available to them through institutionalfacilities. Section 1905(d) of the Act indicates that the term ``intermediatecare facility services'' may include services in a public institution forthe mentally retarded or persons with related conditions (ICF/MR). (Privatefacilities may also participate as ICFs/MR.)Fifty States and jurisdictions currently cover ICF care; 49 of these includeICF/MR care and serve over 154,000 individuals in over 3,600 ICFs/MR, rangingin size from 4 beds to almost 1,500 beds.ICF/MR Standards_Current RegulationsCurrent standards for ICFs/MR are found at 42 CFR Part 442, Subpart G.These standards were published in 1974 and are based primarily on the 1971voluntary standards of the Accreditation Council for Facilities for theMentally Retarded (AC/FMR), now renamed the Accreditation Council on Servicesfor People with Developmental Disabilities (ACDD). The standards are therequirements that ICFs/MR must meet in order to participate in the Medicaidprogram. They were developed on the assumption that they would be usedfor the most part in large, public institutions which served as the principalsource of out of the home placement of persons with mental retardationat the time the standards were published. Since the early 1970s, litigation,legislation, research and technological advances have influenced the wayin which clients are identified, assessed, and provided services. The sizeof institutions has steadily decreased and the provision of a broad spectrumof services to clients in community settings has expanded greatly in thelast 10 years. Despite these changes, the standards have not been significantly revisedsince they were originally published in 1974. On March 4, 1986, we publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(51 FR 7520) a proposed revision of the standards.The changes we proposed were designed to increase the focus on the provisionof active treatment services to clients, clarify Federal requirements,maintain essential client protections, and to provide State survey agencieswith a more accurate mechanism for assessing quality of care.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations</ITAG>We based our proposal, particularly the Active Treatment Services sectionof our proposed standards, primarily on the accreditation standards publishedin 1983 by the ACDD. We based our revisions on the following general principles:andbullet; The standards should enable both the facility and monitoring agencies(State survey agencies and Federal reviewers) to form judgments about whetherindividuals needs are being properly assessed and appropriate interventionsplanned and delivered.andbullet; The standards should be applicable to all of the various sizesof facilities that provide services to persons with mental retardationand should provide these facilities with greater flexibility in the administrationof their programs.andbullet; The standards should focus more on client and staff performancerather than on compliance with processes and paper requirements.andbullet; The standards should provide for individual client protections,given the vulnerability and frequent isolation of many clients in ICFs/MR.The major organizational and structural proposed revisions to the standardswere as follows:andbullet; We proposed to reorganize the standards into four major sectionsin order to eliminate duplicative language and provide the facilities andsurveyors with a logical, accountable method of determining compliance.The four sections that we proposed were: administrative services; activetreatment services; physical environment; and, safety and sanitation.andbullet; We proposed revisions to much of the detailed language of thecurrent standards to give facilities greater ability to administer theirprograms, while recognizing their widely varying sizes, locations and organizationalstructure. We proposed retaining appropriate detail in the areas of neededclient protections.andbullet; We proposed rewording much of the language contained in the currentregulations to reflect contemporary terminology in the field of developmentaldisabilities. For example, we proposed to substitute the term ``client''for ``resident'' throughout the standards.andbullet; We proposed to retain necessary emphasis on health services, butincluded revisions that would reflect the wide diversity in health caredelivery systems utilized by ICFs/MR.andbullet; The proposed standards emphasized the development of the individualclient in defining the active treatment process. We used the ACDD standardsfor active treatment as a guide and proposed to link professional qualificationsand duties to the active treatment process.andbullet; We proposed to clarify numerous existing standards that have createdproblems for providers and reviewers (for example, qualifications for thequalified mental retardation professional, thermostatically controlledwater faucets, self-administration of medications, and the applicationof State nursing home health and sanitation standards).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion of Comments</ITAG>We received 236 timely items of correspondence in response to the proposednotice. Comments were received from individuals, associations, State healthdepartments and Medicaid providers of services (primarily, ICFs/MR). Withfew exceptions, HCFA's efforts to develop a performance based regulationwere commended by commenters as a ``step in the right direction''. Yet,many of these same commenters offered suggestions that would have the effectof increasing the amount of prescriptive, process oriented requirementswe sought to eliminate in the proposal. One commenter, representing a largenumber of small providers, noted that ``we are particularly appreciativeof efforts to offer more flexibility to service providers in the proposedrules, and it is with a sense of irony that we find we will be recommendinga diminution of that flexibility * * *''.Our experiernce with the ICF/MR regulations, first published in 1974, hasprovided sufficient evidence of the failure of essentially prescriptive,process oriented regulations to work effectively in behalf of the developmental,health, social, and behavioral needs of clients. We remain committed tothe principles on which we based the proposal and have rejected many ofthe suggestions that we think only ``reload'' prescriptive requirementsthat we sought to eliminate. Thus, our response to many comments in thefollowing sections will say simply that we rejected them as being ``tooprescriptive''. While we appreciate the thoughtfulness and sincerity ofthe commenters, we disagree with the rationale behind many of these suggestions.A summary of the comments and our responses to them, follows.A. Condition of Participation Format<T3>Comment: </T3>We requested comments on the issue of organizing theseregulations into the condition of participation format. Approximately 50commenters expressed views on the issue. Under such an approach, Stateagencies would survey for compliance with the conditions of participation.We note that a condition is often made up of several ``standards''. Inorder for the condition to be met, all or a majority of the standards mustbe met. Thus, a facility is found to meet <T3>all </T3>the conditions of participation, it would be eligible forMedicaid certification. If a facility meets all the conditions of participation,but has deficiencies in one or more of the standards comprising a conditionof participation, it has up to 12 months to achieve compliance in conformitywith a corrective plan of action (provided that the deficiencies do notimmediately jeopardize the health and safety of the facility's clients,in which case the facility's certification must be terminated as set forthunder andSection; 442.117).About two thirds of the commenters on this issue were in favor of the conditionof participation format. Almost all of these commenters favored the conditionformat because they believed that it would lead to more enforceable requirements.However, many deplored the idea that a facility could operate for 12 monthswith standard level deficiencies simply by having a plan of correctionin existence.The other third of the commenters on this issue opposed the condition ofparticipation format because they believe that the structure of the conditionformat is such that the change for deficiencies to result in adverse actionis increased. Thus, the commenters believe the condition format would sharplyincrease the facility's vulnerability to adverse action. They assertedthat since there is no empirical basis for establishing minimum thresholdsof compliance within any of the suggested conditions, the decision of thesurveyor would be no less subjective under the condition of participationthan under the standards format, but the potential penalty would be greater.Response: We have adopted the condition of participation format in thesefinal regulations. While we appreciate the view that an empirical basisfor deciding when a standard or a condition is out of compliance is conceptuallypossible, we believe that approach could lead to an even less desirablecircumstance. If minimum requirements for taking adverse action were established,very little professional judgment would be necessary and compliance decisionscould be made without regard to the human factors or circumstances of theclients. For example, a requirement that 25 percent of the clients meet40 percent of the objectives established in their individual plans of care,does not take into consideration the fact that the failed objectives maynot have been the most important for those clients. Judgment of the qualityof human services will always be to some extent subjective. While we willcontinue to strive to develop clear and precise regulations and surveytechniques, we always will need to rely heavily upon surveyors who canmake judgments about the human factors or circumstances relative to a consensusstandard established as administrative law.The condition of participation format, which originated in the Medicareprogram, is a format structured to assure that facilities that do not meetat least minimum requirements do not participate in the program. The conditionof participation format enables us to define the critical major requirementsfor participation. If the facility is performing so poorly as to warranta determination that one or more conditions of participation are not met,then we believe the facility does not meet the requirements for participationin the ICF/MR program, namely that the facility is providing needed servicesin a safe and healthful environment. In developing the conditions of participation format, we decided that theconditions for ICFs/MR would be located most appropriately in 42 CFR SubchapterE, ``Standards and Certification''. Subchapter E currently includes theconditions of participation for hospitals and specialized providers. Inthis final rule, we have established under Subchapter E a new Part 483,``Conditions of Participation for Long Term Care Facilities''. The outlineof the condition of participation format that we have adopted in this finalrule follows. In the outline, we have indicated which sections of the proposedrule were used in establishing the conditions.<ITAG tagnum="26">andSection; 483.400 Basis and purpose. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">andSection;

Basis and Purpose (Proposed andSection; 442.400; Final andSection; 483.400)<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter objected to the word ``facility'' in thestatement that describes the Secretary's authority to prescribe standardsfor ``intermediate care facility services''. The commenter thought theword facility focused too much on physical plant issues rather than onclient services. Response: In this context, the word facility is used as it appears in thestatute (section 1905(d) of the Act) that establishes the ICF/MR benefitunder the Medicaid program. The context in which it appears makes it clearthat it is ``facility services'' that are covered, and it is clearly servicesthat are emphasized in these regulations. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters wanted to maintain the provisionsof the current regulations at andSection; 442.402 that require a facilityto establish philosophy, objectives and goals, and andSection; 442.407 thatrequires a facility to have policy and procedure manuals. Response: In the proposal and in these final regulations, we have emphasizedthe outcomes of care for the client. The facility's philosophy, policies,and procedures are essential to its successful operation. However, we intendto measure facility performance, and this is what we expect to see reflectedin client outcomes. C. Protection of Clients Rights (Proposed andSection; 442.401; Final andSection;483.420(a)) <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters recommended that paragraphs (i), (j)and (k) of the proposed andSection; 442.401 concerning the protection ofclient rights be modified by replacing the word ``permit'' with the phrase``ensure that''. The commenters believed that this would emphasize thatthe rights discussed in these paragraphs are basic and that the facilitydoes not have the right to deny them as the word ``permit'' suggests. Response: We accept this recommendation and have revised the regulationsaccordingly. <T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters expressed a variety of opinions regardingthe absence in the proposed regulations of the existing requirement atandSection; 442.405 that states that a qualified mental retardation professionalmay determine if a client is incapable of understanding his or her rights.Many commenters also suggested that the proposed andSection; 442.401(a) thatlists the individuals a facility must inform of clients' rights, be amendedto include a legal advocate as one who must be informed. Similarly, othersstated that it should be mandated that when a client is adjudicated incompetent,a legal guardian be appointed. Still others wanted to expand the proposedsection by adding a new subsection detailing clients' rights in obtaininga legal advocate. Response: The reason that the proposal and this final rule delete the authorizationfor a qualified mental retardation professional to determine a client'scompetency is that this determination involves a judicial process thatgoes beyond a clinical process. With respect to the issue of informinga legal advocate of a client's rights, there is nothing in the proposalor the final rule to preclude notification. Regarding the mandating ofa legal guardian in the case of incompetency, this is a matter traditionallyregulated under State laws. Finally, neither the proposal nor the finalrule preclude a facility from obtaining a legal advocate for a client,but we have no authority to mandate his or her appointment. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters asked whether the proposed andSection;442.4019b), which would require a facility to inform each client, parentor guardian of the attendant risks of treatment, referred to medical treatmentexclusively or other modalities as well. Response: The term ``attendant risks of treatment'' refers to all treatment.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters asked if there was conflict between theproposed andSection; 442.401(b), which would establish a client's right torefuse treatment, and the facility's mandate to provide active treatment.Response: We will explain in interpretive guidelines that a client refusinga particular treatment must be offered acceptable alternatives to the treatmentbeing refused if acceptable alternatives are available (for example, drugtherapy). If the client refuses the alternative treatment as well, or ifno alternative exists to the treatment that was refused, the facility mustconsider whether it can continue to treat the client consistent with theseregulations. <T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters suggested that the proposed andSection; 442.401(i)that would establish a client's right to send and receive mail be modifiedto indicate that a client has a right to send and receive unopened mail.Response: We agree and have modified the regulations to indicate that aclient has this right. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the proposed andSection; 442.401(g)that would require a facility to provide each client with the opportunityfor personal privacy be expanded to indicate the locations where privacyis a client right. Response: We believe this is conceptually self-evident. We cannot enumerateall of the types of living environments that lend themselves to clientprivacy, so we cannot practically comply with this recommendation. However,we have modified the regulations to emphasize the need for privacy duringtreatment procedures and care of the personal needs of the client.D. Client Finances (Proposed andSection; 442.410; Final andSection; 483.420(b))<T3>Comment: </T3>Most commenters on the requirement to keep a full andcomplete accounting of clients personal funds were concerned that a minutelydetailed accounting by the facility should not be required. Clients' personalfunds include funds for ``incidental'' expenses (such as ice cream andbus fares), funds that a capable client handles without assistance, fundsdispensed to a client under a program to train the client in money management,and funds that are not entrusted to the facility (for example, that arepaid directly to the client's representative payee). Response: The Conference Report (H.R. Rep. No. 673, 95th Cong., 1st Sess.49 (1977)) on the bill that enacted section 1861(j)(14) of the Act, theprovision that requires skilled nursing facilities to account for patients'funds, states that: `Such system must provide for separate and discreteaccounting for each patient with a complete accounting of income and expenditures.'The requirement for ICFs to account for patients' funds was incorporatedinto the Medicaid statute at section 1905(c) of the Act, by section 8(a)of Pub. L. 95-292. However, we agree with the commenters who maintain that the facility shouldnot be held responsible for personal funds used for incidental expensesor ``pocket money''. Consequently, we have restated the requirement, nowat andSection; 483.420(b)(1)(i) to clarify that the facility is only responsiblefor the personal funds of which it has custody on behalf of the client.<T3>Comment: </T3>Some commenters suggested that specific emphasis be placedon the facility's responsibility to encourage and teach clients to managetheir own funds to the extent possible. Response: We believe that the need to encourage and train clients in managingtheir own funds to the extent possible was reflected in the proposed andSection;442.401(d) that would require the facility to allow each client to managehis or her own financial affairs and to teach him or her to do so to theextent of the client's capabilities. Consequently, we have made no changeto the proposed requirement in this final rule. We note that the requirementis located at andSection; 483.420(a)(4) in this final rule. <T3>Comment: </T3>Other commenters recommended that we retain the requirementin current regulations at andSection; 442.404(a)(4) that the facility informthe client in writing of available services and any applicable charges.Response: The ICF/MR is required to provide its clients with the packageof services specified in these regulations. Further, Medicaid regulationsat andSection; 447.15 provide that, except for any recipient cost-sharingrequirements specified by the State plan, a Medicaid provider must acceptthe amount paid by the State Medicaid program as payment in full. Thus,the facility is effectively precluded from charging the client for servicesthat it provides as part of the required ICF/MR package, making a listof applicable charges unnecessary. <T3>Comment: </T3>Concerning the proposed andSection; 442.410(a), which wouldpreclude the commingling of a client's funds with any funds other thanthose of another client, two commenters suggested the commingling of clients'funds in a shared trust fund, noting that small, individual client savingsaccounts can be depleted by bank charges. However, they added that it wouldbe impossible to maintain individual running accounts of interest accruedto each client in a shared account.Response: The proposed rule that would prohibit the commingling of clients'funds with facility funds is required by section 1905(c)(4) of the Act,which incorporates section 1861(j)(14) of the Act. Section 1861(j)(14)of the Act precludes the commingling of clients' funds in skilled nursingfacilities that are approved for Medicare participation. Thus, under section1905(c)(4), this provision applies to ICFs. There is nothing in the Actthat requires the facility to maintain clients' personal funds in financialinstitutions in accounts separate from other client accounts, or to maintainthese funds in interest bearing accounts (although it would ordinarilybe prudent to do so). However, if the facility elects to pool clients'funds in an interest bearing account, it is expected to know the interestseparately accrued by each client, as part of its required accounting offunds. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned the need for any comminglingof clients' funds, and opposed any system that could allow personal fundsto lose their individual identity, or allow access to them without consentof the client or guardian. Another suggested allowing combined funds withina shared bank account but mandatory, separate accounting cost centers foreach client. Still another commenter noted a potential conflict betweenFederal law and a particular State's law requiring interest from a patient'strust account to be deposited into a common recreational fund account.Response: Section 1905(c)(4) of the Act, the proposed regulations, andthese final regulations neither require nor prohibit the commingling ofa client's funds with those of other clients in accounts in financial institutions,nor do they require that funds, when deposited, be deposited in interestbearing accounts. With regard to the potential conflict between State andFederal law, we would have to examine the specifics of the State law todetermine whether, in fact, it conflicts with the Federal Medicaid statute.<T3>Comment: </T3>In regard to the proposed andSection; 442.410(b), whichwould require a written financial record that includes management of allfunds handled by the facility on the client's behalf, one commenter suggestedincluding a signed statement that the facility management of funds is doneat the client's option, and another expressed support for the requirementfor a written financial record. Response: We believe the issue of a client authorizing the facility tomanage his or her funds was already adequately addressed in the proposedandSection; 442.401(d) concerning clients' rights. That section would requirethat the client be allowed to manage his or her own financial affairs asmuch as possible, and implied that facility management of the client'sfunds is possible only if the client elects it. We have made no changesto this provision that now is located at andSection; 483.420(a)(4). We believethat the requirement in the introductory paragraph of the proposed andSection;442.410, for a full and complete accounting of funds, by its nature necessitatesmaintenance of a written record. Therefore, we believe that the languagein the proposed andSection; 442.410(b) that would specifically require awritten record is unnecessary, and we have deleted it. <T3>Comment: </T3>With respect to the proposed provision regarding availabilityof the financial record (andSection; 442.410(c) of the proposal), eight commentersrecommended that the word ``and'' in the phrase ``to the client and hisor her parents or guardian'' be changed to ``or'', noting that a parentor guardian should not have automatic access to the financial record ofan adult client who can manage his or her own finances. Several additionalcommenters suggested that instead of changing ``and'' to ``or'', the words``as appropriate'' be added to the end of the sentence. It was noted thateven a client who has been adjudicated as incompetent should have the opportunityto examine his or her own financial record. Requiring the record to bemade available to the client ``or'' the parent or guardian might be interpretedas precluding this opportunity. Response: We agree with the commenters who point out that parents shouldnot have automatic access to the financial records of adult clients whocan manage their own finances. Therefore, we are revising the last partof the sentence to read `` * * * client, parents (if the client is a minor),or legal guardian''. This wording adequately addresses the general issueof access to the client's financial records. <T3>Comment: </T3>Some commenters suggested requiring the facility to furnishthe client and family with an annual financial statement. Response: We do not believe it is necessary to require a facility to furnishan annual financial statement to the client or the client's family, sincethe facility is already required to make the financial record availableat any time upon request. Requiring an annual statement could create theerroneous impression that the facility need only make the record availableonce a year and may impose, as well, a reporting burden not desired byfamily members or guardians.<T3>Comment: </T3>Other commenters recommended requiring the financialrecord to be available, at the client's request, to a designated advocateand requiring that financial records be made available to those with alegal right to the information (which would not necessarily include theparent or guardian) and to the client ``unless contraindicated''.Response: We do not believe that it is necessary to make explicit referenceto third parties designated by clients to represent them, such as advocates.The facility already is required to make the record available to the clientwho, in turn, can elect to make it available to any other individual ofthe client's choice. This election also can be made by the client's parents(if the client is a minor) or legal guardian on the client's behalf.E. Governing Body (Proposed andSection; 442.412; Final andSection; 483.410(a))<T3>Comment: </T3>Most of the comments on this section concerned the provisionin the proposed paragraph andSection; 442.412(b) that would require ``knowledgein the field of developmental disabilities'' as one of the qualificationsof the facility administrator. Many commenters requested clarificationon how possession of this knowledge can be established (degree, years ofexperience, etc.). Some questioned the need for this requirement and expressedthe belief that organizational skills, as well as managerial/administrativeexperience and training, are the most important qualifications for theadministrator.Response: After reviewing the comments regarding this requirement, we havedecided to delete it. It would be difficult to formulate definitive, all-inclusivecriteria for demonstrating this type of knowledge and experience. We believethat the presence of sufficient knowledge, experience and managerial skillsin the field of developmental disabilities will be reflected in the qualityof care furnished to clients in the facility. Therefore, the most appropriateindicators in assessing this factor will be outcome-oriented; that is,the quality of care that the clients actually receive.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that we revise the regulationsto clarify that it is permissible for more than one facility to share acommon administrator or governing body.Response: Neither the proposed nor these final regulations preclude suchan arrangement as long as the administrator adequately fulfills the functionsand responsibilities required to manage each facility (or, in the caseof a governing body, as long as the governing body meets the specific requirementsset out in the standard for governing bodies at andSection; 483.410(a) foreach of the facilities involved).<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that we keep the requirementin current regulations at andSection; 442.408 for a management audit plan.Response: We did not include the requirement for a management audit planin the proposal or in this final rule. The reason is that we believe thatthe existence of a plan is not an appropriate measure of whether its functionhas been fulfilled and that each facility should determine for itself,either in advance or continously, the manner in which it monitors its ownperformance.F. Communications With Clients, Parents, and Guardians (Proposed andSection;442.412; Final andSection; 483.420(c))<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters suggested that we maintain the provisionin current regulations at andSection; 442.414(a)(1) that requires a facilityto notify parents or guardians of any significant in the client's condition.Response: This requirement was addressed in the proposed andSection; 442.434that would require the facility to notify the client's parents or guardianpromptly of any significant incidents. In the final regulations, this provisionis located at andSection; 483.420(c)(6). It requires facilities to notifypromptly the client's parents or guardian of any significant incidentsor changes in the client's condition. For a further discussion of the provision,see section III.P. of this preamble.<T3>Comment: </T3>The proposed andSection; 442.414 included an introductorystatement that would require the facility to have an active program ofcommunication with the client, parents, and guardian. Some commenters suggestedthat the word ``and'' be change to ``or'', to allow for direct communicationbetween the facility and a competent adult client rather than through theclient's parents.Response: The proposed introductory statement was not intended to establishan explicit requirement, but rather to set the general tone of the requirementsthat follow it. Since it causes confusion as to its intent, we have revisedit to say simply, ``The facility must_''. As in the proposed rule, theintroductory statement of this final rule is followed by specific requirements.<T3>Comment: </T3>Other commenters suggested that we replace the word ``permit''as used in this section with ``promote,'' to indicate a more active facilityrole in enabling clients to exercise their basic rights.Response: We agreed with the commenters and, in this standard, have replacedthe word ``permit'' with ``promote'' to emphasize the facility's activerole in the communications process. We plan to issue interpretive guidelinesthat will clarify that this revised wording places a higher degree of responsibilityon the facility in this area.<T3>Comment: </T3>The proposed andSection; 442.414(a) would require the facilityto permit participation of parents and guardians in the active treatmentprocess specified in the proposed andSection; 442.440, unless that participationis unobtainable or inappropriate. Many commenters requested clarificationof the term ``inappropriate'' and of the process by which parental or guardianparticipation in the client's active treatment plan would be determinedto be inappropriate or unobtainable. Additional commenters asked whetherthe term ``active treatment'' in this context is synonymous with ``individualprogram plan''.Response: In this final rule, we have deleted the cross-reference to andSection;442.440 concerning active treatment, and have revised the language to referto ``the process of providing active treatment to a client''. This is toclarify that the facility must promote parent/guardian participation inthe entire range of activities connected with the provision of active treatment,from client assessment through delivery. Regarding the terms ``inappropriate''and ``unobtainable'', we plan to issue interpretive guidelines to clarifythat, for example, it would be inappropriate for an individual to attendinterdisciplinary team meetings if his or her behavior is so disruptiveor uncooperative as to preclude effective participation by anyone else.Similarly, the term ``unobtainable,'' as used in this standard, means thatthe facility had made a bona fide effort to <T3>seek </T3>parental participation in the client's active treatment process,even though the effort may ultimately be unsuccessful (for example, theparent may be impossible to locate, or may prove unwilling or unable toparticipate).<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters expressed concern that unannouncedvisits to the client (proposed at andSection; 442.414(c)) or to areas ofthe facility that provide direct client care services (proposed at andSection;442.414(d)) should not be allowed to interfere with or disturb the privacyand rights of that or any other client.Response: We share this concern, and have amended the language to providefor visits ``consistent with the right of that client's and other client'sprivacy''.<T3>Comment: </T3>Over half the commenters addressing the proposed andSection;442.414(e) noted that, although the proposed regulations would requirefacilities to permit frequent and informal leaves of absence, State Medicaidprograms often make no or very limited payment to reserve the client'sbed in the facility during the leave of absence.Response: Under the Medicaid program, payment during a leave of absenceis a matter for each State to decide. The Medicaid regulations governingpayment during leaves of absence (at andSection; 447.40) provide that eachState is free to determine whether and to what extent it will make paymentin these situations. Of course, Federal matching funds are available whenevera State decides to make such payments under the regulations.<T3>Comment: </T3>Other commenters suggested that a leave of absence shouldnot be permitted in situations in which the interdisciplinary team determinesthat it would be inconsistent with the client's program goals (such aswhen a home visit would be potentially harmful).Response: The proposed regulations would and these final regulations dorequire the facility to permit clients to go on visits and trips. A facilityis not required to sponsor such trips or to allow the client to take aparticular type of trip that is contraindicated. If a specific type oftrip is contraindicated by a particular circumstance (for example, childabuse by a parent), then the facility is not required to permit such trips.However, as with any right that may need to be modified or limited, theclient should be provided with the least restrictive and most appropriatealternative available. We note that in the final rule under the standardconcerning the protection of clients' rights at andSection; 483.420(a)(3),we have clarified the proposed requirements on a client's exercise of rights,by including the example of a client's right to due process.<T3>Comment: </T3>Some commenters suggested deletion of the word ``frequent''with reference to leaves of absence, to make clear that the regulationsdo not apply to facilities that provide only part-time, non-residentialcare.Response: We are retaining the word ``frequent'', since these regulationsapply only to inpatient facilities and, therefore, clearly do not includethose facilities which provide only part-time care.G. Compliance With Federal, State, and Local Laws (Proposed andSection; 442.416;Final andSection; 483.410(b))<T3>Comment: </T3>A number of commenters expressed approval of the inclusionof civil rights requirements in this provision. However, there were alsoquestions as to whether the applicability of civil rights requirementsincluded accessibility for the handicapped under section 504 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973.Response: The provisions of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,including accessibility for the physically handicapped, apply to all programsreceiving Federal funds. The Office for Civil Rights of the Departmentof Health and Human Services administers the regulations implementing section504 relative to building accessibility for the physically handicapped andis routinely involved in the certification process for ICFs/MR. Becausethe proposed regulations text at andSection; 442.416 gave the appearancethat HCFA would be enforcing civil rights and research requirements, wehave deleted these requirements from the text. However, we have added anew andSection; 483.405 which describes the relationships between these regulationsand those administered by other HHS agencies (for example, nondiscriminationon the basis of age administered by the Office of Civil Rights). Violationsof these regulations, while not a condition of participation, may resultin the termination or suspension of, or refusal to grant or continue, Federalfinancial assistance.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter believes that there is an inconsistencybetween the proposed standard at andSection; 442.416, which would requirethat the facility comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws,and the proposed revision in the regulations at andSection; 442.252 thatwould exempt ICFs/MR from meeting State nursing home regulations.Response: The current andSection; 442.252 requires all ICFs to meet Stateimposed safety and sanitation standards for nursing homes. These State-imposednursing home requirements are not always appropriate to ICFs that servethe mentally retarded. Thus, we proposed to limit the applicability ofandSection; 442.252 to ICFs other than ICFs/MR. We see no inconsistency betweenthe proposed amendments to andSection; 442.252 and the proposed andSection;442.416 that would require facility compliance with Federal, State andlocal laws that are ``applicable'' to ICFs/MR. In order to further clarifythat these regulations do not require State-imposed safety and sanitationstandards for nursing homes to be applied to ICFs/MR, we considered movingandSection; 442.252 from Part 442, Subpart E that applies to all facilities,to Subpart F that applies only to ICFs other than ICFs/MR. However, thecurrent rules under Subpart F already address safety and sanitation lawsat andSection; 442.315(c). Therefore, in this final rule, we are deletingandSection; 442.252. Thus, these regulations do not require States to applyState nursing home requirements with regard to safety and sanitation standardsto ICFs/MR. However, a State continues to be free to apply State ICF/MRstandards and, if it does, the facility is required by andSection; 483.410(b)of these regulations to comply with those State requirements. These regulationsimpose Federal safety and sanitation requirements on ICFs/MR at andSection;483.470 and elsewhere.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked how to determine which provisionwould be controlling in situations where two or more applicable requirementsconflict.Response: We believe the commenters may be referring to a perceived conflictbetween the proposed andSection; 442.416, which requires compliance withFederal, State and local laws, and the proposed andSection; 442.460, whichdescribes personnel qualifications. It is possible that a State may requireone level of qualification for personnel (for example, doctoral) and theFederal regulations require a lower level (for example, bachelors). Infact, this does not represent a conflict because the regulations representthe basic minimum participation requirements. If a State permits licensurewith lower requirements, these Federal regulations control for purposesof Medicaid certification. If, on the other hand, a State imposes higherrequirements, the facility must in effect meet the higher of the two requirements.H. Provision of Needed Services (Proposed andSection; 442.418; Final andSection;483.410(d))<T3>Comment: </T3>Approximately 45 commenters expressed views about theprovision in this section that would require the facility to provide thefollowing services directly through its own staff: the services of a qualifiedmental retardation professional; direct care services; nursing services;development and monitoring of active treatment programs; and living quarters.The majority of the commenters objected to the provision because it wouldrequire the facility to employ staff directly and prohibited them from``arranging for'' staff on an as needed basis. The most frequent objectiondealt with the employment of nursing staff for clients with medical careplans. Many commenters believe it is unreasonable to require a facilityto employ directly a nurse for clients with medical care plans when a clientmay have such a plan infrequently and then, only for a short period oftime. They felt that employment of nurses on a temporary basis, perhapsthrough a home health agency, would be a better alternative.Other objections came from a State which by law requires case managementand assessment to be conducted by county government and not the facility.The proposed requirement for providing active treatment monitoring services``directly'' would seriously conflict with this local law. Another Stateprovides the qualified mental retardation professional function, nursingservices and the development and monitoring of active treatment programsthrough a centralized client services management agency. This arrangementhas allowed for the development and support of small community-based facilitiesthat could not exist without it.Another commenter objected to requiring direct provision of living quartersbecause it precluded the facility from leasing space to provide servicesin small community-based facilities.Response: The basic objective in specifying which services had to be provideddirectly by the facility was to assure that a facility would not createan ICF/MR ``on paper'' and contract out all the essential services, therebyescaping any real responsibility for their quality. The commenters on thisrequirement have pointed out the considerable difficulty this would causefor existing arrangements and for initiatives to establish more communitybased facilities. The commenters also pointed out how this requirementconflicts with our stated objective of providing more flexibility withgreater emphasis on the outcome. As a consequence, we have deleted therequirement for direct provision of these services while retaining therequirements a facility must meet when it arranges to obtain a servicefrom an outside resource. These requirements are: (1) For a written agreementspecifying the conditions under which the services are provided and thatthe facility is responsible for assuring that the outside services meetFederal standards for quality; and (2) that the facility, itself, assurethat the services meet client needs. If a facility fails to meet any ofthese requirements (for example, if the facility fails to assure the qualityof the services provided under an arrangement), it is subject to the samesanctions as if it had provided the services directly.I. Personnel Policies (Proposed andSection; 442.420; Final andSection; 483.420(d))<T3>Comment: </T3>A significant number of commenters raised objectionsabout the proposal to require facilities to develop and implement personnelpolicies. Some insisted that to be meaningful these policies should bein writing. Others wanted personnel policies to be reviewed annually. Anothercommenter wanted to distinguish the term ``job description'' from ``jobclassification''.Response: Because of the significant interpretive problems raised by commenters,because we do not view the availability of job descriptions and writtenpersonnel policies as a significant client care issue, and because writtenjob description and personnel policies are regulated by State law, especiallyfor the small provider, we have withdrawn the proposed requirements atandSection; 442.420(a) for personnel policies and andSection; 442.420(b) forjob descriptions. We note that the remaining provisions of this proposedsection have been moved. The proposed andSection; 442.420(c) dealing withcommunicable disease has been modified as indicated in the following commentand response, and incorporated into the provisions relating to infectioncontrol (andSection; 483.470(1)(4) of this final rule). The proposed andSection;442.420(d) that would prohibit employment of individuals with a historyof child abuse has been incorporated into the provisions relating to stafftreatment of clients at andSection; 483.420(d) of this final rule.<T3>Comment: </T3>Many commenters were concerned about the proposed regulationsthat would prohibit employees with signs and symptoms of communicable diseasefrom working. They were concerned about the definition of the phrase ``communicabledisease'' and suggested the requirement be changed to apply only to thoseemployees who have contact with clients.Response: We agree and have changed the regulations to prohibit employeeswith symptoms or signs of a communicable disease from ``direct contact''with clients and their food (andSection; 483.470(1)(4) of this final rule).<T3>Comment: </T3>Many commenters expressed concern about the problem ofemploying those with a history of child abuse, neglect or exploitation,indicating that a ``history'' of abuse was vague and nonspecific. Severalof these commenters suggested that the proposed requirement be modifiedto prohibit employment by those convicted of child abuse, neglect or exploitation.Response: We agree in part and have modified the requirement to prohibitemployment of individuals who have been ``convicted'' of one of the mentionedabuses. However, we have retained the proposed prohibition against theemployment of individuals with a ``history'' of such abuses but have defined``history'' as ``prior employment history''. We do not believe that itwould be an unreasonable task for the facility to obtain references fromprevious employers to determine if a prior history of child abuse, neglector exploitation exists.J. Licensure and Professional Standards (Proposed andSection; 442.422; Deletedin Final)<T3>Comment: </T3>Seven commenters objected to the provision that wouldrequire the facility to meet the same professional licensure requirementsthat the State has established for comparable positions in the community.Commenters stated that this requirement would have the effect of supersedingState laws that specifically allow less qualified individuals to practicein State institutions (that is, ICFs/MR) than in community facilities.Three of the commenters asked us to amend the regulations so that it wouldnot supersede State law in those States that allow a lower standard inState institutions. One commenter specifically asked that we add the words``unless specifically provided for under State law and regulation''.Two commenters suggested that we clarify the regulations because the proposedandSection; 442.460(e)(5) would allow a masters level psychologist, but theproposed andSection; 442.422 would require a doctoral level if the facilitywas in a State that required the doctoral level degree for community practice.Response: We agree with the commenters who would like to amend this sectionso that these regulations would not supersede State laws that specificallyallow lower personnel requirements in public institutions (that is, ICFs/MR).These laws are usually based on the theory that the setting of larger Stateinstitutions imposes a level of supervision that is not present in independentpractice. To amend this section as commenters wish would be to requirethe facility to meet the personnel credentialling requirements of Statelaw. We have deleted the proposed andSection; 442.422 from the final rulebecause the proposed andSection; 442.416 (andSection; 483.410(b) of this finalrule) that would require the facility to meet applicable State laws meetstheir concerns on this issue.The deletion of andSection; 442.422 answers the concerns that the proposedpersonnel requirements for psychologists at andSection; 442.422 were inconsistentwith the proposed requirements under the standard for professional programservices (andSection; 442.460(e)(5) of the proposed, andSection; 483.430(b)(5)of the final).K. Staff Treatment of Clients (Proposed andSection; 442.424; Final andSection;483.420(d))<T3>Comment: </T3>Many commenters suggested that to be useful the policiesand procedures that prohibit mistreatment, neglect and abuse should bein writing.Response: We agree that policies and procedures on prohibition of mistreatment,neglect and abuse should be in writing and have amended the regulationsaccordingly. Since these policies and procedures are directly related tothe protection of clients' rights, health and safety, we want everyonein a facility to know exactly what policies and procedures exist in thisregard.<T3>Comment: </T3>Many commenters objected to the five day time frame forinvestigations of alleged incidents of mistreatment, neglect or abuse.Some commenters indicated that five days is too short a period to conductan investigation while others said that five days is an excessive amount.Response: The current regulations at andSection; 442.430(c)(2) allow 24 hoursfor this reporting. In the proposed rule, we increased this reporting timeto five working days because we wanted to allow sufficient time for a reasonablythorough investigation. While incidents of this nature will vary widelyin their degree of severity, and thus require a wide variation in timenecessary to investigate them, we believe that five working days is a goodbalance for most cases. Further, we do not preclude the facility from conductingsuch investigations in a shorter period of time. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that the regulations should statethe specific kinds of reporting mechanisms that are acceptable to meetthe proposed requirements for reporting mistreatment, abuse or neglectof clients. Response: We believe that the proposed regulations adequately address thebroad objective the facility much achieve. We do not believe it necessaryto specify detailed reporting mechanisms. We also believe that a facilityshould be free to develop its own specific procedures as long as documentationexists that shows that alleged violations are investigated and appropriateaction taken. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that this section be expandedto prohibit client exploitation as well as mistreatment, neglect and abuse.Response: We do not agree with this suggestion because we believe that``mistreatment'' would include the exploitation of a client. We will explainin interpretive guidelines that mistreatment includes exploitation. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested clarification of the term ``appropriatecorrective action'' as it pertains to the actions of the administratoronce an alleged violation has been verified. Response: We can not attempt to describe all the potential abuses and thedegrees to which they may occur. Thus we cannot attempt to define ``appropriatecorrective action''. The facts of the situation will have to be evaluatedby the surveyor and a judgment made about appropriateness. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters suggested that this section couldbe strengthened by clearly stating that the facility's immediate responsibilityin the event of an allegation of abuse or neglect is to ensure no furtherharm to the client. Response: We agree and have modified the regulations to require the facilityto take steps to prevent any further potential abuse while alleged abusesare being investigated. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters suggested that the facility shouldbe required to investigate abuse or injuries caused by another client,self-abuse, or incidents by an unknown source. Response: We have accepted this comment and, at andSection; 483.420(d)(1)of this final rule, have changed the proposed provisions to require thefacility to prohibit neglect or abuse by any individual. We also have modifiedthe proposed provisions to include a requirement that the facility investigateinjuries of unknown sources regardless of the source. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the report of an investigationinto alleged violations of mistreatment, abuse and neglect should be apreliminary report. Response: We do not agree with this suggestion. We have already extendedthe period in which a report may be prepared from 24 hours to five workingdays. To allow the report to be preliminary would unnecessarily weakenthe requirement. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters suggested that the proposed regulationsbe modified so that ``alleged violations of policies are reported'' ischanged to ``alleged violations of abuse and neglect are reported''. Othercommenters asked that we simply delete the words ``of policies'' so thatthe focus would be on the violation, not on policy. Response: We agree with the commenters that the focus of the requirementis the reporting of mistreatment, abuse and neglect. Therefore, we havechanged the regulations accordingly. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that we define ``working days''as it is used in the proposal requiring a facility to report investigationsof alleged violations of mistreatment, abuse and neglect within five workingdays.Response: We will define this term in intepretive guidelines by statingthat it refers to Monday through Friday excluding State and Federal holidays.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter indicated that there should be a way tobypass the administrator if he or she is the abuser. Response: We agree with this commenter and have modified the regulationsso that the results of an investigation may be reported to the administratoror to ``other officials''. (The interpretive guidelines will expalin thatwhen a report of known or suspected abuse or neglect involves the actsor omissions of the administrator, a different properly constituted authorityoutside of the facility must receive and investigate the report and takeappropriate protective and corrective action.) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter noted that it would be appropriate to incorporateinto this standard the prohibition of verbal, physical and sexual abuseproposed under the standard ``Behavior Management_policies and procedures''at andSection; 442.452(c). Response: We have deleted the reference to verbal, physical or sexual abusefrom the standard concerning behavior management and will explain in interpretiveguidelines that the prohibition of these forms of abuse are encompassedunder the standard concerning staff treatment of clients. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that this section also should mandatethat facilities have an appropriate procedure to deal with situations whenclients are missing. Response: We agree with this commenter. However, provision already wasmade for addressing the issue of missing clients under the proposed andSection;442.550 that concerns emergency plans and procedures and that would requirethe facility to develop and implement written plans and procedures to dealwith missing clients. This provision has been incorporated into the finalrule at andSection; 483.470(h). <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed concern that measures be takento protect the rights of employees as well as clients. Response: While it is true that employee rights are a significant issuein allegations of client abuse, these regulations are designed to protectand treat clients of the facility. We expect State and local law, employmentcontracts, and union contracts to address issues of employee protections.L. Facility Staffing (Proposed andSection; 442.426; Final andSection; 483.430(c))<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed an opinion on the proposed requirementat andSection; 442.426(a) that the facility must not depend upon clientsor volunteers to perform direct care services for the facility. In theirview, the phrase ``must not depend'' is unclear. They asked whether thismeans that clients or volunteers cannot perform client care services andwhether this would eliminate forster grandparents. Response: The intent of the regulations is that the facility may not entirelyrely upon volunteers for routine staffing. The interpretive guidelinesfor these regulations will explain that volunteers may provide supplementaryservices but that the facility may not rely exclusively upon them to performdirect care services. Facilities cannot depend on volunteers to fill requiredstaff positions. <T3>Comment: </T3>There are fifteen comments on andSection; 442.426 (b) and(e) of the proposed regulations. The intent of both these sections is thatdirect care staff are not required to perform support services to the extentthat these duties interfere with the exercise of their primary direct clientcare duties. Most of the commenters felt that the wording in the proposedparagraph (b) (which states that direct care staff must not be requiredto provide housekeeping, laundry or other support services to the extentthat these duties interfere with the exercise of their primary direct clientcare duties) precluded any flexibility in management. In their view, thereare, at times, legitimate reasons for direct care staff to perform suchduties. For example, at times, staff in group homes do housework whiletraining residents. The commenters preferred the wording in the proposedparagraph (e) that states, ``The facility must provide sufficient supportstaff so that direct care staff are not required to perform support servicesto the extent that these duties interfere with the exercise of their primarydirect client care duties. Response: We have accepted the comments, recognizing that the proposedparagraphs (b) and (e) of andSection; 442.426 are duplicative. Since thecommenters preferred the wording of paragraph (e), we have deleted theproposed paragraph (b) and retained the language of the proposed paragraph(e). <T3>Comment: </T3>There were seventeen commenters on the proposed requirementat andSection; 442.426(c) that in each residential living unit housing clientsfor whom a physician has ordered a medical care plan, or clients who areaggressive, assaultive or security risks, or one that houses more than16 persons, there must be responsible direct care staff on duty and awakewhen clients are present to take prompt, appropriate action in case ofinjury, illness, fire or other emergency. Many of the commenters felt thatthe term medical care plan was unclear and needed to be defined. Severalcommenters also questioned whether or not the proposed requirement meantthat there must be responsible direct care staff on duty and awake whenclients are present in group homes with live-in houseparents. Response: We have accepted the comments requesting clarification of theterm ``medical care plan''. This also was a significant issue in the commentson the proposed andSection; 442.464, Physician Participation (see SectionIII.AA. of this preamble). Thus, we have clarified under andSection; 483.460(a)concerning physician services that a physician must develop, in coordinationwith licensed nursing personnel, a medical care plan of treatment for aclient whose health needs are so severe as to require 24-hour licensednursing supervision. With regard to group homes with live-in houseparents,the proposed regulations would require and the final regulations requireresponsible direct care staff on duty and awake when clients are presentin each of the situations stated in the proposed regulation; that is, whenthe residential building houses more than 16 clients or when the residentialliving unit houses clients for whom a physician has ordered a medical careplan, or clients who are aggressive, assaultive or security risks. In thesesituations, clients are high risk individuals in terms of their vulnerabilityto emergency situations such as fires, injuries or health emergencies (forexample, aspiration, cardiac or respiratory failure, seizures). Such vulnerabilityalso increases as the number of clients in a facility increase. Thus, inthese situations, a responsible direct care staff person on duty and awakehas been retained as a requirement. <T3>Comment: </T3>There were five comments on the proposed requirementat andSection;442.426(d) that in each defined residential living unit housingclients for whom a physician has not ordered a medical care plan and thathouses 16 or fewer clients, there must be a responsible direct care staffperson immediately accessible to clients on a 24-hour basis. The majorityof the commenters felt that the term ``immediately accessible'' shouldbe defined. One commenter felt that the regulation should read, ``theremust be a responsible direct care staff person on the premises and immediatelyaccessible''. Response: We have revised the regulations to read that staff must be ``onduty'' rather than immediately accessible. Interpretive guidelines willexplain that the intent of the regulation is that at all times a staffperson is in a position to help if client need arises. We will explainthat on-duty staff, for purposes of this provision, need not be awake.We also will explain that the provision (located in the final rule at andSection;483.430(c)(2))has been modified to assure that 16 or fewer clients located in units ofmulti-unit buildings must have staff on duty and ``awake''. This provisionis necessary because multi-unit buildings are usually of such size andconfiguration that the opportunity for staff to detect and react to clientproblems is excessively limited. <T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters felt that the term ``support staff'' was unclearin the proposal at andSection;442.426(e) that would require the facilityto provide sufficient support staff so that direct care staff are not requiredto perform support services to the extent that those duties interfere withthe exercise of their primary direct client care duties. Response: We have accepted these comments and will include the followingdefinitions in the interpretive guidelines for the regulation: Supportstaff include all personnel hired by the facility that are not either directcare staff or professional staff. For example, support staff include, butare not limited to, housekeepers, maintenance and laundry personnel. Directcare staff are those personnel managing and supervising the daily needsof clients in their living quarters. <T3>Comment: </T3>Thirty-one comments were received on the proposed requirementat andSection;442.426(f) that the facility must employ a qualified dietitian,who is registered or eligible for registration by the American DieteticAssociation, either on a full-time, part-time or on a consultant basis.The majority of the comments suggested that the regulation should be morespecific with regard to the number of hours a qualified dietitian shouldbe employed by the facility. Most of the commenters felt that the numberof hours should depend on facility size. There was no consensus among thecommenters, however, as to how specific guidelines could relate facilitysize to the number of hours needed from a qualified dietitian. Severalcommenters felt that the regulations should allow more flexibility by statingthat the facility should employ a qualified dietitian for sufficient timeto meet the needs of residents. Some of the commenters also believed thatthe requirements regarding dietitian personnel in the proposed andSection;442.426(f) and (g) should be moved to the proposed standard at andSection;442.558,concerning food and nutrition services. Response: We have accepted the comments suggesting that the regulationsbe flexible enough to allow facilities to employ a qualified dietitianfor sufficient time to meet the needs of residents. We also have acceptedthe comments suggesting that facility requirements for employing a dietitianshould be moved from the standard concerning facility staffing to the standardconcerning food and nutrition services. Additionally, to ensure that allprofessional qualifications are consolidated, we have moved the qualificationsfor a professional dietitian to the professional program services standard.Thus, in this final rule, the standard for food and nutrition servicesat andSection;483.480(a)(2) will state that ``A qualified dietitian mustbe employed either full-time, part-time, or on a consultant basis at thefacility's discretion.'' <T3>Comment: </T3>Twenty-one comments were received concerning the proposedrequirement that if a qualified dietitian is not employed full-time, thefacility must designate a person to serve as the director of food services.Many of the commenters felt that qualifications for a non-dietitian foodservice director need to be added. Additionally, several commenters believedthat the regulations should be expanded to specify the duties of the foodservice supervisor. Response: We have not accepted the comments requesting that the qualificationsand duties of the designated director of food services who is not a qualifieddietitian be added to the regulations. The outcomes of good food and nutritionservices were outlined under the proposed standards at andSection;442.460Meal Services, andSection;442.562 Menus, and andSection;442.564 Dining Areasand Service, and have been adopted into this final rule under the conditionof participation concerning dietetic services at andSection;483.480. An exampleof an outcome is nutritional foods served in appropriate quantities andat appropriate temperatures. The intent of the regulations is that thespecified outcomes be met. If the outcomes are achieved, the qualificationsand duties of the person performing the services do not need to be specifiedin regulations. M. Direct Care Staff (Proposed andSection;442.428; Final andSection;483.430(d))<T3>Comment: </T3>Approximately 60 commenters expressed views on the proposalto prescribe various staff to client ratios depending on the needs of theclients (for example, one staff member to 3.2 clients with severe disabilities;one staff member to four clients with moderate disabilities; and one staffmember to six clients with mild disabilities). In essence, the commenters had two clear reactions to the proposal: (1)They uniformly thought that the ratios were inadequate to provide activetreatment and barely adequate to provide custodial care, and many commentersthought that we needed a requirement for ``sufficient'' direct care staffto supplement the ratios as they were proposed; and (2) the commentersthought the ratios needed clarification. Commenters asked for clarificationof the following: what staff are included in calculating the ratios; wasit permissible to have part-time staff serve when the number of clientsdictated less than a full-time staff; and, are staff necessary when thereare no clients in the living unit such as when all clients are at workshopsor school. Finally, commenters expressed a preference for ratios basedon shifts, as described in the preamble to the proposed rule, rather thanon a 24-hour basis as proposed in the regulations text. Response: We have retained the ratios as proposed, which would requirestaffing levels comparable to those in existing regulations at andSection;442.445(c),but in accordance with public comments, we have made the following changesin order to strengthen and clarify the regulations. 1. We have decided to retain the proposed ratios, which are based on a24-hour time frame, in order to provide the facility as much flexibilityin staffing as possible. 2. We have added a requirement that the facility provide ``sufficient directcare staff to manage and supervise clients in accordance with the individualprogram plans''. This standard clearly establishes ``sufficient staff''as the optimal requirement and subsumes the ratios as the minimal standard.We believe the addition of the ``sufficient direct care staff'' provisionis an effective means of addressing the commenters' opinions that the statedratios are inadequate, since the new provision is tied to implementationof client objectives and therefore assessable in an outcome oriented surveyprocess. 3. We will define in interpretive guidelines that direct care staff arethose staff who manage, supervise and provide direct care to clients intheir residential living units. This staff could include professional staff(for example, registered nurses, social workers) or other support staffif their primary assigned, daily shift function is to provide management,supervision and direct care of clients' daily needs (for example, bathing,dressing, feeding, toileting, recreation, and support and reinforcementof active treatment objectives) in their living units. However, professionalstaff who simply work with clients in a living unit on a periodic basiscannot be included. Also, supervisors of client care staff can be countedonly if they share in the actual work of the direct care of clients. Supervisorswhose principal assigned function is to supervise other staff cannot beincluded. 4. We have added a provision that stipulates that when no client is presentin the living unit, no staff need to be present. This will satisfy commenterswho objected to staffing a facility when all the clients were away at workshopsor school. However, we have included a requirement for a responsible staffperson to be available by telephone in case one of the clients needs toreturn to the living unit (andSection;483.430(d)(4)). 5. We will make it clear in interpretive guidelines that when only oneclient is in a living unit, there must be at least one staff person on-duty.As did the proposed regulations, the final regulations require a minimumof one staff person to be on duty when clients are present in a facilityhousing 16 or fewer clients (andSection;483.430(c)(3)), and a minimum ofone staff person to be on-duty and awake when clients are present in afacility housing more than 16 clients (andSection;483.430(c)(2)). N. Staff Training Program (Proposed andSection;442.430; Final andSection;483.430(e))<T3>Comment: </T3>Many commenters expressed support for the proposed changesregarding staff training since we emphasized performance rather than meetingpaper requirements. However, other commenters indicated that the proposedstandard was too general and that a greater degree of specificity was neededindicating the kinds of training required, the number of hours requiredfor training, documentation of inservice curricula, etc. Response: We believe that the proposed standard would allow a degree offlexibility to a staff training program that would be lost by establishingspecific criteria. The training needs of facilities vary from facilityto facility, with such factors of facility size and staff experience beingimportant elements in determining training needs. We believe that specificcriteria would be counterproductive to the intent of the standard. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters expressed concern about the requirementin the proposed andSection;442.430(c) that states that staff must be ableto demonstrate the skills and techniques needed in client care. Concernwas focused on the means of establishing that the requisite skills havebeen learned. It was suggested that interpretive guidelines be issued thatwould define more clearly the expectations of achieving this requirement.Response: We believe the standard is clearly stated. Essentially, staffmust know how to do what the facility has committed itself to do in behalfof each client's active treatment objective. This is the essence of anoutcome oriented requirement. If staff do not know how to do their jobs,clients cannot achieve stated objectives in their plans. We will assessin surveys whether staff can show us how to implement active treatmentprograms and to treat clients. Although not in response to a particular comment, we have made one clarifyingchange to the standard. We have changed the provision of the proposed andSection;442.430(c)from, ``Staff must be able to demonstrate skills and techniques necessaryto implement the individual program plans for each client under their care,''to ``each client for whom they are responsible''. O. Client Records (Proposed andSection;442.432; Final andSection;483.410(c))<T3>Comment: </T3>There were several comments on the proposed regulationat andSection;442.432(a) that would require the facility to develop and maintaina recordkeeping system. Most of the commenters suggested that the currentregulations found at andSection;442.501(b) requiring specific client dataand andSection;442.501(c) requiring a discharge summary be added. Response: Necessary elements of the current regulations at andSection;442.501(b) and (c) were included in the proposed regulations. The requirementfor specific client data was included at the proposed andSection;442.448(a)(andSection;483.440(e)(1) of this final rule); the requirement for a dischargesummary was included at the proposed andSection;442.442(c)(4) (andSection;483.440(b)(5)(ii)of this final rule); relevant health-related information was included atthe proposed andSection;442.448(b) (andSection;483.420(c)(1) of the final rule);relevant restraint information was included at the proposed andSection;442.456(c), (e) and (h) (andSection;483.420(c)(2) and andSection;483.450 (c)(4) and(d)(2), (4) and (6) of the final rule); relevant behavioral and family-relatedinformation was included at the proposed andSection;442.448(a) (andSection;483.440(e)(1) and (2) of the final rule); and relevant social and legal informationwas included at the proposed andSection;442.432 (a) and (c) (andSection;483.420(c)(1) and (3) of the final rule). <T3>Comment: </T3>There were 11 commenters on the proposed regulationsat andSection;442.432 (b) and (c) that deal with the confidentiality andrelease of information in clients' records. All of the commenters believedthat the regulations should specify that confidentiality and release ofinformation does not apply to government agencies and advocacy groups.Response: We agree with the thrust of the commenters suggestions that governmentagencies and advocacy groups be allowed to review client records when appropriatelytrying to evaluate the information that such records contain. However,we have not revised the regulations. To state in the regulations that advocacygroups have access to information without receiving the necessary consentfrom a client or his or her parents or legal guardian violates the rightsof the client. <T3>Comment: </T3>There were three comments on the proposed requirementat andSection;442.432(d) that any individual who makes an entry in a client'srecord must make it legibly, date it, and sign it. All of the commentersbelieved that the requirement that each record be signed is obsolete inthe days of automated data systems. Response: We have not accepted these comments. Even though computerizationis routine in many areas of client records, the purpose of any routinizationof information that is involved is to save the time of professionals. Thesignature on the client's record however, indicates that the informationin the record has been individualized and the professionals take responsibilityfor the information it contains. However, interpretive guidelines willpermit the use of electronic signatures in cases in which the facilityhas created the option for medical records to be maintained by computerrather than in hard copy. <T3>Comment: </T3>There were five comments on the proposed requirementat andSection;442.432(f) that the facility must provide each identified residentialliving unit with appropriate aspects of each client's record. All of thecommenters believed that the regulation was too vague and that the terms``appropriate aspects'' should be clarified. Response: We will define the term ``appropriate aspects'' in interpretiveguidelines as meaning the active treatment, social as well as health aspectsof the plan.P. Emergencies or Death of a Client (Proposed andSection; 442.434; FinalandSection; 483.420(c)(6))<T3>Comment: </T3>There were eleven comments on the proposal to requirefacilities to notify promptly the client's parent or guardian of any significantincidents including serious illness, accident or death, and autopsy findingsif requested. Many of the commenters felt that examples of significantincidents, in addition to serious illness, accident or death, should beincluded. Some of their suggestions were unauthorized absence from thefacility and allegations of abuse. An additional group of commenters thoughtthat autopsy findings should not be included because many facilities donot do autopsies or receive autopsy reports.Response: In this final rule, we have included abuse and unauthorized absencesas examples of significant incidents. Also, we will issue interpretiveguidelines that will state other examples, including those the commenterssuggested.We note that we have moved this standard into the standard concerning communicationswith clients, parents, and guardians. Thus, in the final regulations, itis located at andSection; 483.420(c)(6). Additionally, we have accepted thecomments requesting that autopsy findings be removed from the regulations.Q. Infection Control (Proposed andSection; 442.436; Final andSection; 483.470(l))<T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters recommended that we define in the regulationthe term ``active program'' as it was used in the proposed provision torequire an active program for the prevention, control, and investigationof infection and communicable diseases.Response: We have not accepted these comments to include this level ofspecificity in the regulations. However, interpretive guidelines will definean active program as one that includes the direct care staff routinelywashing their hands after working with a client who has an infectious disease,the continuous use of aspectic technique when appropriate, an on-goingprogram of communicable disease control and investigation of infections.<T3>Comment: </T3>Five commenters expressed an opinion on the proposalto require facilities to maintain a log of incidents and corrective actionsrelated to infections. Several of the commenters believed that the maintenanceof a log could be burdensome and would be of no use to the facility. Additionally,some commenters felt that the term ``record'' should replace the term ``log''.Response: We have changed the word ``log'' to ``record''. However, we havenot removed the requirement to maintain such records. Without such records,public health officials have no evidence with which to conduct epidemiologicalinvestigations. Such investigations are necessary to establish the causationupon which corrective action must be based.R. Active Treatment (Proposed andSection;andSection; 435.1009 and 442.440;final andSection;andSection; 435.1009 and 483.440(a))<T3>Comment: </T3>Forty-three commenters submitted their opinions aboutthe proposed definition of active treatment provided at andSection;andSection;442.440 and 435.1009. In general, commenters expressed clear support forthe concept underlying the proposed defintion. Twenty-one commenters expressedspecific support that active treatment explicitly include those servicesintended to prevent client regression. However, commenters stated thatin their opinion, the language of the proposed definition was still unclear.Objections expressed by the majority of commenters focused on four issues:(1) The definition of active treatment included the term ``active treatment'',thus active treatment was defined as being an ``active treatment program'';(2) the difference in meaning of the terms ``behavioral'', ``developmental''and ``social'' skills, as used in the definition, was insignificant, andtechnically imprecise; (3) services intended to ``decelerate'' the rateof regression of clients who have degenerative conditions (for exampleMuscular dystrophy, or Alzheimer's disease) were not included as ``activetreatment''; and (4) the phrase, ``For dependent clients where no furtherpositive growth is demonstrable'', as used in the proposed definition,was perceived to be stigmatizing, did not identify criteria useful in makingsuch determinations, and authorized a facility unintentionally, to provide``custodial care'' if client potential for growth was uncertain, or noteasily measurable. Commenters submitted suggested revisions to the proposedlanguage to be considered for inclusion.Response: We found the comments pertaining to active treatment to be helpful,and agree that the proposed definition (at andSection; 435.1009) and requirements(at andSection; 442.440) could be strengthen with some of the modificationssuggested. Therefore, we have made several revisions. First, in andSection;435.1009, of this final rule we stated that active treatment is treatmentthat meets the requirements specified in the standard concerning activetreatment at andSection; 483.440(a). Second, we have revised the regulationsto include at andSection; 483.440 a condition of participation entitled ``Activetreatment services''. The standard at andSection; 483.440(a) now specifiesthat active treatment is the aggressive, consistent implementation of aprogram of specialized and generic training, treatment, health and relatedservices, as described in 42 CFR Part 483, Subpart D. Third, since theuse of the terms ``behavioral'', ``developmental'', and ``social'' to modifythe word ``skills'' was technically imprecise, we have revised the standardconcerning active treatment to require that each client's program mustbe directed toward the acquisition of the behaviors necessary for the clientto function with as much self-determination and independence as possible.Fourth, although the proposal had been intended to include services todecelerate the regression of clients with degenerative conditions, we haverevised the regulations (now at andSection; 483.440(a)(1)(ii)) to includethis statement as an explicit requirement. Lastly, we have deleted thequalifier phrase, ``For dependent clients where no further positive growthis reasonably considered possible'', since the language of the regulation,``active treatment includes services to prevent or decelerate regressionor loss of current optimal status'' embodies our original intent.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter criticized the proposed definition of activetreatment because it did not mandate that clients be placed in the ``leastrestrictive alternative'' available. This commenter stated that, for thedefinition of active treatment to be consistent with accepted standardsin the field of mental retardation and developmental disabilities, it shouldinclude this requirement at andSection;andSection; 435.1009(a)(1) and 442.440(a)(1).Response: We appreciate the suggestion of the commenter, and agree thatplacing clients in the ``least restrictive alternative'' available is animportant principle in the field of mental retardation and developmentaldisabilities. It is our belief, however, that requiring this as a partof the active treatment program, and thus making it a requirement for FFP,would go beyond the statutory intent of Congress in authorizing ICF/MRservices. There is nothing in the statutory language at 1905(d) of theAct, which authorizes ICF/MR services, that suggests that the size or thelocation of a facility, or whether a facility is the least restrictivealternative, should determine whether or not a facility qualifies for FFP.The only statutory requirement is that a client receive active treatmentat the facility. Therefore, we have not accepted this suggestion for change.However, we have revised these regulations to include the application ofthis concept to other provisions, especially with regard to impositionof restrictive or intrusive techniques to change client behavior as discussedin andSection; 483.450(b)(1)(iii) of this final rule.<T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters criticized the proposed definition,because in their opinion it implies that only ``some'' clients can benefitfrom active treatment. These commenters stated that all individuals canbenefit from active treatment, since it means training or education.Response: We agree that the term ``active treatment'' is defined by manyprofessionals in the field of mental retardation and developmental disabilities,to mean habilitation, education and training services. Also, active treatmentis often considered to be synonymous with life-long learning. However,the purpose of the proposed definition of active treatment was not to includeall the meanings that may be given to the term, but to provide a definitionof active treatment that specifically encompasses those services that clientsmust require and receive, in order to be certified as needing ICF/MR careunder the Medicaid benefit. We believe the definition of active treatmentincluded in the final rule achieves that purpose. Nevertheless, we recognizethat there are other definitions of active treatment. As we noted, we haveset forth a definition of active treatment in the final rule at andSection;435.1009 that cross-refers the reader to the standard for active treatmentat andSection; 483.440(a).<T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters criticized the proposed definition ofactive treatment because in their opinion it did not identify the specific``outcomes'' toward which active treatment is to be directed. Other commenterssuggested that we amend the definition to require that clients must notonly receive active treatment, but that they also must benefit from activetreatment, as well.Response: We agree that active treatment should be outcome oriented. But,we do not agree that we should include this additional requirement. Webelieve the state-of-the-art is such that we can hold providers accountableto implement, review and continually modify the strategies they use toimpove client functional abilities. However, we recognize that there arelegitimate reasons why a client may not gain a desired objective. Thus,active treatment is measured more in terms of how aggressively, competentlyand consistently the ICF/MR pursues objectives in behalf of clients.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters stated that the provision of habilitationservices is the cornerstone of active treatment. Therefore, they recommendedspecifically that the proposed definition be amended to include the term``habilitation'', as it is used in the context of the Home and Community-BasedServices Waiver program (as provided in section 1915(c)(5) of the Act,that was added by section 9502(a) of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget ReconciliationAct of 1985 (COBRA), Public Law 99-272).Response: We do not agree that the term habilitation, as defined for purposesof the home and community-based waiver program, should be included in thedefinition of active treatment at andSection;435.1009. Although Congressprovided a definition of habilitation services in section 1915(c)(5) ofthe Act, that definition focuses on clients who otherwise would have beeninstitutionalized rather than strictly those currently in an ICF/MR. Byits own terms, it refers to ``individuals who receive such services afterdischarge from a skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility,''and not to inpatients. While active treatment may include some servicesthat are defined as being habilitative, we do not believe that it is feasibleto attempt to identify in our definition of active treatment every typeof service that must be provided to ICF/MR residents to assist them toreach maximum possible independence. Nevertheless, we believe our definitionof active treatment is sufficient in scope to encompass the whole rangeof services necessary for clients to achieve maximum possible independence.<T3>Comment: </T3>Conversely, other commenters objected to the proposeddefinition of active treatment, because in their opinion it meant thatactive treatment was limited only to habilitation services. Twenty-twocommenters suggested that the definition of active treatment also shouldinclude vocational, educational, rehabilitational, medical, behavioral,social, and personal care services; and any other services necessary tomeet the client's needs as identified by the comprehensive functional assessment.These commenters recommended that clients should be provided with any ofthese services that are needed to help them achieve a developmental goalrelated to their individual program plans (IPPs).Response: Such services may be among those embraced by some within theterm ``active treatment''. However, as stated before, we do not agree withthe commenters that we should attempt to identify specifically in the regulationsall the various services that can be considered to be active treatment.We do not believe that this would be feasible because there are many contingenciesthat may effect whether or not a specific service constitutes active treatmentfor a particular client. However, we believe the definition of and standardfor active treatment in this final rule does encompass the whole rangeof services necessary for the client to achieve as much individual independenceas possible.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters recommended that we identify withinthe definition of active treatment, those active treatment services thatare reimbursable by Medicaid. These commenters stated that the regulationsshould provide a clear distinction between those services for which FFPis available, and those vocational and educational services that are notcovered by Medicaid. Also, commenters believed that interested groups andcitizens should be given the opportunity to offer comments and suggestionson how these distinctions would be made. Although HCFA has used guidelinesfor this purpose, the commenters asserted that regulations are preferable.Response: We disagree. First, the source of payment for services a facilityprovides does not govern the requirements relating to the provision ofservices. Thus, all ``active treatment'' services, although necessary asa condition of participation, may not be reimbursable as medical assistanceor rehabilitative services under Medicaid. A facility must meet the requirementsof these regulations to participate in the Medicaid program regardlessof the payment status of individual services. Also, the distinction betweenpayors is often as much a function of Federal and State education and vocationaltraining laws as it is related to the nature of the services themselves.Thus substantive distinctions between types of services are not withinthe purview of this regulation. Regulations addressing the exclusion ofFFP for vocational training and educational activities in ICFs/MR alreadyare contained at andSection;441.13(b).With respect to the commenters' concern about HCFA guidelines used to interpretandSection;441.13(b), we note that the State Medicaid Manual (SMM) is theofficial medium by which HCFA interprets or clarifies issues and sets forthprocedures that States are required to follow in implementing the regulations.Guidelines that are issued as part of the SMM are official interpretationsof the law and regulations. Thus, these guidelines are not a substitutefor the regulations, but a guide to States on compliance with the requirementsin the regulations.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters stated that we should revise the requirementsfor active treatment to encompass directly all of the services describedin andSection;andSection;442.442 through 442.460 of the proposed regulations,since these sections more clearly describe the whole active treatment processthan our proposed definition does.Response: We agree in part with the commenter. In restructuring the regulationsin the condition format, we have established a condition of participationconcerning active treatment services (andSection;483.440). Under that condition,we have included as standards (a) through (f) the standards that we hadproposed as andSection;andSection;442.440 through 442.450:<ITAG tagnum="16">(a) Standard: Active treatment (proposed as andSection;442.440).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">(b) Standard: Admissions, transfers and discharges (proposed as andSection;442.442).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">(c) Standard: Individual program plan (proposed as andSection;442.444).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">(d) Standard: Program implementation (proposed as andSection;442.446).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">(e) Standard: Program documentation (proposed as andSection;442.448).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">(f) Standard: Program monitoring and change (proposed as andSection;442.450(b), (c), (d), and (e).</ITAG>We have not included the proposed standards at andSection;andSection;442.452through 442.460 under the condition of participation concerning activetreatment. We believe that the proposed standards at andSection;andSection;442.452through 442.458 are grouped more appropriately under the condition concerningclient behavior and facility practices (andSection;483.450 of this finalrule), and the proposed standard at andSection;442.460 concerning professionalprogram services is placed more appropriately under the condition for facilitystaffing (andSection;483.430 of this final rule).<T3>Comment: </T3>Some commenters requested that we clarify the meaningof the proposed rule at andSection;andSection;442.440(b) and 435.1009(b) thatstate that ``Active treatment does not include maintenance of generallyindependent clients who are able to function with little supervision orwho require few if any of the significant active treatment services describedin 42 CFR Part 442.'' Commenters suggested that either we define what wemean by the phrases ``generally independent clients'', ``significant activetreatment services'', ``little supervision'', and ``few if any''; substituteother terms; or specify the amount and intensity of services necessaryto qualify a client as being eligible for ICF/MR level of care.Response: A determination that a particular client does not need activetreatment, because he or she is sufficiently independent, is a decisionthat has to be made on an individual basis. Therefore, to allow room forprofessional judgment on the part of surveyors and providers, and becauseof the limitations of the current state-of-the-art, we believe it is necessaryto describe the requirement in general terms. However, for purposes ofclarity, we have revised the proposed rule, so that the regulations nowdescribe these clients as being ``able to function with little supervisionor in the absence of a continuous active treatment program''. We will issueinterpretive guidelines that will describe the characteristics of clientswho should be reviewed closely by surveyors for inappropriate placementin an ICF/MR setting. Generally, inappropriately placed clients are thoseclients who can become increasingly more independent without aggressiveand consistent training. These clients are usually able to apply skillslearned in training situations to other settings and environments. Theseclients would generally be able to take care of most of their personalcare needs, to make known to others their basic needs and wants, and tounderstand simple commands. They generally would be capable of workingat a productive wage level, and, to some extent, would be able to engageappropriately in social interactions. Also, usually they would be ableto conduct themselves appropriately when allowed to have time away fromthe facilities' premises. Facilities serving these types of clients, whoare by definition inappropriately placed, will be carefully evaluated forinappropriate certification as an ICF/MR.<T3>Comment: </T3>Ten commenters objected to the active treatment programdescribed in the proposed andSection;442.440(d), because it did not includethe maintenance of generally independent clients. Commenters objected tothis exclusion because they believe that without the programmatic structureprovided in an ICF/MR, some of these clients would not be able to continueto function independently and would regress rapidly.Response: We believe that some clients need the help of an ICF/MR to continueto function independently because they have learned to depend upon theprogrammatic structure it provides. We believe these clients should betrained to overcome this learned ``dependency'' through a carefully designedactive treatment program aimed at its elimination. Active treatment forsuch a client should be directed toward the client acquiring skills thatare self-initiated and increasingly more self-directed. It should not includethe ``maintenance programming'' of skills already developed or providingthe client with mere protective oversight. Therefore, we do not agree thatthe prohibition against ``maintenance programming'' should be deleted.On the other hand, we also believe that the commenters may be misinterpretingour intentions. If ``independence'' may only be maintained by means ofconstant interventions by ICF/MR staff through a program of active treatment,then under the terms of this regulation, the client is not independent.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter inquired whether planned activities thatallow a client to use a newly acquired skill for the purpose of maintainingthe client's skill level, could be considered to be active treatment. Thecommenter suggested that to enhance and support a client's progress, activetreatment should include maintaining the client's use of a newly acquiredskill for a period of time in order to maximize independence as much aspossible.Response: We agree that in addition to helping a client acquire a new skill,a training program must also include a period of time during which theclient has the opportunity to demonstrate that the new skill has been acquired.Assisting a client in using and improving an acquired skill is part ofproviding active treatment on a continuous basis, as required by andSection;483.440(d)(1), which is the standard relating to program implementation.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed concern about the proposed definitionof active treatment because it includes services to prevent regression.The commenter believes that this will inappropriately allow facilitiesto provide, as active treatment, services to clients who function at the``brain stem'' level, or whose care is geared primarily towards preventionof physical regression.Response: We disagree. It would not be acceptable to establish an activetreatment program in such a way as to preclude services from being providedto certain individuals because they have certain diagnostic labels. Moreover,current knowledge is not sufficiently advanced to allow us to precludeautomatically clients with certain diagnoses from receiving active treatmentbecause they have very severe physical or medical disabling conditionsthat limit their ability to understand, perceive, or to respond to theirsurroundings.<T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters did not understand how the proposedrule could allow FFP for services to ``prevent regression'', and yet denyFFP for services to ``maintain generally independent clients''. Commentersrequested us to explain this apparent inconsistency.Response: These regulations describe the types of services that constituteactive treatment programs that an ICF/MR must furnish. Thus, it establishesthe bases for determinations of whether or not a facility can be certifiedas an ICF/MF and qualify for FFP. The purpose of active treatment is tobuild continuously on skills already acquired and to teach new skills thatwill assist the client to function at higher levels of independence. Thisrequires an active process of intervention. Since maintenance servicesessentially constitute a passive process, we proposed to exclude from thestandard for active treatment those maintenance services which are forthe purpose of providing generally independent clients with mere protectiveoversight (see andSection; 442.440(b) of the proposal). As the presence ofmere maintenance services increases and goal-directed learning for clientsdecreases, the overall nature of the facility shifts from an ICF/MR toa custodial care facility. Therefore, to be consistent with statutory intent,those facilities predominantly providing the services that we considerto be maintenance services and that are described at andSection; 483.440(a)(2)of this final rule will not be considered to be providing active treatmentand will not qualify, therefore, as an ICF/MR.In recognition of the potential impact severe physical or medical disabilitiescan have on a client's ability to learn new skills, we proposed at andSection;442.440(a)(2) (andSection; 483.440(a)(1)(ii) in the final rule) to includethose active interventions necessary to prevent or decelerate regressionin the requirements for active treatment. An example of this is the applicationof specific stimulation techniques to the area of the mouth of a clientwith severe physical and medical disabilities. If this active interventionhelps the client retain the ability to take food by mouth and deceleratesthe client's rate of reliance on tube feedings, then we will consider thisa component of the active treatment program as described under these regulations.<T3>Comment: </T3>Eleven commenters requested that we publish, in a timelymanner, interpretive guidelines to explain how these regulations will beimplemented. Also, they requested that we give greater emphasis to trainingboth providers, and State and Federal surveyors. These commenters, althoughthey supported the intent of the proposed rule, expressed concern thatunless we provided needed training on the regulations, an acceptable balancewould not be achieved between holding providers accountable for the program,and at the same time, allowing them the flexibility afforded by the newrule.Response: We agree that training on the new regulations is essential forsurveyors, and this is planned. Surveyors will need more detailed instructionsconcerning the meaning of the new rules and how they affect the surveyprocess. Also, we plan to issue interpretive guidelines and surveyor procedurespertaining to these regulations.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter objected to the proposed definition ofactive treatment because it did not include the terms ``prognosis'' or``professionally developed and supervised activities, experiences, or therapies''.These terms are a part of the definition of active treatment that is usedin the current rule at andSection; 435.1009. The commenter stated that theuse of these terms in the definition of active treatment would ensure thatthe development of active treatment programs would be based on state-of-the-artinput, and would make clearer that professional staff are expected to participatein the treatment of clients.Response: We did not use the term ``prognosis'' in the new standard foractive treatment (at andSection; 483.440(a)), because it is directly relatedto the medical model. We wanted to emphasize the developmental model andthe importance of stressing client outcomes.The phrase ``professionally developed and supervised activities, experiences,or therapies'' was not used verbatim in the new rule. However, the samerequirement, in different language, is contained within the standards ofthis final rule relating to active treatment (andSection; 483.440(a)), individualprogram plans (andSection; 483.440(c)), program implementation (andSection;483.440(d)), program and monitoring and change (andSection; 483.440(f)),and physician services (andSection; 483.460(a)).<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked for clarification concerning whatwas expected of a facility, in terms of the resources it would have toexpend, in meeting the proposed requirement to assist clients in reachingtheir ``maximum possible independence''. The commenter wished to know ifthere was a limit on the amount of resources that a facility would haveto expend in assisting a client to reach his or her maximum potential.Response: A facility must meet all the requirements of the regulations.If a facility admits a particular client, it makes a commitment to meetthat client's needs as determined by that client's assessment and IPP.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked whether the certification surveythat is conducted for an ICF/MR, also would include an evaluation of theprograms provided to clients during the day if the programs were obtainedby the facility from another agency. The commenter suggested that it wouldbe fairer to the ICFs/MR if the day programs that they obtain from otheragencies, are certified separately.Response: We disagree. A facility is afforded flexibility by the regulationsin determining the sources it will use to provide active treatment. Itcan provide services directly or obtain them from other qualified resourcesthat are available in the community. If the facility obtains services froman outside source, the regulations require that it ensure that these servicesare effective and consistent with the client's overall plan. Therefore,services provided by outside sources must be coordinated by the ICF/MRto ensure that they are supportive of and consistent with services providedin the facility. Thus, the facility, as the discrete unit to be certified,will be held responsible for ensuring that all the services provided toits clients, including services such as day programs, provided by outsidesources, meet the conditions specified in these regulations.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter could not determine, from the proposeddefinition of active treatment, whether services, not included in the IPP,but which are needed to treat unforeseen or emergency health problems orbehavioral disorders that interrupt or alter the IPP, could be consideredto be active treatment.Response: If an emergency occurs that affects the client's behavior ormedical condition and a client's usual active treatment program cannotbe implemented, the services that a facility must provide to address thatemergency could be considered to be active treatment.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter inquired how compliance with the proposedactive treatment definition would be assessed in the following situations:(1) Clients are so severely disabled that they ``seem'' to be relativelyinactive in their treatment; (2) clients are too active, and initiate toomuch in their treatment; or (3) clients participate actively in unacceptableday programs. This commenter expressed concern that the proposed definitionof active treatment would result in providers devoting an extraordinaryamount of energy to making worthwhile services ``look right'' in orderto satisfy surveyors and maintain a viable funding source.Response: Compliance with active treatment is not assessed in a vacuum.It can only be done as part of a process that considers every aspect ofthe client's behavior from the functional assessment phase, up to and including,on-site observations of the client in structured and unstructured environments.Therefore, to address adequately the specific situations that the commenterdescribes, we would have to study a client's assessment and other relevantcircumstances affecting the client's behavior.We believe the regulations clearly require facilities to use resourcesto improve the skill levels of their clients and not merely to make services``look right''. Throughout the regulations, we have emphasized the importanceof results and outcomes, and have placed minimal importance on requiredprocesses.S. Admissions, Transfers and Discharges (Proposed andSection;442.442; FinalandSection;483.450(b))<T3>Comment:</T3> Twenty-two commenters objected to the proposed requirementto allow a facility to admit only those clients for whom it can provideneeded active treatment services. Several commenters expressed concernthat the proposed standard could cause an adverse effect on clients inthe following situations: court ordered commitments, emergency admissions,emergency respite cases, and delayed discharges due to lack of availablealternative placements. Some suggested that the existing standard at andSection;442.418(c)that allows inappropriate admissions on a temporary basis should be retained.Others suggested that exceptions to the proposed standard should be allowedfor up to 90 days.Response: The statute at 1905(d)(2) of the Act stipulates that for FFPto be available for services provided to a client in an ICF/MR, the clientmust be receiving active treatment. Therefore, we are retaining in thisfinal rule the proposed requirement that a facility must admit only thoseclients for whom it can privide needed active treatment services. We recognizethat a facility may be required to admit individuals based on the orderof a court. Although we do not have the jurisdiction to prevent the courtsfrom ordering placements of clients who do not need active treatment inICFs/MR, there is no implication that these clients automatically mustbe classified by Medicaid as being eligible for the ICF/MR benefit.We must emphasize that the presence of any group of clients could callinto question the overall nature of the services provided. If the primarypurpose of the facility is no longer to provide services to the personswith mental retardation or related conditions, the facility would no longerqualify as an ICF/MR.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters recommended that the rule allow facilitiesto provide clients with active treatment services either directly or throughadministrative arrangements.Response: We agree. Therefore, we have deleted the reference to clients``for whom the facility can provide needed services'' that appeared inthe proposed rule at andSection;442.440(b) so that the final rule at andSection;483.410(d)allows facilities the flexibility to provide or arrange for the provisionof needed active treatment services. However, the facility remains responsiblefor all services furnished to its clients.<T3>Comment:</T3> Eight commenters objected to the proposal to requirethat the preadmission evaluation must be completed or updated no more than90 days before admission. Some of these commenters suggested alternativetime frames such as: 365 days for developmental assessments, and 180 daysfor any assessment conducted on a severely or profoundly retarded individual.Others recommended that we eliminate any specific time frame, and onlyrequire that the facility use current assessment data.Response: The intent of the proposed standard was to ensure that admissiondecisions were based on current and valid information. However, we recognizethat to require that this information be updated or completed no more than90 days before admission is somewhat arbitrary. Therefore, in accordancewith our commitment to stress result-oriented standards, we have deletedthe 90 day timeframe and have modified the rule, so that the final regulationsrequire that admission decisions be based on currently valid assessments.<T3>Comment:</T3> A few commenters expressed concern because the proposedrule did not specifically mention nutritional status as one of the itemsthat must be evaluated as part of the client's comprehensive assessment.In their opinion, an evaluation of nutritional status should be includedbecause it is essential to understanding the client's physical status.Response: It was our intent that an evaluation of the client's nutritionalstatus would be included as part of the comprehensive assessments. However,we agree that unless nutritional status is specifically mentioned in therule, it may not be included as part of the client's assessment. Therefore,we have revised the regulations to state explicitly that nutritional statusis one of the items that must be evaluated as part of the client's assessmentthat is used by the facility in making admission decisions. We note thatin the final rule, we refer to this assessment as a ``preliminary'', nota ``comprehensive'', assessment since it is completed before the client'sadmission to a facility. Also, in the final rule, we have referred to theassessments conducted after admissions by the interdisciplinary team (proposedin andSection;442.444(c)) as comprehensive assessments.<T3>Comment:</T3> About one-third of the commenters objected to the proposedrule at andSection;442.442(b)(3) and andSection;442.464(a)(1) because it wouldrequire that a physician be involved in the development of each client'sIPP. Some of these commenters stated that physician involvement in thedevelopment of a client's IPP should be required only if it is determinedthat it is ``appropriate'' or ``needed''. Other commenters thought a nurseshould be able to serve as a representative for the physician. Severalcommenters stated that physicians should be able to participate by meansof a written report, or through the review and approval of the IPP within7 days of its development. Finally, some commenters felt that this requirementwas too aligned to the medical model and would increase the costs of theprogram without providing any significant benefit to the client.Response: Section 1903(g)(1)(B) of the Act requires, in part, that servicesprovided to Medicaid recipients in ICFs must be furnished under a planestablished and periodically reviewed and evaluated by a physician. Theregulations implementing the statute are at andSection;456.380. This sectionspecifically requires a physician to establish a written plan of care foreach applicant or recipient before he or she is admitted or before paymentmay be authorized. Consistent with the statute and andSection;456.380, thisrule requires that a physician must participate in the establishment ofa client's IPP.In developing an IPP, the team must study all of the client's needs, bothmedical and non-medical, and how these needs are interrelated. Therefore,participation by a physician is required to ensure that an assessment ofthe client's medical status is thoroughly considered and addressed by theteam as it develops the IPP. Thus, the intent of the rule is to requirethat a physician must have input into the development of the IPP, ratherthan merely review or approve the IPP. This input may be by means of writtenreports, evaluations, and recommendations. However, the input must be fromthe physician, and not from a person, such as a nurse, who is serving asthe physician's representative.As the commenters pointed out, the requirement that a physician be involvedin the development of each client's IPP appeared in two of the proposedstandards. In order to eliminate duplication, we have deleted this provisionunder the standard concerning admissions, transfers and discharges andretained it under the standard concerning physician participation (andSection;483.460(b)).<T3>Comment:</T3> Thirty-one commenters requested clarification concerninghow many days the facility has to develop the client's initial IPP. Twenty-eightcommenters said it was unclear because the proposed standard at andSection;442.442(b)(3) would require that at the time of admission, a physicianmust be involved in the development of the initial IPP and seemed to conflictwith the proposed rule at andSection;442.444(d) that would allow up to 30days after admission for the interdisciplinary team to develop the IPP.Response: ``At the time of admission'' means during the admission processwhich extends from when the client is admitted to the time the initialIPP is completed.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters requested clarification of the meaningof the terms ``transfers'', ``discharges'' and ``good cause''.Response: Interpretive guidelines will explain that transfer means thetemporary movement between facilities or permanent movement between livingunits of the same facility. Discharge means the permanent movement of aclient to another residence that is not under the jurisdiction of the facility'sgoverning body.Moving a client for ``good cause'' means for any reason that is in thebest interest of the client. Also, we believe the client, family, or guardianshould be provided with sufficient time to prepare for any move (exceptin emergencies). The exact amount of time cannot be specified, since itwill depend upon the reasons for the move, the effect it will have on theclient and the client's family or guardian, and the type of adjustmentsthat will have to be made to prepare for the change. Moreover, the familyand client usually should be involved in the initial stages of any decisionto move a client, since these decisions generally should be part of a teamprocess that includes the client and his or her family or guardian. Also,if a client has an advocate, the advocate should participate in the decisionmaking process. We recognize that the decision to move a client often resultsin disagreements, uncertainties and conflicting interests. Therefore, webelieve that it is important to require that there must be a good reasonfor deciding to move a client, and that the decision takes into considerationwhat best serves the interests and the needs of the client.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters asked if the facility is responsiblefor implementing the post-discharge plan. Other commenters asked if theclient or guardian refuses to consent to the release of the client's dischargesummary, would this prevent a client from being discharged. These commentersalso asked whether a doctor's order was needed to discharge a client.Response: A facility is required to develop a discharge plan of care forevery client for whom it will no longer have responsibility as a resultof the person moving to a new living environment. However, for purposesof certification, the facility would not be responsible for implementingthis plan of care, since the client would be living in a new environmentover which the facility has no authority or administrative control.Discharge summaries are required to facilitate a client's transition toa new living environment. Therefore, if appropriate consent is given, adischarge summary should be made available to the new agency. However,failure to obtain consent for release of the discharge summary should notpreclude a client from being discharged. Also, although an agency may decideto secure a physician's order before discharging a client, this is notrequired by the regulations.T. Individual Program Plan (Proposed andSection; 442.444; Final andSection;483.440(c))<T3>Comment:</T3> Ten commenters requested further clarification concerningwho should be appointed to the interdisciplinary team required by the proposedrule at andSection; 442.444(a). They believe HCFA should specify the minimumnumber and type of individuals who must participate on an interdisciplinaryteam.Response: In accordance with the proposed and final rules, a facility mustestablish for each client an interdisciplinary team that consists of thoseindividuals who have the expertise required to design an effective planthat meets the needs of the client. Thus, the expertise that must be representedon a team is a case-by-case determination based on each client's needsas identified by the current comprehensive functional assessment. Therefore,we do not agree that the regulations should include more specific requirementsregarding who should serve on an interdisciplinary team.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter objected to the proposal at andSection; 442.444(c) and (d) that would require that the initial assessment of the clientand the development of the IPP must be completed within 30 days after admission.This commenter suggested that 45 days after admission would be a more reasonabletime frame for completing the initial assessment and the IPP.Response: We disagree. The required time frame for completing the initialassessment and the IPP has been within 30 days after admission since theinception of the ICF/MR program. The 30 day requirement also is currentlyused in the ACDD standards. We believe it is commonly held by those whowork in the field of mental retardation that 30 days is a reasonable lengthof time to complete the initial assessment and IPP for a newly admittedclient.<T3>Comment:</T3> Section 442.444(c)(5) of the proposed rule would requirea facility to provide clients, ``as applicable'', with certain developmentalassessments (including for example, assessments of affective development,vocational skills, and independent skills). Two commenters objected tothe phrase, ``as applicable'', since they believe that all clients needto receive these assessments. Another commenter objected to this proposedprovision because it would require an assessment of the independent livingskills of all clients, even if it appears that the client will never beable to live in the community. An additional commenter wanted clarificationas to what extent the team should identify a client's needs, if the servicesnecessary to meet those needs are not available in the community.Response: With respect to the use of the phrase ``as applicable'', we agreethat it did not clearly convey what we intended. Therefore, we have movedit so that it only modifies the ``vocational skills'' assessment category.Regarding the requirement to assess a client's needs, our intent is toensure that each client receives a comprehensive functional evaluationthat identifies all of his or her developmental needs, regardless of theavailability of services to meet those needs. Thus, each client must receivea full and comprehensive assessment, irrespective of the availability ofservices to meet the client's needs, or the costs that would be involvedin providing the services. Also, we believe that it is necessary to assessa client's independent living skills, even if it may seem that the clientwill never be able to live in the community. This part of the assessmentis important in order for the team to have a complete and comprehensiveevaluation that identifies all of the client's needs and strengths. Ithas been our experience that facilities, which assess clients' independentliving skills, often unexpectedly discover that clients may already possesssome of these skills, having learned them prior to initial residentialplacement.<T3>Comment: </T3>Sixteen commenters expressed concern that the list ofassessment categories in the proposed rule at andSection;442.444(c)(5) didnot include all of the categories needed to ensure that the assessmentswould be comprehensive. Thirteen of the commenters recommended that thefollowing assessment categories be added to the list: feeding and menuplanning by a registered dietitian; leisure and interpersonal communicationskills; psychosocial skills; and social work needs. Also, one commenterrecommended that the rule should require that the team must use only assessmentprocedures that have been demonstrated to be empirically reliable and valid.Response: We do not agree that it is necessary to include in the rule allthe additional assessment categories suggested by the commenters. However,to ensure that the assessments are comprehensive, we have amended the proposedlanguage to include the following two additional assessment categories:nutritional status and social development. With the addition of these twocategories, we believe the items listed will ensure that the clients receivecomprehensive assessments. Also, it is our intent by this standard to requirethat the assessment data used by the team must be relevant and valid, andthat the skills, abilities, and training needs identified by the assessmentcorrespond to the client's actual status. Even though it is implicitlyrequired that facilities must use assessment procedures that accuratelydescribe the client's current status, we have amended the regulation atandSection;483.440(c)(3) explicitly to require accurate assessments. <T3>Comment: </T3>Seven commenters asked whether the proposed requirementthat the IPP state specific objectives for individual needs at andSection;442.444(d)meant that a separate IPP objective must be developed for each of the client'sneeds identified by the assessment or only for those needs that have beengiven priority. Two commenters stated that, because of the contingenciesinvolved, projected completion dates could not be assigned accurately toIPP objectives. Therefore, they believed that the proposed standard atandSection;442.444(d)(2) should be changed to require review dates instead.Response: The intent of the standard is to require that for each of theclient's identified needs, there should be a corresponding IPP objectivedesigned to meet that need. After all the objectives have been established,they should be ranked in order of importance as determined by the client'sdevelopmental needs. Objectives considered to be most important, or thatneed to be implemented before others can be accomplished, should be assignedpriority. For each objective given priority, the team should assign a projecteddate by which it believes it can accomplish the desired outcome. Also,at least annually the team should review all of the client's performancedata and the projected dates of completion for each objective, so thatit can make any necessary revisions to ensure the accuracy of the plan.We believe developing projected dates of completion is an integral partof the planning process because it requires the team to determine whata client must do to accomplish a particular IPP objective, and to assessthe client's potential for achieving a desired outcome. <T3>Comment: </T3>One person objected to the proposal at andSection;442.444(d)(1)to require that IPP objectives be stated separately, in terms of a singlebehavioral outcome, since this would be too limiting. Two other commentersexpressed concern that the proposal to require that the organization ofIPP objectives reflect developmental progressions would force facilitiesto adhere strictly to child development standards. Response: We have retained the requirement that IPP objectives be statedin terms of single outcomes because if multiple outcomes are used, clientperformance cannot always be clearly monitored or recorded. The requirementthat IPP objectives be organized to reflect a developmental progressiondoes not mean that clients must ``learn'' skills in the same sequence aschildren do as they grow up. The proposal specified and these final regulationswill specify that the objectives be organized to reflect a developmentalprogression ``appropriate to the individual''. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 442.444(d) of the proposed rule would requirethat the IPP must include specific objectives that meet the client's individualneeds. A few commenters suggested that we revise this section to requirea facility to identify also the purpose or outcome it plans to achieveby accomplishing a series of IPP objectives. Another commenter suggestedthat the term ``accomplishment'' should be used in place of the word ``performance''in the proposal to require that IPP objectives be expressed in behavioralterms that provide measurable indices of performance. This commenter suggestedthat by replacing the word ``performance'' with the word ``accomplishment'',we would require facilities to provide more exact indices for measuringthe client's rates of progression or regression. Response: We do not agree that a facility should be required to identifythe outcome or purpose it plans to achieve by accomplishing a series ofIPP objectives. We believe such a requirement would be too prescriptive.However, we propose to require, and the final rule retains the provision,that the IPP must state what planned sequence of specific objectives hasbeen established to meet the client's needs. For the facility to establisha planned sequence of objectives for each client, it will have to considerthe outcomes and goals it plans to achieve. Also, we do not agree withthe suggestion that the term ``accomplishment'' be substituted for theterm ``performance''. We believe that the term ``performance'' adequatelyconveys the concept that a facility must be able to measure accuratelya client's progress or regression. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter objected to the proposal at andSection;442.444(d)(6)to require that the IPP include the programs and strategies to be usedin achieving plan objectives. This commenter suggested that, since theIPPs are not always found in locations accessible to direct care staff,we should require instead that the programs and strategies be availableto direct care staff, rather than require that they be included or locatedin the IPP. Response: We agree that the strategies and programs that are to be usedto achieve IPP objectives should be kept in a location that is readilyaccessible to staff. This was our intent in requiring that the strategiesand programs be included within the IPP. However, as a result of the comments,we have deleted the requirement that the progarms and strategies must beincluded within the IPP. The final regulations at andSection;483.440(c)(6)(ii)will require that program strategy information be available to relevantstaff and that the IPP identify where this information can be found. Itwill be left to the discretion of the facility to arrive at an effectivemeans of accomplishing this. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed concern about the proposed ruleat andSection;442.444(e) that would require a facility to emphasize personalcare skills in IPPs. The commenter mentioned that some clients, becauseof extreme and permanent physical limitations, might never be able to achievethe physical dexterity necessary to perform personal care skills. In thesecases, the commenter suggested that for a client to describe or communicatehis or her basic needs to a caretaker, may be the highest level of independenceand self-help that the client can achieve. Response: We agree. The proposed list of examples of personal care skills(bathing, self feeding, etc.) that must be included in the IPP, for thoseclients who lack them, did not include ``communication of basic needs''.Therefore, we have added this skill to the list.<T3>Comment: </T3>Eighteen commenters questioned the proposed regulationat andSection; 442.444(e) that would require individual program plans toemphasize personal care skills. These commenters stated that personal careskills are not the only types of skills or training that should be emphasizedin the IPP. Moreover, they believed the rule should require that the IPPmust include any skill necessary to help the client achieve greater independence.They also questioned what was meant by the term ``developmentally incapable''as used in the proposed requirement that the IPP emphasize personal careskills until it has been demonstrated that the client is developmentallyincapable of acquiring them.Response: To ensure that all the items included in an IPP are given sufficientimportance, we have modified the proposed language. Although in the finalrule, we will not require that emphasis be placed on personal care skills,we will require that the IPP include training in personal care skills forthose clients who lack them. Also, we have retained the proposed languagethat identifies those personal care skills that are most fundamental toa person's dignity, privacy, and independence, and that must be taughtto those clients who are capable of acquiring them.We have revised the proposed rule at andSection; 442.444(e) (andSection; 483.440(c)(6)(iii)of this final rule), which would have required that a client must be trainedin personal care skills until he or she has acquired these skills or ithas been demonstrated that he or she is developmentally incapable of acquiringthem. The phrase, ``until the client has acquired these skills,'' has beendeleted, because the single concept that we wanted to convey was that clients,should receive training in personal care skills until it has been demonstratedthat they are ``developmentally incapable'' of acquiring them. The demonstrationthat a client is ``developmentally incapable'' of acquiring personal careskills, we believe must be made by the interdisciplinary team based onits assessment of the client's developmental strengths and needs.<T3>Comment: </T3>Seven commenters expressed concern about the proposedrequirement at andSection; 442.444(b) that parents or guardians must participatein the interdisciplinary team meetings unless their participation is unobtainableor inappropriate. Some commenters felt that participation by parents orguardians should be encouraged rather than required. Other commenters suggestedthat the team should be required to discuss with parents what is to beincluded in the IPP, but that parents should not be required to attendteam meetings.Response: The purpose of active treatment is to assist the client is achievingmaximum possible independence. For this to be done successfully, we believethat direct participation in team meetings by the client, the client'sparents (if the client is a minor) or appointed legal guardian should berequired, unless inappropriate. If the client is a minor or an adult whohas been adjudicated incompetent, then direct participation by the parentor an appointed legal guardian is essential to ensuring that the client'sinterests are given sufficient consideration. In the interest of the client,the participation of the parents of minors, and the legal guardians ofthose adjudicated incompetent, should be solicited to the maximum extentpossible. Our experience has shown that clients are generally willing tohave their parents participate in the planning process. However, if theclient is an adult who is competent to make decisions and who is not adjudicated,parents may not participate in the interdisciplinary process if their participationis opposed by the client.<T3>Comment: </T3>Four commenters expressed concern that the proposed ruleat andSection; 442.444(d), which would require the IPP to state specificobjectives, only referred to training objectives. Therefore, it would notrequire that other special activities and interventions needed by the clientbe specified in the IPP.Response: We have revised the proposed language so that the final rule,at andSection; 483.440(c)(6), requires the IPP to describe all the relevantinterventions that are needed to support the client towards independence.<T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters made recommendations about the proposedrule at andSection; 442.444(g), which would require that a copy of the IPPmust be made available to all relevant staff and to the client's familyor guardian. One commenter suggested that a written explanation or interpretationof the contents of the IPP, using clear and non-technical language, shouldbe sent by the social worker to the client's family. Another commenterstated that a copy of the IPP should be made accessible only to those familiesrequesting it. One commenter recommended that the rule require that facilitiesmust comply with State and Federal privacy laws when making informationavailable to staff or families.Response: We have retained the proposed language that would require thata copy of each client's IPP must be made available to the client's parentsor guardian. We also have added a requirement to the final rule that theIPP also must be made available to the client. While the suggestion tosend an explanation or interpretation of the IPP to the family has merit,we believe that as a requirement in the regulations, it would be too prescriptive.Nevertheless, although it is not required, an agency may mail a copy ofthe IPP to them. We do not believe it is necessary to make an additionalreference to State and Federal privacy laws, since these regulations atandSection; 483.410(b) require compliance with all applicable Federal, Stateand local laws.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters expressed concern about the proposed ruleat andSection; 442.444(f), which would require multihandicapped clients tospend a major portion of each day out of their beds and outside the bedroomarea, moving about by various methods and devices whenever possible. Thecommenters stated that this requirement should be waived if contraindicatedby the qualified mental retardation professional or by the physician. Response: We disagree. We believe that except for those clients who areacutely ill (such as those who are hospitalized or incapacitated by a shortterm illness), all clients should be out of bed and outside their bedroomarea for as long as possible each day. Mentally retarded or developmentallydisabled people are not sick because they are mentally retarded or developmentallydisabled. Therefore, they should not be treated as sick people unless theybecome ill. Consistent with the developmental model, to the extent possible,the routines and schedules of a client's day should resemble those of anynon-handicapped person.U. Program Implementation (Proposed andSection; 442.446; Final andSection;483.440(d))<T3>Comment: </T3>The proposed regulation at andSection; 442.446(a) wouldrequire a facility to implement a ``continuous'' active treatment programfor each client. Forty-seven commenters requested a clarification concerningwhat is meant by a ``continuous active treatment program.'' These commentersexpressed concern that this phrase seemed to mean that facilities wouldbe required to provide every client with 24 hours of structured programmingeach day, and that the clients would have no time during the day for recreationand unstructured activities. They stated that such a requirement was unreasonableand would make it impossible for clients to live by a normal schedule.Therefore, they recommended that we delete the word ``continuous,'' andinstead specify the minimum number of hours per day that active treatmentmust be provided.Response: We disagree. The word ``continuous,'' as used in the proposedrule, was meant to convey the principle that active treatment is not themere provision of structured training and treatment services within certainscheduled time intervals. The word ``continuous'' was used to convey theconcept that active treatment is not a static program, but an ongoing processthat provides clients with needed training and treatment through appropriateand competent interactions and interventions that are applied to the client'sstructured and unstructured activities, in both formal and informal settings,and in sufficient number and frequency to assist the client effectivelyin accomplishing IPP objectives. Because active treatment is an ongoingand continuous process, it is not possible to specify the minimum numberof hours per day that active treatment is required, or the maximum lengthof time allowed between active treatment interventions.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters asked what time frame was intended bythe proposal at andSection; 444.446(a) to require the facility to begin implementingactive treatment as soon as the interdisciplinary team has formulated aclient's IPP. They were uncertain whether implementation had to begin immediatelyfollowing the IPP meeting, or whether the facility could wait until theIPP document had been written.Response: The facility must begin implementing an active treatment programfor a client as soon as the client's team has determined the type of programor plan of action that the client needs. Our intent is to ensure that aclient begins receiving active treatment as soon as possible after theteam identifies the client's needs through a comprehensive assessment.Thus, a facility should not delay implementation of active treatment becausethe written document identifying the contents of the IPP has not been completed.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested us to amend the proposed ruleto require, between the time of admission and the initial IPP meeting,a daily structured program for each newly admitted client.Response: We disagree. The time immediately following admission shouldbe primarily for the purpose of assisting the client to become adjustedand acclimated to his or her new living environment, and for the facilityto conduct the comprehensive functional assessment of the client's statusas required by andSection; 483.440(c). Therefore, we do not believe it wouldbe appropriate to require a daily structured program during this periodof time.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters asked how the active treatment schedule,required by the proposed regulations at andSection; 442.446(c), is differentfrom the IPP. Ten commenters objected to the proposed rule at andSection;442.446(c) that would require that the active treatment schedule be attachedto and distributed with the IPP. They stated that an active treatment scheduleis meaningless unless it is updated continually, and the amount of paperworkthat would be required to distribute copies of the active treatment scheduleand continually to update these copies would be excessive and counterproductive.Response: The IPP is the vehicle that a facility must use to develop, structureand implement an active treatment program for a particular client. It statesthe specific objectives and behavior outcomes that the team plans for theclient to achieve. As an adjunct to and in support of the IPP, the teamalso must establish an active treatment schedule that shapes the basicstructure of the clients experience throughout the day. The schedule givesform to the program and guides the work of the staff and clients and is,therefore, a vital organizational tool in the process of implementing anactive treatment program.Also, as recommended by the commenters, we are no longer requiring thatthe active treatment schedules be distributed with the IPPs. Instead, inkeeping with our intent to use outcome oriented standards, we have modifiedthe proposed language, so that the final rule at andSection; 483.440(d)(2)will require that active treatment schedules must be readily availablefor review by all relevant staff.<T3>Comment: </T3>Eleven commenters objected to the proposal at andSection;442.446(d) to require that an IPP be implemented by all staff who workwith the client. These commenters stated that every staff member who workswith a client is not qualified to implement every portion of the client'sIPP. Therefore, the rule should require only that there be an ``awareness''of the IPP by all staff.Response: We cannot accept this comment. The intent of the regulation isto require that all staff who have regular contact with clients, be knowledgeableof the IPPs for these clients and participate in implementing them. Forexample, if a client spends time regularly with any staff member, thenthe facility is responsible for ensuring that during this time, the staffmember is able to provide needed interventions or reinforce acquired skillsin accordance with the IPP. This is how the facility can implement a <T3>continuous</T3> active treatment program.<T3>Comment: </T3>To ensure that direct care staff are knowledgeable abouthow to implement the IPPs, one commenter suggested that we require themto meet with the qualified mental retardation professionals to discussand review the IPPs.Response: While we agree that direct care staff should be as knowledgeableas possible about the IPPs, we believe the commenter's suggestion of requiringmeetings between the qualified mental retardation professionals and directcare staff is too prescriptive.V. Program Documentation (Proposed andSection; 442.448; Final andSection; 483.440(e))<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters requested clarification concerningthe proposed requirement at andSection; 442.448(a) that client performancein relationship to the IPP was to be documented in measurable terms. Thesecommenters could not determine whether the regulation required documentationconsisting of raw data, progress notes, or data summaries. Furthermore,eight commenters asked how often this documentation was to be completed.Response: The intent of the proposal was to require that raw data be kepton each client's performance that would indicate whether or not IPP objectiveswere accomplished. However, the comments indicate that this intent wasnot clearly conveyed. Therefore, the proposed language has been revisedto include the word data. The final regulation at andSection; 483.440(e)(1)will require that ``Data relative to accomplishment of the criteria specifiedin client IPP objectives must be documented in measurable terms.'' Nevertheless,in addition to the raw data, a facility may decide to use supplementarymethods, such as progress summaries, to document client performance. Also,we believe that the facility should determine how often to document thedata, as long as the data are documented frequently enough to measure effectivelya client's performance.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked what specific types of client performancedata had to be collected to meet the proposed program documentation requirementsat andSection; 442.448(a).Response: The facility has the flexibility to determine the type of datait wishes to collect, as long as the data are relevant and can be usedto measure effectively the accomplishment of the objectives specified ineach client's IPP.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter inquired whether or not the data requiredby the proposal are to be collected on all IPP objectives or only on thosefor which training is currently being conducted.Response: Since the purpose of the data is to measure client performance,data must be collected only on those objectives for which training is beingcurrently provided.<T3>Comment: </T3>Twenty-six commenters objected to the proposed languageat andSection; 442.448(b) that states ``the facility must document that significantdevelopmental, behavioral and social objectives . . . have taken place.''Some of the commenters thought this language was confusing and submittedexamples of substitute language which they felt would clarify the meaningof the proposed requirement.Response: The proposed language has been revised to clarify our meaning.The final regulation at andSection; 483.440(e)(2) will require that the facilitymust document significant events that are related to the client's IPP andassessments, and that contribute to an overall understanding of the client'songoing level and quality of functioning.W. Program Monitoring and Change (Proposed andSection; 442.450; Final andSection;andSection;483.430(a) and 483.440(f))<T3>Comment: </T3>Fifty-two commenters expressed opinions about the qualificationswe proposed at andSection; 442.450(a), for the position of qualified mentalretardation professional. The proposed regulations state that each qualifiedmental retardation professional must have at least one year of experienceworking directly with individuals with mental retardation or other developmentaldisabilities, and be either a physician, a registered nurse, or have atleast a bachelor's degree in one of the professional service categorieslisted in the proposed regulations at andSection; 442.460(e). One commenterfelt that a master's degree should be the minimum requirement for any qualifiedmental retardation professional, since they are responsible for monitoringthe quality of professional services provided to clients. Another commentersuggested that any educational degree, accompanied by acceptable work experience,would be sufficient to qualify an individual to perform qualified mentalretardation professional duties. Typical of another group of commenterswas the strong opinion that requiring ``artificial'' credentials did notguarantee acceptable performance, and demonstration of competencies shouldbe stressed instead.Response: We believe that a certain level of professional qualificationis required for qualified mental retardation professionals because of theirimportant role in supervising the delivery of care and assisting clientsin meeting their developmental, behavioral and social needs. Thus, we haveretained the proposed requirements for a qualified mental retardation professional.However, in the final rule, we have specified, in order to clarify ourintent, that doctors of osteopathy are qualified to be qualified mentalretardation professionals as well as doctors of medicine.<T3>Comment: </T3>Fourteen commenters objected to the proposed requirementat andSection; 442.450(c)(1) that the interdisciplinary team must approveall changes made to the objectives of a client's IPP. These commentersexpressed concern that this requirement would increase administrative processingtime and costs without resulting in any significant gains for the clients.Response: The intent of the proposed rule was to ensure that the IPP wouldbe reviewed regularly and that the team would approve any changes thatwere made to the individual objectives of a client's IPP. We agree thatthis proposed requirement could be too prescriptive, especially since wehave retained the proposed requirement (at andSection; 483.440(f)(1) of thisfinal rule) that the IPP be reviewed and revised whenever a client accomplishesan objective, or is regressing or losing skills, or failing to progress.Therefore, we have revised the proposed language. The final rule will designatethe qualified mental retardation professional as the agent responsiblefor reviewing and revising the IPP as necessary. This is consistent withthe qualified mental retardation professional's responsibility to integrate,coordinate and monitor the IPP. However, the interdisciplinary team, inaccordance with the final rule at andSection; 483.440(f)(2), is responsiblefor revising each client's IPP, as appropriate, and for reviewing eachclient's comprehensive functional assessment for relevancy, at least annually,and for updating it as needed.<T3>Comment: </T3>Twelve commenters objected to the proposed regulationat andSection;442.450(c) because it does specify how often the IPP shouldbe reviewed between the required annual reviews. These commenters assertedthat facility staff could not be depended on to initiate reviews or revisionsof the IPP when necessary (such as when objectives have been completedor when strategies are proven ineffective), unless the regulation requiresthem to do so. They suggested several examples of specific time intervalsthat they thought should be included in the rule to indicate how oftenIPPs must be reviewed.Response: We do not believe it would be appropriate to specify in the rulehow often the IPP must be reviewed between the required annual reviews,since the number of times an IPP should be reviewed depends on many factors.As stated earlier in this preamble, andSection; 483.440(f)(1) of this finalrule will require the qualified mental retardation professional to reviewand revise the IPP as necessary, including, but not limited to, when theclient has successfully completed an objective, or is regaressing or losingskills, or is failing to progress, or is being considered for trainingtowards new objectives. Thus, because there are many factors that determinewhen a review is needed, we do not agree with the commenters' suggestion.<T3>Comment: </T3>Nine commenters objected to the proposal at andSection;442.450(a)(1)to require qualified mental retardation professionals to be employees ofthe facility. These commenters expressed the view that it may be cost prohibitivefor facilities, which serve very few clients, to hire someone full-timefor this function, especially when the service of a qualified mental retardationprofessional could be obtained more cost effectively through suitable arrangementswith an outside agency.Response: We agree. Although the qualified mental retardation professionaloccupies a key position in terms of monitoring and overseeing a client'sIPP, and we believe this role is central to the statutory active treatmentrequirements, we do not believe it is administratively feasible or costefficient to require that the qualified mental retardation professionalbe directly employed by the facility.<T3>Comment: </T3>Seventeen commenters expressed numerous opinions aboutthe requirement proposed at andSection; 442.450(e)(1), that a specially designedoutside committee must approve individual behavior management programsthat involve a potential risk to the client. Comments ranged from suggestionsfor deleting this requirement totally, to giving the committee more authorityand autonomy to do its job and requiring the committee to perform its oversightfunction at least quarterly. However, the concern expressed most frequentlyby commenters was that the membership of the committee should include individualswho have the expertise necessary to make appropriate decisions regardingthe facility's practices and programs.Response: The intent of the proposed regulation was to require a facilityto establish a committee or committees that would serve as an advocatefor the protection of the rights of individual clients, especially as theymay be affected by behavior management programs. Under the proposed rule,membership was to include representatives from the facility's staff, clients,parents, and persons with no ownership or control interest in the facility.However, we agree that the committee also should include a person or personswho are knowledgeable about current practices for controlling inappropriateclient behavior. Therefore, we have revised the proposed language, so thatthe final rule at andSection; 483.440(f)(3), will require that the facilitymust include on the committee the participation of a qualified person orpersons who have either experience or training in contemporary practicesto change inappropriate client behavior.<T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters inquired whether the required outsidecommittee have to review <T3>all </T3>IPP programs, or only those IPP programs that posed a potentialrisk to the client.Response: The final rule will require the specially constituted committeeto review at least those programs and facility practices that pose a potentialrisk to clients. However, as stated in the final rule, the committee isfree to review any area it believes needs to be addressed.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter wanted to know if a behavior managementprogram that involved potential risks for a client, could be implemented<T3>before </T3>it was approved by the outside committee.Response: The intent of the regulation is to require the approval of theoutside committee before such programs are implemented. This is to ensurethat if there are risks to the client that are unwarranted, the programswill not be implemented.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter inquired whether or not access to confidentialclient information by the outside committee's non-staff members would placethe facility out of compliance with the proposed rule at andSection; 442.432(b)that would require the facility to keep all client information confidential.Response: The committee needs to know relevant client information to functionproperly. Therefore, the facility could ask members to sign an agreementto maintain confidentiality if there is a concern in this regard.<T3>Comment: </T3>Fourteen commenters requested clarification about theproposed language at andSection; 442.450(e)(2) that would authorize the outsidecommittee to review, monitor and make suggestions concerning any areasthat it believes need to be addressed. Some of these commenters expressedconcern that the committee might try to run the facility or that it mightduplicate the role of other existing facility committees. Other commenterssuggested that the role of the outside committee should be limited to ``clientrisk'' issues exclusively.Response: The proposed rule would require a facility to establish a ``speciallyconstituted committee or committees,'' to protect client rights. The intentwas to allow a facility the flexibility to decide whether to use one advisorycommittee or to use as many committees as it chooses, as long as at leastone committee was established to protect client rights. As intended bythe proposed regulation, the role of the outside committee or committees,was not to dictate facility policy or control management. Rather, the roleof the committee was to review facility practices and programs in orderto make recommendations concerning the protection of client rights. Toclarify our intent in this area, the final rule at andSection; 483.440(f)(3)(i)states that the role of the committee is to review, monitor and make suggestionsto the facility about its practices and programs. It also requires thatindividual programs that involve risks to client protections and rightsmust be approved by the committee.<T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters supported the proposed rule at andSection;442.450(f) that would allow the requirement for an outside committee tobe waived if State law or regulations provide equivalent client protectionand consultation. However, the commenters suggested that the rule alsoshould allow this requirement to be waived if an applicable court decreerequires oversight mechanisms which result in equivalent client protections.These commenters pointed out that, in some instances, the oversight mechanismsestablished by judicial decrees are far more stringent than those requiredby the proposed rule.Response: We agree. We have amended the proposed rule so that the finalregulation at andSection; 483.440(f)(4) states that the provisions of therule that pertain to the specially constituted committee may be modifed,if, in the judgment of the survey agency, a court decree provides for equivalentclient protection and consultation.<T3>Comment: </T3>Six commenters objected to the proposed rule at andSection;442.450(d) that would require the facility, at least annually, to reassessthe client and make revisions to the IPP. These commenters stated thatit would be wasteful to require an annual assessment if the client's statushad not changed since the last assessment. They suggested that we allowthe team to determine how often it is necessary to reassess the client.Response: We agree. The language of the proposed rule did not convey clearlyout intent to allow the team to determine whether a client needs a newassessment. To clarify out intent, the final rule at andSection; 483.440(f)(2)will state that, at least annually, the assessment of each client mustbe <T3>reviewed </T3>by the interdisciplinary team for relevancy and updatedas needed.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter inquired whether the annual review of theIPP required by the proposed rule at andSection; 442.450(d) has to be conductedon the 365th day after the last review, by the 365th day after the lastreview, or within some other time interval.Response: The interpretive guidelines will explain that to meet this requirement,the annual review of the assessment and the IPP generally must be completedby the 365th day after the last review. This is consistent with currentregulations on utilization control at andSection; 456.360(b)(2)(i).<T3>Comment: </T3>Four commenters requested that HCFA specify in the rulethe maximum number of clients that a facility would be allowed to assignto the caseload of a qualified mental retardation professional. These commentersfelt that caseloads have been overextended in the past. They suggestedthat unless we specified what we consider to be an acceptable ratio ofqualified mental retardation professionals to clients, we would continueto perpetuate paperwork as the primary function of the qualified mentalretardation professional.Response: We disagree. Each client's active treatment program must be effectivelyintegrated, coordinated, monitored, reviewed, and revised, as necessary,by a qualified mental retardation professional. The number of qualifiedmental retardation professionals that a facility requires to provide theseservices effectively will vary depending on several factors including,but not limited to, how many clients it has, the needs of these clients,the number and qualifications of additional staff members, and other dutiesthat may be assigned to the qualified mental retardation professionals.Thus, since these types of factors must be considered on an individualbasis before a determination can be made, we do not believe it is feasibleto attempt to specify in the rule the maximum number of clients that maybe assigned to a qualified mental retardation professional. However, inthe final rule, we have stated at andSection; 483.430(b)(2) concerning professionalprogram services that qualified professional staff must be sufficient innumber to implement the IPP.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter wished to know if a client's individualprogram plan could be coordinated and monitored by more than one qualifiedmental retardation professional. Response: The interpretive guidelines will explain that a client's IPPmay be coordinated and monitored by more than one qualified mental retardationprofessional. However, there must be one qualified mental retardation professionalwho is assigned primary responsibility for coordinating the client's IPP.This qualified mental retardation professional is responsible for servingas the primary advocate for the client and for ensuring that monitoringfunctions delegated to other qualified mental retardation professionalsare completed appropriately. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked if the regulations required thata person designated as a qualified mental retardation professional hadto do the duties of a qualified mental retardation professional exclusively,or could the person be allowed to perform other professional staff dutiesin addition to the qualified mental retardation professional duties.Response: We believe that it is up to the facility to allocate staff resourcesin whatever manner it believes is necessary as long as it ensures thatthe qualified mental retardation professional function is performed effectivelyfor each client.X. Behavior Management (Proposed andSection;andSection; 442.452, 442.454, 442.456,442.458; final andSection; 483.450)The four sections of the proposed rule dealing with management of clientbehavior, andSection;andSection; 442.452 through 442.458, received the largestvolume of comments overall. Pertaining to these four sections, we receivedcomments from 83 different commenters. Most of the individual commentersraised issues that apply to several of the proposed sections. Due to thecross-cutting nature of these issues, we have grouped these four proposedsections together for the purpose of responding to public comments.<T3>Comment: </T3>A significant number of commenters expressed concernthat the way the proposed andSection;andSection; 442.452 through 442.458 wereorganized was confusing and lacking sufficient safeguards to protect clientsand ensure good practice. Several of these commenters submitted suggestedlanguage that would substantially revise the entire four sections. Manyof the commenters also referred to the statement in the preamble of theNPRM, that our intent, in issuing new regulations, was to be consistentwith accreditation standards published in 1983 by the Accreditation Councilon Services for People with Developmental Disabilities (ACDD). They suggestedthat to the extent possible, we use the language of the ACDD standardsin the regulations.Response: We agree that the requirements of these four sections neededto be revised for purposes of clarification. To express our intent moreclearly, we have reorganized the four standards pertaining to the managementof client behavior into five. These are grouped under the condition ofparticipation at andSection; 483.450 of the final rule. In revising the proposedrule, we used in some instances the language of the ACDD directly, andin other instances, we borrowed heavily from the commenters.<T3>Comment: </T3>Six commenters criticized andSection;andSection; 442.452through 442.458 of the proposed rule because in their opinion, the techniquesmentioned in these sections (for example, time-out devices, aversive conditioning,drugs for behavior management, and physical restraints) did not reflectthe ``state of the art'' technology used in the field of mental retardationand developmental disabilities.Response: We made no attempt to determine what constitutes state-of-the-arttechniques in the field of mental retardation. Instead, we attempted toensure that whatever techniques are utilized by facilities to protect clientsfrom abusive or neglective practices are appropriate. <T3>Comment: </T3>Nine commenters objected to andSection;andSection; 442.452through 442.458 of the proposed rule because they believe these sectionsare too negative. They stated that the use of positive approaches, includingpositive reinforcement, known to be effective in managing inappropirateclient behavior, was not required nor emphasized sufficiently. They alsorequested that the rule include a description of those positive principlesthat a facility should follow in the development of its policies, proceduresand specific programs regarding the management of inappropriate clientbehavior. Response: The purpose of the entire active treatment section of the finalrule is to require facilities to provide positive environments and trainingmethodologies that will result in clients acquiring more adaptive behavior.Also, the final rule incorporates several suggestions that were made bycommenters on how to strengthen and emphasize the use of positive approachesto behavior management. For example, andSection; 483.450(a)(ii) of the finalrule regarding conduct toward clients, requires the facility to emphasizeand accommodate client choice, self-determination, and self-managementin the daily decision-making process. Also, in the final rule andSection;483.450(b), regarding management of inappropriate client behavior, requiresnot only that the facility guarantee that it will use the least restrictrive/leastintrusive techniques that are effective to manage client behavior, butalso that the client's safety, welfare, and human rights will be adequaltyprotected at the same time.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter objected to the proposed rule because itallows use of aversive techniques to manage client behavior. The commenterstated that research evidence does not support the efficacy of aversive,behavioral interventions. Also, the use of aversives to manage client behaviorraises disturbing legal and ethical issues, and diminishes the dignityof the client. Furthermore, the commenter suggested that HCFA specificallyprohibit the use of any technique to manage inappropriate client behaviorthat would deprive clients of nutritional food or hydration, or that wouldinflict pain, whether physical or psychological, or that would use chemicalrestraint in place of programming.Response: Varying opinions exists on the efficacy of these techniques.Rather than prohibiting techniques, our role is to ensure that if aversivesare used, adequate safeguards are included. Sometimes these techniquesare more successful in halting severe, self-injurious behavior and othergrotesque behaviors, than more positive methods would be. However, we dobelieve that client protections are necessary to safeguard clients againstthe misuse of these techniques. As originally proposed, to ensure thatthese techniques are properly used, the final rule at andSection; 483.420(d)(1)(ii)prohibits staff from disciplining a client by withholding adequate foodor hydration. The final rule at andSection; 483.450(b)(3) will require thatany technique used to manage inappropriate client behavior (including drugs)cannot be used as a substitute for an active treatment program. The finalrule at andSection; 483.450(e)(2) will require that drugs used for controlof inappropriate behavior must be used only as an integral part of an IPP.It also will prohibit at andSection; 483.420 (a)(5) and (d)(1)(i) physical,verbal, sexual or psychological abuse or punishment.<T3>Comment: </T3>Seventeen commenters criticized our interchangeable useof the terms ``behavior management'' and ``behavior modification,'' sincethe terms are not synonymous. These commenters stated that behavior modificationis only one specific model within the field of behavior management, yetas used throughout the proposed andSection; 442.454, behavior modificationappears to encompass every type of program designed to alter or shape behavior.For example, in the proposal, andSection; 442.454(b) refers to the use ofdrugs for ``behavior modification purposes'', and andSection; 442.458(b)refers to ``drugs used for behavior management''.Response: We agree that the two terms are not synonymous, and as used throughoutthe proposed rule, could cause confusion. Our intent in the proposed andSection;442.452 was to regulate ``conduct toward clients by facility staff,'' andour intent in the proposed andSection; 442.454 was to regulate the ``managementof inappropriate client behavior.'' Thus, we have renamed these standardsaccordingly. Also, in the final rule, the terms ``behavior management ''and ``behavior modification'' are not used in these specific standards,and other editorial changes have been made to describe our intent moreclearly.<T3>Comment:</T3> Seven commenters urged HCFA to include provisions inthe final rule that would prohibit facilities from using restrictive techniquesas part of an ongoing ``program'' or from making routine ``programmaticusage'' of these techniques, unless there is evidence to justify such usage.These commenters believe that such ongoing ``programs'' or ``programmaticusages'' of restrictive techniques are viewed by staff as a ``standingorder,'' to allow these techniques to be used. Therefore, they believesuch ``programs'' are used to justify putting clients back into restrictivedevices, even though their behavior does not warrant this. They believealso that the use of such ``programs'' makes it almost impossible to trackthe effectiveness of less restrictive techniques; and encourages teamsto use aversive techniques in anticipation of behavior that may never happenor may happen only infrequently.Response: We agree with the commenters' concerns. Restraining devices andtime-out rooms should not be used to suit the convenience of the staff,to accommodate staffing shortages, or to substitute for effective activetreatment. Therefore, we have revised the proposal to state at andSection;483.450(b)(3), that techniques to manage inappropriate client behaviormust never be used for staff convenience or as a substitute for an effectiveactive treatment program. Also, the final rule, at andSection; 483.450(b)(5),will prohibit the use of standing or as needed programs to control inappropriatebehavior; at andSection; 483.450(d)(4) it will require that clients mustbe released from restraining devices as quickly as possible; and at andSection;483.450(d)(1)(ii), it will stipulate that restraints may not be used asan emergency measure unless the client's behavior threatens self or others.<T3>Comment:</T3> Some commenters requested that, for purposes of emphasis,we move to the beginning of andSection; 442.454, the requirement proposedat andSection; 442.454(f), that less restrictive methods of managing behaviormust be attempted and documented to have failed before more restrictivetechniques, are employed. They believed that changing the location of thisrequirement would highlight for facilities that the use of positive behaviorshaping techniques should always be the first method of choice.Response: We agree that emphasis should be focused on the importance ofusing positive means for changing behavior. Thus, the proposal has beenrevised so that the standard at andSection; 483.450(b) concerning the managementof inappropriate client behavior will include the requirement that a facilitymust rank all the interventions it wishes to use to manage inappropriateclient behavior along a hierarchy ranging in order from the most positiveor least intrusive procedures, to the least positive or most intrusiveprocedures, and then implement them in that order. Moreover, a programusing more restrictive techniques may not be used before programs usingless intrusive techniques have been demonstrated to be ineffective.<T3>Comment:</T3> Three commenters felt that the proposed rule at andSection;442.454(f), which requires facilities to demonstrate that more positive,less intrusive techniques are ineffective, before using more intrusiveprocedures, was too strict and did not allow a facility to use state-of-the-arttechnology to manage client behavior. Commenters suggested that this requirementshould be waived if the team determines that less restrictive techniquesof managing behavior would be unlikely to succeed.Response: We agree that the team should determine what techniques are tobe used with clients. However, the intent of the final rule, at andSection;483.450(b), is to protect clients' rights, and to ensure that the leastrestrictive technique, which can effectively change the client's behavior,is employed. Thus, the team is responsible to establish sufficient documentationand clear evidence to justify the use of a more restrictive technique.This standard does not take away the team's discretion, it only requiresthat there be evidence to support the team's decision not to use a lessrestrictive technique.<T3>Comment:</T3> Sixteen commenters requested that we include a sectionin the final rule to define the techniques relevant to managing clientbehavior and specify the conditions under which these techniques can orcannot be used. Examples of techniques that commenters suggested be includedin this section are: time-out; aversive conditioning; aversive techniques;physical restraints; drugs for behavior management; corporal punishment;psychological punishment; behavior modification; and behavior management.Response: We do not agree that the regulations should specify what techniquesa facility may use to manage client behavior. However, in the interpretiveguidelines, we plan to provide more information concerning the meaningand use of behavioral management techniques. It should be noted that someof the terms that the commenters have requested us to define, have beendeleted from the final rule.<T3>Comment:</T3> Thirty commenters objected to our use of the term ``physicalrestraint'' throughout the proposed andSection; 442.456 dealing with physicalrestraints. Commenters expressed concern that unless the term ``physicalrestraint'' was defined, the requirements pertaining to the use of physicalrestraints could be applied inappropriately to devices that assist in thepositioning of clients or facilitate the implementation of time-limitedmedical procedures. The commenters suggested that we define the term ``physicalrestraint'' and that separate provisions be included for positioning andmedical restraining devices.Response: Interpretive guidelines will define a physical restraint as anyphysical or mechanical device that the client is unable to remove easily,and that either restricts the free movement of the client, or the movementor normal function of a portion of the client's body, or deprives the clientaccess to a portion or portions of the client's body. It was not our intentthat the proposed physical restraint requirements should be applied todevices used for client positioning or for medical procedures. Therefore,we have accepted the commenters' criticism that this needs to be clarified,and we have made two revisions. In the final rule, andSection; 483.440(c)(6)(iv)concerning IPPs specifically provides for the use of mechanical supportingdevices. The other revision is located at andSection; 483.450(d)(1)(iii)of the final rule, which allows facilities to use restraints as time-limited,physician prescribed, health-related, protective devices.<T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters requested clarification concerning whocan authorize the use of physical restraints for a client. The commenterssuggested that only a physician, or a physician together with a qualifiedmental retardation professional, should be allowed to authorize the useof physical restraints.Response: We have modified the proposed requirement that the facility identifywho can authorize restraints. The final rule at andSection; 483.450(d) allowsthe interdisciplinary team to authorize the use of physical restraintsas part of an IPP. The rule also recognizes that on occasion, emergencyusage of restraints might need to occur. We believe that it would be tooprescriptive to dictate to a facility who the authorizing person must befor emergency usage.<T3>Comment: </T3>Nine commenters objected to the proposed rule at andSection;442.456(c) because they believe that written authorizations for restraintsnot used as part of a behavior modification program, should not be allowedto be in effect for up to 12 hours. These commenters also objected to theproposed rule at andSection; 442.456(h), because they believe facilitiesshould be required to release clients for more than a ten minute periodfor each two hours that a restraint is applied. They maintain that anyclient placed in a restriant for two straight hours, would forget why therestraint had been applied. They were especially concerned about how thiswould affect a client who was placed in a restraint for two or more consecutivetwo hour periods. They thought that such consecutive restraint applicationswould constitute punishment. They opposed allowing written authorizationfor restraints not used as part of an integrated program, to be in effectfor up to 12 hours, because they believe such authorizations should beused only in the case of an emergency, and emergencies generally do notlast for that length of time.Response: We believe that allowing an authorization for the emergency useof a physical restraint to be in effect for up to 12 hours is appropriate.A 12-hour authorization does not mandate that a client must be placed ina physical restraint for 12 hours. It means that a client's situation isso unstable that the facility has determined that the continued or intermittentuse of a physical restraint might be needed, and that official authorizationfor usage can occur for a 12-hour period. We also do not agree with thecommenter's who preferred more frequent releases of restraints (for example,release for 10 minutes every hour rather than every two hours as was proposed).We note that the ACDD in their past and recently released new standardsrequire release for ten minutes every two hours. We do not believe thatit is appropriate to require a more stringent standard than that developedby experts. Also, to ensure the appropriate use of restraints, the finalrule at andSection; 483.450(d)(4) requires that a client must be releasedfrom a restraint as quickly as possible, and must be checked every 30 minuteswhile the restraint is applied. <T3>Comment: </T3>Five commenters objected to the proposed rule at andSection;442.456(e) because they believe that clients placed in restraints sholdbe checked more often than every 30 minutes. They expressed concern thata 30-minute interval between checks was too long and that it may be traumatizingfor some clients to be left alone for that length of time. Commenters'suggestions ranged from requiring checks every 15 minutes, to requiring``continuous'' observation by staff. Response: We do not agree that the interval should be shortened. The proposedrule stated and this final rule states that a client must be checked atleast every 30 minutes by staff. We believe that to ensure a client's physicalsafety, it is sufficient to check a client at least once every 30 minutes.However, we recognize that in some cases a client's psychological and physicalwell being might be enhanced by more frequent checks, and for some of theseclients continuous visual supervision might be appropriate. It is alsotrue that for some manipulative clients, constant visual supervision orvery frequent checks would serve to reinforce inappropriate behavior andthereby reduce the clinical effectiveness of using the restraint. Therefore,constant or very frequent monitoring may be helpful for some clients andcontraindicated for others. Our purpose is not to address every particularcase, but to stipulate that, as a minimum requirement, all clients in restraintsmust be checked at least every 30 minutes. In the final rule, this requirementis found at andSection; 483.450(d)(4). <T3>Comment: </T3>Four commenters requested us to modify the proposed ruleat andSection; 442.456(h) that would require that the opportunity for motionand exercise must be provided for a period of not less than 10 minutesduring every two hours that a restraint is applied. Commenters suggestedthat if a restraint was worn by a client all night long, it would be unreasonableto wake the client to take the restraint off for 10 minutes every two hours.They suggested that we add to the regulations that the opportunity for10 minutes of motion every two hours must be provided only when a clientis wearing the restraint and awake. Response: We do not agree. First, the burden of proof would fall on thefacility to be able to justify why the continued usage of restraint isnecessary during sleeping hours, as on the surface, it would seem thatmost clients, while asleep, would not do damage to self or others. However,some clients may awaken during the night and engage in assaultive or aggressivebehavior. If restraints are used to replace staff shortages or in placeof an active treatment program aimed at eliminating this behavior, thenthe rule forbids the practice. For those very small numbers of clients,whose behavior might warrant the use of a restraint during the night, theprovisions pertaining to motion and exercise apply. Opportunity for motionand exercise for those clients, who wear physical restraints that limittheir free movement, is necessary to maintain blood circulation and toensure that clients do not become stiff or lose any range of motion. Thus,we have kept the proposed requirement, since a restraint can cause lossof range of motion to occur whether the person is awake or asleep. However,if a restraint is worn to deprive a client of access to a portion or portionsof his or her body, and does not restrict range of motion, then exerciseof the ``restrained'' area would not be needed. <T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters objected to the proposed rule at andSection;442.456(i) because it would allow a client to be placed in a totally encloseddevice. Commenters suggested that if we allowed this practice, it wouldappear that we condone ``putting a person in a cage'', which would be demeaningand dehumanizing for the client, and potentially pose a fire hazard.Response: We agree that the practice of putting an individual in a barredor totally enclosed device is very restrictive, and presents special firesafety problems. Therefore, we have deleted the provision proposed at andSection;442.456(i) regarding totally enclosed cribs. Also, it should be noted,that we have retained in the final regulations at andSection; 483.450(d)(7)the provisions proposed at andSection; 442.456(j) which prohibit the useof barred enclosures that have tops. <T3>Comment: </T3>Twenty-seven commenters objected to the proposed regulationsat andSection; 442.452(d) because they would allow staff to place a clientunobserved in a room or other area from which egress is prevented as partof systematic time-out program that meets all applicable standards. Commentersexpressed concern that the proposed rule would allow facilities to use``seclusion'' inappropriately, since it does not identify the ``applicablestandards'' that must be met for the practice to constitute a proper useof time out. The commenters recommended that the regulations clarify thatfor ``seclusion'' to constitute a proper use of time out, it must be aprocedure in which the client, due to inappropriate behavior, is removedfrom a situation that positively reinforces that behavior, in order todecrease the frequency of the behavior. Commenters also suggested thatwe use the language of the corresponding ACDD standard pertaining to theuse of time-out rooms, to distinguish the use of ``time out'', from thepractice of ``seclusion''.Response: Our intent was to adopt the criteria used by the ACDD in addressingthe issues pertaining to the use of time-out and seclusion since its criteriaare widely accepted as reasonable standards. However, the comments indicatethat we need to use clearer language in our attempt to adopt the criteriaused by the ACDD to distinguish ``seclusion'' from ``time-out''. Therefore,in this final rule at andSection; 483.450(c), we have consolidated in onestandard all the requirements that must be met for a time-out activityto qualify as an acceptable procedure, and have used revised language toclarify our meaning. <T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters were evenly divided in their opinions regardingwhether or not the requirements pertaining to the use of time out, whichwere proposed at andSection;andSection; 442.452(d), 442.454(b), and 442.454(e)(1) and (2), should apply to all time-out procedures, or only to thosewhich use ``devices'' as part of the time out. Response: The intent of the proposed rule was to prohibit seclusion, andto regulate the use of devices that are employed as part of a time-outprocedure. As discussed, due to the volume of comments, we have reorganizedthe proposed rule and have included in this final rule a separate standardat andSection; 483.450(c) that specifies the requirements that must be metin using time-out rooms. In addition to rooms, physical restraints arealso devices that can be used for the purpose of providing time out. Physicalrestraints, including those that are used for purposes of time out, mustmeet the pertinent requirements in the standard concerning physical restraintslocated at andSection; 483.450(d) of this final rule.<T3>Comment: </T3>Opinions were expressed that were evenly divided concerningwhether or not locks should be allowed on time-out rooms. Fifteen favoredthe use of locks, and fourteen were opposed. In addition, twenty-sevencommenters stated that they could not support the proposal on the use oftime-out rooms unless it included basic safeguards regarding the supervisionand observation of clients, time limitations, training of staff, and roomsafety. Response: We agree with the last group of commenters. Therefore, this finalrule specifies the following: (1) A client may be placed in a time-outroom only if placement is part of an approved program aimed at eliminatingthe behavior for which time out is employed; (2) emergency placement ina time-out room must not occur; (3) the client in a time-out room mustbe under the direct, constant, visual supervision of staff; (4) the doorto the room must require constant physical pressure by staff to remainclosed; (5) placement must not exceed one hour; and (6) clients must beprotected from hazardous conditions while placed in time-out rooms. Thefinal rule also includes other requirements (such as, the need for informedconsent, outside committee approval, trained staff, and documentation onthe effectiveness of previously tried techniques) that apply to the useof time-out rooms, as well as to the use of any restrictive technique.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters objected to the proposed rule at andSection;442.454(d) that would allow a professional staff member, under extraordinarycircumstances, to approve placing a client in a time-out room for longerthan one hour. Commenters expressed concern because they believe the term``extraordinary circumstances'' is too vague to be used as a standard toregulate technique that is so intrusive to personal liberties. Also, theybelieve that being placed in a time-out room for longer than an hour woulddo no more for the client than serve as a punishment. Response: One hour can be a very long period of time for a client to bekept in a time-out room and to be removed from positive reinforcement.We have found that most clients leave time-out rooms within a very shortperiod of time after being placed there (usually within five to fifteenminutes) although some remain for much longer periods of time, usuallyon average around 45 to 60 minutes. Allowing time intervals beyond an hour,we agree invites potential for abuse. Therefore, in this final rule, wehave deleted the provision that would have allowed a professional staffmember to approve, in extraordinary instances, the use of time out forlonger than an hour.<T3>Comment:</T3> Some commenters objected to the requirement proposedat andSection;422.458(b) that drugs used for behavior management must beused only as an integral part of the client's IPP which is directed towardthe reduction of, and eventual elimination of, the behaviors for whichthe drugs are employed. Commenters stated that this requirement is tooidealistic because there are some individuals whose inappropriate behaviorwill never be totally eliminated and who will always need the support ofdrugs at a maintenance level. They suggested that the rule include separaterequirements for those clients who are prescribed drugs for psychiatricdisorders.Response: We disagree. Our concern is that there must be an aggressiveprogram to reduce and eliminate the behaviors for which the drugs are employed,regardless of the source or the nature of the diagnosis that is the basisfor prescribing psychoactive medications. Thus, the facility must examineall the factors that might relate to the client's need for drugs. Thisincludes the client's behavior, the staff's conduct toward the client,the family, the environment, and other factors that might influence theclient's need for drugs, as well as the diagnosis and the medication regimen.Based on an evaluation of these factors, an active treatment program aimedat the acquisition of appropriate behavior by the client, and the eventualelimination of the need for drugs must be pursued within the context ofa team process that draws on the expertise of all of its members, includingthat of the physician.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters objected to our proposed standardat andSection;442.458 on drug usage, because in their opinion it did notadequately address issues pertaining to the need to obtain informed consentfrom the client regarding the use of drugs. Also, they believed that thestandard did not adequately deal with issues pertaining to the prescription,monitoring, and review of psychotropic medications. Commenters stated thatthe misuse, and the inadequate monitoring and evaluation of psychotropicmedications in mental retardation facilities has been well known and documentedfor years. They referred to a report from the American Psychiatric Association(APA) that medication to control inappropriate behavior may be prescribedfor as many as 55 percent of those with developmental disabilities, despiteresearch evidence that seriously questions the effectiveness of these drugsin treating behavioral disorders. They stated that the APA report indicatesthat physicians usually do not adequately evaluate the effectiveness ofthe medications, prescribe them for too long a period of time, and do notmonitor their side effects or interactions with other medications.Response: The purpose for this proposed standard was to prohibit the uninformed,misguided use of chemical agents to suppress and manipulate client behavior.Although guidance and information are available from psychopharmacologists,psychologists, and other professionals, on how to use medications in afacilitative rather than in an oppressive way, facilities have been slowto consult with these individuals in determining how best to utilize drugsfor their clients. Therefore, to strengthen this standard in the finalrule, we have included several additional provisions to safeguard clientsand control the use of drugs in ICFs/MR.The standard for drug usage in the final rule, at andSection;483.450(e) requiresthe following: (1) That drugs used in the control of inappropriate behaviormust be approved by the interdisciplinary team; (2) that drugs prescribedto control inappropriate behavior must be monitored closely for desiredresponses and adverse consequences by facility staff; (3) that these drugsbe gradually withdrawn at least annually, unless documented clinical evidenceindicates that this is contraindicated because of the client's condition.Additionally, the final rule requires that, before approving the use ofa drug, the interdisciplinary team must document that the harmful effectsof the behavior clearly outweigh the potentially harmful effects of thedrug. Also, in accordance with the final rule at andSection;483.440(f)(3)(ii),informed consent regarding the use of drugs is required from the client,parents (if the client is a minor), or legal guardian.<T3>Comment:</T3> The proposed drug standard would require that a facilitymust not use drugs as punishment, for staff convenience, as a substitutefor active treatment, or in doses that interfere with a client's IPP. Twelvecommenters asked if these regulations would apply to all drugs, or onlydrugs prescribed to modify client behavior. These commenters suggestedthat they should apply only to drugs prescribed for a client's inappropriatebehavior.Response: We do not agree that these provisions should apply only to drugsprescribed to modify behavior. Historically, many types of medicationsused in the care of mentally retarded individuals, including laxativesand anti-convulsants, have been used inappropriately. Therefore, theserequirements apply to all medications.<T3>Comment:</T3> The proposed rule at andSection;442.456(k) would requirethat a physical restraint used as a time-out device must be used only duringbehavior modification exercises. Two commenters requested that we definewhat we mean by ``behavior modification exercises''.Response: The intent of the proposed regulation was to ensure that a restraintused as a time-out device (like any other time-out device) would be usedas part of a formal training or behavior shaping program and to prohibitthe emergency use of time-out devices.To clarify what we meant by ``behavior modification exercises'', the finalrule at andSection;483.450(d)(1) states that a facility may employ physicalrestraints only as an integral part of an IPP.<T3>Comment:</T3> Seven commenters requested clarification of the proposedrequirement at andSection;442.454(e)(2) that restrictive programs to manageinappropriate client behavior cannot be implemented until written consentof the client or his or her parents or legal guardian, if available, hasbeen obtained. Commenters expressed concern about obtaining informed writtenconsent from minor clients, who do not have parents, or adults who areclearly incompetent, but do not have a legal guardian assigned becausethey have not yet completed formal adjudication procedures. These commenterssuggested that for these clients, the outside committee required by theproposed rule at andSection;442.450(e), or the State's protection and advocacyagency should be responsible for providing consent to the use of restrictiveprocedures.Response: It was our intent to require consent, if available, for the useof aversive techniques from either the client, or his or her ``parents''(if the client is a minor), or a ``legal guardian''. Ordinarily, it isone of these three persons who can act in a client's behalf unless someoneelse had been designated to do so by the State. Thus, by listing thesethree persons, we did not intend to limit the State's authority to designatesomeone else to represent the client. Also, we are aware that in some instancesa client's legal status may not yet have been adjudicated, even thoughthe client is not able to give informed consent. That is why the proposedrule stipulated that consent was required, ``if available''. Nevertheless,we believe that the use of the phrase, ``if available'', has only confusedthe meaning of this requirement. Therefore, it has been deleted. For thoseclients who are minors, or who are clearly incompetent but have no appointedlegal guardian, interpretive guidelines will explain that written consentfor these clients should be obtained from someone designated by the Stateto represent the client. However, in many cases, a facility would serveas an advocate for these clients by trying to facilitate the timely adjudicationof their legal status.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters submitted additional opinions on theproposed requirement, at andSection;442.454(e)(2), that would prohibit restrictiveprograms from being implemented until consent was given. Some objectedto requiring that consent be obtained only if it is available. They feltthat this requirement was so vague that it would allow a facility to implementan intrusive program without making a sufficient effort to obtain consent.For example, if a guardian was not ``available'' to give consent by phone,a facility might not make any additional efforts to obtain consent. Also,a few commenters felt that a legally competent adult would never consentto receiving aversive conditioning. Others believed that it was unreasonablefor us to require for incompetent clients, who do not have a legal guardianbecause their status had not been adjudicated, that legal guardianshipmust be established in order to obtain required consent. One commenterrequested us to state explicitly in the final rule, that failure by a clientto give consent to a restrictive program, would not be grounds for dischargefrom the facility.Response: As discussed in the previous response, we have deleted from therule the phrase, ``as available'', because of the confusion it had caused.Also, the final rule does not require that legal guardianship be establishedfor an adult client, or a minor child without parents, who is unable togive informed consent, but whose legal status has not yet been adjudicated.In those cases, we believe it is sufficient for someone designated by theState as the client's representative, to approve the use of intrusive treatmentuntil the client's status has been adjudicated and a guardian appointed.Also, we know that clients are not only able to, but do in fact, give informedconsent for intrusive programs to be conducted. However, we believe thatthe more salient issue is whether or not refusal to give consent for arestrictive procedure would be automatic grounds for discharge from thefacility. When a client refuses to give consent to an aversive procedure,the facility must first review its documentation to ensure that all techniquesthat are more positive or less intrusive have been tried and demonstratedto be ineffective. If all less intrusive techniques have been proven tobe ineffective, then the facility must decide how, if at all, it can continueto meet the active treatment needs of the client. If a facility believesthat it cannot meet the active treatment needs of the client, unless itprovides the intrusive technique for which consent has been refused, thiscould constitute grounds for discharge. However, should the client wantto contest the discharge, he or she has the right to pursue legal redress.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that the proposed rule at andSection;442.454(e)(2), which would allow restrictive programs to be conducted onlywith written consent, be amended to require ``informed'' written consent.Response: It was our intent to require informed consent. However, to ensurethat this is clearly understood, the final rule at andSection; 483.440(f)(3)(ii)specifically states that informed written consent is required.<T3>Comment:</T3> Four commenters suggested that we mandate that physiciansand behavior management specialists must participate on the interdisciplinaryteams of those clients who need programs to change inappropriate behavior.Commenters stated that this is necessary, because the development of effectiveprograms to manage inappropriate client behavior, which may necessitateaddressing such problems as drug usage and determining whether organicityis the cause of the client's behavior, should only be done by qualifiedand experienced personnel.Response: We appreciate the intent of the commenters. We believe the proposedrequirement at andSection; 442.444(a) would ensure adequately that thoseprofessionals who are needed to develop effective programs, would participateon each client's team. However, to further clarify our intent, the languageof the final rule at andSection; 483.440(c)(1) requires that a client's interdisciplinaryteam must represent those professions and disciplines relevant to eachclient's needs as identified in the client's comprehensive assessment,and to the design of programs to meet the client's needs. Moreover, wedo not agree that it is necessary for those professionals named by thecommenters to participate on the team of every client who needs a programto manage inappropriate behavior. Whether or not these professionals areneeded will depend on the particular behavior management needs of the client.Also, participation on the team may vary at times contingent upon whetherthe task the team is completing pertains to the design, implementationor review of the client's IPP.<T3>Comment:</T3> Five commenters were concerned that we did not requirestaff who implement restrictive programs to be trained. A few of thesecommenters specifically stressed the importance of requiring training forstaff who implement restraint programs.Response: It was our belief that this issue was addressed by the proposedprovisions at andSection; 442.430(c), which would mandate that staff mustbe able to demonstrate the skills and techniques necessary to implementthe IPPs for each client under their care, and the proposed provisionsat andSection; 442.456(e) which would require that staff applying restraintsmust be trained in their use. However, we have concluded that it was necessaryto add a provision in the final rule at andSection; 483.430(e)(3) to requirestaff training on all techniques to manage inappropriate behavior, as well.<T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters recommended that the regulation requirethat baseline data be kept on all programs which are for the purpose ofmanaging inappropriate client behavior, so that the pattern and frequencyof such behavior can be assessed.Response: We agree that such data should be kept. The facility is requiredby the final regulations at andSection; 483.450(b)(1)(iii) to demonstratethe ineffectiveness of all previously tried behavior shaping techniquesprior to the use of more restrictive techniques. Therefore, it is alreadyimplicitly required that baseline data must be maintained. The facilitywould not be able to evaluate, without baseline data, the effectivenessof previously tried programs and techniques to manage inappropriate behavior.Furthermore, andSection; 483.440(e) of the final rule requires that datapertaining to the accomplishment of criteria specified in IPP objectivesmust be documented in measurable terms.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter requested that we specify how often programsdesigned to manage inappropriate client behavior must be reviewed for effectiveness.This commenter believes that since we have deleted the existing requirementthat client IPPs be reviewed monthly, we no longer have a mechanism toensure that restrictive and intrusive programs will be reviewed and revisedas often as needed.Response: We appreciate the commenters' concern, but believe it would beto prescriptive to specify how often these programs must be reviewed. Inaccordance with the final rule, a client's IPP (including any IPP objectivetargeted to eliminate maladaptive behavior) must be revised as needed.We believe that the facility should develop its own process for ensuringthat this is accomplished effectively.<T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters suggested that we should not require facilitiesto describe in a client's IPP all the methods that are used to manage inappropriateclient behavior, such as the application of ``house rules'' or ``standardcontingencies'' that apply to all clients in a residence.Response: We do not agree. In applying ``house rules'' or ``standard contingencies,''which pertain to <T3>all</T3> clients in a residence, the facility must still take intoaccount the individual needs of each client, and ensure that if any contingenciesresult in the abrogation of client rights or protections, that this doesnot amount to neglect or abuse. All the objectives for which the clientis being trained must be included in the IPP. If it is in a client's bestinterest to participate in a program, in which contingencies are appliedbased on the client's behavior, then there should be a corresponding behavioralobjective in the client's IPP, so that the effects of the program on theclient, and the use of the contingencies, can be evaluated by the team.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter recommended that the proposed requirementat andSection; 442.444(d)(6), that an IPP must include the written strategieswhich are to be used to reach the objectives, should be waived for thoseobjectives that are designed to eliminate maladaptive behaviors. The commenterstated that these written strategies are usually very long (two to sixpages). Therefore, if they are included as part of the IPP, they wouldmake the document too bulky.Response: As discussed earlier in this preamble, the proposed rule hasbeen revised and the final regulations at andSection; 483.440(c)(6)(ii) nolonger require that the IPP include the strategies to be used, but onlythat it identify the location where program strategy information can befound.<T3>Comment:</T3> A few commenters recommended that we require each facilityto have a ``behavior management'' review committee in addition to the speciallyconstituted committee required by the proposed rule at andSection; 442.450(e).These commenters felt that the rule should require each facility to establisha separate committee consisting of members with expertise in behavior managementin order to ensure that proposed restrictive and aversive programs weretechnically appropriate, and that a client's rights were not abridged.Response: We appreciate the concern of the commenters, but we believe thatit would be too prescriptive to require the establishment of another committeein addition to the one required by the final rule at andSection; 483.440(f)(3).However, as mentioned before, we have included in the final rule at andSection;483.440(f)(3) that a qualified person or persons who have either experienceor training in contemporary practices to change inappropriate client behaviormust be on the outside committee.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed confusion about the meaning ofthe term ``punishment'', as used in the proposed rule at andSection; 442.458(a)that would prohibit the use of drugs as a punishment. The commenter couldnot determine if our intent was to use it in a generic sense, to mean ``discipline'',or to use it as it is clinically defined.Response: The word ``punishment'', as used for example, in the proposedrule concerning physical restraints and drug use at andSection;andSection;442.456(g) and 442.458(a), respectively, means the application of veryintrusive measures (such as physical restraints) in order to ``discipline''a client. To clarify our intent, we have referred to ``disciplinary purposes''in the final rule at andSection; 483.450(b)(3), instead of punishment.<T3>Comment:</T3> A few commenters felt that the proposed requirement atandSection; 442.452(c), which would prohibit staff from using corporal punishment,or verbal, physical, or sexual abuse, would have been given greater importanceif it was relocated to the standard concerning staff treatment of clientsat andSection;442.424.Response: We agree. We have made revisions so that the standard for stafftreatment of clients in the final rule at andSection;483.420(d) now includesthe provisions on the mistreatment of clients that were originally proposedat andSection; 442.452(c).<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter recommended that we require facilitiesto have special procedures to review their behavior management programsthat result in contingencies that may abridge clients' rights or protections.Response: We do not agree that this is necessary. The outside committee,which is required by the final rule at 483.440(f)(3), already has the responsibilityof ensuring that client rights are protected.Y. Professional Program Services (Proposed andSection; 442.460; Final andSection;483.430(b))<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters criticized the proposed requirementsat andSection; 442.460 (e)(1) through (e)(9), regarding professional qualifications.These commenters stated that our emphasis on ``credentials'', such as requirementspertaining to academic degrees, work experience, or membership in professionalassociations, did not guarantee provision of quality services, and wasextremely prescriptive and inconsistent with our stated intent to developoutcome-oriented standards. They suggested instead that work performanceshould be stressed. They also stated that if employment credentials wererequired for certain positions, that they should be the same as those specifiedin State licensure and certification standards. Others recommended thatState licensure requirements should be waived for those unlicensed professionaland paraprofessional staff who work under the direct supervision of licensedprofessional personnel.Response: One of the most important requirements in the ICF/MR regulationis that each client's active treatment program must be developed and implementedby qualified staff. However, we agree that requiring staff, who meet Statelicensure requirements, to meet additional qualifications, is too ``process''oriented. Therefore, we have amended the proposed rule so that only staffwho do not fall under the jurisdiction of State licensure or certificationrequirements must meet the professional qualifications listed in the finalregulation at andSection; 483.430(b). Moreover, if there is no conflict withState licensure and certification requirements, we will now allow facilitiesto utilize professionals who do not meet the qualifications specified inthe final rule at andSection; 483.430(b)(5)(i) through (5)(x), if it canbe demonstrated that clients' IPPs are being successfully implemented.Regardless, there must be a foundation of knowledge that can be drawn uponin the facility, and we believe that setting qualifications for professionalshelps to ensure (but does not guarantee) that needed knowledge is available.Also, we have consolidated into a single requirement, at andSection; 483.430(b)of the final rule, the various references in the proposed rule to the standardthat professional staff must be licensed, certified, or registered if requiredby State law. It is important to note that the final regulations do notspecify qualifications for positions, but rather set qualifications forthose who are referred to as ``professional'' staff.<T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters stated that the educational qualificationsrequired by the proposed rule at andSection; 442.460(e)(6) would decreasethe number of social workers eligible to provide professional servicesin ICFs/MR. Commenters suggested that we either retain the requirementsof the current rule, or include a ``grandfather'' clause to allow thosewho meet the existing requirements to continue in their present positions.Response: We disagree. Under the final rule, for a person to be designatedas a ``social worker'', the person must meet the qualification requirementsat andSection; 483.430(b)(5)(vi), or be licensed or certified as a socialworker by the State. However, while a person who is not qualified as asocial worker may not be referred to as a social worker per se; nevertheless,such a person may be able to provide social services in an ICF/MR if thereis no conflict with State law and as long as the clients' needs are beingmet. The final rule at andSection; 483.430(b)(5)(xi) allows facilities toutilize staff to provide professional services who do not meet the qualificationsspecified at andSection; 483.430(b) (5)(i) through (5)(x), if it can be demonstratedthat clients' IPPs are being successfully implemented. Furthermore, theproposed rule does not raise the standards that must be met by those whofunction as qualified mental retardation professionals. In accordance withthe existing regulations, those individuals who have a bachelor's degreein a human services field, and who have three years of experience workingunder the supervision of a social worker, can function as qualified mentalretardation professionals. Under the new rule, these persons can stillfunction as qualified mental retardation professionals, because the finalrule at andSection; 483.430(a) does not require qualified mental retardationprofessionals to meet one of the standards at andSection; 483.430(b) (5)(i)through (x), which apply to specific categories of professional programstaff, since staff who meet the requirements at paragraph (5)(x) of thesection may also qualify as qualified mental retardation professionals.<T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters criticized the proposed required qualificationsfor professional program staff, at andSection; 442.460(e), as being too lax.Commenters stated that, generally, graduates from most professional educationalprograms have no training or experience in working with persons with mentalretardation or developmental disabilities. Therefore, they suggested thatall professional program staff should be required to have the equivalentof one year of either completing coursework pertaining to mental retardationor other developmental disabilities, or working directly with the ICF/MRpopulation.Response: We disagree. We believe the commenters' suggestion pertainingto required coursework and work experience is too prescriptive, and wouldinterfere with a facility's ability to recruit qualified professional staff.We agree that many professional training programs do not include distinctcoursework on the nature of mental retardation or developmental disabilities,and many graduates from these programs have no experience working withthis population. However, we believe that most professional educationalprograms in the field of human services, provide training that can be adaptedby graduates to enable them to work effectively, as professionals, in ICFs/MR.Therefore, since the commenters' suggested change would not allow facilitiesto hire these individuals for professional positions, we have not includedit in the final rule. Nevertheless, we believe that a facility should recruitand hire the most experienced and knowledgeable professional staff thatit can. Also, in connection with this comment, under the final regulationat andSection; 483.430, a facility must provide each employee with initialand continuing training that enables the employee to perform his or herduties effectively, efficiently, and competently.<T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters criticized the proposed qualificationsat andSection; 442.460(e) because, in some instances, a professional wasrequired only to ``be eligible for'' certification, rather than be certifiedor registered by the applicable professional association. These commentersstated that this standard was too lenient, and that the regulation shouldrequire that these professionals be certified within a specified periodof time.Response: For the regulations to require that staff must be certified witha particular professional association, rather than to require them to beeligible for certification, would mean that HCFA was mandating that certainICF/MR staff must be members of or affiliated with specific professionalassociations. We do not believe that it would be appropriate for HCFA toinclude such a requirement in the regulation.<T3>Comment: </T3>Some commenters found the proposed requirements at andSection;442.450 that specify the experience qualifications of a qualified mentalretardation professional and at andSection; 442.460 that state the academicrequirements for a qualified mental retardation professional, to be duplicativeand unclear. A few commenters suggested that we identify the titles ofthose professional positions which may qualify a person to be a qualifiedmental retardation professional, and specify the required credentials forthese positions. Other commenters suggested that all provisions relatingto the qualifications of qualified mental retardation professionals, locatedin the proposed andSection; 442.450, should be relocated to andSection; 442.460.Response: We do not agree that the changes suggested would improve thereadability or clarity of the regulations. We believe that the rule, withoutthe suggested changes, clearly identifies the professional requirementsthat must be met for a person to qualify as a qualified mental retardationprofessional. These requirements are contained in the final regulationsat andSection; 483.430(a).<T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters questioned the need of establishingrequired job qualifications for some paraprofessional positions (that is,occupational therapy assistants and physical therapy assistants), whilenot including required qualifications for others, such as teacher assistantsand recreation assistants. These commenters suggested that to be consistent,we should either establish required qualifications for all paraprofessionalpositions, or for none of them.Response: Qualifications were included in the proposed regulations foroccupational and physical therapy assistants because national standardsexist for these two positions that have been established by their nationalassociations. We have not included teacher assistant standards becausewe do not believe that there are national employment standards establishedfor the position of teacher assistant, or for any other paraprofessionalposition that is frequently employed in ICFs/MR. It should be noted, however,that if these ``assistants'' have less than a bachelor's degree, they cannotserve as qualified mental retardation professionals.<T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters, including the applicable national professionalassociation, criticized the proposed professional standards for occupationaltherapists at andSection; 442.460(e)(1), and occupational therapy assistantsat andSection; 442.460(e)(2) that would require that individuals in thesepositions be eligible for certification by their national association,or a graduate of a program accredited by that association. The commentersasserted that these two requirements are redundant, since a graduate ofa program accredited by the American Occupational Therapy Association,would also be eligible for certification by that association. Therefore,the commenters suggested that we delete the proposed provisions requiringgraduation from an accredited program.Response: We agree. The proposed provisions requiring graduation from anaccredited program have not been included in this final rule.<T3>Comment: </T3>The proposed professional qualifications at andSection;442.460(e)(5), that would require that a person must have at least a master'sdegree in psychology in order to be designated as a psychologist, elicitedwidely varying comments. Suggestions for changes included various combinationsof requirements regarding the type of degree, the credentials of the personwho supervises the psychologist, and the number of years of experiencenecessary to be ``qualified.'' For example, one commenter stated that aperson with a bachelor's degree in psychology should be allowed to practiceas a psychologist if his work is supervised by a psychologist with a master'sor doctoral degree. Another commenter suggested that to be consistent withother Federal programs (such as the Civilian Health and Medical Programof the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), Social Security Disability Insurance(SSDI), and the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program) only Ph.D. levelpsychologists should be considered qualified to provide psychological servicesto clients of ICFs/MR.Response: Licensure or certification requirements in most States requirepsychologists to have at least a master's degree in order to provide professionalservices. Requiring psychologists to have at least a master's degree toqualify to provide psychological services is a widely accepted standard.Thus, in those States where there are no applicable State licensure requirements,we believe it is appropriate to require a master's degree as a minimumqualification for a person to be designated as a psychologist.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter pointed out that the proposed regulationat andSection; 442.460(e)(5), which would require a psychologist to havea master's degree from an accredited program, is not an appropriate requirementbecause the American Psychological Association accredits only doctorallevel programs. The commenter suggested that we delete the word ``program''and substitute the word ``school''.Response: We agree. In the final rule at andSection; 483.430(b)(5)(v) wenow use the word ``school'' rather than the word ``program''.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter criticized the proposed rule at andSection;442.460(e)(6)(iii) because it would allow a person with a bachelor's degreein social work to practice as a professional social worker. The commenterbelieves a master's degree should be required.Response: We disagree. Technically, a person with a bachelor's degree mightnot be as qualified to provide social services, as a person with a master'sdegree. However, the Council on Social Work Education accredits professionaltraining programs at the bachelor's degree level. Therefore, we do notbelieve it is necessary to stipulate standards in excess of that.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters recommended that we amend the proposedrule at andSection;442.460(e)(7)(i) requiring that speech and language pathologistsor audiologists must be eligible for certification by the American Speech,Language, and Hearing Association (ASHA), in accordance with the requirementsthat the Association has in effect at the time of this rule's publication.Commenters stated that by using the proposed language, the regulation wouldbe out-of-date as soon as ASHA's requirements changed. They suggested thatthis would be avoided if the rule referred to ASHA's ``current requirements'',instead.  Response: We agree with the commenters' recommendation and have deletedthe reference to the time of publication of the regulation (see andSection;483.430(b)(5)(vii)of the final rule). We have not, however, made a specific reference to``current requirements''. HCFA keeps abreast of changes that are made tothe professional standards of organizations and will amend this regulationas appropriate.  <T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters objected to the proposed languageat andSection;442.460(e)(8) that would allow an individual to qualify asa professional recreation staff member by having a degree either in recreationor in a specialty area such as art, dance, music, physical education, orrecreation therapy. Commenters stated that an individual with a degreein recreation receives much less training and experience in working withthe disabled population than individuals who have a degree in one of thecreative art specialty areas named in the proposed rule. Therefore, becauseof the distinct differences in the training and experience they receive,the commenters recommended that the qualification standards for professionalrecreation staff members should be completely separate from those thatapply to individuals training in one of the creative art specialty areas.Some commenters also objected to the proposed language at andSection;442.460(e)(8)because it would allow a person with a fine arts degree in music, art,or dance to qualify as a professional staff member in an ICF/MR, even thoughthe individual may not have had training in how to work with special populations.Therefore, they suggested that the regulation specifically require thatindividuals trained in music, art, or dance must have degrees in musictherapy, art therapy, or dance therapy, to qualify as professional staffmembers.Response: We have retained the proposed language in these final regulations.We believe that the thrust of the comments is that, within the universeof individuals appropriate to serve as recreation staff, distinctions canbe drawn based on education and training. None of the commenters suggestedthat the universe of individuals covered under the language of the proposalwould not be suitable as recreation staff. Since our objective in theseregulations is to provide flexibility to the extent feasible, we see nouseful purpose in drawing additional distinctions within the universe.We expect that ICFs/MR will employ those individuals necessary to achievethe desired outcomes.  <T3>Comment:</T3> Some commenters criticized the proposed rule at andSection;442.460(e)(8)because it would require professional recreation staff members to havea bachelor's degree. These commenters stated that this was too strict arequirement and would decrease the number of people who could qualify forthis position. They suggested that we either retain the qualification requirementsfor recreation staff members contained in existing regulations, or thatwe include a ``grandfather'' provision to allow those who occupy this positioncurrently, to continue to do so under final regulations.  Response: Under current regulations at section andSection;442.493(b), a personwith sufficient experience and proficiency may qualify to conduct the recreationprogram for an ICF/MR, even though the person does not have a bachelor'sdegree in recreation. Under this final rule, these persons may still qualifyto perform this function, because the rule at andSection;483.430(b)(5)(xi)does not require that a person has to be designated as a professional recreationstaff member to provide these services to clients. Nevertheless, if theyare not licensed or certified in their State, these persons would not beable to call themselves ``professional recreastion staff'' members unlessthey have a bachelor's degree in recreation. However, we do not believethat ``grandfathering'' is necessary, because the new rule, and the existingrule, allow individuals who have sufficient experience and proficiencyto conduct recreation programs for ICFs/MR.  <T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters expressed concern that since the professionalqualifications for dietitians were included in the proposed standard forfacility staffing, at andSection;442.426(f) instead of in the proposed standardfor professional program services, at andSection;442.460, dietitians wouldnot qualify as qualified mental retardation professionals. This would happenbecause the proposed rule at andSection;442.450(a)(3)(iii) would includeindividuals who hold a bachelor's degree in a professional category listedat andSection;442.460 among those who qualify to be qualified mental retardationprofessionals. Therefore, they suggested that we relocate the qualificationsfor dietitians to the standard on professional program services, at andSection;442.460. Response: We agree and have transferred the provisions of the regulationregarding the required qualifications for professional dietitians to thestandard for professional program services contained in final regulationsat andSection;483.430(b)(5)(ix).  <T3>Comment:</T3> Twenty commenters criticized the proposed rule at andSection;442.460(e)(9)because it would not allow persons with a bachelor's degree in psychologyto function as human services professionals. The proposed rule at andSection;442.460(e)(9)states that a human services professional must be a person with at leasta bachelor's degree in a human services field, other than those mentionedin andSection;442.460(e)(1) through (e)(8) of this section. The proposedandSection;442.460(e)(5) specifically mentioned psychology and would requirethat a psychologist have a master's degree. The commenters objected becausethey believe that a person with a bachelor's degree in psychology wouldbe as qualified to be a human services professional as a person with abachelor's degree in any of the disciplines mentioned at proposed andSection;442.460(e)(9),such as sociology, special education, rehabilitation counseling. Therefore,the commenters suggested that the rule be amended to allow individualswith a bachelor's degree in psychology to qualify as human services professionals,since psychology provides detailed training in principles directly relatedto active treatment and human behavior.  Response: We agree and have modified the proposed rule. The amendment iscontained in the final rule at andSection;483.430(b)(5)(x). As discussedearlier in the preamble, the purpose for including in the regulation ahuman services professional category was to expand the number and typesof persons who could qualify as qualified mental retardation professionals,while still maintaining acceptable professional standards. However, ourintention also was to clarify that a person who qualifies as a ``humanservices professional'' does not necessarily meet the qualifications necessaryto practice as a psychologist, social worker, etc. To further clarify ourintent, we have revised the proposed rule to include the language suggestedby one commenter. This revision is reflected in andSection;483.430(b)(5)of the final rule. Normally, for each specific professional disciplinelisted in andSection;483.430(b)(5)(i) through (5)(x), we have added the phrase,``To be designated as . . .''. This phrase means that to function as apsychologist, social worker, etc., one must meet certain qualificationsthat are more specific than those that must be met to function as a ``humanservices professional''.  <T3>Comment:</T3> Some commenters criticized the propose rule for not specifyingwhat qualifications must be met by professionals in the fields of specialeducation and rehabilitation counseling. The commenters objected becausethey believe that a degree in these two fields of study requires more specializedtraining in mental retardation and developmental disabilities, than isrequired for a degree in the other disciplines for which the rule doeslist required professional qualifications. These commenters submitted suggestedlanguage to include in the final rule, as distinct and separate requirements,the qualification standards for these two disciplines.  Response: We disagree. The particular professions for which required qualificationswere proposed at andSection;442.460, are the professions most commonly employedby ICFs/MR. Special education teachers and rehabilitation counselors areemployed mostly by other types of programs such as special school districtswhich are not part of the ICF/MR, rather than by ICFs/MR. Also, it wouldnot be practical to specify in the regulations, the required qualificationsfor every type of professional position found in an ICF/MR. However, toacknowledge the very specialized training in developmental disabilitiesthat is required for a degeee in special education or rehabilitation counseling,we have specifically identified in the final rule at andSection;483.430(b)(5)(x)these disciplines as examples of academic degrees that could qualify aperson as a human services professional.  <T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters objected to the proposed rule at andSection;442.460(e)(9)because it mentions only sociology, special education, and rehabilitationcounseling, as types of degrees that would qualify a person to be a humanservices professional. These commenters interpreted the proposed rule tomean that a person would have to have a degree in one of these three fieldsto qualify as a human services professional.Response: Our intent, at proposed andSection; 442.460(e)(9), was to giveexamples of acceptable human services degrees. To clarify that the threedisciplines listed are intended only as examples and not as a completelist, we use in the final rule at andSection; 483.430(b)(5)(x) the phrase``including, but not limited to''. <T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters inquired whether or not, under the proposedrule, a professional staff member, who met the proposed requirements atandSection; 442.460(e)(9), but did not meet State licensure requirements,could qualify as a human services professional. Response: We do not believe that there are any applicable State licensureor certification requirements that must be met to be designated as a humanservices professional. Thus, in accordance with the final rule at andSection;483.430(b)(5)(x), anyone with a bachelors degree in a human services fieldcan qualify as a human services professional. If that person has at leastone year's experience working directly with mentally retarded or developmentallydisabled individuals, then he or she could also qualify as a qualifiedmental retardation professional. <T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters criticized the human services professionalcategory proposed at andSection; 442.460(e)(9) because in their opinion thelanguage was too vague and thus, subject to misinterpretation by providersand surveyors. They suggested that we define the term ``human servicesfield''; identify all the human service degrees that are acceptable; or,include in the meaning of human services, any discipline related to thetype of services provided in ICFs/MR. Response: We do not believe it would be practical to attempt to cataloguein regulations all the human service degrees that are acceptable. Also,in some instances, in taking into consideration a facility's needs andthe type of training and coursework that a person has completed, it willbe necessary for the facility and the surveyors to exercise judgment todetermine what constitutes an acceptable human services degree. The final rule also contains the provision at andSection; 483.430(b)(5)(xi),which allows a facility, if it is able to implement clients' IPPs successfully,to use professional program staff, including human service professionals,who do not meet the qualifications stipulated in the regulation, as longas there is compliance with State licensure requirements. We also have modified andSection; 483.430(b)(5)(xi), which excuses providersfrom personnel qualification requirements under certain circumstances,to make it clear that it does not apply to the provision at andSection; 483.430(b)(2)requiring enough staff to carry out the interventions necessary to achievethe objectives and goals of the IPP. <T3>Comment: </T3>Additional commenters expressed various opinions aboutthe proposed required qualifications at andSection; 442.460(e)(9) for thehuman services professional category. Opinions ranged from statements thatwe were ``too strict'', to those that we were ``too lax''. For example,one commenter stated that the educational requirements should be deletedand replaced by some measurement of ability based on an examination. Anothercommenter stated that requiring a bachelor's degree in any field, plusthree years of work experience in the field of developmental disabilities,would be more acceptable than the proposed standard. One commenter suggestedthat we delete the entire proposed category, because its inclusion in therule decreased the level of professionalism required of program staff inICFs/MR. Response: The proposed qualifications for the human services professionalcategory generated a wide variety of comments. However, the majority ofthe commenters supported retaining this category in the regulation. Thus,we have decided to retain a separate human services professional categoryin the final rule at andSection; 483.430(b)(5)(x), including the revisionsto this category that were previously discussed in the preamble.<T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters stated that because of the proposedqualifications for professional personnel at andSection; 442.460 (e)(1) through(e)(9), some professional staff members in ICFs/MR who are currently ableto qualify as qualified mental retardation professionals will no longerbe able to do so. Commenters suggested that we either retain the existingregulation as it applies to qualified mental retardation professionals,or that we establish a ``grandfather'' provision, which would allow anystaff member currently functioning as a qualified mental retardation professionalto continue in that position. Response: We do not believe there are any substantive differences betweenthe requirements contained in existing regulations and those in the proposedrule regarding the qualifications that must be met by a qualified mentalretardation professional. Therefore, we are making no changes and believethat, generally, anyone who is qualified to function as a qualified mentalretardation professional under the existing regulations also would be qualifiedunder the regulations contained in this final rule. <T3>Comment: </T3>Eleven commenters requested clarification about the proposedrule at andSection; 442.460(c) which would require professional program staffto participate as team members in relevant aspects of the active treatmentprocess. Commenters inquired whether ``participation'' could be obtainedthrough written reports and recommendations, or whether the professionalswould be required to be physically present at team meetings. Response: The purpose of the interdisciplinary team process is to provideteam members with the opportunity to review and discuss face-to-face, informationand recommendations relating to the client's needs, and to reach decisionsas a team rather than individually on how to best address those needs.Should a designated member of a particular client's team be unable or unwillingto participate in any meeting, the team should obtain the absent members'input through alternative means. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed concern that facilities wouldnot be able to recognize when there is a need for special professionalinput regarding a particular client, and they would not be sufficientlyknowledgeable about the services available from the various professionaldisciplines. Response: We believe that for a facility to be able to perform adequatelythe comprehensive client assessments that are required by the regulations,its staff would have to be sufficiently knowledgeable about the servicesoffered by the various professional disciplines. Generally, we believethat facilities that are able to assess client needs effectively also areable to assemble the expertise needed to develop and implement an effectiveprogram for their clients. We also believe that our outcome-oriented surveyprotocol identifies those facilities that are unable to perform effectiveassessments. <T3>Comment: </T3>Five commenters were opposed to the proposed rule atandSection; 442.460(a) that would require professionals to work directlywith clients. They interpreted this section of the rule to mean that professionalprogram staff must work directly with all clients on a daily basis. Thesecommenters stated that this would be too costly and that the primary dutyof professional personnel should be to direct the activity of paraprofessionaland nonprofessional staff. Also, the commenters stated that many clientsin ICFs/MR do not need direct professional contact, that often they onlyneed programs that are developed and monitored by professionals, but whichcan be implemented by nonprofessional staff. They suggested that we revisethe proposed rule so that it requires professional staff to work directlywith clients only ``as needed''. Response: We agree that there are clients residing in ICFs/MR who can oftenhave their needs effectively met without having direct contact with professionalprogram staff on a daily basis. The needs of these clients can often bemet by competent nonprofessional staff who are supervised or directed byprofessionals. The intent of the rule is not to require that professionalswork directly with clients on a daily basis, but only as often as a client'sneeds indicate that direct professional contact is necessary. The amountand degree of direct care that professionals must provide will depend onthe needs of the clients and the ability of other staff to train and directclients on a day-to-day basis. However, to have an effective program, professionalsmust evaluate clients, make recommendations, set planned outcomes, developstrategies, implement interventions, train staff, monitor the implementationof strategies, and review the effectiveness of programs. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that staff should not be allowedto provide services or implement interventions unless they are competentto do so, and suggested that this be included as a requirement. Response: We agree. The proposed rule at andSection; 442.430(c) would requirethat anyone providing services to a client should be able to demonstratecompetency. This requirement has been kept in the final rule and is nowcontained in andSection; 483.430(e). <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that we specify the minimum professionalstaff-to-client ratios that must be met by a facility to ensure that itsprofessional services are being adequately provided. Response: We believe requiring specific professional staff to client ratioswould be overly prescriptive. What constitutes an acceptable professionalstaff-to-client ratio in a particular facility is determined by the needsof its individual clients. A facility must evaluate each of its clients, and then determine how manyprofessional staff are necessary to provide the direct and indirect servicesrequired in order to meet their needs adequately.<T3>Z. Physician Services (Proposed andSection;442.462, Final andSection;483.460) </T3><T3>Comment: </T3>Nine commenters objected to the proposed regulation atandSection;442.462(a) that would require facilities to provide or arrangefor the provision of physician services 24 hours a day. They were concernedthat the provision of physician services 24 hours a day could be interpretedto mean that the physician must be on the premises.  Response: We have accepted these comments and included revised languagein the final regulations at andSection;483.460. Section 483.460 specifiesthat ``the facility must ensure the availability of physician services24 hours a day.'' This should make it clear that the physician does notneed to be on the premises. The revised wording, however, does not negatethe fact that facilities not having a physician directly employed musthave a formal arrangement for physician services. With respect to thesearrangements, the final rule at andSection;483.410(d)(2), concerning servicesprovided through outside arrangements, requires that services not provideddirectly must be provided under a written agreement.  In revising this regulation, it came to our attention that the proposedregulations contained some redundancy with regard to physician services.Both the proposed andSection;442.462 concerning physician services, and theproposed andSection;442.466 concerning comprehensive health services hadstatements requiring physician services 24 hours a day. To eliminate thisrepetition, as well as make other changes that will be explained in subsequentsections of the preamble, we have reorganized the material that was containedin the three proposed sections: andSection;442.462, ``Physician services'';andSection;442.464, ``Physician participation''; and, andSection;442.466, ``Comprehensivehealth services''. In the final rule, we have incorporated them into twosections: andSection;483.460(a), ``Standard: Physician services'', and andSection;483.460(b),``Standard: Physician participation in the individual program plan''. Therevised statement regarding 24 hours a day availability of physician servicesis contained in the final rule under standard andSection;483.460(a), Physicianservices.  <T3>AA. Physician Participation (Proposed andSection;442.464, Final andSection;483.460(b)) </T3><T3>Comment: </T3>Nineteen commenters objected to the requirement thatphysicians develop a medical care plan on clients when they determine sucha plan is necessary. The commenters felt that the regulations should includea more precise definition of when a medical care plan is required.  Response: We agree with these comments and have modified the language containedin proposed regulations to now state that a medical care plan is necessarywhen 24 hour licensed nursing care is needed. This revised language islocated in the final rule at andSection;483.460(a), ``Standard: Physicianservices''.  <T3>BB. Comprehensive Health Services (Proposed andSection;442.466; FinalandSection;483.460(a))  </T3><T3>Comment: </T3>Eight commenters expressed an opinion on the componentsof the physical examination required under proposed andSection;442.466(b).These annual physicals require examinations of vision and hearing; routineimmunizations and tuberculosis control; screening laboratory examinationsas determined necessary by the physician, and special studies if needed.Some commenters preferred the words ``evaluate'' vision and hearing ratherthan ``examination'' of vision and hearing. Additionally, some commenterspreferred the language as it appears in current regulations at andSection;442.477,over the language in the proposed rule. The current andSection;442.477 requiresthe physician to use the guidelines of the Public Health Service AdvisoryCommittee on Immunization Practices and the American Academy of Pediatricsregarding immunizations and the American College of Chest Physicians orthe American Academy of Pediatrics regarding tuberculosis control. It alsorequires the reporting of communicable diseases and infections in accordancewith law.  Response: We have accepted these comments and have made revisions in thefinal regulations. We will use the term ``evaluate'' vision and hearingrather than ``examination'' of vision and hearing. We also have reinstatedthe language of current regulations andSection;442.477 that urges physiciansto follow the guidelines of the Public Health Service and the AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics with regard to immunizations and the American Collegeof Chest Physicians or the American Academy of Pediatrics regarding tuberculosiscontrol. However, we have not incorporated into the final rule that partof the current regulations at andSection;442.477 that requires the reportingof communicable diseases. We believe this requirement is well establishedin State law, compliance with which is required by andSection;483.410(b)of these final regulations.                Also, in making the changes recommended by the commenters, we have incorporatedinto the condition concerning health care services under andSection; 483.460of the final rule, the material that was contained in the three proposedsections: andSection; 442.462, ``Physician services'', andSection; 442.464,``Physician participation'' and andSection; 442.466, ``Comprehensive healthservices''. Section 483.460(a) of the final rule contains the standardfor physician services, and paragraph (b) contains the standard for physicianparticipation in the IPP.In the final rule, the standard for physician services at andSection; 483.460(a)will retain the requirement for the availability of physician services24 hours a day as well as the requirement that to the extent permittedby State law the facility may utilize physician assistants and nurse practitioners.The material regarding the development of a medical care plan previouslyunder proposed andSection; 442.464, has been moved to this section. Additionally,the requirement for general medical and preventive health services as wellas annual physical examinations previously under the standard for comprehensivehealth services at the proposed andSection; 442.466 has been moved to thissection. Also, as mentioned in the response to the comments on sectionandSection; 442.466, the components of the physical examination have beenrevised to include the same general requirement of current regulationsandSection; 442.477.The new standard at andSection; 483.460(b) concerning physician participationin the individual program plan will contain two of the requirements previouslyfound under the proposed standard for physician participation at andSection;442.464. These are the requirements for physician participation in theestablishment of each newly admitted clients' IPP as well as physicianparticipation in the review and update of the IPP as appropriate.CC. Nursing Services (Proposed andSection; 442.468, Final andSection; 483.460(c))<T3>Comment: </T3>Thirty-one commenters objected to the proposed regulationsat andSection; 442.468(a) that would require nursing services to includethe development, review, and update of an IPP as part of the interdisciplinaryteam process. They recommend that the regulations specify that nurses participatein the IPP process only when clients have nursing needs.Response: We have accepted these comments. We have revised the regulationsto read nursing services must include participation as appropriate in thedevelopment, review, and update of an IPP as part of the interdisciplinaryteam process.<T3>Comment: </T3>Six commenters expressed views on the proposed regulationsat andSection; 442.468(c) that would require an onsite, direct physical reviewat least quarterly by licensed nurses for clients who do not have a medicalcare plan. Specific comments were: The direct physical review does notnecessarily need to take place in the facility and therefore the word onsiteshould be removed; the term direct physical review should be defined; andfinally a quarterly review may not be frequent enough for some clients.Response: We have revised the regulations to omit the word onsite. Thepurpose of the direct physical review is to identify any health problemsthat might need medical intervention or any potential health problems thatcould be prevented. We have, however, retained the word ``direct'' whichmeans that the nurse must review the client directly and not through anotherstaff member such as a member of the direct care staff or through a medicalrecord review.We have also revised the regulations to read ``direct physical examination''rather than ``direct physical review''. We will explain in interpretiveguidelines that this means a visual review of the body as well as any tactileexamination that might be necessary. A paper review of the patient's medicalrecord and health statistics is not a direct physical examination.We agree with the commenters that a quarterly physical review of each clientby licensed nurses may not be frequent enough for some clients. Althoughthe proposed regulation reads ``at least quarterly'', we have emphasizedthe fact that this is a minimal requirement by rephrasing the regulationsto read ``on a quarterly or more frequent basis''. This will mean thatthe facility will have to conduct quarterly reviews on all clients, butpotentially more frequent reviews on clients who may require more frequentnurse surveillance.In making the above revisions, we realized that the proposed andSection;andSection;442.468(c) and 442.470(d) contained duplicative requirements for healthsurveillance of clients on a quarterly basis. The only difference betweenthe requirements is that the proposal at andSection; 442.470(d) would requirethat licensed nursing personnel conduct the health surveillance. In thisfinal rule, we have eliminated the duplication. The requirement for thequarterly health surveillance of clients by a licensed nurse appears infinal regulations at andSection; 483.460(c).<T3>Comment: </T3>There were two comments on the proposed regulation thatwould require nurses to participate in training clients and staff as neededin appropriate health and hygiene methods. The commenters questioned whetheror not the topics of health and hygiene included sex education.Response: It is the intent of the proposed regulation that training inhealth and hygiene methods include the topic of sex education. This willbe made clear in the interpretive guidelines.DD. Nursing Staff (Proposed andSection; 442.270, Final andSection; 483.460(d))<T3>Comment: </T3>Twenty commenters objected to the provision in andSection;442.470(c) requiring a facility to employ a licensed nurse on one fullshift 7 days a week. Seventeen of the twenty felt that the requirementwas too costly; one felt that job-sharing should be recognized as an appropriatemeans to accomplish the full-time equivalency; one suggested that contractualarrangements be recognized as an appropriate means of providing nursingservices; one commenter felt the requirement should be changed to requirea licensed nurse at least 16 hours a day, 7 days a week with a licensednurse ``on call'' during the remaining 8 hours.Response: We have accepted these comments except for the one requestingthat facilities be required to provide 16 hours of licensed nursing timeper day, 7 days a week. Since they had the same basic intent, we have combinedthe proposed requirements at andSection; 442.470 (b) and (c) and incorporatedthem into the final rule at andSection; 483.460(c) to state that the facilitymust employ or arrange for licensed nursing services sufficient to carefor clients health needs including those clients with medical care plans.This gives each facility more freedom to determine what nursing servicesare required for its particular client population. Also, there is nothingin these final regulations which prohibit the use of job-sharing to meetthe nursing personnel requirement.<T3>Comment: </T3>The proposed andSection; 442.460(d) would require facilitiesthat use only licensed practical or vocational nurses to have a formalarrangement with a registered nurse for consultation. One commenter suggestedthat the consultation be a monthly activity with a flexible amount of time.Another commenter requested that the frequency of consultation and amountof time for consultative activities be specified. Finally, one commentersuggested that four hours of R.N. consultation per week be required infacilities with 16 or fewer beds.Response: We disagree with the general thrust of these comments becausewe believe that the consultation needs of each facility cannot be specifiedin regulations. The nursing care needs of clients vary considerably fromfacility to facility. The amount of R.N. consultation time should be basedon the needs of the clients. Thus, we have allowed facilities flexibilityby not prescribing in regulations the number of R.N. consultation hoursthey must provide.The proposed andSection; 442.460(d) that would require a quarterly nursesurveillance of each client without a medical care plan was duplicativeof the material in the proposed andSection; 442.468(c). Therefore, it hasbeen removed. (See the discussion under the response to comments regardingthe proposed andSection; 442.468(c), Nursing services.)EE. Dental Services (Proposed andSection; 442.472, Final andSection; 483.460(e))<T3>Comment: </T3>Twenty commenters objected to the proposed regulationthat would require dental professionals to participate as appropriate inthe development, review, and update of the IPP as part of the interdisciplinaryprocess. The majority of the commenters requested clarification on howthe dentist is expected to participate. Most of the commenters felt thatthe dentist should be able to submit a written report to the interdisciplinaryteam.Response: We have accepted these comments. We agree that participationof the dentist can be through a written report. We therefore have modifiedthe regulation to read: If appropriate, dental professionals must participatein the development, review, and update of an IPP as part of the interdisciplinaryprocess either in person or through a written report to the interdisciplinaryteam.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that we retain current regulationsfound at andSection; 442.459, ``Education and training''. These regulationsrequire the facility to provide education and training in the maintenanceof oral health.Response: We have accepted the commenter's suggestion and have added aprovision to final regulations andSection; 483.460(e)(3) to require the facilityto provide education and training in the maintenance of oral health.FF. Comprehensive Dental Treatment (Proposed andSection; 442.476, Final andSection;483.460(f))<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters expressed views on the proposed requirementfor comprehensive dental treatment services including dental care neededfor relief of pain and infections, restoration of teeth and maintenanceof dental health. In their view, reimbursement for comprehensive servicesis not available in every State and the regulations should not requireservices for which there is no reimbursement.Response: Dental services are included in the ICF/MR benefit, even thougha particular State may elect not to cover them separately for <T3>non</T3>-ICF/MR recipients. The law and regulations require that Statesmake adequate payments (see andSection; 447.253(b)(i)). The Medicaid statute(at section 1902(a)(13)(A)) states, in part, that payment rates for ICF/MRservices must be ``* * * reasonable and adequate to meet the costs whichmust be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities inorder to provide care and services in conformity with applicable Stateand Federal laws, regulations, and quality and safety standards * * *''.Thus, we would expect a State's ICF/MR payment rates reasonably to reflectthe various items and services which constitute the ICF/MR benefit.<T3>Comment: </T3>Four commenters expressed opinions on the proposed regulationthat would require the provision of emergency dental treatment on a 24-hour-a-daybasis by a licensed dentist. In their view, it is the availability of theservices that is at issue, not the provision.Response: We have accepted these comments and have amended the regulationto require that comprehensive dental treatment services include the availabilityof emergency dental treatment on a 24-hour-a-day basis by a licensed dentist.GG. Documentation (Proposed andSection; 442.478; Final andSection; 483.460(h))<T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters expressed an opinion on the proposedstandard that would require the facility to provide a copy of the dentalrecord (if available) or the most recent dental summary to the client,his parents, or guardian upon discharge from the facility. In their view,the requirement is not necessary and increases program costs.Response: We agree with the commenter and have deleted this requiremententirely. A general requirement found in these final regulations at andSection;483.410(c)(3) addresses the general issue of confidentiality of clientrecords and requires the facility to develop policies and procedures forthe release of client information.HH. Pharmacy Services (Proposed andSection; 442.480; Final andSection; 483.460(i))<T3>Comment: </T3>Thirteen commenters expressed approval of this standardbecause it would place the responsibility for the provision of drugs andbiologicals on the facility whether the facility does so directly or througharrangement. One commenter objected to the requirement that would allowfacilities to use ``off site'' pharmacies because they would not be ableto meet the <T3>immediate needs </T3>of ICF/MR clients.Response: Current regulations allow a facility to obtain pharmaceuticalservices from an outside resource, and we believe that these final regulationsshould continue that practice especially with the growth of small facilitieswith 16 or fewer beds that could not realistically operate their own pharmacies.II. Drug Regimen Review (Proposed andSection; 442.482; Final andSection; 483.460(j))<T3>Comment: </T3>A number of commenters objected to the proposed requirementthat would involve the pharmacist, as appropriate, in the development ofthe IPP. Many did not feel that the participation of the pharmacist wasnecessary. Others thought the pharmacist's participation could take placeby means of written comment. Still others thought that the pharmacist shouldhave input from the indisciplinary group instead of the pharmacist participating,as appropriate, in the development of the client's IPP.Response: We have accepted the suggestion of the commenters who thoughtthe pharmacist could participate in the IPP by means of a written reportand have revised the regulations accordingly at andSection; 483.460(j)(5).We also agreed with the commenter who suggested that the pharmacist reviewermust conduct reviews with input from the interdisciplinary team and haveadded this provision to the final rule at andSection; 483.460(j)(1).<T3>Comment: </T3>We received only one public comment on the issue of requiringa pharmacist rather than a registered nurse to conduct quarterly drug regimenreviews. However, we received many comments on this issue in response toa proposed rule published on May 16, 1986 (51 FR 17997) concerning drugregimen reviews in skilled nursing and intermediate care facilities. Inthat proposal, we again had stated that we would allow either a pharmacistor a nurse to conduct these reviews. Approximately 100 commenters objectedstating that they believed that only a pharmacist should conduct the reviews.The commenters stated that registered nurses did not have the time or theknowledge base to conduct the reviews adequately. As a result of the publiccomments concerning drug regimen reviews in skilled nursing and intermediatecare facilities, we issued, on June 15, 1987 (52 FR 22638), a final regulationthat permits only a pharmacist to conduct these reviews in skilled nursingand intermediate care facilities.Response: In response to the public comments received on the May 16, 1986rule, and in order to achieve consistency in the regulations, and becausewe believe that the proper conduct of these reviews can best be assuredby requiring that a pharmacist perform them, we have modified the finalrule to permit that only a pharmacist may conduct these reviews. JJ. Drug Administration (Proposed andSection; 442.484; Final andSection; 483.460(k))<T3>Comment: </T3>There were 49 commenters who expressed opinions on thisproposed standard. A significant number of these commenters objected tothe requirement at the proposed andSection; 442.484(b) for administeringdrugs without error. Many felt this standard was unrealistic and askedthat it be deleted. Others believed that medication errors should be addressedbut some tolerance should be allowed. Others wished to defer to State lawon this issue, and some complained that the facility should not be heldresponsible for clients who make errors while ``on pass'' from the facility.Finally, one commenter complained that the facility would modify recordsto cover-up medication errors. Response: We have carefully reviewed these comments and our current surveyprocedures for identifying medication errors and have decided not to modifythe proposed regulation. The current surveyor procedure for medicationerrors relies on an observation technique and not on records. It allowsan overall tolerance of five percent for non-significant medication errorsbut faults the facility for any one error considered a threat to the healthand safety of an individual client. This medication error detection methodologyhas been in use for several years and has demonstrated its ability to changethe behavior of the facility so that errors are identified and a genuineeffort is made to reduce their incidence. The surveyor procedure used todetect medication errors does not include the observation of drugs administeredwhile clients are ``on pass'' from the facility. Since medication errorshave been shown to be a significant problem in a wide variety of healthcare facilities, we are retaining this requirement unchanged. <T3>Comment: </T3>A significant portion of the commenters also expressedconcern about the provision at the proposed andSection; 484.484(g) that wouldrequire a pharmacist to package and label all drugs used by the clientwhile the client is not under the direct control of the facility. Thisproposal was an effort to assure proper labeling and packaging of the drugsthat clients must possess while enroute to and at various off-site workshops,classes, and home visits. Many commenters expressed concern about the availabilityof the pharmacist to perform this task on short notice as is the case withmany home visits. Another commenter emphasized that some States now havestandards that allow facility personnel under specific circumstances torepackage and label drugs for clients ``on pass''. Response: We were convinced by these arguments and have modified the finalregulation (andSection; 483.460(k)(7)) to state that such drugs are ``packagedand labeled in accordance with State law'' instead of ``packaged and labeledby the pharmacists''. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters complained that medication errorsand adverse drug reactions when they do occur should be reported only toa physician and not to the registered nurse as would be allowed under theproposed andSection; 442.484(i). Response: We have accepted this comment. We are not including registerednurses among those to whom these events can be reported. <T3>Comment: </T3>There was general support for the use of unlicensed personnelto administer drugs if State law permits. However, some commenters expressedconcern about the proposed regulation at andSection; 442.484(c) that wouldrequire a registered nurse to teach unlicensed personnel about the facility-specificaspects of drug administration. Response: The original objective of this training was to assure that theunlicensed personnel have training in the unique aspects of a particularfacility's drug distribution system. Because this requirement may presentinterpretive problems and because the objective is basically covered underthe standard for staff training at andSection; 483.430(e) of this final rule,it has been deleted as a specific requirement under the standard for drugadministration. KK. Drug Storage and Record Keeping (Proposed andSection; 442.486; FinalandSection; 483.460(l)) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter wanted to add a requirement to the proposalto require the pharmacist to inspect drug storage areas in the facility.Response: We have no objections to a pharmacist periodically inspectingdrug storage areas and reporting problems to the facility. However, wedo not believe that it is necessary to mandate this through regulation.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the receipt and dispositionof controlled drugs be reconciled on a routine basis (for example, everyshift or everyday) rather than on a sample basis as required by the proposedrule at andSection; 442.486(d). Response: We do not wish to mandate a routine reconciliation of controlleddrugs unless a sample reconciliation indicates a more frequent reconciliationis necessary (for example, in the case of missing controlled drugs). Webelieve it is unnecessary to require a facility to perform routine checksfor missing controlled drugs unless there is a good reason to do so. LL. Labeling (Proposed andSection; 442.488; Final andSection; 483.460(m)) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter objected to the requirement at proposedandSection; 442.488(b) that would prohibit the facility from retaining outdateddrugs or drugs with missing or torn labels. The commenter suggested thatsuch drugs be removed from use. The same commenter suggested that drugs discontinued by the physician be``immediately removed from the client's current medication supply'' ratherthan the wording at proposed andSection; 442.488(c) that states that suchdrugs must ``not be available for administration''.Response: We have accepted both of these comments and have incorporatedthe new language into these final regulations.MM. Laboratory Services (Proposed andSection; 442.489; Final andSection; 483.460(n))<T3>Comment: </T3>There were seven commenters on the proposed requirementat andSection; 442.489(d)(1) that the laboratory director must be eithera pathologist or a doctor of medicine or osteopathy with training and experiencein clinical laboratory services; or a laboratory specialist with a doctoraldegree in physical, chemical or biological sciences, and training and experiencein clinical laboratory services. Most of the commenters felt that the requirementswere unnecessarily high. Commenters had a variety of suggestions for changingthe provision, such as requiring: a baccalaureate degree with a major ina physical, chemical, or biological science plus appropriate experience;a laboratory technologist certified by the American Society of ClinicalPathologists; a trained laboratory technologist with regular consultationsfrom a Clinical Pathologist. One commenter said the requirement shouldbe guided by State law.Response: We have not adopted the comments requesting lower qualificationsfor the position of laboratory director. However, currently the Departmenthas underway a thorough review of all clinical laboratory regulations.During the next year, the Department will be proposing regulation changesand other reforms intended to remove inconsistencies and eliminate unnecessarycredentialing requirements while continuing to ensure patient health andsafety. We have adopted the request that the requirement be guided by Statelaw when State laws address the qualification requirements for directorsof laboratory services.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters felt that requirements for laboratoryservices in ICFs/MR should be the same as the conditions for coverage ofservices of independent laboratories found at 42 CFR Part 405, SubpartM.Response: The proposed requirements for laboratory services in ICFs/MRare fundamentally the same as the conditions for coverage of services ofindependent laboratories currently found in Subpart M. For example therequirements contained in Subpart M at andSection;andSection; 405.1314(a),405.1316 and 405.1317 were incorporated into the proposed regulations bythe cross reference found in andSection; 442.489 (c), (e) and (f). This cross-referencewas retained in the final rule. The personnel requirements in both theproposed and final laboratory standards are considerably less detailedthan those found in Subpart M. As stated in our response to the previouscomment, the Department has currently underway a thorough review of allclinical laboratory regulations including personnel requirements. Followingthis review, changes to the regulations may be proposed that would impacton laboratory services, including laboratory services in ICFs/MR.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters felt that it may be necessary to limitlaboratory testing in small institutions of under 50 beds. Additionallyone of the commenters recommended prohibiting on-premises testing in thosefacilities with 16 or fewer beds.Response: We cannot accept the comment regarding limiting laboratory testingin small institutions because there is no consensus as to what tests shouldand should not be performed in smaller facilities. We also did not acceptthe comment recommending prohibiting on-premises testing in those facilitieswith 16 or fewer beds. This prohibition is unnecessary because we believethat such small facilities would not attempt to meet the laboratory servicesrequirements in order to do the few tests their clients might require.The new regulations will, however, require small facilities that collecttheir own specimens to refer those specimens for testing to laboratoriesthat are approved for participation in the Medicare program.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters felt that the proposed regulationswere unclear with regard to when or if facilities are to provide laboratoryservices.Response: We agree with the commenters that the proposed regulations wereunclear on these points. The proposed andSection; 442.489(b) stated, ``Ifan ICF/MR that meets the requirements of this subpart operates its ownlaboratory, the laboratory must * * * ''. The intent of the proposal wasto permit facilities to choose whether or not they wish to provide laboratoryservices. If a facility does wish to provide these services, it must meetthe proposed requirements of andSection; 442.489. To make this point clear,we have incorporated in the final regulations at andSection; 483.360(n) languagethat reads, ``If a facility chooses to provide laboratory services'', thelaboratory must meet the specified requirements.<T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters stated that it was unclear whether or notthe laboratory is simply to be used as a drawing station for the collectionof specimens which are then sent out to an independent laboratory for study.Response: The proposed requirements for laboratory services were not intendedfor a laboratory that operates only as a drawing station. We indicatedin the proposal at andSection; 442.489(a) that for purposes of this section,``laboratory'' would mean a facility for the performance of specified laboratorytests. Nothing in the proposed or final regulations, however, prohibitsan ICF/MR from operating a drawing station; that is, the referral of specimensto other laboratories. We have attempted to make this clear in the regulationby requiring that if the facility chooses to refer specimens for testingto a laboratory, the referral laboratory must be approved by the Medicareprogram either as a hospital laboratory or an independent laboratory.<T3>Comment: </T3>Section 442.416 of the proposed regulations would requirethat facilities must be in compliance with all applicable provisions ofFederal, State and local laws. The proposed regulations at andSection; 442.489(b)(1)would require that a laboratory be licensed or approved according to Statelaw if it is located in a State that provides for the licensing or approvedof laboratories. Commenters stated that this is duplicative and thereforeshould be removed.Response: We have accepted this comment and have removed this provisionfrom the standard on laboratory services.NN. Client Living Environment (Proposed andSection; 442.500; Final andSection;483.470(a))<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters noted that there is an apparent contradictionin the proposed andSection; 442.500 between paragraph (a), which would prohibita facility from housing together clients of grossly different ages, developmentallevels, and social needs unless the housing promotes their mutual growthand development, and paragraph (b), which would prohibit segregating clientson the basis of physical handicaps and requires integration of physicallyhandicapped clients with others of comparable social and intellectual development.Response: We note that a client living pattern which takes into accountsuch factors as age, developmental levels, and social needs (paragraph(a)) is not equivalent to a client living pattern based on physical handicap(paragraph b)). Paragraph (a), in referring to ``grossly different ages,''is intended to ensure, for example, that very young children are not inappropriatelyhoused together with much older, adult clients. While it can be arguedthat a certain degree of client mix promotes normalization, extreme differencesmay in some instances actually impede appropriate training and pose a threatto the safety of younger, more vulnerable clients. If clients of grosslydifferent ages, developmental levels, or social needs are housed in closeproximity, the facility must demonstrate that it has planned this housingto promote the clients' mutual growth and development. Paragraph (b), onthe other hand, prohibits segregation on the basis of physical handicap:that is, housing clients together only because they have physical disabilities.This paragraph indicates that the facility should house its clients basedon common skill levels; that is, comparable social and intellectual levelsof development, rather than by physical disability. Therefore, we do notbelieve that there is any contradiction between paragraphs (a) and (b).<T3>Comment: </T3>A number of commenters asserted that the proposed prohibitionof segregation by handicap under andSection; 442.500(b) of the proposed rulepotentially conflicts with other important objectives, such as the abilityto address individual clients' specialized training needs; fire safety(for example, placement of wheelchair-bound clients near fire exits); andthe ability to establish specialized ICFs/MR for clients with specificdevelopmental disabilities.Response: We do not believe that clients with a common physical disabilitynecessarily must be housed together in order to meet their specializedtraining needs. Such housing would be appropriate only if all of the clientswith a particular disability also happened to be at the same skill leveland, thus, had identical training needs. Again, in this situation, thefacility should look to the client's skill level, rather than physicaldisability, in determining appropriate housing patterns.Regarding the comment about the possible effect of housing patterns basedon concerns for fire safety, we note that housing of non-ambulatory individualscurrently is permitted in facilities such as community group homes, aslong as the facility meets applicable fire safety requirements. Also, wedo not believe that the provisions of this section of the regulations preventthe establishment of specialized ICFs/MR for clients with specific developmentaldisabilities, since it does not deal with the types of individuals thata facility admits, but only with the housing of clients once they are admitted.<T3>Comment: </T3>Some commenters suggested that, in the proposed andSection;442.500(b), the term ``handicaps'' should be replaced with ``disabilities,''and the term ``epileptic'' should be replaced with ``persons with seizuredisorders''.Response: We accept these comments, and have revised the final regulationsaccordingly.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that, in implementing these regulations,a distinction should be made between large facilities and small homes.Response: The basic purpose of this provision is to establish the generalprinciple that the facility should house together clients who are at comparabledevelopmental levels, and to permit housing of disparate clients togetheronly if it promotes their mutual growth and development. We believe thata special distinction regarding small facilities is unnecessary, sincethe population in such settings normally tends to be more homogeneous.Also, we note that even in small facilities, these regulations do not precludehousing clients at different developmental levels in close proximity, aslong as the housing promotes their mutual growth and development.OO. Client Bedrooms (Proposed andSection; 442.502; Final andSection; 483.470(b))<T3>Comment: </T3>We received comments suggesting that various provisionsof current regulations andSection;andSection; 442.436 (Personal possessions);442.442 (Resident clothing); and 442.404(g)(6) (permitting married couplesto share a room) relating to individual rights should be retained.Response: Section 442.401(k) of the proposed regulations (final andSection;483.420(a)(11)) already addressed two of the commenters' concerns in thatit would require that clients be permitted to retain and use personal possessionsand appropriate clothing. We are restoring the provision regarding marriedcouples sharing a room to the section on protection of clients' rights(final regulations at andSection; 483.420(a)(12)).<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters suggested adding a requirement for anappropriately sized window to the proposal at andSection; 442.502(a)(1) thatwould require each room to have at least one outside wall.Response: This requirement was already addressed in the proposed andSection;442.508(a)(1) that would require each bedroom to have at least one windowto the outside, and in the proposed andSection; 442.502(b) that would requirethat the window in a below-grade bedroom be usable as a second means ofescape. In the final rule, these provisions are lcoated at andSection; 483.470(b)(1)and (2)(i).<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters requested us to define ``newly certified,''as used in the proposed andSection; 442.502(a)(5) that would require floor-to-ceilingwalls in all ``newly certified'' facilities.Response: We are revising the final regulations at andSection; 483.470(b)(1)(v)to clarify our intent. In the final rule, we have used the word ``initially''instead of ``newly'', and have modified the regulation so that all facilities``initially certified'' on or after the effective date of these regulationsmust have walls that extend from floor to ceiling. This regulation affectsonly those facilities ``initially certified'' after the effective dateof the regulations. A facility that is certified for participation in Medicaidafter a period of non-participation (because its certification had beenterminated or voluntarily withdrawn) is considered an ``initial certification''and will be required to install floor to ceiling walls.We note that the proposed rule did not address the issue of floor to ceilingwalls when an ICF/MR carried out new construction, renovation or conversion.To address this issue, we have modified the regulation so it requires afacility to install floor to ceiling walls in newly constructed portionsand during major renovations or conversions. We will explain in interpretiveguidelines that, in our view, ``new construction and major renovationsor conversions take place if: (1) Clients must vacate the facility; (2)no Medicaid billing takes place; (3) a resurvey is required before clientsreturn.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters requested clarification of proposedandSection; 442.502 paragraph (b) that would permit below-grade bedroomsand provide specifications for windows in them. Points requiring clarificationincluded: ground level versus floor level windows; requiring that windowsbe usable as a means of escape by the client occupying the room; and, thatwindow measurements are taken from the sill.Response: We are revising the final regulations at andSection; 483.470(b)(2)to clarify that, in a below-grade level bedroom, the window must be nomore than 44 inches above floor level (for facilities surveyed under theHealth Care Occupancy Chapter of the Life Safety Code, the window mustbe no more than 36 inches above the floor); that the window must be usableas a second means of escape by the client occupying the room; and, thatfloor-to-window measurements are taken to the sill.<T3>Comment: </T3>Since the proposed andSection; 442.502(c) mentions onlya medical basis for granting a variance to permit more than four clientsper bedroom, a physician, rather than psychologist, should make this determination.Response: We agree with this comment, and will delete the words ``or psychologist''from the language describing the type of individual that can grant a varianceto the limit of four clients per bedroom (final regulation andSection; 483.470(b)(3)).<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested granting a variance to the four-client-per-bedroomlimit for behavioral as well as medical problems; still others suggestedeliminating the variance provision altogether, or granting a variance onlywith the interdisciplinary team's approval. Other commenters recommendeda maximum of two, rather than four, clients per bedroom.Response: We are retaining the variance provision. While we do not regardbroadening the variance procedure (for example, to include behavioral problems)as appropriate, we also believe that eliminating the variance altogetherwould pose serious problems for some facilities.<T3>Comment: </T3>A number of commenters requested clarification of theproposal at andSection; 442.502(d)(2) that would require a ``fire safe''mattress. Several indicated that a mattress which is literally fire safeis impossible to obtain or, at best, is uncomfortable, expensive, and inappropriatefor use in a health care facility. Others suggested requiring instead a``fire resistant'' mattress cover or simply a reference to applicable LifeSafety Code or National Fire Protection Association standards.Response: The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) administers regulationsthat prohibit the sale of mattresses that have not passed their requirementsfor Flammability of Mattresses (and Mattress Pads) (16 CFR Part 1632).These regulations prohibit the sale of mattresses manufactured or importedin the United States unless they have passed a standard test for cigaretteignition, which is generally regarded as being one of the leading causesof mattress fires. These requirements became effective June 22, 1973. Thus,all mattresses purchased by ICFs/MR after that date were subject to CPSCrequirements. As facilities replace mattresses, we expect this potentialrisk to diminish (a CPSC study of hotels and similar occupancies showedthat about \2/3\ of the mattresses have been replaced since June 22, 1973).Because CPSC enforces these regulations, there is no need for HCFA to establishseparate standards defining fire safe mattresses. Therefore, in these finalregulations we have deleted the reference to fire safe mattresses.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that the proposed requirementat andSection; 442.502(d)(3) for appropriate bedding be clarified specificallyto permit the use of a single bedspread year-round if it is appropriatefor all seasons. Several others suggested that the proposal at andSection;442.502(d)(4), which would require an individual closet for each client,be changed to allow the alternative of individual space in a shared closet.Response: With regard to bedspreads, we believe that interpretative guidelineswould be a more appropriate vehicle for making this clarification, andwe will include it in the guidelines when they are published.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">With regard to closets, we are clarifying the final regulations atandSection;483.470(b)(4)(iv) by requiring the facility to provide each clientwith individual closet space in the client's bedroom. This permits thefacility either to provide the client with an individual bedroom closetor with a designated area in a shared bedroom closet, but precludes theuse of clothing bins in a facility clothing room. <T3>Comment: </T3>Some commenters indicated that the proposed andSection;442.502(d)(4),in describing bedroom furniture, should simply require furniture ``as appropriateto the needs of the client'' rather than requiring a desk for a clientwho cannot use it. Another commenter suggested that a night table be requiredrather than a table or desk, as being closer to normal bedroom furniture.Response: Regarding the types of ``appropriate'' furniture described inthis provision, we note that these items are mentioned as illustrativeexamples only; we did not intend this language to require a particulartype of furniture, such as a desk, for a client who is unable to use it,or for whom it is otherwise contraindicated. Rather, each client shouldhave furniture, appropriate to his or her needs, that is used by the clientalone. However, in order to avoid possible confusion, we are deleting theexamples and revising the final regulations at andSection;483.470(b)(4)(iv)to require that the facility furnish each client with functional furnitureappropriate to that client's needs. We use the descriptive term ``functional''furniture to distinguish these items from the use of decorative ``furnishings,''such as plants, pictures, etc., which, though encouraged as being an appropriateand desirable aspect of a normalized living environment, cannot serve asa substitute for appropriate furniture. PP. Storage Space in Living Units (Proposed andSection;442.504; Final andSection;483.470(c))<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that we define ``living unit''as used in the proposed andSection;andSection;442.504, 442.508 and 442.510.Response: We are deleting this term where it appears in the proposed regulations,and substituting the terms ``bedroom'' and ``area used by clients'', asappropriate. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that proposed andSection;442.504(b)should provide not only for storage of the client's personal possessions,but for the safety of these possessions as well. Response: We believe that the safety of the possessions is implied in therequirement that there be ``suitable'' storage space, therefore, no changeis being made. <T3>Comment: </T3>Another commenter on proposed andSection;442.504 paragraph(b) advocated limitations on accessibility of personal possessions undera behavior modification program or when the interdisciplinary team determinesthat access would endanger the client or others. Response: We agree that limitations on accessibility of personal possessionscan be appropriate in certain situations. However, we do not believe thatprescriptive regulations are necessary in order to permit this. Proposedparagraph (b) merely requires that the client have access to the spacein which his or her personal possessions are ordinarily stored. While thisimplies access to the possessions themselves, it does not require unrestrictedaccess in situations where this is precluded by an active treatment programdesigned to eliminate inappropriate behavior or in which the interdisciplinaryteam determines that unrestricted access would endanger the client or others.<T3>Comment: </T3>The proposed andSection;442.504(c) would require adequateclean linen and dirty linen storage areas. Several commenters said thatsmall facilities should not be required to have separate storage roomsfor clean and dirty laundry; rather, it would be sufficient to requirespecific procedures to prevent contamination and unsanitary practices.Others suggested that we permit a bedroom hamper, if sanitary and odor-free,to be used for dirty laundry storage. Response: The laundry storage requirement in this provision requires cleanlinen and dirty linen storage ``areas'' rather than ``rooms.'' This meansthat clean linen and dirty linen must be stored separately, but need notbe stored in different rooms. A bedroom hamper would be an acceptable dirtylinen storage ``area'' if kept clean and odor-free, consistent with theinfection control requirements of final regulations at andSection;483.470(l).QQ. Client Bathrooms (Proposed andSection;442.506; Final andSection;483.470(d))<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that under the provisions ofthe proposed andSection;442.506 each bathroom should be equipped with a mirrorand sink/toothbrush training area. Response: We believe that this is already implied in proposed andSection;442.506(a)'srequirement for ``bathing facilities appropriate * * * in design to meetthe needs of the clients''. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters expressed concern about the proposedrequirement for bathroom privacy unless contraindicated by the client'scondition. One commenter stated that any contraindications to bathroomprivacy should be determined by the interdisciplinary team and should beindicated in the client's individual program plan.Response: We agree with those commenters who stated that individual privacyin toilets, bathtubs, and showers does not preclude assistance given fromthe facility's staff when necessitated by the individual client's condition.Accordingly, we have deleted the provision ``unless contraindicated bythe client's condition'' from the final rule at andSection; 483.470(d)(2).However, we do not think that the regulations should attempt to identifyevery situation that can conceivably be placed in the individual programplan. Placement of this information in the IPP should be at the discretionof the facility.<T3>Comment: </T3>Other commenters stated that exceptions to privacy shouldbe programmatic rather than incorporated in the physical plant and assertedthat locked bathroom doors should be encouraged when appropriate.Response: As noted above, the provisions of the regulations already assurebathroom privacy. We do not believe it is necessary to include prescriptiveprovisions in the regulations regarding structural design or use of lockedbathroom doors.<T3>Comment: </T3>Another commenter stated that privacy should extend throughthe entire living unit, not just the bathroom.Response: We agree with the general objective of providing for privacy,whenever possible, in the client's living unit; however, this objectivemust be balanced against the need for a reasonable degree of interpersonalcontact and interaction, in order to approximate more closely a normalizedenvironment. In this context, we believe that the client's general rightto privacy is already sufficiently ensured by final regulations at andSection;483.420(a)(7) that require that each client is provided with the opportunityfor personal privacy.<T3>Comment: </T3>A number of comments were received on proposed andSection;442.506(c), which restricts water temperature from hot water taps to 110degrees F. or less in areas of the facility serving clients who have notbeen trained to regulate water temperature. Several of these commentersexpressed support for the exception to the temperature restriction forsuitably-trained clients, noting that this offers a more normalized setting;others noted that the regulations need to be flexible enough to addressfacilities where clients are participating in (but have not yet completed)a training program to regulate water temperature.Response: We believe that the issue of clients who are in the process ofbeing trained to regulate water temperature can be addressed in interpretiveguidelines, which would be based on the assumption that such clients areunder direct supervision while being trained to operate hot water temperaturecontrols.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested a waiver of the water temperaturerestriction when the program director can demonstrate that client safetyis addressed by means other than a control valve.Response: The regulations require only that water from the hot water tapbe maintained at or below a prescribed temperature if clients have notbeen trained to regulate temperature, but do not prescribe the specificmethod (such as a control valve) for doing so.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asserted that having hot water temperaturesbelow 120 degrees F. results in the water temperature being too cold forshowers.Response: We believe that the longstanding limit of 110 degrees F. representsan acceptable balance between comfort and safety factors, and should beretained. A hot water tap that is limited to this temperature, when appropriatelyoperated in conjunction with the cold water tap, should produce sufficientlywarm water temperatures to ensure comfort without posing a threat to thesafety of clients who have not been trained to regulate water temperature.RR. Heating and Ventilation in Living Units (Proposed andSection; 442.508;Final andSection; 483.470(e))<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the proposed andSection; 442.508(a)(1)that would require each client bedroom to have at least one outside window,be changed to at least one outside window or door (that is, allow a doorto be used for room ventilation in lieu of an outside window).Response: Since a door serves primarily to provide egress rather than toperform the ventilation and aesthetic functions of an outside window, wedo not believe the language in the proposed rule should be changed. Inaddition, the outside window serves in an emergency as an alternate meansof escape from a below-grade bedroom (see final regulations andSection; 483.470(b)(2)(i)).<T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters requested that we include a definitionof the term ``normal comfort range'' in the proposed andSection; 442.508(b)(1).Response: We plan to address this issue in interpretive guidelines, whichwould define a normal comfort range in most instances as not going belowa temperature of 68 degrees F. or exceeding a temperature of 81 degreesF. However, the term could also be interpreted to include temperaturesthat exceed the upper range of 81 degrees F. for facilities in geographicareas of the country (primarily at the northernmost latitudes) where thattemperature is exceeded only during rare, brief episodes of unseasonablyhot weather. This interpretation would apply in cases where it does notadversely affect client health and safety, and would enable facilitiesin areas of the country with relatively cold climates to avoid the expenseof installing air conditioning equipment that would only be needed veryinfrequently.SS. Floors in Living Units (Proposed andSection;442.510; Final andSection;483.470(f))<T3>Comment:</T3> Regarding the proposed requirement at andSection;442.510(a)for floors with a ``slip-resistant'' surface, one commenter noted thatany surface is slippery when wet. Regarding the proposal at andSection;442.510(b)for ``nonabrasive'' carpeting is carpeted areas serving clients who crawl,this commenter noted that additional factors should be considered as well,such as mobility, sanitation, and safety. The commenter suggested thatwe require only that attention be given to floor coverings in living unitsbased on the needs of the clients living therein.Response: We note that the regulations do not require that floors be ``slip-free,''but merely ``slip-resistant;'' there is a presumption that the floor surfacewill ordinarily be dry and when wet, precautions taken. Regarding the commentconcerning mobility, sanitation, and safety, we are adding a requirementto final regulations at andSection;483.470(f)(3) for exposed floor surfacesand floor coverings to promote mobility and maintenance of sanitary conditions.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested rewording of proposed andSection;442.510(b)that would require nonabrasive carpeting (if the floors are carpeted) forclients who crawl. The commenter thought the phrase ``clients who crawl''should be replaced with ``clients who lie on the floor or ambulate withparts of their bodies, other than feet, touching the floor.''Response: We agree with this comment, and have revised the final regulationsat andSection;483.470(f)(2) to include this language.TT. Space and Equipment in Dining, Health Services and Program Areas (ProposedandSection;442.512; Final andSection;483.470(g))<T3>Comment:</T3> Regarding the proposed andSection;442.512(a), that describesspace and equipment requirements for various activities, two commenterssuggested that we specifically mention recreation and leisure activities.Response: We agree with this comment, and have added in final regulationsthe word recreation to the list of areas (for example, dining, programareas) for which the facility must provide sufficient space and equipment.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that the space and equipmentrequirement be relocated under the nursing services section of the activetreatment provisions.Response: We believe that this requirement is appropriately located asproposed, in the section dealing with physical environment. Issues directlyinvolving health services are already adequately dealt with elsewhere inthese regulations.<T3>Comment:</T3> The proposed rule at andSection;442.512(b) would requirethe facility to furnish, maintain in good repair, and encourage the useof devices such as dentures, eyeglasses, hearing and other communicationsaids, and braces needed by clients. Almost all of the comments we receivedon this paragraph stressed that the facility should be responsible forfurnishing these items only if Medicaid will pay for them; if Medicaidwill not cover these items, the facility should only be required to facilitatetheir acquisition or assist clients in purchasing them.Response: We note that, under these regulations, the above items are includedin the ICF/MR benefit, even though a particular State may elect not tocover them separately for non-ICF/MR recipients. The Medicaid statute (atsection 1902(a)(13)(A)) states, in part, that payment rates for ICF/MRservices must be ``* * * reasonable and adequate to meet the costs whichmust be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities inorder to provide care and services in conformity with applicable Stateand Federal laws, regulations, and quality and safety standards * * *''.Thus, we would expect a State's ICF/MR payment rates reasonably to reflectthe various items and services which constitute the ICF/MR benefit.<T3>Comment:</T3> With respect to dentures, eyeglasses, etc., one commenterasked us to define the terms ``furnish'' and ``maintain in good repair''.Response: The term ``furnish'' in this context indicates that the facilityis responsible (including financial responsibility) for obtaining theseitems, and is responsible for making any necessary arrangements to enablethe client actually to receive them. (If an item is available free of charge,the facility would satisfy this requirement simply by making the necessaryarrangements for the client to receive it.) The term ``maintain in goodrepair'' indicates that the facility is responsible for ensuring that theseitems are kept in good working order, and is responsible for any resultingexpense that may be incurred. As noted above, we would expect a State'sICF/MR payment rate to reflect reasonably these items and services.UU. Emergency Plan and Procedures (Proposed andSection;442.550; Final andSection;483.470(h))<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter stated that the proposed regulation atandSection;442.550, that would require a facility to make its plan for emergenciesavailable to staff, should also require that staff be trained in implementationof the plan.Response: As we had proposed, the facility is charged (see final regulationsat andSection;483.470(h)(2)) with the responsibility of training the staffin use of the emergency plan and procedures.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter requested clarification of the term ``periodicallyreview'', as it was used in the proposed andSection;442.550(b), that wouldrequire that a facility periodically review its plan to meet emergenciesand disasters.Response: We will explain in interpretive guidelines that the periodicityof this review is a judgment made by the facility based on the circumstancesof the facility. If the facility changes its physical plant or if changesexternal to the facility necessitate a review of the disaster plan, thenthe facility is responsible for carrying out that review.VV. Evacuation Drills (Proposed andSection;442.552; Final andSection;483.470(i))<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that the proposed rule at andSection;442.552that requires evacuation drills include provisions for the non-evacuationof those whose health precludes evacuation during drills.Response: We do not agree with this comment. The drills required by thissection are not only for fire but for other disasters such as hurricanes,tornadoes, floods, etc. In these circumstances, the entire occupancy mayhave to be evacuated. Thus, the entire occupancy must practice these drills.<T3>Comment:</T3> The proposed rule reserved andSection;442.554. One commentersuggested that we use the reserved section to include explicit requirementson building accessibility for the physically handicapped.Response: The issue of building accessibility is covered by civil rightslaws which are invoked under final regulations at andSection;483.410(b),Compliance with Federal, State and local laws. The Office for Civil Rightsimplements Department-wide regulations (see 45 CFR 84.22 and 84.23) relativeto building accessibility for the physically handicapped and HCFA doesnot wish to duplicate or conflict with those regulations.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter proposed adoption of the ``buddy system''of evacuation and was concerned that drills not be conducted in sub-zeroweather without assistance.Response: There is nothing in the proposed regulation that would precludethe use of the ``buddy system''. The regulations do require drills to beconducted under varied conditions but we would not expect drills to beconducted in sub-zero weather.<T3>Comment:</T3> The proposed andSection;442.552(a) would require evacuationdrills to be conducted under ``varied conditions''. One commenter suggestedthat the term ``varied conditions'' be defined.Response: We will explain in interpretive guidelines that the term ``variedconditions'' principally refers to different times of the day and nightand location of clients in respect to rooms in the building. It also refersto weather conditions since quarterly drills would necessitate varied weatherconditions.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed concern that fire safety standardsnot be used to exclude persons with physical handicaps.Response: The adoption of the 1985 Life Safety Code (see <T4>Federal Register,</T4> Friday, April 18, 1986, page 13224) incorporateschapter 21 of the Code that defines three levels of physical plant requirementsdepending on the ability of clients and staff to evacuate the buildingin the event of fire. This new chapter of the Life Safety Code may enableindividuals with physical disabilities to reside in the facility dependingon the disability, the staff in the facility and the physical plant characteristics.We expect that the adoption of Chapter 21 of the Code will allow many moreclients with physical disabilities to reside in small facilities than waspreviously the case.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that each facility be requiredto have at least one fire extinguisher per floor.Response: The Life Safety Code specifies extinguishment requirements forvarious types of occupancies. As a consequence of the adoption of the 1985Life Safety Code (see <T4>Federal Register,</T4> Friday, April 18, 1986, page 13224) HCFA hasadopted the extinguishment requirements of that Code.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters expressed concern that requirementsfor evacuation drills do not allow a client to move to a ``safe area''or from one smoke barrier to another as current regulations allow.Response: We have modified the final regulation at andSection;483.470(i)(2)(v)to allow for evacuation to ``safe areas'' in facilities certified underthe Health Care Occupancies Chapter of the Life Safety Code (note thatcurrent regulations found at 42 CFR 442.506(b)(1) allow evacuation to asafe area).<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter stated there should be greater emphasison staff training for fire evacuation drills. Another commenter thoughtthat clients should have evacuation drills as part of their IPP.Response: We believe that the proposal is adequate in the number of trainingdrills it requires staff to conduct. Additionally, it could be very appropriateto include evacuation drills as part of an IPP if the interdisciplinaryteam, as a result of the client's comprehensive functional assessment,determined that improved performance during evacuation drills was of highpriority for the client to learn. In any case, the final rule at andSection;483.440(c)(3) and (4) requires that objectives, reflective of a client's needs, beincluded as part of the IPP.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter thought that the time it takes clientsto evacuate a building would determine what fire safety requirement thefacility must meet. That is, the slower the clients exit the building themore fire safe it must be.Response: Evacuation drills conducted by the facility will not be the criteriafor deciding which physical plant requirements a facility must meet inorder to comply with Life Safety Code requirements. The State surveyorwill determine the level of fire safety requirements on the basis of anobjective assessment of the clients, the staff and characteristics of thephysical plant.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked whether these regulations shouldcontain a reference to the Life Safety Code.Response: We have included in final regulations at andSection; 483.470(j)requirements for meeting the Life Safety Code. These requirements are locatedin current regulations at andSection; 442.508.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters indicated that the distinction madein the proposed andSection; 442.552(b) between clients who can cooperateand cannot cooperate in an evacuation is confusing and open to differentinterpretations. Another commenter did not feel that the proposed requirementfor three evacuation drills per year was satisfactory for clients who couldnot cooperate.Response: We have deleted in final regulations the reference to clientswho can and cannot cooperate. Instead, we are retaining the language ofcurrent regulations at andSection; 442.506 that require all clients actuallyto evacuate during at least one drill each year on each shift.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter indicated that fire drills should be unannounced.Response: Good practice dictates that actual, full drills be unannounced,since real emergencies (fire, tornadoes, gas clouds), are immediate andunexpected. However, in order to train staff and clients in evacuationprocedures, it is often necessary to practice evacuations without the elementof surprise. Thus, it is not possible or advisable simply to require thatall drills be unannounced. Rather, by requiring the drills, we meet LifeSafety Code requirements and still leave to the facility needed flexibilityin how the drills are accomplished.WW. Paint (Proposed andSection; 442.556; Final andSection; 483.470(k))<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that a new requirement statingthat clients cannot be housed in buildings that contain asbestos ceilingsor insulation be added to the proposed andSection; 442.556 that containedrequirements concerning lead paint.Response: We fully appreciate the importance of ensuring protection fromthe hazards of exposure to asbestos fibers within buildings. We note thatCongress also is concerned with this issue, as evidenced by its enactmentlast year of the Asbestos Hazards Emergency Response Act. This legislationestablished a program under which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)sets standards to inspect for, identify, and abate hazardous asbestos inschools. Congress is currently considering legislation that would directthe EPA to expand these activities to include nonschool buildings. In viewof this pending legislation, and EPA's experience and technical expertisein this area, we do not believe it would be appropriate for HCFA unilaterallyto impose its own standards on asbestos abatement.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested the proposed regulation be modifiedto state that paint or plaster containing lead must be removed rather than``removed or covered''.Response: We believe this suggestion would create an unnecessary hardshipon facilities. We believe that client safety and health will be assuredby requiring the facility either to remove or cover interior paint containinglead.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter indicated that in the past there was arequirement that paints be non-flammable, and asked if this requirementwas still applicable.Response: We were unable to locate a Federal ICF/MR regulation that prohibitedthe use of flammable paints.XX. Food and Nutrition Services (Proposed andSection; 442.558; Final andSection;483.480(a))<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters indicated that the proposed andSection;442.558(a) would unnecessarily restrict facilities because it would requirethat the facility actually provide each client with a nourishing, wellbalanced diet. They note that while clients are in ``day care'' programsthe facility cannot be held responsible for the food served.Response: We agree that emphasis should be placed on the client outcomeof receiving an appropriate diet rather than on the facility's provisionof it and have amended final regulations by indicating that each clientmust receive an adequate diet even though the facility does not provideit directly. However, responsibility for the food served to clients byoutside programs continues to remain with the ICF/MR, as the legally responsibleentity.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the regulation be modifiedto require a nourishing, well-balanced diet to ``meet the individual needsof the clients''.Response: We do not agree that addition of this phrase is necessary. Thefinal regulations at andSection; 483.480(a)(1) include language that statesthat ``each client must receive a nourishing, well-balanced diet''. A dietcannot be nourishing nor well balanced for each client unless his or herindividual needs have been addressed.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that a new section be added toindicate that if behavior modification programs include the use of food,such programs must be reviewed by a registered dietitian to assure provisionof a nutritional diet.Response: We agree with this comment and have revised final regulationsto include a provision at andSection; 483.480(a)(4) that requires the interdisciplinaryteam, including the physician and the dietitian to participate in decisionsthat include the provision of food as part of a program to manage inappropriateclient behavior.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that all facilities be requiredto maintain a current diet manual, and that the manual be approved by thedietitian and medical director and be kept in a convenient location foruse in preparing diets.Response: We believe this suggestion is too prescriptive and believe thatthe requirement stating that diets be prepared in accordance with the Foodand Nutrition Board of the National Research Council, National Academyof Sciences will help to assure the provision of nutritionally sound diets.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that the proposed requirementin andSection; 442.558 that would require diets to be prepared in accordancewith the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council be modifiedto provide flexibility for individual choice in food for those clientsin independent cooking programs.Response: These regulations do not preclude a facility from providing individualfood choice for clients participating in an independent cooking program.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter asked whether every facility would be requiredto obtain a copy of the dietary allowances of the Food and Nutrition Boardof the National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences.Response: If a facility can prepare meals in accordance with the standardsspecified without having a copy (for example, through its dietitian), thenit need not possess a copy.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter pointed out that the standards set by theFood and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council, National Academyof Sciences represent minimum guidelines and not a maximum, and that thenutritional needs of some clients may not be met by compliance with a minimumstandard.Response: We agree and have modified final regulations accordingly. Asamended, the language of the final rule at andSection; 483.480(a)(6) requiresthat diets must be prepared <T3>at least</T3> in accordance with the Food and Nutrition Board standards.<T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters expressed concern that the proposed regulationcontains no provisions regarding safety and sanitation in food storage,food preparation or food service.Response: We believe that these are issues that are well covered by existingState and local laws. Under the final regulations at andSection; 483.410(b),a facility is required to adhere to State and local laws; therefore, webelieve there is no need for the suggested change since it would be duplicative.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that the duties of the dietitianshould be expanded in this regulation to include being responsible forproviding annual nutrition assessments and conducting periodic follow-upmenu reviews, providing guidance to the food service operations, and beingincluded in the interdisciplinary assessment of client feeding problems.Response: There is nothing in this section that would preclude the dietitianfrom performing these functions; however, we believe it is best that eachfacility utilize personnel according to the facility's individual needs.<T3>Comment:</T3> A number of commenters expressed views about the proposedrequirement for physician and dietitian participation in decisions aboutmodified and special diets. One commenter wanted other appropriate teammembers to be involved in decisions about these diets, another questionedthe need for a physician and a dietitian to participate in these decisions,and another wanted the interdisciplinary team to make decisions about thesediets. Another commenter wanted the physician and dietitian to participatein decisions about the caloric levels and nutritional adequacy of diets.Finally, one commenter wanted the word ``participation'' to be definedin regulation and another wanted a definition of ``modified and specialdiets''.Response: We do not believe these regulations should specify who shoulddevelop modified and special diets as long as the physician and dietitianparticipate in those decisions. The physician's and dietitian's participationshould assure the necessary quality of modified and special diets, butwe do not believe it is necessary to regulate their involvement in caloriclevels. The facility as a whole is held responsible for nutritional adequacyas required by andSection; 442.558(a) of the proposed regulations. The words``participates in decisions about'' contained in proposed andSection; 442.558(b)have been deleted from final regulations. Instead, the final regulationsat andSection; 483.480(a)(4) now require the physician and dietitian, aspart of the interdisciplinary team, to prescribe all modified and specialdiets. Finally, we will define ``modified and special diets'' in the interpretiveguidelines as diets that are needed to enable the clients to eat (for example,food that is chopped, pureed, etc.) or diets that are intended to corrector prevent a nutritional deficiency or health problem.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that meals be developed by aFood and Nutrition Unit.Response: We do not believe it necessary to require a Food and NutritionUnit. However, there is nothing to preclude the establishment of a Foodand Nutrition Unit if an individual facility so desires.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that a dietitian-to-client ratiobe established in these standards.Response: We believe that to establish dietitian-to-client ratios wouldbe unnecessarily prescriptive.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter asked that the dietitian be a part of the``feeding team'' and another commenter asked that the dietitian be a partof the ``infection control team''.Response: The regulations do not require the establishment of either ofthese teams. However, if a facility chooses to establish such teams, thereis nothing that would preclude a dietitian's participation on these teams.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that the ``nutrition unit'' berequired to conduct nutrition education programs for direct care personnel,clients and their families.Response: Section 483.430(e) of final regulations mandates staff training.We believe that this requirement is sufficient to assure that staff istrained. There is nothing in this regulation that precludes the kind oftraining suggested by the commenter for clients and their families.YY. Meal Services (Proposed andSection; 442.560; Final andSection; 483.480(b))<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters objected to the proposed requirementat andSection; 442.560(a) for actually serving three meals a day to clients,since many clients eat lunch at day care programs.Response: We agree with these commenters and have modified final regulationsto incorporate language at andSection; 483.480(b)(1) that specifies thateach client must receive at least three meals each day. This would maintainthe facility's responsibility to see to it that clients receive three mealsa day without requiring them actually to serve the meals themselves.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters stated that the prohibition underandSection; 442.560(a)(1) of the proposed regulations that breakfast be servedno longer than 14 hours after the evening meal unnecessarily restrictedclients' eating habits on weekends and holidays. They noted that this requirementdid not allow clients to sleep in on weekends and holidays.Response: We agree with the comments and, while we have retained the 14hour meal span requirement, we have included in final regulations at andSection;483.480(b)(1) an exception allowing an extension to 16 hours on weekendsand holidays if a nourishing snack is served at bedtime.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters suggested a change to the proposedstandard that requires discarding food that has been served and uneaten.They wanted wording that would allow reuse of food served ``family style''.Response: We agree with this comment and have changed the final regulationsto include language at andSection; 483.480(b)(3) that requires that whenfood is served ``to clients individually'' it must be discarded.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter objected to the deletion in the proposedrule of a provision in current regulations that requires food to be servedunder sanitary conditions.Response: We of course agree that it is important that food be served undersanitary conditions; however, we believe this can best be accomplishedby relying on local and State laws. Section 442.416 of the proposed rule,now incorporated into andSection; 483.410(b) of final regulations requirescompliance with these laws.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that the proposed andSection; 442.560(b)regarding the serving of food be revised to require that food be servedin sufficient quality as well as quantity.Response: The issue of quality was dealt with in proposed section andSection;442.558 (final andSection; 483.480(a)) that requires a nourishing and wellbalanced diet for each client.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter proposed adding a new subsection that wouldmandate: attention being paid to clients' reasonable food preferences;maintaining records of each client's likes, dislikes, and food allergies;and observing each client to determine acceptance of diet.Response: While we believe that the ends sought in this comment are laudable,we believe that it is too prescriptive to specify these details in theregulations. We note, however, that the final rule at andSection; 483.440(c)(3)(v)requires that the comprehensive functional assessment of each client mustidentify the client's nutritional status.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested adding a new subsection (d) toproposed andSection; 442.560 pertaining to recipes, detailing the numberof clients to be served from each recipe and the methods used in recipepreparation to assure nutritional value, texture, flavor and appearance,etc.Response: We believe these suggestions are too prescriptive in nature tobe beneficial.ZZ. Menus (Proposed andSection; 442.562; Final andSection; 483.480(c))<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter stated that the provision in proposed andSection;442.562 to include average portion sizes for menu items was not necessary.Response: We do not believe this requirement should be deleted since itcan be used as a tool to help determine adequacy of diet.<T3>Comment:</T3> Three commenters indicated that we should require thatmenus be prepared at least one week in advance of their usage.Response: We believe this to be overly prescriptive in nature. This isan area where the facility should have flexibility.<T3>Comment:</T3> Four commenters wanted a requirement for menu approvalby a dietitian for nutritional adequacy and for therapeutic correctionsof modified diets.Response: We believe that the concerns addressed in this comment are addressedin proposed andSection; 442.558, Food and Nutrition Services that requiresdiets to be nourishing and well-balanced and requires a dietitian and aphysician to participate in decisions about modified and special diets.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter indicated the desire to see a prohibitionagainst ``fast food/junk food'' appearing on the menu.Response: The requirement contained at the proposed andSection; 442.558(a)(final andSection; 483.480(a)) that would mandate that each client receivenourishing, well-balanced meals to assure that clients' dietary needs aremet. Whether the foods are considered ``fast or junk foods'' is not a concernso long as the client is receiving a nutritious and well-balanced diet.Therefore, we have not made this change.<T3>Comment:</T3> The remainder of the commenters on this section suggesteda variety of additions. One wanted retention of an existing regulationrequiring the facility to maintain food purchase records. Another wantedmenus to be posted in cooking and serving areas. One commenter wanted aregulation on between-meal feedings. Another commenter wanted a sectionstipulating that modified diets be accurately written and correctly served.Finally, one commenter suggested greater flexibility for clients trainedin food purchases and preparations.Response: We have not modified the proposed regulations to incorporatethese comments. It is our view that these requirements are too restrictive,and that sufficient client protections relative to these issues are alreadycontained in the final regulations at andSection; 483.480 and other sectionsof the final rule.AAA. Dining Areas and Service (Proposed andSection; 442.564; Final andSection;483.480(d))<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that the proposed requirementfor provision of table service to all clients who can and will eat at atable be changed to encompass several levels of client functioning.Response: We do not believe the regulation should be modified to designatetable service classifications by client functional status. Clients of grosslydifferent ages, developmental levels and social needs generally are notallowed to be housed together (see final regulations at andSection; 483.470(a)(1)).We do not believe it necessary to extend this requirement to table serviceas well.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that a new subsection be addedthat would require the facility to provide enough staff trained in appropriatefeeding techniques and client positioning.Response: The final regulations at andSection; 483.430 (c) through (e) alreadymake provisions for sufficient staff and for the training of that staff.We believe these requirements adequately address these issues.<T3>Comment:</T3> Section andSection; 442.564 of the proposed rule wouldrequire the facility to serve meals to clients in dining areas unless otherwisespecified by the interdisciplinary team or a physician. Two commenterssuggested that a dietitian also be allowed to exempt clients from thisgeneral rule. Another commenter wanted physicians deleted from the list.Response: We have not changed this standard. The fundamental reason a clientwould not eat in a dining area relates to the existence of a medical careplan or because of a behavioral or developmental problem that either theinterdisciplinary team or the physician would have knowledge of. If theproblem relates to a significant dietary problem, the dietitian would beon the interdisciplinary team as a consequence of that problem and wouldprovide input by that means.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter believes that the provision in currentregulations andSection; 442.472(c) requiring clients to eat in an uprightposition, unless medically contraindicated, should be retained.Response: Our final regulations at andSection; 483.480(d)(2) require thefacility to provide table service to all clients that can and will eatat a table. They also require at andSection; 483.480(d)(1) that the facilityserve all clients in dining areas unless exceptions are made by the interdisciplinaryteam or a physician. It was our intent that these provisions should besufficient to assure that clients are fed in an upright position unlessmedically contraindicated. however, to ensure that our intent is clearlyunderstood, we have mentioned it explicitly in the final rule at andSection;483.480(d)(5).<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested a new standard be establishedfor food service sanitation that would indicate that sanitary standardsmust be in compliance with State and local laws.Response: Such a standard would be redundant since andSection; 483.410(b)of the final regulations requires that facilities must be in compliancewith all applicable provisions of Federal, State and local laws pertainingto health, sanitation, safety and research.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter prescribed a series of requirements thata facility's diet services must include. Among these were requirementsrelating to specifications for supplies and equipment, standards to assureproper storage of food, and other health and safety features.Response: In general, we believe these requirements would be too prescriptiveand would unnecessarily interfere with the effective management of thefacility. Additionally, those suggestions relating to food storage andfood health issues are best addressed, we believe, by State and local enforcementof applicable regulations and laws. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that paragraph (a) of the proposedandSection; 442.564 should be more flexible since not all meals are servedin dining areas; for example, picnics and parties. Response: We will specify in interpretive guidelines that on special occasionssuch as picnics and parties, clients would not have to be served in established``dining areas''. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Provisions of the Final Rule </ITAG>We are adopting the provisions set forth in the NPRM with the exceptionof the changes noted in the ``Discussion of Comments'' (section III above),including the reorganization of the proposed standards into a conditionformat and the redesignation of these as a new Part 483. As a result ofadopting the conditions format and the redesignation, we are making severalconforming changes thoughout the regulations. We also are making many technicaland clarifying changes. The conforming changes that we are making will change references to thestandards for ICFs/MR to read ``conditions of participation''. These changesare located at andSection;andSection; 442.117, 442.118, 442.119 and 442.254.Other conforming changes at andSection;andSection; 440.150, 442.30, 442.100,442.101, 442.105, 442.117, and 442.254 will reflect the move from Part442, Subpart G to Part 483, Subpart D. We also are making changes to clarify our policies concerning provideragreements and facility certifications. In andSection; 442.13(c), we areadding language to clarify that it is acceptable for a provider to submita correction plan only if it meets any applicable conditions of participation.This is consistent with our policy that under conditions of participation,a provider agreement may not be entered into with a facility that has deficienciesat the condition-level. A facility may obtain a provider agreement undercertain circumstances with deficiencies at the standard-level. We alsoare revising andSection;andSection; 442.101, 442.105 and 442.110 to clarifythat a facility may be certified by the survey agency with deficienciesat the standard-level only. (Note: Section 442.110 was previously andSection;442.111. HSQ-127-F, Correction and Reduction plans for Intermediate CareFacilities for the Mentally Retarded (53 FR 1984) redesignated the section.)We are further revising andSection; 442.101 (d) and (e) to clarify whichsubparts contained the requirements that each type of facility (that is,SNFs, ICFs and ICFs/MR) must meet. In many cases, the regulations use the phrase ``Federal standards'' ina general sense; that is, the phrase refers to both standards and conditionsof participation. In order to avoid confusion and to maintain the distinctionbetween standards and conditions of participation, we are changing severalof these general references to ``requirements''. These changes are locatedat andSection;andSection; 431.610, 442.13, 442.14, 442.16. and 442.30. We alsoare deleting the general reference to standards used, and intermediatecare facilities for the mentally retarded in andSection; 442.1. That sectionrefers to requirements for facility certification which we believe encompassesfacility standards and conditions of participation. Additionally, throughout the proposed regulation, we included languagethat stated that ``The facility must provide * * *'' or ``The facilitymust develop * * *''. In this final rule, we have changed that languagein many instances to ``Each client must receive * * *''. We believe thatthis change clarifies our intent to emphasize client needs. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Impact Statement </ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291 Executive Order (E.O.) 12291 requires us to prepare and publish a finalregulatory impact analysis for any final rule that meets one of the E.O.criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely to result.While we believe that the regulations will accomplish these results, forseveral reasons we are not able to state the economic impact in quantitativeterms. First, current cost reporting requirements do not provide data brokendown by cost centers that would allow us to determine the impact of eitherour present or future health and safety requirements on facility expenditures.Second, ascribing cost of care is difficult because of the variations amongfacilities in terms of facility size and type, and diversity in per diemrates within a State. Third, the variety of client characteristics makesit difficult to ascribe costs of care based on these characteristics. Nonetheless, we have found no available data or analyses that indicatethat these changes would have an annual economic impact of $100 million,or meet the other thresholds specified in the Executive Order. For thesereasons, we have determined that a regulatory impact analysis is not required.B. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Introduction </ITAG>We generally prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistentwith the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unlessthe Secretary certifies that a final regulation will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposesof the RFA, we treat all ICFs/MR as small entities. Because many facilitiesmay be significantly affected by these final regulations, we have preparedthe following regulatory flexibility analysis.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Affected Entities </ITAG>As of December 1986, there were about 3,660 certified ICFs/MR ranging insize from four to approximately 1500 beds, as follows: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s20,10,10</C> <H1>Number of beds </H1><H1>Number of ICFs/MR </H1><H1>Percent of total</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">4 to 15 <D>2,785 </D><D>76 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">16 to 100 <D>754 </D><D>21 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Over 100 <D>121 </D><D>3</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total </ITAG><D>3,660 </D><D>100</D></ITAG> Nonprofit ICFs/MR comprise about 54 percent of certified ICFs/MR, for-profitfacilities about 23 percent, and governmental facilities about 24 percent.We expect restructuring of the requirements in this regulation will havea substantial effect on facility performance. These revised regulationsde-emphasize paper work and focus on the active treatment of clients. Initially,facilities may experience more deficiency findings from surveys. However,we do not expect more terminations to result because we expect facilityperformance to change in ways that would improve compliance and qualityof care. Although we anticipate significant changes on the part of facilities asthey focus more on the provision of active treatment to clients, we donot expect a substantial increase in their costs. By publishing these rules,we are giving facilities both the notice and the incentive to refocus theirattention. Under these provisions, as under the existing rules and surveyprotocols, deficiencies will commonly result in plans of correction thatafford an adequate opportunity for facilities to come into compliance.The new rules will create the opportunity and the incentive for facilitiesto reallocate their resources more efficiently and effectively, thus increasingemphasis on the provision of active treatment. We believe that affected facilities will benefit by the new conditionsof participation because of the reduced paperwork burdens and costs, andincreased administrative flexibility. While some paperwork is legally andprogrammatically necessary and important, much of it is performed onlyto meet specific and discrete requirements specified in current regulations.The final regulations' emphasis on staff and client performance, ratherthan paper compliance, could reduce the production of paper significantlyin some of the large public facilities. However, State licensing requirementsand internal facility policies and practices, by retaining some of thesame requirements, may also affect the extent to which potential savingsare realized under these conditions. There is an established trend to smaller ICFs (that is, facilities withfewer than 16 beds). These regulations afford these facilities the flexibilitythey need to operate more effectively. While these facilities will benefitfrom reduced paperwork and increased focus on client outcomes, becauseof their size they typically experience fewer of the administrative andprogrammatic problems in delivering and accounting for services to clientswhich result from the prescriptive, generally inflexible standards containedin the current regulations. Specific provisions of this regulation which may significantly affect individualfacilities include: (a) Physician services_To the extent allowed by State law, physician assistants(PAs) and nurse practitioners (NPs) may perform physician functions. Thisprovision could result in significant savings for those facilities thatcan use PAs and NPs for routine health care. (b) Nursing personnel_Those facilities that serve 16 or fewer persons andthat do not now require professional nursing services will be requiredto arrange for nursing personnel to conduct an in-person health reviewof each client at least quarterly. This may represent an increased costover present requirements for affected facilities because we cannot calculatethe expected offset in savings that will occur under these conditions.However, this requirement will be balanced by a decrease in costs becausefacilities that serve 16 or more clients, none of whom have a medical careplan ordered by a physician, will not need a licensed nurse on duty.(c) Dental services_The new provisions make explicit that which was alwaysintended; that is, comprehensive dental treatment including emergency careand annual check-ups are required. Some facilities may experience a costincrease, depending on the extent to which they have met the existing standards.(d) Client bedrooms (floor to ceiling walls)_For facilities initially certified,or in buildings constructed or with major renovations or conversions onor after October 3, 1988, walls must extend from the floor to the ceilingbetween living quarters. Clients benefit by increased privacy and a slightdegree of increased safety by the containment of possible spreading fires.Since this provision reflects state-of-the-art design and constructionpractices, we expect the economic impact of this requirement on new facilitiesplanning to come into the program to be negligible. Very few new facilitiesplanning to come into the program would not already meet this requirement.Although the requirement for floor to ceiling walls would have an economicimpact on facilities undergoing major renovation or conversion, we do notanticipate that many facilities will be affected due to the trend towardsmaller facilities. (e) Client bedrooms (variance to the four-to-a-bedroom rule)_This regulationlimits the conditions under which a facility can claim variance to therule that no more than four persons may be allowed per bedroom. Only physiciansmay order this arrangement for clients with severe health problems thatrequire continuous monitoring during sleeping hours. For those facilitiesthat have relied on this variance in existing standards, this provisionmay represent significant increased capital expenditures. Alternatively,facilities (or buildings) affected could face the loss of certificationin the ICF/MR program.(f) Laboratory services_These final regulations will require that ICFs/MRthat choose to provide directly inhouse laboratory services must now meetthe requirements of andSection; 483.460(n). We had stated in the NPRM thatwe had identified 110 public ICFs/MR that used inhouse labs and that wouldbe affected by this provision. A more recent survey showed 80 ICFs/MR thatoperate their own labs. We believe the difference may be because separatelabs in other than ICFs/MR were not included in the more recent survey.We are unable to determine the economic impact upon these ICFs/MR becausethese labs have not been surveyed previously and we do not know to whatextent they would meet the requirements of these final rules. However,we believe that any impact upon the ICFs/MR resulting from an attempt tomeet these requirements would be offset by increased accuracy of testingand quality of care received by the facility's clients.(g) Use of interdisciplinary team_We expect that provisions specifyingan interdisciplinary team to coordinate and establish one plan of treatmentper client will result in increased quality of care and reduced administrativeburden. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Effect on Clients</ITAG>We expect that clients will benefit by better quality of care, by moreattention to clients' rights, and by more opportunity for self determination.The net result of these revised regulations will be to focus much moreattention on the active treatment of individual clients. Instead of multipletreatment plans developed and implemented by different disciplines, therewill be a single treatment plan coordinated and integrated by one interdisciplinaryteam. The individual treatment plan will establish client objectives andset priorities for those objectives into a meaningful progression of treatmentactivities and programs with a single professional, the qualified mentalretardation professional directly furnishing services for the facility,in charge. Client rights have been made more explicit by clearly statingin positive language the rights that each client has and by establishingexplicit standards for staff treatment of clients that reaffirm each ofthese clients' rights. C. ConclusionThe actual impact on an individual ICF/MR would represent the extent ofthe incremental difference between a facility's current level of compliancewith our regulations and the effort and cost, if any, required to meetthese revisions. Overall, we believe that most facilities will be ableto improve performance at lower cost and will have greater flexibilityto administer their programs. As explained above, smaller facilities alreadyhave substantial flexibility, so that the net gain is not expected to besubstantial for most of these facilities. Nonetheless, we expect that thequality of care in smaller facilities will be enhanced.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI.
