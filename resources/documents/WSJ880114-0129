Across the country, says Kirk O'Donnell, a Democratic strategist, &quot;there's a feeling of uncertainty and shakiness.&quot;    Of the 13 candidates for president, Democratic and Republican, Vice President George Bush, they all agree, had the best year in 1987. But Mr. Bush, they say, is a weak candidate.    It isn't a pretty picture these three sages painted at the first in a series of lunches to be held by The Wall Street Journal to discuss how the 1988 campaign is progressing. (A fourth strategist, Republican John Sears, was called away suddenly on business.)    Mr. Hart, leading off in analyzing the Democratic race, says he is disappointed that the party's seven candidates &quot;have never gained the stature one would have hoped they would have started to achieve by this time.&quot; But he and the other Democrat, Mr. O'Donnell, think there's still time for someone to emerge who could win in November.    The three strategists foresee two possible Democratic scenarios.    The first, outlined by Mr. Phillips, grows out of a belief that the re-entry of former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado into the race may be more of a plus than a minus for the rest of the field. &quot;By getting back into the race,&quot; says Mr. Phillips, &quot;he (Mr. Hart) created the opportunity for some other Democratic candidate to slay the horny dragon.&quot; If someone slays Mr. Hart in Iowa or New Hampshire, he emerges instantly as the party's St. George.    Mr. Phillips thinks two Democrats, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois and Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, have the best chance to slay the dragon. Mr. O'Donnell thinks Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, whom he sees gaining in Iowa, should be added to the list. &quot;It's all up for grabs,&quot; he says. One possible weakness with the scenario: Mr. Hart may turn out to be a dragon without much fire, so slaying him wouldn't be widely perceived as much of an accomplishment.    The second scenario projects Sen. Albert Gore Jr., of Tennessee as a likely winner. Mr. Gore is concentrating his campaign in his native South and especially in the 14 southern and border states taking part in caucuses and primaries on March 8, Super Tuesday. It would be helpful to his strategy, the sages say, if someone didn't come roaring down from Iowa and New Hampshire as the St. George who slayed Mr. Hart. &quot;Gore has to hope the whole thing stays confused until Super Tuesday,&quot; says Mr. Phillips.    But Mr. Hart, the poll taker, enters another factor -- the Rev. Jesse Jackson.    &quot;On Jackson,&quot; he says, &quot;watch out. He has more support than most people recognize and it isn't confined totally to the black community. I think you can take any one of the southern states and add 10% of the white vote (to the black vote) and you're looking at someone who could win 30% of the vote. It's significant.&quot;    All the experts see Sen. Gore doing better than they had expected earlier. Mr. Hart says he once thought &quot;the only way Gore could make it is going through Des Moines and Manchester (N.H.), but I don't believe that anymore. Events may come to Gore -- and he may be perfectly situated to do very well in the South.&quot;    Mr. Hart notes there are three weeks between New Hampshire and Super Tuesday, days that will be cluttered with polling data. Those polls might well show Mr. Jackson leading in the South, galvanizing white southerners to rally around Mr. Gore.    Mr. O'Donnell is impressed by Mr. Gore too. &quot;I think Gore is the easiest one to picture moving right through and winning the presidency,&quot; he says. Mr. Phillips, the Republican strategist, thinks the GOP ought to begin cutting down Mr. Gore now by &quot;describing him as a spoiled rich kid from St. Alban's (prep school) who smoked marijuana and had a soft job in Vietnam.&quot;    The strategists believe there is still a possibility someone else -- most likely Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York -- could jump into the race. The odds are 1 in 4, according to Mr. Hart; 1 in 6, according to Mr. Phillips; and 1 in 10, according to Mr. O'Donnell.    On the Republican side, the three strategists believe Vice President Bush has done somewhat better than they expected and that Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, his chief opponent, has done a lot worse.    &quot;If you look at 1988 and see what the voters want,&quot; says pollster Hart, &quot;Dole is the next president. Dole's problem is that he continually runs the wrong campaign and doesn't even run it well.&quot;    &quot;Dole's engaging in personality attacks (on Mr. Bush),&quot; says Mr. O'Donnell, &quot;and that reflects frustration in the campaign.&quot; He says the Dole campaign manager, former Labor Secretary William Brock, &quot;should have shaped it up better.&quot;    Mr. Phillips says Sen. Dole should be the candidate, arguing that he is the one capable of mastering all the complex and difficult issues the country will face over the next four years. Mr. Bush, he says, gives no sense he can &quot;provide any snap, crackle or pop. Dole is better equipped than anyone and he hasn't taken advantage of it.&quot;    And so, says Mr. Phillips, the contest between the two men focuses more and more on personality. Each, he says, is convinced the other has weaknesses that &quot;can be exposed by applying pressure.&quot;    The strategists generally discount the other contenders, and Mr. Phillips says he believes the other preacher in the race, Pat Robertson, already is beginning to fade.    The three sages agree the election will turn on the economy, and that is where change has occurred and where unpredictable events are bound to happen.    &quot;We still have an uncertain nation,&quot; says Mr. Hart. &quot;The stock market decline was a real shock in terms of general confidence.&quot; In one of his own polls, 11% of the respondents said they were confident about the future; 44% said they were worried.    &quot;The crash has redefined the whole campaign,&quot; says Mr. O'Donnell. &quot;It is a condition the Democrats should be able to take advantage of. But they've been unable so far to do so.&quot;    They might, says Mr. Phillips, except for their &quot;double-digit economic IQs.&quot;    Mr. Phillips thinks the Republicans can survive if they &quot;stay afloat and keep all the balls in the air.&quot; Policy, he notes, is being set for the first time by a former campaign manager -- Treasury Secretary James Baker, onetime campaign manager for Mr. Bush.    &quot;I would almost regard the central banks of the G-7 countries as unregistered Republican political action commitees,&quot; says Mr. Phillips. &quot;They are absolutely central to the continuation of this economic high-wire act.&quot;    At an earlier session six months ago, John Sears, the strategist who couldn't make it this time, predicted that by the time the party conventions roll around &quot;the pollsters will all look bad&quot; and journalists will be scrambling to explain where they went wrong.    Little has happened since to upset that prediction. </TEXT></DOC>
