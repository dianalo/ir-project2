The department had been scheduled to choose by year endbetween competing designs by two consortiums; one group isheaded by Ebasco Services Inc., a subsidiary of Enserch Corp.of Dallas, and the other by General Atomics.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This should in no way be seen as a decision not to build&quot;a reactor to produce tritium, a perishable radioactive gasthat boosts the explosive power of nuclear weapons, EnergySecretary James Watkins said in a statement.   The U.S. government has been without a reactor to producetritium since its Savannah River, S.C., plants were shut downin 1988 for safety reasons. But the postCold War era hasreduced the urgency of replenishing the tritium stockpile;also, plans for disarmament increase the amount of tritiumthat can be reused from weapons taken out of service.   The department will now merge planning for a new reactorwith long-range plans for modernizing the country's entirenuclear weapons complex in light of Soviet and U.S. nuclearreductions.   James DeFrancis, an Ebasco vice president, said the delaywouldn't impede plans to begin construction by early 1994 aslong as Congress continues funding design work on theprojects. Plans have called for the reactor to come on linein the year 2000. In the interim, the department plans to useone of its Savannah River reactors, which it hopes to restartby the year end.   The Ebasco consortium, which is designing a heavy-waterreactor, comprises Combustion Engineering Inc.; Babcock andamp;Wilcox Industries Ltd., a subsidiary of McDermottInternational Inc.; Westinghouse Electric Corp.; RockwellInternational Corp.; Battelle Memorial Institute, and SulzerBrothers Ltd. If their design is chosen, the reactor would bebuilt by Bechtel Inc.   The General Atomics group, which is pursuing a new designcalling for a modular, high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor,includes Combustion Engineering Inc., Stone andamp; WebsterEngineering Co., and Burns andamp; Roe Co. Its reactor would bebuilt by Fluor Daniel Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
