The energy concern also reported a 57% jump in first-quarter earnings from continuing operations to $75.5 million, or $1.42 a share, from $48.2 million, or 81 cents a share, restated for an accounting change. Revenue rose 11% to $1.77 billion from $1.59 billion.    After a $6.1 million charge, first-quarter net income was $69.4 million, or $1.29 a share, up 11% from a restated $62.7 million, or $1.06 a share, including a $14.5 million loss from discontinued operations.    &quot;Based upon prices paid in recent transactions for oil and gas reserves,&quot; said Kenneth L. Lay, chairman and chief executive officer, &quot;the sale . . . would strengthen substantially Enron's financial position and provide the flexibility to pursue very attractive opportunities we see in the energy business.&quot; A spokesman for the company said that currently Enron has no specific investment &quot;opportunities&quot; in mind.    The company wouldn't say how much it thinks its oil and gas business is worth, but Mr. Lay said that the segment's value &quot;hasn't been adequately reflected in the price of Enron's common stock.&quot; Yesterday, Enron closed at $40.50, up $2.625, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    Enron Oil andamp; Gas Co. subsidiary is the third-largest independent oil and gas company in the U.S., Enron said. At year end, the company had reserves of 1.42 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 42.3 million barrels of oil. The oil and gas operations account for more than 25% of Enron's total assets. </TEXT></DOC>
