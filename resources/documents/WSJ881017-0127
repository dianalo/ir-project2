The technology, known as integrated services digital network or ISDN, has been slow to catch on. But the three partners in the Ameritech venture -- a telephone company, a communications equipment maker and a telephone switch manufacturer -- are counting on their collaboration to yield more than insights into real-world applications. The four-year agreement is aimed at developing services as well as the equipment and software needed to make those services attractive to a large number of businesses.    Unlike most experiments by other telephone companies and large business users to identify uses for the ISDN concept, the Ameritech venture will concentrate on &quot;enterprise integration.&quot; Using computer and communications systems to link such operations as sales, service, marketing and engineering, a business customer could improve productivity and reduce time spent on a variety of tasks from product design to customer service, said David Morgan, Motorola's director of computer and communications research and development.    Martin Johanson, senior director of marketing for Ameritech Services, said the experiments might also lead to applications for the health-care industry, education and municipal governments. Eventually, he said, sophisticated services linking communications equipment and computers could be offered to small businesses.    Within a year, Ameritech and Motorola expect to begin introducing applications of the technology and products that would enable customers to use the integrated services digital network.    Through its Illinois Bell unit, Chicago-based Ameritech will provide the phone network and the capabilities Motorola will need throughout the Chicago area for its ISDN experiments. Motorola, in turn, will test products and services in a new laboratory at its headquarters in Schaumburg, Ill. It will also make and market communications equipment that businesses need for ISDN applications. Northern Telecom, meanwhile, is supplying the switch that is used for the new services.    Some large telephone users are already experimenting with the new technology to streamline communications in such areas as engineering and marketing. The technology allows design engineers and manufacturing engineers, for example, to look at the same data at the same time and make changes that both would see simultaneously on their computer screens -- even though the two were working in facilities many miles apart.    Mr. Morgan said the idea is to &quot;experiment with the concept and what kind of equipment we can make for customers.&quot; Even as it was setting up the trial, he said, Motorola identified at least one piece of special equipment a customer might need to tap the new technology. </TEXT></DOC>
