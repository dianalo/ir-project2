The African Development Bank is designing a plan with the London merchant bank S.G. Warburg andamp; Co. under which the debt of sub-Saharan African countries could be converted into marketable securities, said Arnie Nachmanoff, a senior Warburg official.    The proposed securities would carry below-market interest rates and could be swapped for equity investments at the lenders' option. The plan also incorporates a sinking fund, Mr. Nachmanoff said. This fund, which would be controlled by an independent trustee, would receive a slice of debt-service payments, thus ensuring that maturing debt is at least partly repaid.    Sheik Ibrahim Fall, a senior member of the African Development Bank staff, said he is enthusiastic about the plan. But some bank creditors wonder if the plan can work for Africa, when creditors a few weeks ago blocked a similar, but more radical, proposal by Brazil. Warburg also helped draw up that proposal.    So far, progress toward more help for sub-Saharan Africa has been limited at the annual meeting this week of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Despite earlier hopes, there isn't yet any agreement among creditor countries on reducing interest rates on the debt of the poorest African countries.    &quot;It has proved most difficult for other creditor countries to accept,&quot; said Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson, one of the few officials from creditor nations to urge a reduction in interest rates to below market levels for poor African debtors. U.S. officials generally say they don't like the precedents such action would set for other big debtors, particularly the Latin American nations.    Furthermore, there isn't yet any firm agreement on how to increase the IMF's so-called structural adjustment facility by the $6 billion requested by IMF managing director Michel Camdessus. An increase in the facility, which currently totals $3 billion, would allow the IMF to provide more funds at longer maturities, particularly to poor countries in Africa.    So far though, only France and Canada have pledged specific sums to increasing this facility. The U.S. says it supports the increase but that the &quot;surplus countries&quot; -- nations with substantial current-account surpluses, namely Japan and West Germany -- should bear the brunt of the increase. Britain, which also says it supports the projected increase, says it will put up money provided others do too.    Bankers and other creditors attending this year's annual meetings agree that more should be done to alleviate sub-Saharan Africa's debt problems. But for the most part they are preoccupied with Brazil and other big debtors.    Treasury Secretary James Baker's debt strategy targets 15 heavily indebted countries for special attention, but only three of them are African countries -- Nigeria, Morocco and the Ivory Coast, which are among the less poor countries on that continent. Mr. Baker has tended to concentrate attention in his speeches on the Latin American debtors.    Part of Africa's problem is that it doesn't owe its creditors enough money to command their attention. Altogether the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, excluding South Africa, owes a bit more than $100 billion abroad, which is about what Mexico alone owes abroad and is only a small fraction of what Latin America as a whole owes its foreign creditors.    But the continent is attracting some officials' comments. President Reagan in his speech to the annual meeting blamed much of Africa's &quot;misery and decline&quot; on &quot;statist development models.&quot; But, the president said that a growing commitment to economic reform in such countries as Senegal, Ghana, Cameroon and Malawi raised hope that the continent may be turning the corner.    After a lengthy discourse on Latin America and other so-called middle-income debtors, World Bank President Barber Conable turned to Africa in his speech to the annual meeting. He said he hopes to mobilize $1.5 billion in additional resources for 15 highly indebted low-income countries in the years 1988 through 1990.    ---         Sub-Saharan Africa's Major Debtor Nations        As of Dec. 31, 1986, in billions of dollars                            GROSS        DEBT OWED                            EXTERNAL     COMMERCIAL                            DEBT         BANKS          Nigeria           $23.4        $11.0          Ivory Coast         9.4          3.3          Sudan               7.8*         1.2          Zaire               7.0          0.9          Zambia              6.0          0.4          Kenya               5.0          0.5          Cameroon            4.2          1.1   *As of Dec. 31, 1985   Sources: Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.; The Institute ofInternational Finance.</TEXT></DOC>
