These amendments related to installmentmethod reporting by dealers in personal property and were proposed to reflectthe addition of section 453A to the Code by the Installment Sales RevisionAct of 1980 (Pub. L. No. 96-471, 94 Stat. 2247). A public hearing was notheld as no written requests for a public hearing were received with respectto the proposed amendments. Accordingly, this Treasury Decision adoptsthe proposed amendments with the two changes discussed below and certainother minor revisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Availability of the Installment Method</ITAG>Section 10202 of the Revenue Act of 1987 (Pub. L. No. 100-203, 101 Stat.1330) amended the rules relating to installment sales by dealers. The amendment,which applies to obligations arising from dispositions made after December31, 1987, provides that sections 453A and 453C shall not apply (with certainexceptions) to dealer dispositions of personal and real property. Accordingly,the final regulations provide that sales by a dealer may be treated assales on the installment plan only for sales made on or before December31, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="84">Revolving Credit Sales</ITAG>Section 812 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. No. 99-514, 100 Stat.2085) amended the rules relating to sales under a revolving credit plan.The amendment, which applies for taxable years beginning after December31, 1986, provides that section 453A shall not apply to any dispositionof personal property under a revolving credit plan and that all paymentsto be received with respect to such dispositions are to be treated as receivedin the year of disposition. Accordingly, the final regulations providethat sales under a revolving credit plan may be treated as sales on theinstallment plan only for taxable years beginning on or before December31, 1986.<ITAG tagnum="84">Income to be Reported</ITAG>The proposed regulations inadvertently omitted portions of former andSection;1.453-3 that should have been included in the regulations under section453A. The omitted paragraphs, relating to determinations of the amountof income to be reported, other permissible accounting methods, and recordkeepingrequirements, have been included in andSection; 1.453A-1 of the final regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses</ITAG>It has been determined that this final rule is not a major rule as definedin Executive Order 12291. Therefore, a Regulatory Impact Analysis is notrequired. It has also been determined that section 553 (b) of the AdministrativeProcedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, afinal Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal author of these regulations is Paulette C.

Under the installmentmethod of accounting, a taxpayer may return as income from installmentsales in any taxable year that proportion of the installment payments actuallyreceived in that year which the gross profit realized or to be realizedwhen the property is paid for bears to the total contract price. For thispurpose, gross profit means sales less cost of goods sold. See paragraph(d) of this section for additional rules relating to the computation ofincome under the installment method of accounting. In addition, see andSection;1.453A-2 for rules treating revolving credit plans as installment plansfor taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 1986. (b) <T3>Effect of security.</T3> A dealer may adopt (but is not required todo so) one of the following four ways of protecting against loss in caseof default by the purchaser: (1) An agreement that title is to remain in the vendor until performanceof the purchaser's part of the transaction is completed; (2) A form of contract in which title is conveyed to the purchaser immediately,but subject to a lien for the unpaid portion of the selling price; (3) A present transfer of title to the purchaser, who at the same timeexecutes a reconveyance in the form of a chattel mortgage to the vendor;or (4) A conveyance to a trustee pending performance of the contract andsubject to its provisions. (c) <T3>Definitions of dealer, sale, and sale on the installment plan.</T3>For purposes of the regulations under section 453A_ (1) The term ``dealer'' means a person who regularly sells or otherwisedisposes of personal property on the installment plan; (2) The term ``sale'' includes sales and other dispositions; and (3) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the term ``saleon the installment plan'' means_ (i) A sale of personal property by the taxpayer under any plan for thesale of personal property, which plan, by its terms and conditions, contemplatesthat each sale under the plan will be paid for in two or more payments;or (ii) A sale of personal property by the taxpayer under any plan for thesale of personal property_ (A) Which plan, by its terms and conditions, contemplates that such salewill be paid for in two or more payments; and (B) Which sale is in fact paid for in two or more payments. (d) <T3>Installment plans</T3>_(1)<T3> Traditional installment plans.</T3> A traditional installment planusually has the following characteristics: (i) The execution of a separate installment contract for each sale ordisposition of personal property; and (ii) The retention by the dealer of some type of security interest insuch property.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Normally, a sale under a traditional installment plan meets the requirementsof paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. (2) <T3>Revolving credit plans. </T3>Sales under a revolving credit plan (withinthe meaning of andSection; 1.453A-2(c)(1))_ (i) Are treated, for taxable years beginning on or before December 31,1986, as sales on the installment plan to the extent provided in andSection;1.453A-2, which provides for the application of the requirements of paragraph(c)(3)(ii) of this section to sales under revolving credit plans; and (ii) Are not treated as sales on the installment plan for taxable yearsbeginning after December 31, 1986. (e) <T3>Installment income of dealers in personal property</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>The income from sales on the installment plan of adealer may be ascertained by treating as income that proportion of thetotal payments received in the taxable year from sales on the installmentplan (such payments being allocated to the year against the sales of whichthey apply) which the gross profit realized or to be realized on the totalsales on the installment plan made during each year bears to the totalcontract price of all such sales made during that respective year. However,if the dealer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the district directorthat income from sales on the installment plan is clearly reflected, theincome from such sales may be ascertained by treating as income that proportionof the total payments received in the taxable year from sales on the installmentplan (such payments being allocated to the year against the sales of whichthey apply) which either: (i) The gross profit realized or to be realized on the total credit salesmade during each year bears to the total contract price of all credit salesduring that respective year, or (ii) The gross profit realized or to be realized on all sales made duringeach year bears to the total contract price of all sales made during thatrespective year. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">A dealer who desires to compute income by the installment method shallmaintain accounting records in such a manner as to enable an accurate computationto be made by such method in accordance with the provisions of this section,section 446, and andSection; 1.446-1. (2) <T3>Gross profit and total contract price. </T3>For purposes of paragraph(e)(1) of this section, in computing the gross profit realized or to berealized on the total sales on the installment plan, there shall be includedin the total selling price and, thus, in the total contract price of allsuch sales. (i) The amount of carrying charges or interest which is determined at thetime of each sale and is added to the established cash selling price ofsuch property and is treated as part of the selling price for customerbilling purposes, and (ii) In the case of sales made in taxable years beginning on or after January1, 1960, the amount of carrying charges or interest determined with respectto such sales which are added contemporaneously with the sale on the booksof account of the seller but are treated as periodic service charges forcustomer billing purposes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Any change in the amount of the carrying charges or interest in ayear subsequent to the sale will not affect the computation of the grossprofit for the year of sale but will be taken into account at the timethe carrying charges or interest are adjusted. The application of thisparagraph (e)(2) to carrying charges or interest described in paragraph(e)(2)(ii) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example. </T3> X Corporation makes sales on the traditional installmentplan. The customer's order specifies that the total price consists of acash price plus a ``time price differential'' of 1\1/2\ percent per monthon the outstanding balance in the customer's account, and the customeris billed in this manner. On its books and for purposes of reporting tostockholders, X Corporation consistently makes the following entries eachmonth when it records its sales. A debit entry is make to accounts receivable(for the total price) and balancing credit entries are made to sales (forthe established selling price) and to a reserve account for collectionexpense (for the amount of the time price differential). In computing thegross profit realized or to be realized on the total sales on the installmentplan, the total selling price and, thus, the total contract price for purposesof this paragraph (e) would, with respect to sales made in taxable yearsbeginning on or after January 1, 1960, include the time price differential.</ITAG>(3) <T3>Carrying charges not included in total contract price.</T3> In thecase of sales by dealers in personal property made during taxable yearsbeginning after December 31, 1963, the income from which is returned onthe installment method, if the carrying charges or interest with respectto such sales is not included in the total contract price, payments receivedwith respect to such sales shall be treated as applying first against suchcarrying charges or interest. (f) Other accounting methods. If the vendor chooses as a matter of consistentpractice to return the income from installment sales on an accrual method(,) such a course is permissible.(g) Records. In adopting the installment method of accounting the sellermust maintain such records as are necessary to clearly reflect income inaccordance with this section, section 446 and andSection; 1.446-1.(h) <T3>Effective date.</T3> This section applies for taxable years beginningafter December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954, but generallydoes not apply to sales made after December 31, 1987, in taxable yearsending after such date. For sales made after December 31, 1987, sales madeby a dealer in personal or real property shall not be treated as saleson the installment plan. (However, see section 453(l)(2) for exceptionsto this rule.)<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.453A-2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Treatment of revolving credit plans; taxable years beginning on orbefore December 31, 1986.</ITAG>(a) <T3>In general.</T3> If a dealer sells or otherwise disposes of personalproperty under a revolving credit plan_(1) Such sales will be treated as sales on the installment plan to theextent provided in paragraph (c) of this section;(2) Income from sales treated as sales on the installment plan under paragraph(c) of this section may be returned on the installment method; and (3) Income returned on the installment method is computed in accordancewith andSection; 1.453A-1, except that_  (i) The gross profit on such sales is computed without regard to andSection;1.453A-  1 (e)(2);(ii) Under the circumstances described in paragraph (c)(6)(vi) of thissection, the taxpayer may, in computing income for a taxable year, treatall such sales as sales made in such taxable year for purposes of applyingthe gross profit percentage; and(iii) The rule contained in andSection; 1.453A-  1 (e)(3) is applied in accordancewith paragraph (c)(6)(v) of this section.(b) <T3>Coordination with traditional installment plan.</T3> A dealer who makessales of personal property under both a revolving credit plan and a traditionalinstallment plan (1) may elect to report only sales under the traditionalinstallment plan on the installment method, (2) may elect to report onlysales under the revolving credit plan on the installment method, or (3)may elect to report both sales under the revolving credit plan and thetraditional installment plan on the installment method.(c) <T3>Revolving credit plans.</T3> (1) To the extent provided in this paragraph(c) sales under a revolving credit plan will be treated as sales on theinstallment plan. The term ``revolving credit plan'' includes cycle budgetaccounts, flexible budget accounts, continuous budget accounts, and othersimilar plans or arrangements for the sale of personal property under whichthe customer agrees to pay each billing-month (as defined in paragraph(c)(6)(iii) of this section) a part of the outstanding balance of the customer'saccount. Sales under a revolving credit plan do not constitute sales onthe installment plan merely by reason of the fact that the total debt atthe end of a billing-month is paid in installments. The terms and conditionsof a revolving credit plan do not contemplate that each sale under theplan will be paid for in two or more payments and thus do not meet therequirements of andSection; 1.453A-1(c)(3)(i). In addition, since under arevolving credit plan payments are not generally applied to liquidate anyparticular sale, and since the terms and conditions of such plan contemplatethat account balances may be paid in full or in installments, it is generallyimpossible to determine that a particular sale under a revolving creditplan is to be or is in fact paid for in installments so as to meet therequirements of andSection; 1.453A-1 (c)(3)(ii). However, paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section provides rules under which a certain percentageof charges under a revolving credit plan will be treated as sales on theinstallment plan. For purposes of arriving at this percentage, these rules,in general, treat as sales on the plan those sales under a revolving installmentcredit plan: (i) Which are of the type which the terms and conditions ofthe plan contemplate will be paid for in two or more installments and (ii)Which are charged to accounts on which subsequent payments indicate thatsuch sales are being paid for in two or more installments.(2)(i) The percentage of charges under a revolving credit plan which willbe treated as sales on the installment plan shall be computed by makingan actual segregation of charges in a probability sample of the revolvingcredit accounts and by applying the rules contained in paragraph (c)(3)of this section to determine what percentage of charges in the sample isto be treated as sales on the installment plan. (See paragraph  (c) (5)of this section for rules to be used if some of the sales under a revolvingcredit plan are nonpersonal property sales (as defined in paragraph (c)(6)(iv)of this section).) Such segregation shall be made of charges which makeup the balances in the sample accounts as of the end of each customer'slast billing-month ending within the taxable year. (See paragraph (c)(6)(v)of this section for rules to be used in determining which charges makeup the balance of an account.) However, in making such segregation, anyaccount to which a sale is charged during the taxable year on which nopayment is credited after the billing-month within which the sale is made(hereinafter called the ``billing-month of sale'') and on or before theend of the first billing-month ending in the taxpayer's next taxable yearshall be disregarded and not taken into account in the determination ofwhat percentage of charges in the sample is to be treated as sales on theinstallment plan. In order to obtain a probability sample, the accountsshall be selected in accordance with generally accepted probability samplingtechniques. The appropriateness of the sampling technique and the accuracyand reliability of the results obtained must, if requested, be demonstratedto the satisfaction of the district director. If the district directoris not satisfied that the taxpayer's sample is appropriate or that theresults obtained are accurate and reliable, the taxpayer shall recomputethe sample percentage or make appropriate adjustments to the original computationsin a manner satisfactory to the district director. The taxpayer shall maintainrecords in sufficient detail to show the method of computing and applyingthe sample.(ii) For taxable years ending before January 31, 1964, a taxpayer who hasreported for income tax purposes all or a portion of sales under a revolvingcredit plan as sales on the installment method may apply the percentageobtained for the first taxable year ending on or after such date in determiningthe percentage of charges under a revolving credit plan for such priortaxable year (or years) which will be treated as sales on the installmentplan. However, in computing the percentage to be applied in determiningthe percentage of charges under a revolving credit plan which will be treatedas sales on the installment plan for such prior taxable year (or years),the rule stated in andSection; 1.453A-1(e)(3) shall not apply. See paragraph(c)(6)(v) of this section for rules relating to the application of paymentsto finance charges for such prior taxable years.(3) For the purpose of determining the percentage described in paragraph(c)(2) of this section, a charge under a revolving credit plan will betreated as a sale on the installment plan only if such charge is a sale(as defined in paragraph (c)(6) of this section) and meets the followingrequirements:(i) The sale must be of the type which the terms and conditions of theplan contemplate will be paid for in two or more installments. If the aggregateof sales charged during a billing-month to an account under a revolvingcredit plan exceeds the required monthly payment, then all sales duringsuch billing-month shall be considered to be of the type which the termsand conditions of such plan contemplate will be paid for in two or moreinstallments. The required monthly payment shall be the amount of the paymentwhich the terms and conditions of the revolving credit contract requirethe customer to make with respect to a billing-month. If the amount ofsuch payment is not fixed at the date the contract is entered into, butis dependent upon the balance of the account, then such amount shall bethe amount that the customer is required to pay (but not including anypast-due payments) as shown on the statement either:(A) For the last billing-month ending within the taxpayer's taxable yearor(B) For the billing-month of sale, whichever method the taxpayer adoptsfor all accounts. A taxpayer shall not change such method of determiningthe required monthly payment based upon the balance of the account withoutobtaining the consent of the district director. In any case where the requiredmonthly payment is not set in accordance with a consistent method usedduring the entire taxable year, the district director may determine therequired monthly payment in accordance with the method used during themajor portion of such taxable year if the use of such method is necessaryin order to reflect properly the income from sales under a revolving creditplan. The requirements stated in this paragraph (c)(3)(i) may be illustratedby the following examples:<T3>Example (1).</T3> Under the terms of a revolving credit plan the requiredmonthly payment to be made by customer A is $20. During the billing-monthending in December, sales aggregating $80 are charged to customer A's account,and during the next billing-month, ending in January, sales aggregating$19.95 and finance charges of $.60 are charged to A's account. Since theaggregate of sales charged to customer A's account during the billing-monthending in December ($80) exceeds the required monthly payment ($20), theterms and conditions of the plan contemplate that the sales charged duringsuch billing-month are of the type which will be paid for in two or moreinstallments. Since the aggregate of sales charged to customer A's accountduring the billing-month ending in January ($19.95) does not exceed therequired monthly payment, the sales making up the aggregate of sales insuch billing-month are not of the type which the terms and conditions ofthe plan contemplate will be paid for in two or more installments. <T3>Example (2).</T3> The terms of a revolving credit plan require a paymentof 20 percent of the balance of the customer's account as of the end ofthe billing-month for which the statement is rendered. A customer makespurchases aggregating $25 in the customer's next to the last billing-monthending within the taxpayer's taxable year, and the balance at the end ofthat month is $150. At the end of the customer's last billing-month endingwithin the taxpayer's taxable year, the balance of the account has decreasedto $110. If the taxpayer determines the required monthly payment by referenceto the payment required on the statement for the last billing-month endingwithin the taxable year and applies such method consistently to all accounts,then the sales making up the $25 aggregate of sales are of the type whichthe terms and conditions of the plan contemplate will be paid for in twoor more installments. Although such aggregate was less than the $30 payment(20%andmultiply;$150) required on the statement rendered for the billing-monthof sales. It was more than the $22 (20%andmultiply;$110) that the customerwas required to pay on the statement rendered for his last billing-monthending within the taxable year, and thus meets the requirements of thisparagraph (c)(3)(i). If, however, the taxpayer determines the requiredmonthly payment by reference to the payment required on the statement forthe billing-month of sale, then the sales making up the aggregate of salesduring such billing-month do not meet the requirements of this paragraph(c)(3)(i) because such aggregate was less than the $30 payment requiredon the statement rendered for such month. (ii) The sale must be charged to an account on which the first paymentafter the billing-month of sale indicates that the sale is being paid ininstallments. The first payment after the billing-month of sale indicatesthat the sale is being paid in installments if, and only if, such paymentis an amount which is less than the balance of the account as of the closeof the billing-month of sale. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii),such balance shall be reduced by any return or allowance credited to theaccount after the close of the billing-month of sale and before the closeof the billing-month within which the first payment after the billing-monthof sale is credited to the account, unless the taxpayer demonstrates thatthe return or allowance was attributable to a charge made in a month subsequentto the billing-month of sale. The requirements stated in this paragraph(c)(3)(ii) may be illustrated by the following examples, in which it isassumed that the taxpayer's annual accounting period ends on January 31.<T3>Example (1).</T3> Customer A's revolving credit account shows the followingsales and payments: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp0,i1,s10,7,6,6 </C>  <H1>Month ending </H1><H1>Aggregate sales in month </H1><H1>Payments </H1><H1>Balance</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">December 20 <D>$150 </D><D>0 </D><D>$150 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">January 20 <D>75 </D><D>$30 </D><D>195 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">February 20 <D>0 </D><D>195 </D><D>0</D></ITAG></ITAG> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">All sales made in the billing-month ending December 20 meet the requirementsof this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) because the first payment on the account aftersuch billing-month ($30) was less than the balance of the account as ofthe close of such billing-month ($150); and none of the sales made in thebilling-month ending January 20 meets the requirements of this paragraph(c)(3)(ii) because the balance of the account as of the end of such billing-monthwas liquidated in one payment. By application of the rules of paragraph(c)(6)(v) of this section, the balance in the account as of the last billing-monthending in the taxable year ($195) consists of $120 of the $150 of salesmade in the billing-month ending December 20 and all of the $75 of salesmade in the billing-month ending January 20.

Assume thefacts in example (2), except that Customer B's revolving credit ledgeraccount is for the period beginning on September 21, 1964 and ending February20, 1965. Since payments received are first used to liquidate any outstandingfinance charges under the rule in paragraph (c)(6)(v) of this section,the $20 payment in December liquidated the $0.35 finance charge accruedat the end of the November billing-month and the $20 payment in Januaryliquidated the $0.60 finance charge accrued at the end of the Decemberbilling-month.

Therefore,$35.95 of sales will be treated as sales on the installment plan. The $20aggregate of sales charged during the billing-month ending December 20does not meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section becauseit is in an amount which does not exceed the required monthly payment ($20).The $26 aggregate of sales for the billing-month ending January 20 doesnot meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section becausethe first payment after such billing-month ($72.56) was equal to the balanceof the account as of the close of such billing-month ($72.56). For thispurpose, the balance of $82.56 is reduced by the $10 return or allowancewhich was credited after the billing-month of sale and before February20. Thus, of the $82.56 balance of B's account as of the close of the lastbilling-month ending within corporation X's taxable year $35.95 will betreated as sales on the installment plan for purposes of determining thepercentage provided for in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.(5) Sales under a revolving credit plan which are nonpersonal propertysales (as defined in paragraph (c)(6)(iv) of this section) do not constitutesales on the installment plan. Therefore, the charges under a revolvingcredit plan must be reduced by the nonpersonal property sales, if any,under such plan, before application of the sample percentage as providedfor in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. The taxpayer may treat as thenonpersonal property sales under the plan for the taxable year an amountwhich bears the same ratio to the total sales under the revolving creditplan made in the taxable year as the total nonpersonal property sales madein such year bears to the total sales made in such year.(6) For purposes of this paragraph (c)_(i) The term ``sales'' includes sales of services, such as a charge forwatch repair, as well as sales of property, but does not include financeor service charges.(ii) The term ``charges'' includes sales of services and property as wellas finance or service charges.(iii) A billing-month is that period of time for which a periodic statementof charges and credits is rendered to a customer.(iv) The term ``nonpersonal property sales'' means all sales which arenot sales of personal property made by the taxpayer. Thus, sales of a departmentleased by the taxpayer to another are nonpersonal property sales. Likewise,charges for services rendered by the taxpayer are nonpersonal propertysales unless such services are incidental to and rendered contemporaneouslywith the sale of personal property, in which case such charges shall beconsidered as constituting part of the selling price of such property.(v) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(6)(v), each paymentreceived from a customer under a revolving credit plan before the closeof the last billing-month ending in the taxable year shall be applied toliquidate the earliest outstanding charges under such plan, notwithstandingany rule of law or contract provision to the contrary. For purposes ofdetermining which charges remain in the balance of an account at the endof the last billing-month ending in the taxable year, the taxpayer mayapply returns and allowances which are credited before the close of thelast billing-month ending in the taxable year either (A) to liquidate orreduce the charge for the specific item so returned or for which an allowanceis permitted, or (B) to liquidate or reduce the earliest outstanding charges.The method so selected for applying returns and allowances shall be followedon a consistent basis from year to year unless the district director consentsto a change. Additionally, finance or service charges which are computedon the basis of the balance of the account at the end of the previous billing-month(usually reduced by payments during the current billing-month) are accruedat the end of the current billing-month and are therefore considered, forpurposes of determining the earliest outstanding charges, as charged tothe account after any sales made during the current billing month. However,for purposes of determining which charges remain in the balance of an accountat the end of the last billing-month ending in a taxable year which beganafter December 31, 1963, payments received during such year shall be appliedfirst against any finance or service charges which were outstanding atthe time such payment was received. The preceding sentence shall not applywith respect to a computation made for purposes of applying the rule describedin paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.(vi) The taxpayer shall allocate those sales under a revolving credit planwhich are treated as sales on the installment plan to the proper year ofsale in order to apply the appropriate gross profit percentage as providedfor in andSection; 1.453A-1(e). This allocation shall be made on the basisof the percentages of charges treated as sales on the installment planwhich are attributable to each taxable year as determined in the sampleof accounts described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. However, ifthe taxpayer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the district directorthat income from sales on the installment plan is clearly reflected, allsales may be considered as being made in the taxable year for purposesof applying the gross profit percentage.(7) The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the followingexample:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example. </T3>Corporation X is a dealer and has elected to report onthe installment method those sales under its revolving credit plan whichmay be treated as sales on the installment plan. Corporation X's taxableyear ends on January 31, and the total balance of all its revolving creditaccounts as of January 31, 1964, is $2,000,000. The total sales made inthe taxable year are $10,000,000 of which $500,000 are nonpersonal propertysales. The gross profit percentage realized or to be realized on all salesmade in the taxable year is 40 percent. The amount of the gross profitcontained in the year-end balance of $2,000,000 which may be deferred tosucceeding years is computed as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) In order to reduce the charges appearing in the year-end balanceof revolving credit accounts receivable by the nonpersonal property salescontained therein, corporation X determines the amount of such nonpersonalproperty sales under the method permitted in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.Corporation X first determines the ratio which total nonpersonal propertysales made during the year ($500,000) bears to total sales made duringthe year ($10,000,000), and then applies the percentage (5 percent) thusobtained to the year-end balance of revolving credit accounts receivable($2,000,000). The nonpersonal property sales thus determined ($100,000)is subtracted from such year-end balance to obtain the charges under therevolving credit plan appearing in the year-end balance ($1,900,000) towhich the sample percentage is to be applied.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) In accordance with generally accepted sampling techniques, thetaxpayer selects a probability sample of all revolving credit accountshaving balances for billing-months ending in January 1964. The techniqueemployed results in a random selection of accounts with total balancesof $100,000.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) Analysis of these sample accounts discloses that of the $100,000of balances, $10,000 of balances are in accounts on which no payment wascredited after a billing-month of sale and on or before the end of thefirst billing-month ending in the taxable year beginning February 1, 1964.These balances are, therefore, disregarded and not taken into account inthe determination of what percentage of sales in the sample is to be treatedas sales on the installment plan. Of the remaining $90,000 of balances,the taxpayer determines, by analyzing the ledger cards in the sample, that$63,000 of balances are composed of sales which meet the requirements ofparagraphs (c)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section and are thus treated assales on the installment plan. The remaining $27,000 of balances eitherdid not meet the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3) (i) and (ii) of thissection or were not sales (as defined in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section).The percentage of charges in the sample treated as sales on the installmentplan is, therefore, 70 percent ($63,000 andCx.1; $90,000).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) The charges in the year-end balance which are to be treated assales on the installment plan, $1,330,000, are computed by multiplyingthe charges to which the sample percentage is applied ($1,900,000) by thesample percentage (70 percent).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(v) The deferred gross profit attributable to sales under the revolvingcredit plan for the taxable year, $532,000, is determined by multiplyingthe amount treated as sales on the installment plan ($1,330,000), by thegross profit percentage (40 percent). (Corporation X will be able to demonstrateto the satisfaction of the district director that (A) since the gross profitpercentage for all sales does not vary materially from the gross profitpercentage for all sales made under the revolving credit plan, (B) sinceonly an insubstantial amount of sales included in year-end account balanceswas made prior to the taxable year, and (C) since the prior year's grossprofit percentage does not vary materially from the gross profit percentagefor the taxable year, income from sales on the installment plan will beclearly reflected by applying the current year's gross profit percentagefor all sales under the revolving credit plan treated as sales on the installmentplan.)</ITAG>(d) <T3>Effective date</T3>.
