As reported, Citicorp is seeking buyers for its domestic investment management unit, which runs more than $20 billion of pension assets for corporations and other institutions. Manufacturers Hanover Corp. also voted thumbs down on the business recently, when it agreed to sell its institutional investment unit to a subsidiary of PaineWebber Inc. And earlier this month, BankAmerica Corp. completed the sale of its investment unit to Monarch Capital Corp.    &quot;It's too bad they don't know how to run the business,&quot; says George Collins, president of Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price Associates, a big independent manager of mutual and pension funds. &quot;We don't need the banks,&quot; he adds, &quot;there's plenty of competition without them.&quot;    James Wooden, a bank-stock analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., says more big banks might seek buyers for their institutional money management units. With earnings under pressure because of the need to create bigger reserves for loan losses, many banks are selling assets and weeding out underperforming units, he says.    Some analysts think Chase Manhattan Corp. and Chemical New York Corp. might sell investment units. They say J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. and Bankers Trust Co. aren't likely to sell their money management units, which are a big source of income for them.    Chase says it runs &quot;a lean, efficient&quot; investment management operation that &quot;makes money for us.&quot; Chemical couldn't be reached for comment. Bankers Trust said it is committed to the business. Most banks were closed yesterday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.    Commercial banks have been in the money management game for as long as anyone can remember. Their institutional business has grown smartly since the mid-1970s, when a new federal pension law forced companies to set aside more money to honor their pension obligations. And in recent years banks seemed to like the business: a steady source of income, unattended by the problems surrounding much of their lending operations.    But for some banks, the profitability of institutional investment management has lately become disappointing. Competition has forced down fees. The cost of maintaining a big staff of money managers, analysts and marketing people has cut into earnings. Some people say the banks also don't pay enough to attract talented money managers, who in turn might attract bigger fees. A senior money manager at a bank might earn $150,000, while his independent counterpart &quot;can make millions,&quot; says a New York investor.    Moreover, in the wake of the Oct. 19 stock market crash, growth prospects for the most profitable side of institutional money management -- actively managed stock portfolios -- are likely to be much lower, says David O'Donovan, a pension consultant with SEI Funds Evaluation Corp.    An independent money manager who says he has &quot;seen the numbers&quot; for Citicorp's unit says that in 1987 it generated no more than $8 million to $12 million in pretax profit, on revenue of about $60 million. Effectively managed, he says, Citicorp's $20 billion in institutional assets should generate two or three times that amount of pretax earnings.    Citicorp said it wouldn't confirm or deny the money manager's profit estimate.    Banks aren't vacating all aspects of money management. Both Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover will keep their international money management businesses, and will continue to provide the services for individuals in the U.S.    Shearson's Mr. Wooden says Citicorp has a lucrative business managing money in Switzerland and Latin America for wealthy individuals who are &quot;less sensitive&quot; to high fees.    John Keefe, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. who follows investment management concerns, says management fees for individuals in the U.S. and abroad may be equivalent to 1% or more of the assets under management. By contrast, he says, institutional fees average 0.3% of assets.    T. Rowe Price earns fees of about 0.3% on its pension management side, he estimates, while its fees for managing mutual funds are 0.5% to 0.6%. Indexed funds for institutions, a big business for some banks, may have fees as low as 0.1%, adds William Morris of Brignoli Advisers, a New York money management firm.    Low fees or not, some people think more brokerage firms besides PaineWebber are in the market for institutional money. At the very least, they would gain potential new investment banking clients.    But institutional money management isn't a low-profit cause. Because of good performance in past years, Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp., headed by New York investor Martin Sosnoff, has average fees of 0.75%, says Drexel's Mr. Keefe. Thanks to tightly controlled costs, he adds, the firm's pretax profit margins on institutional business are as high as 50%.    ---   Robert Guenther contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
