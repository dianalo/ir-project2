But now that thousands of Soviets are being letout, many are finding the doors to the United States closed.   Some 19,000 Soviets are waiting to be interviewed at the U.S.Embassy in Moscow for permission to enter the United States asrefugees; another 7,000 are waiting in temporary quarters nearRome, according to State Department figures.   The steadily growing backlog appears to result from severalfactors: poor planning by the administration, severe budgetrestraints and a change in the Justice Department's refugee policy.   ``Now that the Soviet Union has chosen to let these people go,we must not fail them,'' said Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., who hassponsored one of several proposed funding bills to ease theemergency.   Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., co-sponsor of another emergencyfunding proposal, warned that ``Gorbachev's policies could changeovernight. We have to take advantage of this moment.''   Soviet applicants have been told their processing could take aslong as two years and have been advised not to quit jobs or telllandlords they plan to leave for fear of finding themselves withoutwork or housing.   Last fall the United States asked Soviet authorities to withholdexit permits until some of the backlog can be cleared, Jewishcommunity officials say.   At the current rate of Soviet applications _ about 4,000 a month_ the United States will run out of allocated refugee slots byApril or May. In January, the State Department shifted 7,000 unusedslots meant for Vietnamese refugees to accommodate the Sovietoverflow. Revised estimates project some 40,000 Soviet applicantsthis year, about 20,000 more than was budgeted for by theadministration.   The crisis has been compounded by a change in Justice Departmentpolicy, which no longer grants automatic refugee status to everyperson seeking to leave the Soviet Union.   In the past, all Soviet Jews, who account for the majority ofSoviet emigres, were presumed to have a ``well founded fear ofpersecution'' and therefore were considered refugees.   Jews were subjected to government-backed anti-Semitism,prevented from studying Hebrew or practicing their religion anddenied permission to leave. In 1984, the low point of Jewishemigration, only 896 Jews were let out.   A directive issued last summer by former Attorney General EdwinMeese ordered the Immigration and Naturalization Service todetermine refugee status for Soviets on a case-by-case basis ratherthan as a group, in keeping with the way U.S. laws are applied forother refugee applicants.   This has resulted in denials for as many as 70 percent of Moscowapplicants for refugee status, according to a just-released reportby the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.   The report found a 50 percent reversal rate on appeal by thosedenied, evidence of ``uneven standards and inconsistencies amongINS officers.''   The report faulted INS inspectors for, in many cases, notspeaking Russian and not knowing about life in the Soviet Union. Insome cases, INS processors were brought to Moscow from duty alongthe U.S.-Mexican border and applied the same standards to Sovietapplicants as to Mexicans, the report said.   Those denied refugee status are being offered parolee status,which does not provide government funding nor does it allow therecipients to eventually apply for citizenship.   ``This sends a message to the Soviet government that the UnitedStates no longer views Jews and other minorities as persecutedpeople,'' said David Harris, Washington representative of theAmerican Jewish Committee which lobbies for Soviet Jewishimmigration. ``It's a strange political statement as a time whenthe administration has decided to keep up its pressure on Gorbachevto comply with international human rights standards,'' he said.   The administration, caught in a squeeze, is scrambling torespond.   The White House is preparing an emergency request to Congressfor $100 million to help process and resettle the flood ofemigrants.   The Justice Department has prepared legislation that would allowas many as 30,000 people to enter the United States annually if thepresident declares it in the best foreign policy interests of theUnited States. Unlike refugees, though, these people would not begiven government funding.   The State Department is conducting an internal review of theproblem in preparation for consultations with Congress onincreasing the number of refugees allowed into the country.   Meanwhile, more INS officers are being sent to Moscow to helphasten the processing, said John Moore, director of the Bureau forRefugee Programs at the State Department.   Moore told a congressional hearing that the State Departmentcould not have foreseen the surge of Soviet applicants when itbudgeted last year for this fiscal year. But members of Congressand Jewish community groups are accusing the administration ofdeliberately misleading them.   ``The administration's refugee program is phony,'' said Rep.David Obey, D-Wis., head of the House subcommittee on foreignoperations. ``This was not unpredictable in light of last year'sgrowing emigration trends,'' he told Moore.   Obey accused the administration of presenting deliberately lowpredictions in order to stay within the limits of the budget,knowing it could obtain emergency funding later on to respond tothe humanitarian crisis.   Jewish groups contend the low figures are part of anadministration attempt to shift the funding for refugee programsincreasingly to private groups.   Currently, the American Jewish community provides about $2 to $3for every government dollar spent on refugee admissions andresettlement and it has launched a $75 million fund-raisingcampaign to provide for the flood of emigres.</TEXT></DOC>
