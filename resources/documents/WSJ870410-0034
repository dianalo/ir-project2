The broadcaster, defense contractor and electric-products maker said profit increased to $151.6 million, or $1.05 a share, from $135.2 million, or 88 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales fell to $2.32 billion from $2.55 billion.    Pre-tax earnings rose in the company's energy and advanced technology, industries and commercial business segments. Profit in the broadcasting segment was flat, but the year-earlier quarter included the results of cable-TV operations that have since been sold.    Westinghouse said that if 1986 sales had been adjusted to reflect restructured businesses -- such as the cable-TV operations -- the most recent quarter's sales would have been flat compared with a year earlier.    The results matched analysts' expectations. H.P. Smith, who follows the company for Smith Barney Harris Upham andamp; Co., had projected first-quarter net income of $154 million, or $1.05 a share. Analysts said continued earnings growth at Westinghouse boosts chances that the company will announce a dividend increase at its annual meeting April 29. </TEXT></DOC>
