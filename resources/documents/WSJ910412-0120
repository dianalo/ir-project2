Deutsche Aerospace, known as DASA, also said it expects toreport a net loss for 1990. This means Daimler-Benz'smainstay Mercedes-Benz car and truck division likely will endup accounting for all group profits in its 1990 report eventhough Mercedes-Benz accounts for only 70% of Daimler-Benz's85.9 billion marks ($51 billion) in sales.</LP><TEXT>   AEG reported a group net loss of 205 million marks for1990 after posting a profit of 75 million marks in 1989.AEG's year-earlier profit came on extraordinary income fromthe 1989 sale of defense technology units and researchfacilities to other divisions within the Daimler-Benz group.Of the 1.4 billion marks in proceeds, the bulk was reinvestedin AEG and 275 million marks were posted as 1989 net profit.   AEG said its earnings were depressed by tight competitionand high research costs. AEG's 1990 net loss came on a 7.3%rise in sales to 13.1 billion marks from 12.2 billion marks ayear earlier. Order inflow rose 2% last year to 14.2 billionmarks from 13.9 billion marks.   Shareholders holding the 20% of AEG shares not held byDaimler-Benz will receive a dividend of 2.50 marks a share,paid by Daimler-Benz. On the basis of AEG's 18.62 millionshares outstanding, the payout for outside shareholderspresents Daimler-Benz with an additional outlay of 9.3million marks.   Analysts said the results confirmed speculation that theAEG group was still hobbled by high cost structures and anunfocused product range even after almost a decade ofrestructuring. In addition, they observe that AEG has had togive price concessions in the fiercely competitive worldmarket for electronics and electrical appliances.   On a broader scale, AEG's nagging problems reflect on thelimited success of Daimler-Benz Chairman Edzard Reuter'sattempts to create cost-saving synergies between the group'straditional automotive business and its new technology andaerospace units.   &quot;The synergy efforts seem to have amounted to a vast drainon management time without bringing any returns,&quot; saidStephen Reitman, an analyst for UBS Phillips andamp; Drew inLondon. &quot;What you end up with is a technology concern thatstill depends on the traditional automotive side for most orall of its profits.&quot;   The problems afflicting DASA are less institutional andmore a product of a changing environment, particularly in thedefense sector. DASA is grappling with a declining market formilitary hardware, which accounted for 48% of the division's1990 sales of 12.6 billion marks. DASA's goal is to reducethat share to 25% of sales, company officials said.   A DASA spokesman said the division posted an undisclosedoperating profit for 1990, but expects to show a net loss forthe year after accounting for currency-related losses insales of Airbus airliners, which are denominated in dollars.DASA's Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. is a partner inthe Airbus Industrie consortium along with Aerospatiale ofFrance, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones AeronauticasS.A. of Spain.   While hoping for a recovery in the dollar's value tobolster its Airbus proceeds, DASA is preparing for leanertimes for its defense-related activities, where management isbracing for cuts or postponements in NATO defense programs. Acompany projection indicates the capacity utilization inDASA's military arm will fall to 60% by 1995 from 72%currently.   In response, DASA announced plans to close or sell itsmilitary radar and radio technology plant at Eiweiler, whichemploys 630 workers. About another 370 jobs will be cut fromother DASA defense plants, the company said.   DASA's main component companies are theMesserschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm and Dornier G.m.b.H. aerospacegroups and turbine-maker Motoren andamp; Turbinen Union G.m.b.H.,all gathered together by Daimler-Benz to form Germany'slargest aerospace group.   DASA, which employs a total of 16,000 workers, said it isstill counting on Bonn giving its go-ahead for the productionof the Eurofighter. The $32 billion project shared byGermany, Britain, Italy and Spain is in its developmentphase. The partners still must decide to go into productionin the mid-1990s. In Bonn, such a decision has been put indoubt by the European peace offensive and the skyrocketingcosts of German unity.</TEXT></DOC>
