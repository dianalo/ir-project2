Consideringthat fossil fuels contribute ca 88% of world energy supplies, any limitationon production of such fuels would be immense and intractable. Difficultieson planning an international response are discussed; problems includethe possibility that a global warming could benefit some countries atthe same time that it adversely affects others, and the fact that thirdworld countries are not likely to feel they should limit fossil fueluse. Consequences for the energy industry are examined, and it is feltthat natural gas would become very important as a bridging fuel because:it has the potential to release more energy per unit of carbon dioxideemitted, and it is generally easier to use more efficiently. Legal issuesand policy options for controlling carbon dioxide emissions are alsoexamined. The policy options are felt to be quite clear; at one extreme,a heavy tax could be placed upon either the production or consumptionof carbon, or the rights to produce or consume carbon could be auctioned;at the other extreme, some form of rationing could be initiated, involvingdirect and indirect measures. One fortuitous circumstance might offera solution: conventional oil production may peak around the year 2000,and it may be possible to reach an agreement not to replace this naturaldecline with other fossil fuels, while making best use of natural gas.</TEXT></DOC>
