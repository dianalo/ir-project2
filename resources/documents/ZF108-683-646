(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Learning to Cure Technical ObsolescenceandM;Information systems professionals who work in one organization year afteryear doing energetic and valuable work for their employers may be in for arude awakening.andP;  Dedication to a particular job that they do well may haveled to a false sense of security.andP;  That security is summarily stripped awaywhen a pink slip comes floating their way, making these workers the latest ina long list of victims of technical obsolescence.andM;Technical obsolescence, which spells cancer for a career, is a serious andgrowing problem afflicting IS professionals, particularly senior analysts andprogrammers.andP;  The disease, which can stop a computer career dead in itstracks, strikes employees whose technical knowledge hasn't kept up with thestate of the art.andP;  These hapless employees, usually in their 40s and 50s, aresidelined into marginal functions or given less important assignments.andO;Sometimes, they're even laid off.andM;IS professionals can cure this debilitating disease by taking charge of theirown careers and pursuing ongoing learning programs.andP;  This is done inpartnership with enlightened management that encourages continued educationand retraining.andP;  Age, after all, does not affect a person's ability to learnnew tools, techniques and work approaches.andM;Age, however, does appear to affect job performance.andP;  This was one of themajor findings of research conducted in the 1970s by Gene Dalton and PaulThompson on engineer obsolescence.andP;  Based on my own independent researchtoward a PhD dissertation, I found that this study generally applies to theIS profession.andP;  No other relevant research has been published to date.andM;The Dalton and Thompson research showed performance evaluations falling afterthe age of 40.andP;  In the peak periods between the ages of 31-35 and 36-40,performance hit nearly 60%.andP;  In real terms, that means engineers in those agebrackets were judged to perform better than 60% of all the engineers who wererated.andP;  Performance then rapidly dropped off for each subsequent age bracket.andO;(It is important to note that these are average ratings and they are notmeant to reflect negatively on the many older engineers who receive topperformance ratings until they retire.)andM;If you compare these ratings to average IS salary practices, the widening gapbetween performance and pay after the age of 40 becomes very apparent.andP;  Tomake this comparison, the same percentage scale is used and applied in asimilar fashion.andP;  So, the average IS employee in the 31-35 age bracket, say,would fall into the 50% salary range.andP;  And again in real terms, this wouldmean that the person would earn a salary that's better than 50% of all otherIS personnel in the organization.andM;Although performance decreases after the age of 40, salary does not.andP;  Infact, the salary levels of older employees actually go up slightly, eventhough their yearly increases diminish.andP;  The continued high salaries forlower performing people after age 40 is a cause for concern and raises otherissues such as pay-for-performance and equity.andP;  This salary-performance gapgraphically and dramatically illustrates the economic impact of technicalobsolescence.andM;Pay for PerformanceandM;Are the organizations that have to pay the economic penalties ultimatelyresponsible for technical obsolescence?andP;  Are these same organizationssuffering from organizational obsolescence which in turn spawns technicalobsolescence?andM;Modern management approaches such as those espoused by Peter Druckertypically make the organization responsible for the well-being of itsemployees.andP;  I believe, on the other hand, that an employee takes quite a riskby trusting the organization in this regard.andP;  After all, the drive forcustomer satisfaction and profit in the immediate quarter places heavydemands on organizations--particularly on line managers.andM;Some major companies have the resources and commitment to take care of anemployee from entry to retirement.andP;  But only a handful of companies fall intothat category.andP;  One that does is IBM, whose &quot;no layoff&quot; policy forces it toaddress the issue of obsolescence.andP;  The company has undertaken completecareer retraining for large groups of its employees whose areas of expertiseare no longer required due to changing market conditions.andM;Most IS professionals, however, do not work for IBM or similar companies.andO;Many work for government agencies or private IS user organizations that don'thave lifetime employment policies; nor do they have a day-to-day associationwith current technology and techniques.andP;  Thus, the view of the company ascaretaker has to change.andP;  Employees must take control of their own careers.andO;The company's role then becomes one of a partner, assisting the employee incareer-long education and development.andM;Unfortunately, the concept of the adult learner is not well understood, evenamong employees themselves.andP;  For IS employees vulnerable to technicalobsolescence, the need to explore ongoing educational opportunities isparticularly crucial.andP;  Many IS professionals have to realize, perhaps for thefirst time in their careers, that doing the same thing for 15 years has madethem obsolete and overpriced.andP;  And as a result, they become candidates forreplacement or they fall victim to downsizing or other cost-cuttingcampaigns.andM;Typical line managers are equally in the dark when it comes to adulteducation, which they tend to view as the domain of the human resourcesdepartment.andP;  Managers themselves need to learn how adults learn, and theyneed to become aware of modern adult-learning principles.andP;  Such awarenesshelps ensure that their own practices are actually conducive to employeedevelopment.andM;A Lesson in LearningandM;Although there are many experts in the field, no single, unified view ofadult education exists.andP;  There is, however, general agreement about the majorcharacteristics of the adult as learner.andP;  One leading authority, MalcolmKnowles, offers the following assumptions about the adult learner:andM;* The adult learner sees himself as increasingly self directed.andM;* The adult learner's experience is valuable and should be taken advantage ofby others.andM;* The adult learner's readiness to learn develops from life tasks andproblems.andM;* The adult learner's orientation to learning is task centered.andM;* The adult learner is motivated by internal incentives.andM;Adult-learning principles do a good job of involving the individual.andP;  Theyplace a large burden on the organization, which must properly identifydevelopment requirements.andP;  The organization must also plan, design, conductand evaluate effective development programs, always bearing in mind the needsof the individual learner.andM;Adult learning principles tend to consider the person as more of anindependent agent who must be supported by the organization.andP;  In essence,it's the individual, not the organization, who is responsible for his owntraining and learning.andM;This responsibility means that career planning and education pursuits over aperson's lifetime should be self directed.andP;  So, any deficiencies betweencurrent and desired proficiencies must be assessed and plans implemented toclose the gap.andM;In assuming this responsibility, individuals must also make sure that theirwork tasks and assignments provide learning opportunities.andP;  It is not safe toassume that job assignments will automatically be done in your best interest.andO;Therefore, it's a good idea to keep your eyes open for project assignments,which often provide the best opportunity for on-the-job and other forms ofinformal learning.andM;Education does not have to mean sitting people down in a classroom,supervising them, lecturing them and hoping they get something out of it.andO;Education can, and should, be conducted outside the classroom as well, viasuch means as interactive videodisc or even satellite networks.andP;  I wouldrecommend that 75% or more of the educational effort be done outside theclassroom.andM;Enlightened companies will support self-directed career development becauseit provides them with a more productive and stable work force.andP;  In the longrun, it saves them money while saving their employees and their families fromthe trauma and disruptions associated with technical obsolescence.andM;The solution to the salary-performance gap then, is not to reduce salaries oreliminate IS employees after the age of 40.andP;  Instead, the solution stems fromensuring their performance remains high.andP;  Nevertheless, the primaryresponsibility rests with the individual.andP;  It is my belief that a commitmentto life-long learning--on the part of both employer and employee--is the onlyway to prevent technical obsolescence.andP;  Without such prevention, this careercancer will continue to rob individual companies and industry of the criticalcontribution that can be made by an aging work force.andM;A 21-year IS veteran, William Woodard is currently a PhD candidate working onhis dissertation on the topic of technical obsolescence of computerprofessionals.andP;  Woodard is eastern region vice president of Computer ScienceCorp.'s Applied Technology Division in Falls Church, Va., which providesfacilities management, software development, maintenance and support servicesincluding training.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
