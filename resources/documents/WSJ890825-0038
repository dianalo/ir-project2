Some individual investors exulted at yesterday's record and said they expect further big gains. But many said they remain wary about the outlook and haven't been active in the rally or plan to take profits soon.    Anthony Zorovic, an investor in the downtown San Francisco offices of Charles Schwab andamp; Co., was one of the optimists. Shortly after the market closed, he uncorked a bottle of champagne and began filling a dozen Styrofoam cups. Lifting one, he shouted, &quot;To another all-time high soon]&quot;    A native of Yugoslavia who now lives in San Francisco, Mr. Zorovic said the market is headed higher, and he admonished the small crowd gathered around him: &quot;For those who have to run back to work, forget your work -- we make more money here.&quot;    Not everyone was convinced. Many of these part-time investors said they remain leery about the market. &quot;This is no place for an individual investor,&quot; said Robert Hoover, a retired oil executive. &quot;It's great for crapshooters, but I can't afford to gamble.&quot; Mr. Hoover stopped in to check on his stable of stocks, he said, but he hasn't added to his holdings during this rally.    Some others who have been buying plan to take profits. &quot;Tomorrow the market will go down,&quot; said Fernand Rosset, a 62-year-old San Francisco resident. &quot;Profit-taking, that's what I plan to do.&quot;    Bruce Whitaker, who works for a leasing company, entered the market after the 1987 crash. He doesn't expect the rally to last. &quot;The next way to make significant money is on the down side,&quot; he said. In Chicago, many investors stopped in to the Fidelity Investments' storefront brokerage on LaSalle Street to check on their holdings and see if they could figure out why the market was up.    Wayne Geschke, a bank employee, was typical. &quot;I just want to know what caused&quot; the rally, he said. Mr. Geschke added that he plans to hold his &quot;small&quot; diversified stake of stocks.    Oliver Landreth, an elevator mechanic, also plans to &quot;just sit by and watch.&quot; Mr. Landreth &quot;sold utilities high&quot; in 1970 and has watched two mutual funds and some gas stocks ride the market roller coaster since then. He's making no additional purchases now, he said.    The new high was &quot;a long time coming,&quot; according to Jack Purdy, a senior broker at the Fidelity office. But business was no heavier than usual at the Fidelity window. &quot;The small investor is still not back,&quot; Mr. Purdy said. &quot;And when he returns, it'll be time to sell.&quot;    Outside, however, Charles E. Wilcox, a financial manager, was exuberant, shouting, &quot;The market's back]&quot; Mr. Wilcox is &quot;definitely&quot; back in the market himself, but his investments are &quot;hedged with 40% in Treasury notes.&quot;    A block away on Clark Street, business was good at Harlan J. Berk Ltd., dealers in rare coins and antiquities. Mr. Berk, who said his customers &quot;buy what isn't being chased,&quot; said he has seen market &quot;joy rides&quot; before and isn't optimistic about the upturn. &quot;As junk-bond issuers can't make their interest payments, there will be a reckoning,&quot; he said.    Elsewhere downtown, big lines formed for tickets to the Illinois Lottery's Saturday Lotto drawing. The jackpot was raised yesterday to $42 million.    At the Charles Schwab office in Dallas, the day was routine, according to the manager, Molly Dickson. Many customers who visited the office weren't even aware that a record had been set.    Schwab's local office managers were surprised at the scanty reaction. When the market was setting records in 1987, they recalled, a throng of ticker-tape watchers gathered. Ms. Dickson offered this explanation for the lack of activity: &quot;What we're seeing is the return of the individual investor. But they're playing it cautious, and they're playing it smart.&quot;    Yesterday's big gains were significant for Billy Duff, a 56-year-old Dallas investor and victim of the oil slump. His company was liquidated two years ago; since then, he's been a full-time investor, and his energy holdings surged yesterday. &quot;It's nice that energy stocks have turned around,&quot; he said. &quot;I feel fortunate that I've stayed with it all these years. I've never lost hope.&quot;    Now he spends most of his day scanning the tape and talking to brokers at the local office. &quot;I can't wait for the alarm tomorrow,&quot; he said.    At the New York Stock Exchange, traders were hopeful that the record would bring back the small investor, but their optimism was guarded. &quot;It was a day like any other day -- no big deal,&quot; said Peter Mancuso, a specialist with Albert Fried andamp; Co. &quot;There was no question in anyone's mind that the market would go back to this.&quot;    Many of the investors huddled around two Quotron machines in New York's World Trade Center said they had seen market records before and were skeptical that the latest level could be sustained.    As they stood in the Charles Schwab office late yesterday, the investors, many of them elderly, stayed near the machines. They took turns punching in their stocks, then headed to the back of the line. They speculated on whether the market would set a record but were quiet about it, seeming more concerned with their own holdings. Few headed to the phone banks to make trades.    &quot;There are not enough indicators that warrant this type of market. It's tenuous. It's fragile,&quot; said Jack Ennis, who nonetheless said he has some &quot;highfliers.&quot;    &quot;But, of course, I'm happy it's up,&quot; Mr. Ennis added. He says he watches companies individually and, in general, discounts the movement of the market averages.    The record has &quot;no significance whatsoever,&quot; said Ray Patel. Broader indexes, he said, &quot;repeatedly ran over&quot; their highs earlier this year with little hoopla because they aren't so well-known.    Willie Humphrey said he holds only one stock, but had some interest in the index anyway and predicted that it would drop today. &quot;It's an up-and-down market, a very funny market,&quot; he said. &quot;They sucker you in. For the index to mean anything, it's got to stay level.&quot;    Bob Schmidt, another New York investor, said he is holding on to what stocks he has -- even though he has some big paper gains and hasn't been &quot;terribly bullish&quot; since the summer of 1982 -- because he's waiting for a drop in the capital-gains tax.    &quot;I'm really neutral at this point,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think the values exist right now.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Thursday's Markets: Programs Also Have Big Effect&quot;-- WSJ Aug. 25, 1989) </TEXT></DOC>
