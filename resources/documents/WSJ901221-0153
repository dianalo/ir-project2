Denver wasflooded with resumes for front-office jobs. And Tampa Bay,Buffalo and Washington went equally nuts this week over theprospect of getting one of the two worst teams in baseball.   The six cities were named finalists for the NationalLeague's first expansion in more than 20 years. The twowinners will be picked by next September and begin play in1993. The contest will be as heated as a pennant race becauseit carries World Series-sized stakes: for aspiring cities,the chance to be called Big League; for would-be owners, thechance to join the inner circle of the national pastime.</LP><TEXT>   The quest has already been long and arduous -- Tampa Bay'sdating back 13 years -- but the intensity now ratchets up anotch. Miami's owner laid plans for a name-the-team contest,a season-ticket drive and other shows of fan support. Buffalowill invite National League owners to see its rabid sportsfans at a Bills football playoff game. Washington is lookingfor a heavy-hitter to both bolster and burnish its ownershipgroup. Said the group's leader, John Akridge: &quot;I'm outlooking for a zillionaire.&quot;   Indeed, while the expansion game plays out on many levels-- market comparisons, political maneuverings, civicimplorings -- above all it is about money. Large sums ofmoney. When baseball last expanded in 1977, the AmericanLeague entry fee was $7 million; now it's $95 million. Thatyear, the average player salary was $76,000; now it's about$600,000. In the late 1970s, baseball was a cozy little $300million industry; today, its revenues top $1.2 billion.   At one level, the $190 million infusion of franchise feesis a life buoy to keep the incumbent owners' heads abovewater. Though baseball turned a $214 million pretax operatingprofit in 1989, salaries are spiraling upward fast and teamsin smaller markets are struggling. And every team has beenjolted by a collusion ruling against baseball's owners thatcost each of them $10.8 million. The expansion fees, divviedamong the 12 existing National League teams, replenishcoffers by $15.8 million apiece. The incumbents do have toprovide players to the expansion teams, but only the dregs oftheir rosters.   It's such a great deal, in fact, that the American Leagueis deeply jealous. After the four-member expansion committee,composed of three current owners and National LeaguePresident Bill White, makes its recommendations, new teamsmust be approved by nine of the National League's 12 ownersand a majority of the American League's 14 owners. AmericanLeague owners are demanding a cut of the franchise fees. TheNational League is adamantly opposed. If the issue is notpeacefully resolved by Commissioner Fay Vincent, the AmericanLeague could eventually act as a spoiler, using its vetopower to block the National League from where it would mostlike to go.   That, clearly, is Florida. Quite beyond short-termself-interest, baseball has long-term strategic reasons forexpansion. By adding big markets, it can build national TVratings. By entering virgin baseball territory, it can expandits fan base. And if it expands into booming areas, there'slots of potential for attendance growth. Florida is all ofthose. It's the fourth most populous state, the third fastestgrowing -- and it has no big-league team. California hasfive.   Florida has one entry, Tampa Bay, that is the nation's13th largest media market. It has another, Miami, that couldbe a great export market for baseball to Latin America. Ithas a third, Orlando, that's the fastest growing city inAmerica. The only real question is whether the NationalLeague will put one of its two new teams in Florida -- orboth. The answer may depend on how the American Leaguedispute plays out; it may depend on whether the NationalLeague wants more geographic diversity; and it may depend onwhether baseball fears political trouble on Capitol Hill ifone state gets all the action.   If Florida doesn't make a clean sweep, either Denver orWashington is likely to get the second team. Denver positionsitself as another virgin-territory candidate, opening upbaseball to a whole swath of the country without it. If onlymore people lived there. Washington, D.C., positions itselfas the demographics candidate: ninth largest U.S.metropolitan area, seventh largest media market, biggest citywithout a big-league team -- not to mention home to a lot ofmembers of Congress who like baseball. If only it weren't sonear Baltimore, the Orioles' home 40 miles away.   For, above all, baseball doesn't want to cannibalizepresent teams' markets. That violates good marketingprinciples. More important, it violates present owners'sensibilities. Indianapolis was an early expansion hopeful,even mounting a drive that sold 11,000 season tickets. But itis only about 100 miles from Cincinnati. The drive died whenReds owner Marge Schott, asked about the city's chances,replied, &quot;Over my dead body.&quot;   That's also what makes Buffalo a long-shot candidate,though it made the short list. It's so close to Toronto,Cleveland and Pittsburgh that some were stunned it got thisfar. The cannibal factor definitely contributed to sinkingSacramento (near the two Bay Area teams), Charlotte (Atlanta)and Nashville (nestled among Atlanta, Cincinnati and St.Louis).   Buffalo is also a place that would look better underbaseball's old economics. It could count on huge fan support.The Buffalo Bisons have set minor-league attendance recordsby drawing more than a million fans each of the past threeseasons. But gate receipts mean a lot less than they used to.A big local TV deal is essential. Any Florida team wouldstart out with the advantage of a big market. It could figureon at least an $8 million a year broadcast deal, or more thandouble some existing contracts. Buffalo, only the nation's38th biggest media market, would be disadvantaged.   The National League not only wants viable markets but,more than ever, certainty that the new owners can play thiscostly game. It's in National League owners' interest to addstrong teams, even if that means an irksome new competitorfor free agents or pennants. Unlike many other industries,baseball is only as strong as its weakest links. &quot;If they`competed' one of the Big Three automakers out of business,the others wouldn't cry,&quot; says former Commissioner BowieKuhn. &quot;But if a team goes out of business in baseball, you'vebusted up your league.&quot;   Baseball prefers local owners, who won't be tempted tomove to another city -- and make a mess for baseball -- ifthe going gets rough. But that's clearly a secondaryconsideration, considering the finalist selection of a TampaBay group bankrolled by non-locals, an Orlando group headedby Michigan resident and Amway billionaire Richard DeVos anda Denver group headed by a Youngstown beverage distributor.Baseball is mostly looking for rich owners; it allows just40% of a team's purchase price to be financed. The centralquestion, in expansion parlance, has become, &quot;Can he writethe check?&quot;   The economy forced several once-aspiring owners to pockettheir pens. The baseball economy, moreover, is ever morescary to expansion owners. Since the end of the season, teamshave lavished more than $230 million on free agents. Thataccelerates the salary spiral, even as CBS's $170 millionwrite-off of baseball losses portends a skimpier national TVdeal in the future. In an open letter to Buffalo fans lastweek, owner candidate Bob Rich Jr. warned that the trends maymake baseball unaffordable there. &quot;We do not believe inbaseball at any cost,&quot; he said.   Making money isn't the sole consideration, of course. Someare in this for civic pride. &quot;It's a labor of love, although$100 million is a lot of love,&quot; says Mr. Akridge. Some aredrawn by the limelight. &quot;There's a lot of ego in it,&quot; saysAbel Holtz, a banker in Miami who led an unsuccessfulownership group there. Some are rabid baseball fans. While ata Dodger fantasy camp last year, cousins S. Joel Schur andStephen Porter got a lead on buying a minor-league St.Petersburg team. Hooked on running that, they went after theTampa Bay franchise. But, says Mr. Porter, &quot;We made adecision: If this didn't make economic sense, we wouldn't doit.&quot;   Baseball does make economic sense as acapital-appreciation play. One expansion team, the SeattleMariners, was bought for a fee of $7 million in 1977, soldfor $13.1 million in 1981 and for $77 million in 1990.Another, the New York Mets, was bought for $3.75 million in1962, sold for $26 million in 1980 and for $100 million in1986.   For cities, the upside is even greater. Denver figures ateam would generate about $93 million a year for the localeconomy. The indirect benefits are far greater. &quot;A big-leagueteam will bring big-league companies,&quot; says Thomas Ferguson,president of the Beacon Council, a privateeconomic-development group in Miami. &quot;When companies choosewhere to expand operations, they consider baseball andfootball as amenities that attract people.&quot;   That's why, when Denver's original owner dropped out,Colorado Gov. Roy Romer personally scrambled around toassemble a new investor group. It's why Denver and Orlandohave committed to building stadiums, at $100 million-plus apop, if they get teams. It's why Washington has committed $25million to renovate RFK Stadium. It's why St. Petersburg andthe county it's in spent $110 million building a domedstadium on speculation to compete for a franchise under theTampa Bay banner.   It's also why there's a Senate task force on expansion,used by senators to pressure baseball into giving theirconstituents teams. Its chairman, Democratic Sen. Tim Wirthof Colorado, has helped keep Denver's hopes alive. Florida'sRepublican Sen. Connie Mack has one of baseball's greatnames, as grandson of the longtime Philadelphia Athleticsowner, and has helped the Florida cause. The implicit threat:Congress could repeal baseball's antitrust exemption ifbaseball doesn't expand quickly and in the right places.   That's just one level of the expansion game, which alsoinvolves back-room politicking, back-alley-style jabbing andslick marketing. Orlando's video presentation to the NationalLeague was produced by the local Disney studio. Miami ownercandidate H. Wayne Huizenga poured about $500,000 into hispresentation, including leather-bound fact books, Tiffanypaperweight gifts and a slick ode-to-South-Florida video. Mr.Huizenga has some advantages in that medium as chairman ofBlockbuster Entertainment Corp.   He also has the advantage of having Pittsburgh PiratesPresident Carl Barger on Blockbuster's board and BeaconCouncil Chairman Jeb Bush in the Miami corner. Mr. Bush isthe brother of Texas Rangers general partner George W. Bush,who is the son of the other George Bush. This is the contactslevel of the game, played widely and aggressively. The TampaBay group includes developers Sidney and Allen Kohl,Wisconsin natives who are close to Milwaukee Brewers ownerBud Selig, who is close to New York Mets co-owner FredWilpon, who sits on the expansion committee.   Not that it's always an advantage to be a known quantity.Larry Schmittou, the leader of Nashville's group, helpedscuttle his slim chances during a recent dispute between themajors and minors. Mr. Schmittou, who runs two minor leagueteams, was a vociferous member of the minors' negotiatingcommittee.   Since the National League also is an exclusive club,personal comportment could be decisive in a close contest.This is sometimes known as &quot;the O'Malley factor,&quot; to wit: Canthe applicant be envisioned at the same table as PeterO'Malley, the powerful, imposing owner of the Los AngelesDodgers?   Even so, the battle could feature some aspects that wouldmake Mr. O'Malley blush. Orlando may have offered a previewwhen its minor-league team held a &quot;St. Petersburg Night&quot; lastAugust.   This &quot;salute&quot; to its expansion competitor included freeadmission for people over 60, a cane-throwing contest andCream of Wheat and Geritol at the concession stands. Explainsthe team president and Orlando expansion chief, Pat Williams:&quot;I was just trying to bring some life to a town that's sodull the roosters sleep till noon.&quot;   ---              Going for the Big League                                                                                                          Six U.S. cities are in competition for the two newNational League franchises.
