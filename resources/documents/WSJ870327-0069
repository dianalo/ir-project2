A. Gary Klesch, chairman and chief executive officer of London-based Quadrex Securities Ltd., which brought the idea of the exchange to the Amex, said the proposed exchange would be modeled after the National Association of Securities Dealers automated quotation system, which governs the U.S. over-the-counter market.    In Washington, SEC officials said the proposal raises several regulatory issues. Linda Quinn, the SEC's director of corporation finance, said, &quot;We're still looking at the proposal.&quot;    SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest endorsed the idea as one way to recapture the business of many institutional investors who now go abroad to invest in foreign securities.    &quot;A properly structured market could allow those transactions to take place in the U.S. without reducing the level of investor protection one whit,&quot; Mr. Grundfest said. &quot;We can bring back to New York a piece of the business that's going to London and elsewhere, and we can do it safely.&quot;    Mr. Klesch said Quadrex, a securities trading and investment banking group with about $40 million of capital, and the Amex would jointly own the exchange, but he declined to disclose the structure of the partnership. &quot;As a private stock exchange it will come under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,&quot; he said. &quot;We've been consulting the SEC on this and expect to launch the exchange sometime this fall.&quot;    Quadrex and the Amex began planning for the proposed exchange a year ago, Mr. Klesch said. He said the main purpose of the exchange is &quot;to enable non-U.S. companies issuing debt or equity securities outside the U.S. to place them with U.S. investors. We're trying to streamline the private-placement mechanism for selling Eurobonds or Euroequities into the U.S. as soon as they're issued.&quot;    Mr. Klesch said it isn't clear whether the foreign securities listed on the proposed exchange would be denominated in dollars or their native currencies. He said he doesn't expect &quot;great things from the exchange in the beginning. This is going to take a long time to catch on.&quot;    The proposed exchange faces several obstacles. One is the U.S. Treasury prohibition against the issuance of anonymous bearer securities such as Eurobonds. Another is the lack of a U.S.-based depositary for foreign stocks and bonds. Many U.S. institutional investors require the physical delivery of securities in the U.S. once they are purchased.    In the Eurobond market, underwriters are prohibited under U.S. regulations from selling new public issues to U.S.-based investors until 90 days after they're placed with investors overseas.    However, U.S. regulations permit some private placements in the U.S. of newly issued Eurobonds to U.S.-based investors. &quot;We're trying to standardize that process, so companies that list on our exchange will automatically be able to have their securities sold to U.S. investors the day the securities are issued,&quot; Mr. Klesch said. The exchange would deal only in the securities of non-U.S. companies, he said.    Mr. Klesch said he isn't sure whether the proposed exchange would represent a competitive threat to the New York Stock Exchange's listed foreign equities, which trade in the form of American depositary receipts and which must meet various SEC disclosure requirements.    In addition, commission officials will have to decide whether the new exchange must be registered with the SEC and whether foreign securities on that exchange must be registered before they can be bought and sold freely by U.S. pension funds, insurance companies and other socalled sophisticated investors.    There has been a substantial resale of foreign debt under a series of exemptions from the registration requirement. Currently, the SEC staff is working on a range of rule proposals to codify the legal theory underlying the exemptions. The commission will decide on the breadth of the rule, which could facilitate the birth of the exchange.    ---   Steve Swartz contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
