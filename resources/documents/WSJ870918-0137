Mrs. Aquino also dropped from the cabinet another close and contentious adviser, Presidential Counsel Teodoro Locsin, although she asked him to remain in government as a consultant.    The moves came one day after the president replaced Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin with Public Works and Highways Secretary Vicente Jayme, and Vice President Salvador Laurel resigned from the cabinet by stepping down from his post as foreign affairs secretary.    Last week, the entire 26-member cabinet and other important government officials offered to resign. The cabinet shakeup followed increasingly public and deep splits within the faction-ridden Aquino government.    Senior government and ruling-party sources said other cabinet members will be replaced over the next two weeks. Among those likely to be dropped is Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod, according to the sources. They said it's likely that Central Bank Gov. Jose Fernandez will remain in the government. Mr. Fernandez was among those to offer his resignation to Mrs. Aquino.    Catalino Macaraig will succeed Mr. Arroyo. A former undersecretary in the Justice Department during the Marcos regime and a leading corporate lawyer, Mr. Macaraig has been Mr. Arroyo's deputy and is widely perceived to be an Arroyo supporter. &quot;He'll remain a very important conduit for Joker's ideas,&quot; a senior foreign businessman said.    The dismissal of Mr. Arroyo had been expected since disgruntled military officers came close to overthrowing Mrs. Aquino's government late last month. During the coup attempt, Mr. Arroyo publicly castigated even loyal military forces, many of whom continue to accuse the former human rights lawyer of being anti-military and sympathetic to communism.    In testimony before Congress last week, Mr. Arroyo also lambasted three leading businessmen and criticized both Mr. Ongpin and Vice President Laurel, further alienating centrists within the government and the business community.    Mr. Locsin also was widely criticized after he allegedly shouted orders at military officers during last month's coup attempt. Both he and Mr. Arroyo are considered imperious. Mr. Arroyo is also perceived to be overly protective of Mrs. Aquino.    The dismissals of Messrs. Locsin and Arroyo were well received by many businessmen and politicians.    Mr. Arroyo's days may have been numbered after the coup, but he retained enough clout with Mrs. Aquino to assure that rival cabinet members were removed with him, political analysts said. Mr. Ongpin, an outspoken and often combative individual who was opposed by Mr. Arroyo on both political and personal levels, became one victim.    Separately, Armed Forces Chief of Staff Fidel Ramos denied rumors that he was offered a cabinet post by Mrs. Aquino. In a television interview, Gen. Ramos said he had no political ambitions and that he and the majority of the military continued to support the civilian government of Mrs. Aquino.    &quot;Dictatorship isn't the answer to the ills of Philippine society,&quot; said Gen. Ramos, who added that he agreed to appear on a live press interview to &quot;assure the public&quot; that the government remains in control.    Rumors that Gen. Ramos would announce his resignation had sent the stock market tumbling. The Manila composite index dropped 80.98 points to 693.99.    Gen. Ramos also confirmed for the first time that Philippine authorities were looking into possible foreign involvement in the coup attempt, the Associated Press reported. Gen. Ramos said the military was investigating the presence of &quot;some foreign personnel&quot; near armed forces headquarters during the uprising. He declined to elaborate. </TEXT></DOC>
