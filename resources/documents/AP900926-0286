The president's announcement on Wednesday night was made afterthe market closed to finish off a day in which wild rumors pushedcrude oil futures to a record-high settlement price of $38.67 perbarrel.   Kevelson said that when the exchange opens on Thursday morning,speculators will probably take a cue from the way overseas oilmarkets respond.   ``I'd be interested to see how London reacts off this,''Kevelson said.   The White House said the government would take 5 million barrelsof crude out of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, whichcontains nearly 600 million barrels of oil stored in salt cavernsin Texas and Louisiana. In announcing the decision, spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater said there has been no justification for therecent run-up in oil and gasoline prices.   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, crude oil prices havealmost doubled, from around $20 per barrel to nearly $40.   Oil has shot up amid war jitters on the trading floor, eventhough supplies have remained at adequate levels. The cash pricethat is paid by oil companies is closely related to the futuresprice that is paid by speculators who gamble on future supply anddemand but rarely take possession of any oil.   Bush's move drew criticism from those who point out that thestrategic reserve was put in place following the oil shocks of theearly 1970s as a mechanism to fight oil shortages, but not highprices.   ``I think the administration may be trying to curb thespeculation of people in the Mercantile Exchange who keep biddingup the price, which is having an effect on inflation,'' saidProfessor James M. Patterson of the Indiana University School ofBusiness. ``This is really an economic move rather than anenergy-policy move.''   Patterson said, ``I think this is strictly a political response.I think it's inappropriate, but it may also serve as a test for theworkability of the reserve.''   The reserve has never been used apart from a 1-million barreltest sale in 1985 that was not aimed at influencing prices. Oilfrom the reserve is auctioned by the Energy Department and pickedup by the bidders who are selected.   A potential problem of the reserve is its quantities of ``sour''crude, which contains high sulfur content that makes the oilunusable in many U.S. refineries.</TEXT></DOC>
