Michael A. Peri, 21, of Laguna Niguel, Calif., returnedvoluntarily to his unit Saturday. He disappeared Feb. 21 from the11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Fulda, about 62 miles northeast ofFrankfurt.   The disappearance baffled military officials, who said Peri hadbeen a model soldier.   Peri was charged with being absent without leave and for enteringthe half-mile-wide security zone near the communist East Germanborder without permission, said Lt. Col. Jake Dye, a spokesman forthe U.S. Army's 5th Corps in Frankfurt.   Active duty U.S. forces must have permission to enter the areasnext to the border with East Germany.   Dye said Peri also was charged with theft of a vehicle and otheritems, including a portable computer he took from the regimentalintelligence office where he worked.   Peri has undergone questioning since he returned to his unit lateSaturday. His disappearance prompted speculation he had defected toEast Germany because his military vehicle was found parked andundamaged near the border.   Dye said Peri, of Laguna Niguel, Calif., has refused to tellauthorities where he was or what he was doing during his absence.   ``Mr. Peri, on the advice of counsel, has elected not to commentto investigating authorities,'' Dye said.   Dye said Peri had been moved to a military detention facility inMannheim to await a court-martial.   Peri had worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist andwas responsible for monitoring radar and other military signals.   He has been stationed in West Germany since March 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
