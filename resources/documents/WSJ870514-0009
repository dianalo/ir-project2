But changing immigration patterns may avert a serious shortfall.    Data from the Census Bureau's June 1986 Current Population Survey show that immigrants are entering the U.S. in near-record numbers and that a large percentage are in the entry-level-worker age group of 15 to 29. Moreover, most of the immigrants who have arrived since 1980 have entered the country legally. Thus, employers' fears that the new immigration law will reduce the labor pool may be exaggerated; some companies may be able to meet their manpower needs with legal immigrants.    In June 1986, the U.S. had 15.3 million foreign-born residents, an increase of 4.4 million from 1980. Forty-four percent of those new immigrants -- or 1.9 million people -- were age 15 to 29. By contrast, the resident population age 15 to 29 has declined by 2.3 million since 1980.    Legal immigration in this decade already equals that for the 1970s, and the Census Bureau's survey found that the number of illegal aliens is only 15% to 40% of the number of legal immigrants.    The demand for labor in the U.S. appears to be the driving force behind the increase in immigration, particularly among young people from Asia and Latin America. Since the Census Bureau projects the number of 20- to 29-year-old Americans to decline for at least the next 10 years, young workers from other countries will continue to be needed.    Fizzling Fitness?   Has the fitness boom peaked? According to a recent survey, fewer people are working out now than in 1983, the height of the exercise boom. And the growth in sales of exercise equipment may be slowing.    According to Find/SVP, a market research company in New York, about one-third of U.S. adults say they exercise regularly, down from 38% in 1983. At the same time, the market for physical fitness and exercise equipment -- which grew from an estimated $723 million in sales in 1982 to more than $1.2 billion in 1985 -- appears to be cooling off. Find/SVP projects that 1991 sales will total $2.1 billion, which represents an annual growth rate of 7% vs. 12% last year. The prime consumers of fitness equipment are men age 25 to 34 with college degrees and annual household incomes of $45,000 or more.    Makers of exercise and fitness equipment may try to bolster retail sales by targeting corporations seeking to cut the cost of employee health-care benefits.    After Tenneco, the Houston-based oil company, opened its own fitness facility in 1982, an internal study found that annual medical bills for male employees who exercised regularly averaged $442 less than the bills for non-exercisers. Among female employees, the difference was $896.    Child-Care Woes   Working parents often complain that unreliable child care is a major problem. A new Census Bureau survey documents those problems -- and shows how they affect employers.    One in 20 working mothers told Census Bureau interviewers that they had lost time from work during the previous month because of problems with child care. Surprisingly, 6% of mothers who lived with a husband missed some work vs. only 4.4% of those without husbands. Lost time was a large problem particularly among mothers of pre-schoolers.    Mothers were able to rely most on organized child-care facilities, according to the survey. Just over 1% of mothers using day-care centers lost time from work, compared with nearly 8% who had their child cared for in another private home. Nursery schools were only slightly more reliable than baby sitters in the child's home; 4.3% of mothers with children in nursery school had to leave work at least once in 30 days compared with 5.4% of those who had their own baby sitter.    More working women are using organized child-care facilities. In the Census Bureau survey, 25% of working women who had a child under age 5 used such facilities in 1985, compared with just 16% in 1982. While the median weekly expenditure for child care was only $38, the Census Bureau estimates that parents in 1985 spent a total of $11.5 billion on child care.    The report, titled &quot;Who's Minding the Kids?&quot; quantifies the widespread use of child-care services and provides more evidence that employers who support or organize day-care centers for their employee's children will benefit from less absenteeism and higher productivity. </TEXT></DOC>
