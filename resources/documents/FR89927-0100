Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement Regarding the ProposedRule Changes</ITAG>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization includedstatements governing the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule changesand discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule changes. Thetext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in ItemIV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, setforth in sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspectsof such statements.(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose and StatutoryBasis for the Proposed Rule ChangeThe purpose of these rule amendments is to promote cooperation and facilitationof transactions among the ITS participants. The Intermarket Trading System(ITS) was adopted for the purpose of enabling the participating marketcenters to act jointly in planning, developing, operating and regulatingthe System and its applications so as to further the objectives of Congressas set forth in section 11A(a) of the Act.Representatives from each participating market center meet periodicallyduring each year for the purpose of reviewing current ITS rules and, ofcourse, areas where further interpretation and/or rules become necessary.These amendments were the result of such meetings where representativesunanimously voted to adopt such as amendments to the ITS Plan and incorporatethe same within each market center's regulatory framework. It is expectedthat each participating market center will file a separate 19b-4 covering``Previous day's closing prices'', ``Responsibility to seek a report''and ``Third party trade-throughs''.The first amendment concerns ``Previous day's closing prices''. Wheneveran exchange specialist, in arranging the opening transaction on the exchangein a security traded through the ITS System anticipates that such openingtransaction will be at a price that represents a specified change fromthe previous day's consolidated closing price, he must notify the otherparticipant markets of the situation and those markets may seek to participatein the opening. When unusual market conditions render consolidated closingprices, on broad scale, inappropriate as the basis for the pre-openingapplication this amendment will allow for a simplified procedure to allowthe last price at which a transaction was reported in a particular stockon the American or New York Stock exchange, as appropriate, to be designatedthe ``previous day's closing price'' for purposes of the ITS pre-openingapplication.The second amendment concerns the Responsibility to seek a report by themarket maker (Specialist). This responsibility occurs when a pre-openingor re-opening indication of interest has been sent through the (ITS) Systemto other markets. In the past because of some ambiguities in the ITS Planit was not clear that a market maker (Specialist) who had issued a responseto an indication also had a responsibility to inquire through the systemas to whether or not he had participated in the opening. The amendmentnow more clearly places responsibility on a market maker (Specialist) toseek a report of participation after the opening if a report has not beenissued by that opening market place.The third amendment concerns <T3>Third party trade-throughs</T3>. The ITS Plan and Exchange rules definetrade-throughs as well as certain exceptions which may justify a particulartrade as not requiring satisfaction as a trade-through. This particularamendment is being incorporated within the exceptions for a third partytrade-through. This amendment will require an administrative message whichwill clearly identify a particular transaction as one in satisfaction ofa third party trade-through problem to avoid further confusion and/or errorswhen a trade occurs in satisfaction of a trade-through from a third participatingmarket center.The statutory basis for this rule change is Section 6(b)(5) of the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934 in that it is designed to facilitate transactionsin securities and perfect the mechanism of a national market system. Further,as noted herein concerning the Intermarket Trading System these amendmentsfurther the objectives of Congress as set forth in Section 11A(a) of theAct.(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on CompetitionNo burden on competition is perceived by the adoption of these rule amendments.(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the ProposedRule Change Received from Members, Participants, or OthersComments have neither been solicited nor received.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timingfor Commission Action </ITAG>Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> or within such longer period (i) as the Commissionmay designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer periodto be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding of (ii) as towhich the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (A) By order approve such proposed changes, or (B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule changesshould be disapproved. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV.

If, on or following trade date, he does requesta report through the System as to his participation before 4:00 PM easterntime, an he does not receive a response by 9:30 AM eastern time on thenext trading day, he need not accept a later report.
