Such a law would make Hungary the first Soviet bloc country inwhich strikes would be a legitimate form of worker protest.   Current law makes a vague reference to the right to ``workstoppage,'' but strikes virtually are illegal in Hungary.   The state news agency MTI quoted Sandor Nagy, general secretaryof the Hungrian Trade Union Council, as saying parliament shouldpass a trade union law ``with due stipulations ... about the rightto strike and the conditions of taking that industrial action.''The next parliamentary session is in September.   Nagy was elected to the post in June as part of the CommunistParty and government reshuffle. The moves followed a partyconference in May at which Karoly Grosz replaced longtime partyleader Janos Kadar.   For decades, strikes were officially non-existent in CommunistEastern Europe, and the goverments' official line was that theywere unnecessary because workers are the owners of factories underMarxist doctrine.   Strikes have occurred recently, however, in the Soviet Union,Poland and Yugoslavia.</TEXT></DOC>
