Brown andamp;Sons Inc. &quot;The real question in my mind is how long these`good' retailers can buck the trend,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm sure thatquestion is being asked by some of these retail executives:when does my stock stop outperforming?&quot;   Insider selling has been strong at Gap, a SanFrancisco-based casual-wear chain.
