Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr opened the platform hearing by asking thedelegates not to refer to Dukakis by name in the document. Orr, thecommittee chairman, said past GOP platforms avoided directreferences to the Democrats' nominee.   ``That's a very good idea since obviously after November 1988Governor Dukakis will fade into oblivion,'' said New Hampshire Gov.John Sununu. ``We don't want anyone to have to refer to anencyclopedia to figure out what we have to say.''   The Democratic platform does not mention George Bush or RonaldReagan by name.   Sen. Bob Kasten of Wisconsin, a co-chairman of the committee,told reporters that none of the subcommittee revisions was ``givinganyone major heartburn.'' Kasten said the panel would seek tofinish drafting the platform Thursday, a day ahead of schedule.   The Republicans also released what they said was a GOP staffestimate of how much implicit promises in the Democratic platformwill wind up costing taxpayers: $43.1 billion in 1989 alone.   The full 106-member Republican Platform Committee today beganreviewing the document anew line by line, after seven subcommitteesspent Tuesday putting their imprint on 158 pages of staff-producedworking papers.   That draft is largely a distillation of policies from the 1984GOP platform and stands that Bush has staked out on such issues aschild care and education.   It includes new planks on AIDS and the homeless, as well as theGOP's hard and fast line against abortion and higher taxes.   Orr said the subcommittees were not making major changes, butemphasized, ``Until we're done on Friday, it's not a done deal,It's not over with.''   The subcommittees, taking advice from such Bush campaignemissaries as former Texas Sen. John Tower, resisted most moves topush the platform to the left or right.   The defense subcommittee called for ``rapid and certaindeployment of SDI as technology permits.'' The original draft,echoing Bush campaign language, had just spoken of deployment ``assoon as possible.''   In the family subcommittee, Lynn Glaze, a Delaware delegate, wasrebuffed three times when she sought to soften the anti-abortionlanguage. Her motions were tabled without discussion, as was hercall for support of the Equal Rights Amendment.   Bunny Chambers, a member of the conservative Eagle Forum fromOklahoma City who moved to table Glaze's amendments, said, ``I feltlike we'd discussed enough (in the past). I didn't want to spendall the time on it.''   The family subcommittee also killed a plank on the special needsof ``little persons'' _ dwarfs. Committee members expressedconfusion about the term `little persons'' and what the plank wasdoing in the draft.   On AIDS, not addressed in 1984, the draft promises to ``not onlymarshal our scientific resources against AIDS, but ... protectthose who do not have the disease.'' It is silent on the civilrights legislation for AIDS victims recommended by a presidentialcommission.   The family subcommittee did amend the AIDS plank to say victims``should be encouraged to seek early diagnosis and to remain on thejob or in school as long as they are functionally able.''   The defense subcommittee balked at an amendment by itsco-chairman, Angela ``Bay'' Buchanan, to declare a goal of U.S.``space dominance.'' Buchanan, the former U.S. treasurer fromIrvine, Calif., said she was satisfied with compromise languagethat space must be kept free and secure for all nations.   Gone from the draft documents was the 1984 GOP declaration that``we shall keep the peace by keeping our country stronger than anypotential adversary.''   On taxes, the draft says, ``Republicans unequivocally reiteratethe no-tax pledge we have proudly kept.''   Like the 1984 platform, the draft calls for the appointment ofjudges ``who respect traditional family values and the sanctity ofhuman life.''   Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut skipped Tuesday'ssession to return to Washington, but planned to be back today towage his uphill battle for liberal amendments.   The draft documents back a line-item veto, a balanced budgetamendment to the Constitution and ``a flexible freeze on currentgovernment spending.''   They endorse a child-care tax credit for families of modestmeans. Bush recently proposed a $1,000-per-child credit forfamilies with incomes up to $20,000.   The draft speaks of the importance of imparting to children``the Judeo-Christian values of Western civilization and our idealsof liberty.'' The family subcommittee rejected an amendment tochange ``Judeo-Christian'' to ``traditional.''   On abortion, the draft declares ``the unborn child has afundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed,''and calls again for a constitutional amendment to ban abortion.   It says, ``Republicans deplore the apartheid system of SouthAfrica,'' but warns against economic pressures that harm blackworkers and entrepreneurs there.   The foreign policy panel added a plank declaring that,``Republicans are strongly committed to obtaining the freedom ofall Americans held captive by terrorist elements in the MiddleEast.''</TEXT></DOC>
