ABC News pollsters who have been tracking the 1988 race say itwould be a mistake for the Democrats to pop their champagne corkssince voters know little about the Massachusetts governor and theiropinions are still loosely held. In fact, voters say they also knowlittle about Bush.   Four in 10 of those surveyed last month could not locateDemocrat Dukakis or Republican Bush on the ideological spectrum.   ``Everything about this race would suggest a close one despiteDukakis' current lead _ because his support is soft,'' said JeffAlderman, director of the network's polling unit. He notes thepercentage who say they don't know enough about Dukakis is nearlytwice that of Bush.   Jackson has helped, rather than hurt, Dukakis by ``unwittinglyacting as a lightning rod for all of the liberal bogey men the GOPcustomarily uses to scare the electorate about the Democrats,''said John Brennan of ABC.   Jackson beat Dukakis among all liberal primary voters, but hisoutspoken brand of liberalism made Dukakis look all the moremoderate. The Massachusetts governor won overwhelmingly amongmoderates and conservatives, ABC found.   ABC's poll from May 19-25 gave Dukakis 53 percent support fromregistered voters to Bush's 40 percent. The margin of error for thesurvey's 1,172 registered voters was plus or minus 3.5 percentagepoints.   The Iran-Contra affair continues to dog Bush, with a majority ofthe public still doubting that he is telling the truth in thescandal, ABC said. The legal problems of Attorney General EdwinMeese III and other administration woes are also taking their toll,ABC found, and many Americans seem ready for a change.   What is most puzzling to the pollsters, however, is the public'snegative perception of the economy, which could spell problems forBush in November. About 42 percent see the economy on a downwardtrend, even though it has been performing better than anticipatedafter last fall's stock market collapse.   ``There's a direct correlation between who you're going to votefor and your view of the economy,'' says Alderman. ``Theadministration seems to have done everything it possibly could togoose the economy along ... But we do not have a majority sayingthe economy is in good shape.''   ABC says Bush won his primary race by taking advantage of astrong organization in the weeks before the multi-state SuperTuesday primaries.   Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas matched Bush in fame and money, andenjoyed a burst of momentum from his opening-day victory in Iowa.But, says ABC polling analyst Kelly Hanley, Bush benefited from thefact that Republicans still had positive feelings about RonaldReagan.   ``Huge majorities of voters wanted to stick with the courseReagan had set, and those people voted for Bush,'' Hanley said.   On the Democratic side, Dukakis outpaced his rivals with aclever strategy of conceding some losses in the South whileconcentrating on the more cosmopolitan Southern states, includingdelegrate-rich Texas and Florida. He steamrolled through hisNortheastern home turf, weathered defeats in Illinois and Michiganand rebounded to clinch the nomination.   ABC polls showed that Dukakis drew strength from Hispanics, Jewsand whites in general. And while opponents criticized his lack offoreign policy experience, ABC polls showed that primary voterscared little about the issue.   Dukakis now appears to be running strongly among Jackson's blackconstituents. While Jackson captured 90 percent of the blackprimary vote, registered blacks chose Dukakis over Bush by 80percent to 12 percent in ABC's May poll. Only 6 percent said theywouldn't vote if Dukakis were the nominee.   In the May survey, Dukakis outpolled Bush on personal qualitieslike whether he ``cares about people,'' is honest, gets thingsdone, has a vision for the future, can be trusted in a crisis andis an able leader. But Bush was perceived as more experienced.   The Massachusetts governor was seen as more able to help thedisenfranchised, keep the United States out of a war and reduce thedeficit. Bush was perceived as better at keeping a strong nationaldefense.   Sixty-four percent of Americans had a favorable impression ofDukakis, compared with 50 percent for Bush. Only 11 percent had anunfavorable impression of Dukakis, compared with 35 percent forBush.   ``Dukakis may be getting his biggest boost from disaffection wihthe Reagan administration in general and Bush in specific,'' saidBrennan.   Bush is having trouble assembling the same coalition ofconservatives and disaffected Democrats who twice gave Reagan bigvictories, ABC found.   He is holding on to his core Republican supporters, but theymake up only a quarter of the likely electorate. He is losing theindependent vote and is weak among the Democrats who defected toReagan in 1984.   Surprisingly, a third of those identifying themselves asconservatives said they support Dukakis, as do 43 percent of whiteborn-again Christians. Dukakis gets two-thirds of the registeredwomen voters, a fact that alone explains his lead in the horserace.   All this does not necessarily pre-ordain a Dukakis victory, saysAlderman, who believes that Dukakis' high May favorable rating is apeak.   ``Until the final couple of weeks, the public doesn't focus onthe race that intensely,'' he says. ``So there's plenty of room forchange.''</TEXT></DOC>
