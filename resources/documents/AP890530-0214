Gun manufacturers, noting the trend, havecome out with special weapons for women, and even a little pistolfor joggers that fires right through its wallet-holster.</TEXT><TEXT/><NOTE>By JOHN BARBOUR</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Terry Weber, a soft-spoken sharpshooter inthis Midwestern city, sometimes answers the door with a gun on herhip. On the firing range, she practices her marksmanship againstreal-life assailants with wax bullets.   In New York City, where a woman jogger was attacked and raped bya roving gang in Central Park, Thalia Adams, 32, practicesregularly at a pistol range. She has twice been the victim of armedrobbery since she moved to Manhattan from Palo Alto, Calif.   Marie Mann, an insurance executive in Cincinnati, has a.380-caliber Bersea. She practices with it in her back yard. Butwould she use it to shoot an intruder or an attacker? She's notsure.   But when a woman takes to shooting, it's usually for reasons ofself-defense, not sport.   No one knows how many women carry handguns on the streets in theUnited States. By some estimates, however, as many as 12 million,one out of eight, have handguns in their homes.   There are no reliable statistics. Neither the Justice Departmentnor the Treasury's department for alcohol and firearms keepsrecords of women who are licensed to carry or own firearms or whorun afoul of the law by their use.   But firing ranges around the country report a significantincrease in the number of female members in the past four years.For instance, Lt. John Benner, who started the Tactical TrainingCenter in Cincinnati, says women once comprised only about 15percent to 20 percent of his beginning classes. Now they amount toabout 50 percent.   Sharon Sullivan, a Cincinnati attorney, can knock a clay pigeonout of the sky on the skeet range at the Moonlight Gun and HuntClub, but she doesn't carry her handgun on the street and wondersabout the wisdom of using it in self-defense. Nevertheless, she'sconvinced police are no longer sufficient protection.   Indeed, police all over the country have told citizens that theyhave an obligation to maintain order and enforce the laws, but theycannot defend every citizen's life or safety every minute of everyday. Citizens must take some responsibility. And indeed the courtshave upheld them.   Some women have taken the warning seriously. They are out therehefting their .44-caliber Magnums from the West Side Rifle andPistol Range in New York City to the Beverly Hills Gun Club inCalifornia. Some even graduate, for sport, to AK-47s and otherautomatic weapons.   Noting the trend, Smith and Wesson has brought out the LadySmith, a version of its popular .38-caliber, scaled down to fit awoman's hand. Another firm, Charter Arms, is offering a his-and-herpair of .38s called the Bonnie (Parker) and the Clyde (Barrow), theBonnie being scaled down in grip and trigger action.   There are all kinds of new products for the would-be gun-toter,including a a little gun for joggers. It fires right through itswallet-holster.   Polls by women's magazines have shown that women are often thesecret victims of crime, and have bought guns for security. ALadies Home Journal poll in 1987 found that 40 percent of 104,000women queried kept guns at home strictly for protection, and 42percent said they had been victims of crime.   Paxton Quigley in her new book, ``Armed andamp; Female,'' acomprehensive look at women and guns, the law and self-defense,says chances of being raped at any age in New York are one ineight; Los Angeles, one in seven; Atlanta, one in five; Detroit,one in four.   ``Across our nation, one out of every four families will bevictims of serious crimes like burglary, rape, robbery or murder,''says Quigley, who estimates that 12 million women have guns intheir homes. ``A Gallup Poll finds that six out of 10 women in thiscountry are afraid to walk in their own neighborhoods at night.''   Quigley, a native of California, was once an anti-gun activist.Then, she says, ``Two things happened in a week's time that changedmy mind. About 2{ years ago a girlfriend of mine heard someone comein her bathroom window about 1 o'clock in the morning. She called911, and waited. She didn't know what to do. It happened veryquickly and the damage was done. The police came 10 minutes later.''   The same week she read a story about a woman who thwarted anintruder with her own .38-caliber special and held the cringingwould-be attacker at gunpoint until the police arrived.   ``But she'd stopped a crime from happening while my girlfriendwas raped. Now 2{ years later she's still not well. So I decided itwas time for me to get a gun.''   Other women coming to the same conclusion have another criticaldecision to make. Should they leave the gun at home, or defy thelaw by carrying it?   Gun activists are careful not to encourage women to carry guns.   If a woman _ or a man _ kills someone who is clearly menacingher life, chances are they will get off by pleading self-defense, awoman especially because of the ``disparity of force'' between herand her attacker.   But no one can avoid the charge of illegal possession of ahandgun, and in most places could face a year in prison. BernardGoetz, New York's subway shooter, is a case in point. He wasacquitted of shooting his young attackers, but jailed forpossession of the instrument of force.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
