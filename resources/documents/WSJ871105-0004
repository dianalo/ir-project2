But Walter Coleman of the Air Transport Association, the trade association for the major airlines, insists that airlines merely are trying to ensure the safety of all passengers. &quot;You want to get that evacuation stream moving as quickly as possible,&quot; he says. &quot;You don't want a bottleneck at the very beginning of it.&quot;    A typical debate in the capital? Hardly. The two sides are having a &quot;reg-neg.&quot;    The term, which is short for regulatory negotiation, represents an innovative and still highly experimental way for adversaries to produce draft federal regulations. In this case, the two sides are quarreling over how the Department of Transportation should implement a law prohibiting discrimination against disabled people by airlines. Normally, the DOT would publish proposed rules, take comments from interested groups, write the final rules -- and watch critics possibly attack the rules in court. In this case, however, the interested groups are trying to hash out their differences before the rules are proposed.    If they do, it's less likely someone will &quot;go running to the courts or Congress to overturn the rule,&quot; says Robert Ashby, the Transportation Department lawyer involved in the reg-neg on airlines.    In the past five years, reg-negs have produced agreements on such difficult issues as worker exposure to MDA, an animal carcinogen used in manufacturing; pollution curbs on wood-burning stoves; and the number of hours airline pilots may work -- a topic so contentious that the rule hadn't been revised since the 1930s.    A major driving force behind reg-negs, proponents say, is Philip Harter, a Washington lawyer. In 1982, he strongly recommended their use in a study for the Administrative Conference of the United States, the federal agency charged with improving regulatory procedures. The agency endorsed Mr. Harter's conclusions, and shortly afterward the Federal Aviation Administration conducted the first reg-negon pilot workdays. Since then, several agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, have tried the process.    &quot;I think it has tremendous potential,&quot; says James Williams, a Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service mediator who recently conducted the MDA talks for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Lee Thomas, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, is one of reg-neg's biggest fans, calling the process &quot;sensible, practical and swift.&quot;    The EPA is so enthusiastic about reg-negs that it has set up a special unit to handle them. In choosing topics for regulatory negotiation, the EPA looks for issues with a limited number of conflicts and a general agreement on the facts. The agency avoids reg-negs that would require an interest group to compromise on fundamental principles. So far, not one of the EPA's three negotiated rules has spawned a lawsuit. By contrast, 80% of the 75 EPA rules developed each year by standard methods are challenged in court.    Reg-negs draw heavily on the labor-management tradition of face-to-face bargaining between adversaries. The talks are conducted by professional mediators -- either employees of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or private mediators. The agency that will be issuing the rule takes part in the process but doesn't run it.    Often, as many as two dozen participants meet in open sessions to try to hammer out agreements. If an agreement is reached, the agency still must publish the draft rule and hear comment, but coming up with a final rule is much quicker and easier.    Still, some question whether reg-negs are the answer. &quot;I'm a skeptic,&quot; says Christopher DeMuth, president of the American Enterprise Institute. &quot;Everybody wants to find ways to make the regulatory process less protracted, litigious and contentious, but whether you can simply do that through a lot of good will and negotiations, I don't know.&quot; Mr. DeMuth also worries that sometimes, in the push to get an agreement by the interested parties, the welfare of the general public may be left behind.    Some critics say that while reg-negs have generated some successes, they have also resulted in some notable failures. In 1986, for example, EPA talks on farm worker exposure to potentially dangerous pesticides collapsed after the workers walked out. Washington lawyer Steven Schatzow, a former EPA official who participated in the talks, blames the breakdown on longtime animosity between the farm workers and the growers.    Such animosity, some say, reflects reg-negs' greatest weakness: Unless the process is used sparingly on well-defined issues, failure is likely. &quot;When things are extremely emotional, and positions have hardened, it can be impossible to work,&quot; Mr. Schatzow says.    Other representatives of public-interest groups say one of the biggest drawbacks of reg-negs is the amount of work required -- usually several months. &quot;It is extremely labor intensive,&quot; says David Doniger, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Pending legislation in Congress would give public-interest groups some compensation for joining reg-negs.    Whatever the outcome of the current negotiations on the airlines and the disabled, the talks have been unique. The meeting sites, which change frequently, have been checked carefully in advance to make sure people who use wheelchairs can attend. Translators have been available to sign for deaf observers. Minutes have been distributed in Braille.    Meanwhile, with a Friday deadline looming for agreement on a draft rule to be issued by the DOT, several difficult issues remain -- in addition to the one on where blind passengers may sit. For example, should airlines be required to take extra steps to communicate safety instructions to deaf passengers? And when should airlines be permitted to deny boarding to disabled passengers who are unattended?    &quot;I can play tennis and basketball,&quot; says David Capozzi, who uses a wheelchair and is taking part in the talks as national advocacy director for Paralyzed Veterans of America. &quot;But some airlines won't let me fly alone.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
