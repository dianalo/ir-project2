The valuesof EGF binding were 12.68 +/- 1.98 (SE; n = 16) fmol/mg protein in gastriccarcinomas and 5.72 +/- 2.15 (n = 8) fmol/mg protein in nonneoplasticgastric mucosa, the difference being significant (P less than 0.01).In the colonic tissue, the binding capacities in carcinomas and nonneoplasticmucosa were 13.29 +/- 4.17 (n = 8) and 10.68 +/- 0.41 (n = 3) fmol/mgprotein, respectively. Scatchard analysis of {sup 125}I-labeled EGF bindingindicated a single class of receptors in gastric and colonic carcinomaswith an apparent Kd value of from 111 to 277 (n = 4) and from 87.4 to341 fM (n = 5), respectively, except for one gastric carcinoma havingtwo classes of receptors (Kd = 15.9 and 896 fM). In Western blottingusing monoclonal anti-EGF receptor antibody, various levels of EGF receptorexpression were detected in 12 (85.7%) of the 14 gastric carcinomas andin 7 (87.5%) of the 8 colonic carcinomas. Immunohistochemically, EGFreceptor immunoreactivity was detected in one (3.8%) of the 26 earlygastric carcinomas, while it was observed in 33 (34.4%) of the 96 advancedgastric carcinomas, the incidence between the two being significantlydifferent (P less than 0.01). In the colonic carcinomas, 47 (77.1%) ofthe 61 cases showed positive immunoreactivity to EGF receptor, whichdid not differ by histological type.</TEXT></DOC>
