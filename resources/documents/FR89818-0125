The Commissionis publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule changefrom interest persons.<ITAG tagnum="85">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substanceof the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>The proposed rule change would modify NSTC's rules as summarized in II.A.below.<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization includedstatements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule changeand discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. Thetext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in ItemIV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, setforth in sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspectsof such statements.(A) <T3>Self-Regulatory Organizations Statement of the Purpose of, and StatutoryBasis, for, the Proposed Rule Change</T3>The proposed rule change formally establishes the Institutional ParticipantServices Program. The Program is designed to provide book-entry settlement,safekeeping and other depository services on behalf of Institutional Participants.Institutional Participants are defined generally as institutions who maintainan account with MSTC pursuant to the rules and the Institutional ParticipantServices Program.Institutional Participants must meet those qualifications for MSTC participationset forth in MSTC article V, rule 1, section 1. That section generallylimits MSTC participation to, among others, SEC-registered broker-dealers;Federal or state supervised or regulated banks, savings and loan associationsor trust companies; state supervised or regulated insurance companies;SEC-registered investment companies; and other qualifying persons, fundsor entities.Institutional Participants must meet the foregoing requirements, as wellas certain other specific financial and reporting qualifications. For example,Institutions subject to state, federal or other governmental regulationmust provide MSTC with copies of all financial reports submitted to regulatoryauthorities. Institutions not subject to such regulation, or if not requiredto file financial reports with regulatory authorities, must provide MSTCwith copies of unaudited quarterly financial statements and audited annualfinancial statements.An Institutional Participant must also promptly advise MSTC of any decreasesof 10% or more in its net assets, or its revenue or income, during anyperiod.MSTC may, in its discretion, require Institutions to provide financialstatements on a more frequent basis. MSTC may also request such other financialinformation necessary to assure itself that an Institution's financialcondition and performance, including information as to the level and qualityof earnings and other generally accepted measures of liquidity, capitaladequacy and profitability, do not create undue risks to MSTC, Participantsor other Institutional Participants.The proposed rule also requires that each applicant to become an InstitutionalParticipant demonstrate (to MSTC's satisfaction) (i) sufficient operationalcapability to utilize the services of MSTC, and (ii) sufficient personnel,operational capability, and physical facilties necessary to fulfill itsobligations to MSTC.In addition, Institutional Participants must (i) have an established businesshistory of a minimum of one year or personnel with sufficient operationalbackground and experience to ensure its ability to conduct business withMSTC, and (ii) maintain a minimum of $5 million in net assets, either directlyor under management. Any applicant with less than $5 million may be admitted,but must demonstrate to MSTC's satisfaction (through a demonstrated planor other documentation) that its net assets (or net assets under management)will reach $5 million within one year of admission as a Participant.Finally, with respect to MSTC's rules, the proposed rule changes amendMSTC's loss recovery procedures in the case of losses incurred as a resultof Participant defaults. Under MSTC's present article VI, rule 2, section4, if MSTC incurs a loss in excess of a Participant's contribution to theParticipants Fund by reason of such Participant's default, the unrecoveredportion of such loss (not recovered through insurance) may be made goodfrom the Contingency Reserve Fund, the Participants Fund or existing undividedprofits and retained earnings, at the election of MSTC.The proposed rule change amends article VI, rule 2, section 4 to providethat MSTC will limit assessments of contributions to the Participants Fundof non-defaulting Institutional Participants to cover losses arising fromdefaults by Institutional Participants; MSTC will also limit assessmentsof contributions of non-defaulting non-Institutional Participants to coverlosses arising from defaults by non-Institutional Participants. An exceptionis made if the loss resulted from Participant defaults involving a transactionor transactions between an Institutional Participant and a non-InstitutionalParticipant. In this scenario, MSTC may assess the contributions to theParticipants Fund of both Institutional Participants and non-InstitutionalParticipants.The foregoing rule changes regarding Participants Fund assessments andallocation of potential losses are designed to balance the statutory goalsof promoting prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securitiestransactions (by encouraging participation by Institutions) and the equitableallocation of dues, fees and other charges. The different treatment inpotential assessments also reflects MSTC's analysis of risks by both Institutionaland non-Institutional Participants. For example, the proposed rules imposespecific risk reduction requirements on Institutions that are similarlynot imposed on non-Institutional Participants, including requirements relatingto minimum net assets, financial reporting, operational background andexperience, and business history. The changes also recognize that Institutionswill receive specific specialized services, including the appointment ofan individual account administrator to assist in monitoring account activity.Contributions to the Participants Fund of both Institutional Participantsand non-Institutional Participants are subject to potential assessmentsin all other cases not involving Participant defaults, including lossesresulting from larceny, embezzlement, or insolvency of a depository (seeMSTC article VI, rule 2, sections 5 and 6).The rule change also contains a Description of Institutional Participants'Services, which are submitted in the form of proposed Procedures. The Descriptionof Services describes the specialized services offered to Institutions,including:<T3>Income Collection.</T3> Institutional Participants will receive cashdividend and interest payments on payable date, regardless of whether thefunds are collected from the Issuer or Paying Agent by payable date. However,MSTC will reserve the right under article III, rule 1, sections 3 and 4to reverse credits within specified timeframes in the case of issuer orpaying agent defaults. MSTC also reserves the right to defer credit ofdividend and interest income until such amounts have been received fromthe paying agent or issuer if MSTC believes or is concerned that the payingagent or issuer will default or fail to make prompt payment on payabledate or anticipated amounts due from the paying agent or issuer are inexcess of amounts available or prudent for advance on payable date.<T3>Customer Support.</T3> Each Institution will be assigned an individualaccount administrator. This account administrator will actively assistthe Institution in monitoring account activity and handling daily operationalinquiries. The administrator will also assist the Institution in processingor resolving certain activities including unusual or unanticipated accountactivity or securities deliveries.<T3>Annual Operational Review. </T3>MSTC will provide each Institutionwith an annual operational review. Institutions will receive a writtenreport regarding the effectiveness of depository utilization and, if appropriate,MSTC will make cost reduction or securities processing recommendations.Finally, the proposed rule change sets forth a Fee Schedule for the InstitutionalParticipants' Services Program. The schedule is structured in several boardareas, including specific fees for Account Maintenance, Safekeeping, Book-EntryTransactions, Physical Transactions, Dividend Reinvestment Programs etc.The fees incorporate MSTC's development efforts in establishing the InstitutionalParticipant Services Program and recognize MSTC's provision of specializedservices to Institutions, including Income Collection, Customer Supportand Annual Operational Review. The schedule, uniformly charged to Institutionsdepending on volume and activity, is also intended to compensate MSTC forthe increased monitoring of Institutional Participants and related accountactivity. MSTC believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') in that it (i)provides for direct depository and clearing agency participation by insurancecompanies, investment companies and other qualifying institutions, (ii)promotes the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securitiestransactions in the National Clearance and Settlement System by qualifyinginstitutions, and (iii) provides for the equitable allocation of fees forservices for such Institutions. (B) <T3>Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition.</T3>MSTC does not believe that any burdens will be placed on competition asa result of the proposed rule change. C. <T3>Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the ProposedRule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others </T3>MSTC has not received any comments from Participants on the proposed rulechange. <ITAG tagnum="84">III.
