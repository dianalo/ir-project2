<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-62-0875 </DOCNO><TEXT>A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism for propene oxidation is developedand used to model reactions in a static reactor at temperatures of 575-715K, equivalence ratios of 0.8 - 2.0, and a pressure of 600 torr. Modelingof hydrocarbon oxidation in this temperature range is important for thevalidation of detailed models to be used for performing calculationsrelated to automotive engine knock. The model predicted induction periodsand species concentrations for all the species and all conditions measuredexperimentally in the static reactor. Overall, the calculated concentrationsof carbon monoxide, acetaldehyde, acrolein, and propene oxide agreedwell with those measured. The calculated concentrations of ethene arelow compared to the experimental measurements, and the calculated concentrationsof formaldehyde are high. Agreement for concentrations of carbon dioxide,methane, and methanol is mixed. The characteristic s-shape of the fuelconcentration history is well predicted. Modeling calculations identifiedsome of the key reaction steps at the present conditions. Addition ofOH to propene and H atom abstraction by OH from propene are importantsteps in determining the subsequent distributions of intermediate products,such as acetaldehyde, acrolein and formaldehyde. Allyl radicals are veryabundant in propene oxidation, and the primary steps found to be responsiblefor their consumption are reaction with CH/sub 3/O/sub 2/ and HO/sub2/.</TEXT></DOC>
