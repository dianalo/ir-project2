Craig (R-Idaho) introduced a bill, HR 54, requiringappointment of individual agency chief financial officers (CFOs) and &quot;thedevelopment of systems that will provide complete, accurate and timelyinformation.&quot;andM;Craig's bill follows a similar proposal in President Reagan's fiscal 1990Management Report.andP;  In part of the report, Gerald Riso, the Government's CFO,called for both the improvements in the Craig bill.andM;On the House Government Operations Committee, Rep.andP;  Cardiss Collins (D-Ill.)andO;appears to be taking up some of the computer causes of departed chariman Rep.andO;Jack Brooks (D-Texas).andP;  Using the FTS 2000 procurement as an example, sheintroduced a bill, HR 122, calling for an oversight program to improve thecoordination in the executive branch's telecommunications policy-making.andM;Collins is second in seniority on the committee only to its new chairman,Rep.andP;  John Conyers Jr.andP;  (D-Mich.).andP;  During the last two years she has beenactive in the committee's FTS 2000 oversight activities and the move to splitthe contract between two service providers.andP;  She also serves on the HouseEnergy and Commerce Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance.andM;Since the initial proposal for FTS 2000, there has been debate over who mustuse it and what services agencies must use.andP;  Collins' bill tries to stem suchbickering by establishing a governmentwide policy that would cover varioustelecommunications acquisitions.andM;Collins also introduced a bill to amend the Privacy Act.andP;  The bill, HR 126,would re-establish and make permanent the Policy Protection Commission.andP;  Thebill also calls for improving protections on individual information.andM;On other matters, there is a move to remove the Social SecurityAdministration from the Health and Human Services Department and make it anindependent agency.andP;  Rep.andP;  Edward R. Roybal (D.Calif.), a member of theappropriations subcommittee that approves the SSA budget, sponsored the bill,HR 46.andM;The president's budget already gives SSA a separate listing, and Congressreviews the agency separately from other HHS activities.andP;  Roybal's bill couldaffect the agency's massive Systems Modernization Program.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
