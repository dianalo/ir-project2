WallStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> NWA LABORAIRLINES (AIR)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN><TEXT>   Some Northwest Airlines pilots are threatening a work slowdown to protest pay and seniority discrepancies within the airline.    The disgruntled pilots are former employees of Republic Airlines, which was acquired by Northwest's parent, NWA Inc., last year, said Kirk Faupel, a Northwest pilot and union representative for the former Republic pilots.    The pilots, who took deep pay cuts at Republic before it was acquired by NWA, are upset about &quot;substantial&quot; disparities in pay and seniority between the former Republic pilots and other Northwest pilots, Mr. Faupel said.    In recent weeks, posters have appeared in Northwest crew rooms with the message &quot;Zero pay increase, zero airspeed.&quot; Mr. Faupel said he has also received notes and letters hinting at the slowdown, which could disrupt or delay travel for thousands of Northwest passengers. &quot;I'm not sure if its 10 pilots or 100 pilots or 1,000 pilots,&quot; he added.    Negotiations to resolve both issues begin next month at the Minneapolis-based airline, and Mr. Faupel's union, the Air Line Pilots Association, hasn't endorsed the slowdown. But Mr. Faupel said some former Republic pilots have had enough: &quot;The pilots aren't listening to me anymore. They aren't listening to our national organization anymore. Their frustration is simply bubbling over.&quot;    Pilots can hold up planes by operating strictly &quot;by the book&quot; -- for example, reporting mechanical irregularities moments before departure. Such delays could severely disrupt Northwest's hub-and-spoke system, which relies on tightly scheduled feeder flights to move passengers to major long-distance flights. If that system broke down, the large planes would depart late or virtually empty.    Although such operating procedures are legitimate, Mr. Faupel is worried that some angry pilots will &quot;get creative in their flying techniques.&quot; He plans to take to the road next week to warn pilots that such maneuvers could cost them their jobs. &quot;This management would take great pleasure in making some examples,&quot; he said.    Mr. Faupel wouldn't elaborate on maneuvers the pilots might attempt, but said he didn't think the pilots would do anything that would endanger passengers' lives. &quot;They're not kamikaze pilots,&quot; he said.    Robert Gibbons, an NWA spokesman, dismissed the pilots' threats. &quot;Northwest certainly doesn't expect any difficulties. It doesn't have any reason to believe this would go on,&quot; he said.    Mr. Faupel said former Republic pilots are paid as much as 25% less than other Northwest pilots with equivalent jobs. In addition, many pilots have been given lower positions on flight crews since the merger, he added.    Similar disparities have caused trouble elsewhere at Northwest. Some disgruntled baggage handlers have ripped tags off bags and diverted luggage. And the Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into allegations that Northwest mechanics in Minneapolis tampered with aircraft. </TEXT></DOC>
