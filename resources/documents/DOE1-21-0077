The bandgaps of the subcells must be selected for matchedvoltages when operated in parallel. The authors refer to multijunctionsolar cells with the subcells connected in parallel as having a voltage-matchedconfiguration. Computer analyses of multijunction solar cells with avoltage-matched configuration and with series-connected subcells wereperformed. Roughly the same performance was found. Several advantagesfor the voltage-matched configuration relative to multijunction solarcells with series-connected subcells were identified and are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
