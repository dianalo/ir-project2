The chemicals group, Italy's second-largest private-sector company, earned 243 billion lire ($186 million) in the half, up from 227 billion lire a year earlier. Sales slipped 2.5%, to 6.328 trillion lire ($4.87 billion) from 6.489 trillion lire.    Group operating profit in the half fell 16%, to 739 billion lire from 879 billion lire, while parent-company earnings were flat at 80.2 billion lire.    Montedison said its business in the half &quot;was carried out in an international economy characterized by uncertainty and lack of equilibrium.&quot; It blamed the lower sales on the decline in market prices for crude oil products and the weaker dollar.    But the company said its cost-price ratio began to improve late in the half, a trend that continued in July and August.    In a breakdown of results from the group's four sectors, Montedison said sales and operating profits fell in the chemical, energy and pharmaceutical sectors, but rose in the financial-services sector.    Separately, Montedison's 84.6%-owned Erbamont NV unit, a pharmaceuticals company based in the Netherlands Antilles, said it plans a tender offer through an intermediary for the 25% that it doesn't already own of Farmitalia Carlo Erba S.p.A. Farmitalia is Erbamont's main research and manufacturing unit.    About 6.5 million shares of Erbamont's common stock outstanding will be purchased from Montedison for use in the offer. </TEXT></DOC>
