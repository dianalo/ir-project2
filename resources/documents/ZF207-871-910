 The JX-450, Sharp's 300-dpi 11&quot;x17&quot;flatbed (sold also by Howtek) is in wide use as an input scanner.andP;  It is usedboth for position-only work on design workstations and for some desktop colorseparation work.andP;  Sharp sells the JX-450 for $6,995.andP;  It was joined last yearby a smaller sibling, the JX-300 at $4,995, which scans 8-1/2&quot;x11&quot; originals.andM;The JX-450 has performed well as a position-only scanner, but it has facedcriticisms as a reproduction scanner.andP;  Here are the major complaints: thecolor range is limited, especially in the red/orange; the scanner has atendency to produce images with streaks from imperfections in the scanningmechanism, the optics or the CCD array and its electronics; the optionaltransparency attachment is less than ideal; and the resolution, thoughadequate for most continuous-tone color and monochrome images, is notsufficient for the scanner to do double duty as a line-art scanner.andM;This year's show brought forth a torrent of alternative choices, includingone from Sharp itself.andP;  But Microtek took the spotlight by establishing anew, low price point for color scanners.andP;  Suddenly, it is practical for aprospective buyer of a monochrome gray-scale scanner to consider a color unitfor a similar price.andM;Array Technologies at upper endandM;There was excitement at the upper end of the desktop scanner market too.andP;  Wewere intrigued by the new approach to scanning embodied in the Array ScannerOne from Array Technologies.andP;  The scanner is unique in a number of respects.andO;The first is the imaging element, a chip from Hitachi containing a squarearray of photodiode (not CCD) sensors.andP;  There are about 83,000 sensors, in a288x288 array.andP;  Each sensor is divided into four &quot;wells,&quot; for a total ofabout 332,000 wells.andP;  Each of the four wells in each set is covered by a tinyamount of colored dye which acts as a filter, so the chip can directly sensethe level of red, green, blue, and white light at each point of an imagefocused through a lens onto the chip's surface.andM;There are two significant problems to be overcome in using this chip forhigh-resolution scanning.andP;  One problem is that the four wells used to acquireeach pixel are not sampling precisely the same image location.andP;  The second isthat resolutions much higher than 288x288 pixels are needed for publishingapplications.andP;  Array solves both problems by the same technique.andP;  Thephotodiode array chip is mounted on a piezo positioning mechanism.andP;  In thepiezo effect, a material is deformed by an amount proportional to the appliedvoltage.andP;  (&quot;Tweeters&quot; for reproducing high-frequency audio often takeadvantage of this technology.)andP;  In the Array scanner, piezo crystals controlthe horizontal and vertical postiioning of the photodiode array.andP;  The arraycan be moved in very small but very precise increments on both axes, up to amaximum shift of 30 microns.andP;  In four small movements, the chip can berepositioned so that the red wells, the green wells, the blue wells, and thewhite are sucessively reading the same 83,000 pixels.andP;  That solves oneproblem.andM;The other problems, acquiring higher-resolution data, is solved in a similarway.andP;  The array is repositioned in small increments so that each photodiodeelement is exposed to a series of neighboring points of the image.andP;  Through aseries of tiny horizontal and vertical movements, all image areas are sensed.andO;Each array element covers a local rectangular region of the image.andP;  Theserectangular &quot;titles&quot; are then aligned with each other to make up the fullimage, which can have a resolution of up to 4096x4096 pixels.andM;This method of scanning has the advantage that a low-resolution prescan--forcropping, focus, or color adjustment--can be acquired essentiallyinstantaneously.andP;  (Flat-bed linear-array CCD scanners can take half a minuteor so to prescan an image.)andP;  If you want only a low-resolution scan fordesign works, this can likewise be obtained in about one second.andM;Array tells us that photodiodes give better dynamic range than CCDs do, andtheir scanner makes sure it captures the full range of image data by actuallytaking three samples of each pixel: a brief one (to capture highlight data),a long one (shadow data), and one of intermediate length (mid-tone data).andO;The camera can capture up to 12 usable bits each of red, green, and bluedata.andM;The scanner electronics fit in a box that is barely larger than an ordinarysingle-lens reflex camera.andP;  This box can be mounted on a tripod for shots of3-D objects, on a copy stand for scanning flat originals (opaque ortransparent), or on a frame carrying a slide illuminator (for 35mm slides).andM;Image-processing functions available with the scanner include colorcorrection, edge enhancement, gamma correction, and halftoning.andP;  The scannercan be used with a variety of computers, including DOS-based machines andMacintoshes.andP;  SCSI and GPIB interfaces are available, as is an AT-businterface board.andP;  Scanned files can be stored as TIFF, Targa, DDES, and CT2T(Scitex) file formats, among others.andM;The array Scanner-One is intended for sale primarily to OEMs, though thecompany will also sell to end users.andP;  End-user price is $20,000.andM;Barneyscan enhances softwareandM;Barneyscan didn't introduce any new products, but did show a much enhancedsoftware driver package for its slide scanner.andP;  The new software supports aquick prescan.andP;  This lets the user indicate cropping, and allows theadjusting of brightness and contrast, prior to high-resolution scanning.andO;Cropping measurements are reported in user-specified units, so that apublication requiring an image cropped to 21 picas can get exactly that.andO;(Image dimensions can be expressed in inches, picas, centimeters, printer'spoints, or pixels.)andP;  As the resolution and cropping area are changed, thesoftware provides feedback on the size of file that will be created by thescanning process.andP;  The new direct will be available in November, andregistered users can receive free upgrades by contacting Barneyscan.andM;Microtek's audacious moveandM;Microtek took this occasion to jolt customers who thought that color scanningwas beyond their means.andP;  The new MSF--300Z 300-dpi flatbed unit supports both24-bit color and 8-bit gray-scale scanning, and it sells for just $2,195.andO;Adding A Microtek kit to interface it to a PC ($400) or a Mac ($500) stillbrings the complete system in at less than two-thirds the price of thestandard Sharp or Howtek color scanners.andP;  A complete Sun workstation system,ScanVu--Color, coprising the scanner, software and an interface withspecialized firmware, will be available for $4,000.andM;The MSF--300Z uses a 300-element-per-inch CCD array to scan images up to8-1/2&quot;x14&quot;.andP;  It contains 14 brightness settings for each color plane, and itother roughly 125 scaling settings, from 25% to 400%.andM;The interface kits include some well-known software: for the Mac, Avalon'sPhotoMac minus its color separation module (which is offered at a discount)for color image processing, plus Silicon Beach's SuperPaint for monochromework and Digital Darkroom for gray-scale work; for the PC, a Microtek programcalled PC ScanShop--Color, plus Microtek's EyeStar Plus for monochrome tasksand Astral Development's Picture Publisher for gray-scale processing; and forthe Sun, Microtek's Scan Vu 1.2 (an earlier version of which is already inuse with other Microtek scanners), which support monochrome, gray-scale andcolor work.andM;What's the catch?andP;  Such audacious price-chopping raises questions about wherethe scanner's developers chose to economize.andP;  First off, the MSF--300Z mustmake three passes over an image--one each for red, green and blue.andP;  The ratedscanning speed for an 8-1/2&quot;x11&quot; document in 24-bit color is two minutes;this figure will vary depending on the image's size, the desired resolution,and capabilities of the supporting hardware.andM;Or primary importance is the question of quality.andP;  No one--least of allMicrotek--views this scanner as a challenger for, say, Hell's Business.andP;  Itneeds merely to beat, or at least to be competitive with, other entry-levelcolor scanners.andM;Sales potential.andP;  In Microtek's fantasy, the scenario runs like this: Acustomer who is about to drop a couple grand or so on a gray-scale scannerdiscovers that for a few more bucks, the MSF-300Z will deliver gray-scale andcolor scanning.andP;  Boom--the sale is made.andM;We are confident that this scenario will be a common one.andP;  For many people(including the lion's share of our readers), though, a different scene willbe played out.andP;  Having decided that they want or need a color scanner,customers will look around.andP;  Here's the Howtek (or the Sharp; they are thesame machine beneath the skin).andP;  Here's the Microtek.andP;  Is the Microtek's scanquality at least as good as--or not significantly worse than--thehigher-priced machine's?andP;  If so, close the sale.andM;The market will cast its votes soon.andP;  The scanner and Mac interface kit areavailable now.andP;  Support for the Sun386i was scheduled for November 1; for theSun--3 and 4 series, December 1; and for the PC, also December 1.andM;This precipitous price plunge is notable enough that we plan to bring anMSF--300Z in for testing later this fall.andP;  But if you will soon need alow-priced scanner that delivers &quot;good enough&quot; color, here's one model wortha look.andM;Mitsubishi enters the fieldandM;Mitsubishi introduced the SC-7500, a 400-dpi flatbed color scanner for theOEM market.andP;  The scanner uses a linear array of CCDs to scan images as largeas 11&quot;x17&quot; in a single pass.andP;  The speed of the units is excellent: twominutes for a full 11&quot;x17&quot; image.andP;  But its quality is unproven.andP;  The scanneroffers 8-bit analog-to-digital conversion; Mitsubishi guarantees only 6-bitaccuracy.andP;  Both gray-scale and full-color images may be scanned.andP;  Scanningsoftware is being developed for the Macintosh II and Sun-3 workstations.andP;  AGPIB interface is standard for either platform.andP;  The end-user price is$8,950.andM;Mitsubishi Information Systems and Services Division, computer GraphicsDept., 701 Westchester Ave., White Plains, NY 10604; phone (914) 997-4999;fax (914) 997-4976.andM;Sharp and Howtek not standing stillandM;Back in the flatbed pack, Sharp and Howtek were not resting.andM;Sharp's JX-600.andP;  Sharp showed its new JX-600, which scans at resolutions from30 to 600 dpi.andP;  It has the same 11&quot;x17&quot; format as the JX-450.andP;  A special lampunit provides back-lighting for transparencies.andP;  For improved total range,the scanner digitizes the red, green, and blue value of each pixel with 10bits of accuracy and converts this to 8 bits via a table.andP;  (Applicationsoftware can download its own values to this table to adjust for specificoriginals.)andP;  The scanning speed is comparable to that of the JX-450: a coupleof minutes per page, although this varies greatly with the driver software,the resolution, and the image size.andM;The JX-600 costs $14,995.andP;  Sharp experts it will initially find more of amarket with workstation products than with PC-based ones, simply because ofthe enormous file sizes produced: a 24-bit 11&quot;x17&quot; color image at 300 dpioccupies 50 MB; the same file at 600 dpi occupies 200 MB.andM;Sharp also showed a tiny handheld color scanner, the JX-100 (200 dpi, 4&quot;x6&quot;image area).andP;  This isn't likely to see much use in the graphic arts becauseof the postcard-size format, limited resolution, 6-bit-per-pixel tonal rangeand relatively slow serial interface.andP;  But it may compete in some low-endapplications where a video camera and frame grabber would be consideredadequate.andP;  The price is $995.andM;Howtek unveils Scanmaster 3.andP;  Howtek, which has been a major reseller ofSharp scanners, introduced a new machine of its own, the Scamaster 3.andP;  This400-dpi 11&quot;x17&quot; machine, shown at a hotel suite off the show floor, is aimedprimarily at the OEM market.andP;  It has been designed specifically to improve onearlier machines, particularly in total range, avoidance of streak artifacts,and high repeatability of scans (both in a given machine and betweendifferent machines).andM;As an example of the attention paid to details in the design process, Howtekmentioned working with a lamp manufacturer on a special low-variability lamp.andO;This lamp is kept in a dimly lit state between scans, so that it is notsubjected to the temperature extremes of repeated on/off cycles.andM;Unlike Sharp, which went to 10-bit digitizing with its new scanner, Howtekstuck with 8 bits but added a special analog amplifier in front of theanalog-to-digital converter.andP;  The amplifier reduces the image data to a rangethat is adequately handled by the analog-to-digital converter, without losingimage detail at the extremes.andP;  The new machine will distinguish reds andoranges which its predecessor couldn't, and, when scanning a gray step wedge,it will distinguish several more steps.andM;End-user pricing will start around $8,200.andP;  Shipments will begin in December.andM;Siemens shows prototypeandM;Siemens showed a prototype of its 400/800-dpi color scanner, also an OEMproduct.andP;  This is a 3-pass machine that takes one minutes and 22 seconds toscan an 8-1/2&quot;andamp;??x11andamp;?&quot; image.andP;  An initial low-resolution prescan is used toestablish cropping.andP;  RS-232 and SCSI interfaces will be available, and thescanner will come with driver software that includes gamma correction but notimage manipulation.andP;  There is no facility for scanning transparencies.andM;The scanner will cost the end-user around $7,500 when it is released in thefirst quarter of next year.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
