Michael Steinhardt and George Soros, near-legendary namesin the investment world, are betting that U.S. stocks willdecline. David Rocker and Marc Howard, less famous butrespected managers, are making the same bet.</LP><TEXT>   All four are veteran managers of hedge funds -- risky butoften lucrative private investment funds. As the tableaccompanying this article shows, certain hedge funds havetopflight records, chalking up aboveaverage gains almostevery year (see accompanying chart -- WSJ May 15, 1991).   Hedge fund operators are more aggressive than conventionalmoney managers in several ways. When regular managers don'tlike a stock, they refrain from buying it. Hedge fundmanagers &quot;sell short,&quot; betting the stock's price willdecline. Regular managers earn a fee of 1% or so of assetsmanaged. Hedge fund operators take a big slice of profits(often 20%), and sometimes a fee as well. (Minimuminvestments often run $250,000 to $1 million). Also, hedgefund operators are more likely to use options and borrowedmoney to magnify investment results, for better or worse.   Here's a rundown on what four leading hedge fund managers-- all skeptical of the market -- are thinking and doing now.                                                                                                          MICHAEL STEINHARDT                                                                                                          &quot;Stocks are overpriced,&quot; says Michael Steinhardt, whosefunds boast a roughly 66-fold return since 1968. &quot;They areovervalued in relation to yield, to book value, and to theearnings outlook, both shorter and longer term.&quot;   &quot;The broad panoply is . . . I'm long bonds and shortstocks,&quot; Mr. Steinhardt says. He has loaded up with Treasurynotes and bonds and sold short more than 80 stocks. (He'salso betting against the stock market with stock-indexfutures.) In contrast to past occasions when he has describedhimself as &quot;modestly short&quot; stocks, he is heavily short now.(A short seller borrows stock and immediately sells it,hoping the price will go down. Eventually, he must buy newshares to return to the lender, but if the price dropssufficiently meanwhile, he profits.)   One reason Mr. Steinhardt prefers bonds to stocks: Hefigures &quot;the economic recovery that is profoundly reflectedat current {stock-price} levels will be later in coming andweaker&quot; than most people think. Also: &quot;The supply-demandrelationship,&quot; so favorable to stocks in the 1980s, isturning sour, he says. &quot;As long as the market stays up, itwill be greeted by a vast and continuous supply of newequities.&quot; And money managers already have spent most oftheir cash, raising the question of who's left to buy stocks.                                                                                                          GEORGE SOROS                                                                                                          &quot;We are as negative about the prospects for the U.S.equity market . . . as we have been in a long, long time,&quot;says a spokesman for Soros Fund Management, whose QuantumFund (open only to foreign investors) has turned a 1969investment of $1,000 into $462,000.   &quot;We believe the stock market is in a Catch 22 situation,&quot;says the Soros official. If the economy recovers, the firmbelieves interest rates will quickly jump -- killing thestock rally that has fed on lower rates. But if the economydoesn't recover, that would be even worse, because the DowJones Industrial Average &quot;has already rallied 600 points&quot; onthe assumption that a recovery is just around the corner.   Soros Management also dislikes the supply-and-demandpicture for U.S. stocks. &quot;It's the inverse of the 1980s,&quot;when the amount of stock available shrunk by $400 billion,the spokesman says.   Aren't Soros managers impressed that the Federal Reservehas cut the discount rate (which it charges on loans tofinancial institutions) three times within a few months?After all, such cuts in the past have consistently precededbig stock-market gains. No, that's reasoning from a &quot;Pavlov'sdog mentality,&quot; says the Soros spokesman. &quot;Every other time{the Fed cut rates}, you were about to undergo fiscalstimulus.&quot; This time federal, state and local governments arelikely to tax more and spend less, a recipe for slowing theeconomy.                                                                                                          DAVID ROCKER                                                                                                          &quot;We're in this mindless phase where bad news is perceivedas good news,&quot; says David Rocker, head of Rocker Partners.&quot;There's this view out there that nothing can go wrong.&quot; LikeMr. Steinhardt, Mr. Rocker prefers bonds; in stocks, the sizeof his holdings and short sales roughly offset each other.   Among stocks he owns are Datascope, Porta Systems andHechinger. Rocker Partners owns 11% of Datascope, a maker ofmedical products including monitoring instruments forsurgery. Datascope &quot;has a very clean balance sheet&quot; and apromising new product that seals punctures in patients'arteries, says Mark Cohodes, Mr. Rocker's partner. Datascopethinks the new product could double its sales, he adds.   Porta Systems makes equipment for connecting andprotecting telephone lines. Debt free, it sells for only 13times per-share earnings, even though it boasts a 20% returnon equity and a 20% profit growth rate, Mr. Rocker says.Hechinger is a home-improvement chain in theBaltimore-Washington area that he says is benefitting fromconverting to a superstore format.   Mr. Rocker is short-selling quite a few smaller medicalstocks. They &quot;have been vast overperformers,&quot; he says. &quot;TheStreet's in love with them, just when the government andcorporations are looking for ways to cut {health care} costs.The new-issues pipeline is full of them.&quot; He is also shortingMichael Foods, a debt-laden company that he says benefitedlast year from above-trend egg prices.   Egg prices have fallen recently, and industry sourcesexpect them to keep dropping. This makes a down secondquarter likely, Mr. Rocker says. In addition, Cargill isentering the liquid-egg market, one of Michael's specialties.                                                                                                          MARC HOWARD                                                                                                          &quot;The market's been up because of Fed easing . . . . andthe hope that the recession will be over quickly and we willgo on our joyous way forever,&quot; says Marc Howard, partner atJRO Associates. But he is more bearish than that. &quot;At thispoint, the Fed has eased significantly, the recession isn'tover, {and} the prices in the market reflect a decentrecovery in the economy starting fairly shortly.&quot;   Mr. Howard says he is short-selling personal computermakers, following severe price-cutting by Compaq and Toshiba.He is also shorting disk-drive stocks, and fledglingbiotechnology issues where &quot;what you're really doing iscapitalizing wishes and dreams at several hundred milliondollars.&quot; But one technology stock he likes is LaserPrecision, which makes test equipment for fiber-optic lines.   He owns Hillhaven and Integrated Health Services, both inthe nursing home field. &quot;These companies,&quot; he says, &quot;aredependent on the world getting older, which I think is a lotsafer bet than the economy getting better.&quot;                                                                                                          THE SILENT ONES                                                                                                          Officials at Tiger Fund, which has achieved a 32% compoundannual return for 11 years, and Ursus Partners, whereshort-seller James Chanos reigns, declined to be interviewed.   Wall Street scuttlebutt is that Tiger's Julian Robertsonlightened his stock positions in late April, after being veryheavily invested early this year. Mr. Chanos is said to haveintensified his short selling at about the same time.</TEXT></DOC>
