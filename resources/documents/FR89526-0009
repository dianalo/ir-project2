TheCommission concluded that judgments and settlement payments in such proceedingsshould be recorded in the Uniform System of Accounts in Account 7620, ExtraordinaryIncome Charges. The Commission normally does not allow carriers to recoverthe costs in that account through the ratemaking process. It noted, however,that the accounting classification does not bar recovery of those costsfrom ratepayers, but rather places on the carrier the burden of proof toestablish that judgments and settlements should be recognized as part ofits revenue requirement and borne by the ratepayers. The Commission allowed the carriers to continue to record the expensesassociated with defending charges of Federal law violation in the operatingaccounts normally recognized for ratemaking. However, the Commission modifiedits policy with respect to the ratemaking treatment of such expenses. Ifa carrier settles a suit alleging such violations after entry of an adversejudgment, or if a final adverse judgment is entered against the carrier,the cumulative litigation expenses incurred in the case will be disallowed,with interest, in the next appropriate tariff proceeding. Six carriers filed petitions for reconsideration of the <T3>Report and Order</T3>. Collectively, they disputed both the accountingtreatment of judgments and settlements and the policy allowing litigationexpenses to be ``recaptured'' through the tariff process. They also assertedthat the Commission should be concerned about litigation costs, if at all,only in a limited number of proceedings. The Commission rejected the argument that the rules and policies adoptedin the Report and Order should apply only in cases involving allegationsthat the antitrust laws have been violated, or only in some other limitedtype of proceedings. It stated that the policies and rules become effectivefor the most part only after a court has determined that the carrier hasviolated a federal law. In this situation, the entry of an adverse judgmentjustifies placing the burden of proof on the carrier to show why the expenseshould be considered a normal part of its provision of service. The rulesand policies balance the need to distinguish between violations that raisepublic policy implications and judgments that deal with local matters,such as tort actions. The rules provide uniformity in how judgments andsettlements are recorded for accounting purposes, while the Commission'swillingness to consider violations on a case-by-case basis establishesa safety value when the accounting treatment would produce unfair ratemakingresults. Finally, the Commission noted that the carriers will be familiarwith all of the circumstances surrounding the proceeding and thus are betterplaced than the Commission or third parties to challenge the presumptionresulting from the accounting treatment. The Commission again concluded that judgments and settlements should berecorded in an account not normally recognized for ratemaking purposes.The Commission noted that this action did not change its standard of reasonablenessof expenses for ratemaking purposes, but merely changed the presumptionof who must initially demonstrate the reasonableness of the particularexpenditure. Allowability of the costs will finally be determined in asubsequent ratemaking proceeding. The Commission concluded, however, thatthe proper non-operating account for these costs is not Account 7620, butrather Account 7370, Special charges. Although the Commission affirmed its position that amounts paid to settlecases involving an allegation of violation of federal law should not betreated as ordinary expenses for ratemaking absent justification, it adoptedmore specific guidelines as to when carriers may recover such paymentsin their rates. The Commission determined that when a carrier settles acase before a judgment is rendered, a portion of the settlement paymentwill be presumptively recoverable from ratepayers. That portion is theamount  corresponding to the additional litigation expenses, expressedin present value terms which the carrier reasonably estimates it wouldhave paid if it had not settled and which the carrier would have allocatedto the interstate jurisdiction. If the carrier establishes that a reasonableestimate of the present value of its saved litigation expenses allocableto the interstate jurisdiction is equal to or greater than the settlementpayment, then the entire settlement payment is presumptively recoverablein its rates. If the expenses are less than the settlement payment, thecarrier is free to argue that the difference should be charged to ratepayersbut the carrier must make a showing of circumstances justifying such treatmentwithout the benefit of a presumption in favor of recoverability. The Commissionstated that this presumption will not discourage cost-saving settlementsof frivolous or unfounded claims or permit settlements to be passed onautomatically to ratepayers, and will not embroil the Commission unnecessarilyin time consuming and burdensome procedures for determining the ratemakingtreatment of particular settlements. The Commission also provided examplesof the evidence that the carrier may provide to demonstrate that its estimateof saved litigation expenses is reasonable, and as estimated attorney hoursto complete the case and the hourly rates associated therewith.The Commission considered arguments raised on reconsideration against thepresumption that the Commission will disallow the cumulative expenses incurredin litigating a case if the court renders a judgment adverse to the carrier,even if the carrier thereafter settles the case. The Commission noted thatthe petitioners' arguments in this regard repeat positions considered andrejected in the <T3>Report and Order. </T3>The Commission rejected as speculative the petitioners'claim that the disallowance policy is unduly burdensome, and concludedthat the policy does not defeat the public interest in settling cases.Finally, the Commission rejected arguments that the disallowance of litigationexpenses in proceedings in which an adverse judgment has been issued constitutesretroactive ratemaking. <ITAG tagnum="84">Ordering Clauses </ITAG>Accordingly, it is ordered, That pursuant to sections 4(i), 219, 220, and405 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 219,220, and 405, the Petitions for Reconsideration filed by American Telephoneand Telegraph Company; the Ameritech Operating Companies; Mountain StatesTelephone and Telegraph Company, Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, andPacific Northwest Bell Telephone Company; New York Telephone Company andNew England Telephone and Telegraph Company; and the United States TelephoneAssociation are denied, except to the extent indicated above.
