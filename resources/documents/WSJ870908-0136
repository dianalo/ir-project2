The increase in nonfarm payroll jobs slowed last month and manufacturing employment fell slightly, but economists generally said this was to be expected following July's unusually robust gains. &quot;The economy is continuing to plow ahead,&quot; said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.    Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of Wharton Econometrics in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said, &quot;The economy is growing, but at a moderate rate.&quot;    Separately, the Federal Reserve Board said consumer credit expanded at a brisk 7.1% annual rate in July following a revised 9.4% pace in June. The June increase previously was put at 7.1%.    The Labor Department said the number of people on business payrolls increased by 156,000 last month, after a revised 296,000-job gain the month before. The July growth was originally put at 304,000. Manufacturing employment last month fell by 5,000 after a 91,000-job increase in July.    &quot;It would have been nice to have seen a continuation of the July number in manufacturing,&quot; said James Cochrane, chief economist at Texas Commerce Bancshares in Houston, &quot;but that would have been too good to be true.&quot; Despite the August figure, economists generally contend that export gains have been spurring improvement in the manufacturing sector after a long slump.    Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, told the congressional Joint Economic Committee that weekly factory hours and overtime remain high by historical standards. &quot;The labor-market improvements of recent months held in August,&quot; she said.    Mining employment, which includes oil and gas drilling, increased 6,000 in August, continuing its gradual recovery from the hard times of last year. In the service sector, which produced almost all of last month's job growth, gains were strong in business and health services and in finance, insurance and real estate.    The department's household survey, which is used in calculating the unemployment rate, showed a 354,000-job gain in August after growth of 470,000 in July. The labor force grew by 350,000 last month after a 435,000 increase in July.    Using a measure that counts the military among the employed, the jobless rate was unchanged in August at 5.9%. Joblessness declined to 12.4% from 12.6% for blacks and to 5.2% from 5.4% for adult men. Unemployment fell to 5.3% from 5.4% for adult women. It jumped to 16% from 15.5% for teen-agers and rose to 8% from 7.9% for Hispanics.    Average hourly earnings rose to $9.03 in August from $8.96 in July. The department's hourly earnings index, which excludes wage gains caused by factory overtime and shift differentials, increased to 173.9% of its 1977 average from 173.2% in July.    Average weekly hours worked last month rose to 35 from 34.8 the previous month. Average weekly factory hours were unchanged at 41 and manufacturing overtime held steady at 3.8.    The Fed report showed that consumer credit expanded $3.46 billion in July after rising $4.55 billion in June. Among other factors, auto credit slowed somewhat from its rapid June pace. Automobile borrowing expanded $951 million in July after a $2.55 billion increase in June.    Revolving credit, which includes retail and bank-card borrowing, rose $1.3 billion in July after a $532 million rise in June. Mobile home credit rose $173 million after a $143 million expansion the previous month. The Fed's miscellaneous credit category, including cash loans and certain retail transactions, increased $1.03 billion after a $1.32 billion rise.    At the end of July, consumer installment debt totaled $591.18 billion, up 6% from a year earlier.    The figures in both the Labor Department and the Fed reports are adjusted for seasonal variation.    Here are excerpts from the Labor Department's employment report.
