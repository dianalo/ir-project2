Why is it that to printthe supervisor must define the printer devices with PRINTDEF and set up printjob configurations with PRINTCON, while the user must use PCONSOLE to managethe available queues, issue an inanely complex CAPTURE command beforeentering an application, then bring up the document, print the document, exitthe application and then issue an ENDCAP command? it is a completely tediousprocess that infuriates the most stoic and causes the blood to boil in usmore anxious types.andM;It is no wonder there are hundreds of products on the market to simplifyprinting on a NetWare LAN.andP;  Anyone could do better than the dolts at Novell.andM;One company, which did much better than did the dolts at Novell, isBrightwork Development.andP;  It created a product called PS-Publish.andP;  Not onlydoes it simplify Netware printing, it turns an HP LaserJet into aPostScript-compatible printer.andP;  This makes desktop publishing on the networkmuch easier.andP;  Programs like Ventura and PageMaker can easily share ahigh-quality printer with little worry.andP;  Plus, PS-Publish is completelyintegrated with NetWare's printing scheme.andP;  Thus, if some users still insiston using NetWare's arcane commands, PS-Publish will work right along withthem.andM;InstallationandM;PS-Publish is really a combination of two existing products.andP;  One is PS-Printfrom Brightwork.andP;  it allows any PC on the network to be a printer server,rather than just the file server.andP;  its pop-up components help users managequeues and print jobs and issue CAPTURE and ENDCAP commands from within anynon-graphics application.andP;  The PS-Print included in PS-Publish is an enhancedversion.andM;The second product is PC Publisher Kit from QMS in Baton Rouge, LA.andP;  Itconsists of two special add-in boards, one for a PC and the other for an HPLaserJet, a cable between them, and printer driver software to run them.andO;Once installed, it turns the LaserJet into a PostScript-compatible printer.andO;it also adds support for the QMS Document Description Language (DDL), whichsome applications, like Ventura Publisher, support.andM;Our installation of PS-Publish went quite smoothly.andP;  We installed the two PCPublisher Kit boards, one in the PC designated as our printer server and onein the LaserJet, and connected them in just a few minutes.andP;  Next, we ran theinstallation program which copied all the appropriate files, including systemfiles, utility files, Ventura Drivers and Windows drivers, to the file serverhard disk.andP;  We then added the command to load the hardware and printerdrivers into the PC's AUTOEXEC.BAT file.andP;  A more efficient alternative wouldbe to execute the commands from the NetWare Login Script.andP;  We didn't do thisbecause our Login Scripts were set up for other tests we were running on thenetwork.andM;The next step was configuring applications to use the PC Publisher Kit.andP;  ForWindows, this meant adding the printer drivers (PostScript-compatible andDDL) using the CONTROL panel.andP;  For Ventura, this meant selecting theappropriate .WID files which come with PC Publisher Kit (IPS.WID andDDL.WID).andP;  In WordPerfect, this meant selecting the appropriate PostScript orLaserJet printer driver you'll need the network version).andP;  Other applicationshave different requirements.andM;We tested the PC Publisher Kit by itself to make sure it was working beforegoing on to install the rest of PS-Publish.andP;  We had no trouble getting Excel,Ventura and PageMaker files printed quickly.andP;  in fact, the processor on thePC Publisher Kit board reduced the printing time dramatically, cutting thetime it took to print a complicated document in half.andM;We were now ready to installing the PS-Publish software, which took all oftwo minutes.andP;  The installation program put all the files into the appropriatedirectories on the NetWare file server and we were ready to roll.andP;  GettingStartedandM;To get PS-Publish running requires two programs be loaded into memory at theprinter server: PKLOAD and PS-PUB.andP;  The first is the hardware driver for theadd-in board.andP;  The second is the print driver which sets up thecharacteristics of the print server.andP;  Both have a simple command structurebest executed from a NetWare Login Script.andM;We loaded the two drivers from the command line using the defaults and wereready to test PS-Publish.andP;  We moved to a user machine and executed a NetWareNPRINT command to print a sample PostScript document that comes withPS-Publish, BRIGHT.PS.andP;  As required by the NPRINT command, we had to specifythe queue for printing, which in this case was called QPost.andP;  it was one ofthose queues &quot;introduced&quot; to the network by the loading of the print driverPS-PUB.andP;  That is, the PS-PUB driver establishes NetWare queues that printjust like any other NetWare queues, only on the printer server machine.andP;  OurNPRINT test worked right away.andM;Next, we ran the PS-Publish console program, PSP-CON, at the printer serverand tried our NPRINT command once again, this time using a DDL file,SAMPLE.DDL, and the QDDL queue.andP;  PSP-CON displayed the activity of thequeues, telling us which job was printing and what its status was.andP;  PSP-CONcan be installed as a terminate-and-stay-resident program, if desired.andM;Once we were printing with NPRINT, it was time to try printing over thenetwork from some applications.andP;  But first we tried the PS-Publishconfiguration program.andM;ConfigurationandM;PS-Publish comes with a configuration program that has two options, PrinterQueues and Printer Configurations.andP;  Under the first option users may addqueues, specifying their users, their servers and their operators (NetWareterms).andP;  These queues, which must have POST in the name if they arePostScript queues or DDL if they are DDL queues, can then be used whencreating printer configurations.andM;Printer configurations may have several queues, each with a different type ofoutput.andP;  For example, a printer configuration may include queues for theprinter using PostScript, DDL or just plain text.andP;  Users may switch betweenthese when printing by using Queuelt! or by printing to the appropriate printqueue with NPRINT or CAPTURE.andM;The significance of the PS-Publish printer configurations is they allow theLAN manager to create several sets of queues to be serviced by the printerserver These can then be chosen on the fly by users or simply used asdefaults.andP;  Loading a different printer configuration requires the executionof a command at the printer server's DOS prompt, but rebooting is notnecessary to make a change.andM;PS-PrintingandM;Once the PS-Publish printer server is up and running, the user has severaloptions when printing a document to the printer server.andP;  One option is to setthe NetWare CAPTURE command, enter the application, print the document, exitthe application, and issue the ENDCAP command.andP;  This can be complicated,because the CAPTURE command requires the user to specify the job, the queue,the port, the time out, etc.andM;Another option is to set everything beforehand in PRINTCON, then issue asimple CAPTURE statement, enter the program, print, exit the program andissue the ENDCAP command.andP;  A variation on this option is to set a time out inPRINTCON.andP;  This will eliminate the need to exit the program and issue theENDCAP command.andP;  This is the way most people print with NetWare.andP;  The onlydifferences PS-Publish makes is that the PRINTCON print job configuration mayspecify a device attached to a printer server and that this device may be aPostScript-compatible printer.andM;The third option is to use the PS-User program that comes with PS-Publish.andO;It is a TSR program that allows the user to execute the CAPTURE and ENDCAPstatement from within an application.andP;  it only works in non-graphics andnon-Windows applications.andP;  With PS-User, PRINTCON jobs are assigned to aprinter port.andP;  This effectively turns CAPTURE on.andP;  When the job is done, theuser may use PS-User to issue an ENDCAP statement, thereby printing thedocument.andM;A fourth option involves another program, called Queuelt!, that Brightworkoffers separately from PSPublish.andP;  This program works just like PS-User,except it also allows users to alter PRINTCON-defined print jobconfigurations from within another application.andP;  For example, a user mightenter WordPerfect, decide to print a document but use a different PRINTCONprint job configuration than originally planned.andP;  With Queuelt!, the userpops up a screen and selects a print job configuration.andP;  The job may then beedited, including time out, banner, queue, auto endcap, etc., as if the userwere actually running PRINTCON from within WordPerfect.andP;  All changes madewith Queuelti are reflected throughout NetWare's print utilities.andP;  This is atremendous convenience because it allows users to edit their print jobconfigurations on the fly.andM;Queuelti should work on graphics applications, but not on Windowsapplications, according to Greg Gianforte, president of BrightworkDevelopment.andP;  We had trouble running it with Ventura on an Everex machine.andO;Given the strange system board messages we received we suspect the Everexmachine.andP;  We did not have a chance to try the combination on other machines.andO;Queuelti did work from within WordPerfect without any problems.andM;QueuelT! has the additional advantage of allowing users to NPRINT from withinan application.andP;  This is especially convenient for applications that arenetwork &quot;unaware&quot; or that print to serial ports.andM;Printing with PS-Publish is a breeze once everything is set up, which isn'ttoo long.andP;  Users need not worry about where their print jobs are going, sincePSPublish takes care of them.andP;  it recognizes the type of job it is andswitches to the correct output.andP;  Thus, a user may switch from PostScriptoutput in PageMaker to DDL output in Ventura, without worrying.andP;  All that hasto change is the queue, which may be set either with Queuelti, PS-User orCAPTURE.andM;If this is too complicated, users may simply incorporate the CAPTURE commandinto a batch file for their application.andP;  This will set NetWare up ready toprint.andP;  If the queue is set correctly in this command, PS-Publish will catchthe print job and take the appropriate action.andM;Setting up print jobs is easier too, since it takes only one program PUBCFG),instead of two (PRINTDEF and PRINTCON).andP;  Once jobs are running, thePS-Publish console provides instant, real-time notification of what is takingplace on the printer server.andM;PS-Publish and Queuelt! are easy to use products that eliminate the horrorsof NetWare printing.andP;  They enhance what can be done with NetWare by providingon-the-fly printer configuration and PostScript compatibility.andP;  NetWare usersdoing heavy desktop publishing are crazy not to try them.andM;PS-PUBLISHandM;Brightwork Development 766 Shrowsbury Avenue Building 2 Tinton Falls, NJ07724 201-5 800-552-9976andM;Price:  2,795.andP;
