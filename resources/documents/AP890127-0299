The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Milken'slawyers immediately rejected the proposal from Manhattan U.S.attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani and vowed to battle it out in court ifMilken is indicted on charges of securities fraud and racketeering,which have been expected for months.   Milken's defense team, comprised of some the nation's best-knownattorneys, met with Giuliani aides at the prosecutor's request inthe U.S. attorney's office building, the sources said.   Both sides declined to comment on the meeting, but some of thesources suggested it is unusual for the government to initiate aplea offer if prosecutors believe they have a strong, winnable case.   It wasn't clear what kind of deal Giuliani offered, but therewere unconfirmed reports Milken would have to plead guilty to atleast two felony counts that carry a maximum punishment of fiveyears imprisonment each, pay an unspecified fine and be barred forlife from the securities business.   The sources speculated that in any plea deal, Milken would haveserved at least some prison time and cooperated in the government'sinvestigation of others. Those would include former close associatesand possibly his brother Lowell, another senior Drexel aide alsofacing a possible indictment.   Kenneth Lerer, a spokesman for Milken, issued a statement thatread: ``There are no discussions going on between the U.S.attorney's office and Mike Milken's attorneys, no discussionswhatsoever. For the past 27 months, Mike's position has remainedunchanged. He will vigorously fight any charges brought against himand his lawyers are preparing his defense.''   Milken, 42, is known as the prime purveyor of sub-investmentgrade debt securities known as junk bonds, a key factor in Drexel'sspectacular growth into an investment powerhouse this decade.   He is considered one of the biggest targets in the massive WallStreet fraud probe that stems largely from disclosures bynow-imprisoned speculator Ivan F. Boesky, a notorious inside traderand former Drexel client. Boesky claims Milken and the firm colludedwith him to violate a range of securities laws.   The pressures on Milken to cooperate with the government inreturn for lenient treatment have intensified since last month, whenDrexel buckled under Giuliani's threats of bringing a massiveracketeering case against the firm and left its top financier toface the looming charges by himself.   Drexel agreed to plead guilty to six felonies, pay a record $650million in fines and restitution, settle related litigation with theSecurities and Exchange Commission and strengthen its compliancewith trading rules.   Moreover papers unsealed in Manhattan federal court earlier thisweek revealed Drexel will fire Milken if he's indicted and keep mostof his anticipated 1988 earnings, reportedly in the area of $200million.   Lawyers who have been following the Drexel saga differed on thesignificance of Giuliani's offer to negotiate a plea deal withMilken.   Some said it reflected the politically ambitious prosecutor'sunwillingness to proceed with a complicated case that has anuncertain future. Others said such contacts are common inpre-indictment legal maneuvering.   ``I wouldn't read much significance into this,'' said MichaelFeldberg, a former Giuliani aide who's now in private practice.``It's not like a game of chicken where it matters who started it.''   Of more concern to lawyers was Drexel's agreement to deny Milkenmost of his pay from last year, even though he has yet to be chargedwith a crime.   ``I think that's outrageous,'' Feldberg said. ``...They have anobligation to pay him the money. I don't know whether the guy didanything wrong or not, but if he wants a day in court give it tohim.''   John Stoppelman, a former SEC attorney who now practicessecurities law in Washington, said he was happy to see Milkenintends to fight the charges.   ``You might as well take your shot at trial. Thes cases have away of turning around,'' Stoppelman said. ``The guy is not Jack theRipper you know, they're not crimes against humanity. They'reregulatory in nature.''</TEXT></DOC>
