But bring on the holidayseason. That's when their miracles traditionally happen.;   Is there a betterteam down the stretch than the 49ers? Recent history says no. Since 1986,they've been nearly unstoppable in December, finishing 17-3: 3-1 in 1986; 4-0in '87; 2-1 in '88; 4-0 in 1989; 4-1 in '90. That's the best December recordof any team in the NFL the past five seasons.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ALL 49ERS NEED IS A MIRACLE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Wild-Card Chase; The NFL/Week 14  </MEMO><TEXT>     Since 1981, the 49ers have rallied in their final five games to compile a41-9 mark -- an 82 percent success rate when the cold winds blow, when playersare aching and tired, when the sought-after postseason finally appears inreach.;   &quot;That's the thing about December -- every game feels like a playoffatmosphere,&quot; fullback Harry Sydney said. &quot;It makes you that much meaner, thatmuch tougher.;   &quot;We're going to have to be all of that and more this time,though, that's for sure,&quot;;   Certainly the 49ers (6-6) -- who face the NewOrleans Saints (9-3) at 1 p.m. today at Candlestick Park -- haven't had iteasy this tough season. Injuries have felled quarterbacks Joe Montana andSteve Young. Third-stringer Steve Bono is capable but largely untested. Theirdefense has struggled to stay together without the leadership of Ronnie Lott.;  Yet you've got to like their chances. They've overcome the pits before.;  Remember 1988? That season, the 49ers rallied from a 6-5 start to win not onlythe NFC West but also Super Bowl XXIII, 20-16 over the Cincinnati Bengals.;  The 49ers haven't missed the playoffs since 1982; they know what it takes tobe successful at the finish. While Montana's big-game coolness and comebackmagic was a big factor, their philosophy of self-protection seems to have madethe biggest difference.;   Reason to feel fresh; &quot;I think everybody being ingood health has helped us,&quot; fullback Tom Rathman said. &quot;One thing that the49ers and the coaching staff has always done is they really haven't beat us upduring practice during the regular season. And I feel we're a lot fresher thana lot of teams at the end of the season because of that.&quot;;   The short week ofpreparation for the Saints was a good example of that. The practice schedulewas cut down, to one fairly light two-hour workout a day. Because the 49ersdefeated the Rams 33-10 Monday night, the players got an additional break.;  &quot;No walk-through,&quot; Rathman said. &quot;That was the deal we made.&quot;;   4-0 would betough; But few believe the 49ers will walk through the rest of their schedule,which includes Candlestick Park battles against the Kansas City Chiefs (7-5)and Chicago Bears (9-4). The combined record of their remaining opponents --the Saints, Seattle Seahawks, Chiefs and Bears -- is 31-17.;   So dismal isthe playoff picture that Coach George Seifert doesn't even chance a peek, orpause to think.;   &quot;No -- when it's brought up, sure,&quot; he said, when asked ifhe has considered the 49ers' wild-card chances. &quot;New Orleans is the only thingwe can really spend any time thinking about. We have to get this one.&quot;;   Ramsgame good indication; Monday night's victory over the Rams was a hugeconfidence-builder.;   &quot;We have a tough road ahead of us,&quot; wide receiver MikeSherrard said, &quot;but if we play like we did against the Rams, we'll be inpretty good shape.&quot;;   And as the calendar winds down to its finish, the49ers' chances of winding up in the playoffs could be cranking up.;   &quot;We'restarting to play better as a team,&quot; Sydney said. &quot;When we do that, it doesn'tmatter who we're playing. We can beat New Orleans, we can beat Chicago, we canbeat anybody. We're starting to play better.;   &quot;Every game has been a playoffgame the last two weeks. Every game we play now is like a playoff do-or-die.And we've been pretty good at that in the past, haven't we?&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  NANCY GAY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911201  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  689  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, December 1, 199100336007,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
