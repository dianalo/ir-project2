Over the past few years,quietly and steadily, they have bought homes, started businesses andestablished a central base.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  RADICAL PREACHER'S FLOCK RAISES FUROR INFLORIDA  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     But moving into Lake City has been anything but settling.;    Mostresidents are suspicious of them, and authorities are prosecuting two parentsbecause of one of Meade's teachings: Prayer will heal illnesses, and medicaldoctors won't.;    That belief nearly killed 16-year-old Will Myers inNovember, prosecutors say. Myers' heart lesion, untreated for seven months,made it impossible for him to hold down food. He developed liver and kidneyailments and lost one-third of his body weight.;    But Myers is one of thelucky children, some people say. He is alive.;    Meade refused severalrequests for interviews. In a brief interview in 1989, he said he did notforbid anyone from seeking medical care.;    End Time's faith-healing doctrine-- former followers say Meade preaches that demons cause diseases and thatonly prayer removes demons -- has left a trail of death.;    In five states,from Montana to Florida, at least 12 babies have died without receivingmedical attention since 1978, doctors, police and former followers say.;   Doctors say medical treatment could have saved at least four of them:;   (check) Michael David Boehmer bled to death March 15, 1989, four days afterbirth, in his parents' Lake City apartment. He suffered a nosebleed for threedays; two doctors testified in a medical examiner's inquest that an injectionof vitamin K would have clotted his blood and saved his life.;    (check)Libby Cooke died Dec. 22, 1978, four days after birth,in Brandon, S.D. Thebaby, born prematurely, had difficulty breathing two days after birth, saidthe mother, Joni Cooke Eddy. She and others prayed for the baby. Doctors latertold her that 90 percent to 95 percent of babies in similar condition can betreated easily.;    (check) Sarah Handy died from pneumonia July 1, 1981,about 10 hours after birth, in Sioux Falls, S.D. A doctor told police that thepneumonia could have been treated and that &quot;any reasonable person should havecontacted a physician.&quot;;    (check) Baby Ruzicka was stillborn Feb. 8, 1981,in Sioux Falls, S.D., after the infant's mother, Cathy Ruzicka, was rushed tothe hospital. She had been in labor for five days, according to Bev Aulner,Ruzicka's mother. A death certificate says the full-term infant died from lackof oxygen because of the mother's high-blood pressure, which doctors say couldhave been diagnosed in prenatal care.;    At least two adults also have diedwithout medical attention. One was Marie Meade, 63, the first wife of EndTime's founder. Breast cancer killed her.;    END TIME'S origins were in atiny Muncie, Ind., fundamentalist church.;    Charles Meade -- born inPaintsville, Ky., one of 15 children of fervent fundamentalists, a World WarII veteran and a longtime worker at Ball Manufacturing Co. in Muncie -- becameactive in the Muncie church during the early 1970s. He was near retirement, inhis late 50s.;    The church's guest preachers included one otherself-proclaimed prophet: Hobart Freeman. It was Freeman, sect defectors say,who convinced Meade of the correctness of faith healing. Freeman was startingthe Faith Assembly church -- from 1973 to 1984, Indiana officials documenteddeaths of 94 Faith Assembly members who received no medical care.;    Meadebegan circulating tapes of his own sermons; one group of listeners werecollege students at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. The students,who later became Meade's most trusted lieutenants, brought his message totheir hometowns, including Sioux Falls and Billings, Mont.;    Meade'steachings weren't so different from those of other fundamentalist preachers.But he made some startling claims.;    Meade said that the end of the worldwould come in his lifetime and that Jesus Christ had told him this. He said heactually had met God. And he said he had walked among the stars in the MilkyWay, said Eddy, who left the group in 1986 after Marie Meade's death.;    Inhis long, rambling sermons, Meade also told followers that medical doctorswere tools of Satan. Followers who seek medical care are not among the truebelievers, he preached.;    FOR MORE than a decade, Meade made trips fromIndiana to his satellite groups, where elders recruited and taught members.Then, on a vacation to Florida about eight years ago, Meade drove into LakeCity.;    Here, he told his followers, was Canaan, promised by God to Abrahamand his descendants.;    Meade, who turned 74 on Christmas Eve, bought a houseand 23 acres of land. Soon his flock began a southward migration.;    Meademoved into a subdivision called Southwood Acres. Followers vied for homes nearhis corner lot. With the help of End Time real estate agent Charley Sparks, 27of 59 plots in the subdivision now are owned by group members.;    Longtimeresidents soon became prickly toward the group. For one thing, Sparks, whodeclined an interview request, was knocking on their doors and asking them tosell their homes. For another, these newcomers were secretive.;    Memberswouldn't say where they came from. They wouldn't talk about their religion.And their children were kept out of public schools; more than 200 End Timechildren are being taught at home.;    In Lake City, though, not everyonelined up against them. Mayor T. Gerald Witt shocked townspeople after theBoehmer death by saying, &quot;It may be necessary for some babies to die tomaintain our religious freedoms. It may be the price we have to pay;everything has a price.&quot;;    But when Hudson and Judy Ayers asked neighborswhether they wanted to talk about the group with a reporter, 17 people showedup on 24 hours' notice one recent evening.;    Sitting around the Ayers'living room, with a painting of the Last Supper hung above their heads,residents made charges against the group -- charges that police haven't beenable to substantiate.;    The residents said that End Time members had runthem off the road with their cars and that members patrol the neighborhood andhurt their dogs.;    Hudson Ayers, a school psychologist, said, &quot;We havegotten to the point that we simply won't be chased away. We've had neighborswho have left feeling like they were fleeing for their lives.&quot;;    End Timemembers aren't worried about what others think.;    &quot;These are the last days,&quot;said a member who declined to give his name. &quot;A lot of people here hopebecause of the effort Charles Meade has made that God would see that he has apeople ready. We are ready to present ourselves as a fine and spotless bride.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JOHN DONNELLY, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Lake City, Fla.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910108  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,215  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday January 8, 199100008176,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
