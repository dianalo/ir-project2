One Wall Street analyst who asked not to be identified said a large client called Friday and spent an hour discussing questions about General Electric Credit and its potential for &quot;bad debts, receivables, and write-offs.&quot;    Joked another analyst: &quot;My concern is, at what point does this conglomerate trade at a bank multiple rather than as a highly tuned, well-oiled growth company?&quot; GE trades at 14 times estimated 1987 earnings, only a slight discount to the overall market. Banks and other financial companies sell at far lower multiples.    GE says that -- on the contrary -- the weakness in some markets provides &quot;an opportunity&quot; for even greater growth as some financing competitors pull back. Dennis Carey, general manager of corporate financial services at GE Credit, says, &quot;The majority of our deals are (based on) future cash flows. And we believe the cash flows will be there.&quot;    Along with television broadcasting, financial services has been a big piece of GE's diversification from its cyclical manufacturing roots. Financial services contributed about 20% of GE's earnings last year, with GE Credit accounting for four-fifths of that and the Kidder Peabody brokerage unit and an insurance unit making up the rest.    Although GE Credit has a widely diversified mix of business, its participation in about 100 leveraged buy-outs is one lightning rod for concern. The GE unit has often taken so-called &quot;mezzanine&quot; financing positions in such buy-outs.    Mezzanine debt is somewhere between straight debt and equity. Other debts may come first in claims for repayment. On the other hand, it usually carries equity rights in addition to interest.    Many LBOs have also been financed by junk bonds. Since stocks crashed last month, the junk market has also tumbled on concerns about economic weakness and the ability of junk-bond issuers both to make their interest payments and to sell assets at prices they had expected.    One analyst who acknowledges that GE Credit has been &quot;phenomenally successful&quot; at financing LBOs warns that transaction-oriented businesses, which contribute the majority of GE Credit's earnings, can be quite volatile.    Despite the new questions, several other analysts who follow GE say they don't foresee much of an earnings impact. &quot;The LBO business has been growing rapidly for them. But no business is particularly critical to GE Credit,&quot; says Gail Landis of Sanford C. Bernstein, a brokerage and money-management concern.    &quot;The only near-term effect is that it will inhibit GE's ability to take capital gains in the equity participations of its leveraged buy-out portfolio,&quot; says Martin Sankey of First Boston. He says clients have asked whether GE's financial-services unit can keep growing.    GE Chairman John Welch has projected that profit of the business, which roughly tripled in 1981-86, can double between 1986 and 1991. Mr. Sankey says he believes the unit can keep to that growth track for at least a few years.    &quot;I suppose the risk parameters are a little different,&quot; said Russell Leavitt of Salomon Brothers. &quot;On the other hand, interest rates are down and that may help them a bit.&quot;    GE Credit's other businesses include financing retail sales and inventories; commercial real estate; mortgage insurance; and aircraft, car, truck and equipment leasing. In early October, GE Credit said it would acquire Gelco, a vehicle leasing concern, for about $250 million.    Mr. Carey says his division of GE Credit has interests in 100 or so companies that have done buy-outs, including R.H. Macy, Tiffany andamp; Co., Wometco Broadcasting, Viacom International and Patrick Communications. He says they will have a total asset value of $5 billion by year-end, or about one-sixth of total GE Credit assets.    Bolstered by the triple-A rating of its parent, the GE Credit unit boasts the highest credit rating of any finance company. Standard andamp; Poor's rates it triple-A, with such competitors as the Associates unit of Gulf andamp; Western at double-A and ITT Financial at single-A-plus. Sandamp;P analyst Richard Schmidt says that while the LBO area will be affected, he doubts it will change the rating.    Daryl Leehaug, a credit analyst at Duff andamp; Phelps in Chicago, says that although there will &quot;likely be lower gains&quot; from mezzanine financings in the future, &quot;GE Credit is so large that basically it's going to go as the economy goes.&quot;    One example of the returns possible in such buy-outs is the Tiffany deal. In return for making a $75 million secured loan, GE got warrants to buy 26% of Tiffany stock -- two million shares -- for $1.25 a share.    GE sold 500,000 shares in Tiffany's public offering last May at $23 a share, an indicated profit of $10.9 million. It kept 1.5 million shares. At their peak of $41 a share last summer, those shares were valued at $61.5 million. Although Tiffany stock has tumbled to $18.125, GE still has an unrealized profit of $25.3 million.    Mr. Carey says that even though the economy may slow down, some forecasters still project growth of 2.5% for 1988. &quot;We don't look at that as being negative for us,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
