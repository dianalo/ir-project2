(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Twenty-six people have been chargedwith selling sexually explicit T-shirts, and some questionedwhether anti-Semitism was involved in their arrest.   Other questions were raised about why bail was set at between$10,000 and $30,000 for each person and why reporters were barredfrom the bail hearings.   Steve Bates, executive director of the state's American CivilLiberties Union, said the bail amounts were an ``outrage.''   ``Jaywalking is more dangerous than these shirts,'' he said.   Many of the beachwear store owners and operators arrested onobscenity charges _ 21 on Monday and five more on Tuesday _ areJewish or are from Israel and said they think that was a factor intheir arrests.   Mayor Bob Grissom called allegations of anti-Semitism``ridiculous'' and said he hopes the arrests ``go a long way towardcleaning things up and make these people aware that if they'regoing to live here they're going to live by our rules.''   Circuit Judge Don Rushing agreed to review the bail set by acity judge at the request of a lawyer for several store owners. Sixremained in jail overnight Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
