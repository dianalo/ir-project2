 Most significant were several SGML-relatedproducts.andP;  There were SGML translators from Software Exoterica and US Lynx.andO;Yard Software, a subsidiary of the Sema Group, announced a PC structurededitor to accompany the Sobemap parser; it is being offered to both OEMS andend users.andP;  These products demonstrate one of the most positive effects ofCALs: the sudden emergence of SGML-related software.andM;Most of the other newsmakers introduced or previewed CALS products or showednew aspects to their technical documentation systems.andP;  Thc exception wasIntergraph, which introduced a batch pagination option for DP/Publishcr.andM;A few vendors-Agfa Compugraphic, Context and Interleaf-showed refinements tosoftware we reported on from this year's Seybold Seminars (Vol.andP;  18, No.andO;14).andP;  ArborText planned to make its CALs debut at the Computer PublishingConference, and SoftQuad said it intends to show several new developments atSeybold as well.andP;  Frame is still not ready to demonstrate its new CALSproduct.andM;One clear theme of last years conference was reiterated this year: theserious players in this market arc investing con siderable resources indeveloping a CALs strategy and product, Those content to offer their standardproduct will be left side the inner circle and will have to settle forleftovers.andM;Datalogics upgrades TPEandM;Datalogics introduced an upgrade to its Technical Publishing Environment(TPE), showed itS CALS subscription service and demonstrated how Pager, itsbatch composition and pagination program, might be used to produceinternational, commercial and government documentation, in kecping with thedifferent themes at this year's conference.andM;PageStation, which is the Datalogics WYSIWYG preview of composed pages, wasshown using the fonts Digital supplies with DECwindows.andP;  The move highlightsDatalogics' intention to move PageStation under DECwindows in the future.andM;PageStation is not an editable display of pages.andP;  Contrary to what you mightexpect, Datalogics says most customers do not use PageStation to check theappearance of composed documents; instead, the product has proved morevaluable as a tool for developing and debugging formats (write format,preview on PageStation, fix errors, preview again and so forth until thcformat gives the desired results).andP;  Once formats are written, customersrarely necd to hand-tune documents, according to Datalogics.andM;The price of PageStation is $10,000.andP;  The company also highlighted itsability to support multiple hyphenation dictionaries simultaneously withinthe same document.andP;  Its distributor in Europe, MR), has completed Dutch andGerman versions of WriterStation (including changing the user interface toDutch and German menus, prompts and errors messages).andP;  Other hyphenationdictionaries supported by Pager include French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish andFrench Canadian.andM;Writer's Edit.andP;  Thc upgrade to Technical Publishing Environment is calledWriter's Edit.andP;  Using its current WriterStation editor, the company has madeit possible to edit groups of pages off-line and have the systemautomatically figure out which pages were changed and generate theappropriate looseleaf pages and list of effective pages.andM;TPE adds a technical document management and looseleaf pagination module toPager, Datalogics' batch- pagination software for DEC Vax computers.andP;  Theenvironment is an editable page database that enables users to update manualsby crcating looseleaf pages.andP;  In addition to the looseleaf software, thcprogram provides a shell, which is an Oracle application, for keeping trackof which pages have been revised at different revision levels.andM;Documents are edited using WriterStation, a PC editor.andP;  The writers cheek outthe pages they want to work on, edit thc pages and return them forprocessing.andP;  In the past, thc writcr had to specify for the system whichpagcs were revised.andP;  TPE then repaginated and updated the status log based onthc information the author provided and the new page count.andP;  Because of thedifficulty in specifying revisions when multiple pages are affected, writerstypically worked on a small number of pages at one time, 'checking them backin and repaginating before moving on to the next batch of changes.andM;The upgrade makes it possible for the writer to pull an entire section, orwork order, of the document and edit it as a piece without worrying aboutwhich pages in the section are affected by the edits.andP;  The systcmautomatically figures out which pages were affected, including generating anew list of effective pages following pagination.andM;In effect, this upgrade brings the Datalogics TPE in line with Xyvision'slooseleaf package, which automatically tracks changes made on-It 'ne tolooseleaf pagcs.andP;  The difference with thc Datalogics Writer's Edit is thatediting takes place off-line: the writer may work on any PC that hasWriterStation, and even take the section home on floppy disk.andP;  If editinglooseleaf pages is a requirement, both products arc worth examining, becausethese are the only two products currently offering an editable page database.andM;Writer's Edit is a free upgrade to TPE users who have the maintenanceagreement.andP;  It is now included as a standard part of the TPE package.andM;Datalogics reports that it now has its CALS subscription service installed atthree sites.andP;  Customers plan to begin putting documents up on the CALS TestNetwork this fall.andM;Intergraph adds batch paginationandM;Intergraph, the only vendor at TechDoc that showed a new product that was notdirectly related to CALS, introduced a batch pagination option forDP/Publisher.andP;  The software is just entering the beta-test cycle and shouldbe available by the end of this year.andM;Batch pagination.andP;  Intergraph's batch pagination is not difficult todescribe; it uses the same routine as DP/Publisher's interactive pagination.andO;The only difference is that it runs in the background on the file server (orany workstation on which it is loaded), rather than as an interactive,foreground task.andM;DP/Publisher uses rule-based pagination similar to that of Compugraphic'sCAPS.andP;  The underlying database is an SGML file of objects.andP;  Paginationparameters for text and graphics arc set as attributes of objects (eg., beginnew recto with a chapter head; float this illustration on the same page asits reference).andP;  The routine is not as sophisticated in correcting bad breaksdifficult graphics placement as the better commercial systems, but it's notbad for initial layout of pages that may then be fixed interactively.andM;The batch routine offers a simple menu of a few items the user decides onbefore running the job:andM;* Command file-the user creates a command file that says which files are tobc assembled in the document, which styles are to be loaded, whether an indexor contents will be automatically generated, whether looseleaf or changecontrol is activated (and they may be activated for portions as well as theentire job), whether the job is to be printed and so forth.andM;* Syntax check-this command is used to verify that the command file is valid.andO;Because the command filc is an ASCII text file, It is possible to edit anexisting one rather than go through the menus.andP;  The syntax check makes sureyou didn't make any errors in the command file.andM;* Test run-this composes the job without generating output.andP;  It is useful formaking sure all of the components specified can be found prior to running theactual job, which might take place overnight or when thc operator is notpresent.andP;  * Run-the batch pagination routine may run in foreground orbackground.andP;  The accompanying log of errors may be displayed or dumped to anASCII file that may be printed.andM;Intergraph estimates the speed of the batch composition and pagination to beabout 12,000 to 15,000 characters a second, or about 3 pp./sec.andP;  for typicalmil-spec manuals.andP;  That makes it one of thc fastest on the market, but, then,its pagination routine is not nearly as sophisticated as that of many of itscompetitors.andM;DP/TechIllustrator.andP;  Intergraph also introduced the latest member of the DPfamily of software: DP/TechIllustrator, a package for illustrating technicaldrawings for publication.andM;The program takes the Intergraph's MicroStation 2D and 3D vector drawingcapability and adds raster editing tools.andP;  Up to 64 raster images may becombined with up to 64 layers of vector data in a single drawing.andM;The user interface is a combination of menus and a command line.andP;  A &quot;pocketmenu&quot; is a customizable palette of frequently used commands displayed in awindow that the user can move freely about thc screen while working on thedrawing.andP;  Wc found this feature handy for reducing the amount of cursordragging common to drawing programs that use large screens and fixedpalettes.andP;  There will be several libraries of predrawn symbols included withDP/TechIllustrator.andP;  Symbols are presented as icons; picking the icon bringsthe object directly into the drawing at thc cursor location.andM;Aside from its extensive drawing tools-which appear competitive with those ofAuto-trol and InterCap-the program has several noteworthy features.andP;  Theautomatic speckle removal feature allows the user to adjust the size ofspeckles to be removed; the user may employ presized drawing boards, whichmay be automatically scaled to the dimension of the screen; the partialdelete function lets you erase along a path; and the trim-to-intersectionfeature not only snaps objects to adjacent objects but also trims lines toend precisely at their intersection.andM;Thc 3D rendering tools make use of DP/Paint, Intergraph's raster imageeditor.andP;  Rendered images may be edited.andM;Text may be added to a drawing using any of 86 supplied Bitstream fonts.andO;Fonts, sizes and character attributes are specified as object attributes.andM;DP/TechIllustrator is a disk-based application, but it is still one thatrequires considerable horsepower.andP;  Intergraph said it expects 8 MB to 12 MBof RAM to be the minimum configuration.andP;  (Its demo machine had 48 MB of RAM!)andO;But, assuming you can afford the box, the software is priced veryaggressively: about $6,500 for a single copy.andP;  The product is scheduled forbeta testing this fall; no exact release date has been set.andM;DP/CALS.andP;  Although it won't be ready until the end of this year, Intergraph'sCALs package is far enough along in development for Intergraph to discuss itscontents.andP;  Thc package will include DP/Publisher and DP/Manager with severalspecial components.andP;  Included will be DP/Convcrter, a utility for reading andwriting SGML files; the CALS DTD; IGES, CGM and CCITT graphics translators;an 1840A tape utility; and one to two days of training.andP;  Pricing has not beendetermined.andP;  Optional extensions will support the use of other DTDs.andM;Winning contracts.andP;  Intergraph has been regarded as a dark horse in thepublishing market, because it has been late in coming to the game.andP;  Now thatit has a fairly robust publishing product in the second release ofDP/Publisher, has completed complementary presentation and graphics packages(DP/Presenter and DP/Paint) and has begun shipping the first release ofDP/Manager (its database manager), the company has die products with which toenter the playing field.andP;  what is surprising is how quickly Intergraph isbecoming a serious challenger in the publishing market.andM;Earlier this month, Intergraph announced that it had won an $87 millioncontract from Boeing to supply NASA with its TMIS system.andP;  The systemincludes numerous workstations loaded with computer-aided engineering, designand publishing software, as weU as some advanced software in design analysisand animation.andM;The publishing side reportedly replaces the Apollo/Interleaf combination thatNASA has in place now and that Boeing includcd in its look at subcontractors.andM;The clincher in the deal was DP/Manager.andP;  Intergraph's database managerprovidcs a consistent interface for users of a variety of applications tomanipulate information stored in one of several SQL databases supported.andP;  Aswe mentioned in our coverage of DP/Manager from this year's Seminars, we finda system-level approach far more elegant than application-based databasemanagement tools.andP;  (Alas, few publishing vendors these days are also platformmanufacturers, which leaves them no choice but to implementpublishing-specific solutions.) NASA and Boeing apparently agreed, and thisprized contract will serve to put othcr vendors on notice that Intergraph isready to win, not just compete.andM;The contract is also a clear indication that Intergraph's software is now upto par in the tech-doc market.andP;  As the company completes its work on CALScompliance, its experience in the government sector should prove invaluablein future competition.andP;  We doubt this will be the last contract it wins.andM;Software Exoterica eyes end usersandM;Exoterica showed its XGML CheckMark running on a Mac II.andP;  The product ha'sbeen offered primarily on an OEM basis in the past, but Exoterica is startingto shift its focus to end users.andP;  Its newest product will bc for end users.andM;Exoterica introduced an SGML translator with which it is possible to convertSGML files into virtually any text processing system, We say possiblc,because Exoterica at this point was able to demonstrate only twotranslations: SGML to the RTF format of Microsoft Word and the MIF format ofFrameMaker.andP;  However, the program offers two-way translation and has the XGMLparser built in, which would enable it to validate and correct the resultingSGML file.andM;Thc XGML Translator is a general-purpose, object-oriented, rule-basedprogramming language combined with the XGML engine that moves files in andout of SGML.andP;  The program currently runs on a Sun workstation and costs$5,000 for a singlc-user development license; $2,500 for a run-time license.andO;Mac and PC versions are planned for later this fall.andM;US Lynx develops SGML ConverterandM;As part of its work with Xerox Custom Systems Division in developing itscALs-compliant solution, US Lynx had to develop an SGML converter for XICS,the underlying format of the XPS systcm.andP;  Rather than develop a product thatcould only be used for one system, US Lynx developed a generic SGML converterthat it will market in conjunction with its data translation software.andP;  TheXerox converter is just one implementation of the underlying technology,which looks vet), appealing for a broad range of applications.andM;SGML Converter.andP;  For some tin-ie, US Lynx has offered sophisticated dataconversion that included support for most typsetting systems.andP;  In its SGMLInstance Imager, it extends its data translation technology to includeunderstanding SGML files and automatically inserting formatting informationbased on &quot;context sensitivity.&quot;andM;This works by incorporating the Datalogics parser into thc product.andP;  Thc DTDis brought into thc system, parsed an converted to binary form to optimizeperformance.andP;  Thereafter, you parse thc instance of a document against theDTD, which includes thc declaration of the document's entities (includinggraphics as well as text).andP;  A document's graphics entities aresystem-dependent, and you can only reference entities that are declared, soit is mandatory that you be able to parse the DTD along with the documentbeing converted.andP;  This capability is true of all systems that claim to beCALs-compliant: you must parse the DTD and its declaration subset in order todetermine the entities to be included and to verify that they are valid.andP;  Thedifference with US Lynx is that your target system may be any one of a numberof formatters, rather than just one.andM;To convert an SGML file, which has no formatting information, into aformatted file for a composition system, US Lynx developed a programminglanguage designed for SGML.andP;  Converting logical gcneric identifiers (tags)into generic tags or specific codes on the target system is not toodifficult.andP;  More difficult is interpreting referenced items, such asautomatically generated cross-references or numbering in headings, lists,tables and so forth.andP;  In the SGML file, such items do not have die actualoutput (e.g., the section or table number) specified; it is created when theformatter interprets the file.andP;  The Datalogics parser used by US Lynxsupports fully qualified generic identifiers, which explicitly state theirancestry in the SGML hierarchy.andP;  US Lynx uses this information to figure outwhere a tag belongs in the logical structure, to map that to a style sheetfor a composition system and to generate any necessary text (such as thenumbers) that should be part of the content in the formatted file.andM;&quot;Context sensitivity&quot; in this system refers to its ability to handle genericidentifiers whose ancestry is only partially identified.andP;  For example, in anautomatically numbered list, the SGML output file may inherit stylecharacteristics from the level above it, rather than state all of its styleinformation explicitly.andP;  If the system were doing a straight datatranslation, some formatting information would not be indicated.andP;  But throughthe use of the parser, US Lynx is able to infer style based on the context ofthc object and insert the appropriate formatting commands that will give theobject the attributes (such as font and size) that may have been inheritedfrom the level above.andP;  It is also able to handle specifically mentionedattributes (rather than just the generic identifiers), which is critical tofully interpreting a file for formatting.andM;(It is worth noting that as more composition systems make use of SGML, morevendors will describe content, such as cross-references or page locks, asSGML attributes.andP;  To interpret a document from such a system will requiremore than mapping generic tags to generic tags; a full SGML parser will berequired.)andM;To put this theoretical discussion in more practical terms, US Lynx claimsthat it already handles placement of graphics callouts, automaticcross-references (both forward and backward), generated lists (contents orlist of illustrations), four levels of index references, revision levels,tables and footnotes, including differentiating between table and body textfootnotes.andM;Another interesting aspect of the SGML Instance Imager is that it keeps theSGML syntax embedded as comments on the target system (assuming that thatsystem supports nonprinting cornments, which most do).andP;  This enables theconverter to offer bidirectional translation in and out of the targetcomposition system.andP;  However, you cannot make edits (other than to fix typos)on the composition system and have them be recorded properly in the SGMLfile.andM;As we mentioned, the first implementation of the SGML Instance Imager is SGMLto and from XICS, done for Xerox and its XPS system.andP;  But US Lynx says itwill develop output drivers for XyWrite Ill and Ventura Publisher as well.andO;The company offers a developer's toolkit with which to write your own outputdrivers, and it is open to developing drivers on an oEM basis.andP;  Included withthe product will be a utility for reading and writing 1840A tapes.andP;  Thus, theuser will be able to accept a CALS tape and convert it to a target system,ready for display on screen or printed output.andM;The SGML Instance Imager is available now for $18,950, which includesWriterStation, SGML parser, instance interpreter, image output driver, andcode reconverter for SGML.andP;  The developer's toolkit costs $39,950.andM;Xerox off to good startandM;We've been waiting for Xerox to demonstrate publicly how it intends to makegood on its promise to deliver a CALS-compliant system.andP;  In its governmentcontracts, the XPS system is the heart of the publishing operation, and Xeroxhas shown little development work on the XPS that indicated that it washeaded in the right direction.andM;At TechDoc '89, Xerox played its opening hand and surprised us with asolution that, while unlikely to lure many new customers in the industrysector, is nonetheless plausible as a means for current customers toimplement CALS while moving toward a more generalized product in the future.andO;More significantly, Xerox has sold and installed the first CALs system at aDoD site.andP;  Thc configuration shown at TechDoc is representative of the systemthat was installed last month at Redstone arsenal at the Army's MissionCommand (micom) center in Huntsville, Alabama.andM;&quot;CalS Enabler Set.&quot; There are sevcral aspects to the system being done formicom.andP;  Together, they will enable the army to receive CALS tapes, edit them,compose, paginate and print them and write out cALs tapes.andP;  The basicconfiguration consists of a Vax running XPS, with one or more 6085workstations running both MS-DOS and ViewPoint.andP;  Separate PCs could be usedto ran the MS-DOS components.andM;* Datalogics parser and editer.andP;  The incoming file is parsed using thcDatalogics parser, which runs in the PC.andP;  Should there be errors, they may befound and fixedusing WriterStation, thc Datalogics PC-based editor.andO;WriterStation presents a list of valid tags in a menu that is cursorsensitive-as the cursor moves, thc list of valid tags changes.andM;Datalogics has the best SGML parser/editor currently available on a PC.andP;  Itmoves thc Xerox system one step ahead of those that currently lack an SGMLeditor and keeps it in step with competitors that have chosen SoftQuad.andM;* US Lynx.andP;  The XPS uses XICS as its underlying composition language, soincoming CALS files that have been parsed and validated must be convertedinto XICS format to be composed for hard-copy output.andP;  US Lynx is providingdie conversion software, based on its new SGML conversion software.andM;As part of thc conversion, US Lynx figured out how to preserve the SGMLinformation within XICS so that outcoming files could also be converted backto SGML.andP;  It did this by embedding die SGML coding as commients in XICS.andP;  Thelimitation is that on the XPS you cannot make edits that alter the structureof the document (even adding a paragraph) without making the file invalid,because XICS has no way of generating die SGML syntax for new components.andO;(See US Lynx above for more detail)andM;* Companion 386.andP;  Xerox demonstrated the US Lynx and Datalogics productsrunning on Companion 386, its PC option for the 6085.andP;  The Companion 386attaches an 80386 processor to the 6085 processor, aHowing the user to runMS-DOS in an alternate screen on the 6085 and save files on a partition ofthe 6085 disk.andM;The 386 option is an enhancement over the previous msDOS emulation, which ranDOS in a fixed window within ViewPoint.andP;  We like die new option, which costs$3,000 (and up, depending on options), for three reasons.andP;  First, it offers a'386 processor for running DOS applications, rather than runing DOS under theMesa processor.andP;  Response times are dramatically improved.andM;Second, using an alternate screen on the same monitor, rather than a fixedwindow, gives the user a larger working space for the DOS application whilestill offering simultaneous access to ViewPoint.andP;  The Companion 386 graphicscard supports a full, two-page display for applications like VenturaPublisher.andM;Third, Xerox has enhanced the options for moving material from the MS-DOSworld to ViewPoint.andP;  One way is to bring up on the ViewPoint screen a windowthat shows the current (or last) MS-Dos display.andP;  This window can be captureddirectly as a screen dump by a ViewPoint graphics application and then pastedinto a document.andP;  The method of converting entire documents that has beenoffered for some time-copying them to the converter icon, which runs atranslation-is still available.andP;  Now, though, the user has the option ofattaching an 80-MB disk to the 80386 processor, rather than working withemulated disks on thc 6085 box.andM;The system ends up behaving somcthing like a Sun386i, and given Xerox'scommitment to porting ViewPoint to Sun, we expect current customers will bcgiven a smooth migration path when that port is completed in 1990 or 1991.andM;* IGES/CCITT converters.andP;  The converters for translating graphics into theXPS for editing were developed within ViewPoint.andP;  Since a 6085 may run bothViewPoint and XPS emulation, the uscr can run the translations and then getinto the XPS to make sure everything went through OK.andP;  The conversions may bedone manually or as a batch process.andM;* XPS.andP;  Once all conversions are complete, the XPS will format and paginatethe document for output on an Interpress printer.andP;  PostScript support was notspecified in the contract, but we cannot see why Xerox continues to drag itsheels in developing support for the page description language that is theclear market leader.andM;After output has bccn generated, the file may be translated back in the otherdirection.andP;  A CALS tape facility, which runs on the Vax, assembles the piecesof the document, inserts the proper headers and creates cALs tapes after theXICS file has been converted back into SGML, IGES and CCITT formats.andM;A first effort.andP;  Until now, we've been skeptical thatXerox would really beable to deliver a CALS system for the government that would be takenseriously by contractors.andP;  We still have reservations (not the least of whichis the inability of XICS to handle SGML, which limits editing in thecomposition system as with most of the competition), but we are encouraged bywhat we saw in this initial setup.andP;  All of the tools are present, and, thoughnot tightly integrated, all of them run from a single 6085 workstationattached to a Vax.andM;The configuration installed at micom is available now to other sites on acontract basis from Xerox CSD.andM;Technology demos.andP;  To complete the picture, Xerox also brought with it a&quot;technology demonstration&quot; (meaning no firm product commitment) for insertingSGML tags and editing SGML ASCII files on the ViewPoint editor of the 6085workstation.andM;Two scenarios were presented.andP;  The first automatically converts ViewPointstyle information into SGML coding, which involves adding generic tags to aViewPoint document.andP;  If the tagging is done manually, the menu of styles is along, unsorted list that stretches like a child's Christmas list down theentire length of thc 6085 screen.andP;  The menu is not cursor-sensitive: youscroll through the entire list to find the tag you're looking for, and thereis no indication of what tags are valid at any given point in the document.andO;However, if the document already makes use of ViewPoint styles (a featureintroduccd last year), then a translation table would convert the styles toSGML coding automatically.andM;The tags are handled by the system as attributes in the property sheet, whichmeans you can control their appearance (rum them on or off, apply stylechangcs), but otherwise they are ignored by the ViewPoint editor until thetranslation process is run.andM;This tool provides a fairly transparent means of automatically adding tags toViewPoint documents.andP;  But it does not provide any context-sensitivity orstructure enforcement.andM;The second scenario presumes that the operator is familiar with SGML.andP;  Thetagged file is converted to raw ASCII format, presumably using theautotagging feature just described.andP;  Using an SGML option within ViewPoint,the ASCII file may be edited.andM;Again, the cursor is not context-sensitive, but in SGML mode the user canopen a window that shows the tags in hierarchical fashion.andP;  Presuming thatyou know where you are in the structure, it is possible to pick a tag fromthe list of valid options at that level.andP;  Any level may be viewed, and thercis a shortcut for returning to the top level of tile document's structure.andM;When you pick a tag, the system automatically inserts the appropriate codinginto die file.andP;  This coding becomes part of the text.andP;  Thus, when editing thefile, you are editing characters; there is no way, for example, to deletebegin and end tags as a group without also deleting the content in between.andM;The ASCII file contains no formatting information, and it carrot be takenback into the ViewPoint WYSIWYG editor without losing the SGML Syntax.andP;  Thereis no SGML parser on the 6085 at this time, so parsing would take place inMS-DOS using die Datalogics parser on Companion 386 or a separate PC.andM;Once a file is parsed, it could be edited in WriterStation or edited as anASCII file in ViewPoint.andP;  Of course, editing in ViewPoint may introducefurther errors.andM;The SGML-tagging tool as shown was really a means of preparing files forhandling in &quot;CALs Enabler.&quot; It is not nearly as elegant as using an SGMLeditor with a built-in parser, but ViewPoint was developed before SGML waseven a standard.andM;Clearly, the large installed base of 6085 users in the contractor communityis interested in retrofitting documents for cALs.andP;  It is also interested insupporting SGML as new documents are created.andP;  The technology shown looks asthough it would offer this installed base a means of tagging documents fromwithin their editor.andP;  Another approach to the &quot;retrofitting&quot; problem wasintroduced by Xerox Imaging Systems (see below).andP;  At any rate, Xerox has madeno commitmentsto offering the 6085 SGML tagging facility as a commercialproduct.andP;  One of the reasons for showing it at TechDoc was to get feedbackfrom its users regarding its feasibility.andM;Xerox Imaging SystemsandM;Kurzweil and Datacopy, which together make up the Imaging Systems Division,introduced a nice package for retrofitting paper documents into SGML ASCIIfiles.andM;The Kurzweil CALS System 5100 combines the Kurzweil K-5100 intelligentcharacter reader and PC-based software with the visual recognition engine ofAvalanche Development Corp.andP;  into a complete single-user retrofittingstation.andM;Documents are scanned on the K-5100, Kurzweil's new high-end system.andP;  Forthose who remember the Kurzweil machines of a decade ago, the 5100 shows howfar technology has progressed.andP;  The scanner, developed by Fuji/Xerox, is asmall 11&quot; x 14&quot; desktop unit that scans at 400 dpi.andP;  One of its uniquefeatures is a slant-down front that makes it easy to scan bound books.andP;  A50-page sheet feeder is optional.andP;  The unit is controlled through a PCinterface.andM;Kurzweil's ICR (intelligent charactcr recognition) technology has been portedto the PC.andP;  Some of it was in the Discover product, but the 5100 includes theadvanced features such as its Verifier and assurance level specifier-a uniquefeature that lets you specify the degree of accuracy you desire.andP;  Choosing alower assurance level is faster, but it may result in some wrong guesses bythe software.andM;The Kurzweil ICR technology remains the only one on the market that handlesthe text on a page nonsequentially.andP;  The 5100 interprets the shape ofcharacters, creates words and compares them to a 50,000-word list to increaseaccuracy.andP;  (You can also add your own list of up to 10,000 words.) Whenlikely words are found, it uses the information about the letters in one wordto help determine other words.andP;  (It reminds us of solving a cryptogram :getting a word gives you some letters in other words of thc puzzle.)andM;In the CALS package, Kurzweil has integrated a special version of Avalanche'sVisual Recognition Engine into the K5100 software.andP;  This software providesthe Avlanche markup software with a text file that includes die x/y positionof all words.andP;  The Avalanche software then makes a guess about what type ofelement each one is according to a specified document layout, such asMil-Spec 38784B.andP;  It then inserts SGML tagging based on its guess.andP;  TheAvalanche software also contains an ICR compensation feature that helps itinterpret elements of the document that are common in CALS manuals and may bemisrecognized, such as warnings, cautions or different types of fists.andP;  Theresult is a product that scans paper and produces a markedUp ASCII CALS SGMLfile ready to parse.andP;  (Parser and editor are not included in the presentpackage, but Kurzweil is exploring that possibility.)andM;Our initial impression of the Kurzweil CALS system is very positive.andO;Kurzweil's ICR technology is widely respected as the best on the market.andO;Avalanche's technology has received broad acceptance among CALS vendorslooking for a retrofitting solution and is also being purchased by end users.andO;The integration of these two technologies achieved by Kurzweil is impressive.andM;Xerox is already shipping the K-5100, The basic unit, with the scanner, ICRsoftware and PC interface, costs $17,950.andP;  The Kurzweil cALS system, whichalso includes the Avalanche technology, should be ready later this month,priced at $22,950.andM;Xyvision deals with CALSandM;Xyvision introduced a CALs software package that is a standard version of thesoftware it developed with input from McDonnell Aircraft.andP;  The CALs packageis offered as an upgrade to existing Xyvision customers.andP;  It will be enhancedwith the addition of a structured editor (see Xyvision article in thisissue), but in other, respects is not affected by the Septemberannouncements.andM;CALS package.andP;  The package consists of a set of translation software forconverting SGML and CCIIT files into and out of Xyvision's native format forediting within the system; translations for reading IGES and CGM subsets intoXyvision format for display on the screen; a utility for building the tape;the 28001 DTD for validating thc text file; and training and support,including a five-day class and some on-site assistance.andP;  The basic price is$60,000.andP;  Additional training may be purchased if necessary.andM;We watched Xyvision's package in action with the CTN files and some othersthe company had prepared.andP;  Using the Sobemap parser, thc system will take anincoming file and parse it against thC DTD in either the foreground orbackground.andP;  The valid SGML file is then converted to a Xyvision filc usingXyvision's SGML translation facility.andP;  Once a file is brought into the systemand given Xyvision tags (which are matched to a style for presentation), thcfile may be edited the same as any other Xyvision document.andP;  There are nocontrols for preventing errors during the revision cycle.andM;When edits are complete, the filc is sent back out through a reversetranslation.andP;  SGMLcts notations that have bccn retained as comments arereturned, and the file is once again parsed against the DTD.andP;  A log of theparsing process may be printed, but the incarnation we saw offeredinsufficient help in identifying the location of the problem, because itidentifies problems by line numbers of the ASCII file, but the Xyvisioneditor works with composed line endings, resulting in different line counts.andO;There is no way to search on parsing errors within the Xyvision system.andM;The most obvious deficiency in the configuration shown at TechDoc is the lackof a structured editor for fixing parsing errors.andP;  Xyvision has since shoredup this gap by announcing a development agreement with SoftQuad by which itwill initially offer Author/Editor on the Macintosh later this year.andO;Sometime in 1990 It will offer a DECwindows version of Author/Editor for usewith die new Parlance system.andP;  (See the Xyvision article in this issue formore details on Parlance.)andM;Through SoftQuad, Xyvision now has an SGML editor with a built-in parser and(through SoftQuad's Rules Builder) the means to create and modify DTDS.andP;  Thislatter capability is onc reason Xyvision calls its CALS package &quot;advancedcompliance,&quot; although in reality it will bc no more advanccd than whatCompugraphic and Datalogics arc already offering.andP;  (Xyvision says what isadvanced is its training and support.)andM;Database issues.andP;  The lack of a structured editor is a problem that will becorrected very soon.andP;  (Xyvision expects to ship its structured editor by theend of the year.) A more serious limitation is the fact that because allfiles must be translated, if there are errors, the user must choose betweenupdating both the Xyvision and the SGML file (making two sets of changes) orrunning the file in and out of the translation process every time you need tofix an error.andP;  Although the batch translation is quicker than most, it isstill slow enough to make you wish you didn't have to do it all.andP;  As usersbecome comfortable in preparing SGML files on editorial systems, the chancesof producing a clean file for the Xyvision production system rise.andP;  But thequestion remains: do you keep your files in an SGML database and use Xyvisionstrictly as a formatter, or do you keep documents in pages on a Xyvisionsystem and generate SGML when you need it?andM;In the near term, current customers may find the latter more palatable-itreduces the amount of investment in capital equipment and personnelresources.andP;  But in so doing they may find that the XYvision CALS packageclearly illustrates the retrofitting headache that CALS will be for manycontractors that already have an installed base of noncompliant systems.andO;This problem will be shared by users of Interleaf Context and othercomposition systems that make use of generic tagging but do not presentlywork with files in SGML syntax.andM;One of the announcements Xyvision made a month later was a VAR relationshipwith Oracle to use its relational database manager.andP;  Xyvision hasn't fullyformulated itS SGML database strategy yet, but it indicated that it mayexplore the possibility of using Oracle to link SGML information with aXyvision database in the future.andM;Yard's companion to SobemapandM;Yard Software Systems, a British subsidiary of the $400 million Europeansystems house Sema Group, announced a PCbased structurcd document editor toaccompany the parser developed by another Sema subsidiary, Sobemap.andM;Unfortunately, we wcre unable to take a look at Yard's structured editor atTechDoc.andP;  From its specifications, it looks like an editor that might beuseful to both OEMS and end users.andP;  As an OEM product, it could be interfacedto a composition system, similar to the way Datalogics has integratedWriterStation with Pager.andP;  End users would purchase Yard as a PC alternativeto SoftQuad's Author/Editor.andP;  We hope to examine Yard's product soon tocompare it with the competition.andM;Yard's structured editor runs on IBM-compatible PCs with DOS 3.0 or higherand at least 640 KB of RAM.andP;  Available directly from Yard, it costs $475.andM;Yard Software Systems, Avonbridge, Bath Rd., Chippenham SN14 2BB, England;{44}249 656194.andM;Yard USA, Suite 801, 5845 Richmond Hwy., Alexandria, VA 22302; (703)329-3380.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
