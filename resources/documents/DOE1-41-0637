This technique, called the falling head test (FHT), allowscalculations of kh and skin by use of type curves developed for drillstemtests (DST's). Results from the FHT compare favorably with values obtainedfrom conventional buildup tests. The tests cited in this paper were conductedin heavy-oil reservoirs.</TEXT></DOC>
