Under theDL procedure, foreign consignees are authorized to ship between themselvesand their customers without requesting permission from the DL holder. Arequirement that DL holders notify all their consignees on the licensewhen the Office of Export Licensing has prohibited the sale or transferof commodities to specified firms or individuals currently appears in theExport Administration Regulations (15 CFR 773.3(f)(3)(v)). This rule amendsandSection; 773.3(1)(4)(ii) to clarify the notification procedures to befollowed by the DL holder when consignees are deleted, suspended or revokedfrom a Distribution License. Clarification of these procedures will ensurethat currently approved consignees do not continue to reexport commoditiesto newly deleted consignees under a Distribution License.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>October 21, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Michael Hoffman, Office of ExportLicensing, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, Telephone:(202) 377-3287.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements</ITAG>1. Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared.2. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does notrequire that this rule be published in proposed form because this ruledoes not impose a new control. Further, no other law requires that noticeof proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given forthis rule.3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.4. This rule contains a collection of information subject to the requirementsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This collection has been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget under control number 0694-0015. Public reporting burden fornotifying all foreign consignees whenever a foreign consignee is suspended,removed or revoked from a Distribution License is estimated to average20 minutes per response.
