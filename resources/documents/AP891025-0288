IBM spokesman Paul Bergevin said the Advanced SemiconductorTechnology Center in East Fishkill, N.Y., was ``the nation's mostadvanced semiconductor development laboratory and on a par with anyanywhere in the world.''   The upstate New York laboratory will eventually house thenation's first privately owned machine for etching computer chipswith X-rays, IBM said.   IBM scientists are already experimenting with X-ray etching atBrookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y. Motorola will pay anundisclosed amount of money to send its engineers to Brookhaven toparticipate in the IBM research for 21 months.   The X-ray work at Brookhaven will be transferred to the newlaboratory in East Fishkill in 1991, at which time the investmentin the laboratory will total about $500 million, Bergevin said.   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher attended Wednesday'sdedication ceremonies, along with Robert Noyce of Sematech andSanford Kane of U.S. Memories Inc. The two organizations areintended to bolster America's standing in computer chips.   Bergevin said IBM was discussing sharing its X-ray etchingresearch with other U.S. companies out of an interest instrengthening the overall U.S. semiconductor industry.   Scientists say future generations of computer chips will be sodensely packed with circuitry that regular light will be too fuzzyto etch the circuit lines. X-rays have shorter wavelengths, so theycan draw finer lines.   Japanese companies are working intensively in X-ray etching.Bergevin said ``we're certainly on a par with the very bestefforts'' of the Japanese.   The East Fishkill laboratory will consolidate semiconductorresearch now done at chipmaking plants in East Fishkill and EssexJunction, Vt., and at IBM research headquarters in YorktownHeights, N.Y.</TEXT></DOC>
