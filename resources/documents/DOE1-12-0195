<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-12-0195 </DOCNO><TEXT>One considers the asymptotic behavior of the spectrum of the Dirichletproblem for a class of operators with constant coefficients, includingin it the hypoelliptic operators. For this class one obtains the classicalWeyl formula of spectral asymptotics. The residual of the distributionfunction of the spectrum is estimated in terms of the measure of theinterior boundary layer of the level surface of the operator symbol.These results can be carried over also to the vectorial case. One considersseparately the class of operators whose quadratic form corresponds tothe differential norm of the Sobolev type. For the indicated class onedescribes all possible elementary generalizations of the Weyl formula.</TEXT></DOC>
