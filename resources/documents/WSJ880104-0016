Stevens (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> JAPAN EUROP </CO><IN> MON FRX </IN><TEXT>   Last year was bad enough for the dollar. Struggling under towering deficits in U.S. trade and the federal budget, it fell 24% against the Japanese yen and 18% against the West German mark.    But in 1988, the U.S. currency will carry last year's burdens and a new one as well: the political uncertainty of a presidential election year. It's no wonder, then, that many economists and foreign exchange traders see the dollar extending its nearly three-year-old decline deep into 1988 and perhaps beyond. The dollar finished 1987 just above 121 yen and 1.57 marks, the historic lows that it touched Thursday, during the year's final trading session.    Moreover, higher interest rates, a favorite tool of policy-makers for propping up a sagging currency, are almost unthinkable as long as Washington's top priority is avoiding a recession in the wake of the stock market crash.    &quot; 'Eighty-eight will be as tough a year as '87 was for the dollar. As far as I can see, it's all negative,&quot; said Jim O'Neill, financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank, New York.    If the stubborn U.S. trade deficit starts moving lower, however, some economists see a chance for the dollar to bottom and recover a bit this year. With the dollar's value against the yen and mark down 54% and 55%, respectively, from its 1985 highs, a significant improvement in the trade gap could produce an upward bounce in the dollar, they say.    A weaker dollar tends to discourage imports by making them more expensive for Americans and encourages exports by making U.S. goods less expensive abroad.    &quot;If we make sustained progress in narrowing the trade deficit, then that would certainly be good for the dollar,&quot; Marc M. Goloven, vice president and international economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said. He is &quot;personally optimistic that there will be progress&quot; on that front.    The U.S. trade deficit gets more of the blame than any other single factor for the dollar's decline that began in February 1985. The trade deficit also was the main reason for the September 1985 effort by the Group of Five nations --the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and Britain --to weaken the dollar through central bank sales of the currency in foreign exchange markets and officials' remarks designed to encourage traders to sell dollars.    But 1987 saw governments use these same tactics to brake the dollar's fall, as officials sought to stabilize exchange rates. Although the dollar still fell significantly during the year, the Group of Five --joined by Italy and Canada to make it the Group of Seven --is generally credited with managing the most stable period of dollar exchange rates in the past five years.    The biggest event for the dollar last year was the Feb. 22 announcement in Paris of an agreement by six of the Group of Seven nations to stabilize exchange rates &quot;around current levels.&quot; (The dollar then was at 153.80 yen and 1.8310 marks.) It later was disclosed that the Louvre accord, as the agreement became known, also set unpublicized trading ranges for the dollar.    For the next eight months, the dollar traded within relatively narrow ranges of 1.75 to 1.90 marks and 135 to 155 yen. Every major sell-off of the U.S. currency was challenged by extensive and coordinated central bank dollar-buying. By year end, the major central banks of the world had spent an estimated $100 billion on foreign exchange market intervention, mostly in defense of the dollar but occasionally to resist sharp run-ups in its value.    After the Oct. 19 stock market crash, the dollar finally plunged through the floor of the ranges that it had respected for most of the year. In the wake of the crash, Treasury Secretary James Baker said U.S. policy would be to keep downward pressure on interest rates to avoid a recession, at the risk of seeing the dollar fall some more. Lower interest rates tend to make dollar-denominated investments less attractive and decrease demand for dollars.    After the Baker announcement, currency traders began speculating that, for the time being anyway, the Louvre accord had been shelved.    The dollar's final shove downward for 1987 was supplied by last month's report of a record $17.6 billion U.S. trade deficit for October. On that news, the dollar plummeted to its lowest levels since 1949 against the yen and the mark.    The most bearish --but not uncommon --forecasts for the dollar for 1988 call for it to plunge to 100 yen and 1.40 marks.    In addition to a continuation of last year's trade and budget woes, economists are adding this year's presidential election to the negative factors affecting the currency.    &quot;Political uncertainty is unlikely to be a positive factor for the dollar,&quot; David Morrison, vice president and chief international economist at Goldman Sachs International Corp., London, wrote in his most recent forecast.    To help Republican candidates for president and Congress, the Reagan administration is expected to keep interest rates down to spur the economy. That would tend to weaken support for the dollar. Moreover, an expected economic slowdown this year could increase the chances of a Democrat winning the presidency, which some economists say also would undercut the dollar.    &quot;People perceive that the Democrats are bad for the budget and bad for inflation,&quot; Mr. O'Neill of Marine Midland said. &quot;And the Democrats will be pushing for a (protectionist) trade bill. That's all negative for the dollar.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
