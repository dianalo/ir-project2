But the shareholders don't have the last word on the union.    The Federal Communications Commission does, and there are lingering concerns about the merger among competitors, customers and in Congress that the agency must consider. &quot;The commerce committee's interest is seeing that the satellite communications statute is complied with,&quot; said a spokeswoman for Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.).    The spokeswoman suggested that if the commission decides that the merger isn't consistent with the law but lets it go through, the tough-talking chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the FCC, might act to oppose it.    Atlanta-based Contel is a holding company for local telephone companies in 30 states and the Caribbean. It also has several nonregulated communications and information-processing businesses, including satellite and telephone equipment.    Comsat, which provides transatlantic communications for international and maritime customers, is designated by Congress to represent the U.S. on Intelsat, a consortium of 110 countries that provides a world-wide telecommunications network and in which Comsat also holds a 25% stake. Federal regulations require that one of every two overseas calls from the U.S. be transmitted via Intelsat.    &quot;The fundamental appeal of the merger is reduced costs, and opportunities for the combined company to do new business overseas in the satellite arena,&quot; said John N. Lemasters, the designated president and chief executive of the combined entity, which would retain the name Comsat.    But in the wake of the proposal last year, competitors such as MCI Communications Corp. claimed a Contel-Comsat combination would pose unfair competition. The long-distance carrier has complained to the FCC that both companies provide monopoly telecommunications services in their markets, and thus would have the means and incentive to be anticompetitive.    Rep. Edward J. Markey (D., Mass.), the recently appointed chairman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, has expressed concerns that Comsat's revenue could be used to cross-subsidize Contel's nonregulated operations. And in a letter to the chairman of the FCC last October, Rep. Dingell raised several concerns including whether the proposed merger would transfer ownership of Comsat to Contel shareholders, managers or both and whether such a transfer would violate the terms of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962.    In addition, the three major television networks, important Comsat customers, jointly asked the FCC to erect safeguards to prevent cross-subsidies that would ultimately be borne by Comsat's customers.    In an interview, Mr. Lemasters said that Rep. Dingell's letter appears to indicate that a broad review of the Communications Satellite Act is in order. &quot;We have looked at (the law) in sufficient detail, and we think by and large the act is still appropriate,&quot; he said.    Regarding the specter of anti-competitive actions, Mr. Lemasters said that the combined company would have annual sales of about $3.5 billion, &quot;but we still couldn't be considered a dominant player in a consolidating industry.&quot; The larger size simply would &quot;give us sufficient muscle to play in the game of the future,&quot; Mr. Lemasters added.    The executive said the company could achieve savings of about $20 million annually on general and administrative costs, reflecting, in part, staff cutbacks. &quot;We do expect some fallout,&quot; he said.    Mr. Lemasters, who is currently president and chief executive of Contel, said the two companies have shed some businesses that didn't fit their strategies, but added that the combined company would review the question of additional divestitures.    He emphasized that Comsat is most interested in internal growth rather than major acquisitions. &quot;We aren't at this point looking for new areas of activity,&quot; he said. &quot;The market represented by the two companies' thrusts (is) sufficient to meet our growth requirements for the next several years,&quot; Mr. Lemasters said, declining to be specific about Comsat's growth target. </TEXT></DOC>
