Mr. Shultz said he learned about the discussions only last weekend.    Mr. Shultz also called the transfer of funds from U.S. arms sales to Iran to support the U.S.-backed Contras in Nicaragua &quot;illegal.&quot; The Associated Press reported, however, that he backed away from the assertion in a news conference while flying to London to meet European foreign ministers, saying he didn't know enough about what happened to make such a claim.    In his testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Shultz said he knew nothing about the diversion of funds to the Contras. &quot;My role in that was zero,&quot; he asserted.    Later, Robert McFarlane, the former national security adviser, confirmed reports that President Reagan in August 1985 orally authorized arms shipments to Iran from a third country, which officials have identified as Israel. He said Mr. Reagan's great concern for American hostages in Lebanon was &quot;a very leading underpinning of this whole initiative.&quot;    Mr. McFarlane told the lawmakers he learned about the diversion of funds to the Contras in May 1986, while on a secret negotiating mission to Tehran after he left the government. He said he didn't know who authorized the diversion and that he didn't tell the president about the diversion.    The hearing came as a special appeals court authorized Attorney General Edwin Meese to release documents supporting his request for an independent counsel to investigate the Iran-Contras affair. In the four-page filing, Mr. Meese didn't name any senior Reagan administration officials or identify specific laws that may have been broken, however.    Both Mr. Shultz and Mr. McFarlane left unresolved the question about who in the administration was setting the policy.    &quot;I'm not the witness to testify,&quot; Mr. Shultz said. &quot;I'm not informed.&quot; And Mr. McFarlane suggested that President Reagan's strong rhetorical support for &quot;freedom fighters&quot; may have contributed to a &quot;presumption of authority&quot; to carry out the mission to aid the Contras even if specific authorization didn't exist.    Yesterday was the first time either man testified in public -- and under oath -- about the burgeoning scandal. It was an awkward two hours for the secretary of state. He defended President Reagan's decision to try to improve relations with Iran. But stating repeatedly that he knew little about the details of the arms-sale operation, he sharply criticized the trading of weapons for hostages.    He also said it was &quot;very questionable&quot; to let the National Security Council staff play an active role in carrying out policies. And he conceded that the White House probably should have informed Congress sooner about the Iran arms shipments.    He told lawmakers that his knowledge of the Iran arms transfers was &quot;sporadic and fragmentary and materially incomplete.&quot; He added that his knowledge was &quot;nonexistent&quot; about the plan developed by Lt. Col. Oliver North, who was fired from the NSC staff last month, to funnel profits through a Swiss bank account to the Contras.    Mr. Shultz, clearly irritated, disclosed that he just learned, as a result of an &quot;all-posts directive&quot; sent by the department, that John Kelly, U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, had &quot;numerous discussions&quot; in October and November with Lt. Col. North and Richard Secord, a retired Air Force general reportedly involved in the arms shipments.    That was the first time a senior administration official publicly linked Mr. Secord with the Iran-Contras affair. The discussions involved efforts to win the release of U.S. hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.    Mr. Shultz also said that, without his knowledge, Ambassador Kelly was briefed last July and August by Mr. McFarlane, and communicated secretly with the Central Intelligence Agency and Vice Admiral John Poindexter, Mr. McFarlane's successor, who resigned last month.    Mr. Shultz said he was, &quot;to put it mildly, shocked to learn this after the event from an ambassador.&quot; He said, &quot;There's supposed to be a chain of command&quot; under which ambassadors report to the State Department.    Mr. Shultz also told the committee that he thought it was &quot;outrageous&quot; that Lt. Col. North arranged for H. Ross Perot, a wealthy industrialist, to provide a $2 million ransom for the U.S. hostages in Lebanon. That transaction never took place. Mr. Shultz said, &quot;I was not informed. So far as I know, the president wasn't informed.&quot;    The attorney general's request for a special counsel lays out a broad, relatively unfettered mandate for an independent investigation of President Reagan's worst foreign policy crisis. But it contains substantially fewer details about potential criminal violations than were included in preliminary drafts, according to administration officials.    Lt. Col. North is the only individual named in the document. Some administration officials had speculated that Mr. Poindexter also would be mentioned.    In the past, filings seeking appointment of an independent counsel typically have singled out certain high-ranking government officials for investigation of possible wrongdoing, and they have indicated particular laws that may have been broken.    By contrast, the latest filing requests appointment of an independent counsel with general authority to &quot;investigate and prosecute any and all&quot; criminal violations stemming from arms sales to Iran or diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels.    Mr. Meese told the court that such a prosecutor should be authorized to investigate all U.S. government officials, private citizens or foreigners who may have been &quot;acting in concert&quot; with Lt. Col. North in potentially illegal activities. Lt. Col. North and Mr. Poindexter have declined to comment on the matter.    A panel of three semi-retired judges, which has the final say over who will head the investigation and what its scope will be, is almost certain to go along with Mr. Meese's recommendations. A final decision is expected by next week.    Some Democratic lawmakers, however, immediately criticized Mr. Meese's request as too narrow and urged the judges to expand the investigation's scope to include potential violations involving other efforts by administration officials to help the Contras.    Among other things, the lawmakers want an independent investigation of administration efforts to solicit donations from individuals and foreign governments to the Contras, along with possible use of U.S. funds or personnel to support secret airstrips in Central America.    The Justice Department said that the independent counsel's charter could be broadened if new evidence warrants it. &quot;If they find something unexpected, they're not precluded from pursuing it,&quot; asserted Associate Attorney General Stephen Trott.    Mr. Meese told the court that a thorough investigation &quot;in all likelihood&quot; will require consideration of whether to grant immunity to certain witnesses, a tactic commonly used in criminal investigations. The filing didn't provide any details. Once the attorney general begins the process leading toward appointment of an independent prosecutor, the Justice Department itself is barred from granting immunity.    Meanwhile, Sen. David Durenberger (R., Minn.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the panel has subpoenaed documents concerning the Iran-Contras affair from the National Security Council and the State Department. The committee, beginning its second week of closed hearings on the issue, heard testimony from Elliott Abrams, the State Department's administrator for Latin American affairs. </TEXT></DOC>
