That's the lesson anti-nuclear activists learned Tuesday in Maine, where a state referendum aimed at shutting down the state's only nuclear reactor was soundly defeated by a 59%-to-41% margin.    The vote was a blow to the anti-nuclear movement, which entered the referendum campaign thinking that it had a good chance to win a vote to close the plant after two unsuccessful attempts in the past. Activists hoped that concern over a possible nuclear waste burial site in Maine and over nuclear-power safety in light of the Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union might win votes for their position.    Polls earlier this year showed Maine voters evenly split on the issue. But in the end, voters favored keeping the Maine Yankee plant open by an even wider margin than they did in the last attempt to close the plant in 1982, when the vote was 55% to 45% in favor of keeping the plant. Maine Yankee, located in Wiscasset, is owned by 11 New England utilities.    Pro-nuclear forces won in part by contending throughout the campaign that closing Maine Yankee, which among nuclear facilities produced the cheapest electricity in the country, would substantially increase electricity rates. &quot;Whenever a nuclear issue comes up, people assess the risks and look at the dollar figures and then decide in the corner of economics,&quot; said Paul Mandabach, a political consultant on nuclear power who has helped defeat several referendums to close plants, including facilities in California and Oregon.    In addition, the pro-nuclear forces far outspent the opposition, pouring some $5 million into the campaign, compared with only about $600,000 by the anti-nuclear groups. &quot;We will never be able to match them dollar for dollar,&quot; said Joseph Kriesberg, energy policy analyst for Public Citizen, a national monitor of anti-nuclear efforts.    To many, Maine's was a test case.    &quot;This was the heavyweight champion fight of the nuclear industry,&quot; said Joseph Kelliher, legislative program director of the American Nuclear Energy Council, a trade association and lobbyist group. &quot;Both sides had the strongest punches coming into this fight, and we felt that if we could withstand this bout we probably could (withstand) bouts in the future,&quot; Mr. Kelliher said.    Nevertheless, anti-nuclear forces aren't discouraged.    &quot;We'll be stung for a week,&quot; said Mr. Kriesberg, whose office is about to release a report on political tactics for seeking plant closures. &quot;But we'll regroup. We're not going to go away as long as the specter of a nuclear disaster lingers.&quot;    Maine's referendum marked the fifth time since 1976 that activists have unsuccessfully mounted drives to shut down nuclear power plants in the country. It was also the third try to close the 15-year-old plant in central Maine.    Efforts are still under way in Massachusetts and California to keep nuclear plants that are shut for repairs from reopening, anti-nuclear activists said.    But, maintains Mr. Mandabach, Americans aren't opposed to nuclear power as a source of energy. &quot;If there was any doubt, the example of Maine should say something.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
