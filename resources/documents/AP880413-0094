Nixon said today.   South Africa has failed a ``moral litmus test'' on its policiestoward blacks, Nixon said.   ``South Africa presents a problem where everybody agrees we areagainst apartheid,'' he said. ``The question is what can we doabout it?''   He said sanctions and pulling out investments should be given achance to work, but if they don't ``we may have to go completely inthe other direction.   ``I do know that American corporations are one of the mostprogressive forces for change and I think it's really better tohave them into South Africa, adopting policies, providing equalopportunities and going far beyond that than their getting out andhaving South African racists running'' the country.   Nixon made his remarks on NBC-TV's ``Today'' program in the lastof three interviews in connection with his seventh and latest book,``1999.''</TEXT></DOC>
