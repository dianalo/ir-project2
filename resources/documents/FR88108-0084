No. 15-15126) located in Knox County,Kentucky. The petition is filed under section 101(c) of the Federal MineSafety and Health Act of 1977.A summary of the petitioner's statements follows:1. The petition concerns the requirement that a methane monitor be installedon any electric face cutting equipment, continuous monitor, longwall faceequipment and loading machine and shall be kept operative and properlymaintained and frequently tested.2. Petitioner states that no methane has been detected in the mine. Thethree wheel tractors are permissible DC powered machines, with no hydraulics.The bucket is a drag type, where approximately 30-40% of the coal is handloaded. Approximately 20% of the time that the tractor is in use, it isused as a man trip and supply vehicle.3. As an alternate method, petitioner proposes to use hand held continuousoxygen and methane monitors in lieu of methane monitors on three wheeltractors. In further support of this request, petitioner states that:(a) Each three wheel tractor will be equipped with a hand held continuousmonitoring methane and oxygen detector and all persons will be trainedin the use of the detector;(b) A gas test will be performed, prior to allowing the coal loading tractorsin the face area, to determine the methane concentration in the atmosphere.The air quality will be monitored continuously after each trip, providedthe elapse time between trips does not exceed 20 minutes. This will providecontinuous monitoring of the mine atmosphere for methane to assure anyundetected methane buildup between trips;(c) If one percent of methane is detected, the operator will manually deenergizethe battery tractor immediately. Production will cease and will not resumeuntil the methane level is lower than one percent;(d) A spare continuous monitor will be available to assure that all coalhauling tractors will be equipped with a continuous monitor;(e) Each monitor will be removed from the mine at the end of the shift,and will be inspected and charged by a qualified person. The monitor willalso be calibrated monthly; and(f) No alterations or modifications will be made in addition to the manufacturer'sspecifications.4. Petitioner states that the proposed alternate method will provide thesame degree of safety for the miners affected as that afforded by the standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments</ITAG>Persons interested in this petition may furnish written comments.
