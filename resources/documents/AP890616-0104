The ceremony for Nagy and four colleagues in Heroes' Squareamounted to a catharsis for Hungary and mirrored remarkably swiftpolitical changes.   For example, the ruling Communist Party, which is following theSoviet Union's lead in adopting political reforms, began talks thisweek with opposition leaders on holding multiparty elections.   After the ceremony in the square, a motorcade took the coffins toRakoskert Cemetery in suburban Budapest, where Nagy and the otherswere dumped in unmarked graves after their executions in 1958. Thefive were reburied today in marked graves on the same spot, knownsimply as Plot 301.   ``We see this day as a dividing line, which we hope will mean wecan begin to build a new and free Hungary,'' said Andras Kaplar, amember of the opposition Hungarian Democratic Forum.   In Washington, the State Department praised the reburial. ``Wesee the rehabilitation'' of Nagy ``as part of a larger process, thatof Hungary coming to grips with the truth of its past,'' saidspokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. ``This was an important day inHungary and one that was necessary as the country moves furtheralong the path of freedom toward democracy.''   Mourners filled the square and filed past the coffins, where 650wreaths from across Hungary were piled up. Many people came totoday's ceremony bearing flowers and wearing lapel pins withportraits of Nagy or the national colors.   A sixth, empty coffin lay beside the five others. It symbolizedall those who were killed by Soviet tanks and troops that crushedthe revolt and by later reprisals. The names and biographies of 250young Hungarians executed after the revolt were solemnly read.   The mourners, estimated by Hungarian television at 250,000people, included many of Hungary's leading intellectuals, hundredsof former prisoners in Stalinist camps, and onetime leaders of thefailed revolt for a free Hungary.   ``This day marks the change of an era,'' said Imre Mecs, who wassentenced to death after the uprising, in a speech for delivery atthe ceremony.   ``We are burying a regime that was bad from the start, which wasrejected by the nation, which was forced upon us, and which hasproven bankrupt in every regard,'' Mecs said. He was released fromjail in 1963 after his death sentence was commuted.   A delegation of the communist-led government headed by PremierMiklos Nemeth was among those paying their respects.   Italian Socialist leader Bettino Craxi, U.S. Ambassador MarkPalmer and diplomats from the Soviet Union and almost all othernations with embassies in Budapest attended the ceremony.   Hungarian television began all-day broadcasting of the elaborateceremonies. Black flags hung from many buildings in the capital.   Hungary's neighbors also recalled the events of 1956.   Austrian television planned a live broadcast of much of theceremony.   The Charter 77 human rights group in Czechoslovakia sent amessage honoring Nagy as ``a symbol of the struggle for freedom,democracy and embodiment of universal values, which also guide us inour struggle for social rebirth.''   However, Romania, Albania and North Korea declined to senddiplomats to the reburial. China, in the throes of its owncrackdown, also did not send a representative.   In the weeks preceding the reburial, the government and theCommunist Party gave startling reassessments of Nagy, who wasexecuted in 1958 on trumped-up charges of high treason.   Reburied along with Nagy were his defense minister, Pal Maleter;his minister of state, Geza Losonczy; the head of his secretariat,Jozsef Szilagyi, and journalist and close Nagy associate MiklosGimes.   In a de facto rehabilitation, the government hailed Nagy as an``outstanding statesman'' this week and the party said he had becomea symbol of communist reform policies.   Hundreds of exiled survivors of 1956 returned to Budapest for thefuneral, many for the first time.   Bela Kiraly, who was No. 2 in the military in Nagy's short-livedgovernment, said: ``The Stalinists forced Bolshevik ideas and theSoviet system upon the Hungarians. They forged shackles out ofideology and put the Hungarian nation into irons.''   Now living in the United States, he returned home for the firsttime in 33 years to attend the funeral.   Speaking for the independent Hungarian youth organization FIDESZ,Viktor Orban drew applause when he call for the Soviets to withdrawtheir troops from Hungary. ``If we muster enough courage, then wecan put an end to communist dictatorship,'' he added.   This week the party began talks with opposition leaders onmultiparty elections, a goal of the 1956 revolt.   Until last February, when the party leadership conceded that apopular uprising began the revolt of 1956, the party had called theevents a counterrevolution.   The revolt grew out of popular revulsion toward the Stalinistregime of Matyas Rakosi. It began on Oct. 23, 1956, with massdemonstrations for a new government and more democracy, which led toNagy's rise to power.   Soviet tanks and troops moved into Budapest on Nov. 4, 1956, toend the uprising.</TEXT></DOC>
