However, additional insight into the natureof exposure-response relationships is provided by animal experimentationand dosimetric determinations. Animal studies have now been conductedfor more than 50 years to examine the levels of pollutants in undergroundmines that were responsible for the respiratory effects observed amongminers. This work has emphasized respiratory cancer and the interactionof radon with other agents, such as ore dust, diesel-engine-exhaust fumesand cigarette smoke. The more recent data on radon-daughter inhalationexposures were provided by two American research centers, The Universityof Rochester (UR) and the Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL), and bythe Compagnie Generale des Matieres Nucleaires (COGEMA) laboratory inFrance. Approximately 2000 mice, 100 rats and 80 dogs were employed inthe completed UR studies, begun in the mid 1950s; 800 hamsters, 5000rats and 100 dogs in the ongoing PNL studies, begun in the late 1960s;and 10,000 rats in the ongoing COGEMA studies, also begun in the late1960s. More complete updated biological effects, data resulting fromchronic radon-daughter inhalation exposures of mice, hamsters, rats andbeagle dogs were examined. Emphasis on the carcinogenic effects of radon-decayproduct exposure, including the influences of radon-daughter exposurerate, unattached fraction and disequilibrium, and co-exposures to otherpollutants. Plausible values for the radon (radon-daughter) lifetimelung-cancer risk coefficients are also provided. 13 refs., 1 fig., 1tab.</TEXT></DOC>
