District Judge Stanley Harris said Mr. Bilzerian'scriminal conviction in 1989 covered most of the civilsecurities-fraud charges brought by the SEC and that theagency didn't need to prove its case again. Judge Harrisordered a hearing to determine the profits Mr. Bilzeriangained from his illegal activities and to set an amount forrepayment to investors.</LP><TEXT>   In 1989, Mr. Bilzerian was sentenced to a four-year prisonterm for his conviction on nine felony counts relating to histakeover activities, including securities fraud, tax fraudand filing false documents with the SEC. After severalunsuccessful appeals of that decision and sentencing, he isleft only with the option of an appeal to the Supreme Court.An attorney for Mr. Bilzerian said he will seek that appealnext month.   The SEC, in civil charges against Mr. Bilzerian that year,told the court that the former raider had reaped profits of$31.3 million in takeover plays for Cluett Peabody andamp; Co.,Hammermill Paper Co., H.H. Robertson Co. and Armco Inc. Itwas determined during the criminal proceedings that Mr.Bilzerian had a net worth of $81.4 million.   An attorney for Mr. Bilzerian, Joseph Brenner, a partnerat Wilmer, Cutler andamp; Pickering, said, &quot;Mr. Bilzerian intendsto appeal the judge's order at the appropriate time.&quot;   The SEC doesn't need to stay with the $31.3 millionfigure, and agency lawyers expect a battle to determine justhow much Mr. Bilzerian gained from his deals. That scrap willbe based on legal theories of how to value profits allegedlygained from concealing the true ownership of stock, stockmanipulation and filing false and late SEC disclosurestatements.   Barry Goldsmith, who tried the case for the SEC, said thatin earlier hearings, lawyers for Mr. Bilzerian argued thatthe agency's $31.3 million figure was &quot;wildly inflated.&quot; TheSEC hasn't yet filed a formal request with the judge, but Mr.Brenner said, &quot;If the SEC does seek any kind of disgorgementor other relief, {Mr. Bilzerian} does intend to contest itvigorously.&quot;   Other battles between lawyers for the SEC and Mr.Bilzerian have been hardfought, too. When the agency beganlooking for Mr. Bilzerian to try to serve him with the civilcomplaint, agency officials couldn't find him at his Tampa,Fla., home. They soon discovered that he was vacationing inrural Minnesota, well-protected by security. The Minnesotaprocess server was unable to penetrate the security, butfinally tracked down Mr. Bilzerian boarding the Singerprivate plane at a Minnesota airport.   The Bilzerian case also involved several other majordefendants. Edward DeBartolo Sr. settled the SEC chargeswithout admitting or denying wrongdoing when the case wasbrought in 1989, disgorging $2.8 million of profit from theCluett and Hammermill deals.   William Moses, who was accused of insider trading in theHammermill deal and aiding in false disclosure in the Cluettdeal, agreed to disgorge $200,000 in allegedly illicitprofits and pay a penalty of $129,375. He also didn't admitor deny wrongdoing.   The agency said its related case remains pending againstDavid A. Tallant, a Sacramento, Calif., attorney.</TEXT></DOC>
