Every day, every play, Wright is all overHanks the way he used to shadow receivers.;   Hanks doesn't take the criticismpersonally. He grew up admiring Wright, nine years his senior, and takes hiscoaching to heart.;   &quot;It's invaluable,&quot; Hanks said. &quot;He always has somethingto say about technique. Information coming from the guy who was probably thebest cover corner in his day is just invaluable information.&quot;;   Wright, whoretired after last season, had his own demanding coach during his rookieseason, 11 years ago, in the person of George Seifert.;   &quot;I've got to get onMert,&quot; Wright said. &quot;He's going to be good.&quot;;   That's what the 49ers arehoping for and why they're investing a lot of effort in Hanks. Hanks won'tstart this week in the base defense, but may soon challenge Mark Lee for thestarting left cornerback job.;   &quot;We think he's going to make a fine defensiveback,&quot; defensive coordinator Bill McPherson said. &quot;He's got some flash tohim.&quot;;   The 49ers considered Hanks -- a wiry, ex-Los Angeles Laker MichaelCooper look-alike -- a steal when they drafted him last spring in thefifth-round, out of Iowa.;   &quot;When we first saw Merton, the first thing thatstood out was (his big-play ability),&quot; Seifert said. &quot;The very good defensivebacks are fellows that can run full speed down the field and -- at thecritical moment, when a ball's coming in -- they can manipulate the upper partof their body and make plays.&quot;;   Hanks made several plays last week. He ledthe team in tackles with seven, six solo. He &quot;defensed&quot; a pass. And in thesecond quarter, he stripped the ball from Detroit receiver Jeff Campbell andrecovered the fumble.;   But he also let receiver Brett Perriman get past himon a couple of plays. And that's what sticks out in his mind.;   &quot;We'resupposed to make big plays,&quot; Hanks said. &quot;That's why we're here. . . . But Ihad too many coverage mistakes.&quot;;   Wright let him know. When he's in thegame, Hanks is constantly checking back to the sideline for Wright.;   &quot;I tryto listen to everything he has to say and get it into my game,&quot; Hanks said.&quot;I'm striving to be the type of player he was. He was a great technician,always in good position and always competing for the ball.&quot;;   Seifertbelieves Wright has authority with young players such as Hanks because of hisplaying career.;   Hanks looks at the positive side of the constant barrage ofadvice and criticism.;   &quot;If he didn't say anything,&quot; Hanks said. &quot;I wouldn'tthink he cared.&quot;;   Wright obviously cares a lot.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ANN KILLION, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911025  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  501  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, October 25, 199100299217,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
