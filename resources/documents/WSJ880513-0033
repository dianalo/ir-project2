The holder, Ivan Milit of New York, also charged abusive control in those talks. First Capital, a Los Angeles-based financial services holding company, was named as a nominal defendant in the suit, which purports to be a class action and seeks unspecified damages, along with an order enjoining defendants from receiving proceeds of the transaction being discussed.    Among the individuals sued are Robert I. Weingarten and his wife, Palomba. Mr. Weingarten, chairman and president of First Capital, and his wife are discussing a transaction to sell Shearson their 17% of First Capital at a premium over current market prices. The stake Shearson, a 60%-owned unit of American Express Co., hopes to buy hasn't been disclosed.    None of the defendants could be reached last evening for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
