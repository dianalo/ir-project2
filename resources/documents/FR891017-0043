Turbine sectionrotors are further subjected to high temperature by hot gases from theengine combustion process which, in turn, produces a more severe stresscondition and an erosive environment. Engine designers have been able tosolve these problems in an acceptable manner throughout the normal operatingrange of the engine. However, rotor burst failures continue to occur, oftendue to external events or other factors such as lubrication failures, exposureto transient overtemperature conditions, bearing failures, turbine loadabsorbing mechanism failures, and structural failures.A typical burst failure involves mechanical rupture of the rotor whichresults in a high velocity, high energy radial dispersal of rotor fragmentsor adjacent engine components. Impact from these fragments can inflictdamage to critical rotorcraft structure, systems, controls, main and tailrotors, rotor drive system elements, and other engines; in addition thesefragments can injure occupants.The need for increasing the level of safety is further supported by theadverse accident history that continues for rotor burst failures. Specificairworthiness directives are currently required to correct rotor burstproblems uncovered by the adverse accident history. It should be notedthat parts 23 and 25 already require engine rotor burst protection forairplanes which are by geometry more protected from engine rotor burstthan rotorcraft. This proposal would explicitly state and increase theminimum level of safety for engine rotor burst protection and require thatall necessary engine rotor burst design precautions be incorporated duringcertification.<ITAG tagnum="84">History</ITAG>The FAA held its Rotorcraft Regulatory Review Conference in New Orleans,Louisiana, December 10-14, 1979, and invited all interested persons tosubmit proposed regulatory changes for consideration pursuant to Notice79-1 (44 FR 3250, January 15, 1979). One of the proposals discussed atthe conference dealt with design precautions to minimize hazards from anengine rotor failure. The proposal was subsequently deferred because ofinsufficient service history. Service experience indicates that hazardous rotor bursts continue to occurin most of the standard engine types used in rotorcraft, and that the occurrencerate now justifies proposing a regulatory change. A recent review indicatesa history of 59 reported, uncontained rotor bursts since 1980. Many ofthese rotor bursts occurred in engines used in nontransport or in militaryaircraft. However, the data are relevant to part 29 because the enginesinvolved are similar or identical to those used in civil transport rotorcraftand are operated in either a similar or less severe manner. For example,rotorcraft engines, in many instances, have turboprop or turbojet enginecounterparts which exhibit rotor burst failure modes similar to those inpart 29 rotorcraft even while operating under less severe conditions thanrotorcraft.This proposal is also prompted by an accident history which has resultedin the FAA issuing several airworthiness directives (AD) for certain typesof engines used in U.S. type-certificated helicopters throughout the world.These AD's contain requirements such as (1) emergency engine shutdown andlanding to prevent catastrophic accidents due to uncontained rotor burstswhich could occur following certain abnormal engine instrument fluctuationsor (2) addition of protective plates to shield against a rotor burst. Ifadopted, this proposal would obviate much of the need for further AD actionin other products. <ITAG tagnum="84">National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Recommendation</ITAG>This proposal also addresses NTSB Safety Recommendation A-84-60, datedJune 14, 1984, which recommends that the engine compartment design of allU.S. type certificated multiengined helicopters be reviewed with regardto the probability that an uncontained engine failure will result in catastrophicdamage to the drive train, electrical, fuel and hydraulic system componentsand recommends rulemaking to effect the appropriate changes. <ITAG tagnum="84">Reference Material </ITAG>Existing design standards, state-of-the-art design technology, and currentFAA technical data bases were carefully examined with respect to this proposal.A summary of that review follows. High energy rotor fragment containment, other design standards, and methodologiesfor minimizing rotor burst hazards have been the subjects of numerous safetystudies. These studies have recommended use of design techniques whichwill minimize rotor burst hazards; these techniques range from the useof containment shielding to the use of critical component shielding and/ordispersal. A document of particular interest is FAA Order 8110.11, ``DesignConsiderations for Minimizing Damage Caused By Uncontained Aircraft TurbineEngine Rotor Failures,'' dated November 19, 1975, to be reissued as anadvisory circular (AC) in the AC 20 series. Order 8110.11 is importantto this proposal because it considers the minimum design standards in termsof the worst-case rotor fragment size and energy level. These design considerationsinclude one-third of the disk mass being released at the critical rotorburst speed. Such an energized fragment has been considered in previousanalyses and tests used by certification applicants to evaluate rotor bursthazards. Order 8110.11 discusses in detail the critical speeds and associatedfragment energy levels that should be considered. To substantiate the technical feasibility of this new proposal, relativeto the current state-of-the-art, a survey of current literature was conducted.Considerable government and industry research is available on rotor burstcontainment and in related fields such as lightweight armor. Key researchdocuments reviewed in support of this proposal and contained in the docketare as follows: (1) AIR4003, ``Report on Aircraft Engine Containment,'' Society of AutomotiveEngineers, Inc., Seventh Draft, February 1, 1987, 400 Commonwealth Drive,Warrendale, PA 15096.(2) National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Report No. CP-2017,``An Assessment of Technology for Turbojet Engine Rotor Failures,'' datedAugust 1977 (available from the National Technical Information Service,Springfield, Virginia 22161), which contains a research anthology. (3) ``Analysis Methods for Kevlar Shield Response to Rotor Fragments,''dated August 1977, by J. H. Gerstle, Boeing Commercial Airplane Company,Seattle, WA. (4) ``Ceramic Composite Protection for Turbine Disc Bursts,'' circa 1977,by P. B. Gardner, Industrial Ceramics Division, Norton Company, New BondStreet, Worcester, MA 01606.(5) Report No. NAPTC-PE-98, ``Rotor Burst Protection Program: Experimentto Provide Guidelines for the Design of Turbine Burst Fragment ContainmentRings,'' dated March 1977, Naval Air Propulsion Test Center, Trenton, NewJersey.(6) National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Report TMX-73633,``Concepts for the Development of Light-Weight Composite Structures forRotor Burst Containment,'' dated 1977.Numerous other papers on rotor burst protection have been presented atvarious technical symposiums. Further, most engine manufacturers have conductedextensive research (for both civil and military applications) in containmentmethodology. A survey of the literature shows that protection from turboshaftengine rotor burst is well within the current state of the art for smallto medium size engines common to rotorcraft; therefore, adoption of thisproposal would impose no undue technological burden on the industry. <ITAG tagnum="84">Related Rulemaking Activity</ITAG>This proposal parallels rules that currently exist in parts 23 and 25 forairplanes. The rule in part 23, adopted in Amendment 23-30, for normalcategory airplanes was effective on March 26, 1984 (49 FR 7340, February28, 1984). Since very few of these aircraft have been certificated sinceAmendment 23-30, no significant service history is available to determineits effect. The rule in part 25, adopted in Amendment 25-23, for transportcategory airplanes has been in effect since April 1970 (35 FR 5673, April8, 1970), and a significant beneficial service history has been established;i.e., since adoption of Amendment 25-23, few accidents of transport airplaneshave resulted from uncontained rotor bursts. <ITAG tagnum="84">General Discussion of Proposals</ITAG>The fact that parts 23 and 25 contain rotor burst hazard protection andpart 29 does not is a regulatory and safety dichotomy because fixed-wingaircraft are by geometry less vulnerable to rotor burst hazards than rotorcraft.Fixed-wing aircraft are already protected from the rotor burst hazard,although it is less critical for them than such protection is for rotorcraft.There is, therefore, a significant safety incentive for adoption of thisproposal. The degree of damage from a rotor burst in a fixed-wing aircraft is typicallyfar less catastrophic than that resulting from a similar rotor burst ina conventional rotorcraft. This is because rotorcraft are very compactand have nearly all of their critical components colocated. A fixed-wingaircraft is less compact, and its critical components are dispersed makingit less vulnerable to high energy fragments than a similarly sized rotorcraft.Use of fixed-wing aircraft service history to aid in quantifying proposedbenefits for rotorcraft is conservative in the safety and economic senses.Safety and economic benefits from rotor burst protection for a given rotorcraftdesign could be as much as 10 times that for a similar fixed-wing aircraftdesign. Fixed development costs for either design would be essentiallythe same. This is true even when using the fixed-wing aircraft rotor burstdata conservatively. Airplane designers typically use existing design features for rotor burstprotection not available in rotorcraft including the following: Relativelywide engine separation; dispersed redundant structure; widely separatedand/or redundant primary controls; hydraulic, pneumatic, and electricalsystems; and powerplant operating regimes characterized by long term stableoperation at lower power settings which greatly limit rotor burst initiationand damage.Conversely, designers of conventional rotorcraft, with rare exception,must locate the engines side-by-side within the fuselage contours. Therotorcraft designer must also locate the following directly within theimmediate rotor fragmentation zone: primary controls; critical single loadpath structure; critical rotor drive system components; fuel cells; criticalhydraulic, pneumatic, and electrical system components; personnel compartments;and the main lifting rotor. The inherent rotorcraft side-by-side powerplant arrangement has resultedin at least seven instances in which a rotor burst has caused the failureof the remaining adjacent engine. In one instance a rotor burst penetratedan adjacent fuel tank and caused a severe fire. In other instances therotor burst severed closely located, critical flight control system components.A realistic consideration of the rotor burst service history, design constraints,and optimum state-of-the-art design requirements for rotor burst containmentsuggests a design solution that embodies either airframe or integral enginecontainment shielding. A requirement for shielding would, of course, causean increase in design, manufacturing, weight penalty, and testing costs.However, any recurring costs, such as those due to increased weight andmanufacturing, would eventually be absorbed (at least partially) by naturalimprovements in material and design technology which occur in the aircraftindustry. An alternate solution would be to revise part 33 to require integrationof the containment shield into appropriate sections of the engine case.Certainly an engine case which met this objective would provide an acceptablelevel of safety and, thus, meet the requirements of this proposal. However,the FAA is proposing to place the requirement in part 29 to address possiblefuture certification questions that concern the installation eligibilityof a previously type-certificated engine, which does not have rotor burstprotection, in a subsequently type-certificated rotorcraft airframe (i.e.,rotor burst protection would be provided by airframe design, not specialengine design). Also, placing the requirement in part 29 would encouragedevelopment of future configurations which may not use a containment ring,but may use more sophisticated technology beyond the current state-of-the-art.For these reasons, the alternate proposal to mandate the containment shieldin part 33 is not being considered at this time. <ITAG tagnum="84">Specific Discussion of Proposals</ITAG>Section 29.901The FAA is proposing that the minimum level of safety be increased by requiringconsideration of failure of engine rotor discs unless such failure is shownto be extremely remote. Since this proposed new requirement would be inconsistentwith existing paragraph (c)(2), it would be removed and existing paragraphs(c) and (c)(1) would be combined as shown in the proposal. Section 29.903For turbine engine installations, the FAA is proposing to revise paragraph(f) to state explicitly that design precautions must be taken to minimizethe hazard to the rotorcraft in the event of an engine rotor failure. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation Summary</ITAG>Benefits_Cost EvaluationThis economic impact evaluation compares the benefits and costs of theproposed regulation on a per-rotorcraft basis with the rotorcraft varyingin size from 8 to 20 seats; as such, it reduces dependence on forecastsof the size and the number of new transport rotorcraft produced. For purposes of this evaluation, it is assumed that a Category A or B transportrotorcraft with two engines will be certificated under this proposed rule.Also, it is assumed that the rotor of each engine will be enclosed by aring of material that is sufficient to contain fragments from a rotor burst,and that the costs of these rings will not vary significantly because ofthe relatively small variation in size among transport rotorcraft engines.The benefits derived from the containment ring will, however, increaseas the size of the rotorcraft increases. Costs of Compliance The proposed requirement could be satisfied by shielding each engine witha containment ring (e.g., one previously approved containment device consistsof a 6-pound laminated ring made from boron-carbide with fiberglass backing);this conclusion is based on an assessment of typical rotorcraft designsusing standard state-of-the-art materials and manufacturing technology,and an assessment of the previously cited certification experience of amajor manufacturer. The one-time cost to a manufacturer of transport rotorcraftfor developing these composite material rings is estimated to be $330 perrotorcraft produced, and the estimated manufacturing cost per containmentring is $480. Since a twin-engine transport rotorcraft would require twocontainment rings, the increase in cost of manufacturing rotorcraft certificatedunder these proposed requirements would be twice $480 plus $330 or $1,290.Rotorcraft operators would experience an increase in the operating costof transport rotorcraft certificated under this proposed rule as a resultof the additional weight of the two containment rings. The estimated annualcost per pound of additional weight is $37.13; therefore, the 12-poundweight of the two containment rings is estimated to increase the operatingcost for a twin-engine transport rotorcraft by $445.56 annually. The presentvalue of the increase in the total cost of purchasing and operating twin-enginetransport rotorcraft, over 15 years, certificated under this proposed rulewould be $4,254. For a more detailed explanation of the estimation of thesecosts, see the regulatory evaluation included in the docket. Benefit Estimation The value of the rotorcraft destroyed or damaged is one of the determinantsof the benefits of this proposed regulation with regard to eliminatingproperty losses due to uncontained rotor burst. The expected annual benefitper seat in preventing rotorcraft property loss by containing a possibleturbine burst is estimated to be $47.90. The value assigned to casualtiesis also one of the determinants of the benefits of this proposed regulationwith regard to eliminating casualties due to uncontained rotor burst inrotorcraft. In this evaluation, the statistical value of a human life isset at $1 million; the cost of a serious rotorcraft injury is estimatedto be $390,900; and the cost of a minor rotorcraft injury is estimatedto be $25,100. Based on these assumptions, the expected casualty preventionbenefits per year are estimated to be $571.75 per seat. The present value of the benefits of this proposal would vary with thesize of the rotorcraft_the larger the rotorcraft, the greater the benefits.Using FAA critical values for human life, injuries, and rotorcraft replacementand repair, the estimated benefits are $619.65 per seat per year, and theestimated present value of these benefits over 15 years is $4,285 per seat.Since the estimated present value of the benefits from the proposed ruleexceeds the estimated present value of the costs of this proposal, theFAA, therefore, has determined that this proposed regulation would be costbeneficial. Trade Impact Statement The costs which may be imposed by this proposal will not result in a competitivetrade disadvantage for U.S. manufacturers in the U.S. market. Foreign manufacturerswould have to comply with the proposed regulation as a condition for exportingtheir rotorcraft to the United States. Foreign manufacturers are expectedto comply with these proposed regulations since the United States is theirlargest market. In foreign markets, neither U.S. manufacturers nor foreignmanufacturers can be required to comply with these proposed standards.Therefore, U.S. manufacturers will not be at a competitive disadvantagein foreign markets. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Determination </ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 requires Federal agenciesto specifically review rules which may have a ``significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.'' The FAA small entity standardsdefine a small rotorcraft manufacturer as an independently owned and managedfirm having fewer then 75 employees. There are currently only three manufacturersin the United States that produce rotorcraft certificated under part 29,and all three have more than 75 employees. Therefore, under the FAA sizestandard criteria, there are no small manufacturers that will be affectedby this proposed change to part 29. Small rotorcraft operators are notnecessarily affected by this proposed rule since they will not be requiredto purchase rotorcraft certificated under this proposed regulation. Thus,the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implication </ITAG>The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings inthe Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the International Trade ImpactAnalysis, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is not majorunder Executive Order 12291. In addition, the FAA certifies that this proposal,if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act. This proposal is considered nonsignificant under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979).
