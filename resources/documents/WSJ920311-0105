Lego's compensation last year by $1.5 million after ayear of financial turmoil, but offered him lucrative stockand cash incentives to turn the company around.   Mr. Lego, who is 61 years old, earned a salary of $677,083in 1991, up slightly from his base pay in 1990. However, inthat year, Mr. Lego also received another $1.5 million inannual and long-term incentive bonuses, as well as the optionto buy 124,000 shares at $36.53 each.</LP><TEXT>   Westinghouse directors, while eliminating any bonus in1991, are offering Mr. Lego 700,000 shares at $22.28 each asan incentive to turn the company around, and another $1.1million to meet unspecified goals by 1993, according to thecompany's 1992 proxy statement.   In the last 52 weeks, Westinghouse shares have traded atbetween $30.50 and $13.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.Yesterday, Westinghouse closed at $19.50, down 25 cents.   In his letter to shareholders in the company'sjust-released annual report, Mr. Lego expressed doubts aboutthe company's outlook in coming months. &quot;Few of ouroperations have seen evidence of any near-term rebounding ofthe nation's economy,&quot; Mr. Lego wrote. Moreover, in a newfiling with the Securities and Exchange Commission, thecredit unit warned that a continued recession and weak realestate markets &quot;could result in increased credit losses andadditional reserves.&quot; Over the last four quarters,Westinghouse took $2.6 billion in pretax charges as a resultof loan losses, mainly real estate properties, in its creditunit.   The credit unit's problems aren't entirely over. Accordingto the SEC filing, the credit unit is being sued for $900million by several real estate concerns controlled bydevelopers Bob and Ed Tonti of New Orleans. The lawsuitalleges, in part, that Westinghouse concealed foreclosed realestate properties as mortgage loans so that both the companyand developers could wait for the value of the properties tobe restored. The lawsuit alleges that Westinghouse latertried to collect on those supposed mortgage loans from theTontis. Westinghouse denies any wrongdoing.   Westinghouse directors, while cutting Mr. Lego'scompensation, generously rewarded Leo W. Yochum, the formerchief financial officer lured out of retirement lastSeptember to run Westinghouse's troubled financial servicesunit. The board awarded the 64-year-old Mr. Yochum $800,000up front and another $80,000 a month for up to 12 months.Though a member of the board, Mr. Yochum doesn't receiveboard member compensation.   Westinghouse directors also cut the pay of the company's14 top executives, reducing their total compensation to about$4 million from nearly $11 million the previous year. Forexample, Ted Stern, senior executive vice president in chargeof power generation, received base pay of $360,000 in 1991,down from $820,826, while B.B. Staniar, chairman of thecompany's broadcast unit, received $354,996, down from$729,996, and executive vice president and general counsel R.F. Pugliese received $304,494, down from $684,664.</TEXT></DOC>
