Other than salaried Biden campaign workers, can there be many people this morning who care one way or the other that the presidential race no longer includes Joe Biden? When Joe Biden stumbled, did any Democrat hold out a hand of support?    Gary Hart ran his candidacy across two presidential campaigns. He was the &quot;front runner,&quot; which presumably meant something. When he fell, the loudest sound in Washington was of people tittering. If the Gephardt or Dukakis candidacies should break up on the rocks next week, no recongnizable constituency would lose sleep.    Senator Biden has been carrying water for 30 or more anti-Bork pressure groups. As he tried to hold together both his candidacy and his chairmanship, none of the groups offered public support. Wasn't Joe Biden one of their own? Organized groups claiming to represent women, various minorities and other interests demand obeisances from presidential candidates, and they get them. It's obvious, however, that the pressure groups feel they owe these candidates nothing. If one of their pack horses falls, they'll push him into the ditch and saddle up another.    But if loyalty is dead and opportunism ascendant among the activists, perhaps it's because the activists have paid close attention to the candidates.    Joe Biden didn't stand for much of anything that sticks in the mind. Neither did Gary Hart. At yesterday's news conference, Mr. Biden described the core values of his candidacy as &quot;idealism and compassion.&quot; The two candidates who've collapsed are products of modern Washington. Washington politicians today have their positions so hedged and muddied up that it is impossible to know exactly what they stand for. Spending decisions, for example, are Congress's greatest responsibility, yet the Members are now so afraid of casting recorded votes on individual programs that their largest effort this session has been rebuilding a law that will make &quot;automatic&quot; spending cuts.    Washington today fears accountability. A politician willing to accept clear accountability for his beliefs or his votes needs to have identifiable principles. Without clear political principles, a candidate is unlikely to receive deep support or loyalty from many people. In the contemporary political marketplace, whatever loyalty attaches to candidacies such as those of Messrs. Hart and Biden is clearly fungible.    The Democratic Party's candidates need to adopt at least one page from Ronald Reagan's playbook. They need to stand for something people can be confidently for or against. Absent that, the group invites derision. People used to talk about them in terms of a fairy tale. As they fall, the talk will turn to nursery rhymes &quot;Ten little nine little eight little Indians, seven little six little five little Indians. . . .&quot; That will stop when one of these candidates shows evidence that it deserves to stop. </TEXT></DOC>
