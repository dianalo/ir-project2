The charge will coverseverance payments, management consolidations and certainexpenses associated with divestitures.   Raychem said excluding the one-time charge and taxes,results in the quarter ended March 31 were at about thebreak-even level, reflecting a larger-than-expected drop inits defense business. Sales were about 5% above theyear-earlier quarter's level of $270 million &quot;in constantcurrency,&quot; Raychem said. A spokesman said that since about60% of sales come from international markets, currencyfluctuations could change final sales results.</LP><TEXT>   Raychem makes aerospace, automotive, electronics andtelecommunications products. Its stock closed yesterday at$27.75, down 25 cents, in composite trading on the New YorkStock Exchange.   In the year-earlier third quarter, Raychem took a one-timecharge of $10.7 million for certain programs intended to&quot;improve corporate efficiency.&quot; In that quarter, Raychemposted net income of $2.4 million, or seven cents a sharefully diluted, down 92% from a year earlier.   Raychem has seen several quarters of declining profits,which the company has blamed, in part, on losses from itsRaynet unit. That unit, which designs fiber-optics systems,is still developing products and markets. A spokesman saidRaynet is expected to cost the company about $60 million thisfiscal year, ending June 30. However, Raychem said it&quot;remains fully committed&quot; to the Raynet unit, wheretechnology trials now under way are showing &quot;encouragingresults.&quot;   The company will cut its work force by 8%, dismissing 900workers to reduce staff to about 10,500. Raychem also said itwill consolidate certain management and administrative jobs,and sell undeveloped land in Menlo Park, Calif. Raychem saidit plans to acquire manufacturing sites in other,less-expensive parts of the U.S.   In addition, Raychem plans to sell its Advanced PackagingSystems division, which makes products to enhancecommunications among integrated circuits, and much of itsshape memory alloy business, which makes metals for theaerospace industry.   Raychem said the moves are intended to reduce ongoingexpenses but a spokesman wouldn't estimate how much moneywill be saved. Raychem said once the moves are implemented,it expects the costs to be recovered over two to three years.   For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1989, the companyposted net income of $36.3 million, or $1.02 a fully dilutedshare, on sales of $1.08 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
