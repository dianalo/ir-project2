The mark dropped almost a pfennig against the dollar andslipped about a third of a yen after rallying against bothcurrencies on Tuesday. The pound, bolstered by BritishChancellor of the Exchequer John Major's remarks supportingcontinued high interest rates, rose about 1 1/2 pfennigsagainst the mark.</LP><TEXT>   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quotedat 1.6830 marks, up from 1.6740 marks late Tuesday, and at151.45 yen, up from 151.25 yen late Tuesday. Sterling wasquoted at $1.6950, up from $1.6940 late Tuesday.   In Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was trading soon after theopening at 151.62 yen, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of150.75 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about1.6830 marks.   The mark's decline came despite a steady stream ofpositive-sounding statements about unification by West Germanmonetary authorities and news that the West Germancost-of-living index rose a preliminary 0.2% in May.   Anticipation of a moderate cost-of-living figure hadhelped the West German currency post gains Tuesday, and pastremarks by West German authorities suggesting that theprocess of unification is well in hand have helped boost themark.   But both the inflation news and the remarks on unificationwere overshadowed yesterday by a burst of pessimism about thechances for a smooth transition to one Germany, participantssaid.   The closer unification gets, the more &quot;people are wary,&quot;said Jack Griffin, a vice president and corporate trader atBanque Indosuez in New York.   The election of the maverick Yeltsin to the presidency ofthe huge Russian Republic added to traders' nervousnessbecause he is seen as a rival to Soviet President MikhailGorbachev and possibly a further destabilizing influencewithin the already tumultuous Soviet political scene. Mr.Gorbachev recently has been widely perceived as havingpolitical trouble at home despite successes overseas.   The issue of a united Germany's membership in the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization is likely to be discussed at theU.S.-Soviet summit meeting that begins today in Washington.Market participants will watch the summit carefully becausethe two sides may find it difficult to compromise on thatissue, traders said.   Chief among the slew of statements by West Germanofficials yesterday was Bundesbank President Karl OttoPoehl's remark that the central bank is &quot;very satisfied&quot; withthe state treaty between East and West Germany on economicand social unification. Rumors of a split between theBundesbank and government over the treaty had been weighingon the West German currency recently, and the mark enjoyed aslight rebound against the dollar after news of the commentat midafternoon New York time, but soon lost its gain oncontinued selling.   Earlier, Bundesbank directorate member Hans Tietmeyer saidthere is no extreme threat of inflation in West Germany dueto unification, a comment supported from the government sideby Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann, who said that thecentral bank will take appropriate action to keep West Germaninflation below a 3% annual rate after July 2, when thetreaty on unification takes effect.   Mr. Griffin of Banque Indosuez noted that the potentialimpact of the statements by West German officials was dilutedby the perception that the remarks were politically motivatedas different forces within West Germany jockey for positionbefore unification and coming national elections.
