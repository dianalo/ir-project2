I don't think so.andO;Certainly, some important meetings will once again become face-to-face.andP;  Butthe benefits of videoconferencing are huge, not only in the cost of airfareand hotels, but in the cost of time spent sending people on those airlines tothose hotels.andP;  If people can be productive in a videoconference setting, forany type of meeting, I believe they'll find it impossible to go to the oldway of doing business.andP;  Anyone who does will find their costs increased,their profits reduced, and their competitors taking it out of their hide.andM;It's ironic that it should take a war to jump-start an industry which hasbeen in place for nearly a decade.andP;  But it should not be a surprise.andP;  Absenta war, the current recession could have provided some spur tovideoconferencing, as it has to areas from telecommuting to telemarketing,whose worth is only proven under pressure.andM;Frederick Schumputer, the German economist, called the beneficial aspects ofthe business cycle &quot;creative destruction.&quot; Change forces weak firms out ofbusiness and benefits the strong.andP;  War does the same to nations.andP;  Only timewill tell the true impact of Operation Desert Storm on the U.S., Iraq, theMiddle East, and the global balance of power.andP;  But already, some permanentchanges are on the line.andM;(Dana Blankenhorn/19910201)</TEXT></DOC>
