In a 2-1 decision released Tuesday, the 1st District Court ofAppeal said the owners had a duty to preserve the car if theyshould have known it was needed by an opposing party in the case.   The ruling reinstated a claim by Solano County against thefamily of Brian Delancy, driver of a car that overturned in August1985, injuring Delancy and a passenger.   The passenger, Faith Lynn Owens, sued Delancy, his parents, E.W.and Katherine Delancy, and the county, blaming the crash oncareless driving, negligent entrustment of the car to the youth,and an unsafe road.   The county, seeking to reduce its own damages, then filed aclaim against the Delancys, saying the car had been defective.   The county said it should be entitled to reimbursement from theDelancys because the family had destroyed the car before theoriginal suit was filed, allegedly after inspecting the car andfinding defects.   Superior Court Judge Richard Harris dismissed the claim based oncar's destruction.   But the appeals court disagreed.   The opinion by Justice James Perley said the county was entitledto seek reimbursement for any harm it suffered if it could provethe Delancys either knew or should have known that the car wasneeded as evidence when they destroyed it.   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Carl Anderson said the rulingwould impose a burden by forcing owners to preserve wrecked carsindefinitely, without having been sued or notified of the need tokeep the car intact.   ``The owner of all wrecked cars will now be forced to store thewreck (or drive the partly damaged car without repair) for anintolerable period of time,'' Anderson said. ``What littlelandscape our ever-encroaching `civilization' has left will henceforward be transformed into one giant junkyard.''   Perley, joined by Justice Marc Poche, dismissed Anderson'sprediction as hyperbole.   The Delancys could have fulfilled any duty they owed by writingto the county and saying they planned to destroy the car on acertain date unless the county took over the cost of preserving it,Perley said.   ``The `intolerable burden' we supposedly place on parties in theDelancys' position is no more than the cost of copying andpostage,'' Perley said.</TEXT></DOC>
