Yes, but just barely.    While Mondays are usually slow, yesterday's ho-hum Nasdaq volume of 98.2 million shares was only the fourth time in 94 trading sessions this year that volume slipped under the 100 million mark. The previous time was last Monday, when 97.8 million shares changed hands.    Unlike the New York Stock Exchange, OTC traders generally don't have big dividend-capturing action -- such as that involving GTE Corp. stock yesterday on the Big Board -- to compensate for the lack of action on dull days.    The Nasdaq 100 index of the largest OTC industrials closed at 349.97, up 2.28, or 0.66%. That was a bit behind yesterday's 0.86% rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 blue chips.    Nasdaq's composite index, which includes all 4,660 Nasdaq securities, rose 0.87 to 373.35, only a 0.23% gain.    OTC trading, already moribund because of a lack of small investors willing to play, was nearly paralyzed yesterday with jitters ahead of today's March trade deficit numbers. Many OTC buyers were waiting to see what effect the new numbers have on big stocks on the exchanges before planning their next OTC moves, traders said.    &quot;It continues a trend that's been set in the last few weeks of people sitting on the sidelines,&quot; said William Rothe, managing director and head of OTC trading at Alex. Brown andamp; Sons in Baltimore. Mr. Rothe said that despite some last-minute buying in such Nasdaq behemoths as Apple Computer and MCI Communications, &quot;by and large you've got people sitting back waiting for the trade figures.&quot;    Apple, Nasdaq's largest stock, closed at 41 1/4, up 3/4, on 663,500 shares, and MCI finished 1/4 higher at 14 1/4 on 1.5 million shares. MCI said late in the day that it had completed the acquisition of General Electric Co.'s RCA Global Communications Inc. unit for about $160 million.    It was a bad day for Seattle-based companies on Nasdaq. Shares of one of them, Pay'n Save, led all decliners by plunging 2 7/8 to 3 1/2, a 45% fall, on heavy volume of 704,900 shares. The drugstore operator agreed to sell 147 stores -- its sole assets -- to Pacific Enterprises' Thrifty Corp. unit for about $232 million in stock. While Pacific agreed to share some profits with Pay'n Save if they exceed a certain level, attainment of that level appears unlikely, analysts said.    Pay'n Save had risen 2 1/16 to 6 15/16 last week as rumors flew about a possible completion of takeover talks.    Shares in another Seattle company, American Passage Marketing, fell 2 1/8 to 5 1/2, a 27.8% drop. The photographic services concern, which agreed to be acquired by management and others in December for about $8.75 a share, said the expected senior lender in the buy-out terminated its previous commitment letter for financing.    Pantera's, one of the most heavily short-sold stocks on Nasdaq, rose 5/8 to 7 3/4 on heavy volume of 710,800 shares, nearly 10 times its average daily turnover. As of last month, Pantera's had a 1.2 million-share short position, or an amount of shares that had been sold by investors hoping the stock's price would decline. Some of those short sellers in the St. Louis-based pizza chain were spooked by a bullish article -- &quot;This Pizza Maker Could Deliver&quot; -- in the May 23 issue of Business Week.    Longview Fibre jumped 2 1/2 to 51. The company announced second-quarter earnings of $2.66 a share, up from $1.38 a share a year earlier. The Longview, Wash., concern owns and operates tree farms that produce logs and wood pulp and markets paper products.    Some 35.5 million shares in 965 issues rose yesterday, while 23.3 million in 925 issues declined. There were 83 new highs and 44 new lows. Although Nasdaq's utilities index rose the most of all the system's subindexes -- up 2.02 to 426.61, a 0.48% rise -- that index is heavily weighted toward some big telecommunications and broadcasting issues, including MCI. </TEXT></DOC>
