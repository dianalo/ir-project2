Week-old strikes continued to disrupt service in another 15states.   Strikes began at 12:01 a.m. local time Sunday against MichiganBell, Ohio Bell, Indiana Bell, Illinois Bell and Wisconsin Bell,all subsidiaries of Ameritech, said Steve Rosenthal, a spokesmanfor the Communications Workers of America in Washington.   But Rosenthal and Mark Belkin, a CWA spokesman, said earlySunday that progress had been made in negotiations withSouthwestern Bell and U S West. Talks continued past midnightdeadlines.   ``We've passed the deadline,'' Belkin said just minutes pastmidnight Sunday. ``Reports from the negotiating table are thatthere is progress being made. There has been a call for anextension of the contract. However, we understand large numbers ofworkers are walking out of buildings and not abiding by theextension.''   U S West spokeswoman Debbie Thomas said, ``What we've heard isthat they've stopped the clock ... and they're going to continuebargaining. Obviously, the assumption is that they must be close orelse they probably wouldn't continue to bargain.''   In the Southwestern Bell negotiations, company spokesman DavidMartin said the company gave the union a new proposal about 15minutes before the strike deadline, which had 41,000 unionemployees in five states poised to walk out.   ``I think we're still hopeful we can get a contract,'' Martinsaid. He said the issues still on the table dealt with wages andhealth benefits.   But negotiations with the Chicago-based Ameritech, which serves12.3 million customers and has nearly 40,000 CWA workers, collapsedlate Saturday.   ``We were unable to reach a fair agreement with the (Ameritech)companies,'' Rosenthal said. ``We are prepared to continue tonegotiate, but at this point we are on strike.''   The three so-called ``Baby Bells'' met with or exchangedproposals and counterproposals Saturday with representatives of theCWA and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.   The unions set a midnight deadline for walkouts, local time.   Strikes by the two unions against three other regional telephonecompanies _ Bell Atlantic, Pacific Telesis and NYNEX _ began lastweekend. A seventh Baby Bell, Atlanta-based BellSouth, was the onlyone to reach a tentative settlement last weekend.   The Baby Bell companies were created by the 1984 breakup ofAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph, which was not directly affected bythis month's walkouts. ATandamp;T settled with the two communicationsunions earlier this year. Officials at the regional companiesalready on strike said last week that most direct-dial calls weregoing through normally on automated equipment, but the walkoutsdisrupted repair services, operator-assisted calls, and inquiriesto directory assistance. Those strikes affected 15 states and theDistrict of Columbia.   Rosenthal said the key issues dividing the unions and the phonecompanies were wage increases and management efforts to makeworkers help pay health insurance costs.   Various local issues are also being discussed. In some cases,the talks involve Baby Bell subsidiaries as well as the mainregional companies.   Companies made strike preparations, including briefingmanagement employees on filling union jobs. U S West said itplanned to pull its advertising from various media outlets Mondayif there is a strike, in order to reduce demand for services.   ``Normally, we advertise to stimulate business,'' said U S Westspokeswoman Debbie Thomas. ``If we get in a strike situation, wewould not want to overload our business offices.''   The regional companies that faced Saturday strike deadlines were:   _ U S West, based in Englewood, Colo., serving 11.8 millionlines in 14 states: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota,Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota,Utah, Washington and Wyoming. It has 42,000 CWA workers and 2,000IBEW workers, according to Rosenthal.   _ Southwestern Bell, based in St. Louis, serving 11 millioncustomers in Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. It has44,000 CWA, no IBEW workers.   _ Ameritech, based in Chicago, serving 12.3 million customers inIllinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. It has 39,500 CWAworkers, who are continuing talks, and 18,000 IBEW workers, most ofwhom have reached a separate settlement with one Ameritechsubsidiary, Illinois Bell.   Walkouts continued at San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis, whichprovides service in northern Nevada and all of California;Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic, which serves Delaware, Maryland,New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the Districtof Columbia; and New York-based NYNEX, which serves all or parts ofNew York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maine, New Hampshire,Vermont, and Connecticut.   No formal talks were held Saturday in those walkouts. However,informal talks were held in the Bell Atlantic strike, and CWAofficials told the compnay they were prepared to bargain around theclock, Rosenthal said.   The one Baby Bell that settled, Atlanta-based BellSouth,provides service in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana,Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. Acontract with its 64,000 CWA workers late Aug. 5 averted a walkout.</TEXT></DOC>
