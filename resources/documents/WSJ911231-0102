This holiday season, shoppers arebuying stocks.   With short-term interest rates falling through the floorand stock prices going through the roof, small investors arestampeding out of money-market funds and certificates ofdeposit into stocks. Yesterday, the Dow Jones IndustrialAverage soared 62.39 points, its sixth straight gain in a250-point run since Dec. 20.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Our lobby is packed right now,&quot; says Brian Mattes, aspokesman for Vanguard Group, where investors flooded into awalk-in investment center at Vanguard's headquarters inValley Forge, Pa.   Many small investors said they were buying stocksyesterday because they feel equities are the only place to bewith returns so low on competing investments. &quot;Holding cashin your portfolio is worthless,&quot; says Tom Collins, owner of amobile home company in Athens, Ga. &quot;If you are buying CDs,you are buying Certificates of Depreciation. The stock marketis the only place to be right now.&quot;   Charles Schwab andamp; Co., the nation's biggest discountbroker, boosted its staff of telephone order takers by 15%from the normal holiday levels.   This month, &quot;people have been rolling out of certificatesof deposit in record amounts at a time when rates are attheir lowest level in two decades,&quot; says Mark Thompson, aSchwab spokesman. Instead of CD's, Mr. Thompson said,investors have been putting their money into individualstocks, growth-stock mutual funds and stock index funds thataim to match broad market averages.   Money is cascading into stock mutual funds as investorsscramble to get a piece of the year-end rally. Fund groupssay the big winners are growth-stock funds, particularlythose that specialize in smaller-company stocks. FidelityInvestments, the giant Boston fund group, says it's havingits best month for stock fund sales since 1987.   &quot;We've been extremely busy all day,&quot; reports Robert Sciba,manager of Fidelity's Southfield, Mich., investment center.&quot;The market has been drumming up a lot of interest.&quot;   Other fund groups also report strong interest amongindividual investors. Scudder, Stevens andamp; Clark is enjoyingits best monthly stock fund sales since last February, whenthe market rallied on the quick end to the Persian Gulf War.And Massachusetts Financial Services hasn't seen a month likethis since May 1990. At both fund groups, the best-sellingfund has been a small-company stock fund.   &quot;It's a nice Christmas present,&quot; says Gavin Quill, amarketing analyst with Scudder. &quot;December is usually a weakmonth for equity sales, because some people hold off frombuying&quot; as a result of the year-end income and capital-gainsdistributions that are made by stock mutual funds. Mutualfund shareholders have to pay taxes on those distributions,even if they have only recently bought fund shares.   Fidelity's Mr. Sciba says investors are most interested inthree types of stocks funds, those specializing in growthstocks, small-company stocks and health care stocks. &quot;A lotof people are concerned about the market being at an all-timehigh,&quot; he says. &quot;But they're forging right ahead. Folks rightnow are not happy about the yields they're getting on CDs andshort-term instruments.&quot;   Ellis Traub, 61 years old, a retired airline pilot wholives in Miami, says he still has some free cash available inhis portfolio and is looking for stocks that are good values.&quot;There are still some things out there to buy,&quot; he says.Yesterday, his son purchased shares in Community PsychiatricCenters Inc., a chain of acute psychiatric hospitals, hesays.   Some investors say they're nervous about buying growthstocks and other issues when they have just risen to newhighs. Peggy Schmeltz of Bowling Green, Ohio, says she wasbuying smaller companies whose prices haven't been &quot;caught upin this.&quot; She says she bought shares in two over-the-countercompanies yesterday whose prices &quot;have dropped but still hadgood earnings.&quot; They are Clearly Canadian Beverage Inc., amarketer of mineral water and soda, and Osmonics Inc., acompany that makes filters.   Mrs. Schmeltz says she thinks that investors who buypopular growth stocks like Wal-Mart Stores Inc., U.S.Surgical Corp. and Home Depot Inc. may get hurt. &quot;Theirprices are astronomical,&quot; she says. Mrs. Schmeltz holdspositions in all these stocks and says she would buy more ifthe market drops &quot;100 or 200 points.&quot;   Some investors say they're so anxious about the highprices and the outlook for the economy that they haven'tjoined the stock-buying frenzy. John K. Byerlein, anindustrial products sales manager in Newport Beach, Calif.,says he remained in short-term bonds, &quot;sitting on thesidelines because I am still nervous.&quot;   Mr. Byerlein says he realizes &quot;I have missed a verysplendid overall market. I have some regrets. I missed thismove. But I will be ready for the next one.&quot; Still bearish,he's looking for &quot;a market adjustment to 2300 or 2350&quot; on theDow Jones industrials.   Mr. Collins, the Athens, Ga., business owner who is fullyinvested, says he, too, is concerned about the high prices.&quot;I am nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rockingchairs,&quot; he says. &quot;I feel I should take some profits but Ihaven't. My biggest question is: When is enough enough?&quot;   The market rally is good news for the nation's stockbrokers. Steven Guggenheimer, a broker at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.in Manhattan, says the buoyant market has made customers morereceptive to his calls. &quot;It's a lot easier to call clientswith the news that the market is up 50 points than just towish them a happy new year. The conversation is muchfriendlier.&quot;   Mr. Guggenheimer says one client who has done well in thecurrent rally with holdings such as Gillette Co., Coca-ColaCo., and Wal-Mart asked him for a new recommendationyesterday. His response: Archer-Daniels-Midland, the soy andcorn syrup producer. &quot;I think it's still got some growthpotential. And historically, it's paid a 5% dividend.&quot;   As a hedge against an abrupt market reversal, Mr.Guggenheimer has also suggested that some clients put instop-loss orders. Such orders automatically trigger a stocksale if the price declines to a pre-set level. That mayappeal to some small investors, who &quot;are normally fairlyscared of the market,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
