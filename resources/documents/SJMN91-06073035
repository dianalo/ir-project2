But theTennessee county where the whiskey is made is dry, a situation the distillerand revenue-thirsty county officials want to modify.;    State lawmakers arescheduled to consider today a plea to amend the state liquor law to allowTennessee distillers to sell commemorative bottles of their products at thedistillery.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DRY JACK DANIEL'S COUNTY SEEKS CHANCE TOGO WET  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Moore County, an area of green rolling hills between Nashville andChattanooga, has been dry for more than 100 years.;    Since 1866, the JackDaniel's distillery has helped insulate the rural economy against bad times.Now its product is seen as a way to avoid an increase in property taxes.;   &quot;Our tax base is real small here. We don't have car lots, supermarkets oranything like that to bring in a lot of tax money,&quot; county executive CarlPayne said Monday.;    Executives at Jack Daniel's, the largest employer inthe county of 4,721 people, have agreed to help if the state allows it. Theywill sell commemorative $20 bottles of whiskey at the distillery and givebetween $3.25 and $3.50 a bottle to the consolidated governments of Lynchburgand Moore County.;    Distillery officials estimate that would add about$250,000 a year to the county's $5 million operating budget.;    &quot;That's morethan just the sales tax we'd get off liquor sales,&quot; Payne said.;    Distilleryexecutives say buyers will be asked to sign a statement saying they will notopen the bottle in the county. And the higher price -- a fifth at most liquorstores is $14 -- should encourage buyers to treat the special bottle as acollector's item, with the seal and contents intact.;    The bill to be heardtoday by the Senate's State and Local Government Committee would let localcounty commissions decide whether whiskey could be sold at distilleries, evenin a dry county.;    The distillery would sell commemorative bottles only ifthe question is approved in a referendum, and Jack Daniel's will finance the$8,000 cost of putting the question to a vote.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Lynchburg, Tenn.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910313  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  12A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  340  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday March 13, 199100073035,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
