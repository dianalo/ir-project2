The suspension of production quotas had been expected andwon't significantly change anticipated oil supplies for themonths ahead. The few key OPEC members with substantialexcess capacity had previously indicated they were going touse it with or without formal approval.</LP><TEXT>   But in announcing the move, OPEC signaled itsdetermination to take a bigger role in the current crisisafter weeks of indecision. In an official statement issuedhere, the ministers said they authorized production increasesto &quot;clearly restate to the world that OPEC stands for marketstability and regular supply of oil to consumers.&quot;   OPEC in recent years has attempted to control itsproduction to avoid the gluts, shortages and severe pricegyrations that cost its members enormous amounts of revenueand market share in the 1980s.   Consistent with that strategy, Saudi Arabia and otherleading OPEC members have already begun boosting outputfollowing the price run-up caused by the global embargoagainst Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. The action finally takenyesterday by a majority of the oil ministers sanctions thatoutput surge. The ministers, who have been meeting sinceSunday, reached a tentative accord earlier this week.   Crude-oil prices fell almost $2 a barrel yesterday, withtraders citing the OPEC agreement and a growing perception ofeasing tensions in the Middle East.   Many OPEC ministers here suggested the organization passeda crucial test. There has been some question about OPEC'sability to function during this crisis, which has entangledthree of its five founding members: Iraq, Kuwait and SaudiArabia.   &quot;OPEC has survived the most critical challenge in itshistory,&quot; Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister,said in an interview.   Not all OPEC members were pleased with the outcome,however. Approval came over the objections of the ministersof Iraq and Libya, who boycotted the meeting and questionedits legitimacy. A third opponent, Gholamreza Aghazadeh,Iran's oil minister, did attend but urged that OPEC notincrease output until after major oil-consuming nations havedrawn down their oil inventories to help fill the supply gap.   Mr. Aghazadeh also tried to have yesterday's ministerialmonitoring committee meeting postponed for a week to permitjoint discussions with the Paris-based International EnergyAgency. The IEA represents 21 major oil-consuming nations.The 10 other ministers rejected his proposal. Instead, theycalled on consuming nations to execute existing oil-sharingarrangements designed for shortages and to utilize the&quot;present huge accumulation&quot; of oil inventories.   Despite the OPEC request, a U.S. Energy Departmentspokesman in Washington argued that there is no need yet todraw on strategic reserves. That also will be the U.S.position at tomorrow's IEA governors meeting in Paris.Nevertheless, there are signs that U.S. resistance to dippinginto its reserves is softening. With OPEC sanctioning moreproduction from members that are able to increase output, theU.S. could consider a small release of oil from its reserveto help calm markets.   A majority of OPEC members have been producing at peakcapacity for some time, so despite yesterday's go-ahead, onlya handful can do more. These are expected to make up at leastthree million of the four million barrels a day formerlyexported by Iraq and Kuwait. Saudi Arabia is understood tohold two-thirds, or about two million barrels, of that sparecapacity.   Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, left immediatelyafter yesterday's brief meeting and didn't outline thekingdom's production plans. OPEC sources said, however, thatit is already producing more than seven million barrels aday. Its quota had been 5.4 million barrels a day.   Venezuela also is already producing more. Celestino Armas,oil minister, confirmed output recently was increased 300,000barrels a day. A further 200,000 barrels a day will be addedby the end of the year, he said.   The United Arab Emirates is pushing up output by 500,000barrels a day. And although some of the production claimsseem inflated, lesser amounts are likely to come from someother exporters. Nigeria can produce 250,000 to 280,000barrels a day more, said its oil minister, Jibril Aminu.   Several of the oil ministers suggested that a tabulationof all the increases still leaves OPEC slightly short of itsformer second-half production ceiling -- 22.5 million barrelsa day -- as long as Iraqi and Kuwaiti output is choked down.   Still, Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, Kuwait's finance minister andformer oil minister who represented that country here, saidsupplies should be ample, with oil prices dropping as aresult. &quot;There will be plenty of oil on the market, and thereis definitely no reason for panic,&quot; he said.   ---   Alan Murray and Rose Gutfeld in Washington contributed tothis article.</TEXT></DOC>
