Rear Adm. Anthony A. Less said the survival of the missilefrigate Samuel B. Roberts after it hit an Iranian mine last monthwas ``proof positive that others live, due to the sacrifice of thebrave men on Stark.''   Thirty-seven sailors were killed when two errant Iraqi missileshit the Stark on May 17, 1987.   Less, commander of the U.S. Joint Task Force Middle East, spokeof the Navy's improved shipboard safety measures at a U.S. Embassyceremony honoring the sailors.   Ten crewmen on the Samuel B. Roberts were injured when itcollided with a newly laid mine in the central gulf April 14. Itsskipper, Cmdr. Paul X. Rinn, has said lessons learned from theStark incident enabled his crew to keep their ship from sinking.   Less said the sacrifice of the Stark's crew ``greatly assistedthe United States Navy in being smarter, more combat-ready,especially here in this gulf, and elsewhere throughout the world.''   Among post-Stark safety measures now in effect are proceduresunder which Iraqi warplanes raiding Iranian oil tankers are warnedaway from U.S. ships.   Iran and Iraq both have attacked neutral tankers in the gulf aspart of their 7{-year-old war.   The Iraqi government said the Stark attack was a mistake, andthe United States accepted its apology.   Other ceremonies marking the first anniversary of the Starkattack have been held in recent days at Arlington National Cemeteryin Arlington, Va., Mayport Naval Station in Mayport, Fla., thefrigate's home port, and aboard Navy ships in the gulf.</TEXT></DOC>
