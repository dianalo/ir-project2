STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Short-range nuclear arms could beeliminated from Europe if the United States and Soviet Union agreeon reducing conventional forces, a leading politician in thegoverning coalition said Thursday.   West Germany seeks East-West negotiations on reductions in thebattlefield nuclear weapons, most of which probably would be usedon its territory in case of war, but the United States and Britainare opposed.   Officials in Bonn said West German leaders, who have pressedNATO for a more favorable attitude toward reforms in the Sovietbloc, would discuss superpower relations with Eduard A.Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister.   Shevardnadze met with Secretary of State James A. Baker III inMoscow on Thursday and is to visit Bonn on Friday.   About eliminating short-range weapons, Otto Lambsdorff said in aradio interview: ``This is not possible today, but it could be ifconventional forces in Europe were reduced to levels each siderequires for defense.''   Lambsdorff is chairman of the liberal Free Democratic Party,junior partner in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition.   Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, also a FreeDemocrat, have called for speedy East-West negotiations to reduceshort-range weapons. The United States and Britain say the weaponsare an essential part of the Western alliance's efense strategy.   Genscher flew to London on Thursday for more talks on the matterwith British counterpart, Sir Geoffrey Howe.   In a meeting two weeks ago, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wasunable to convince Kohl to drop his demand for negotiations, whichhas split the alliance just before a NATO summit scheduled forBrussels later in May.   In Moscow, Baker rejected a proposal by President Mikhail S.Gorbachev that the superpowers negotiate reductions in theshort-range weapons.   NATO has 88 Lance missile launchers, most of them based in WestGermany. The missiles now have a range of 75 miles, butmodernization would increase that to about 250.   Shevardnadze is expected to address many topics during his visitto Bonn, including disarmament and relations between the twocountries. He will meet with both Kohl and Genscher.   Before meeting with Shevardnadze, Genscher will see Baker at ameeting of NATO officials Friday in Brussels.   A federal government source said: ``We expect Shevardnadze willbe reporting on the current state of Soviet-American relations.This area is very important and interesting for us.''   In remarks to Parliament on April 27, Kohl said the West``should support reform processes in all Warsaw Pact countries. Iurge our European and American friends to help carry out thispolicy and agree on a common approach.''</TEXT></DOC>
