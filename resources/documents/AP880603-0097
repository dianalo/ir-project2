It was not immediately known if Mehdi Bazargan, author of theletter and head of the tiny Freedom Movement, Iran's only legalopposition group, was among those in jail.   In the letter, Bazargan accused Khomeini of following an``erroneous policy'' in the war with Iraq, isolating Iran andmaking it a symbol of hate around the world. Excerpts from theletter were printed in today's edition of Le Monde newspaper.   An Iranian exile source in Paris, who obtained a copy of theletter, said Thursday it was 33 pages long and distributed innumerous Iranian cities about 10 days ago.   Another, shorter letter by a group sympathizing with Bazarganalso was distributed in Iran, the source said, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   The letters and the subsequent arrests came on the heels ofseveral major Iranian defeats in its war with Iraq. In mid-April,Iraq recaptured the Faw Peninsula from Iran. In late May, Iran lostits bridgehead in the southern Iraqi port city of Basra followingan Iraqi assault.   Bazargan also denounced aid allegedly furnished by Iran toterrorist groups such as the Islamic Jihad, which claims to beholding Western hostages in Lebanon.   ``In truth, for seven years Iran and Islam have becomesynonymous in the world with hate and malice,'' Le Monde quoted theletter as saying. ``It is a shame and not an honor.''   ``When are you going to stop making commerce with the blood ofour martyrs?''   Bazargan, an opposition politician under former Shah MohammedReza Pahlavi, was appointed prime minister shortly after Khomeini'sreturn from exile. He stepped down in mid-November 1979, objectingto Khomeini's support for the detention of American hostages.Bazargan also served in the nation's parliament.   Le Monde said it appeared that several dozen people werearrested in Tehran, the Iranian capital, and provincial cities suchas Tabriz, in Azerbaijan, and Isfahan, south of the capital.   Among those arrested, Le Monde said, were Ali Ardalan, formerfinance minister; and Husseini Shah Hussein, who was president ofthe welcome committee when the exiled Khomeini returned to Iran in1980.   Police forces this week occupied the Tehran headquarters of theFreedom Movement, making more arrests, according to Le Monde, whichdid not give sources for the report. It said they were apparentlysearching for Bazargan but did not say whether he was among thosearrested.   ``Yesterday at 2 a.m., they went to his place, but we don't knowyet if he was arrested or not,'' said Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, exiledfirst president of the post-Shah Islamic Republic, in a telephoneinterview on Thursday. Bani-Sadr now lives outside Paris.   In the letter, Le Monde quoted Bazargan as saying that none ofIran's war goals had been achieved and that Iraqi President SaddamHussein, whom Iran has vowed to topple, remains in place.   ``You have, besides, proclaimed the continuation of the waruntil the destruction of Israel, but you have arrived at a policyof compromise and collaboration with Israel,'' an apparentreference to the Iran-Contra imbroglio in which Israel reportedlyacted as a conduit for U.S. arms sales to Iran.   ``You have denounced the policies of the United States and nowthe latter are solidly installed at our door in the Persian Gulf.You spoke of the failure of Iraq and the bursting of its regime,but with your erroneous policy, Iraq has reinforced itself ... andit is we who are on the edge of bankruptcy.''   Bazargan has in the past called for an end to the Iran-Iraq war,now in its eighth year, but observers described the letter as hisstrongest such protest.   For the first time, he denounced alleged Iranian ties toterrorist groups. Naming the Islamic Jihad, he wrote that ``by itsterrorist action, it has filled the world with hate toward ourcountry.   ``You have thus isolated the Islamic Republic, and the youth whomade our revolution are today traumatized, repressed anddesperate.''   On Thursday, Khomeini appointed Parliament Speaker HashemiRafsanjani acting commander-in-chief of Iran's armed forces, Iran'sofficial media reported.   Bani-Sadr said Rafsanjani was appointed because the Iraniangoverment fears it may lose the war.</TEXT></DOC>
