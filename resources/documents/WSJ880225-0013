Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FIN WNEWS </CO><TEXT>   Financial Corp. of America, parent of a deeply troubled major thrift, said one of its directors resigned abruptly because he disagreed with an order by federal regulators to trim the company's mortgage-backed securities portfolio by $2.5 billion.    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. said J. Ralph Stone, 74 years old, resigned on Feb. 11 as a director of the company and its American Savings andamp; Loan Association unit. Financial Corp. didn't say why it delayed the announcement of Mr. Stone's resignation.    In the SEC filing, Financial Corp. said Mr. Stone's resignation followed an order on Feb. 4 by regulators that the company reduce its mortgage-backed securities portfolio by $2.5 billion, or about 14%, and use the proceeds to pay down its $14 billion in short-term secured loans from Wall Street firms.    &quot;Mr. Stone disagreed with acceding to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's directive and resigned for this reason,&quot; Financial Corp. said in the SEC filing. &quot;He did not submit a letter of resignation.&quot; The company said it doesn't intend to fill Mr. Stone's posts immediately.    Mr. Stone couldn't be reached for comment last night.    He was named a director of Financial Corp. in 1984, when the Bank Board ousted former Chairman Charles W. Knapp and chose William J. Popejoy, a veteran California thrift executive, as his successor.    Mr. Stone's resignation is another sign of the increasingly tense relationship between Financial Corp. and the Bank Board.    Mr. Popejoy and Financial Corp. had enjoyed relatively good relations with former Bank Board Chairman Edwin J. Gray, who had picked Mr. Popejoy to run the company.    Mr. Gray also approved Mr. Popejoy's strategy of trying to generate operating income by boosting the size of the company's mortgage-backed securities portfolio. The strategy was criticized by some thrift executives and consultants, however, because it increased the potential losses to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. if the company had to be bailed out while interest rates were rising. Rising rates depress the value of mortgage-backed securities, which generally pay fixed interest rates.    In recent weeks, Mr. Gray's successor, M. Danny Wall, and fellow Bank Board member Roger Martin, have repudiated the growth strategy by ordering the portfolio reduction. Since the Feb. 4 order, Financial Corp. has sold about $1.6 billion of mortgage-backed securities. The company's mortgage-backed securities portfolio was valued at $18.24 billion as of Dec. 31.    The sales reduce the risk to the FSLIC, but will reduce Financial Corp.'s revenue. Mr. Popejoy has said he disagrees with the Bank Board's order to reduce the portfolio. He declined to comment last night on whether other directors are considering resigning. </TEXT></DOC>
