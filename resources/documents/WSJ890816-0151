The original bid, rejected by Dunkin' Donuts directors, was to expire yesterday but was extended to Sept. 15.    The Canadian bidders also modified the terms of their $43-a-share offer, making it conditional on 50.1% of Dunkin' Donuts' common shares being tendered on a fully diluted basis. The offer was subject to 75% of the shares being tendered. The revised offer is also conditional on redemption by the Dunkin' Donuts board of poison-pill share purchase rights.    Unicorp and Cara said they plan to file a suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery asking that the Dunkin' Donuts board redeem preferred shares issued to General Electric Capital Corp. and the poison-pill rights. The companies also are seeking to overturn the doughnut chain's employee stock ownership plan.    &quot;We're sweetening the bid because obviously the company is worth more to us if we're successful in court,&quot; said Eric Evans, vice-president of Unicorp.    Richard N. Hart, Jr., vice president-treasurer of Randolph, Mass.-based Dunkin' Donuts said, &quot;There will be no comment until we've actually read the filing.&quot; He also said the board would meet with Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. to study the value of a $45-a-share bid.    Unicorp and Cara said that a Unicorp unit, Kingsbridge Capital Group, already holds about 15% of Dunkin' Donuts stock and that shareholders have tendered an additional 25%.    &quot;We're already on the threshold of that 50.1%,&quot; said Mr. Evans. &quot;Clearly, we're prepared to sit there and buy voting control, even if it doesn't give us real control for a while&quot; because of the staggered terms of Dunkin' Donuts' board members.    Unicorp and Cara argue that if their bid is unsuccessful, the price of Dunkin' Donuts stock will drop to around $28 or $30, its trading range before takeover bid rumors began to circulate.    In national over-the-counter trading, Dunkin' Donuts closed yesterday at $37.875 a share, up 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
