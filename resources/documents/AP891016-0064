A voluntary evacuation order for thousands of people in thelow-lying southwestern corner of Louisiana was lifted today as theremnants of the late-season storm moved away to the north througheastern Texas.   By 5 a.m. the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression withwinds at 35 mph. It was centered was 35 miles east-southeast ofLufkin, near 31.2 degrees north latitude and 94.2 degrees westlongitude. It was moving northeast at 17 mph and was expected tocontinue in that direction and weaken further.   As the hurricane blew into Galveston from the Gulf of Mexico, ituprooted trees, smashed windows and tore several balconies from anapartment building. ``Whole balconies came down. It just rippedthem up from the bolts,'' said resident John Harsh.   But damage overall was limited, with City Manager Doug Matthewssaying today that it is estimated to be less than $10 million. Hesaid also that there was no looting.   The bodies of a 24-year-old man, who worked for the U.S. CoastGuard, and his 2-year-old daughter were found on rock jetties onGalveston Island's protective seawall, Galveston police said. Itappeared that they had been in a car that was swept off theseawall, officers said.   The seawall was erected after Galveston was devastated in a 1900hurricane in which 6,000 or more people died. It was the deadliesthurricane on record in the United States.   A tornado spun off by Jerry damaged several buildings in thetown of Orange near the Louisiana line, and another twister rippedthe door off a Galveston fire truck and damaged the fire stationand a shed at the airport.   Tornadoes or funnel clouds were sighted around Galveston Bay inHitchcock, Baytown, Beach City, Webster and a nearby spot northeastof Texas Highway 6. Tornado damage generally was confined to roofsand power lines.   Two tornadoes were spotted early today in inland Polk County,damaging some houses and barns, said sheriff's spokeswoman GenaceChapman.   At least 52,000 homes and businesses lost power, most of them inGalveston Island, said Houston Lighting andamp; Power spokeswoman GrahamPainter. But by 5 a.m. today, 80 percent of the power was restored.Phone service to much of the island also was disrupted.   The center of the hurricane made landfall Sunday evening, withsustained winds of 80 mph and 100 mph gusts, according to theNational Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla. Within 3{ hours,Jerry was downgraded to a tropical storm after its maximumsustained winds fell below 74 mph.   On Galveston, which bore the brunt of the storm, an earlyassessment found minor street flooding but little serious damage,said Gary Vasquez of the emergency operations center. The biggesttask appeared to be cleaning up debris scattered by the wind, hesaid.   ``I think we did very well,'' said Mayor Jan Coggeshall.   Schools were open as usual today, except for one elementaryschool closed because of a power outage.   Jerry was considered a category 1 hurricane, the least severepossible. Hurricane Hugo, which devastated parts of the Caribbeanand South Carolina last month, was a category 4 with winds of 135mph. Jerry was much smaller, too, with hurricane-force windsextending just 15 to 25 miles out from the eye, as compared with100 miles for Hugo.   But Jerry was still enough to cause fear in low-lying areas,particularly because it coincided with an unusually high tidecaused by a rare alignment of the Earth, moon and sun. Thecombination of astronomical forces and the storm sent tides 5 to 8feet above normal.   In Louisiana's Cameron Parish, officials Sunday urged voluntaryevacuation of 8,000 to 10,000 residents. ``We're just concernedabout getting people to higher ground,'' said Scott Henry, a CivilDefense volunteer.   The evacuation advisory was lifted this morning.   Earlier, hundreds of workers had been evacuated from offshoreoil rigs as Jerry zigzagged through the gulf during the weekend.   Most of Galveston's 62,000 residents decided to stay in theirhomes instead of evacuating for Jerry.   By 11 p.m., those who had moved to shelters were told they couldreturn home, said Gary Stone, spokesman for Galveston's EmergencyOperations Center.   Jerry was the seventh hurricane of the six-month Atlanticseason, which ends in November. Hugo was easily the mostdestructive, killing 33 people in the Caribbean and 29 on the U.S.mainland and causing billions of dollars in damage.</TEXT></DOC>
