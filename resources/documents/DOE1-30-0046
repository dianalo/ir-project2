For a model districtat the inland water area, an estimate was made for the systeme with capacityof 20 KW, 200 KW and 1,000 KW respectively. Estimated power output ofAC by inverter was 23.3 MWH, 253.9 MWH, and 1,315 MWH per year respectively.Concerning the solar cell module located on the sea, its structure andmaterial must be carefully examined for preventing the damage from thewaves and the sea-salt. Hanging type of power transmission was foundmore appropriate than the submerged type transmission. DC power transmissionwas found more ecanomical than AC transmission especially in the highercapacity region than 20 KW. Reduction of cost was aimed for the floatingbody mooring system by utilizing ready-made steel pipes.</TEXT></DOC>
