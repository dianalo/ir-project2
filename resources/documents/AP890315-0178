PeacekeepingPlan</HEAD><BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Officials of five Central American nationsWednesday endorsed a plan to send U.N. peacekeepers to the region toensure guerrillas don't launch cross-border raids.   The plan, which needs U.N. approval, calls for up to 100 militaryobservers to monitor Central American border areas in speedboats,helicopters and all-terrain vehicles.   ``We approved the document in the sense that we discussed thedocument, and there are no disagreements,'' Nicaragua's deputyforeign minister, Victor Hugo Tinoco, said after talks with militaryofficers and foreign ministry officials from El Salvador, Honduras,Costa Rica and Guatemala.   The head of the Honduran delegation, Ambassador Roberto FloresBermudez, confirmed the agreement in principle had been reached.   Up to 11,000 Contra rebels have bases in Honduras from which theylaunch raids into Nicaragua. They are the prime focus of thepeacekeeping plan.   In addition, El Salvador says leftist insurgents trying tooverthrow the El Salvadoran government operate from clandestinebases in Honduras without that government's permission.   The peacekeepers will also monitor the Costa Rica-Nicaraguaborder and will use speedboats to patrol the Gulf of Fonseca, whichlinks Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador on their Pacific coasts,according to a copy of the U.N. draft plan.   The U.N. plan says they will need all-terrain vehicles,helicopters and a light airplane, as well as at least one speedboat.   The foreign ministers of the five nations will ask the UnitedNations to begin setting up the peacekeeping force, a step Tinococalled ``a formality.''   In February, the foreign ministers agreed in principle that U.N.military observers should operate in the region to verify reports ofguerrilla activity and, by their presence, deter such raids.   The United Nations then drafted a plan calling for up to 100military observers backed by 60 pilots, drivers and civilianadministrators from Canada, Spain and West Germany.   A U.N. diplomat said the plan will not conflict with U.S.intentions to keep the Contras active by providing non-lethal aid.   The current Congressional six-month appropriation of $27.1million for the Contras expires at the end of March, and the Bushadministration is hoping to renew it.   ``It does not pre-empt the humanitarian aid for the Contras; itdoes give the United States the breathing space they want'' for therebels, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   The foreign ministers are to meet March 29-20 in San Jose, CostaRica, to take the next step on the peacekeeping plan and discussother Central American issues.</TEXT></DOC>
