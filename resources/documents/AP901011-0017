A good cup of joe, ortwo, or three, won't hurt the heart, Harvard researchers reportedtoday.   In fact, coffee with caffeine, the often maligned chemical thatgives the brew its kick, may turn out to be easier on the heartthan the decaffeinated variety.   ``It's amazing how coffee has a bad name, when the harder onelooks at health hazards, the more difficult it is to find adverseeffects,'' says Dr. Walter Willett of the Harvard School of PublicHealth.   His research, part of a huge study of healthy people, shows thatthose who drink several cups of ordinary caffeinated coffee everyday do not raise their risk of heart attacks.   ``This is a very reassuring study for something that peopleenjoy day in and day out,'' said Dr. Harvey Wolinsky of Mt. SinaiHospital in New York, an adviser to the National CoffeeAssociation.   The research was based on a survey of the coffee-drinking habitso 45,589 men. It was published in today's New England Journal ofMedicine.   Those who suspected coffee was bad for the heart usually assumedcaffeine was to blame. But the new research suggests just theopposite: Those who drink more than four cups of decaf a day haveabout a 60 percent higher risk of heart disease than do those whonever drink it.   The researchers cautioned that the link between decaf and hearttrouble is statistically weak and it's too soon to conclude decafis harmful.   ``There is no particular reason to switch from caffeinated todecaffeinated coffee from the point of view of preventing heartdisease,'' he said.   Another recent study also raised doubts about decaffeinatedcoffee. Researchers at Stanford University found that people whoswitch from regular coffee to decaf increased their levels oflow-density lipoprotein - the so-called bad cholesterol - anaverage of 7 percent.   No one knows why decaffeinated coffee might do this. Somespeculate it could result from differences in the type of beansused to make decaf or in the way they are processed.   Caffeine might trigger heart palpitations in some people, butDr. Peter Wilson of the Framingham Heart Study said there is nogood proof of this either.   ``The Marcus Welby theories are reasonable, but there isn't alot of proof to back them up - that you should be drinking decafbecause it's better for your heart,'' Wilson said. Robert Young,who played Dr. Welby in a TV series, made commercials for a brandof decaffeinated coffee.   Wilson added that if people believe they have fewer palpitationsby switching, ``it's very reasonable, and they shouldn't toss thedecaf down the sink.''   While the wisdom of very high coffee consumption isquestionable, several experts agreed that three or four cups a dayof typical American coffee are safe for virtually everybody, eventhose with heart disease.   Participants in the Harvard study, all doctors, dentists andother health professionals, filled out questionnaires about theircoffee habits. After two years, 221 of them had suffered heartattacks or died of heart disease, while 136 had undergone coronarybypass surgery or angioplasty.   The risk among those who drank four or more cups of all kinds ofcoffee or just caffeinated coffee was about the same as fornon-users.   ``This study means that if there is a hazard with drinkingcaffeinated coffee, it's going to be very small, and there may benone at all,'' said Willett.</TEXT></DOC>
