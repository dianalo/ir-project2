The first goal was accomplished Tuesday, when the Soviet leadermet a smiling Deng Xiaoping, China's supreme leader, to normalizestate and party relations after 30 years of hostility.   ``A long period of mutual alienation is now behind us,''Gorbachev said later in a speech.   But the breathtaking scene of 1 million Chinese in the streetsclamoring for democratic reforms added an unexpected dimension tothe first meeting of Chinese and Soviet leaders in three decades.   More than disrupt the summit schedule, the protests appeared toelicit an empathy among leaders determined to carry out reform butbeset by critical social problems.   Gorbachev, while refusing to take sides in China's internalproblems, consoled the Chinese by noting the turmoil he faces fromunrest among various ethnic groups.   The Soviet leader reasoned that disturbances did not represent acrisis for socialism but were a natural consequence of the reformsundertaken by both China and the Soviet Unionn.   ``Glasnost and the pluralism of views have laid bare problemswhich were piling up for decades without solution. Popularaspirations often run ahead of the reforms,'' he said.   ``Without democratizing the economy,'' Gorbachev said,``perestroika (economic reforms) will never succeed.''   The Chinese seemed of similar opinion. Premier Li Peng, in wordspartially meant for domestic consumption, said China will improveits record on freedom, democracy and human rights.   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, the father of China's decade-oldmarket-oriented economic reforms, agreed with Gorbachev that thetheories of Karl Marx belong to the 19th century and are not alwaysapplicable today.   The two sides also made it clear that democratic reforms do notmean multiparty rule. If the party is properly supervised,Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang said, ``I believethat the Chinese citizens can enjoy genuine democracy and freedom''under one-party rule.   ``To take into account and harmonize the various interests'' ofthe people under one party, Gorbachev added at a news conference,``we need democracy and glasnost.''   Gorbachev and the Chinese were in somewhat less accord about themeaning of ``normalization.'' Gorbachev spoke in glowing termsabout the potentials for trade, cultural and technical exchangesand close consultations on international affairs.   He envisioned an ideal world in which the 4,300-mile Sino-Sovietboundary, heavily militarized since the outbreak of fighting in1969, becomes a ``border of peace and good-neighborliness'' withall troops removed.   Gorbachev also said the Soviet Union, having opened the door toChina, hopes to become an integral member of the Asian community.He again promoted the concept of a collective security arrangementamong Asians and stressed that ``this is the region where the fateof our civilization will be played out.''   The Chinese were generally less positive, emphasizing they willnever return to the relationship of the 1950s when Beijing wassubservient to Moscow and repeating that normal ties will notaffect relations with other countries _ namely the United States.   Disagreement continued over Cambodia, where Moscow-backedVietnamese troops backing the government are to end their 10-yearoccupation by the end of September and where Beijing-supportedKhmer Rouge rebels are fighting for control.   The issue took up the most space in the summit's jointcommunique. China reiterated its call for a coalition governmentheaded by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, a moderate backed by Washington,while the Soviets said only that the civil war should be settled byCambodians.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Jim Abrams has been Beijing bureau chief for TheAssociated Press for three years.</TEXT></DOC>
