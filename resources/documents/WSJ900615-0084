Scarsdale school kids were delighted to haveclassmates from an exotic and faraway land.   But as the number of Japanese increased, the atmosphere ofcomity began to change. Today, 17% of Scarsdale High'sstudents are Japanese, and resulting problems have led theschool to form a &quot;prejudice reduction committee.&quot;   The Japanese students now socialize mainly with eachother, make fewer American friends, learn less English andlock themselves into a self-reinforcing segregation. TheAmerican students complain that the Japanese ruin themathematics grading curve, and they seem to view the Japaneseas an alien and somewhat threatening force.   &quot;There's always this feeling: I don't know what they'retalking about,&quot; says Torie Sewell, a 15-year-old sophomore.&quot;Maybe they're talking about me. Maybe they're saying theyhate Americans.&quot;   As the U.S. and Japan move into an era of shared worldleadership, the young people in both countries will beleading the way. In some respects, they offer great hope.They are free from the scars of World War II that distortedrelations between their parents and they share the greatglobal pulse of popular culture.   Yet while the world is shrinking under the influence ofsatellite television, jumbo jets and fax machines, visitswith dozens of young people in both countries suggest thatthe chasm between the two cultures is as wide as ever --maybe wider.   Many young Americans share their parents' concerns abouttheir nation's status in the world, but aren't alwaysinspired to do much about it. Japanese young people,meanwhile, seem more overtly nationalistic than their elders,and more resentful of the U.S. and what they see as itsbullying ways.   Even Shintaro Ishihara, the Diet member whoseanti-American statements have made him the current &quot;betenoir&quot; of U.S.-Japan relations, is surprised by Japanese youngpeople. &quot;Japanese teen-agers,&quot; he warns, &quot;are much moredangerous than me.&quot; Kenichi Takemura, a popular Japanesetelevision commentator, observes: &quot;The youngsters have notexperienced the bombing by B-29s. The war does not live intheir minds. So they get the idea Japan can be arrogant.&quot;   A surprising sign of changing attitudes among Japan'syounger generation can be seen in a Wall Street Journal pollin Japan that asked: &quot;In the unlikely event your country wereto go to war in the future, which country do you think wouldbe the most likely opponent.&quot; Just over 10% of respondentsover the age of 50 said the U.S. However, that figure rose to25% for respondents under the age of 30.   ---   Housed in a sprawling old brick building, Scarsdale HighSchool might seem insulated from the economic concerns of theoutside world. But its students are clearly attuned to theshifting fortunes of the U.S. and Japan. American studentsmake quips in the hallways about Japanese imperialism. Andmany students here, Japanese and American, feel Japan hasalready surpassed the U.S. in economic power.   &quot;It will be said in a gibing tone -- `Oh, the Japanese aretaking over America,'&quot; says Ms. Sewell, an outgoing youngwoman with straight blond hair. &quot;But you can also see theseriousness in it.&quot;   &quot;The Japanese are so obvious in what they have,&quot; saysChris Lopez, a junior. &quot;You see Japanese cars all over theworld. People feel resentment. We're Americans. We'resupposed to have everything. And when they stay off bythemselves, people say, `They think they're better.'&quot;   Such resentment seldom surfaces in blatant acts ofdiscrimination, but it sets a subtle tone for relationsbetween the two groups. &quot;It's difficult for the Americans tofigure out what the Japanese are thinking,&quot; says BrianFisher, a senior at the school. &quot;They really isolatethemselves.&quot; Mr. Lopez says the general attitude of hisfriends is that Japanese students &quot;aren't fun. They're noteasy to get to know.&quot;   For their part, the Japanese complain of a subtleprejudice. &quot;I'm trying not to think it's because of racism,&quot;says Takuma Hayashi, a senior who has lived in the U.S. sincefifth grade. &quot;I'm trying to think it's lack ofcommunication.&quot;   &quot;It's really a lack of our efforts and a lack of theirconsideration toward our problems,&quot; says Yuki Yamabe, anotherScarsdale High student.   Many of the Japanese students, especially the girls, arealso under pressure from home to steer clear of Americanways. &quot;The girls' parents don't want them to becomeAmericanized,&quot; says Kaori Aoyama, whose father was evenunhappy that she got her ears pierced. &quot;Most of the girls'parents are worried about sex. They want us to be Japaneseladies. They never say, `Don't associate with Americanstudents,' but they do always remind us: `You are Japanese.'&quot;   In some ways, the nature of American education bafflesJapanese students. In social studies classes, they are calledon to express and defend opinions, something that seldomhappens in Japanese schools. In science, says Naomi Morii,who has a son in the 10th grade, &quot;they do lots ofinvestigation, go to the zoo, do experiments. In Japan, theteacher gives information, and you study and memorize.&quot;   Homework takes much longer for the Japanese because theyhave to look up so many English words. And on top of theirregular studies, most also attend some sort of after-schoolJapanese program to prepare for Japan's rigorouscollege-entrance exams.   Their reaction to these conflicting demands is to redoubletheir efforts. As a result, their teachers say, many Japaneseshow up bleary-eyed and groggy from studying late into thenight.   &quot;All the American teachers say, `Don't work so hard. Stopafter two hours. You're going to break your health,'&quot; saysMs. Yamabe. &quot;But if we don't work hard, we won't get thegrade and won't get into college. If I stop after two hours,there's nothing on the paper.&quot;   These study habits reinforce their isolation. &quot;I tried tomake American friends, and I did, but the life is sodifferent,&quot; says Ms. Yamabe. &quot;After school, they can play. Ifthey ask me to stay over at their house, I can't because Ihave homework. And so I started to lose my American friends.&quot;   That hard work is yet another source of irritation amongthe American students, who aren't willing to quit thefootball team or the debating team to put in the extra hourson studies. And when it comes to mathematics, the Americansfigure even extra hours wouldn't be enough. The Japanesestudents come to Scarsdale with a much more intense mathbackground. &quot;They seem on such a higher plateau in math,&quot;says Ms. Sewell. &quot;It's like, they're so much better, why evenbother?&quot;   &quot;There's a kid in my class who literally sleeps throughclass -- and he gets A's,&quot; chimes in Mr. Lopez.   This defeatism seems to be reflected in the students'views on broader issues, like American competitiveness. &quot;I'mnot willing to make the sacrifice that it would take to beNo. 1,&quot; says Mr. Lopez. &quot;Working long hours without pay,sacrificing yourself for your country -- that's not worthit.&quot;   &quot;A lot of people feel that way,&quot; says Ms. Sewell. &quot;Butthey still don't like it when the people that are beating usare right next door.&quot;   ---   Unlike American culture, with its celebration of therugged individualist, the Japanese ethic has emphasizedsuppression of individual desires for the good of the group,the company, the nation. These days, though, &quot;kojinshugi&quot; --individualism -- is a word heard more and more, and almostalways in reference to younger people, such as Hiroya Kanda.   On a rainy Saturday afternoon, he sits with two friends ina stylish coffee shop in downtown Tokyo. The three aredressed for tennis.   &quot;Younger people are really different from the oldergeneration,&quot; says Mr. Kanda, a 29-year-old manager at theLongTerm Credit Bank of Japan. Until a few years ago,Saturday was a workday at the bank, and Sunday the only dayoff. Now, while Mr. Kanda still works as late as 7 or 8 p.m.during the week, his Saturdays and Sundays are free. Thenature of that free time has changed too. His elders mightspend their leisure time playing golf with colleagues orbusiness partners, but Mr. Kanda says he avoids golf becauseit reminds him too much of work. His preference: tennis ortouring the countryside.   Unlike many older Japanese, who take an &quot;it can't behelped&quot; attitude toward Japan's cramped standard of living,Mr. Kanda fantasizes about a better life. &quot;I think Americansare much richer than Japanese,&quot; he says. &quot;They live in largerhouses with pools, tennis courts. Here the companies and thecountry may be rich, but the people are poor.&quot; The oldergeneration may have worked for the company or the country,but Mr. Kanda has a different idea. &quot;I work for myself,&quot; hesays.   His views aren't unusual in today's Japan, where youngpeople are striving for more freedom. Yukio Okamoto, adivision director at Japan's foreign ministry, tells a storyof one of his young staffers who recently declined aninvitation to go drinking with his boss because &quot;he had plansto go listen to a new CD with his wife. In my days,&quot; Mr.Okamoto says, &quot;an invitation from a director was a godsend.You would never turn it down.&quot;   Still, the pull of tradition can't be underestimated.Japanese young people still work longer hours than theirAmerican counterparts. Most still expect to be with the samecompany all their working lives, unable to switch jobs evenif they feel mistreated. And the late trains that leave Tokyoeach evening are still packed full of young men, who spentthe evening on the town with their colleagues rather than athome with their families.   &quot;The young are changing, but as they go up into thecorporate hierarchy they get assimilated,&quot; says MasahikoIshizuka, an editorial writer for the Nihon Keizai Shimbun.&quot;The grip of Japan's corporate life style is unexpectedlystrong.&quot;   And even Mr. Kanda, for all his Western sentiments, seesmuch about the West he doesn't like. &quot;The ratio of lazypersons is much higher in the U.S,&quot; he says. Moreover, &quot;Wehave a longer history than the U.S.A. We should be proud ofour own culture. We must export our culture.&quot;   The paradox of today's young Japanese is that the samekids who eat up American pop culture -- from McDonalds'hamburgers to the Billboard Top 40 -- want the world torecognize the greatness of their own country's culture. Ifthey are more and more like Americans, that doesn't mean theynecessarily like Americans.   The older generation was reared in the immediate post-waryears, still bearing the shame of the war and grateful forU.S. generosity during and immediately after the occupation;the younger generation, in contrast, seems prouder of Japan'saccomplishments -- and more resentful of what they see asAmerican hectoring. This sense of national pride bordering onchauvinism is readily apparent in an evening of eating anddrinking with members of Kyoto University's judo club.   &quot;We're too subservient to Americans,&quot; says Atsuhiro Noda,a 21-year-old engineering student. &quot;If there's a massacre inPoland, Japan would be very eager to criticize. But if it'sdone by the U.S., Japan would hesitate to criticize. Japanshould have its own stance. Japan should be standing on anequal footing.&quot;   Masafumi Okuda, the team's 22-year-old captain, agrees. &quot;Ithink Japan should have its own military capacity,&quot; he says.&quot;It's abnormal to rely on the U.S.&quot; Mr. Okuda thinks theAmerican troops based in Japan &quot;should be allowed to gohome.&quot;   To be sure, such feelings aren't unanimous within thegroup. Koji Kawakami, a 19-year-old sophomore, worries thatwith Japan &quot;behaving like a `nouveau riche'&quot; on the worldstage, the U.S. and others will abandon it to isolation. &quot;I'mnot accepting a subservient attitude, but the world situationdoesn't allow a {Japanese} military buildup,&quot; he says. Butmost of them think their country should occupy a place in theworld as a strong nation, independent of American influence.   Their attitude is evident even in the sport they havechosen. Judo requires three grueling hours a day of training,and those who choose it do so, in part, out of a loyalty tothe traditional Japanese notion that effort is good for itsown sake. Mr. Okuda has a cauliflower ear that is testimonyto the sport's rigors; it's a badge of honor for judo expertsthat comes from constantly rubbing against rough floor matsduring matches.   Not surprisingly, Mr. Noda doesn't have much regard forAmerican athletes. &quot;Americans are much bigger, so they resortto power rather than skill,&quot; he says. But judo, he suggestswith satisfaction, is a sport where power doesn't count formuch and skill is everything.   If these judo team members represent the traditionalism intoday's young Japanese, many young women represent change.Women suffer the most from their country's rigid social andbusiness structure, and over breakfast at Tokyo's PalaceHotel, four young career women freely talk about theirfrustrations.   The four currently work for Grey Daiko Advertising Inc.,an American-affiliated firm in Tokyo. They like the companybecause, ironically, it offers them better opportunities thanthey would find in a Japanese firm. Yasuko Furuichi, a28-year-old account executive, supposes that some Japanesecompanies may be open to women. But she joined a foreign firmbecause &quot;I want to play it safe. I have talked to women inJapanese companies, and I'm sure I can't survive there.&quot;   Toshiko Tsuchiya, a 29-year-old account executive,desribes how she once worked for a Japanese travel company.For three weeks a month, she led tours, doing the same workas men her age. But during the one week each month the tourguides spent in the office, she and the other women had towear uniforms and serve tea.   Family pressures are intense as well. Mayumi Honda grew upin the conservative town of Hamamatsu. Her father doesn'tlike her working, and her family is concerned that at the&quot;old&quot; age of 25, she remains single. &quot;They wanted to have anarranged marriage for me,&quot; she says. &quot;Older people thinkthat's good.&quot;   Perhaps because of their own frustrations, these youngwomen are generally sympathetic toward the U.S. in itssometimes prickly relations with their country. &quot;Sometimes Iwish the U.S. would speak louder&quot; in making trade demands,says Ms. Furuichi. &quot;The Japanese government won't changeinternally. The only way to change is through outsidepressure.&quot;   But they see little hope their society will address thethings that matter most to them, such as the country'scrowded living conditions. &quot;The source of the problem is thatJapanese people are trained not to fight against theestablishment,&quot; says Kiyoko Tsujita, a 25-year-oldcopywriter.   If anyone understands the difficulty of meshing Japaneseand American culture, and how that may affect Japan's role inthe world, it is Arseny Besher, a colleague of the women atGrey-Daiko.   Mr. Besher is the product of both worlds. Sandy-haired andunquestionably Caucasian, he nonetheless is a native-bornJapanese. His parents were the children of Russian emigresliving in Shanghai, who fled to Japan after the Communiststook over. Mr. Besher was born in 1962 in Kobe, making him anofficial Japanese citizen under an obscure law coveringpeople born of stateless parents.   While he is a Japanese citizen, no one in Japan -- excepthis childhood nanny -- has ever treated him as a native. On arecent trip to Thailand, the customs officer at Bangkokairport asked Mr. Besher why he had a Japanese passport.   &quot;Because I'm Japanese,&quot; he replied.   The customs officer thought for a second and then askedwhy Mr. Besher was Japanese.   &quot;Because I have a Japanese passport,&quot; he replied.   Mr. Besher thrived in his Japanese grade school, but highschool at a prestigious San Francisco institution was more ofa problem. He arrived speaking only Russian and Japanese, andhe disliked the teachers, whose goal as he saw it wasn't toeducate but to get their students into big-name colleges. Mr.Besher instead chose St. John's, a small &quot;Great Books&quot;college with campuses in Annapolis, Md., and Santa Fe, N.M.In the end, however, he still felt &quot;more alienated inAmerica,&quot; and returned to Japan after graduation.   Yet Mr. Besher wonders what a world under Japaneseleadership might be like. While Japanese profess allegianceto democratic values, he wonders just how deep those beliefsgo. In Japan, he says, the appearance of having a certainattitude can be as important as the attitude itself: &quot;Do youappear friendly? Do you appear intelligent? Do you appeardemocratic? But you don't hear people say someone is reallyintelligent. Or really democratic. That's private. There areaspects of their beliefs they don't choose to share.&quot;   He believes the government tries to discourage youngpeople from thinking for themselves. The education ministry,he contends, has made clear for 20 years that it wantsschools to turn out people who can &quot;solve problems&quot; but whowon't &quot;seek answers&quot; -- people who can use math andlinguistics to &quot;contribute to Japan through industry,&quot; not asvoters and citizens. Japanese bureaucrats and politicians, heclaims, &quot;want no part of a society where they have to listento the masses.&quot;   Mr. Besher says it isn't clear that those bureaucrats andpoliticians want a leadership role in the world. But that,too, could be a matter of appearances. &quot;They don't have tocontrol the wheel,&quot; he says. &quot;But they want to own it.&quot;   ---           Young and Old Differ On Threat to Japan                                                                                                        Japanese responses to the question: In the unlikely eventyour country were to go to war in the future, which countrydo you think would be the most likely opponent?
