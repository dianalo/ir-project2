He extolls the British system of cabinet government and rebukes our bicentennial celebration &quot;of a manifestly obsolete document.&quot;    There is no inherent reason why the arrangements of 1787 cannot be modified now. It is, however, not at all manifest that the British system has been better for Britain than the U.S. structure has been for America, and it is highly unlikely that the British arrangements would work here. The British generally have chosen leaders from a narrow social class while the American system offers opportunity to a wider and more diverse population. We do things differently, not worse.    The American Constitution has been at least adequate for the Great Depression, world wars, civil-rights movements, waves of immigrants, hysterias of the right and left, and crusades of all forms. It is far from perfect, but it seems to work here.    Denis Killeen   West Hartford, Conn.   ---   The U.S. has managed to survive and prosper so far. In the meantime, we have rescued our most favorite nation twice from disaster. Muddling through, so long a British characteristic, seems to have been a lesson well learned by this former colony from its former parent state. Sir Peter needs to keep a stiff upper lip, and trust in God and the United States of America.    J.L. Gray   Cartersville, Ga.   ---   The short answer to Sir Peter and others who deplore the inefficiency of the American system of government was given by Justice Brandeis many years ago: &quot;The doctrine of the separation of powers was adopted by the Convention of 1787, not to promote efficiency but to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power. The purpose was, not to avoid friction, but, by means of the inevitable friction incident to the distribution of the governmental powers among three departments, to save the people from autocracy.&quot; (Myers v. U.S., 1926.)    Daniel A. Rezneck   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
