This will give peacenegotiations under the auspices of the United Nations &quot;every chance to work,&quot;Bush said in a statement.;    &quot;I believe it is possible -- through tactics,training and equipment -- to re-establish the (military) balance we had beforeOctober,&quot; a senior U.S. officer said.;    Air mobility has provided a keycheck on insurgents for most of the civil war. The rebels' fierce offensive ofNovember 1989 was repelled only after combat planes bombed and shelledguerrilla-controlled neighborhoods.;    No support for insurrection;  Thatoffensive also showed that the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, orFMLN, did not command enough popular support to spark an insurrection. Theresult has been an effective stalemate; the overall casualty list of nearly75,000 grows, while secret peace talks continue.;    The United States nowviews negotiations as the only way out of the conflict.;    &quot;There's no suchthing as a military solution,&quot; the senior adviser said. &quot;This is 1991.&quot;;   The evolving U.S. view in part reflects how much the armed forces' positionhas eroded since Nov. 23, when the guerrillas first successfully used asurface-to-air missile to down an A-37 jet. They downed an AC-47 plane withanother missile Dec. 4, and they have shot down at least four helicopters, themost recent Thursday.;    U.S. chopper shot down;  One target was a U.S. Armytransport helicopter carrying three U.S. servicemen to Honduras from SanSalvador. Rebels opened automatic-rifle fire on the aircraft near Lolotique onJan. 2. All three crewmen were killed, although forensic evidence suggeststhat two survived the crash, only to be executed minutes later.;    Thehelicopter had been flying perilously low to avoid a missile attack.;   Salvadoran authorities estimate that the FMLN might have as many as 100 SA-7and SA-14 missiles in the country. The SA-14 is a much greater concern,because it has a longer range and lets the user know before he fires whetheror not its heat sensor has locked onto the target.;    Most, if not all, ofthe Soviet-made missiles are believed to have reached the FMLN from Nicaragua,where the Sandinista government left office in April.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Salvador, El Salvador  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910116  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  11A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  582  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday January 16, 199100016081,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
