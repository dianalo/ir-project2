Determined to stake out the strongest possible negotiatingposition, the Senate approved the White House's full $3.2billion request for B-2 Stealth bomber production, authorized$4.6 billion to accelerate deployment of anti-missiledefenses, and endorsed almost every other big-ticketprocurement and research project on the Pentagon's wish list.</LP><TEXT>   The $291 billion defense-authorization bill for the fiscalyear starting Oct. 1, passed on Friday with only smallchanges from the version adopted by the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, also includes $1 billion to restart production ofLockheed Corp.'s F-117 Stealth fighter. The authorizinglegislation defines which programs can be carried out andsets spending ceilings; actual outlays will be set inseparate appropriations bills.   During three days of Senate debate last week, backers ofthe bill repeatedly argued that all-out support for the WhiteHouse's position was essential to send the House anunequivocal signal to modify its position. Still, theadministration prevailed on key amendments by only a fewvotes, and President Bush interrupted his summit meeting inthe Soviet Union to call wavering lawmakers.   The House earlier this year voted overwhelmingly to killthe B-2, relegate antimissile research to the back burner byeliminating nearly half of the requested funding, andearmarking no money for additional F-117 purchases.Reconciling the two versions of the bill is expected to bearduous because the gap is so wide and because many HouseDemocrats are bound to dig in their heels to try to distancethemselves from Mr. Bush's military priorities before the1992 elections.   Both sides contend their version reflects the mostimportant lessons learned from the Persian Gulf war, but theSenate focused more heavily on nuclear weapons and voted, forthe first time, to have a limited, ground-based defenseagainst long-range missiles in place by 1996.   The Senate's sweeping measure deals with everything fromtroop cuts in Europe and allowing female pilots to fly jetfighters to prohibiting abortions in military hospitals. Butthe B-2 and anti-missile programs, dubbed the StrategicDefense Initiative, presented the greatest test for the WhiteHouse and Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), chairman of the ArmedServices Committee.   Despite concerted opposition from many Democrats, Sen.Nunn pushed through a new, bipartisan concept for SDI thatshelves deployment of space-based weapons for now. But thebill's call for hefty funding leaves the door wide open forsuch a move in the late 1990s. Sen. William Cohen (R., Maine)said the Senate finally reached &quot;a consensus that says we dohave a national interest&quot; in safeguarding the U.S. from theproliferation of ballistic missiles in the Third World.   The House, however, has voted consistently in the past twoyears to curtail SDI and block plans for deploying any of theanti-missile technology that the Pentagon has spent nearly$20 billion developing since the early Reagan years.   Resolving House-Senate differences over the B-2 built byNorthrop Corp. is likely to be easier, because many senatorshave acknowledged that they approved four new bombers largelyas a bargaining chip to keep the House from closing the B-2production line completely. Regardless of what happens thisyear, many supporters of the radar-evading bomber predict theAir Force won't get anywhere near the full 75-plane fleet itwants. The B-2 may sink of its own weight, as the cost ofeach plane edges closer to $1 billion and budget pressuresincreasingly squeeze construction money for more-popularweapons.</TEXT></DOC>
