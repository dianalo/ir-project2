One Cabinet minister resigned after admitting he had contactswith the notorious secret police, or Stasi, while about a dozenlawmakers came up to the microphone to deny or explain theaccusations against them.   The scene was a remarkable display of soul-searching by atroubled government in the final days of its brief existence.   The first freely elected Parliament in East German history willmeet one more time before it disbands on Wednesday, when the nationmerges with West Germany. Friday's anguished session lasted 12hours.   In one of its last acts, Parliament voted overwhelmingly to aska committee investigating the secret police to release the names of56 officials, three of them ministers and the rest Parliamentmembers, who were purportedly on the secret police payroll.  Lawmakers previously had authorized the committee to investigateindividual members of Parliament for ties to the despised policeunit.   Parliament also voted Friday to ask the committee to divulge thenames of the nine lawmakers in the 400-member Parliament whorefused to authorize the committee to investigate their secretpolice records.   Lawmakers gave those on the list a chance to address theaccusations.   Construction Minister Axel Viehweger did - he promptly resigned.He said he had contacts with the secret police while he was on theenergy council in the city of Dresden during the former government,which was toppled by a popular uprising last year.   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere told Parliament that theinvestigatory committee informed him Sept. 13 that three of hisministers had worked for the Stasi. He said one has resigned - anapparent reference to Viehweger - and two others had taken leavesof absence.   A total of 10 members of de Maiziere's 24-member Cabinet havestepped down since he took office earlier this year. It wasn'tknown which he was referring to.   The lawmakers who described their contacts with the secretpolice said such ties were required under the old government. Alldenied giving the Stasi information that hurt anyone.   Eberhard Schiffner, a Christian Democrat, said he was the headof a state veterinary practice in 1963. He had to give informationabout his practice to the secret police, he said.   He said he was not in a position to immediately detail thecontacts.   ``I need time, I need access (to his secret police file) and Ineed legal advice,'' he said.   Bernhardt Opitz, a lawmaker from the Free Democrat Party,dismissed the allegations against him as ``a pack of lies andinventions.''   ``The committee plays as judge and jury,'' he said angrily.   Brigitte Zschoche, a member of the reformed Communist Party,said she had contact with the secret police - when she was paid arecruiting visit by the Stasi in 1960.   Former Research and Technology Minister Frank Terpe, whoresigned last month when his Social Democrat party left thegoverning coalition, denied he worked for the secret police.   Since the fall of the Communist government that ruled for fourdecades, the nation has been obsessed with how to purge the tens ofthousands of former Stasi informants and agents from influentialroles in politics and business.   The Stasi, many of whose members held other jobs they used as acover, helped keep the former hard-line government in power throughstifling surveillance, intimidation and - allegedly - murder.   Because they and other elite members of the old government hadaccess to power, connections and money, they were able to maintainsome control of the nation after a new, inexperienced democraticgovernment was elected in March.   There have been reports that many former functionaries and Stasiagents are running businesses that were once state-owned but havenow been freed to operate as private enterprises.</TEXT></DOC>
