The legislation requires the approval of the Senate, Parliament's upper chamber.    The government estimated that corporate taxes would increase by 10% over the next five years as a result of the proposed elimination of various tax concessions. It also estimated that the number of profitable corporations not paying tax would be reduced by more than 50%.    Financial institutions, including banks and insurance companies, are expected to pay significantly more taxes under the proposed new system.    The legislation also reduces personal income tax rates and converts personal exemptions and some deductions to tax credits. By replacing exemptions with credits, the government said the tax system is &quot;fairer and more progressive.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
