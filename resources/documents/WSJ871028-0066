Most of the provisions are designed to reduce the burden of last year's tax law on specific companies, including Wells Fargo Bank, Federal Express, McLouth Steel Co. and Hartford Fire Insurance Co.    Republicans plan to cite these provisions in trying to defeat the Democrats' tax bill, which also includes tax increases intended to reduce the federal budget deficit.    &quot;The tax bill is vulnerable to attack because it would raise taxes at a time we shouldn't be raising taxes,&quot; said Rep. Judd Gregg (R., N.H.) &quot;But they (the Democrats) can't claim purely to be reducing the deficit when there's clearly this major taint to the bill -- using transition rules to buy votes.&quot;    According to a document prepared by Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, the tax bill contains dozens of special-interest provisions that together would cost the government an estimated $398 million in revenue over three years -- fiscal years 1988 through 1990. Most of them benefit companies or institutions in districts of Democratic leaders and Democrats on the tax-writing committees.    Rep. Robert Matsui (D., Calif.) said, &quot;Democrats were going to raise $12 billion in taxes, with or without these provisions. . . . It's something that happens all the time in tax legislation to provide transitional relief for some companies caught between old and new law.&quot;    Rep. Matsui noted that Republican members of the tax-writing panel had their own requests for provisions targeted for constituents, but these weren't considered when Republicans refused to participate in the tax-increase measure. &quot;Now that their items weren't included, they're saying these provisions are wrong.&quot;    The Republican document said one provision would allow Kaiser Aluminum andamp; Chemical Corp., which is located in the Spokane, Wash., district of House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, to carry back its investment tax credit for 15 years. This would enable it to offset its tax liability in prior years, essentially providing it with a $42 million tax refund.    Another provision would give McLouth Steel Co., in Trenton, Mich., special permission to carry forward net operating losses to offset future income at a cost to the federal government of $26 million. Southwestern Bell Corp., St. Louis, also would get special treatment for net operating losses.    Big banks with foreign operations stand to gain tax breaks as well with preferential treatment of their foreign tax credits. This provision would cost $80 million, the bulk of which would go to Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco, according to the Republicans' document.    Several utilities would benefit from special bond provisions. Duquesne Light Co., Pittsburgh, and San Diego Gas andamp; Electric Co. could use tax-exempt bonds for specific facilities. The total revenue loss would be $31 million. Another bond provision would give Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co., San Francisco, an $11 million tax break in a proposed purchase of a California utility district. Long Island Lighting Co. would get exemptions from rules in last year's tax bill limiting the use of bonds to acquire certain facilities.    Atlantic Richfield Co. would be allowed to use the generous depreciation schedules of prior law on a project in the North Slope of Alaska. This would provide a tax break of $9 million.    Several provisions are designed to help colleges, hospitals and sports stadiums in members' districts. These include Yale University, University of Miami, and a domed stadium in Cleveland.    Certain air carriers would be allowed to provide free flights to their employees as tax-free fringe benefits. The tax benefit for employees of Federal Express will cut revenue by an estimated $11 million. The same amount is listed for the PARS reservation venture of Trans World Airlines and Northwest Airlines.    Hartford Fire Insurance Co. would get a $1 million benefit from a special effective date on rules for certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries. Another $1 million measure would benefit a fiber optics network owned by a partnership of Southern New England Telecommunications and CSX Corp.    The document listing the beneficiaries was prepared for Republicans and represents their best estimates of which companies or other entities stand to gain.    In many cases, the provisions were vaguely worded, or &quot;camouflaged&quot; as one Republican put it. For example, one provision gives special tax treatment to a &quot;173-room hotel for which a UDAG grant (Urban Development Action Grant) was preliminarily approved on Feb. 2, 1986, and the rehabilitation of which was completed by April 16, 1987.&quot; After inquiries, Republicans determined that only one hotel fit this description-the Claridge Hotel in Chicago.    A few provisions were clear attempts to wipe out the tax liability of certain taxpayers. For example, one provision would forgive the $4 million estate tax due from an estate in Tarrant County, Texas, most of which is in the district of House Speaker James Wright.    &quot;Page after page after page of this belongs to powerful and senior Democrats,&quot; said Rep. Hal Daub (R., Neb.). He said the $400 million was used to &quot;buy&quot; unanimity of the Democrats on the bill. </TEXT></DOC>
