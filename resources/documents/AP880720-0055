The convention shouted enthusiastic approval of the platformTuesday night after soundly rejecting Jesse Jackson's call forhigher taxes on the wealthy and no U.S. first use of nuclearweapons. They also approved a raft of less controversial amendmentsagreed to by Jackson and Michael Dukakis.   There also was a carefully staged debate on Jackson's call forPalestinian self-determination, but by prior agreement the Jacksonforces withdrew that minority plank before a vote was taken.   An exultant Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard, who chaired thePlatform Committee, said, ``Tonight, the Democratic party unitesenduring values with new ideas to present a blueprint for a betterAmerica.''   ``Our platform offers challenges to put aside the selfishness,scandal and stagnation of the past eight years and to rekindle onceagain the values and spirit of our great American family,''Blanchard said.   Rep. Robert Matsui of California, who helped write it, said:``This platform is for our children. ... This is a document for thefuture of America.''   Despite concessions, there is nothing in the platform to giveDukakis any concern, said former Rep. Michael Barnes of Maryland,the prospective nominee's chief platform negotiator. The documentis devoid of specific budget promises.   ``We wanted to maintain a platform on which he could verycomfortably campaign and, frankly, which could help to unite theparty and which Democrats across the country could comfortablycampaign on,'' said Barnes.   In the past, many Democratic candidates have complained that anultra-liberal party platform was an albatross around their necks atelection time.   The Dukakis delegates defeated by 2,499 to 1,091.5 Jackson's``fair tax'' plank, which called for raising taxes on the wealthyand on corporations back to pre-Reagan levels. There were 90abstentions.   On the effort to rule out first use of nuclear weapons, theJackson forces picked up a few more delegates _ including Sen.Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, chairman of the Senate ForeignRelations Committee. But that proposed plank also was rejected onthe only other recorded vote, 2,474.1 to 1,220.6, with 67abstentions.   As promised, the Palestinian plank never came to a vote. ButJames Zogby, executive director of the Arab-American Institute,expressed satisfaction that the issue at least could be debated.   ``The deadly silence that submerged the issue of Palestinianrights has been shattered ... ,'' he said. ``We don't need votes.''   As Zogby spoke, supporters paraded a 30-foot banner reading``Self-Determination and Statehood for the Palestinian People.''   Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii called the Jackson language on theMiddle East plank ``a vicious kick in the teeth of America'sinterests in that part of the world.''   On Jackson's tax plank, Denver Mayor Fredrico Pena said, ``Idon't like throwing softballs to an opponent to knock out of thepark and a tax hike pitch is a grand slam for George Bush.''   The platform ran barely 5.000 words with the amendments.   Titled ``The Restoration of Competence and the Revival ofHope,'' it mentions neither Ronald Reagan or George Bush, butpromises to reverse ``voodoo economics,'' help the homeless andneedy, improve education and maintain ``more stable defensebudgets.''   The platform is barely one-eighth the length of the Democrats'1984 declaration of principles, and the shortest since the terseplatforms that Franklin D. Roosevelt rode to victory in the 1930s.</TEXT></DOC>
