Judge Herbert Dixon ordered Morgan, a plastic surgeon, to jailon contempt charges last Aug. 28 for refusing to reveal thelocation of her 5-year-old daughter, Hilary.   Morgan has claimed that her daughter was sexually abused onweekend visits to her former husband, Dr. Eric Foretich. AfterDixon ruled to allow Foretich broad visitation rights with thechild, Morgan hid the girl.   Since then, her medical practice has shut down and she hasaccumulated legal bills of nearly $1.5 million.   ``How do I feel? Angry, betrayed, fearful _ like any victim ofinjustice,'' Morgan said in a statement read by a supporter at therally. ``Have I ever thought of giving up, of telling the judgewhere she is? Not once.''   She described her daughter as ``safe and healing.''   Morgan's bid for freedom is stalled in Washington, but a federalappeals court in Richmond, Va., last May ordered a lower court toreconsider evidence excluded from a suit filed by Morgan againstForetich last year in Fairfax County, Va., Circuit Court.   The evidence includes statements of alleged sexual abuse made bythe child, as well as allegations by Hilary's half-sister that shewas also abused while in the custody of their father.   Foretich, an oral surgeon in northern Virginia, claims thatphysical injuries to Hilary were caused by Morgan. He also hasoffered a reward for information about the whereabouts of hisdaughter.   Morgan's attorneys have asked the District of Columbia Court ofAppeals to review Morgan's jailing, but the court is not expectedto consider the matter until next May.   The whereabouts of Hilary, who turns 6 on Aug. 21, remainunknown.</TEXT></DOC>
