To analyze the differences amongMinitab, SPSS, and SYSTAT, we compared their graphics capabilities andavailable procedures and tested their speed.andM;User interfaceandM;Don't expect a pure, Mac-like interface from any of these programs.andP;  All wereoriginally developed for the DOS and mainframe markets; as a result, theyretain at least some elements of a command-driven interface.andM;SYSTAT 5.0 provides a more Mac-like interface than do Minitab, SPSS, or itsown previous versions.andP;  It features pull-down, tear-off hierarchical menus,and you can specify most procedures by using menu selections and dialogboxes.andP;  The command language is still available, however, and it can beuseful in situations such as batch processing.andM;Minitab and SPSS are basically command-driven packages.andP;  They both havepull-down menus for manipulating windows, importing, saving, and printing,but otherwise they're nearly identical to their PC counterparts.andP;  SPSS iseasier to use than Minitab: It has a Command Input window and a hierarchicalmenu system called the Command Generator, which lets you select and pastecommands from a menu so you don't need to remember a long list of commands(see Figure 1).andP;  This isn't the same as using a true Mac-like graphicalinterface, however.andP;  You select commands in the same way as with a text-basedword processor - individually or as an entire batch process - and then submitthem.andM;Both Minitab and SPSS offer portability between the Mac and other systems.andO;Programs for other machines (VAX, PC) written in these two applications'internal command languages work with minimal or no changes on the Mac.andP;  PCSYSTAT command files work on the Mac as well.andM;Procedures AvailableandM;If you're looking for sophisticated multivariate analyses, you've come to theright place.andP;  Table I shows which functions are available in each package.andO;SPSS has the most procedures and options overall, but not all of them come aspart of the basic package: Four optional modules, costing $395 each, covertime-series analysis, tabling, conjoint and correspondence analysis, andother advanced statistics.andP;  Not surprisingly, SPSS, counting its modules, isthe most expensive of the three applications.andM;SYSTAT has the most procedures in its base package, and you can buy fouradditional modules: Design, which estimates sample sizes; Logit, for logisticregression; Probit, for estimating a multiple-regression model or analysis ofcovariance (ANOVA); and Testat, which provides test-summary statistics andreliability coefficients.andP;  Each of these supplements costs $1 10.andM;Minitab has the fewest procedures and options within procedures, and itdoesn't have add-on modules, although macros are available from its maker toperform some additional functions.andP;  The main procedures in Minitab that arenot in Data Desk 3.0, JMP, and StatView are time series, principalcomponents, and discriminant analysis; if you don't need any of theseprocedures, you should select one of the other three packages, which havebetter charts and exploratory-data-analysis procedures.andM;Graphics ToolsandM;The charts available in these packages differ in range, quality, andflexibility.andP;  Overall, SYSTAT is the most flexible program for graphicalrepresentation of numerical data (see Figure 2).andP;  It's the only program whosebasic package provides the capability to create colorcharts, and it has themost-comprehensive procedures for data exploration.andP;  SYSTAT features someunusual displays, such as mapping, polar graphs, contours, and 3-Dscatterplots, as well as more-traditional ones.andP;  Drawing tools are availablefor dressing up any plot and changing the font of axis labels and titles (seeFigure 3).andP;  SYSTAT's interactive exploratory chart tools (3-D rotating plots,brushing, and slicing, for example) aren't available in SPSS and Minitab.andM;SPSS' graphics displays are available in low-resolution mode only, althoughthe package provides an interface to Computer Associate's Cricket Graph, soyou can create high-quality scatterplots and charts.andP;  CA-Cricket Graph letsyou add color to your graphs and plots, but it cannot create 3-D scatterplotsor contour plots.andM;Minitab produces most of its analytical charts in the Output window inlow-resolution mode.andP;  You can create traditional scatterplots and bar and piecharts with high-resolution in separate graphics windows, but you can't editor include titles in these charts.andP;  Color is not available.andM;Memory and Hardware RequirementsandM;Minitab, SPSS, and SYSTAT differ vastly in terms of their memory and hardwarerequirements.andP;  Minitab requires the least hard-disk space (2.5 megabytes) andcan run in only I megabyte of RAM.andP;  SPSS needs plenty of hard-disk space(ranging from 6 to 15 megabytes), depending on how many modules you install,and at least 2 megabytes of RAM.andM;SYSTAT needs very little hard-disk space (only 3 to 4 megabytes), but it eatsup RAM.andP;  The minimum requirement is listed as 4 megabytes, and this is trulya minimum.andP;  We couldn't perform all the plots and analyses for this articleon an SE/30 with 4 megabytes, and we couldn't use other applications underMultiFinder at the same time.andP;  As this article went to press, SYSTATannounced a 2-megabyte version of SYSTAT 5.0 that should alleviate theseproblems.andM;Processing SpeedandM;To test these programs' processing speed, we used the same tests we used torate Data Desk 3.0, Exstatix, JMP, and StatView in last April's review.andO;Using a Mac SE/30 with 4 megabytes of RAM running under MultiFinder, wetested each application's speed by performing four common operations:regression (including computing and saving residuals), time-series analysis(ARIMA modeling and ACF and PACF plots), charting low- and high-resolutionscatterplots, and importing a tab-delimited ASCII file containing 400 cases.andO;Figure 4 shows the results.andM;If you're looking for speed, SPSS and Minitab are the fastest, althoughMinitab is slow at data importing.andP;  In almost all our tests, SYSTAT brings upthe rear.andP;  It's not only slower than Minitab and SPSS, but in many cases,it's slower than other statistical packages for the Mac.andP;  It's important tonote, however, that we tested the 4-megabyte version of SYSTAT 5.0; theslimmed-down 2-megabyte version is much less memory-intensive.andM;Unique FeaturesandM;Each of these programs has its own unique qualities; you have to look at themindividually to get the full picture.andM;Minitab 6.2.andP;  Minitab is much leaner than the other two packages in terms ofprocedural availability, charting capabilities, and interface design, butdon't be deceived by its Spartan character.andP;  Its command language is easy tolearn, even for someone who comes solely from a Mac background, and it can befast for running analyses.andP;  You can edit a command-procedure file withminiWRITER (see Figure 5), a text-editor DA that comes with Minitab.andP;  A nicefeature is the ability to build and nest macros to automate complicatedanalyses.andM;Minitab also handles data well.andP;  You can easily create, manipulate, and savevariables (such as residuals) in regression analyses with easy-to-learncommands such as &quot;PUT RESIDS INTO C3.&quot;andM;This package would be much easier to use if its skimpy manual and on-linehelp were beefed up.andP;  Both of these need more general statistics information,more explanations about procedural options, and more examples.andP;  The manualclearly explains commands for common analyses, but commands for more esotericones (such as the ARIMA model, described in the &quot;Time-Series Analysis&quot;sidebar) are harder to figure out.andM;Minitab may well be your best choice if you need quick answers to researchquestions and you have other applications for doing your presentationgraphics.andM;SPSS for the Macintosh 4.0.andP;  With its many modules, SPSS provides mostprocedures that professional analysts need.andP;  You pay for this wide range ofprocedures, however, in both software costs and disk space.andM;SPSS has many features - such as excellent on-line help, the useful CommandGenerator, and clear documentation - that make its non-Mac interface easierto use.andM;Although you can't change the font size and style in SPSS' Output window, youcan edit text to include comments, remove items, or relabel output tables.andP;  Ahandy rectangular editing tool in this window enables columnar cutting andpasting (see Figure 6).andM;Graphically, SPSS has some flaws.andP;  Linking SPSS to CA-Cricket Graph forhigh-resolution charting is indirect and limited by CA-Cricket Graph'ssomewhat narrow options.andP;  To generate a CA-Cricket Graph file, you have tosubmit the CRICKET command in SPSS with a list of variables and with thechart type you need.andP;  Generating the chart requires you to leave SPSS andthen open CA-Cricket Graph and the newly generated Cricket data file.andM;SYSTAT 5.0.andP;  SYSTAT 5.0 is easier to use than and remedies many of thedrawbacks of previous versions but at the cost of intensive memoryrequirements.andP;  Its interface is now much more Mac-like, and access to itsabundant statistics and charting procedures is through two convenienttear-off, hierarchical menus.andP;  It has kept some of the slow and awkward data-and variable-handling features of its earlier versions, however.andM;The package has exploratory-data-analysis tools, such as scatterplot brushingand selecting (see Figure 3).andP;  You can use these tools to locate plotoutliers in the Data Editor and to make subsets of a plot's data values forother analyses.andM;SYSTAT's 3-D spinning plots let you probe your data for interestingrelationships that are not visible in fixed views.andP;  These tools aren't asextensive and flexible as those in JMP and Data Desk 3.0, but they'resuperior to anything that Minitab and SPSS offer.andM;SYSTAT has flexible and easy-to-use charting procedures, but its speedproblems, memory limitations (in the 4-megabyte version), and awkward datahandling can be annoying.andP;  Unlike SPSS and Minitab, SYSTAT can't hold newvariables created by procedures in memory; instead, users must open new filesin which to store them.andP;  Constructing a chart with a variable from theoriginal data set and a newly computed variable requires you to cut and pasteto combine the two data sets.andP;  To perform analyses by subgroups (by sex, forexample), you have to presort the data set by the grouping variable, save itin a new file, and then open the new file for the subgrouping analysis.andP;  InSPSS or Minitab, a one- or two-word &quot;by sex&quot; subcommand performs the sameanalysis.andM;The Final AnalysisandM;If you want sophisticated statistical analysis, note that each of thesepackages requires some study before you can fully make use of its features.andO;Expect also to face some performance trade-offs when deciding whichapplication to buy.andP;  If you get SYSTAT expecting the intuitive interface ofthe typical Mac application, you'll be disappointed.andP;  Yes, it has dialogboxes and tear-off menus, but selecting options in its jam-packed dialogboxes is not a trivial feat.andP;  On the other hand, if you choose SPSS andMinitab because you're familiar with their DOS or VAX counterparts, you mayend up limiting the data exploration you can do.andP;  You'll also lose efficiencyif you have to use other software for your graphics.andM;Whichever package you select, you'll be happy that you no longer need to relyon other platforms to answer the research questions you want to ask.andM;Statistics programs can't do everything, however.andP;  If you want to be able tomanipulate algebraic equations on your Mac at a fairly sophisticated level, aprogram such as Prescience's Theorist or Wolfram Research's Mathematica maybe what you need.andM;Two Modern Math LabsandM;Since the advent of personal computers, business people have been able to askwhat-if questions and find quick answers on computers.andP;  What if a loan werepaid off a year sooner or a contractor's final costs were twice the projectedamount? Plug the right equations into Lotus 1-2-3 or Excel, and out pop theanswers.andP;  Scientists, however, have rarely had this luxury, because mostspreadsheets are poor at understanding the equations of matrices, integralsand derivatives, vectors, and complex numbers that describe the physicalworld.andM;Lately, several math programs that deal with equations have come to therescue.andP;  These packages are modern-day mathematics labs, letting users enter,manipulate, and visualize the behavior of almost any mathematical expression.andO;Two of the most popular and powerful such programs for the Mac areMathematica (see &quot;Enter Mathematica,&quot; November  88, page 199) and Theorist(see review, June '90, page 57).andM;Yin and YangandM;Mathematica and Theorist evolved over disparate paths into programs withsimilar capabilities but very different user interfaces.andP;  Theorist ispublished by Prescience, which produces Expressionist (see review, July '90,page 80), an intuitive and much-acclaimed DA for mathematical typesetting.andO;Expressionist knows all the rules about typefaces and sizes for producingpictures of equations, but it knows none of the rules for solving andmanipulating them.andP;  After receiving countless requests, Prescience developedTheorist as a tool for solving, manipulating, graphing, and animating theequations Expressionist can typeset.andP;  Not surprisingly, moving equationsbetween Expressionist and Theorist is a simple matter of standard cut andpaste.andM;Theorist adheres strictly to the WYSIWYG doctrine, displaying equations in&quot;standard&quot; mathematical notation, complete with integral signs, superscripts,and proper punctuation (see Figure 7).andP;  (There is also a FORTRAN-like modefor those who'd rather work in a procedural language.) When the programperforms calculations, changes take effect immediately, so you're never leftwondering whether die current display needs to be updated.andP;  With Theorist,you can also manipulate equations by using point-and-drag techniques.andM;Mathematica takes a different approach to symbolic math.andP;  It has acommand-line interface and block-character representation of equations thatdiffers from the textbook manner of representing them.andM;The program requires that all input comprise linear rows of symbols, the sameway equations are expressed in computer languages such as FORTRAN.andO;Calculations are performed in batches by the command-processor kernel, the&quot;core&quot; of the program, which turns commands into output.andP;  The kernel defaultsto returning its output in a hybrid linear-row format (see Figure 8).andP;  If youwish, you can save output equations in a file format readable by the popularTeX equation-formatting language, which is understood by a variety of Macword processors.andM;Moth MuscleandM;Interface aside, Mathematica and Theorist are built to perform many of thesame tasks.andP;  Both programs can solve integral and differential equations,either numerically or exactly, if possible and if within their repertoires ofknown solutions.andP;  Both can factor polynomials and simplify complicatedexpressions.andP;  Both can solve systems of linear equations and perform matrixmanipulations.andP;  Both can work with complex numbers and geometric andtrigonometric functions.andP;  And both programs come with extensive libraries ofspecial functions such as Bessel and gamma functions that you can extendindefinitely.andM;Mathematica performs all calculations exactly (or symbolically) unless youask for numerical results, although you can instruct it to print any answerto a specific number of decimal places.andP;  There's no limit to how large orsmall numbers can be.andP;  Theorist maintains rational expressions in native formif desired, but it truncates individual numbers to 19 decimal places.andP;  Mostusers will notice no difference between the programs.andM;Both of them use the notebook metaphor.andP;  When first launched, each programopens up a text-editor-like screen, where you enter equations.andP;  As thesession progresses, the programs retain information and you can edit, move,or save it as desired.andP;  Once you've collected a set of definitions,equations, and/or graphs that might be useful in the future, you can save thenotebook as a starting point for later work (see Figure 7 for an example ofTheorist's notebooks).andM;You can program both Theorist and Mathematica, although only Mathematicasupports procedural programs, which are similar to having a macro languageavailable.andP;  This means that Theorist and Mathematica can accept definitionssuch as a = 5 or rules such as &quot;the function MYFUNCTION is defined to producethe reciprocal of the sine of its argument&quot; and apply them when appropriate.andO;Mathematica, however, lets you go beyond solving equations to automating theprocedures used to solve them.andM;Graphic MathandM;When it comes to charting, Theorist and Mathematica can handle simple x-yplots, contour plots, parametric plots, and various kinds of 3-D plots.andP;  Bothsupport full 32-bit color, with striking results.andP;  And both programs cananimate sets of graphs -useful for visualizing the effects of modifying oneparameter of an equation.andM;Theorist's graphs and animations are easier to create and modify than areMathematica's.andP;  With Theorist, creating a graph requires selecting theappropriate equation and then selecting the desired graph type from a menu(see Figure 9).andP;  You change characteristics such as size, scale, perspective,and color by using menus, buttons, and a list of charting characteristicsthat accompanies each graph.andM;Mathematica generates each chart from a command batch, building up the chartfrom elementary pieces such as line segments and polygons.andP;  It then producesthe chart in PostScript, which is interpreted into the QuickDraw picture yousee on-screen (see Figure 10).andP;  Each time you change a parameter, you mustmodify the command (which often requires a trip to the user manual) andrepeat the process.andM;Which is fop Me?andM;Although Mathematica and Theorist solve similar problems, differences intheir user interfaces and networking capabilities, and even in their cost,will ultimately determine which program is best for a particular application.andO;In a few cases, the decision will be clear-cut, because one package has arequired feature and the other doesn't.andP;  In other cases, the question ofwhich program's interface feels more comfortable to a particular user willcarry more weight.andM;Both Mathematica and Theorist are well-designed and well-implementedprograms.andP;  Their documentation is complete and thorough, and technicalsupport by phone (and by fax and an electronic bulletin board, in the case ofMathematica) should quickly remedy any serious problems.andP;  If cost is animportant consideration, note that Theorist, at $379.95, is less expensivethan Mathematica, which costs $495 ($795 for the Mac 11 version).andM;As with any open-ended, memory-intensive program on the Mac, both Theoristand Mathematica have the habit of running out of memory when generatingespecially complex graphs or solving particularly involved equations(although Theorist is leaner and can run simple 3-D animations with Imegabyte of RAM).andP;  Operating without MultiFinder and with as much RAM aspossible, as well as cutting back on the number of INITs in your SystemFolder, helps.andP;  (System 7.0's virtual-memory capabilities will also alleviatethis problem - if you have hardware that supports it).andP;  Both programs usuallyexit gracefully from such memory shortages and tell you what has happened.andM;So how to choose? Here are a few features you may want to look at whendeciding:andM;Interface.andP;  Theorist is a Mac application in the true sense.andP;  The menus, iconbars, graph buttons, and input system - in short, all aspects of the program- were designed to be easy to understand and use (see Figure I 0).andP;  Thedialog boxes that pop up periodically to ask for help in defining unknownsare exceptionally clear.andP;  The format of notebooks makes it easy to collect aset of definitions you use often and keep it handy.andP;  And the immediatefeedback Theorist provides after every manipulation adds confidence thatyou're on the right track.andM;On the other hand, Mathematica is a tool that will please high-endprogrammers.andP;  It is sufficiently un-Maclike to make even the most devout UNIXusers happy and contains a book full of commands to master.andP;  It makes gooduse of the Mac's charting abilities and even adds nice Mac-style touches tothe notebook editor, so you can cut, paste, and otherwise manipulate previouswork easily.andP;  Its programming language is a fun tool for the curious toexplore - you can use it to perform arcane tasks such as list processing andgeneration.andM;Network compatibility.andP;  Mathematica is supported not only on the Mac but alsoon other personal computers and on many UNIX workstations and supercomputers.andO;All implementations of the Mathematica kernel are compatible as long as theyhave the same version number.andM;Mathematica for the Mac has a networking window and protocols, so you canmake connections to other Mathematica kernels.andP;  Usually you can manipulateequations efficiently without networking, but for especially largecalculations, the ability to use the friendly Mac interface and the rawnumber-crunching power of a remote computer is crucial.andP;  Theorist works onlyon the Mac and includes no networking capability (other than simpleApp]eTalk-supported file sharing).andM;Even if you're a lone Mac user and don't require the computational assistanceof a workstation or supercomputer, you may find the ability to exportMathematica charts in native PostScript helpful.andP;  Both Mathematica andTheorist can save graphs as PICT2 items.andM;Procedural programming.andP;  For most applications, complex programming is notrequired.andP;  For some sophisticated tasks, however - such as finding roots orsolving simultaneous equations - complicated functions involving decisionloops or iteration are necessary.andP;  If you need these functions, Mathematicais your only choice.andM;The Best FitandM;High-school and college math students, as well as professionals who need toautomate equation manipulation, will be happiest with Theorist'scapabilities.andP;  Formula-typing errors are easy to see, and you can instantlyprepare complex graphs from equations.andP;  Graph default settings are wellchosen and easy to change.andP;  Theorist doesn't require users to have any priorknowledge of computer programming, and it makes fewer demands on systemmemory and disk space than does Mathematica.andM;Many commercial scientists and engineers who need quick solutions tointegrals or fast plots of a theory will also be pleased with Theorist'scapabilities.andP;  Users who need to develop functions with proceduralprogramming or who are networked into workstations or supercomputers runningMathematica - and who don't mind taking the time to learn its sometimescontorted procedural language - will appreciate Mathematica's additionalcapabilities.andP;  Often, these are users with Macs that have more than 5megabytes of memory and plenty of disk space for intensive Mathematicasessions.andM;A growing number of serious number-crunching programs are filtering into theMacintosh world from other platforms; still more are being created especiallyfor the Mac and Mac-only users.andP;  With tools such as these, the Mac can be aserious high-end tool for study, research, and analysis.andM;Linda Custer, a research biochemical engineer at W.R.andP;  Grace andamp; Co. InColumbia, Maryland, reviewers science, engineering, and mathematicalsoftware.andP;  Minna Levine is a statistics and market-research consultant toutbased in Belmont, Massachusetts.andP;  She writes about business applications forDOS machines and  the Mac.andM;Minitab 6.2, SPSS for the Macintosh 4.0, and SYSTAT 5.0andM;These high-end statistics packages allow you to perform sophisticatedprocedures such as time-series analyses.andP;  Deciding which statistics packageto buy boils down to knowing which procedures you must have and how muchmoney you can afford to spend.andM;If you need lots of procedures and can afford all its modules, SPSS ($795;additional modules, $395 each) is the top choice.andP;  if you need procedures,such as multivariate or ARIMA procedures, that are more sophisticated thanthose available in a lower-priced statistics package but you have limitedfunds and limited hardware, Minitab ($695) is best.andP;  If you need lots ofprocedures and high-quality charts, go for SYSTAT ($795; additional modules,$110).andM;Remember, however, that with SPSS or Minitab, you not only need an additionalcharting package but you also miss out on the fun of using the Mac'sinteractive graphical interface to explore your data.andM;Mathematica and TheoristandM;Mathematica and Theorist are powerful equation solvers.andP;  Theorist fromPrescience ($379.95) has an easy-to-use Mac interface and can prepare evencomplex graphs from equations instantly.andP;  It does not require any priorknowledge of computer programming, and it makes fewer demands on systemmemory and disk space than does Mathematica.andP;  Complex procedural programmingis not possible.andM;Wolfram Research's Mathematica ($495; Mac 11 version, $795) is more suitablefor users who need to develop functions by using procedural programming orwho are networked into mainframes running Mathematica on other platforms.andO;Mathematica is memory-intensive and requires you to learn its difficultsyntax.andM;If you don't need all of Theorist's and Mathematica's power and functions butstill want a program that has some math muscle, here are a couple of programsto consider.andM;Maple 4.2.1andM;Maple, a popular algebra program on IBM, Digital, and Honeywell mainframecomputers, has now been adapted to run on the Mac.andP;  The Mac version ($395) issomewhat akin to Mathematica, containing a procedural programming languageand a command processor.andP;  it has no facilities for accessing mainframecomputing power or for generating 3-D graphs, however.andP;  Input and output areline-based, and complex equations look nothing like their typesetcounterparts.andM;Maple has many of the same features that might attract users to chooseMathematica rather than Theorist.andP;  You can use Maple's procedural language tobuild customized root-finding algorithms or to implement solution algorithmsfor ordinary differential equations.andP;  The program even provides examples ofoptimizations, computed efficiently by the Simplex method, written in theMaple language.andP;  Maple programs are a little less cryptic than Mathematica's,and Maple has a higher symbolic level than does Mathematica - for example, itallows you to symbolically solve some differential equations.andM;Maple was developed as a tool for teaching computation and mathematics at theuniversity level, and it performs this function very well.andP;  it's also auseful tool for any practicing engineer or scientist who doesn't needMathematica's stellar graphical or networking capabilities.andP;  Brooks/ColePublishing Go., 511 Forest Lodge Road, Pacific Grove, CA 93950; (408)373-0728.andM;Milo 1.0andM;Paracomp's Milo ($249), a math processor,' bears some resemblance to Theorist(see review, July '90, page 80).andP;  It shares Theorist's qualities of beingtrue to the Mac WYSIWYG interface, it's extensible through notebooks and rulesharing, and it doesn't have a procedural programming language.andP;  Miloperforms symbolic mathematical manipulations competently, but R's lesspowerful than Theorist is.andM;Milo's user manual lacks some elements: It presents a thorough description ofwhat each command is for and then neglects to show the command action forperforming tasks such as solving sets of simultaneous equations.andP;  Milosupports the creation of x-y graphs, but you can't use it to create color or3-D plots.andM;Milo is the least expensive product of the four reviewed here and is also theleast hungry for raw hardware -a Mac Plus and a floppy-disk drive can runMilo comfortably - so it will appeal to many less demanding yet inquisitivemathematicians.andP;  High-school and college students who want to investigate thebehavior of the vectors and integrals they study will find Milo up to thetask.andP;  It could also be useful for budding geniuses taking their firstalgebra or geometry course in grade school.andP;  Its well-designed userinterface, which lets you enter equations in many different ways, makes thejob a little easier too.andP;  Paracomp, Inc., 123 Townsend St., Suite 310, SanFrancisco, CA94107; (415) 543-3848.andM;Time-Series AnalysisandM;Until SPSS and Minitab were released, SYSTAT was the only general statisticspackage for the Mac to include time-series procedures, which many businessand engineering companies use for such tasks as managing quality control andinventory or for tracking stock prices, interest rates, inflation, andhousing starts.andP;  Time-series analyses are used to predict future quantitiesby looking at how the quantity has changed in the past.andP;  They can also beused to study what impact an intervention will have on an activity.andM;To illustrate the procedures that are involved in a time-series analysis, weused the three packages to perform a classic textbook time-series analysis:Forecasting future airline-passenger volume from a data set of the number ofmonthly international airline passengers over an 11-year period.andM;The data contains several trends that make this analysis difficult: Thenumber of passengers is not constant over the course of a year, and certainseasons (late summer, for example) are peak travel times (see Figure 2).andO;More-continuous trends-the inflation rate, for example - also need to beconsidered.andP;  A time-series analysis lets you develop a mathematical model ofthe data that takes these trends into account when predicting future travelpatterns.andM;Specialized plots let analysts use data from the previous month and seasonaltrends to uncover current influences on data values.andP;  By contrasting theplots, analysts can decide which data transformations they need to performbefore they can create a usable model of future trends,andM;With SPSS you can specify these transformations on the command line.andP;  WithSYSTAT, however, you must make separate choices from the Series menu.andP;  WithMinitab you need to use three separate data transformation commands.andM;Finding the right model is an iterative process; we found it easier to changethe settings in SYSTAT's dialog box or to change SPSS' few commands than tochange Minitab's commands.andM;You can either print or save and chart the forecasted values along with theoriginal series.andP;  SYSTAT saves data clumsily, but it produces the bestcharts.andP;  SPSS saves data easily but requires switching to CACricket Graph forproducing attractive graphics.andP;  Minitab is good at saving data, but itproduces the least attractive charts.andM;Visual Data Analysis: Not just a Pretty FaceandM;Scientists and engineers at large research facilities have incrediblecomputer power at their disposal, but a growing number of them are spendingmuch of their time sitting in front of a Macintosh - and loving it.andP;  TheMac's ease of use, convenience, and large software library are among thethings that have attracted them.andP;  in many cases, however, the drawing card isthe Macintosh's great graphics capabilities, which allow scientists toconvert data into graphics for visual analysis.andM;Recent Macintosh applications have given users the ability to compress asmany as a million points of data in a single color graphic.andP;  Add animation toit, and you can then display many times more data in rapid sequence.andP;  A lotof modern researchers use these techniques in association with mathematicaland statistical modeling in order to gain the broadest possible spectrum ofviewpoints for understanding a researchandM;It's not only high-level researchers who make use of visual data analysis.andO;There are a number of commonly used programs that let Macintosh usersinvestigate data from a visual standpoint - these range from home-investmentapplications that let you plot stock-market trends to the mathematics andstatistics programs that are discussed in this article.andM;Figure A shows a simulated supernova blast wave created by scientists atLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, using Image software from NCSA (theNational Center for Supercomputing Applications).andP;  The NCSA created some ofthe first high-end visual-data-analysis applications for the Macintosh, andthis project produced observation predictions to be tested with the Hubblespace telescope.andM;NCSA Image, DataScope, and PalEdit are all public-domain software (free ifyou download it; $30 on-disk) that can transform large data sets into8-bit-color graphics and that let users edit the palette for optimum effect.andO;NCSA, University of Illinois Urbana/Champaign, 605 E. Springfield Ave.,andO;Champaign, IL 61820; (217) 244-0072.andM;Spyglass markets four software products that have their origins inNCSA'spublic-domain software: View ($395), Transform $395), Dicer  $495), andFormat ($195).andP;  Although they have the same file format as the NCSAapplications, Spyglass has polished them and added new functions.andP;  Dicer, forexample, lets you view cross-sections of a color matrix (see Figure B).andO;Spyglass Transform and Spyglass View were released earlier this year (seereview, October '90, page 72); Dicer and Format should be available by thetime you read this.andP;  Spyglass, Inc., 701 Devonshire Drive, C-17, Champaign,IL 61820;andM;(217) 355-1665.andM;1 or $295 is a data-analysis tool for scientists and engineers (see review,August '90, page 48).andP;  its analysis capabilities include a generalmathematical-expression evaluator, a whole range of curve-processingoperations, and a macro facility.andP;  Igor's data analysis is based on a datastructure called a wave.andP;  Each wave consists of a one-dimensional array ofnumbers; you can create as many waves as you need.andM;One of Igor's uses is in curve fitting, in which researchers create a mathfunction to model data derived from expedments - for instance, the widths oflaser pulses (see Figure C).andP;  WaveMetrics, P.O.
