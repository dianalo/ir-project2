Also today, the president of the guerrilla government-in-exiletold the Afghan people in his first radio broadcast from Pakistanthat his fighters are ``on the verge of final victory'' over theirgovernment's forces.   The insurgents fired long-range artillery late Tuesday at theSamarkhiel fortress and overran it this morning, a guerrillaspokesman named Satullah said in the Pakistani border city ofPeshawar.   Several other Afghan sources confirmed Satullah's claim, butthere was no independent confirmation. No casualty count was given.   The guerrillas attacked the airport at the same time as theSamarkhiel offensive, a guerrilla source said on condition ofanonymity.   Insurgents destroyed a military transport plane parked at theairport Tuesday, and Radio Kabul said two people were killed. Theradio report monitored in Islamabad gave few details but wasconfirmed by rebel sources.   Satullah said guerrilla positions around Jalalabad, particularlyto the south of the city, were heavily bombed in retaliation forrebels' Samarkhiel conquest. Another rebel source said ``there wasindiscriminate bombing last night and this morning.''   The rebels downed a helicopter gunship and Soviet-made MiG-25fighter jet today near Jalalabad, said Satullah. The governmentaircraft were hit by U.S.-made missiles. There were no survivors, hesaid.   Guerrilla sources gave conflicting reports about the fighting atJalalabad airport, with one source claiming the insurgents hadcaptured it.   ``The fighting at the airport is still continuing,'' Satullahsaid.   Stinger missiles, which Washington began supplying to theguerrillas almost two years ago, are credited with inflicting costlylosses on Moscow's air force during the nine-year Soviet militaryintervention that ended last month.   In a 16-minute radio address from the guerrillas' headquarters inPeshawar, the leader of the government-in-exile, SibghatullahMojaddidi, told Afghans:   ``We have no doubt at all that the puppet ... government which isresponsible for the killing, the destruction and the displacement ofmillions of Afghan refugees will never be able to stand againstAfghanistan again.''   He said his top priority is the ``complete removal of thegovernment in Kabul, the return of peace and security to the wholecountry, and preparations for the suitable conditions for the returnof reguees.''   Mojaddidi called on the United Nations and the Islamic Conferenceorganization to recognize his government-in-exile, which says itwill hold its first Cabinet meeting Friday at an undisclosedlocation inside Afghanistan.   Jalalabad is about 45 miles west of the Pakistan border on thehighway that connects Pakistan and the Afghan capital of Kabul.</TEXT></DOC>
