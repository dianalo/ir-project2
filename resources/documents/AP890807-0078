Expresses Optimism About Hostages</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Clovis Maksoud, the Arab League observer atthe United Nations, expressed optimism today that intensediplomatic efforts will lead to the freeing of all hostages inLebanon.   ``I think the prospects of success are much more preponderantthan at any time before,'' Maksoud told a news conference at theNational Press Club here.   ``The negotiations have been intensified,'' he said. ``There isa better chance to return all hostages.''   Maksoud credited what he said is an improved diplomaticenvironment, ``new developments in Iran'' and the involvement ofAlgeria, Syria and the International Red Cross.   He contended that the abduction by Israeli commandos of ShiekAbdul Karim Obeid, a militant Moslem cleric, is not a factor in thepotential release of hostages.   ``If there is to be a release of all the hostages, it is notbecause Israel did the kidnapping'' (of Obeid), he said.   ``The release of the hostages would be the result of mediationefforts,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
