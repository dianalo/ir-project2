The admission Sunday by Hussein Mousawi was the first timeHezbollah, or Party of God, has acknowledged its relations withgroups holding the 16 captives.   ``If America is able to help itself and help its hostages bystopping its support for Israel and by not participating inanything that hurts Moslems in Lebanon ... this could encourageHezbollah to think of a way to help resolve the hostage issue,''Mousawi said.   He also said Hezbollah might kill a captured Israeli soldierunless Israel frees an abducted Shiite Moslem cleric.   Mousawi spoke at a meeting with foreign reporters arranged byHezbollah in the ancient town of Baalbek, 50 miles northeast ofBeirut.   Reporters asked what would happen to two Israeli soldiers thegroup holds if Israel does not free Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, aHezbollah-affiliated cleric.   ``If we find out that the interests of Islam and Moslems and theinterests of the oppressed dictates that one of the Israelisoldiers be killed, so will it be,'' Mousawi responded.   Israel refused comment on his statement.   Mousawi said some members of pro-Iranian organizations holdingthe 16 Western hostages in Lebanon are ``known to us and we holdconsultations with them from time to time.''   ``There are telephone calls, hello's between us,'' he added.   Hezbollah consistently has denied it has anything to do with theabductions, but the party generally is believed to be the umbrellafor Shiite Moslem extremists holding most Western hostages.   The kidnappers ``may listen to us more than they would toAlgeria because our voice is closer to them and we're livingtogether'' in the same areas, Mousawi said.   Algeria's ambassador to Lebanon, Khaled Hasnawi, has said hiscountry is undertaking a new initiative to free all the Westernhostages.   Mousawi denied there have been any negotiations on an Israelioffer to trade Obeid and Shiite prisoners for three Israeliservicemen and all the Western hostages.   ``Let them (the Israelis) kidnap 250 more clerics, there will beno negotiations. Let them kidnap two-thirds of Hezbollah if theycould, there will be no negotiations,'' he said.   Israeli commandos on July 28 abducted Obeid, 33, with twocompanions from his house in southern Lebanon.   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, another pro-Iraniangroup, said it killed U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins onJuly 31 because Israel refused to free Obeid.   Higgins, 44, helped command U.N. peacekeepers in south Lebanonuntil he was kidnapped on Feb. 17, 1988. A U.N. envoy, MarrackGoulding, has been in Lebanon trying to find Higgins' body anddetermine the circumstances of his death.</TEXT></DOC>
