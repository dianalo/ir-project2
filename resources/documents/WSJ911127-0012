Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), chairman of the HouseWays and Means Committee, said he would start hearings nextweek on various tax-cut plans to spur the economy. Democraticplans generally would give a break to middle-incometaxpayers, and make up the revenue loss with higher incometaxes on wealthier taxpayers. A pending House GOP plan, incontrast, generally would cut taxes on businesses andindividuals' capital gains.</LP><TEXT>   The announcement came as Democrats scrambled lateyesterday to respond to a vague and confusing challenge fromPresident Bush. Mr. Bush, under pressure from HouseRepublicans led by second-ranking leader Newt Gingrich ofGeorgia, urged Congress to act immediately on the GOP tax-cutpackage. But the president, whose popularity has slid in thepolls under steady Democratic assault for his handling of theailing economy, didn't ask Congress to remain in session.   House Democrats feared that adjourning without some actionwould leave them vulnerable to GOP attacks that a do-nothingCongress went home for the holidays rather than address thecountry's ills. &quot;I'm going to invite President Bush and Mr.Gingrich to come down and testify on the Bush-Gingrichpackage so we can prudently proceed on writing a growthpackage,&quot; said a sarcastic Rep. Rostenkowski.   House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.), referring to Mr.Gingrich, said: &quot;He's accomplished absolutely nothing but putthe president in an embarrassing position.&quot;   Amid the furor, Congress struggled to finish itstop-priority legislation, especially bills providing fundsfor highway construction and for agencies charged withbailing out insolvent banks and thrift institutions. TheHouse and Senate also took the final action to extend joblessaid to the longtime unemployed, an issue that had dividedDemocrats and the president for four months. Mr. Foley saidthe House might return next week to complete any leftovers.   Earlier this month, Mr. Bush signed into law a measureproviding as many as 20 weeks of benefits to eligible joblessworkers who have exhausted their basic six months of stateaid. The measure approved unanimously in the House and Senateyesterday would raise the minimum level of benefits to 13weeks from six weeks. Also, it would make benefits availableretroactively to workers in all states who have run out ofstate aid since March. Currently, jobless workers in 18states aren't eligible for the retroactive provision.   The tempest over taxes has its roots in the release byHouse Republicans late last week of a package of proposedbusiness-tax cuts -- including reduced taxes on capital gains-- aimed at sparking the economy. The group demanded animmediate vote, in part to force Mr. Bush to reverse hisdecision to wait until January to unveil his owneconomic-stimulus package. The Republicans also proposed toadd their proposal to the thrift-bailout bill, therebythreatening legislation that is an administration priority.   The Republicans depicted the initiative as a challenge toDemocrats, but their strategy bared the divisions in theirown party. &quot;This is an argument going on between the WhiteHouse and Republicans in the House,&quot; said Mr. Foley.   For weeks, debate has raged within the adminstration overhow aggressively to confront Democrats over economic policy.The president has sided with officials -- including TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady, Budget Director Richard Darman andChief of Staff John Sununu -- who counseled restraint. Thatfaction argues that any year-end rush to cut taxes wouldignite a bidding war that could add to the deficit andfurther spook financial markets.   Senate GOP Leader Robert Dole of Kansas objected yesterdayto the House Republicans' rush to pass their plan. &quot;Wehaven't met with the president. He hasn't insisted to us thatwe ought to have a growth package before we adjourn,&quot; Sen.Dole said. &quot;In fact, the message I get is to the contrary.&quot;   House Republican leader Robert Michel (R., Ill.) opposeshis fellow Republicans' confrontational tactic. He saidpushing for a capital-gains tax cut could backfire. Reactingearlier this week to GOP plans such as theirs, he said: &quot;Italways begins with capital gains. And here again, you ask theaverage guy, and he says, `I don't see how that's going toaffect me all that much.'&quot; He added, it &quot;just reopens thewhole debate on rich man-poor man.&quot;   Yesterday, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D.,Mo.) released a study from Congress's Joint Committee onTaxation showing that the House GOP plan would give anaverage tax break of $24 to $84 a year to those earning up to$50,000 a year, and an average $11,561 to taxpayers withincomes of $200,000 and up. The findings reflect the effectsof two provisions: a proposed capital-gains tax cut forindividuals and a proposed exclusion from taxes of up to $450a family in income from interest on savings.   Speaker Foley upbraided Mr. Gingrich yesterday fordemanding action on a tax bill when &quot;every bit of informationI've received&quot; indicated that Mr. Bush wanted Congress toquit for the year.   Later, the president told reporters: &quot;I want the packagepassed and I want to see it done fast. . . . I am for this,would like to see it voted on today.&quot; But he immediatelyadded: &quot;There's no point in Congress sticking around, in myview.&quot;   The restiveness among House Republicans reflects a generalrebelliousness on the GOP right. Last week, 81 Republicanssigned a letter asking Mr. Bush to name Housing SecretaryJack Kemp as his domestic-policy czar, suggesting there is avoid within the administration in that area.   Mr. Kemp, who has been a highly visible ally of the GOPconservatives, yesterday dismissed the idea. &quot;I hate it,&quot; hesaid. &quot;The czar, as I understand it, got shot.&quot;   ---   Jeffrey H.
