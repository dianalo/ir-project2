Under these conditions, the POS insures an impedancerate of rise of -- 10/sup 9/ {Omega}/s to final values of -- 10-20 {Omega}.These parameters allow the POS to be considered as a basis for the creationof unique --10/sup 13/-W pulsed power generators as well as compact --10/sup 10/-W commercial generators.</TEXT></DOC>
