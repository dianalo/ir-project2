 economy nationwide, some MIS departments at healthinsurance companies and hospitals are increasing hardware spending over lastyear's levels.andM;&quot;In 1991 we are definitely planning to purchase more than in 1990,&quot; said BobChin, vice president of information systems at Tufts Associated and TotalHealth Plans, a health maintenance organization based in Waltham, Mass.andM;&quot;The main reason is that we generally buy major hardware upgrades every otheryear.andP;  We usually install a system that has a life cycle of about two yearsbefore we start looking for additional resources--more CPU or anothercomputer,&quot; Chin said.andM;Tufts, primarily a Hewlett-Packard shop, has two HP minicomputers--an HP 3000Series 70 and a Series 950--that serve about 250 users, Chin said.andP;  Thisyear's purchases will include an HP 3000 Series 958.andM;&quot;This will just about double our computing power and will help a lot in termsof our response time to users.andP;  Our batch jobs will go more smoothly andquickly, and it will be better for development and production,&quot; Chin said.andM;Because Tufts purchases only biannually, &quot;I'm going to have to make this babylast me until December 1992,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I want to buy enough computing powerto last us, since we can't go to the well every time we need it.&quot;andM;Chin added that HP has also come up with some reasonable pricing, eliminatingthe need to buy used equipment, a tactic he previously pursued.andM;He said software recently developed in-house will also run more efficientlyas a result of the increased CPU power, especially because more users will besigning on to take advantage of the applications.andM;Besides hardware, Tufts will also make purchases in software development.andM;Specifically, Chin said, Tufts will purchase database tools to helpapplication development and data retrieval.andM;As far as economizing on resources by implementing client/server computing,the company is moving cautiously forward, he said.andM;&quot;We are looking at a number of different possibilities--local area networksand wide area networks that hook clients on remotely, for instance--but we'removing very slowly and carefully because of issues such as confidentialityand the problems involved with managing networks,&quot; Chin said.andM;Hardware purchases ultimately might help cut costs in other ways by enablingTufts to bring in claims data electronically.andM;&quot;We now have an outside service that does some data entry for us, and we maybring that back in-house.andP;  We will wait to make a decision about it until wesee how the new system works for us,&quot; Chin said.andM;&quot;Up until now, outsourcing has been cheaper for us, but we're looking moreand more at the possibility of electronic claims transmission,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;This means that the hospitals don't send us paper, they send us a tape, andno data entry is required.andP;  Pulling data in this way is ideal, and electronicreading of claims is always more accurate.&quot;andM;Chin concluded that by bringing claims processing in-house he may incur moreup-front costs but save money in the long run.andM;&quot;It's a matter of paying now rather than later.andP;  We've gone to a number ofhospitals who now know what our specs are and comply with them.andP;  New EnglandMedical Center, for instance, is sending us 2,000 claims per weekelectronically,&quot; he said.andM;MORE PCs ON THE WAY FOR HOSPITALandM;Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston will increase its hardware spendingthis year with the purchase of IBM PCs, according to Meg Aranow, systems vicepresident of information at the hospital.andM;&quot;We'll be spending more on hardware and about the same on software,&quot; Aranowsaid.andM;Brigham and Women's Hospital has an installed base of Data General systemsand a Banyan Systems LAN, she said.andP;  It also has workstations installed invarious departments, including DECstations running DEC Rad for radiologyapplications.andM;She said the hospital's plans to purchase computer systems are at presentunaffected by belt-tightening.andM;&quot;I think systems spending in general tends to go in cycles.andP;  We are verycost-conscious, but this is simply an appropriate time for us to make aninvestment in upgrading our systems,&quot; Aranow said.andP;  &quot;The increases also haveto do with the growth of the population that we are trying to serve.&quot;andM;Similarly, spending plans at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston will bemaintained at levels comparable to last year's.andM;&quot;The budgets have just gotten approved and I've gotten tons of orders.andP;  Idon't see it letting up at all, and purchases are going up for networkingproducts such as Ethernet Novell,&quot; said Laura Audet, Beth Israel'sinformation center analyst.andM;Audet said many of Beth Israel's purchases will go toward linking Macintoshcomputers to the hospital's mainframe and providing greater Internet accessto hospital users who need to communicate with other hospitals andhealth-care institutions.andM;&quot;At this stage, it's just a trickle of people who want that kind of access,but we see it increasing and expect it to increase even more.&quot;andM;&quot;From what I understand from people who do networking here, the need in thefuture for this kind of connectivity is growing,&quot; Audet said.andP;  &quot;As more andmore people in the hospital hear about it, they all want to get into thegame.&quot;andM;Beth Israel's 1990 spending levels for a user community of 1,100 were about$125,000 per month, mostly for IBM PS/2s and a mixture of 80286 and 80386machines.andP;  Audet said the hospital is considering purchasing more SunMicrosystems workstations and Apple Macintoshes in the coming year.andM;&quot;Apple just announced their newer models, which are cheaper.andP;  That'simportant to a cost-conscious, large institution like this one,&quot; Audet added.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
