In compliancewith the filing requirements of 19 CFR 353.36, petitioner alleges thatimports of drafting machines from Japan are being, or are likely to be,sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning ofsection 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that theseimports materially injure, or threaten material injury to, the U.S. industry.Petitioner has indicated that it has standing to file the petition andthat it is an interested party as defined under section 771(9)(C) of theAct and that it has filed the petition on behalf of the U.S. industry producingthe product that is subject to this investigation. If any interested partyas described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) ofthe Act wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition,please file written notification with the Commerce officials cited in the``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT'' section of this notice.Under our revised regulations, parties seeking exclusion are required tosubmit their requests within 30 days of the date of the publication ofthis notice. The procedures and requirements regarding the filing of suchrequests are contained in 19 CFR 353.14 (54 FR 12773, March 28, 1989).<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price and Foreign Market Value</ITAG>Petitioner's estimate of United States price (USP) is based on the listprices charged by the U.S. sales subsidiary of Mutoh Industries Ltd. (Mutoh)and list prices charged by U.S. wholesalers, less estimated sales discounts.Additional adjustments were made, where appropriate, for U.S. duty, oceanfreight, containerization, U.S. inland freight, insurance, U.S. warehousing,U.S. marketing, and differences in merchandise. Petitioner's estimate offoreign market value (FMV) is based on Mutoh's list prices in Japan, lessan estimated sales discount. Based on a comparison of FMV to USP, petitioneralleges dumping margins ranging from 107 to 144 percent.However, because certain adjustments to USP and FMV were insufficientlysubstantiated, the Department has recalculated these prices. The Department'sestimate of USP is based on the list price of Mutoh's U.S. sales subsidiary,increased by four percent to account for probable price inflation, lesssales discounts and U.S. duty. The Department's estimate of FMV is basedon Mutoh's list prices in Japan, less sales discounts and an adjustmentfor differences in merchandise, where applicable. Based on a comparisonof FMV to USP as estimated by the Department, the petition alleges an averagedumping margin of 73 percent.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initiation of Investigation</ITAG>Under section 732(c) of the Act, we must determine, within 20 days aftera petition is filed, whether it sets forth the allegations necessary forthe initiation of an antidumping duty investigation, and whether it containsinformation reasonably available to the petitioner supporting the allegations.We examined the petition on drafting machines from Japan and found thatit meets the requirements of section 732(b) of the Act. Therefore, in accordancewith section 732 of the Act, we are initiating an antidumping duty investigationto determine whether imports of drafting machines from Japan are being,or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value.If our investigation proceeds normally, we will make our preliminary determinationby September 14, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States had developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule</T3> (HTS), as provided for in section 1201et seq. of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. All merchandiseentered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after thatdate is now classified solely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s).The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes.The written description remains dispositive as to the scope of the productcoverage.Prior to January 1, 1989, such merchandise was classified under item 710.8025of the <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated</T3> (TSUSA). Thismerchandise is currently classifiable under HTS items 9017.10.0000 and9017.90.0000.The scope of this investigation includes drafting machines that are finished,unfinished, assembled, or unassembled, and drafting machine kits. For purposesof this investigation, ``drafting machine'' refers to ``track'' or ``elbow-type''drafting machines used by designers, engineers, architects, layout artists,and others. Drafting machines are devices for aligning scales (or rulers)at a variety of angles anywhere on a drawing surface, generally a draftingboard. A protractor head allows angles to be set and read and lines tobe drawn at this angle. The machine is generally clamped to the board.Both ``track'' and ``elbow-type'' drafting machines are classified underHTS 9017.10.00.Also included within the scope of this investigation are parts of draftingmachines classified under HTS 9017.90.00. Parts include, but are not limitedto, horizontal and vertical tracks, parts of horizontal and vertical tracks,band and pulley mechanisms, parts of band and pulley mechanisms, protractorheads, and parts of protractor heads, destined for use in drafting machines.Accessories, such as parallel rulers, lamps, and scales are not subjectto this investigation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Notification of ITC</ITAG>Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the ITC of this actionand to provide it with the information we used to arrive at this determination.We will notify the ITC and make available to it all nonprivileged and nonproprietaryinformation. We will allow the ITC access to all privileged and businessproprietary information in our files, provided it confirms in writing thatit will not disclose such information either publicly or under administrativeprotective order without the written consent of the Assistant Secretaryfor Import Administration.<ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Determination by ITC</ITAG>The ITC will determine by May 22, 1989, whether there is a reasonable indicationthat imports of drafting machines from Japan materially injure, or threatenmaterial injury to, a U.S. industry. If its determination is negative,the investigation will be terminated; otherwise, it will proceed accordingto the statutory and regulatory procedures.This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="34">April 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Joseph Spetrini,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-10753 Filed 5-4-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3510-DS-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
