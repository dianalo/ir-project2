In its early days itwas overrun by Goths, Huns, Avars, Bulgars, Magyars and Mogols.After that came the Ottoman Turks and later Russians in the role ofprotectors. In World War I, Romania was on the side of the Allies;in World War II it joined the German-led Axis. It fell into theSoviet bloc after that but more recently has asserted anindependence of Moscow, but is in trouble with the West.

Welldressed and determined, they present the picture of a modernsociety going to work.   But a closer look reveals a people struggling, a nation withproblems.   The first clue is the shopping bag; everyone has a shopping bag.   The second clue is in the eyes; the eyes dart from shop windowto shop window, looking for eggs, flour, sugar, bread, cooking oil,meat _ anything on the list of staples in short supply.   In what was once the breadbasket of Europe, Romanians are forcedto live with food rationing, the lack of heat in winter, dimlighting at night, little gasoline for their cars.   They are a nation of privation, the result of President NicolaeCeausescu's economic gambles in 1970s and early 1980s.   Romanians are seeing the fruits of their labors flow into theexport market while they are deprived of imported goods asCeausescu seeks to pay the nation's foreign debt through austerityat home.   Around corners, away from the main streets, people stand inlines that sometimes stretch the length of a block, waiting for adaily ration of bread, or a bottle of milk.   At 6:00 a.m. one recent day, a woman was seen handing bottles ofmilk out of a grating at the side of a shop. The store itself isclosed and dark. The dawn transactions seemed outside officialsanction.   When bread is available, people tote it away by the armfuls,sometimes biting off chunks as they make their way home.   Pedestrians who have managed to find eggs weave precariouslythrough traffic, careful not to break any.   Except in major hotels, the lighting is kept low to saveelectricity. Escalators in department stores have stopped running.   Not long ago things looked much better for Romanians. The nationstill had oil and natural gas, agricultural abundance and a buddingheavy industry. Ceausescu dealt more with the West, which made hima maverick in the Soviet bloc.   Ceausescu's crash economic development stressed energy-intensiveindustries, such as petrochemicals, aluminum and steel. But withdwindling domestic oil reserves, Romania had to rely on imports tofeed huge oil-refining complexes built in the 1960s and the early1970s when oil was cheap.   Romania also had to borrow heavily from the West and by 1981 theforeign debt had reached more than $11 billion.   Ceausescu has never explained his reasoning for pursuing acourse that has brought so much hardship to his 23 million people.   Some Romanians and Western diplomats say it is personal ambition.   Ceausescu has built a personality cult around him unrivaled byother current Soviet-bloc leaders.   Even his East bloc allies criticize him and he has estrangedhimself from the West, which he once courted as it courted him. Heno longer has special trade privileges with the United States.   Romania is drawing more and more into isolation as its peoplestruggle to live from one day to the next.   They face cold winters in badly heated and dimly lit apartmentsbecause of the decline in oil resources _ from an annual productionof 980 million barrels a decade ago to 70 million now.   The use of private cars has been banned four winters in a row.Gasoline is rationed.   People park their cars in lines at gas stations, even thoughthey are closed, to be ready for the next delivery of gasoline.   The bright spring in Romania, with flowers in full bloom, peoplecarrying fresh bouquets, and women chicly dressed in Westernstyles, hides the strains of a hard winter just past, the dailystruggle for food and the lack of freedom of information and ofspeech.   Public dissent is muted, due to what Western diplomats call``the Romanian character'' (Romanians have seldom revolted) and toan effective ``repressive apparatus.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
