He cites horrendousfigures such as a recent Department of Trade and Industry report which saidthat #1m an hour in the UK is lost through software designs collapsing inpractice.andP;  According to Fagan, Compuware has much to gain from the situation.andO;It has been taking software testing, as a co-ordinated concept, seriously forsome time, and the company believes it has now come up with a product thatwill make the idea a reality.andP;  Compuware Ltd is an American company based inMichigan, Detroit, with a turnover of $130m a year.andP;  The company has threeoperations: arms, professional services, systems software and educationalresources, but its major revenue is generated from systems software.andO;Historically, says Fagan, software testing has been a rather piecemeal affairwith designers developing software solutions to testing problems after theyoccured.andP;  This has resulted in a lack of structure for testing and, saysFagan, fragmented product ranges, both in terms of what a company can buyfrom one supplier and in terms of what the products do and how they interact.andO;Compuware claims to offer the broadest range of testing tools in the IBMmainframe environment, covering what Fagan defines as the four main areas ofsoftware testing: fault diagnosis, interactive debugging, data manipulationand simulation.andP;  He describes the company as a niche player in those fourdifferent areas, and believes that by remaining in a particular market theystay close to customer requirements and can therefore come up with theproducts people need.andP;  Within the next three months Compuware will belaunching Command Centre, which will, claims the company, make structuredsoftware testing a reality.andP;  The Command Centre links all Compuware productstogether and enables them to talk to each other intelligently.andP;  There will befull function interchange between the products and the decision making willbe done en route between them.andP;  They aim to provide integration on allaspects of software testing, ensuring that the testing of code is as thoroughas its development.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
