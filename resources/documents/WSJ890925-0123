A furor arose over the plant late last year when the U.S. said it had evidence the factory was about to produce chemical weapons. Switzerland's investigation was touched off by a West German prosecutor's request to probe links of Swiss companies to the project.    Several Swiss companies did provide financing and equipment for the plant, the prosecutor's office said. But it said the companies didn't violate laws that bar military exports to areas of conflict or crisis.    The prosecutor's office said it was dropping its investigation.    NOBEL CONTROVERSY    Two members of the Nobel Literature Prize selection committee quit over the body's refusal to speak out against threats to British author Salman Rushdie, and a third quit over an undisclosed matter, but the committee is refusing to let them go. The two quitting over the Rushdie matter were novelists Kerstin Ekman and Lars Gyllensten; the other resigning member was poet Werner Aspenstrom. But Sture Allen, chairman of the Sweden's Academy of Letters, said: &quot;Members serve for life so we cannot grant their resignation requests.&quot;    DUTCH EXHIBITION    Van Gogh may have died broke, but the Netherlands has budgeted $12.5 million for an exhibition of his paintings to mark the 100th anniversary of his death next year. The exhibit will fill two museums and will include some 40 oil paintings and 120 sketches from abroad. &quot;It is probably the last time these works will be brought together, because it is complicated to bring them together and traveling is not good for paintings,&quot; said Frits Becht, managing director of the Van Gogh 1990 Foundation.    PERUVIAN DEBT    Peru's news agency quoted President Alan Garcia as saying his country would be willing to lift its four-year-old halt on debt payments to the International Monetary Fund if Peru received large new loans. President Garcia reportedly said Peru could resume interest payments if it won a $500 million standby loan plus an $800 million bridging loan to cover its debts to the IMF. Later, in Lima, armed critics of the IMF invaded the offices of Agence France-Presse and United Press International but left after painting slogans on the walls.    CYPRIOT 'INDUSTRY'    &quot;I don't want to say it's an industry, but almost,&quot; said Tamar Leshem, head of Tel Aviv's independent Office for Human Rights. The almost-industry: Israeli couples traveling by plane or ship to Cyprus to be united by civil marriage. The reason: In Israel, marriages may be performed only by religious authorities -- Jewish, Moslem, Christian or Druse -- and not everybody likes that idea. In Cyprus's capital of Nicosia, Deputy Mayor C.S. Christopoulos estimated he has married Israelis at some 230 civil weddings over the past three years.    ERITREAN DROUGHT    Long in the throes of armed conflict, Eritrea is once again coming to grips with another woe: drought. Having received only 20% of expected rainfall in June and July, the northern province of Ethiopia now is seeing a major failure of its current crops. Preliminary estimates by the Eritrean Relief Association indicate that 1.6 million people in the province will need 359,000 metric tons of emergency food to ward off famine over the coming year.    EUROPE'S ELECTRIC CARS    A growing number of Europeans see the electric car as the vehicle of the future -- if major problems can be resolved.    &quot;We aim to introduce several million electric-driven cars by the end of this century,&quot; European Community Transport Commissioner Karel van Miert said while attending a seminar of electric-transport experts in Bruges, Belgium.    Fans of electric cars say they are clean, quiet and economical. A disadvantage, said David Porter of Britain's Central Electricity Generating Board, is &quot;their range, which is typically only 40 miles. After that, they must be recharged for eight hours.&quot; Another drawback is that they cost more to build than gasoline-powered cars.    Gaston Maggetto, professor of electrical engineering at the Flemish Free University in Brussels, said the way to get the cost down is &quot;political action, because the pollution-free aspect of the electric car is an advantage to the whole community, not to the individual.&quot;    POSTSCRIPTS . . .    South African censors relaxed a three-year ban on a biography of jailed black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela. Mary Benson's &quot;Nelson Mandela,&quot; censored immediately after publication in 1986, will be available for study at university libraries but still can't be released for purchase or lending. . . . Korea's government-owned phone company told National Assembly investigators it made an additional $59.7 million over the past seven years from its pay phones that don't return change. </TEXT></DOC>
