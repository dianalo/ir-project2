Environmental groups want Congress to revise 26-year-oldpolicies that govern concessionaires. Under long-termcontracts with the National Park Service, most of thesebusinesses have become highly profitable monopolies. Thevolume of park visitors has tripled since 1964, spurring hugeincreases in demand for conveniences. Annual concessionrevenues now exceed $500 million.   Critics fear the continuing growth of these businessesthreatens the character of natural treasures and cheapens theexperience for visitors. They cite enlarged parking lots, newfast-food outlets, information centers converted to giftshops, overtaxed sewage systems and mounting problems withtrash disposal. Others worry about aggressive expansion ofriver-floating businesses and the proliferation of tackysouvenirs, such as toilet seats embossed with park names.   The Wilderness Society argues that current concessionoperations damage park resources. For similar reasons, theNational Parks and Conservation Association opposesdevelopment plans for the Grand Canyon's North Rim andconstruction of a 60-unit lodging complex at Crater Lake,Oregon.   U.S. Rep. Mike Synar, an Oklahoma Democrat, argues thatconcessionaire contracts last too long, that rents and feescollected by the government are far too low and that currentcontractors get unfair preference for renewal. He hasintroduced a bill to standardize park concession fees at22.5% of gross receipts, instead of the current average of2.5%. Other changes could encourage open competition forconcession contracts. As a result, the kinds of goods andservices available in the parks could change significantly.About 40 contracts are due for renewal this year, and 60 morewill be considered by 1994.   In Yosemite National Park, Matsushita ElectricIndustrial's Curry Co. unit operates lodges, restaurants andmany other businesses. Curry has been under scrutiny becauseits 30-year contract, which expires in 1993, requires thecompany to return only 75 cents to the government for every$100 of Yosemite receipts. Critics also question theappropriateness of several Curry operations, includingwine-tasting festivals and ice cream stands.   Naturalist John Muir called Yosemite &quot;the most divinelybeautiful and sublime&quot; place he ever saw. But as a result ofconcession contracts, Rep. Synar notes, it's also a placewhere visitors can buy pizza, get haircuts, rent movies and&quot;have your photos developed in one hour.&quot;                                                                                                          Cancers Put Fiberglass   Under the Microscope                                                                                                          COULD fiberglass become the asbestos of the 1990s?   The Labor Department has decided to require allglass-fiber products, including insulation, to carrycarcinogen warning labels.   Gerald F. Scannell, assistant secretary for OccupationalSafety and Health, says the decision stems from a governmentreview of several medical studies that showed &quot;astatistically significant increase&quot; in respiratory-tractcancer among fiberglass production workers.   In California, legislation has been introduced to ban theproduction, sale and installation of blown-in fiberglassinsulation. Sponsors of the measure say glass fibers aresimilar in physical structure to asbestos fibers and thuspose similar health threats.   Dick Rauscher, executive director of the ThermalInsulation Manufacturers Association, says the industry hasspent $12 million on fiberglass health tests and won't needto &quot;do anything differently now.&quot; Since 1988, Owens-CorningFiberglas and Manville have voluntarily put cancer-warninglabels on their products that cite &quot;studies of laboratoryanimals.&quot; But effective July 1, both companies will drop thatphrase. Manville's revised labels also will say, &quot;Possiblecancer hazard by inhalation.&quot;                                                                                                          Recycling Programs   Roll Across the Land                                                                                                          MUNICIPAL recycling efforts are spreading and becomingmore elaborate. BioCycle magazine estimates that the numberof curbside collection programs nearly tripled to more than2,800 last year from 1,050 in 1988.   Among 163 U.S. cities that applied for the Heinz NationalRecycling Awards this spring, two-thirds have implementedprograms within the past three years. Almost a fifth of themare less than a year old.   The competition, organized by the H.J. Heinz Co.Foundation and the U.S. Conference of Mayors, also showedthat 87% of the cities now offer curbside collection andtwo-thirds collect from apartment buildings. Despite suchefforts, most of these cities still send at leastthree-fourths of their trash to landfills. Waste-disposalfees range from $5 a ton in Jackson, Tenn., to $161 inPhiladelphia.   Many programs now go beyond conventional items to includesuch troublesome materials as batteries, motor oil,antifreeze and paint. Ann Arbor, Mich., recycles tonercartridges from laser printers. Clifton, N.J., takes ontires, concrete and asphalt.   Minneapolis, a Heinz award winner, adds a solid-waste feeto monthly utility bills to make residents aware of disposalcosts. Households that recycle get a $7 discount.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          PENCILS that contain no rain-forest wood and that aren'tcoated with lacquer or varnish are being promoted asenvironmentally sound by Faber/Castell. . . . Martin Mariettawill build a $3 million robot called TRex, controlled througha fiberoptic link, that will handle hazardous wastes at agovernment site in Idaho Falls, Idaho.</TEXT></DOC>
