Estimates of mean reservoir energy of over 455 x 10{sup18} J have been made by Mabey in 1983, and energy offset of over 26 MWthermal were made by Bloomquist et al in 1985. These low-temperature(andless; 150{sup 0}C, hydrothermal resources are presently being used for commercialand domestic space heating and aquaculture. The thermal waters are generallyhigh in F and NaHCO{sub 3} constituents, but have low concentrationsof dissolved solids. Consequently, most developers use the resource directly,without pretreatment. In general, the resource is associated with theTertiary Idavada Volcanics, a series of rhyolites and ash flow tuffs.Circulation of the thermal waters is controlled by faults, joints, andfractures. Temperatures range from 30{sup 0} to 70{sup 0}C, and welldepths range from 800 to 3000 ft. Most flowing wells have high yields(2000 gpm) and shut-in pressures (250 psi).</TEXT></DOC>
