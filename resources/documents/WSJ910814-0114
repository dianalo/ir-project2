Mr. Taylor, 52 years old, would succeed William Seidman,whose term ends on Oct. 16. The nomination requires Senateconfirmation.</LP><TEXT>   President Bush first mentioned Mr. Taylor as a candidatefor the FDIC job more than a year ago. Last week, after Mr.Seidman announced his resignation plans, the White Housedelayed naming Mr. Taylor until officials assured themselvesthat Mr. Taylor won't be hurt by unfolding disclosures aboutthe Bank of Credit andamp; Commerce International. Mr. Taylor hasbeen leading the Fed's efforts to police BCCI, and some inCongress have criticized the agency for being too slow.   Banking industry officials praised the selection of Mr.Taylor. &quot;During the past decade, the banking industry hasfound Mr. Taylor to be a tough but fair regulator,&quot; saidRichard Kirk, president of the American Bankers Association.   Mr. Taylor would take over the FDIC at a challenging time.The recent rash of bank failures has almost drained the bankdeposit insurance fund. Congress is about to expand theFDIC's borrowing authority by $70 billion and impose new lawsfor regulating banks. In addition, the FDIC is engaged inefforts to attract private investors to help recapitalizefailing banks.</TEXT></DOC>
