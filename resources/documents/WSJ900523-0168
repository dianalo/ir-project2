He is to appear before the House BankingCommittee to testify about his role as a director ofSilverado Banking, Savings andamp; Loan Association.   Mr. Bush didn't gain directly from the transactions but,as a director, he approved loans to his outside businessassociates. In at least one case, Mr. Bush didn't disclose onfinancial forms that he had a business relationship with aborrower, whose $106 million in Silverado transactionseventually soured. Thrift regulators are pursuing anadministrative action against Mr. Bush, which he iscontesting.</LP><TEXT>   Silverado differed from other big thrift failures,regulators said. For example, compared with Lincoln Savings andamp;Loan Association, Irvine, Calif., and CenTrust Savings,Miami, whose failures may end up costing taxpayers twice asmuch, Silverado's records and underwriting were morecomplete. And it was less combative with regulators thanother more high-flying Sandamp;Ls.   But regulators accuse Silverado, whose losses could total$1 billion, of requiring borrowers to also become Silveradoinvestors by tying Silverado loans to the purchase ofSilverado preferred stock that the thrift could count towardcapital. It also inflated appraisals and granted preferentialloans to officers, not including Mr. Bush. It also hid lossesby selling pieces of a loan pool to borrowers, who tookmillions in Silverado's losses, which violates accountingrules.   &quot;Much of Silverado's high-flying was in the samestratosphere with the Lincolns and the CenTrusts, but theDenver thrift wins the title for the most creativeself-financing mechanisms,&quot; said Rep. Henry Gonzalez, (D.,Texas), chairman of the committee.   As previously disclosed, JNB Exploration, Mr. Bush'senergy company, had oil and gas deals with two of Silverado'smajor borrowers, real-estate developers Kenneth Good and BillWalters. Although Mr. Bush didn't vote to approve Silveradoloans to Mr. Good, in 1986 he did approve $106 million inloans and other transactions to Mr. Walters.   So far, thrift regulators said they have made 11 referralsof criminal activity to the Justice Department for possiblelegal action. They declined yesterday to identify the partiesinvolved or the actions that are the subject of thereferrals.   Five former directors and officers of Silverado havesigned consent agreements barring them from working in thefinancial industry without receiving permission fromregulators.   Mr. Bush, asserting he did nothing wrong, refused to signa consent agreement in January, and the matter is beingpursued in an administrative proceeding. That action wouldprohibit Mr. Bush from engaging in similar lending agreementsif he were to serve on the board of any financial institutionin the future. At that time, Mr. Bush also said that hedidn't benefit directly or indirectly from the loans to Mr.Walters.   The banking committee also said it plans to issue asubpoena to Kermit Mowbray, former president of the FederalHome Loan Bank of Topeka, Kan., who declined to appearyesterday.   The committee, which asked Mr. Mowbray to testify, said itwants to ask him why, as the top regional regulator, hewaited weeks after a staff recommendation to seize theinstitution -- until after the 1988 presidential election.   Federal regulators said yesterday that hundreds of ailingthrifts were being seized during late 1988, and that theelection and the presence of Neil Bush on the Silveradoboard, didn't influence the timing of Silverado's takeover.   In December 1988, Silverado was sold to First NationwideBank, the thrift subsidiary of Ford Motor Co.</TEXT></DOC>
