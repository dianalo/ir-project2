Banxquote Online, a New York-based information service, said the average yield for 30-day retail CDs jumped to 6.06% from 5.99% the week before.    &quot;Before the summer holidays, a lot of people need a little extra cash for vacations and withdraw more funds from banks,&quot; said Norberto Mehl, president of Banxquote Online. &quot;So banks have to increase rates to keep deposit levels constant.&quot;    Yields for longer-term CDs posted more moderate increases. The average six-month CD rose to 6.82%, from 6.80% the week before, while the 2 1/2-year and five-year CD rates both rose one basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point, to 7.51% and 8.08%, respectively. The average one-year CD yield, meantime, was unchanged at 7.25%.    The average yield for money-market accounts also was unchanged at 5.56%.    These bank accounts compete with money-market mutual funds, whose average seven-day compounded yield rose to 6.78% in the week ended Tuesday from 6.71% a week earlier, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter. The average 30-day yield for these money funds rose to 6.67% from 6.59% and the average maturity of funds fell to 36 days from 37 days.    The average maturity figure, the lowest since the first week of the year, means that money-market portfolio managers still expect interest rates to rise, said Cyndi Andrade, Donoghue editorial manager. </TEXT></DOC>
