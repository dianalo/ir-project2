Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts to the Democratic NationalConvention on Tuesday.   Thank you, John for that moving introduction, and for the joyyou have given our family over the years. Tonight, you have givensomething special to this convention and this country. You havetouched deep chords of memory and hope in Democrats and Americanseverywhere. You remind us that we are at our best when we have apresident who asks each of us what we can do for our country.   For a long time, I have believed that what this country needs isanother president from Massachusetts. And now it's going to happen.   President Dukakis _ it has a nice ring, doesn't it.   Some people say _ don't count your chickens before they'rehatched. Well, the Republicans have already hatched their chickenin this campaign _ and George Bush is a dead duck.   And that doesn't even count all the other chickens they'vehatched in the past eight years that are coming home to roost onelection day this November.   We know who and what we are running against. We know them bytheir names and by their deeds. They are the party of Ed Meese andRobert Bork. They are the party of Irangate, Contra-gate,Pentagon-gate. They are the party that tolerates apartheid abroadand retreats from civil rights here at home.   They are the party that talks tough on drugs but deals softlywith drug-running dictators. We have heard the slogan _ ``Just sayno.'' The problem is _ our Republican opponents just couldn't say``no'' to General Noriega.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
