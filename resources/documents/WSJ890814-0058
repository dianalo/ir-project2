Why file in Missouri? Mr. Schaden says he can keep the suit in that state's court because it's the home of one of the defendants, McDonnell Douglas Corp., which built the plane. Had Mr. Schaden filed in Colorado, where none of the defendants is based, defense lawyers could have moved the case to federal court because the parties are from different states.    Philip Corboy, a plaintiff attorney in Chicago, used the same strategy in filing his first four lawsuits in state courts in Chicago, home of UAL Corp., parent of United.    Aside from their distrust of the judges, plaintiffs' lawyers generally don't like federal court because of the way related cases are consolidated in a single court, regardless of where the plaintiffs are based. Such multi-district litigation is generally handled by a committee of lawyers, meaning individual lawyers can lose control of their own case -- and their fees.    For defense lawyers, federal courts are preferable precisely because the cases are consolidated. Lawyers for McDonnell Douglas and co-defendant General Electric Co. said a single judge is better able to control a case, and pre-trial fact-finding can be done more efficiently with a group of plaintiffs rather than one by one.    Police Chiefs Speak Out    On Crime, Gun Control    POLICE CHIEFS most everywhere agree that courts are way too soft on criminals, the death penalty makes a lot of sense, and citizens should be allowed to bear arms.    So says a survey of the National Association of Chiefs of Police. The results present a picture of how 2,549 commanding officers see the issues, at least as measured by some rather leading questions.    With a question that had certain words emphasized, the association got an overwhelming &quot;yes&quot; from 86% of the officers when it asked: &quot;Do you feel that the system of criminal justice has broken down to the point where it is the inability to deal with criminals caught by the police (prosecution and imprisonment) that is the major cause of crime in America?&quot;    Regarding the death penalty, 94% of the respondents said capital punishment serves as a deterrent to certain types of crimes, and 95% said they favored a three-year limit on appeals after a death penalty has been assessed. Currently, most executions are delayed for many years by multiple appeals.    Some 90% of the respondents said that banning shotguns and rifles wouldn't reduce the ability of criminals to get such weapons. And 86% agreed that &quot;for the sake of the defense of the U.S. . . . citizens should be allowed to have their own rifles, shotguns and handguns for emergencies natural or man-made.&quot;    In a follow-up question, the association asked, &quot;Do you think that the media that depicts violence especially over TV, while at the same time encourages the banning of firearms by law abiding citizens for sport or self-defense, is hypocritical?&quot; Almost 90% of the officers said &quot;yes.&quot;    Tickets in Their Pockets    Are Blamed on Dockets    MUNICIPAL COURT officials in Houston got fed up with the scofflaws who were ignoring 462,000 city parking tickets, so they took the unusual step of issuing arrest warrants for the top 100 offenders.    Trouble is, 41 of the top 100 appear to be well-equipped to defend themselves: They list their occupation as &quot;lawyer.&quot;    Municipal court director Donald Hollingsworth suggested that lawyers may draw more tickets because they park outside the county courthouse, an opinion backed by Jim Lavine, president of the Harris County Criminal Lawyers Association.    &quot;A lot of it has to do with the incredibly increased dockets in the courts,&quot; Mr. Lavine says, tallying the parking spaces required for jurors, lawyers, witnesses, defendants and their families. &quot;We just flat ain't got room for them,&quot; he says.    Each of the top 100 offenders had accumulated 30 or more parking tickets over the past five years. First on the list was -- you guessed it -- a lawyer, with a whopping 258 tickets.    Freedom From Religion    Is All the Inmate Asks    AN INMATE of the state prison in Grady, Ark., has filed suit claiming cruel and unusual punishment and violations of his First Amendment rights to freedom of religion. His gripe? The only television program shown during daily free time consists of videotapes of chapel services.    &quot;Essentially, for five hours a day, five days a week -- and some for the rest of their lives -- they have to watch this chapel channel,&quot; says the inmate's lawyer, Chad Farris. &quot;I went to a Southern Baptist college, a Catholic law school, and I'm a Presbyterian now, but I can't imagine dealing with that kind of relentless programming.&quot;    There's a reprieve, at least for now: The prison warden has voluntarily suspended the program while the state considers its response to the suit, says Assistant Attorney General Leslie Powell. </TEXT></DOC>
