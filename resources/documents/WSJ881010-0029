It momentarily upstaged the takeover mania that has dominated the market for many months.    Friday's unemployment and payroll statistics for September, released at 8:30 a.m. EDT indicated the economy wasn't growing too fast. That sent bond prices up about a point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount of bonds, by the time the stock market opened at 9:30.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened 15 points higher, with steady gains through the day enhanced by several waves of buy programs related to stock-index arbitrage. The Dow closed 42.50 points higher at 2150.25 -- just below the post-crash high of 2158.60 on July 5.    But Friday's fireworks were the exception, not the rule, of the stock market recently. Most other days, without the huge pool of speculative capital that is chasing takeover stocks, there would be &quot;a far less liquid market than the one we have,&quot; contends Guy P. Wyser-Pratte, the cerebral Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. executive vice president who is the dean of Wall Street's risk arbitragers.    &quot;I'd estimate that approximately 20% of the volume in the stock market these days is directly related to takeovers and restructuring transactions,&quot; Mr. Wyser-Pratte says. That suggests takeover-stock plays are accounting for about twice as large a percentage of New York Stock Exchange volume as program trading.    The current restructuring and takeover &quot;craze,&quot; as the Prudential-Bache arbitrager calls it, is part of &quot;a normal and necessary capital reorganization that will have to occur if U.S. businesses expect to compete effectively in world markets after 1992,&quot; when the European Community is scheduled to be fully integrated. &quot;Some American companies are going to have to gear up and others will have to slim down to compete,&quot; Mr. Wyser-Pratte adds, &quot;so the broad restructuring will have to continue.&quot;    What that craze is doing for the psyches -- and wallets -- of Wall Street's arbitragers is wondrous to behold. &quot;Last year at this time I was tracking maybe four or five takeover plays and investing in just a couple,&quot; one independent arbitrager said the other day. &quot;Now I'm tracking 28 stocks on my monitor screen and I own a dozen of them.&quot;    To some, the craze has some of the frenetic feeling of a rowdy fraternity party: At any moment, it seems, things could start getting broken. Even the arbitragers concede that feeling may be justified.    Typically far more heavily leveraged than other market players, the arbitragers rely on firm or rising prices of the stocks they hold to keep margin clerks at bay. If prices plunge -- as they quickly do when a pending takeover or restructuring deal meets an unexpected obstacle -- the arbitragers are subject to forced liquidations. If they choose to tough it out and hold the plunging stock, they must shed some of their other stock positions. With $15 billion of such highly leveraged hot money in the market, such selling can quickly snowball.    These days there's another unnerving risk factor in the arbitragers' world -- the imminent presidential election. Highly emotional by nature, many of them now are privately confiding that they fear a major market sell-off should Democrat Michael Dukakis upset front-runner George Bush.    &quot;If Dukakis wins, you have to look at who are the major corporate influences on him,&quot; says the top arbitrager at one major Wall Street firm. &quot;My firm doesn't want me to say this, but Massachusetts companies like Polaroid and Gillette, whose managements are death on takeovers, would be screaming for anti-takeover initiatives within 10 minutes after a Dukakis victory. If Dukakis wins, this market's going to crash,&quot; he predicts.    Overstated? Perhaps. But the last time the arbitragers got really upset was Oct. 13, 1987, as they reacted to news of a proposed anti-takeover measure in the House Ways and Means Committee. And their selling of deal stocks that began the next morning led directly to Black Monday.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   The market surge came on hefty volume of 216.4 million shares. Institutional buyers finally were persuaded to commit some of their accumulating cash hoards to stocks.    The labor statistics that stirred their enthusiasm showed a modest drop in unemployment last month and growth of U.S. non-farm payrolls by 255,000 jobs, about 30,000 fewer than widely predicted. Economists saw the data as a sign that the country's economic growth might be slowing -- indicating lower inflation and thus less pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.    Broader market measures kept pace with the Dow's rise. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock Index surged 5.68 to 278.07 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 2.88 to 156.81. Advancers overwhelmed decliners on the Big Board, 1,140 to 399.    For the week, the Dow industrials posted a 37.29-point gain, or 1.76%. The Sandamp;P 500 gained 2.26% in the week, and the NYSE index rose 2.1%.    Among standout gainers, Seagram added 1 3/4 to 57 5/8 on a report in Friday's Journal that it is expected to enforce a sweeping restructuring that will trim possibly as many as 40% of its roughly 5,000 U.S. alcoholic-beverage employees.    Dow Chemical advanced 1 1/4 to 90 3/4. Several Wall Street firms expressed enthusiasm for the company following a Thursday appearance of Frank Popoff, chief executive officer, before a New York analysts group.    Hospital Corp. of America added 7/8 to 44 1/4, following Thursday's 1 1/4 gain. The company said late Thursday that a special committee of its board had rejected a leveraged buy-out proposal of about $47 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
