John Glenn, D-Ohio, sat confidently as his attorney told thecommittee: &quot;Sen. Glenn does not want to skate by here. . . . He wants you totest him by the toughest ethical standards you can devise for yourself andyour colleagues and him. And he meets that standard.&quot;;    DeConcini forhimself;  Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., looked discouraged and weary as hisattorney tried to repair the damage the senator received a day earlier, whenthe committee's special counsel indicated Riegle had deliberately lied to thecommittee.;    Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., launched his own fiery defense,insisting: &quot;It was not a single constituent, a single person that this senatorintervened for. It was a major employer of 2,000 people with a payroll of $50million a year.&quot;;    Sen. John McCain's attorney, brimming with confidencethat his client will be cleared, insisted that the ethics committee give theArizona Republican &quot;a straight, clear, crisp finding, based on the evidence.&quot;;   And the attorney for Sen. Alan Cranston, who is undergoing cancer treatmentin the Bay Area, told of how the Keating affair has deeply wounded the76-year-old Democrat, who has already announced he will not run forre-election next year.;    &quot;After one of the finest careers in public serviceof any man or woman in this country, after standing up for peace and justice .. . now in the twilight of his career, Alan Cranston must face the accusation,whether expressed or implied, that he became Charles Keating's marionette,&quot;said Cranston's attorney, William Taylor. &quot;That, members of the committee, ispreposterous.&quot;;    The exhaustive nine-week hearings -- the longest suchpublic case in Senate history -- focused on a list of separate ethicalquestions, most of them related to how far a senator can go in doing favorsfor a major campaign contributor.;    Keating funneled $1.3 million to thecampaigns or causes of the five senators, at least in part because he wantedtheir support in his bitter battle with savings and loan regulators. In 1989,Keating's Southern California thrift was finally seized, sticking taxpayerswith a bailout bill of at least $2.3 billion. Keating is under indictment onfelony fraud charges.;    While there is no question that the five senatorsmet with Sandamp;L regulators at Keating's request, the committee heard virtually notestimony that &quot;pressure&quot; from those five senators was ever responsible forkeeping the renegade institution open and racking up huge losses.;   Expensive perception; &quot;The common public perception that these five senators,by simply meeting with the regulators, cost taxpayers $2 billion is simply notaccurate,&quot; said Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., vice chairman of the committee.;   The committee investigated whether the senators acted because Keating wasgiving them money. Also investigated was whether the senators helped Keatingat the time he was giving them money. All five senators insist there was nolink between Keating's money and their actions.;    The committee will decidethe case in private, and begin deliberations Jan. 30. It could vote to clearany of the senators, which several committee members indicate they intend todo for Glenn and McCain. The other three senators more likely face punishmentranging from a letter of reprimand to censure on the Senate floor, or, farmore unlikely, expulsion from the Senate.; In their defense; From the finalarguments for the five senators:; (box)John Glenn: &quot;He wants you to test himby the toughest ethical standards . . . and he meets that standard.&quot;;(box)John McCain: &quot;He has been judged not by his conduct but by the conduct ofothers.&quot;; (box)Donald Riegle: &quot;He had less contact with the regulators thanany other senator in this case.&quot;; (box)Dennis DeConcini: &quot;It was not . . . asingle person that this senator intervened for. It was a major employer of2,000 people.&quot;; (box)Alan Cranston: &quot;Now in the twilight of his career, (he)must face the accusation . . . that he became Charles Keating's marionette.That, members of the committee, is preposterous.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  TOM WEBB, Mercury News Washington Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910117  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  16A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  740  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday January 17, 199100017171,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
