The auction house announced the decision Wednesday, saying thenew policy would apply to Sotheby's 17 auction centers and 44offices worldwide.   ``This is very much of a corporate statement that we support thegroups that are trying to stop this slaughter and this atrocity,''said Michael Ainslie, Sotheby's president and chief executiveofficer.   The move followed a large advertisement placed in The New YorkTimes by Friends of Animals, of Norwalk, Conn., decrying thescheduled auction Friday of two African elephant tusks for anestimated $12,000 to $16,000.   The ad, which ran Wednesday, said nearly 1 million elephants, orthree-fourths of Africa's wild elephant population, have been wipedout since 1979.   The tusks in question were legally acquired before 1976, saidAinslie.   ``Nonetheless, we are very much aware that, lawsnotwithstanding, the visibility of such a sale does have thepotential to induce more destruction,'' said Ainslie. ``The sellerhas decided on our strong recommendation to remove them from thesale.''   Later Wednesday, Sotheby's bought the tusks from theunidentified seller for an undisclosed sum. They will be donated``to an appropriate institution or museum,'' said a spokeswoman,Diana Levitt.   ``We're thrilled,'' said Priscilla Feral, president of Friendsof Animals. ``Now, we're going to ask them to firm up the decisionby refusing to deal in any ivory regardless of the age.''   Ainslie said Sotheby's consulted with the African WildlifeFoundation before making its decision, which will affect a verysmall portion of its profits.   Ms. Feral said her group also would ask the competing Christie'sauction house to follow Sotheby's example.   Christie's spokeswoman Roberta Meneker said, ``Generallyspeaking, we do not intend to sell ivory. But we can't make acategorical statement.''   She said a distinction should be drawn between modern ivorypieces and ``an 18th-century tusk that comes from England orFrance.''</TEXT></DOC>
