But should the market surge   I experience no change:   My feelings are the same --   Just at a higher range.    --Joshua Adams.    ---   The Definitive Distress   A wolf's howl, the roar from a bear,   A wildcat's scream and a bull moose's bawl   Can cause alarm but can't compare   To one's first jolting margin call!    --Bert H. Kruse.    ---   Music Update   Now there's a televangelists' song: Praise the Lord and Pass the Contribution!    --Shelby Friedman. </TEXT></DOC>
