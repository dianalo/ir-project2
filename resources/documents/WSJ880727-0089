In December, the troubled banking concern, based in North Palm Beach, Fla., was ordered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to increase its regulatory capital to 8% of total assets by July 30.    First American said it increased the bank's capital, by among other things, selling $6 million of common stock in a private placement with certain directors and other investors and selling $4.2 million of capital notes.    The bank said it will submit a plan soon to the FDIC for raising the remainder of the capital. First American said it has letters of intent to sell its Brevard County branches as well as a shopping center to two different institutions. The proceeds will increase the bank's regulatory capital &quot;substantially&quot; and bring it near its &quot;goal to meet the FDIC guidelines.&quot;    An FDIC spokesman refused to comment.    Yesterday, in national over-the-counter trading, First American closed at $4.875, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
