So they wouldn't be too surprised to hear how he spent his Sunday after accepting the biggest bankruptcy-law case in the nation's history.    Shortly before noon, Texaco Inc.'s lawyers arrived at his home in the wealthy suburb of Larchmont, N.Y., to initiate the filing. The proceedings took all of 45 minutes. When the grim delegation departed, &quot;I went back to the Sunday papers,&quot; Judge Schwartzberg recalls. &quot;Later, I watched the Mets game, and that evening I visited my daughter at her home.&quot;    The judge's calmness seems likely to serve him well as he shepherds the historic case through bankruptcy court. But the demands of the case already are putting him to the test. Shortly after he arrived at work yesterday, his telephone began ringing as shareholders, creditors and reporters sought his comments on the proceeding.    &quot;There was nothing we could do to prepare for the case,&quot; the judge said yesterday in an interview. &quot;We shuddered to think of it. We were somewhat unprepared for something of this size, but we are quickly taking stock of what we'll need to handle it.&quot;    Texaco's case could easily overwhelm the tiny courthouse in White Plains, N.Y. -- part of the Southern District of New York -- where Judge Schwartzberg sits. Indeed, after hours of copying documents yesterday, the courthouse's only public copier broke down, infuriating those who had lined up to use the machine.    Charles L. Brieant, chief judge of the Southern District who sits in White Plains, said there was &quot;no chance&quot; the bankruptcy case would be transferred to the larger courthouse in Manhattan. &quot;Texaco's home office is right here&quot; in White Plains, he said, &quot;and the case belongs here.&quot;    So for Judge Schwartzberg, the practical considerations of finding space for files and people to do the filing are a top priority. &quot;We will have to add more copying machines, more telephone lines, more clerical staff,&quot; he said. &quot;We'll have to determine whether the building has sufficient power and space to handle the case.&quot;    He shrugged off the possibility that the case could consume all his time. Indeed, the judge said he was planning to leave early yesterday to observe the Jewish holiday of Passover. &quot;The avalanche of case work hasn't hit me yet,&quot; he said. In fact, he added, &quot;the case may not be as time-consuming as it might appear. It is basically a two-party shoot-out. There aren't any banks foreclosing or any creditors running after Texaco.&quot;    Texaco's case could get complicated very quickly, though. Bankruptcy-law experts said Pennzoil may challenge Texaco's court shelter. In addition, there typically are a lot of squabbles among creditors in such big corporate reorganizations.    &quot;The case may appear easy now because none of the (creditor) groups have organized yet,&quot; George Hahn, a bankruptcy lawyer in New York, said. &quot;But these groups are going to get organized . . . (and) the battle of the titans, Texaco and Pennzoil, may be only one ring in a 10-ring circus.&quot;    Judge Schwartzberg is highly regarded by bankruptcy lawyers for his prompt and scholarly opinions. A 1953 graduate of New York University Law School, he worked for a small firm on Wall Street, then joined a chemical concern as its general counsel. Before being appointed to the bench in 1971, he was general counsel for a small textile concern, M. Lowenstein andamp; Sons in New York. He is the senior bankruptcy judge in terms of tenure on the Second Circuit.    Judge Schwartzberg, whose opinions are rarely overturned by higher courts, is considered an expert in corporate reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. Still, big corporate bankruptcy-law proceedings are rare in his courthouse. Like many bankruptcy courts, his is dominated by personal bankruptcies, typically those of financially troubled homeowners fending off bank foreclosure.    Two of the largest cases he has handled were the liquidation of Westchester Premier Theater and the reorganization of Kevin Steel Corp. Those cases were filed in the mid-1970s.    &quot;He's got a wealth of experience and savvy, though he hasn't had as many of the big cases as the judges (sitting) in New York,&quot; said Frank Kennedy, a bankruptcy-law expert at the University of Michigan Law School in Ann Arbor. &quot;But he's had a good sprinkling of cases. Very few judges have experience with cases this big. You basically learn on the job.&quot;    Judge Schwartzberg already has learned one thing: There's no room for levity in the Texaco bankruptcy-law case. On Sunday, after the company's lawyers delivered the foot-high filing to his home, which overlooks a golf course, the judge tried to lighten the group's black mood with a joke. &quot;I suggested that it would be a lot more pleasant if they had Bob Hope, who does commercials for Texaco, and Arnold Palmer, who represents Pennzoil Co., settle this dispute on the golf course,&quot; the judge recalls.    No one laughed. </TEXT></DOC>
