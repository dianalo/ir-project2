The red phone is a CEO hot line whose number isgiven to all Auspex customers, as are the regular numbers of Boucher and allAuspex's vice presidents.;   The company makes servers, which are computersthat help personal computer networks operate. It shipped its first product inFebruary 1990, and sales are running at a $30 million-a-year pace.;   Customersatisfaction isn't an unusual corporate goal. But few have gone as far asBoucher to make it an overriding priority. &quot;We focus every single thing inthat context -- furthering our objective of satisfying the customer,&quot; hesays.;    EARLY ON, the company decided to spend 25 percent of its developmentmoney building test equipment. Normally, Boucher says, start-ups don't bother,they just let customers test their products.;   The company also decided topay its vendors on time -- unusual in a community where many companies ineffect increase their capital by paying vendors late. The message to Auspexemployees, Boucher says, is that the company keeps its promises.;   Butperhaps most startling is an Auspex policy that delays the company fromputting revenue on its books until customers state in writing that theirdegree of satisfaction is &quot;excellent&quot; (8 on a 10-point scale). Mostelectronics companies recognize revenue when a product is shipped. The quickerthe revenue is recognized, the quicker the sale boosts the bottom line.;   Atbest, Auspex's policy postpones revenue recognition for weeks while thecustomer tries the equipment and returns Auspex's survey. A customer who hasproblems or wants to be difficult could force Auspex to postpone the revenuerecognition for months.;   The reason for the policy, Boucher says, is notjust to ensure customer satisfaction. It also sends a strong signal toemployees about the company's priorities. &quot;People are looking for leadership&quot;and want to know what criteria to use in making decisions, he says.;  BOUCHER'S philosophy on customer satisfaction evolved during an 11-year careerwith IBM and after he co-founded Adaptec, a company that makes devices thatcontrol the flow of data and memory storage systems, in 1981. Its most recentannual sales totaled $128 million.;   Boucher, 48, resigned as Adaptec's chiefexecutive when its main business shifted to a technology &quot;that wasn't theclosest thing to my heart.&quot; He remains a director.;   Customers say Auspexpractices what Boucher preaches. Don Johnson, engineering information servicesmanager for Loral/Rolm Mil-Spec in San Jose, says Auspex volunteered to sendpeople to his site at 6 a.m. daily to work on a problem with an intermittentlycrashing computer system.;   &quot;I've been doing systems management for sevenyears, and I've never had a vendor doing service even come close to that, evenunder major threat,&quot; he says.;   Because of that level of service, you'd thinkBoucher's red phone never rings.;   That, however, isn't the case. Sometimesit rings every other day -- because the phone number is almost the same as theone for Birk's restaurant in Santa Clara.;   &quot;I get a lot of lunchreservations,&quot; Boucher says with a smile.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  James J.
