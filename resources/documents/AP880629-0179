Mahood was jubilant after Parliament gave final approval Tuesdaynight to two rigorous anti-smoking bills, despite a major lobbyingeffort from the $5.4 billion Canadian tobacco industry.   ``David has slain Goliath,'' said federal Health Minister JakeEpp, praising citizens' groups like Mahood's that took on anddefeated the tobacco lobby. ``They were outgunned, they wereoutmuscled, and quite frankly they were outfinessed,'' Epp said.   One bill, introduced by opposition New Democratic Party memberLynn McDonald, requires the government to provide a smoke-freeenvironment in all buildings under federal jurisdiction, includingbanks. It also must guarantee smoke-free travel on planes, ships,trains and buses.   Mindful that 7 million Canadians are smokers _ one adult inthree _ the bill also says employers may set up separatelyventilated smoking areas at their discretion.   The other bill came from the government and was described byMahood as ``the toughest in the world.'' It bans tobaccoadvertising in print as of Jan. 1; phases out billboard ads by 1991and promotion signs by 1993; restricts sponsorship of sports andcultural events, and prohibits free samples.   The bill further requires manufacturers to publicly identify alladditives in their products _ Mahood claims these includeturpentine, propane, ammonia and volcanic ash _ and to disclose thetoxic contents of cigarette smoke.   A leaflet detailing all known health risks from smoking withreplace the general warning now required on cigarette packets.   ``You might reasonably expect a document the size of the NewYork telephone directory,'' Mahood said. He said cigarette smokinghas been linked to 17 terminal diseases causing 35,000 deaths ayear in Canada and 300,000 in the United States.   ``Americans have always had a strong appreciation for the valueof informed consent,'' said Mahood. ``It will be difficult for (thetobacco industry) to argue that Americans aren't also entitled tothis information.''   From the tobacco farms of Ontario to the boardrooms of ImperialTobacco, RJR-Macdonald and Rothmans in Toronto and Montreal,industry leaders huddled in meetings Wednesday to discuss how toprotect their livelihood. The volume of cigarette sales in Canadahas slumped 22 percent in the past five years.   Spokesmen said the legislation may be challenged in court on thegrounds that the advertising ban violates a constitutionalguarantee of free speech. They complained that while tobaccoremains a legal product, it will soon be illegal to talk about itcommercially.   ``Whether the challenge comes from a magazine editor, an outdooradvertising firm, a retail chain, a manufacturer or all the aboveis hard to say right now,'' said Jacques Lariviere, spokesman forthe Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council. The industry employs60,000 Canadians.   Lariviere said the disclosure of cigarette additives involvesproprietary rights ``like the recipe for Coca-Cola,'' and heworried that the new laws ``could provide impetus to those south ofthe border who wish to remove the tobacco industry from the face ofthe earth.''   Michel Bedard, president of the industry-supported Smokers'Freedom Society, guessed that smokers will ignore the newhealth-hazard warnings.   ``You get the list of contents on a box of corn flakes butnobody really pays attention to it,'' said Bedard.   As for the ad ban, he noted that 140 million times a day someonein Canada lights a cigarette, ``and that's an advertisement initself.''   The ban could actually hurt the public if a safer filter isdeveloped but manufacturers are unable to tell anyone about it, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
