The experiment consisted of many steady-statestages registered for different primary inventories. The calculationwas done with RELAP5/MOD2 CYCLE 36.00. Discrepancies between the calculationand the experiment are observed: the core flow rate is overestimatedat inventories between 80 % and 95 %; the inventory at which dryout occursin the core is also much overestimated. The causes of these discrepanciesare studies through sensitivity calculations and the following key parametersare pointed out: the interfacial friction and the form loss coefficientsin the vessel riser, the SG U-tube multidimensional behaviour, the interfacialfriction in the SG inlet plenum and in the pipe located underneath.</TEXT></DOC>
