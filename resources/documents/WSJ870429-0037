IRA deductions are, of course, much curtailed under the new tax law. The old law allowed a working couple filing a joint tax return to deduct up to $4,000 a year in IRA contributions. Such IRA deductions can still be taken on joint returns if neither spouse is covered by a retirement plan or if the couple's adjusted gross income is less than $40,000.    But if one or both members of a couple filing jointly are covered by a retirement plan, the IRA deduction is reduced when combined income falls between $40,000 to $50,000 and is eliminated entirely when combined income exceeds that range.    However, many married couples at such income levels can preserve $2,000 of the IRA deduction -- and reduce their taxes -- if one working spouse isn't covered by a retirement plan and files a separate return.    &quot;In certain situations, filing separate returns can provide tax benefits that outweigh the costs imposed on separate filers,&quot; says Pamela J. Pecarich, a partner in the national tax office of Coopers andamp; Lybrand, the accounting firm.    Primarily because of the income-tax rate structure, the benefits of filing separately to claim an IRA deduction vary according to a couple's earnings. According to Coopers andamp; Lybrand's calculations, filing separately is most likely to yield net tax savings for couples whose incomes are equal or close to equal. The accounting firm says such couples generally will realize savings by filing separately when their combined income ranges from $45,000 to $220,000.    Coopers andamp; Lybrand offers as an example a husband and wife who both have adjusted gross income of $30,000; the husband is covered by a tax-favored retirement plan, but the wife isn't. Under the old tax law, they were entitled to as much as $4,000 in IRA deductions, whether they filed separate or joint returns.    Under the new law, the couple can't claim any IRA deduction if they file jointly, and their tax liability would be $9,153. If they file separate returns, though, the wife can take an IRA deduction of $2,000. Their tax bill in this case would be $8,682, a saving of $471.    This and other examples from Coopers andamp; Lybrand are based on tax rates for 1988, when phasing in of the new law's rates will be complete. The examples assume that each couple claims itemized deductions amounting to 16% of income, split evenly between the two returns, and that the couples claim no passive losses from rental activity.    For couples with a 70-30 income split, tax savings are generally available when combined income is $60,000 to $80,000 or $120,000 to $230,000, Coopers andamp; Lybrand says.    For example, consider a wife with income of $126,000 and a retirement plan, and a husband with $54,000 in income and no plan. If they file jointly, they aren't eligible for an IRA deduction, and their tax liability would be $41,147. By filing a separate return, the husband could take a $2,000 IRA deduction, and the couple's tax bill would shrink by $555.    For couples in which one spouse earns 90% of the income, filing separately to claim an IRA deduction results in a net tax saving only when the combined income exceeds $200,000, Coopers andamp; Lybrand says.    An IRA deduction doesn't always outweigh the cost of filing separate returns because the tax law contains several provisions designed to make it more advantageous for couples to file jointly. Among other things, the top marginal tax rate, 33%, takes effect at a lower income level for single filers than for joint filers.    Consider a husband with adjusted gross income of $38,500, covered by a retirement plan, and a wife with income of $16,500 and no plan. As in the first two examples, this couple could take a $4,000 IRA deduction under the old law but can't take any deduction if they file jointly under the new law. By filing separately, the wife could take a $2,000 deduction, but the couple's combined tax liability would be $8,083, about $100 more than their liability on a joint return.    For this couple, it would be better to file a joint return and for the wife to make a nondeductible IRA contribution if she wants to continue funding her retirement plan. Taxes on any income from an IRA investment, whether made under the old or new law, are deferred until the IRA holder begins to withdraw benefits after age 59 1/2. This deferral means the investment can grow faster than it would if taxed.    Despite the savings available to some couples who choose to file separate returns, Ms. Pecarich contends that the tax law unfairly makes one spouse's ability to claim an IRA deduction contingent on whether the other spouse has a retirement plan. In some cases, the provisions deny people the only access they had to tax-favored retirement plans, she says.    But Sheldon Cohen, a lawyer with the firm Morgan, Lewis andamp; Bockius in Washington and a former Internal Revenue Service commissioner, says the IRA changes in effect simply shift things back to where they were before the 1981 tax law made IRAs widely available to people who already had retirement plans. Most people contributing to IRAs under the 1981 tax law were middle-class and wealthy people who could afford to tie up money in long-term savings, he says. About 75% of the people who set up IRAs under the 1981 law already were covered by pension plans.    ---        Continuing an IRA?    One-third of those polled said they have an IRA. When asked whether they expect to put money into an IRA in 1987, given that the new tax law eliminates deductions on such accounts for many people, those IRA holders said: Yes ........................ 37% No ......................... 53% Not sure ................... 11% Source: Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of 1,596 adultsnationwide, Nov. 17-18, 1986</TEXT></DOC>
