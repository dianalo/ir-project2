East German Ambassador Klaus-Dietrich Ernst warned that failureto hold talks on short-range nuclear weapons could ``have negativeeffects'' on the Vienna negotiations.   He said negotiations on tactical nuclear rockets are vital forEast and West Germans.   ``The way these weapons are stationed today, it would be aboveall the citizens of both German states who would be the victim oftheir use,'' he said.   U.S. Ambassador Steven J. Ledogar said all the East blocdiplomats who addressed Friday's meeting insisted that a set of``parallel negotiations'' be held on reducing short-range nuclearweapons.   Ledogar suggested the Soviet-led alliance was using the Viennatalks, which are to focus strictly on non-nuclear weapons, to playupon NATO's internal bickering over the nuclear issue.   ``I suspect that they know that there's a certain amount ofdiscussion in the NATO camp,'' he said.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose popularity iscrumbling at home, has insisted that superpower talks begin soon onshort-range nuclear weapons. He also has asked NATO to delay adecision on whether to modernize the missiles until after electionsare held next year.   The United States and Britain want the weapons upgraded quicklyand reject talks with the Soviets on reducing short-range missiles.They argue that the missiles are necessary because of Sovietsuperiority in conventional forces.   In Washington, President Bush's spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidthat work on conventional force reductions is complex, but ``theUnited States and its allies are, however, encouraged by theseriousness with which the Soviet Union and its allies have enteredinto this negotiation.   ``What is needed now is for them to join NATO in exchanges thatare frank and constructive and enhance the chances for success,''Fitzwater said in a statement.   Ernst and Soviet Ambassador Oleg A. Grinevsky said that theseven Warsaw Pact nations see talks on short-range nuclear weaponsand naval forces as part of overall efforts to reduce arms andincrease security in Europe.   The issue is sensitive in Western Europe, where many areattracted to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's conciliatorygestures to the West, but especially so in West Germany, where mostof the missiles are based.   But Ledogar said all parties agreed that the current round ofVienna talks, a resumption of negotiations that began March 9, areto focus solely on conventional weapons.   NATO estimates the Warsaw Pact has more than a 2-1 advantage inartillery and tanks in Europe, and far more troops than the West.   Washington argues that even unilateral cuts announced byGorbachev last year will not alter the balance significantly.Gorbachev announced in December that 50,000 Soviet troops and 5,000tanks would pull out of East Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia by1991. The withdrawals began last week in Hungary with the departureof 31 T-64 tanks.   Ernst said that further unilateral cuts by the various WarsawPact allies mean that, by 1991, the Soviet bloc will cut its troopsby 581,300 men, 12,751 tanks, 10,030 artillery systems, 1,010combat aircraft, 895 armored vehicles and 30 ``nuclear systems.''   Grinevsky used Friday's session to outline a plan dividing thezone covered by the talks _ from the Atlantic to the Ural mountainsdeep inside the Soviet Union _ into smaller regions.   He said the sides should work to agree on overall totals for thenumber of men and weapons each military bloc can possess, but alsoagree on totals for each region.   But Grinevsky failed to provide any weapons ceilings. Ledogarsaid such totals were vital for progress at the talks.   At the previous round of talks that ended March 22, the WarsawPact outlined plans for reducing troops and weapons 10 percent to15 percent below present levels by 1994, a further 25 percent by1997 and moving to completely defensive forces by the year 2000.   NATO presented a more specific proposal for ceilings on tanks,artillery and armored personnel carriers.</TEXT></DOC>
