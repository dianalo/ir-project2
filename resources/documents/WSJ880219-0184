Christoph Semsdorf hardly has the appearance of a criminal. Yet in the eyes of his government, he is.    Mr. Semsdorf is making unauthorized contact with a Westerner, a &quot;treasonable act&quot; under East German law that could land him in jail. But Mr. Semsdorf considers himself a loyal East German citizen. He has no desire to leave. He says his fellow countrymen need to stay and speak out about the problems in their society. He says the government needs to listen. And he insists that his identity be revealed.    The church &quot;can't be a voice for change if we do things in secrecy,&quot; says the 49-year-old Lutheran pastor. &quot;It's necessary for us to speak out. Otherwise, how will the political climate improve?&quot;    Mr. Semsdorf's candor testifies to the changing political climate throughout Communist East Europe. The notions of bold reform emanating from Moscow have fueled expectations for change. Opposition to government repression is rising, especially among young activists. They are opposed by fossilized party leaders who fear reform and often won't permit it.    In normally docile East Germany, which boasts the Soviet bloc's highest standard of living, the confrontation has led to bold demonstrations. Even the building of the Berlin Wall 27 years ago didn't prompt major protests. But in Dresden last week, several hundred people paraded with banners, demanding greater civil liberties. While the surge in public disobedience seems to have subsided, Western analysts say it's only a matter of time before the next wave hits.    The government, meanwhile, seems indecisive. Its knee-jerk response is to crack down. State police arrested dozens of peace marchers in East Berlin on Jan. 17. Many were deported. But the same government backed down by releasing everyone who had been arrested.    &quot;The East Germans have a real problem on their hands and they have no idea how to handle it,&quot; says a Western diplomat. &quot;People are looking for more. A slightly better material deal and a bit more travel isn't enough. Their expectations are going beyond travel, to an easing of the tightness of life. But how do you do that when you feel your very existence is dependent on maintaining tight control?&quot;    For years the East German leadership used an iron fist on dissent. It has deported thousands of citizens, including some of its finest intellectuals. Since the Berlin Wall went up in 1961, it has killed 188 people who tried to flee to the West and imprisoned thousands more. Such brutality has a long tradition: The man who presided over the latest arrests, 81-year-old Minister for Security Erich Meilke, held the same post in 1953 when an uprising was quelled by Soviet tanks.    Ironically, the government's half-hearted efforts to grant more freedom to its citizens may be fueling dissatisfaction. It has eased travel restrictions in recent years. Last year about one of every five East Germans got a visa to visit the West. Almost all returned to East Germany. But they bring back Western ideas.    &quot;People aren't coming back and saying, 'My goodness, isn't it great we can travel,'&quot; says one minister in East Berlin. &quot;They're comparing their society to the one they saw there. They're wondering why criticism of the government is tolerated in the West and not here. They're asking a lot of very basic questions.&quot;    Discontent is strongest among the young. &quot;Many young people here are critical of the government,&quot; says a jean-clad teen-ager waiting in a block-long line outside Cafe Nord, an East Berlin disco. A friend next to him complains that the government forced him to change his university major. &quot;Why does the government always tell me what to do?&quot; he asks.    The protest movement has many faces. Some people who want to emigrate hope the trouble they cause will get them deported. Some young people want more Western music and goods. Some demand the right to do social work instead of military service. Others print pamphlets on protecting the environment.    The one unifying factor is the Lutheran Church, a focal point for protesters, whether they are believers or not. Protestants hold a special position in East Germany and enjoy more freedom than other religious groups behind the Iron Curtain, including the Polish Roman Catholic Church. Protestant churches are the only place, for instance, where unauthorized assemblies are permitted. In exchange for their freedoms, clerics have agreed not to meddle in politics.    But recent events have probably convinced officials that the church has reneged. In November, state police raided the rectory of East Berlin's Zion Church trying to uncover the whereabouts of an underground publication. Clerics protested the raid with candlelight vigils.    Events since Jan. 17 have added fuel to the fire. The incident started when dissidents joined an official march in East Berlin led by East German leader Erich Honecker. Arrests and tough talk followed. But the government backed down, partly because thousands of East Germans packed East Berlin's normally empty Protestant churches over a three-week period to demand the release of imprisoned activists.    The government condemned the action, but Pastor Semsdorf is unrepentant. &quot;As a pastor I am not interested in the problems of the country. I am interested in the problems of the people,&quot; he says. &quot;There is a big difference.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
