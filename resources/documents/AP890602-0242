The civilian jobless rate, taken from the Labor Department'smonthly household survey, fell 0.1 percentage point from April's5.3 percent, in line with the expectations of analysts.   But non-farm payroll growth, taken from a separate survey ofbusiness establishments, was up by only 101,000, down from April'srevised growth of 206,000 jobs. The May growth was the lowestmonth-to-month gain since 84,000 added payroll positions werereported in March 1986.   For the past three months, an average of only 160,000 jobs havebeen added to non-farm payrolls each month, down from the robustaverage monthly gain of 270,000 jobs reported in 1987 and 1988.   ``The great American jobs machine is cranking down to a moremoderate pace,'' said economist Allen Sinai of Boston Co. EconomicAdvisers Inc. ``But the economy does not appear to be headednear-term for a recession.''   Several analysts said after the release of the report today thatthe data _ which included some signs of moderating inflation _would give the Federal Reserve some justification for easing itstight rein on credit, but all agreed such a move was far fromcertain.   ``For a divided Fed it's a tough call,'' Sinai said.   In other signs of an economic slowdown, the Labor Departmentsaid the average private-sector nonagricultural workweek fell 0.3hours, to 34.6 hours. That decline was influenced by April figuresthat likely overestimated the work week because the survey did nottake into account that Good Friday and the Easter holidays fell inMarch this year instead of April.   The average factory workweek also fell last month, slipping 0.2hours to 41 hours while average overtime fell an equal amount to3.8 hours, the Labor Department reported.   And in data that will hailed be by those looking for signs ofeasing inflation, average hourly wages inched up only 0.1 percentin May following a 0.7 increase for April. Average weekly earningsfell from April's $335.04 to $332.51 on a seasonally adjusted basis.   The consensus among analysts was that some 220,000 jobs would beadded to the nation's economy, more than double the number reportedby the government.   Such projections have led analysts to predict the economy wouldshow too much strength for the Federal Reserve to ease its tightrein on credit. But the sluggishness demonstrated by today's reportlikely will increase pressure on the central bank to relax monetarypolicy.   The service-producing industries again accounted for theoverwhelming job growth, adding 134,000 jobs to help offset some ofthe declines in other economic sectors. But even that number waswell down from a revised April gain of nearly 190,000 newservice-producing jobs and well off the sector's 250,000 monthlyaverage gain last year.   In that service sector, transportation and retail and wholesaletrade posted job gains but were well below their 1988 averages.   Goods-producing industries reported a net loss of 33,000 jobs,with mining down slightly and construction employment off by 14,000positions. Manufacturing operations reported a loss of 18,000 jobsfrom April.   The unemployment rate dipped despite the slow job growthbecause, the government said, the civilian labor force fell by49,000 people to 123.6 million. That indicated the influx ofstudents into the summer labor force, generally seen in May orJune, did not occur in any great number last month.   In a positive sign, the government said the number of part timeworkers last month who wanted to work full time fell by about300,000, to 4.8 million.   Declines in the unemployment rate were reported for both whiteand black adult men while joblessness soared among black women andblack teen-agers.   Unemployment among white adult men fell from 4 percent to 3.6percent in May while the rate dropped among black men from 10percent to 9.4 percent.   For white women, the unemployment rate last month was unchangedat 4.1 percent while for black women it shot up from 8.8 percent to9.5 percent.   Unemployment for black teens climbed from 26.2 percent to 28.4percent. The rate among white teen-agers was pegged at 11.2percent, down from 11.5 percent.   Among Hispanics, unemployment dropped from 8.3 percent to 7.9percent, said the government, which does not provide a gender orage breakdown for Hispanics.   In a separate calculation that includes military personnelstationed in the United States, the jobless rate dipped from 5.2percent to 5.1 percent, the department said.   The data included a number of revisions to previous reportsdating back to 1987 because of the Labor Department's annual reviewof state unemployment records.   Those changes included a reduction of 595,000 in thegovernment's estimate of job growth in the last two years.   The report, the first comprehensive look at economic performancelast month, indicated much slower growth than most analysts hadexpected, a sign the slowdown of the first quarter continues intothe second three months of the year.</TEXT></DOC>
