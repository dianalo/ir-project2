The agreement follows nearly a year of takeover jousting, in which Citadel offered $18.50 a share, or about $107 million, for Valley Federal, which opposed the bid, and Citadel dropped it several months ago. The news sent Valley Federal shares up $2, to close at $14, in national over-the-counter trading yesterday. Valley Federal had a $3.1 million loss for the first nine months.    The two thrifts' pact provides for negotiation of all terms and conditions of a definitive acquisition agreement, except for the purchase price. Within five days of an accord and approval by both companies' boards, Citadel is to make a firm bid -- with a price, to be paid principally in cash -- for Valley Federal. Some securities would be payable for All Valley Acceptance Co., a troubled financial unit of Valley Federal. </TEXT></DOC>
