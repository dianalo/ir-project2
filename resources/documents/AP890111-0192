On the sidelines of the international chemical weapons conferencehere, Western delegates have been alleging that Iraq's Middle Eastneighbors are lining up in Baghdad to learn how to make toxic arms.   One Western expert, speaking to reporters on condition ofanonymity, said, ``Iraq has used them (chemical arms) for five yearsand has lots of experience with a range of agents and deliverysystems. ... more even than the United States and Soviet Union.   ``Some Third World countries are going to Iraq to learn.''   But Iraq's foreign minister, Tarik Aziz, speaking in English at anews conference Wednesday, declared, ``Whatever experience we havein this respect we will not spread it to others. We are not verymuch fond of exporting our experience in this respect.''   Iraq is believed to have several plants producing chemicalweapons.
