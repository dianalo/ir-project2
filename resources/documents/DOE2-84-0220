<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-84-0220 </DOCNO><TEXT>A computer program POST-CASKETSS has been developed for the purpose ofcalculation result representation for thermal and structural analysiscomputer code system CASKETSS (CASKETSS means a modular code system forCASK Evaluation code system for Thermal and Structural Safety). Mainfeatures of POST-CASKETSS are as follows; (1) Function of calculationresult representation for thermal and structural analysis computer programsis provided in the program. (2) Two and three dimensional graphic representationfor finite element and finite difference programs are available in theprogram. (3) The capacity of graphics of geometry, temperature contorand temperature-time curve are provided for thermal analysis. (4) Thecapacity of graphics of geometry, deformation, stress contor, displacement-timecurve, velocity-time curve, acceleration-time curve, stress-time curve,force-time curve and moment-time curve are provided for structural analysis.(5) This computer program operates both the time shearing system andthe batch system. In the paper, brief illustration of calculation method,input data and sample calculations are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
