Indeed, if PresidentBush wins, he will emerge with his hand strengthened on awide range of important matters.   International Security Arrangements. Working the phones,Mr. Bush in a matter of days has moved the issue of post-ColdWar security from the level of abstraction to concreteaction. He has thrown an economic and military noose aroundSaddam Hussein, and is now drawing it tighter, with hisdeployment of large U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia as the latestand most dramatic step.</LP><TEXT>   The deployment means Mr. Bush has lined up Saudi Arabia aswell as Egypt and other nations to protect Saudi oil fields.Turkey has honored its side of the NATO agreement by banningthe loading of tankers with oil from the Iraqi pipeline, andby providing a base for U.S. F-111s within striking distanceof Iraqi targets. A French destroyer was sailing through theSuez, and two U.S. aircraft carriers were positioned at themouth of the Persian Gulf.   Mr. Bush's blockade, in short, has already isolated Iraq.Saddam Hussein is perfectly capable of further rashness withhis huge army and chemical weapons, and as the noose tightensmay strike out in blood. Yet it now seems possible tospeculate that in the end he could find himself evicted fromnot only Kuwait but Iraq itself. If so, it would be a lessonto all the world's bullies and potential bullies.   And a lesson, too, about the discussion of &quot;bringingAmerican troops home&quot; now that the Cold War has thawed. Theembarrassing pre-Saddam votes in the Democratic-controlledCongress to gut the Defense budget need to be revisited,along with such issues as how to honor our side of the NATObargain with Turkey. Those of us who have been skeptics aboutthe United Nations may need to take another look if eventsconsolidate the kind of big-power cooperation itsinstitutional design assumed. Should Mr. Bush succeed againstIraq, he will have earned the stature, both domestically anddiplomatically, to lead a large reordering of internationalsecurity.   The Myth of American Decline. Since Vietnam, an entireschool of academics and their Wall Street admirers has grownup around the notion that the American Century is at an end.If the Bush exercise in American leadership evident the pastseveral days succeeds, the decline school will belong inwhatever basement now houses Eastern Europe's faculties ofMarxist economics.   The International Economy. As a logical extension of thosediscussions, Mr. Bush could be expected to provide somevision, largely missing at this juncture, of the future shapeof the international economy. If the united front of nationsthat Mr. Bush has assembled to preserve the global economyemerges victorious, its next task ought to be neededinstitutional reforms for peacetime. The policy discussionaround such matters as destructive agricultural subsidies orinternational monetary arrangements has been drifting orneglected altogether, and is scarcely less dangerous than ajump in oil prices.   Presidential Authority. As a Washington insider, GeorgeBush has also been an on-site witness to the entire period ofdecline in presidential authority. The nearby Rule of Lawcolumn discusses such artifacts of that decline as the WarPowers Resolution (See &quot;Rule of Law: What if We Had a War andNo One Invited the Lawyers?&quot; -- WSJ August 8, 1990). We wouldadd to that the Budget Reform Act, which tipped spending inCongress's favor and into its current abyss. Mr. Bush hasbeen looking for the right moment to enhance presidentialauthority, restoring a proper balance with congressionalpowers in domestic and foreign affairs. With success in theGulf, that moment would have arrived.   Indeed the Iraq crisis has the potential to make clearthat a vigorous U.S. presidency is an inevitable necessity ofa functional political system, at home and abroad. Itspowers, if deftly used, can be one of history's mosteffective forces for positive good.</TEXT></DOC>
