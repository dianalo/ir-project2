Shamir said he preferred lower-level talks than those proposedby the United States and that they should be held in Israel.   Security forces killed a Palestinian and wounded three othersduring protests in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and Arabreports said a Palestinian accused of collaborating with Israel waskilled by masked activists.   The latest deaths brought to 595 the number of Palestinianskilled by Israeli soldiers and civilians during the 22-month-olduprising; another 130 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabsas suspected collaborators. Forty Israelis also have died in theviolence.   A U.S. plan formulated by Secretary of State James A. Baker IIIis designed to bring about a meeting in Cairo urged by EgyptianPresident Hosni Mubarak as a way to bridge differences betweenIsrael and the PLO.   The underground Palestinian leadership, in its 47th leafletsince the start of the rebellion in December 1987, said it``rejects America's suspicious role, primarily James Baker's fivepoints.''   Baker's plan calls for consultations between the Israeli andEgyptian foreign ministers to agree on the makeup of a Palestiniandelegation for the proposed Cairo meeting.   Mubarak urged the meeting as a way to revive Israel's stalledpeace initiative, which calls for elections among Palestinians inthe West Bank and Gaza to pick delegates to negotiate with Israelon interim self-rule.   The leaflet from the uprising's PLO-backed leadership saidBaker's ideas merely supported Shamir's election plan and were away to avoid the international peace conference that the PLO wants.The uprising leaders already have rejected the Shamir plan.   In an interview with the independent daily Maariv, Shamir saidhe saw no reason to meet in Cairo.   ``Why go to Cairo, when the two sides, Israeli and Palestinian,are here?'' Shamir asked.   He said the meeting should be in Israel and that it shouldmerely be a gathering of technocrats to iron out details of hiselection plan.   Shamir aide Avi Pazner later said the prime minister did notmean that such talks could only be held in Israel but was ``justraising different possibilites.''   But he said Shamir does wants to lower the profile of thecontacts.   ``You cannot conduct high-level meetings in the limelightbecause it is difficult to get results,'' Pazner said.   Also Sunday, a military court sentenced a reserve soldier to twoyears in prison for causing the death of two Palestinians in May1988, the army said.   Army raido said Ilan Orev, 25, was chasing stone-throwers in theWest Bank village of Bani Naim when he knelt, took aim and firedtwo bullets into the heads of two rioters, in violation of ordersnot to open fire.   Late Sunday, 3-year-old Attiyah el-Ghurani of the Shati refugeecamp died of a gunshot injury he suffered on Thursday, the armysaid.   Officials at Shifa hospital in Gaza said the boy's skull hadbeen shattered by a rubber-coated metal pellet fired by Israelisoldiers.   The army said at the time that its troops had not opened fire inthe area but that it was checking further. An army spokesman saidSunday that no new details were available.</TEXT></DOC>
