The plan, which was expected, was announced in a filing with the association, which must approve tender offers for listed companies. Framatome plans to offer 4,150 francs ($717.19) a share for the 43.5% stake, or a total of 2.84 billion francs ($490.8 million).    Schneider's bid is for 43.3% of Telemecanique, at 3,900 francs a share, or a total of 2.66 billion francs. Trading in Telemecanique remained suspended at 3,735 francs a share.    Officials at both Framatome, a nuclear-reactor concern, and Telemecanique said the counterbid has the support of the target company's board. Sources close to Telemecanique said Framatome already has acquired 9% of Telemecanique from a group of banks. Schneider, a French industrial group, holds 12.1% of Telemecanique. </TEXT></DOC>
