Pierce Jr.urged an aide to arrange financing for a New York City projectafter receiving a written appeal from another Reagan administrationofficial, documents released Thursday show.   Pierce's handwritten instruction to former executive assistantDeborah Gore Dean to ``check into this and try to get it through''suggests a more active role than Pierce has acknowledged insecuring federal housing subsidies for individuals who maderequests to him personally.   In response to Freedom of Information Act requests, HUD onThursday released more than 20,000 pages of documents from thefiles of Dean, whose position made her a key official at HUD andwho has refused to testify before Congress on constitutionalgrounds.   In the files were letters showing Dean received requests forhelp on projects from members of Congress, including Democrats, andother officials. The files also show then-Defense Secretary CasparWeinberger and White House aides were among the politicallyconnected who contacted Pierce and Dean regarding HUD projects andanother occassion in which former HUD Secretary Carla Hillsconvinced Pierce to overrule subordinates in favor of her clients.   In testimony before a congressional panel last spring, Piercesaid he received many requests for aid from friends and politicalallies, and that he always referred them to appropriate staffmembers with the instruction that they were to receive ``carefulconsideration.''   Pierce, who last month refused to testify again before Congressciting his constitutional right against self-incrimination, said inhis May appearance that his instructions were not a recommendationor order to approve funds.   ``Over time, people ask me to help them get all kinds ofbenefits and things like that and my answer to them has always beenthe same thing,'' Pierce said. ``It's been basically that we'llgive your request very careful consideration and if your requestsuits all of our requirements, you'll have a chance of getting whatyou're seeking.''   The New York project was mentioned in a 1985 handwritten note toPierce from the Department of Commerce's assistant secretary forproductivity, technology and innovation, urging HUD to back aproposed housing project in the Morningside Heights area ofManhattan near Columbia University.   At the bottom, in Pierce's handwritting, was written: ``ToDebbie _ Check into this and try to get it through.'' It bearsPierce's initials, ``SRP Jr.''   The note to Pierce was addressed simply ``Sam,'' and signed``Bruce,'' on stationery of the assistant secretary of commerce.   D. Bruce Merrifield, who held that Commerce position at thetime, could not be reached in calls to his home, or the AmericanElectronics Association, where he is a consultant. The Commerceofficial's note said he was familiar with the project through hischurch, which had supported the project.   The $5.6 million, 99-unit senior-citizen housing project wasgranted $1.2 million in rental subsidies, according to FrancineKellman, spokeswoman for the HUD regional office in New York.   Pierce's attorney, Paul L. Perito, said he had not seen theletter to Pierce and was not familiar with the project. But he saidthere was ``nothing incriminatory in that situation.''   ``Any Cabinet secretary occupies a political position and theremay be a range of reasons why in his judgment he thought it was aworthy project,'' Perito said. ``And in any project in which he hasshown an interest he has never asked anyone to deviate fromresponsible, professional government standards.''   At the time the Commerce official recommended the project toPierce, developers were proposing to mix elderly housing withstudent housing for Columbia University. Kellman said the studenthousing proposal was dropped and the project was developed by theEcumenical Community Development Organization.   Stuart Weisberg, staff director of the House subcommitteeprobing the HUD scandals, said the letter was one of several thepanel has that ``suggest some people got more than carefulconsideration'' from HUD under Pierce.   On another occasion, documents showed that after a privateresearch company wrote Pierce to complain that several of its bidsfor HUD work had been rejected, the secretary wrote to Dean:``Let's try to help this fellow. I think he and his company havebeen unfairly treated.''   It could not be immediately determined whether that firm latergot HUD work.   Weinberger's name surfaced on two notes by aides discussing aproject he had recommended to Pierce. One of the aides said theproject had not been awarded funds but ``will be a good candidatefor the secretary's discretionary fund.'' It could not beimmediately determined whether the project was ultimately given HUDmoney.   Mrs. Hills, now the Bush administration's trade representative,appealed to Pierce after a California client trying to sell aHUD-backed development was told it would have to pay $1.3 millioninto reserve accounts before the deal could be approved. Pierce, onDean's recommendation, agreed to reduce the amount to $855,000, therecords show.   The five boxes of files shed additional light on Ms. Dean'spower at HUD and her frequent contacts with prominent Republicans,developers with HUD dealings, Pierce's former law partners andothers:   _She once rewrote a draft of a speech the White House hadprepared for a visit by President Reagan to an elementary school.``Please excuse our crassness,'' she said in a note to the WhiteHouse accompanying her revised version.   _In a handwritten note to Pierce, Ms. Dean said the department'sOffice of General Counsel ``can find no document that says you haveever delegated authority over Mod Rehab to anyone.''   The Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program was found by thedepartment's inspector general to have been to be riddled withpolitical influence; Pierce has said he delegated the power toaward the lucrative subsidies to a three-member committee thatincluded Dean.   _While members of Congress have expressed outrage at the powershe held, Dean's files show she was frequently lobbied by membersand their staffs. Mayors, other local officials and prominentRepublicans also frequently wrote her to support HUD proposals orapplicants for jobs at the department.</TEXT></DOC>
