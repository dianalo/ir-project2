And economists said the move is likely to stunt growthof European economies.   France, which was widely expected to raise rates to defendits franc against the mark, increased the key interventionrate at which it lends to banks to 9.6% from 9.25%. Followingthe move, most major banks in France raised their prime, orbase, lending rates by 0.35 percentage point to 10.35%.</LP><TEXT>   Italy, unable to go it alone and fearing for its currency,also raised the discount rate one-half percentage point to12%. The lira, which had already weakened following theBundesbank's tightening, had fallen further after the FederalReserve Board lowered the U.S. discount rate Friday.   Spain's central bank, meanwhile lifted its money-marketintervention rate by 0.25 percentage point but left its keybenchmark intervention rate unchanged at 12.5%.   The Netherlands, Austria, Denmark and Belgium raised theirkey rates by a half percentage point last week. The Britishgovernment, desperate to see some sort of economic recoverybefore a general election that must be held by July 9, hasresisted an increase.   Economists said forecasts for growth in Europe's economieswould have to be cut back now that the cost of credit hadrisen. &quot;The Bundesbank action has damped the chances of aneconomic recovery in Europe,&quot; said Ulrich Hombrecher, chiefeconomist at Westdeutsche Landesbank.   The Bundesbank on Thursday raised its discount rate by ahalf percentage point to a postwar high of 8% and increasedits Lombard emergency funding rate by the same margin, to9.75%, to stem what it feels is runaway inflation fueled bythe rebuilding of eastern Germany.   Bundesbank President Helmut Schlesinger said otherEuropean nations were free to treat interest rates as theywanted, but it was clear most couldn't afford to ignore theGermans' lead.   Resistance would have caused the mark's value to rise evenmore sharply in the European Monetary System's exchange-ratemechanism, by which participating nations promise to limitthe variations in their currencies' exchange rates. Had themark risen, other currencies would have been pushed lower,raising the specter of devaluations.   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developmenthad already sharply scaled back predictions for growth in theworld's major economies. But after yesterday's actionsEuropewide, &quot;It is clear that last week's forecasts from theOECD are already out of date,&quot; said Jonathan Hoffman, aEuropean economist with Credit Suisse-First Boston in London.   Mr. Hombrecher said Europe's economies are trapped, withhigh interest rates on one side and an appreciation of theircurrencies against the dollar on the other. The dollar'sretreat after the Bundesbank rate rise may be the moredangerous factor. &quot;That's going to hurt,&quot; he said. &quot;It makesEurope's goods more expensive, but also gives huge chances toEurope's competitors to sell their products here.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
