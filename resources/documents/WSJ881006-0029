L.P.: Restructuring Is Approved By Holders of 72% of Units </HL><SO> </SO><CO> APP APA </CO><IN> TNM </IN><TEXT>   Apache Petroleum Co. L.P. said in Denver that holders of 72% of its units approved a restructuring that will return the oil and natural gas limited partnership to a corporate structure.    Apache previously said about 28 million of its 47.6 million units were tendered under an offer to exchange each Apache unit for 0.4 share of Apache Corp., the partnership's general partner. The remainder of the partnership's unit holders will receive one new share of Key Production Co. for each unit owned.    In addition, Key will receive a proportionate amount of the partnership's oil and gas properties, and Apache Corp. will retain an 8.4% stake in Key, the same stake it had in the partnership.    Apache wanted to restructure the partnership into a corporation because low oil and gas prices limited the partnership's ability to pay a distribution and still have funds left over to reinvest. In addition, the partnership structure had relatively high overhead costs and new tax laws have limited the deductibility of passive investments, making the structure less attractive. </TEXT></DOC>
