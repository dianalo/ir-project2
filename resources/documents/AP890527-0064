Policearrested more than 500 people.   The government deployed about 7,000 troops in a major show ofstrength. Hundreds of police in combat fatigues with shieldsblocked off the park where the rally was to be held. Other officersblanketed the city center.   Dissidents and radical students staged scattered, peacefulprotests in the downtown area after the rally was blocked. Bands ofstudents attempted to march in some downtown areas, but werequickly dispersed and some students were dragged away.   Small peaceful protests were reported in the provincial citiesof Taegju and Chonju, and about 10,000 people marched in thesouthern city of Kwangju, according to Korean press reports.   About 300 radical students were in the second day of a hungerstrike at the Myongdong Roman Catholic cathedral in Seoul. They aredemanding the fall of the Roh government and a government admissionthat police killed a radical student. Riot police ringed thecathedral but did not move in.   Some of the hunger strikers wrote anti-government slogans withtheir blood drawn by biting their fingers as other protestersapplauded. ``Down with the dictatorship,'' the hungers strikerschanted.   The protesters said they were inspired by a hunger strike heldby students demanding political reforms in China.   About 500 students were blocked by riot police when theyattempted to march out of Yonsei University in western Seoul.Students pushed and hit police with sticks but were unable to getpast lines of troopers with interlocked shields.   ``Bury Roh Tae-woo!'' students shouted. ``Drive out theYankees!''   It was the second Saturday in a row that the government blockeda protest in Seoul. Few people responded to the dissidents' call totake part in the protests, despite widespread appeals.   Dissidents and radical students have little public supportbecause of their violent tactics and extremist views.   The United National Democratic Movement, the main dissidentalliance which called for protests in Seoul and 10 other cities,had predicted up to 100,000 people would demonstrate nationwide.   It called the rally to denounce the government and demand a fullinvestigation into the death of radical student Lee Chol-kyu. Thealliance had said its protests would be peaceful because of publicanger over past violent demonstrations.   Dissidents claim police tortured and killed Lee, whose body wasfound in a reservoir May 10 near the southern city of Kwangju. Thegovernment says police chased Lee after stopping him at a roadblockbut deny any official involvement in the death.   The government says an autopsy shows Lee drowned and officialsspeculate he fell into the reservoir.   In addition to the fall of the Roh government, dissidents aredemanding the removal of the 43,000 U.S. troops based in SouthKorea under a defense pact.</TEXT></DOC>
