Species for which trade is controlledare included in three appendices. Appendix I includes species threatenedwith extinction that are or may be affected by trade. Appendix II includesspecies that although not necessarily threatened with extinction may becomeso unless trade in them is strictly controlled. It also lists species thatmust be subject to regulation in order that trade in other currently orpotentially threatened species may be brought under effective control (e.g.,because of difficulty in distinguishing specimens of currently or potentiallythreatened species from those of other species). Appendix III includesspecies that any Party nation identifies as being subject to regulationwithin its jurisdiction for purposes of preventing or restricting exploitation,and for which it needs the cooperation of other Parties in controllingtrade.Any Party nation may propose amendments to Appendices I and II for considerationof meetings of the Conference of the Parties. The text of any proposalmust be communicated to the CITES Secretariat at least 150 days beforethe meeting. The Secretariat must then consult the other Parties and appropriateintergovernmental agencies, and communicate their responses and the Secretariat'sown findings and recommendations to all Parties no later than 30 days beforethe meeting. Amendments are adopted by a two-thirds majority of the Partiespresent and voting. <ITAG tagnum="84">Information Sought </ITAG>This notice announces proposals submitted by Parties other than the UnitedStates for consideration at the forthcoming meeting of the Parties, andsets forth tentative negotiating positions of the United States delegationon them. The Service solicits comments on its tentative negotiating positionsand on the biological status of these species, on the amount and type oftrade in specimens of these species, and on the impact of trade on thepopulations, especially on the survival of the species. Comments that relatethis information to the criteria for adding or removing species from theAppendices would be especially helpful. It is neither practical nor in the best interest of the United States toestablish inflexible negotiating positions on proposals in advance of themeeting. The Service based the present tentative positions mainly on areview of information presented by proponents in terms of criteria adoptedat previous meetings of the Conference of the Parties of CITES. Some ofthe proposals have had to be translated into English from Spanish or French(also official languages under CITES). Supporting statements for proposalsby Japan and Indonesia have not been submitted, although brief statementsproposing certain species for the appendices have been received by theCITES Secretariat from those countries. How the Secretariat and Partieswill deal with these proposals is unknown. Except for one or two speciesfor which information comparable to the supporting statement is availablethe tentative negotiating position is to oppose the proposed amendment,and in fact the final position may be to oppose all proposals without supportingstatements unless the best available scientific information supports theproposal. Because information provided in many of the proposals and otherwise currentlyavailable to the Service is too incomplete to allow clear judgments abouttheir merits, several of the tentative negotiating positions presentedare likely to be revised as further biological and trade data are obtained.Final guidance for the delegation is to be based on the best availablebiological and trade information, including comments received in responseto this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposals </ITAG>In accordance with the provisions of Article XV, paragraph 1(a), of theConvention; Austria, Belgium, Botswana, China, Denmark, Ethiopia, the FederalRepublic of Germany, Gambia, Guatemala, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel,Japan, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Netherlands, Paraguay, Philippines,Portugal, Somalia, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania, Thailand, United Kingdom,Uruguay, and Zambia, all Parties to the Convention, have communicated tothe Secretariat the following proposals for amendment of Appendices I andII of the Convention. These proposals will be considered at the seventhmeeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, to be heldin Lausanne, Switzerland, from October 9-20, 1989. A total of 75 foreign proposals on both plant and animal species were submittedof which 14 were submitted by Switzerland based on a 10-year review ofthe listings that was adopted at the 1981 Conference of the Parties inNew Delhi, India. The proposals by Switzerland recommend the removal ofthose species from the Appendices that have never been reported in tradeand which the chairman of the 10-year review committee believed shouldbe considered for deletion from the Appendices, unless the species shouldbe included in Appendix II because they are very similar in appearanceto related taxa that do appear in trade. We point out, however, that the lack of reported trade for some speciesproposed for removal from the Appendices may be due to (1) their rarity,(2) the possibility that their listing in the Appendices has inhibitedtrade, or (3) the lack of proper documentation or reporting of trade. Consequently,the Service does not believe lack of appearance in trade is by itself asufficient reason to warrant the removal of a taxon from the Appendices.In establishing the tentative negotiating position of these 10-year review,delisting proposals, the Service considered the degree of vulnerabilityof the species and the possibility of its being in trade. Proposals by Parties other than the United States are listed in the followingtable. Tentative negotiating positions and the basis for them also areindicated. These positions were taken largely on the basis of the informationcontained in the proposal. If inadequate population and/or trade informationwas provided, the Service's position was usually opposed to the proposal.However, the Service was slightly more accepting of limited data and ofdata from other sources when considering uplisting proposals. The completetext of each proposal will be available for public inspection at the Service'sOffice of Scientific Authority (see address above).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/>  <H1>Species </H1><H1>Proposed amendment </H1><H1>Proponent </H1><H1>Tentative U.S. position</H1><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Mammals</T4></ITAG>Order Chiroptera<ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Peteropus insularis </T3>(Truk flying fox) <D>Transfer from II to I </D><D>Sweden </D><D>Support (6,7).</D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Peteropus mariannus </T3>(Mariana flying fox) <D>......do </D><D>......do </D><D>  Do.</D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Peteropus molossinus </T3>(Ponape flying fox) <D>......do </D><D>......do </D><D>  Do.</D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Peteropus phaeocephalus </T3>(Mortlock flying fox) <D>......do </D><D>......do </D><D>  Do.</D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Peteropus pilosus </T3>(Large Palau flying fox) <D>......do </D><D>......do </D><D>  Do.</D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Peteropus samoensis </T3>(Samoan flying fox) <D>......do </D><D>......do </D><D>  Do.</D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Peteropus tokudae </T3>(Little Mariana flying fox) <D>......do </D><D>......do </D><D>Oppose (8).</D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Peteropus tonganus </T3>(Insular flying fox) <D>......do </D><D>......do </D><D>Oppose (9).</D>Order Carnivora<ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Melursus ursinus </T3>(Sloth bear) <D>Add to I </D><D>Federal Republic of Germany, India </D><D>Support (7).</D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Ursus americanus </T3>(Black bear) <D>Add to II </D><D>Japan </D><D>Oppose (1,14).</D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Ursus arctos </T3>(Brown bear) <D>Retain populations of Afghanistan, India, Mexico, Nepal, and Pakistanin I; include all other populations in II </D><D>China, Denmark </D><D>Oppose (15).</D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Ursus arctos </T3>spp. (Brown bear) <D>Inclusion in II </D><D>Japan </D><D>Oppose (1,14).</D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Aonyx cinerea </T3>(Asian small-clawed otter) <D>Transfer from II to I </D><D>India </D><D>Support (6,7).</D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Lutra perspicillata </T3>(Smooth-coated otter) <D>Transfer from II to I </D><D>India </D><D>  Do.</D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Felis paradalis </T3>(Ocelot) <D>Transfer from II to I </D><D>Federal Republic of Germany </D><D>  Do.</D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Felis pardinus </T3>(Iberian lynx) <D>Transfer from II to I </D><D>Federal Republic of Germany </D><D>  Do.</D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Felis tigrina </T3>(Little spotted cat) <D>......do </D><D>Portugal, Federal Republic of Germany </D><D>  Do.</D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Felis weidii </T3>(Margay) <D>......do </D><D>......do </D><D>  Do.</D>Order Proboscidea<ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Loxodonta africana </T3>(African elephant) <D>......do </D><D>Austria, Gambia, Hungary, Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania </D><D>  Do.</D>Order Artiodactyla<ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Cephalophus jentinki </T3>(Jentink's duiker) <D>Transfer from II to I </D><D>Federal Republic of Germany </D><D>Oppose (9).</D><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Birds</T4></ITAG>Order Rheiformes<ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Rhea americana </T3>(Rhea) <D>Add to II </D><D>Japan </D><D>Support (1,10).</D>Order Tinamiformes<ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Rhynchotus rufescens </T3>(3 ssp.)

The Service will providean English translation upon request.(3) Submitted as part of the 10-year review of listings for downlistingor removal from the Appendices. The Service either supports the proposalbelieving the information presented to be an accurate interpretation ofthe likely effect of trade or opposes the proposal because the lack ofreported trade for some species proposed for removal may be due to theirrarity or lack of proper documentation or reporting of trade. (4) Transfer of certain Nile Crocodile populations from Appendix I to IIpursuant to Resolution Conf. 3.15 on Ranching; some subject to annual exportquotas as indicated. While the Service opposes the ranching proposals ingeneral, the Service would support continuation of the downlisting fromAppendix I to Appendix II with country by country export quotas, probablyunder an extension of the provisions of Conf. 5.21. The Service has severalconcerns about the ranching proposals. Most have inadequate biologicalinformation to support an actual downlisting, and some do not have sufficientinformation to justify adoption of the ranching proposal. Further, a patchworkpattern of countries with unrestricted export (accepted with ranching proposal)or with restricted trade with quotas or without authorized commercial trademight complicate implementation. (5) Transfer of certain Nile Crocodile and sea turtle populations fromAppendix I to II pursuant to Resolution Conf. 5.21, subject to annual exportquotas. (6) The intention of this proposal is to transfer the taxon from AppendixII to I since continued trade may threaten the species with possible extinction.(7) Listing of the taxon, as proposed, appears to be justified by informationin the proposal or currently available to the Service.(8) While this species is probably extinct, any trade is likely to be internalto the United States and its separate listing on Appendix I does not seemwarranted.(9) The population status (i.e., degree of threat of extinction of theentire species) does not appear to warrant listing, downlisting, or delistingas proposed. (10) Listing of this species or taxon appears justified because of thesimilarity of appearance of this species to others that are subject totrade.(11) The Service would support listing this taxon in Appendix I on thebasis of resolution Conf. 2.19 (i.e., due to the taxon's rarity any tradein the species would be detrimental) and trade has been documented andmay increase.(12) Available information suggests that there is little likelihood thatthere has been or will be any significant international trade in this species.(13) More than half of the species in the genus are believed to be threatenedwith extinction. Resolution Conf. 6.19 provides for the artificially propagatedhybrids to be treated as if on Appendix II. As a general matter, artificiallypropagated specimens of Appendix I species can be exported from the UnitedStates under a renewable export permit valid for multiple shipments during6 months.(14) The Service opposes this proposal until supporting documentation andadditional biological and trade data become available. (15) The listing of the taxon, as proposed, generally appears to be justifiedby the information in the proposal or currently available to the Service,but the proposal also transfers the Chinese and Russian populations of<T3>Ursus arctos pruinosus </T3>and<T3> U. a. isabellinus </T3>from Appendix I to II which does not appearto be warranted.(16) Population information is limited although the information presentedin the proposal suggests a small and declining population within its restrictedrange. Furthermore, trade appears sufficiently large to be affecting thesurvival of the species.(17) One might presume that this species is sufficiently rare to be includedin Appendix I under provisions of Conf. 2.19. However, the population informationpresented in the proposal is not adequate to make this determination. (18) Population and internal trade information needs to be clarified, butinformation available suggests that trade should be curtailed.(19) Biological and trade information presented on individual genera isnot sufficient to meet the Berne criteria. However, we recognize that enoughinformation may become available to support the addition of some generato Appendix II.(20) Biological and trade information presented do not appear to supportlisting in Appendix I. However, enough information may become availableto support listing the species in Appendix II.(21) Submitted as part of the 10-year review of the listing for removalfrom the Appendices because the species is believed to be more common and/orno trade has been documented. However, the species is sufficiently rareand/or the possibility of international trade sufficiently likely thatour tentative position is to oppose complete removal from the Appendices,but to accept a downlisting of the species to Appendix II.(22) Proposed quota consistent with quota adopted at COP6.<ITAG tagnum="84">Future Actions</ITAG>The next regular meeting of the Parties is scheduled to be held in Lausanne,Switzerland from October 9-20, 1989.
