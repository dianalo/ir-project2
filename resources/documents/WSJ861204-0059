At a hastily arranged gathering of securities analysts, the Washington-based telecommunications concern said most of the 2,300 jobs to be cut will come from a consolidation of network-control and customer service centers, warehouses, telemarketing and administrative staffs.    William E. Conway Jr., senior vice president and chief financial officer, said cuts in sales and marketing staffs would be &quot;very small.&quot; He indicated that the company doesn't expect the moves to have a large impact on revenue.    Despite projected savings of more than $150 million annually in operating and depreciation expenses from the action, Mr. Conway predicted that operating expenses for 1987 would be &quot;not much different&quot; from 1986 levels.    As previously reported, MCI announced Tuesday after the stock market closed that it would take a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge of $500 million to $700 million for equipment write-downs and restructuring. The company also said it would consolidate some operations, but declined at the time to say how many jobs would be eliminated.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, MCI closed at $7.125, up 62.5 cents, on volume of 6,440,400 shares.    MCI, the second-largest U.S. long-distance company, has seen its profits squeezed by rising costs and industrywide price cuts. Company officials have repeatedly said that MCI would remain profitable, but that goal has become increasingly elusive.    At the analysts meeting yesterday, MCI executives declined to make sales or earnings forecasts for 1987, saying results would depend on how much American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. cuts its rates.    &quot;The moves that we're making (will) make our company a stronger company rather than a weaker company,&quot; Mr. Conway said. He estimated that MCI's cash flow would improve by $200 million next year as a result of the restructuring.    The forecast improvement in cash flow includes a previously announced cutback of $100 million in planned capital spending and a projected savings of $100 million from operations.    MCI acknowledged it has been notified that the Communications Workers of America intends to use the layoffs as an argument for renewed efforts to organize the company's workers. Management will oppose such efforts, the company indicated.    &quot;We don't believe that having a third-party bargaining agent is the way to manage ourselves and our employees,&quot; an MCI spokesman said.    Workers whose jobs are eliminated will receive three weeks' pay plus two weeks of additional wages for each year of service. </TEXT></DOC>
