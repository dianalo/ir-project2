Diplomats who asked not to be identified said the NATO proposalsrequired further consultation after Greece began voicing objectionsto them early in the week.   NATO diplomats in Vienna and Brussels worked hard Wednesday toput the finishing touches to the proposal, billed by seniorofficials as an unprecedented effort to curb military exercises onthe world's most heavily armed continent.   But Greece objected to provisions mandating that maneuversrequiring the callup of 40,000 or more reservists and the use of1,200 or more armored personnel carriers be announced in advance,diplomatic sources said.   Athens, which is traditionally wary of NATO ally and neighborTurkey, was seeking lower limits, they said, adding they viewed thisas a ``psychological problem'' that could be overcome.   NATO and the Warsaw Pact also hope during this six-week round topresent what both sides bill as sweeping proposals on verification.   But diplomats from both military blocs, speaking on condition ofanonymity, have suggested they are finding it difficult to reconcileinterests within their two alliances.   U.S. Ambassador Stephen J. Ledogar said in an interview Wednesdaythat ``some tough problems'' have so far blocked a NATO compromiseon verification proposals.   He mentioned specifically differences between the United Statesand Canada, which are pushing for maximum verification, and Europeannations that are concerned this would mean almost constant visits bymilitary inspectors from the Soviet bloc.   But both Ledogar and a diplomat from another NATO nationexpressed confidence the verification proposals would be readyduring the current round of talks.   Soviet ambassador Oleg A. Grinevsky, in an interview with WestGermany's ZDF television station, announced Warsaw Pact intentionsof introducing sweeping verification proposals he billed as bolderthan anything NATO could produce.   Reiterating offers Western diplomats said had been made duringearlier closed-door negotiations, Grinevsky said the Soviet Unionwould even be prepared to countenance the permanent stationing ofNATO officers on its territory to check its compliance with eventualaccords to cut Europe's non-nuclear weapons. He revealed no otherdetails.   The 23-nation Vienna talks opened in March and, despitecontinuing differences over definitiions of weapons and whichcategories to cut first, have moved along briskly.   Most diplomats at the talks have dismissed President Bush's goalof agreement by year's end as too optimistic. But Ledogar said hethought it realistic to aim for some agreements by next year.   Grinevsky also told West German television that 1990 was arealistic target for preliminary agreement, after what he called the``unique breakthrough'' achieved in the first two rounds of talks.   President Bush has proposed limiting the United States and theSoviet Union to no more than 275,000 troops outside their borders inEurope.   The West wants no more than 20,000 tanks, 16,500 artillery piecesand 28,000 armored troop carriers for each alliance.   On the sensitive issue of aircraft, identifed by both East andWest as the biggest stumbling block of the talks, NATO proposes thatEast and West each be limited to no more than 5,700 combat aircraftand 1,900 combat helicopters.   No one country could have more than 3,420 combat aircraft and1,140 combat helicopters.   The Warsaw Pact in March proposed to reduce six kinds of weapons,including aircraft, by 10 to 15 percent by 1994, cutting by afurther 25 percent by 1997 and moving to purely defensive forces bythe year 2000.   The Soviet Union, which under Mikhail S. Gorbachev is clearlyanxious to save on military spending to meet pressing consumerdemands at home, has also begun unilateral troop withdrawals fromeastern Europe.   Some 50,000 Red Army soldiers and 5,000 tanks are to leaveHungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia by the end of 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
