Tiananmen Square, the center of student-led demonstrations andthe military crackdown in June, now is under military guard.Tuesday it will bustle with ceremonies marking the Aug. 1, 1927,founding of the first unit of what became China's Red Army.   The festivities come amid an official barrage of praise for theestimated 150,000 troops ordered into Beijing to stop thedemonstrations.   Last week, the Central Military Commission awarded the title of``Guardian of the People's Republic of China'' to 12 soldiers andofficers wounded or killed during the June 3-4 military assaults.   Orders conferring the award, signed by senior leader DengXiaoping, urged soldiers to ``follow their example, be loyal to thecountry and the people and dare to sacrifice for the interests ofthe people.''   At an Army Day banquet Monday, Defense Minister Qin Jiweitoasted the army, which he said ``faithfully performed itsfundamental duty and glorious mission ... for defending themotherland, safeguarding the peaceful labor of the people, andserving the people wholeheartedly.''   The fanfare has been building for days. Television programs showsoldiers being entertained by singers, marching bands and acrobatsin programs attended by China's highest officials.   Numerous books, movies and photo exhibitions have been producedshowing the official version of how the army subdued theprotesters. The accounts of angry crowds challenging the armedtroops express sympathy for the soldiers.   Official reports claim that when troops stormed into Beijing thenight of June 3 they showed great restraint and fired only whenprovoked. The government says more than 100 soldiers and police andabout 100 civilians were killed, including some innocent bystanders.   Western witnesses, however, said the troops firedindiscriminately, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of unarmedcivilians.   A People's Daily editorial claimed some civilians insulted andspat on the soldiers.   ``The young army men were angry and would not have tolerated thepersonal insults if they did not love the people,'' it said.   But witnesses said one taunt from the crowd could draw a barrageof fire from the young recruits.   The army has had a reputation of closeness to the people. Duringthe civil war against the Nationalist Chinese the army's ironcladdiscipline won support among China's peasants.   A slogan about the troops, noted for rescue work duringdisasters and help in harvesting crops, says the army ``goes withthe people like fish swim through water.''   During seven weeks of massive, peaceful demonstrations beforethe crackdown people felt confident enough to approach soldiers,offer them food and drink and lecture them on the army'sresponsibility not to hurt the people.   Until June 3 soldiers did act with restraint. There washigh-level opposition to the armed attack on the protesters, andsome units refused to take part. In the end, discipline and unityprevailed and the crackdown began.   For days afterward, people expressed outrage at the violence.   Now, after almost two months of repression and arrests, fewChinese dare voice anything but the party line.   An uneasy calm has settled over Beijing. Soldierswith automaticrifles are posted at only a few major intersections but rovingpatrols stop people late at night to check identification.   Relations between the military and public remain tense. Martiallaw troops reportedly have beaten and kicked arrested protesters.Most troops keep a low profile, occasionally emerging from bivouacsaround the city to see tourist attractions.</TEXT></DOC>
