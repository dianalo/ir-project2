The Ministry of Trade and Industry said that Samsung'splan to import technology to make large-sized specialvehicles from Nissan Diesel Motor Co. of Japan wouldundermine South Korea's auto industry, which has sufferedfrom sharp wage increases and shrinking exports in recentyears.</LP><TEXT>   The ministry, however, promised to re-evaluate theapplication by the South Korean business group after October1991.   The case has been a hot issue locally because theministry's decision amounts to a test of a new governmentpolicy to allow more competition among industries. In 1989,the government abolished an industry protection law, butretained the power to restrict imports of technology, such asthat proposed by Samsung.   Ministry officials added that the current shortage oflarge-sized commercial vehicles, such as dump trucks, will beresolved by next year when the present construction boomsubsides.   Samsung had sought government permission to makecommercial vehicles in Korea, citing an excessive demand ofthose vehicles relative to supply.   Currently, four companies in Korea make similar vehicles,but their output meets only about 70% of demand, estimated at20,000 trucks and 10,000 buses annually.   Existing local auto makers have strongly opposed Samsung'splan to assemble vehicles, fearing oversupply. The local automakers also presume that Samsung's eventual plan is to enterthe passenger car business, despite the group's repeateddenial of that intention.</TEXT></DOC>
