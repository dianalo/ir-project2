The unit of AMR Corp., Fort Worth, Texas, isn't the first to try to rein in the runaway bonus program. Last month, Allegis Corp.'s United Airlines unit announced a similar move and analysts predicted that other carriers would follow. Even Delta Air Lines, which initiated the triple-mileage awards seen as culprit in the out-of-control programs, recently introduced some new restrictions of its own.    &quot;The economics of frequent traveler programs have changed,&quot; said Mike Gunn, American's senior vice president, marketing. Echoing concerns heard throughout the industry, American said the old structure of its program didn't address questions about accounting practices, future liability or continued profitability for the airline should free-travel awards displace too many paying passengers.    Under the new program, American has created two categories of awards for travel. PlanAAhead awards will be given for lower mileage levels -- 20,000 miles earn one free coach ticket for travel in the continental U.S. and Canada -- but will be subject to restrictions, including limited seating and certain blackout dates. The other category, AAnytime awards, would use at least 40,000 miles, but have no blackouts or seating restrictions.    Also under its new program, American said its mileage credits will expire three years after they're earned. None of the changes affect miles accumulated by current members of its frequent-flier program through June 30, 1989, Mr. Gunn said. &quot;They will remain valid and can be used under the present AA award structure indefinitely,&quot; he added.    Like United's new plan, American's changes will take effect gradually, being phased in over the next 18 months. That pace has mollified would-be disgruntled passengers, who, for the most part, seem to understand that the freebies must be restricted or lost altogether. &quot;It's a disappointment to think that the bonus is over,&quot; said Dan Smith, director of consumer affairs at the International Airline Passengers Association. &quot;But it's a fact of life that the programs themselves were threatened.&quot;    Analysts and industry officials have been sharply critical of this year's triple-mileage programs, under which passengers flying a round trip in the first quarter qualified for triple mileage credit all year. Those are &quot;larger than practical discounts,&quot; said Robert L. Crandall, chairman and president of American, at the company's annual meeting last week. &quot;The triple-mileage inducements started by Delta Air Lines last year do not make sense. For competitive reasons, we have had no choice but to match Delta's program. However, we are concerned about the cost of such generous rewards.&quot;    Delta's senior vice president of marketing, W. Whitley Hawkins, said Delta considers its triple-mileage program a success, producing 800,000 new members. &quot;We don't see it as this awful monster it has been made out to be,&quot; he said. But even Delta recently curbed slightly the liberalness of its program, introducing some blackout periods it didn't have before. </TEXT></DOC>
