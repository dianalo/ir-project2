But the lack of a sales charge doesn't mean the fund is without cost.    &quot;It might be an exaggeration to call it a no-load,&quot; John Templeton, its founder, says. The new fund, Templeton Taft Philanthropic Trust, levies a so-called 12b-1 fee, which allows a fund to dip into its assets to pay certain marketing costs. Templeton's eight other mutual funds, with a total of $6 billion in assets, have sales charges of 8.5% but no 12b-1 fees.    The new fund's fee is 55 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. That plus its management and advisory fees make a total charge of about 1.3% annually. There is also a 1% exit fee for investors who leave the fund within three years.    Because the new fund has a $1 million minimum investment, some big non-profit investors might pay less by using the other Templeton funds, which reduce their sales charges to 50 basis points for investments of $2 million or more. However, many non-profit groups prohibit investment in such front-end load funds.    Richard Taft, president of Taft Group, a Thomson International Ltd. unit that helps locate funding for non-profit organizations, is an advisor to the fund. </TEXT></DOC>
