<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-61-1115 </DOCNO><TEXT>An improved process for the production of carbon monoxide by the steamreforming of hydrocarbons is described comprising: (a) catalyticallyreacting a fluid hydrocarbon feed stream with steam in a steam reformer;(b) passing the reformer effluent containing hydrogen, carbon monoxideand carbon dioxide from the steam reformer, without scrubbing to removethe carbon dioxide content thereof, to a pressure swing adsorption systemhaving at least four adsorbent beds, each bed of which, on a cyclic basis,undergoes a processing sequence; (c) recycling the carbon dioxide-richstream to the steam reformer for reaction with additional quantitiesof the hydrocarbon feed stream being passed to the stream reformer toform additional quantities of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, with productrecovery being enhanced and the need for employing a carbon dioxide washsystem being obviated.</TEXT></DOC>
