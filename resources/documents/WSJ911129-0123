For months we have supported aworkable crime bill designed to help the crime fighters andvictims, not the criminals,&quot; they wrote. &quot;As state and localleaders of the Democratic Party, it is hard to explain to ourconstituencies why our Democratic leaders in Congresscontinually hamstring our efforts to combat crime.&quot;   It was for naught. The House passed a bill that would helpcriminals. The prosecutors probably already understand thatthere is a Beltway-congressional-ACLU wing of the DemocraticParty and there is Everyone Else's Democratic Party. Theybelong to the helpless latter. Republicans in the Senateblocked the bill for now, but President Bush promises a vetoif Congress sends a bill that claims to fight crime butinstead fights prosecutors.</LP><TEXT>   Liberals in Congress have perfected the bait-and-switchdevice in blocking several Bush crime bills. The bill thatthe House passed would expand appeals from death sentences.Here, the Senate passed a version that would have streamlinedthe appeals, but the House added new ways for confessedmurderers on Death Row to appeal, including reversing aSupreme Court case that tried to limit the number oftechnical-issue appeals in the process. The House version wasadopted in the final bill. California Attorney General DanLungren worried that the bill would make it harder for hisstate to resume executions.   The same thing happened with the exclusionary rule, whereCongress declared President Bush's reform proposalsinadmissible on arrival. The House of Representatives passedwatered-down reform, but the Senate adopted a version thatwould be even more restrictive of juries' access to evidenceof guilt than under current law (again reversing a SupremeCourt case allowing more confessions to be heard by juries).The House-Senate conference adopted the pro-criminal Senateversion.   Just as Congress was devising ways to guarantee a veto,New Yorkers woke up to this page-one headline in the New YorkPost: &quot;Port Authority Brass to Bus Terminal Cops: DON'T MAKEDRUG BUSTS.&quot; The tabloid quoted a detective explaining whythere won't be drug surveillance anymore in the Gomorrah ofall bus stations. He explained that robbery cases &quot;areusually cut and dry -- little court time.&quot; In other words,less police time in court, less costly to process, lowerlabor costs. In contrast, defense lawyers inevitably fightdrug cases with exclusionary-rule arguments -- no warrant,the warrant had a typo, police didn't have reasonablesuspicion, Miranda warning in the wrong language.   Someone should keep a running count of the costs ofcomplying with the current Fourth Amendment tests for theexclusionary rule. Cost is now a huge disincentive toenforcing the law, especially with municipal budgets undertremendous strain.   Liberals in Congress want a waiting period for guns, butthey know there's no national registry of felons or thementally ill. The Brady bill would have no effect on crime.Meanwhile, the odds of committing a crime (with a gun ornot), getting caught, arrested, convicted and going to jailhave never been so low.   So long as we hobble law enforcement, crime in Americawill continue to be a rational endeavor. For now, Congress ispart of the problem.</TEXT></DOC>
