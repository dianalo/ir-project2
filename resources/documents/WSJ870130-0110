The banks, organized by Citicorp, last year contributed $500 million to a $1.6 billion bridging loan to Mexico. They have agreed to extend their part of this loan to April 30 from its original due date of today.    Meanwhile, bankers are striving to complete the $7.7 billion financing for Mexico, but about 100 banks -- which are being asked to contribute a total of about $340 million -- still must agree to join the lending group.    About half the banks still to join the package are in the U.S. Their number has been dwindling slowly, but Citicorp's chairman, John Reed, said that &quot;we're going to have to close the Mexican deal without all the banks.&quot; He and other bankers assert, however, that all the money will be collected even if a few banks drop out. That would mean that some banks currently in the lending group would have to contribute more money.    The complex $7.7 billion package was agreed upon last autumn as part of a $12 billion rescue to ensure that Mexico could continue to grow and service its estimated $100 billion foreign debt. The bank portion is made up of $6 billion in new loans to Mexico plus two further contingency loans: one of $1.2 billion, which will be lent to boost exports if Mexico's commerce founders; and another of $500 million, to spur the economy if Mexico grows at less than 3% a year. Banks agreed to contribute to the financing in proportion to what their loans outstanding to Mexico were in August 1982, the start of Mexico's severe debt difficulties.    Banks coordinating the financing have drawn in about 300 of the 400 creditor banks that were meant to contribute. Although that's only about 75% of the banks, the coordinators have obtained most of the funds: $7.36 billion of the $7.7 billion target, according to a banker close to the bank advisory committee coordinating the financing.    Bank of Boston, which in recent weeks had been the biggest U.S. bank contributor to stay out of the financing, this week relented and joined. &quot;We committed on Jan. 27,&quot; said a bank spokesman. He declined to specify what had held the bank back, beyond saying that &quot;we were waiting until we could bring all the elements to meet the conditions of the package.&quot; The spokesman declined to say how much Bank of Boston contributed to the financing, but other bankers estimated it at between $20 million and $30 million.    Other banks are still staying out, among them DG Bank of West Germany, officials and bankers close to the financing said. DG Bank disputes that appraisal of its position. &quot;We are in because we've told our regional coordinating bank and the Mexicans that we'll join in as soon as 90% of the commitments are confirmed without special conditions. As far as we know, that's not the case,&quot; said a spokesman for the bank in Frankfurt.    &quot;That's a cop-out,&quot; a U.S. banker, who declined to be identified, said. &quot;They're using that as a dodge, but they'll come in,&quot; he said.    A spokesman for Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks Inc. said the bank hasn't yet decided whether to join the Mexican package. He declined to say how much money the bank would contribute if it did join the financing, beyond saying he didn't think it amounted to much.    The U.S. banks still out of the package mainly have to each contribute comparatively small sums of money ranging from just a few hundred thousand dollars to a few million dollars. One U.S. banker estimated that only about five U.S. banks still have to contribute about $15 million or more each.    Mexican Finance Minister Gustavo Petricioli visited Washington and New York this week to talk with the Federal Reserve Board, the Treasury, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and Mexico's most important commercial bankers. He updated them on Mexico's economy, according to sources close to the Mexican financing, who provided no details.    A senior Mexican Finance Ministry official, Angel Gurria, also visited the U.S. this week, and Europe last week, in an effort to persuade more banks to join the $7.7 billion financing. </TEXT></DOC>
