 Since our department wants to install a localarea network, we are concerned about the availability of LAN adapter cardsthat are compatible with the PS/2s' Micro Channel architecture.andP;  What typesof cards are available for PS/2s?andP;  Paul Cunningham Boise, IdahoandM;IBM's strong effort to promote Micro Channel architecture is paying off.andO;3Com, along with many other companies, markets Micro Channel adapters forEthernet and Token-Ring configurations.andP;  A smaller number of companies,including Pure Data, are marketing Micro Channel ARCnet cards.andM;LESS IS MOREandM;I enjoyed your recent review of 3+Open LAN Manager (&quot;Building WorkgroupSolutions: 3Com's 3+Open LAN Manager,&quot; PC Magazine, February 28, 1989), but Iwas surprised to read that NetWare did not use all teh available RAM in theserver when the benchmark tests were run.andP;  Shouldn't the excess RAM have beenused for file caching?andP;  And why is it that upgrading the RAM in Novellservers does not always lead to an appreciable increase in performance?andO;Scott Feuless (via CompuServe)andM;Quite simply, NetWare does not benefit from having over 2.5MB of RAM in theserver.andP;  If the cache is too large, file management software can spend moretime loading, searching, and unloading the cache than it does delivering datato the application programs.andP;  This has a deleterious effect on performance.andM;The effectiveness of a disk cache in a file server always depends on how theapplication program asks for data.andP;  Most PC-based applications simply do notload enough sequential data to use a huge server cache.andP;  The algorithms usedto manage the cache are more important than its size.andP;  As our benchmark testsconsistently show, the NetWare cache managements scheme works very well.andM;SPECIFYING ENOUGH FILESandM;W recently ran into a problem with Excelan's networking software.andP;  It won'tinstall properly unless the statement FILES = 20 appears in the CONFIG.SYSfile.andP;  Apparently you only need FILES = 20 to install the program, not to runit.andP;  Why?andP;  Ron Glassman Denver, ColoradoandM;I ran into exactly the sample problem with Excelan's LAN Workplace for DOS.andO;It seems that many of us have a tendency to type INSTALL first and read thebook later.andP;  In its default, DOS will handle eight open files at one time.andO;Excelan's installation program needs to open more than eight filessimultaneously while configuring the software.andP;  Unfortunately, if theinstallation program fails, it doesn't tell you why.andP;  Manufacturers work hardto prepare documentation and hope we'll read it, but they shouldn't assumethat we will!andM;THE LAST MODEMSandM;YOU'LL EVER BUYandM;The ads for new modems are confusing.andP;  Some ads for V.32 modems discuss only9,600-bit per-second operation, while others display modems that claim tofollow the same standard but offer 9,600,2,400, and 1,200 bps.andP;  Are they allthe same?andP;  Steve Rigney Oxford, GeorgiaandM;V.32 is a communication standard that covers 9,600-bps full-duplex datatransmission.andP;  Last year, several companies released 9,600-bps modemscompatible with this standard.andP;  In the last few months, many companies,including Universal Data Systems and Racal-Vadic, have introduced modems thatcombine the V.32 standard with the V.22bits standard for 9,600, 2,400, andslower operation.andP;  I refer to these modems as &quot;the last modems you'll everbuy&quot; because they make optimal ue of both voice phone lines and the PC'sserial port.andM;Modems from competing companies will work together under good phone-lineconditions.andP;  There is no guarantee, however, that modems from differentcompanies will cooperate with each other when they have to negotiate a &quot;fallback&quot; to slower operation under poor line conditions.andP;  Therefore, it makessense to buy a high-speed modem that supports both the V.32 and V.22bisstandards.andM;INSTALLATION COSTSandM;I am planning to install a LAN for our company and I need some informationabout the costs of various wiring schemes.andP;  We are remodeling the buildingand can put in almost any kind of cabling we want.andP;  How do the costs oftwisted-pair, Ethernet, and Token-Ring compare?andP;  Jack Odem Montgomery,AlabamaandM;If you start from scratch, the cost of LAN wiring is divided between thecosts of material and labor.andP;  The May 1989 edition of the INMAC catalog listsbulk, nonplenum, 100-micron fiber-optic cable at $2.20 a foot, Token-ringcable at 40 cents a foot thin Ethernet coaxial cable at 28 cents a foot, andfour-pair twisted wire at 24 cents a foot.andM;There are a lot of contracts who know how to install twisted-pair wiring.andO;And the cable television industry took away the mystery of installing coaxialcable.andP;  But there are very few good fiber-optic contractors, or ones thatknow how to wire Token-Ring.andP;  I won't try to estimate labor costs, which areafeected by locale and the availability of knowledgeable contractors.andM;Companies often elect to have their own computer resource people plan andeven install LAN cabling with the help of a licensed electrical contractor.andO;Involving your own people in LAN wiring can save money, avoid mistakes, andfacilitate expansion.andM;To get a copy of the INMAC catalog, contact INMAC at P.O.andP;  Box 58031, SantaClara, CA 95052-9941; (408) 727-1970.andM;FIBER-OPTIC ANDandM;TWISTED-PAIR CABLESandM;Thank you for your review of Ethernet cards in the January 31, 1989, issue(Building Workgroup Solutions: Ethernet Cards).andP;  We are using it to evaluateproposals from LAN system integrators.andP;  However, your review didn't coveradapters using twisted-pair wire or fiber-optic instead of coaxial cable.andO;Aren't these good alternatives?andP;  James T. Burgee Los Angeles, CaliforniaandM;Twisted-pair wiring and fiber-optic cabling are good alternatives to coaxialcable for local area network systems.andP;  We didn't cover these wiring schemesbecause the physical connections for the fiber-optic and twisted-pair wiresare usually outside of the cards, in separate boxes called transceivers.andM;All Ethernet cards have a 15-pin transceiver jack in addition to the thinEthernet coaxial connector.andP;  A cable attached to this jack connects the cardto a small transceiver.andP;  The transceiver contains the connector and circuitryfor fiber-optic or twisted-pair wiring.andP;  Each adapter card needs a separatetransceiver.andP;  A transceiver for twisted-pair wire retails for somewhere inthe neighborhood of $149.andM;Many people are not aware that these alternative wiring plans require aseparate, and often expensive, wiring hub to buffer and manage competingmessages.andP;  Each fiber-optic cable or twisted-pair wire connects to the hub ina cental wiring cloet.andP;  A hub that is capable of hosting 12 stations ontwisted-pair wire retails for well over $2,000.andM;The hub wiring concept has several advantages over the thin Ethernetdaisy-chain beyond the distance advantage you gain from using fiber-optic ortwisted-pair.andP;  It can improve reliability because a single wire break doesn'ttake down the whole network as it does with a daisy-chain system.andP;  A hubequipped with diagnostic lights is a single troubleshooting point for theentire network.andP;  And, if price is important, be aware that transceivers andhubs can boost wiring costs quickly.andP;  Good old daisy-chained Ethernet isreliable enough for most applications and often is quite easy to install.andM;If you are interested in fiber-optic and twisted-pair alternatives to coaxialEthernet cabling, contact Optical Data Systems in Richardson, Texas; (214)234-6400.andP;  Optical Data has the most comprehensive and flexible line ofproducts we've seen in this market.andM;NETWORK YOUR QUESTIONSandM;Connectivity Clinic gives you practical solutions to networking problems ofall types.andP;  We'll pay $50 or more for any tips we print, plus an extra $25 ifyou submit your letter on a disk.andP;  If you do, please include a printed copy.andO;We'll gladly answer your questions at no charge, but we cannot answer letterspersonally.andP;  Mail contributions to Connectivity Clinic, PC Magazine, One ParkAvenue, New York, NY 10016 or upload them to PC MagNet (see the &quot;By Modem&quot;sidebar in the Utilities column).andP;  You may also contact Frank J.
