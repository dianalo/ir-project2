Sales totaled $1.61 trillion for the year, up 6.7 percent from1987 and the largest annual increase since a 9.8 percent gain in1984, the Commerce Department said.   But despite rosy expectations for strong year-end sales byretailers and car dealers, December sales were up just 0.2 percentfrom the previous month to a seasonally adjusted $138 billion.   December's gain was the slowest since a 0.3 drop in Septemberthat was followed by a revised 1.7 percent increase in October and a0.9 percent rise in November. The figures are not adjusted toexclude the effects of rising prices.   Economist David Wyss of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass.,said that while the overall sales figure for 1988 turned out to be``a lot better than we feared it was going to be after the stockmarket crash'' in October 1987, December's numbers were unexpectedlylow.   ``It suggests that we're entering 1989 with a lot less momentumthan we thought we had,'' Wyss said. ``I wouldn't call it a worryyet, but it does suggest that the economy is going to be slowingdown in 1989.''   Jay Levy of Levy Economic Forecasts in Chappaqua, N.Y., said thereport shows consumers ``have moved toward caution'' after a periodof more buoyant spending.   The bond market rallied in early action Friday as traders readthe sales figures as a sign of a slowing economy that would placeless upward pressure on interest rates.   However, some economists were skeptical about the implications ofthe report, saying December's weak numbers later might be revisedupward and that they might not reflect strong sales late in themonth, particularly of automobiles.   ``All I know is that auto companies were well satisfied with whatthey saw and the general merchandisers were well satisfied,'' saidRobert Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.   Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group in Washington, said that whileretail sales weren't as strong as expected for December, spendingstill showed modest growth that should continue into the new year.   While overall retail sales for the year were posting their bestshowing since 1984, the department store category rose by just 4.5percent, the smallest annual gain since a 3.4 percent rise in therecession year of 1982.   This sluggish performance was offset by a 9.5 percent rise inauto sales for the year, up sharply from a 1.8 percent increase in1987. However, auto sales actually fell in December, dropping 0.3percent from the previous month and posting the first decline sincea 1.4 percent drop in September.   Excluding autos, retail sales were up 0.3 percent in December,following a 0.6 percent rise in November.   Retail spending is seen as a key barometer of economic healthbecause it represents about one-third of the gross national product.The holiday season is particularly important because it can accountfor half of a general retailer's annual profits.   Sales by general merchandisers reached $15.76 billion inDecember, up 0.3 percent from a month earlier. Other categoriesposting gains during December included furniture stores, servicestations and bars and restaurants.   Sales decreased at food, clothing and drug stores.</TEXT></DOC>
