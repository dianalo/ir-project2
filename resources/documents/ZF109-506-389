Department of Motor VehiclesStructured Query Language.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Today's RDBMS Has the Power to PerformandM;Five or six years ago, IBM Corp. was touting relational database managementsystems as the solution for ad hoc analysis of corporate data.andP;  Relationalsystems provided the kind of flexible query capability needed for informationcenters, corporate planners and management analysts.andM;IBM was encouraging its customers just to download their data from IBM'sproduction IMS DBMS into its DB2 relational product.andM;When IBM announced DB2 in 1983, the relational DBMS was too slow to competewith large-scale database systems such as IMS.andP;  This, of course, was finewith IBM; competing with one's own product line is not considered smartmarketing.andP;  However, DB2 was ideal for the emerging information centermarket.andP;  It was powerful like its &quot;big brother&quot; IMS, but DB2 also wasflexible and easy to learn and use.andM;Managers needed access to the rich lode of data in their companies'databases.andP;  Data processing managers wouldn't let the uninitiated browsethrough the production systems for fear of disrupting their finely tunedoperations.andP;  An ill-formed query can slow down response time or even damagethe database, cutting into revenues.andM;Therefore, IBM proposed the information center concept as what some mightcall a &quot;computing sandbox,&quot; rich with powerful analytical tools but safelyisolated from the &quot;real&quot; database.andP;  DB2 and Structured Query Language (SQL)were flexible and &quot;user friendly,&quot; a popular phrase in those days.andM;Today, the situation is changing rapidly.andP;  The relational database productsthat once were viewed as toys are a force to be reckoned with.andP;  Advances inparallel processing, the SQL standard, and DBMS optimizers have maderelational approaches cheap and fast.andM;A relational DBMS lends itself to parallel processing.andP;  As computer makersget better at stacking up microprocessors, the cost of processing power,measured in transactions per second (tps), is plummeting.andM;Even though Oracle Corp. reported getting 265 transactions per second againsta 10-megabyte DBMS, the Amdahl Corp. Model 5890-600E system this test ran oncosts more than $14 million.andP;  The same application can run at 124 tps on a$1.2 million Symmetry system from Sequent Computer Systems Inc.andM;Reluctant to ChangeandM;Yet many ADP managers are reluctant to surrender their IMS, IDMS, S2K orother non-relational products.andP;  They point to the early days of DB2,disbelieving the incredible progress made since.andP;  In the words of databaseguru C.J.andP;  Date, &quot;Even today there is a common but unwarranted assumptionthat relational systems must be poor performers.&quot;andM;Of course, this trend started in California, where all trends seem to begin.andO;The California Department of Motor Vehicles is the largest in the UnitedStates.andP;  The agency maintains records on more than 30 million vehicles and 20million drivers licenses, the largest database on California residents.andP;  Thisdata must be available to law enforcement officials all the time anywhere inthe state.andM;Until 1989, the DMV ran the system on an IBM-based MVS assembler in a VSAMenvironment.andP;  Impressed with the power, speed and flexibility of relationalDBMS, the DMV elected to move in that direction.andP;  In the process of selectinga replacement system, the DMV benchmarked SQL on NonStop VLX multiprocessorsystems from Tandem Computers Inc.andP;  The results were impressive.andM;Codd and Date Inc. audited the November 1988 benchmark for the DMV.andP;  The28-processor NonStop VLX exceeded 30 tps for a 60-gigabyte database whileproviding a 1.5 second or better response time 95 percent of the time.andP;  TheTandem system met five of the six benchmark criteria and reached 29.8 tpswith 1.65 second response time for the sixth.andM;Tandem, which is known for fault-tolerant systems, also met this benchmarkwith a mirrored DBMS.andP;  Every transaction was done to two separate drives.andM;Other Tandem customers have or are building large SQL relational DBMSapplications.andP;  The Air Force's Military Airlift Command is converting fromHonneywell systems to a 50-gigabyte Tandem NonStop VLX supporting 10 tps to20 tps.andM;Litton Computer Services Division, Kraft Food Service and Pacific Bell allhave 20-gigabyte database systems with workloads of 15, 7, and 5 tpsrespectively.andP;  Rockwell International Corp. has a 10G database with 5 tps,and Kaiser Permanente runs 100 tps against its 50G database.andP;  Revco Inc. hasa 50G system, and Applied Risk Management has a 30G system, both supporting20 tps.andP;  Oracle Corp. also has impressive installations supporting on-linetransaction processing.andM;Some of Oracle's clients include Signet Bank with a 30G relational DBMS,McDonnell-Douglas Corp. with a 25G system, British Airways at 50G, and USWest Inc., which began at 11G but could reach 100G.andM;Teradata Corp., which makes database machines, has large-scale relationaldatabase systems installed with the Internal Revenue Service, ATandamp;T Co., MooreGovernmental Systems Inc. and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.andM;After looking at the evidence, I agree with Date's view that the relationaldatabase &quot;must now be the technology of choice for all application areas.&quot;andO;The price, performance and flexibility of relational systems are so dramaticthat application designers should have to explain why they aren't usingrelational products.andM;Walter R. Houser is responsible for information resources management andpolicy at a major federal agency.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
