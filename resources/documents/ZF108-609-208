The sensorsare located anywhere a backup could occur and are wired to adedicated programmable controller (PLC).andP;  An alarm is sounded bythe PLC whenever a jam is detected and the location of the problemis shown on the display.andP;  The capacitive sensors require almost nomaintenance time.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Efector Inc.
