The West German engineering concern said net climbed to 179 million Deutsche marks ($92.3 million) from 140 million marks a year earlier.    Sales advanced 9% to 10.263 billion marks from 9.374 billion marks, Mannesmann said in an interim report.    Seven out of Mannesmann's nine divisions posted higher profit. In the plant engineering unit, earnings were down because the year-earlier profit was bloated by the booking of a major order. In the Kienzle computer subsidiary, earnings were depressed by sharp price competition and high outlays for development and distribution efforts, Mannesmann said. </TEXT></DOC>
