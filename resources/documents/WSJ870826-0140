Thorn's lead underwriter and financial adviser, Goldman Sachs International Corp., said fewer than 1% of the shares were sold to Thorn's existing holders. The issue, which already had been placed provisionally with British institutions, is funding Thorn's planned $593.9 million purchase of Rent-A-Center Inc. of the U.S., announced last month.    Analysts said the poor reception reflected both uncertainty about the market outlook and skepticism about the strategy of the London-based electronics and entertainment company.    Thorn's share price had sunk well below the issue's per-share price of 695 pence ($11.25), so the investor response wasn't a complete surprise. London investors recently have been unusually jittery. &quot;This outcome isn't unexpected,&quot; Goldman Sachs said.    Goldman Sachs was sole adviser and lead underwriter to Thorn -- the first time a U.S. investment bank had played that role for a major British client. The reception appears to be a rebuke for Thorn's management, which made the takeover of Rent-A-Center, a Wichita, Kan.-based chain of rental stores, its first big expansion step after several years of retrenchment.    &quot;The institutions aren't convinced the quality of the earnings acquired was worth the premium price,&quot; said Simon Street, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., a London brokerage firm.    The poor reception for Thorn follows a string of poorly received issues in recent weeks. Following WPP Group PLC's purchase of JWT Group Inc., the U.S. advertising concern, WPP shareholders bought only 35% of the shares sold to pay for the takeover. WPP's shares, quoted in late trading yesterday at 820 pence, still are well below the 875-pence price paid by the institutions that underwrote the issue.    Trafalgar House PLC, a diversified company, raised about #300 million in a share offering this month to fund expansion in commercial property. As in the Thorn offering, shares were placed provisionally with institutions, but offered to existing shareholders. Trafalgar's share price has slid below the price of its offering, the results of which will be announced today. &quot;I don't expect a large number of shareholders&quot; to exercise their rights, said Ian Fowler, a Trafalgar House director. In the provisional placement, the institutions don't receive their shares only if existing holders exercise their rights to buy the additional shares.    Several other smaller issues haven't fared well in recent days -- suggesting the pace of takeovers may slow.    &quot;The underwriters have been getting it in the neck and obviously they'll be taking a more cautious attitude on what they will and won't underwrite,&quot; said Jeffrey Harwood, an analyst at the brokerage Phillips andamp; Drew.    A major test will be the huge rights offering by Blue Arrow PLC, the St. Albans, England-based employment services concern. Blue Arrow is raising #830 million, double its current market value, to fund its $1.33 billion takeover of Manpower Inc., the U.S. temporary-help company. Its share price is hovering just above the 166 pence a share offering price, and analysts are watching closely. &quot;The problem is the size of the issue,&quot; says Richard Dale, an analyst at the securities firm of James Capel andamp; Co. &quot;You're asking people to find a lot of money.&quot;    Blue Arrow's advisers at County NatWest Ltd. say they are as optimistic as when they launched the takeover bid. Nicholas Wells, executive director, predicts the recent nervousness won't last much longer. He also notes that unlike WPP, which raised its original bid for JWT by 25%, Blue Arrow sweetened its Manpower bid by only 10%. And he doesn't expect Blue Arrow to face reports of customer defections or staff resignations, as WPP faced.    He also predicts the government will work to maintain a favorable climate -- given its own late-October offering of #7.5 billion of shares in British Petroleum Co.    Thorn indicated it was torpedoed by the market's slump in the weeks since it announced its bid rather than by misgivings about its expansion into the rental business. &quot;It's a market phenomenon; I don't think it's a Thorn phenomenon,&quot; said Warren Finegold, a Goldman Sachs vice president. &quot;It's really a phenomenon of the last three weeks.&quot;    If investors calm down, he and others predict acquisition-minded British companies can resume their march. But whether prices have stabilized is, of course, a matter of opinion. &quot;Last week was the bottom of the uncertainty,&quot; Mr. Wells said. Mr. Dale said, &quot;I don't know which way this market is going.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
