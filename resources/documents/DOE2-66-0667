In the abstraction channelthe surfaces are only slightly different from the Stern--Persky--KleinGSW surface, but the exchange barrier on both surfaces is raised by inclusionof a three-center term fitted to ab initio extended-basis-set multireferenceconfiguration interaction calculations with scaled external correlation.The two surfaces differ significantly only for the steepness of H--Cl--Hbend potential. The exchange and abstraction saddle points are characterizedby harmonic analysis for H{sub 2}Cl, HDCl, and D{sub 2}Cl, and we alsocompute vibrationally adiabatic barrier heights including anharmonicity.We also report thermal rate constants and activation energies for bothreactions mentioned above.</TEXT></DOC>
