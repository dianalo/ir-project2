When the threaded connection of      a pushing ring to the joint body is advanced, a sealing force is applied      to the primary sealing. The inner ring has an inner diameter equal to that      of the joint body and that of the pipe, assuring a smooth movement of a      fluid in the pipe without the fluid remaining at the joint. </PAL></ABST><PARN> <PAR>  This is a continuation of co-pending application Ser. No. 07/407,658 filed      on Sep. 15,1989, now abandoned. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to a pipe joint made of resin to be suitably      used for a pipe used for a fluid which is a liquid having high purity or      ultrapure water, or which is a fluid adapted to undergo a change in      temperature. More specifically, the present invention provides a pipe      joint made of resin capable of assuring both excellent sealing properties      regardless of fluid temperature variations and good flowability enabling      the fluid to smoothly flow in the pipe without remaining at the pipe      joint. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  There is known a pipe joint made of resin of the type above-mentioned, for      example, as shown in FIG. 6. In FIG. 6, a cylindrical joint body A has a      pipe receiving portion into which an insertion portion b1 at one end of a      pipe B is to be inserted. The pipe receiving portion is provided at the      inlet thereof with a sealing tapering portion a1, the diameter of which is      gradually reduced in a direction toward the inside of the joint body A. An      outer ring D is provided at the inner end thereof with a sealing portion      d1 coming in contact with the sealing portion a1. The outer ring D is put      immediately outside of the insertion portion b1 of the pipe B. This causes      the pipe B to be locally pushed diametrically inward1y at b2. </PAR><PAR>  An external thread portion a2 at one end of the joint body A is threaded1y      connected to an internal thread portion el of a pushing ring E. By      forwarding such threaded connection, the outer ring D is pushed toward the      joint body A. This imparts a sealing force to the sealing portions a1 and      d1. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, the pipe B is regulated by the outer ring D so restricted as      to be axially immovable by the joint body A and the pushing ring E. This      prevents the pipe B from coming out from the joint body A. The inner      surface of the outer ring D is pressingly contacted with the projecting      portion b2 to generate a sealing force. This sealing force together with      the sealing force at the sealing portions al and d1, prevents leakage of      fluid to the outside in the pipe B and an entry of foreign matter into the      pipe B. </PAR><PAR>  However, the conventional pipe joint made of resin shown in FIG. 6 involves      the likelihood that, with the passage of time, the projecting portion b2      of the pipe B experiences stress relaxation which lowers the sealing force      between the inner surface of the outer ring D and the outer surface of,      the projecting portion b2, resulting in deterioration of the sealing      properties. This may provoke a micro-leakage of the fluid. Further, if the      fluid has a high temperature, the pipe B is softened to accelerate the      stress relaxation of the projecting portion b2. This results, in a short      period of time, in a decrease in the sealing force between the inner      surface of the outer ring D and the outer surface of the projecting      portion b2, causing the fluid to leak. </PAR><PAR>  There is also known a pipe joint as shown in FIG. 7. In FIG. 7, the joint      body A has a pipe receiving portion into which an insertion portion b1 at      one end of a pipe B is to be inserted. The pipe receiving portion is      provided at the inlet thereof with a sealing tapering portion a1, the      diameter of which diameter is gradually reduced in a direction toward the      inside of the joint body A. An inner ring F has a peripheral wall f having      a trapezoidal section, is pressingly inserted in the pipe B immediately      inside of the insertion portion b1 thereof. This causes the pipe B to      locally project diametrically outward1y at b3. An external thread portion      a2 at one end of the joint body A is threadably connected to an internal      thread portion e1 of a pushing ring E. By forwarding such threaded      connection, the projecting portion b3 of the pipe B and the inner ring F      are pushed toward the joint body A, so that the inclined surface of the      projecting portion b3 is pushed to the sealing portion al to generate a      sealing force. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, the projecting portion b3 of the pipe B is held by and between      the sealing portion a1 of the joint body A and a pressing portion e2 of      the pushing ring E and the peripheral wall f of the inner ring F. This      prevents the pipe B from coming out from the joint body A. Further, the      inclined surface of the projecting portion b3 is pushed to the sealing      portion a1 to generate a sealing force. This sealing force prevents a      leakage to the outside of the fluid in the pipe B and an entry of foreign      matter into the pipe B. </PAR><PAR>  In the conventional pipe joint made of resin shown in FIG. 7, the      spontaneous stress relaxation at an ambient temperature is less than that      in the pipe joint shown in FIG. 6. Accordingly, the pipe joint in FIG. 7      provides sealing properties slightly higher than those provided by the      pipe joint in FIG. 6. However, if the fluid has a high temperature, the      inner ring F directly exposed to the fluid is apt to be easily softened.      Accordingly, the stress relaxation of the inner ring F to decrease the      pushing force exerted to, the projecting portion b3 of the pipe B becomes      considerable. Thus, the sealing force is lost to cause the fluid to leak. </PAR><PAR>  In addition to the problems above-mentioned, the pipe joints made of resin      shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 present the following problems. </PAR><PAR>  In each of the pipe joints in FIGS. 6 and 7, the flow path of the pipe B is      not uniform in section. That is, the pipe B is locally reduced in diameter      due to the projecting portion b1 or the inner ring F. This prevents the      fluid from being smoothly moved. Particularly in the pipe joint in FIG. 7,      there is formed a fine gap between the outer surface of the peripheral      wall f of the inner ring F and the inner surface of the projecting portion      b3. This causes the fluid to remain in this gap. Accordingly, the pipe      joint in FIG. 7 is not suitable as a joint for a pipe used for a liquid      having a high purity or ultrapure water of which smooth movement is      required. This imposes restrictions on the use of such a pipe joint. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In view of the foregoing, the present invention is proposed with a main      object of: providing a pipe joint made of resin, in which an insertion      portion at one end of a pipe into which an inner ring is being pressingly      inserted to increase the inner diameter of the insertion portion, is      inserted into a pipe receiving portion at one end of a cylindrical joint      body; providing a strong force for preventing the pipe from separating      from the joint, while restraining stress relaxation regard1ess of fluid      temperature variations; and assuring excellent sealing properties at a      primary sealing and flowability enabling the joint to be applied for a      pipe used for a liquid having a high purity or ultrapure water. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of the present invention to provide a pipe joint made      of resin which provides, in addition to the primary sealing as      above-mentioned, a secondary sealing assuring excellent sealing properties      and enabling the stress relaxation to be restrained. </PAR><PAR>  To achieve the main object above-mentioned, the pipe joint made of resin in      accordance with an embodiment of the present invention comprises: </PAR><PAR>  a primary sealing portion formed at the inner part of a pipe receiving      portion of the joint body and extending in a direction crossing the axis      of the joint; </PAR><PAR>  an inner-end sealing portion formed in the inner ring and coming in contact      with the primary sealing portion; and </PAR><PAR>  a pushing ring threadedly connected to one end of the joint body, and      adapted to cause the primary sealing portion to come in contact with the      inner-end sealing portion to form a primary sealing when the threaded      connection of the pushing ring to the joint body is forwarded; </PAR><PAR>  the inner ring having an inner diameter equal to or substantially equal to      that of the pipe and that of the joint body. </PAR><PAR>  According to the pipe joint made of resin having the arrangement      above-mentioned, a strong sealing force is formed between the primary      sealing portion of the joint body and the inner-end sealing portion of the      inner ring when the threaded connecti,on of the end ring to the joint body      is forwarded or advanced. The primary sealing thus formed receives an      axial pressing force. Accordingly, stress relaxation is considerably      restrained not only at an ambient temperature but also at temperature      variations (increase). Thus, the pipe joint of the present ivnention      assures excellent sealing properties regard1ess of fluid temperature      variations, thereby improving sealing reliability. </PAR><PAR>  Further, the pipe is held by and between the joint body and the axially      immovable inner ring. This enables the pipe to be, maintained with a      strong force to prevent separation. </PAR><PAR>  The inner ring which does not prevent the fluid from being moved, is      pressingly inserted into the insertion portion of the pipe. Accordingly,      the flow path is uniform in section, assuring a smooth movement of the      fluid in the pipe without remaining at the pipe joint. Thus, the pipe      joint of the present invention may be suitably used as a joint for a pipe      used for a liquid having high purity or ultrapure water. </PAR><PAR>  The pipe joint made of resin in accordance with another embodiment of the      present invention comprises, in the pipe joint in accordance with the      embodiment mentioned earlier: </PAR><PAR>  a projecting portion formed on the outer periphery of the outer end of the      inner ring; and </PAR><PAR>  a secondary sealing portion formed at the inlet of the pipe receiving      portion of the joint body, and extending in a direction crossing the axis      of the joint; </PAR><PAR>  the secondary sealing portion being adapted to come in contact with the      outer peripheral sealing surface of the insertion portion of a pipe formed      at the time when the insertion portion is pressed to the projecting      portion, the outer peripheral sealing surface being diametrically inwardly      inclined in a direction toward the end of the pipe; </PAR><PAR>  the pushing ring being adapted to cause the secondary sealing portion to      come in contact with the outer peripheral sealing surface of the pipe to      form a secondary sealing when the threaded connection of the pushing ring      to the joint body is forwarded or advanced. </PAR><PAR>  The pipe joint having the arrangement above-mentioned, additionally      presents the following operational effects. </PAR><PAR>  A strong sealing force is generated also between the secondary sealing      portion of the joint body and the outer peripheral sealing surface of the      pipe. The secondary sealing also receives an axial pressing load.      Accordingly, stress relaxation is considerably restrained likewise in the      pipe joint in accordance with the embodiment mentioned earlier. Thus,      two-stage sealings including primary and secondary sealings, securely      prevent a leakage of fluid to the outside, as well as entry of foreign      matter into the pipe. </PAR><PAR>  The pipe joint made of resin in accordance with a further embodiment of the      present invention comprises, in the pipe joint in accordance with the      first-mentioned embodiment; </PAR><PAR>  an outer ring put on the insertion portion of a pipe; </PAR><PAR>  a secondary sealing portion formed at the inlet of the pipe receiving      portion of the joint body, and extending in a direction crossing the axis      of the pipe joint; and </PAR><PAR>  an inner-end sealing portion formed at the outer ring and coming in contact      with the secondary sealing portion; </PAR><PAR>  the pushing ring being adapted to cause the secondary sealing portion to      come in contact with the inner-end sealing portion to form a secondary      sealing when the threaded connection of the pushing ring to the joint body      is forwarded or advanced. </PAR><PAR>  The pipe joint having the arrangement above-mentioned, additionally      presents the following operational effects. </PAR><PAR>  The insertion portion of the pipe at one end thereof is held by and between      the axially immovable inner and outer rings. Accordingly, the pipe may be      maintained with a strong force for preventing the pipe from separating out      from the joint. Further, a strong sealing force is also generated between      the secondary sealing portion of the joint body and the inner-end sealing      portion of the outer ring in a state where stress relaxation may be      considerably restrained. </PAR><PAR>  Other features and effects of the present invention will be apparent from      the following description. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a section view of a half portion of a pipe joint made of resin in      accordance with the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2A and 2B are section views of portions of a variant of a primary      sealing formed in the pipe joint in FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a section view of a further variant of the primary sealing; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a section view of a half portion of a pipe joint made of resin in      accordance with another embodiment of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a section view of a modification of the pipe joint in FIG. 4; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 and FIG. 7 are, respectively, section views of half portions of      conventional pipe joints made of resin. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  The pipe joint made of resin in accordance with the present invention has a      joint body 1 made of resin having characteristics excellent in chemical      resistance and heat resistance such as PFA, PTFE, ETFE, CTFE, ECTFE or the      like, an inner ring 2 and a pushing ring 4. </PAR><PAR>  The joint body 1 is cylindrical and has a pipe receiving portion 10 at one      end thereof. A first primary sealing portion 11 is formed at the inner      part of the pipe receiving portion 10 and extends in a direction crossing      the axis C of the pipe joint. A secondary sealing portion 12 is formed at      the inlet of the pipe receiving portion 10 and extends in a direction      crossing the axis C. The pipe receiving portion 10 is provided on the      outer periphery thereof with an external thread portion 13. The pipe      receiving portion 10 has an inner diameter greater than the inner diameter      of a trunk 14 of the pipe joint. The first primary sealing portion 11 is      formed by a tapering surface which is gradually inclined from the inner      part of the pipe receiving portion 10 toward the axis C. The secondary      sealing portion 12 is formed by a tapering surface which is gradually      inclined from the intermediate part of the pipe receiving portion 10 in a      direction away from the axis C. That is, the secondary sealing portion 12      is formed at the inlet part of the pipe receiving portion 10. </PAR><PAR>  The inner ring 2 is provided at the inner end thereof with a fitting      portion 20 having such an outer diameter as to be fitted in the pipe      receiving portion 10 of the pipe joint 1. The inner ring 2 has a pressing      insertion portion 21 which is continuous with the fitting portion 20. The      pressing insertion portion 21 has a diameter smaller, by an amount      corresponding to the thickness of a pipe 5, than that of the fitting      portion 20. The inner ring 2 is generally made in the form of a sleeve.      The inner diameter of the inner ring 2 is the same as that of the pipe 5      and that of the trunk 14 of the joint body 1. This assures a smooth      movement (flowing) of a fluid in the pipe 5. The inner ring 2 is provided      at the inner end thereof with an inner-end sealing portion 22 having a      tapering surface adapted to come in contact with the first primary sealing      portion 11. </PAR><PAR>  The inner ring 2 is provided on the outer surface of the outer end thereof,      i.e., on the outer surface of the outer end of the pressing insertion      portion 21, with a tapering outer-end sealing portion 23 the diameter of      which is gradually increased in a direction from the outer end thereof to      the inner end thereof, and of which outer end crosses the inner surface of      the inner ring 2. The top portion of the outer-end sealing portion 23 has      a diameter greater than that of at least the pressing insertion portion 21      as a connecting portion with respect to the fitting portion 20. In FIG. 1,      the outer diameter of the sealing portion 23 is greater than that of the      fitting portion 20 of the inner ring 2. That is, the greater-diameter      portion of the outer-end sealing portion 23 is formed as a projecting      portion 24 having a section in the form of a mountain, which is formed on      the outer peripheral surface at the outer end of the inner ring 2. The      inner ring 2 has a tapering surface 25 which is gradually inclined from      the top of the projecting portion 24 toward the axis C. The tapering      surface 25 is inclined at the same angle at which the secondary sealing      portion 12 of the joint body 1 is inclined. The tapering surface 25 is      formed such that the distance between the secondary sealing portion 12 and      the tapering surface 25 is corresponds to the thickness of the pipe 5,      when the inner-end sealing portion 22 comes in contact with the first      primary sealing portion 11. </PAR><PAR>  The inner ring 2 having the arrangement above-mentioned is coupled      integrally to the pipe 5 with the pressing portion 21 being inserted into      one end of the pipe 5, causing the peripheral wall thereof to      diametrically project. At this time, the projecting peripheral wall of the      pipe 5 serves as an insertion portion 50 to be inserted into the pipe      receiving portion 10 of the joint body 1. When the insertion portion 50 is      inserted into the pipe receiving portion 10, the inner-end sealing portion      22 comes in contact with the first primary sealing portion 11 of the joint      body 1 and the outer-end sealing portion 23 comes in contact with the      inner surface of an inclined portion 51 of the insertion portion 50.      Further, a portion of the insertion portion 50 of the pipe 5 is inclinedly      held by and between the secondary sealing portion 12 of the joint body 1      and the tapering surface 25 of the inner ring 2. That is, the outer      peripheral surface of the pipe 5 parallel with the tapering surface 25,      serves as an outer peripheral sealing surface 30a. </PAR><PAR>  A pushing ring 4 has a cylindrical body 40. The cylindrical body 40 is      provided on the inner peripheral surface thereof with an internal thread      portion 41 to be threadedly connected to the external thread portion 13 of      the joint body 1. The cylindrical body 40 is also provided at the outer      end thereof with an annular pushing piece 42 projecting toward the axis C.      The pushing piece 42 is provided at the diametrically inward and inner end      thereof with a pushing edge portion 44. The pushing edge portion 44 is      formed at a position near to the axis C with respect to not only the top      of the projecting portion 24 of the pressing insertion portion 21 but also      the outer peripheral surface of the adjacent portion to the fitting      portion 20. </PAR><PAR>  The pushing ring 4 having the arrangement abovementioned is adapted to push      the inner ring 2 toward the joint body 1 through the pipe 5 (more      specifically, the joint body 1 and the inner ring 2 are pushed toward each      other), and to push the pipe 5 toward the joint body 1 (more specifically,      the joint body 1 and the pipe 5 are pushed toward each other). Thus, the      pushing ring 4 provides a sealing force so as to maintain the joint body      1, the inner ring 2 and the pipe 5 integrally coupled to one another. </PAR><PAR>  According to the arrangement above-mentioned, when the pressing insertion      portion 21 of the inner ring 2 is first inserted into the end of the pipe      5, the end of the pipe 5 is generally increased in diameter. That portion      of the pipe 5 corresponding to the projecting portion 24 of the inner ring      2 is formed as the insertion portion 50 the inner diameter of which is      further increased. The inner ring 2, the insertion portion 21 of which is      being inserted into the end of the pipe 5, and the insertion portion 50 at      one end of the pipe 5, are inserted into the pipe receiving portion 10 of      the joing body 1. This causes the inner-end sealing portion 22 to come in      contact with the first primary sealing portion 11. Then, the pushing ring      4 previously put on the pipe 5 is threadedly connected, at the internal      thread portion 41 thereof, to the external thread portion 13 of the joint      body 1. By forwarding or advancing such threaded connection, the joint      body 1 is strongly fastened, causing the pipe 5 to be connected to the      joint body 1. </PAR><PAR>  By connecting the pipe 5 to the joint body 1 in this way, the insertion      portion 50 of the pipe 5 is held by and between the joint body 1 and the      pressing insertion portion 21 of the axially immovable inner ring 2.      Further, the insertion portion 50 is locally held by and between the      outer-end sealing portion 23 of the inner ring 2 and the pushing edge      portion 44 of the pushing ring 4. Accordingly, the pipe 5 is held with a      strong force to prevent separation, thereby to prevent the pipe 5 from      movingly coming out from the joint body 1. </PAR><PAR>  When the threaded connection of the pushing ring 4 is forwarded to strongly      fasten the joint body 1, the first primary sealing portion 11 of the joint      body 1 is pressingly contacted with the inner-end sealing portion 22 of      the inner ring 2 to generate a strong adhering force therebetween. In the      resin pipe joint shown in FIG. 1, the secondary sealing portion 12 of the      joint body 1 is also pressingly contacted with the outer peripheral      sealing surface 30a of the pipe 5, and the outer-end sealing portion 23 of      the inner ring 2 is also pressingly contacted with the inner surface of      the inclined portion 51 of the pipe 5. Thus, a strong sealing force is      generated between the secondary sealing portion 12 and the outer      peripheral sealing surface 30a, and between the outer-end sealing portion      23 and the inner surface of the inclined portion 51. Accordingly, the pipe      5 is sealed at both outer and inner peripheral surfaces thereof. </PAR><PAR>  More specifically, this resin pipe joint assures a so-called primary      sealing, i.e., a sealing inside of the flow path, at two points, i.e.,      between the joint body 1 and the inner ring 2 and between the inner ring 2      and the pipe 5. Thus, this pipe joint provides excellent sealing      properties to securely prevent a leakage of fluid and entry of foreign      matter into the pipe 5. Further, this resin pipe joint also assures a      so-called secondary sealing, i.e., a sealing outside of the flow path      between the joint body 1 and the pipe 5. Accordingly, even though creep or      the like in a heat cycle causes trouble in the primary sealing      above-mentioned, this secondary sealing prevents a leakage of an fluid and      an entry of foreign matter. This enhances the sealing reliability.      Further, in this resin pipe joint, an axial pushing force is exerted to      all three sealing portions by the cooperation of the joint body 1 and the      pushing ring 4. This considerably restrains the sealing properties from      being destroyed due to stress relaxation not only at an ambient      temperature but also even though the fluid temperature is increased.      Accordingly, the excellent sealing properties may be assured. </PAR><PAR>  Further, the inner ring 2 has an inner diameter equal to the inner diameter      of the pipe 5 and equal to the inner diameter of the trunk 14 of the joint      body 1. The flow path is therefore uniform in section. This does not      prevent smooth movement of the fluid. Thus, the pipe joint of the present      invention assures such flowability as to smoothly move the fluid without      remaining in the pipe at the pipe joint. Accordingly, this pipe joint may      be applied for a pipe used for a liquid having a high purity or ultrapure      water. </PAR><PAR>  In the resin pipe joint shown in FIG. 1, the inner-end sealing portion 22      of the inner ring 2 is inclined at the same angle at which the first      primary sealing portion 11 of the joint body 1 is inclined. However, the      inner-end sealing portion 22 may be inclined at an angle different from      the angle at which the first primary sealing portion 11 is inclined, as      shown in FIG. 2A. In this case, the inner-end sealing portion 22 may be      pressingly contacted with the first primary sealing portion 11 with a      pushing force generated by the threaded connection of the pushing ring 4,      as shown in FIG. 2B. According to such an arrangement, a strong sealing      force may be concentrated particularly on inward ends 6 of the first      primary sealing portion 11 and the inner-end sealing portion 22, thereby      improving the function of restraining the fluid from remaining in the      pipe. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 3, the first primary sealing portion 11 and the inner-end      sealing portion 22 may extend in a direction at a right angle to the axis      C. A concave portion 7 may be formed in one member (for example, the      inner-end sealing portion 22), while a convex portion 8 to be fitted to      the concave portion 7 may be formed in the other member (for example, the      first primary sealing portion 11). </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a section view of a half portion of the pipe joint made of resin      in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 4,      like parts are designated by like reference numerals used in FIG. 1. In      the following, the description of the like parts is not made. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 4, the pipe joint made of resin comprises a joint body 1, an inner      ring 2a, an outer ring 3 and a pushing ring 4. </PAR><PAR>  The inner ring 2a has a fitting portion 20 similar to the inner ring 2      mentioned earlier. The inner ring 2a has a pressing insertion portion 21a      different from the pressing insertion portion 21 mentioned earlier which      has the tapering surface 25. More specifically, the pressing insertion      portion 21a is provided on the outer periphery at the outer end thereof      with an outer-end sealing portion 23a. The inner diameter of the outer-end      sealing portion 23a is gradually increased in a direction from the axial      outer end to the axial inner end thereof. The outer end of the outer-end      sealing portion 23a intersects the inner peripheral surface of the inner      ring 2a. However, the maximum outer diameter of the outer-end sealing      portion 23a is the same as the outer diameter of a connecting portion for      connecting the pressing insertion portion 21a to the fitting portion 20.      Accordingly, the pressing insertion portion 21a is not provided on the      outer periphery thereof with a projecting portion. In this connection, an      insertion portion 50a of a pipe 5 at one end thereof into which the      pressing insertion portion 21a of the inner ring 2a is being pressingly      inserted and which is pressingly inserted into a pipe receiving portion 10      of the joint body 1, is merely increased in diameter uniformly in its      entirety. When this insertion portion 50a is inserted into the pipe      receiving portion 10, an inner-end sealing portion 22 of the inner ring 2a      comes in contact with a first primary sealing portion 11 of the joint body      1 and the outer-end sealing portion 23a comes in contact with an inclined      portion 51 of the pipe 5, but the pipe 5 does not come in contact with a      secondary sealing portion 12 of the joint body 1. </PAR><PAR>  The outer ring 3 has an inner diameter which permits the outer ring 3 to be      put on the insertion portion 50a of the pipe 5, and an outer diameter      slightly smaller than the inner diameter of an internal thread portion 40      of the pushing ring 4 threadedly connected to an external thread portion      13 of the joint body 1. The outer ring 3 is provided at the inner end      thereof with a tapering inner-end sealing surface 30 which comes in      contact with the secondary sealing portion 12. The outer ring 3 has an      outer end 31 extending in a direction at a right angle to the axis C of      the joint body 1. This outer end 31 is adapted to come in contact with an      inner end surface 43 of a pushing piece 42 of the pushing ring 4. </PAR><PAR>  In the resin pipe joint shown in FIG. 4, the inner end surface 43 of the      pushing piece 42 of the pushing ring 4, serves as a pushing surface for      pushing the outer ring 3. Accordingly, the pushing ring 4 pushes the inner      ring 2a toward the joint body 1 through the pipe 5 (more specifically, the      joint body 1 and the inner ring 2a are pushed toward each other), and also      pushes the outer ring 3 toward the joint body 1 (more specifically, the      joint body 1 and the outer ring 3 are pushed toward each other). Thus, the      pushing ring 4 works so as to hold the joint body 1, the inner ring 2a,      the outer ring 3 and the pipe 5 coupled in a unitary structure with a      sealing force applied thereto. </PAR><PAR>  According to the resin pipe joint shown in FIG. 4, the insertion portion      50a of the pipe 5 into which the pressing insertion portion 21a of the      inner ring 2a is being pressingly inserted, is inserted into the pipe      receiving portion 10 of the joint body 1. This causes the inner-end      sealing portion 22 to come in contact with the first primary sealing      portion 11. Then, the inner-end sealing surface 30 of the outer ring 3      previously put on the pipe 5, comes in contact with the secondary sealing      portion 12 of the joint body 1. Then, the internal thread portion 40 of      the pushing ring 4 is threadedly connected to the external thread portion      13 of the joint body 1. By forwarding or advancing such threaded      connection, the joint body 1 is strongly fastened to connect the pipe 5 to      the joint body 1. </PAR><PAR>  According to the arrangement above-mentioned, the insertion portion 50a of      the pipe 5 is held by and between the pressing insertion portion 21a of      the inner ring 2a and the inner peripheral surface of the outer ring 3,      and the insertion portion 50a is also locally held by and between the      outer-end sealing portion 23a of the inner ring 2a and the pushing edge 44      of the pushing ring 4. Thus, there is,formed a force for preventing the      pipe 5 from seaparating from the joint. </PAR><PAR>  As to the sealings provided by forwarding the threaded connection of the      pushing ring 4, there are formed, in the same manner as in the resin pipe      joint shown in FIG. 1, the primary sealings between the first primary      sealing portion 11 of the joint body 1 and the inner-end sealing portion      22a of the inner ring 2a, and between the outer-end sealing portion 23a of      the inner ring 2a and the inclined portion 51a of the pipe 5. </PAR><PAR>  According to the resin pipe joint in FIG. 4, the secondary sealing is      formed when the secondary sealing portion 12 of the joint body 1 is      pressingly contacted with the inner-end sealing surface 30 of the outer      ring 3. As apparent from the foregoing, the outer ring 3 is pushed      directly by the inner end surface 43 of the pushing ring 4. This causes      the ratio of the secondary sealing force to the primary sealing force to      be higher than that in the resin pipe joint shown in FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  In the resin pipe joint in FIG. 4 too, the flow path is uniform in section,      assuring a smooth movement of the fluid without remaining in the pipe. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 5, the secondary sealing portion 12 of the joint body 1      and the inner-end sealing surface of the outer ring 3 may be formed in      tiers by two pressing contact surfaces 301a and 302a which extend in a      direction at right angle to the axis C and are axially displaced from each      other. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
