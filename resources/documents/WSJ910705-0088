If the nation's large and medium-sized supermarkets andgroceries balk at posting or distributing nutritioninformation in their fresh produce and seafood sections,Congress has directed the FDA to turn the voluntary programinto a mandatory regimen, conceivably as early as the springof 1994.</LP><TEXT>   The agency is carrying out provisions of the 1990Nutrition Labeling Act that require uniform listing ofcalories, fat, sodium and nutrients per serving of food.   The proposed voluntary program may affect as many as99,000 retailers, the FDA says. It takes corporatevolunteerism to new lengths, asking the supermarket industryto spend as much as $165 million in the next 20 years onso-called point-of-sale distribution of nutrient information.The agency also proposes to give the industry extraordinarylatitude in devising ways to inform health-minded anddiet-conscious consumers about the nutrient values of the 20most frequently eaten varieties of raw fruit and vegetables,as well as of fresh fish and shellfish.   The labeling program undoubtedly will change the face ofsupermarket aisles. For example, FDA officials envision bigsigns hanging in supermarket aisles, placards posted next topyramids of fruit, stacks of nutrition brochures, booklets onhooks and even in-store video displays. Many supermarketchains and large independent groceries already are doing suchthings.   &quot;It's terrific the FDA is moving forward,&quot; says DagmarFarr, spokeswoman for the Food Marketing Institute. &quot;Theguidelines won't rob supermarkets of their marketingflexibility.&quot;   The voluntary program is seen by many as an opportunity toboost already booming sales. The United Fresh Fruit andVegetable Association, which represents the $30 billionproduce industry, plans to coordinate nutritional labelingwith its Fresh Approach generic promotion effort.   The produce industry makes much of polls showing that mostshoppers base their choice of supermarket on the variety andquality of the produce on sale. Typically, supermarkets carry260 different types of fruit and vegetables, up from just 60a decade ago, says George Dunlop, president of the tradeassociation.   The National Fisheries Institute, which represents seafoodprocessors and retailers, hedges its endorsement. &quot;We thinkit's a good move,&quot; but only if the Agriculture Departmentsets comparable labeling standards for meat and poultry, addsLee Weddig, executive vice president of the institute. &quot;If wedon't get uniformity, the consumer won't be well served byall the expense and effort going into nutrition labeling,&quot; hesays.   The FDA guidelines reflect months of research into theeating habits and label-reading tendencies of U.S. consumers,as well as the marketing practices of grocers, fish sellersand supermarkets. The guidelines, among other things, covertrimmed vegetables, such as carrot sticks and broccolistalks; whole or filleted fish; live lobsters; andpasteurized shrimp and crab. The top 20 list of vegetablesdoesn't include peas, which are usually sold frozen orcanned.   The agency plans to base serving sizes on the amount offood commonly consumed. The standard serving for most fruitswould be five ounces, with exceptions such as watermelon,which usually is eaten in large wedges. The agency proposes atwo-ounce standard for lettuce, onions, mushrooms, tomatoesand other salad ingredients, and a 3 1/2 ounce standard forother raw vegetables. Pieces of fruit commonly eaten all atonce, such as apples and pears, will be regarded as a singleserving. The basic serving size for fish will be four ouncesbased on cooked weight.   Retailers will be given the option of using a simplifiedor a full label. The latter lists calories, fat,carbohydrates, protein, sodium, vitamin A, vitamin C, calciumand iron per serving. If a particular food has only traces offive or more nutrients, retailers can opt for the simplifiedlabel, which just lists calories, fat, carbohydrates, proteinand sodium.   But if retailers make nutrient claims or declare aspecific amount of an additional nutrient present, as withpotassium in iceberg lettuce, they must add a qualifyingstatement that lettuce isn't an important source of calciumor iron.   Congress set Nov. 8 as the deadline for voluntarycompliance. The FDA will inspect a representative sampling of2,000 supermarkets and grocers to assess the extent ofcompliance and will report its findings by May 8, 1993. If60% of them are properly providing nutrition information onat least 90% of the fruit, vegetables and fish involved, theagency will allow the voluntary program to continue. But ifcompliance falls short of that target, the nutrition labelinglaw requires that the program become mandatory by May 8,1994.   Congress exempted from voluntary labeling all restaurants,delicatessens and self-service food bars, as well as roadsidestands and grocery stores with annual sales under $500,000.Also exempt are food distributors that sell to restaurantsand other food service establishments.   The bulk of the voluntary labeling will be done by 31,000large chain stores and independent grocers with annual salesof $2 million or more. They account for more than 81% oftotal U.S. grocery sales.</TEXT></DOC>
