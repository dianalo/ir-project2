Jimmy Swaggart's refusal to stopappearing on two television shows produced by his ministry led theChristian Broadcasting Network to drop the programs, a CBNspokesman said.   ``We had given Swaggart by mail a period of time to decidewhether to comply with our request that he not appear in theshows,'' Earl Weirich, spokesman for the Virginia Beach, Va.-basedcable TV network, said Sunday.   ``If he wasn't (going to appear) we would continue to carry theshows. But we were notified that he thought that was not in thebest interest of Swaggart's evangelical association,'' said Weirich.   The decision deprives Swaggart of the largest network carryinghis shows. CBN carries religious shows, children's shows,documentaries, reruns of old TV series and family entertainment tonearly 37 million homes, the spokesman said.   Swaggart's ministry paid to air the shows, which had an averageviewership of 40,000 to 80,000 homes, said Weirich, who was in LosAngeles for the annual convention of the National Cable TelevisionAssociation.   On Sunday, the network canceled the weekly hour-long broadcastof services from Swaggart's Louisiana church. It also pulled aweekday morning Bible study called ``A Study in the Word,'' whichwas replaced with a half-hour animated children's show of Biblestories called ``Flying House.''   The cancellations follow Swaggart's refusal to accept a yearlongpreaching suspension ordered by national directors of the Assembiesof God denomination. That followed a three-month suspension by theAssemblies' Louisiana directors after Swaggart confessed publiclyto unspecified sins, which reportedly involved voyeurism with a NewOrleans prostitute.   Swaggart has said he will resume preaching May 22.   In the letter to Swaggart about two weeks ago, CBN offered toretain the programs if he remained off them for the year, Weirichsaid.   A spokesman for Swaggart could not be reached because he doesnot take calls on weekends.   According to figures released by Arbitron last month, Swaggart'sweekly show had an audience of 1.961 million households in Februaryand the daily show was watched by 323,000 households.   On Sunday, Swaggart, promising he would try to never againcriticize anyone, appealed for $6 million to save Jimmy SwaggartMinisteries during one of his few national television appearancessince his unexplained ``moral failure.''   Swaggart, who was joined by his wife, Frances, and son, Donnie,said he was appearing neither as a preacher nor a teacher. He saidhe was continuing to abide by his self-imposed, 90-day ban on thoseactivities.   Swaggart did not talk about his alleged indiscretion or histroubles with the Assemblies of God during the taped, hour-longtelecast. It aired in time slots that had featured Swaggartpreaching until his confession Feb. 1.   Swaggart said the ministry's budget was devastated by hisproblems.   ``We have to raise the funds if we are to keep the ministrygoing,'' Swaggart said. ``Stations will cancel if we cannot paythem. We cannot pay them what we do not have.''</TEXT></DOC>
