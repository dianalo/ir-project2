<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-39-0085 </DOCNO><TEXT>Radiation therapy and limited resection give equally good results in earlysquamous cell carcinomas of the nasal vestibule, each producing localcontrol rates of 90% or more. For more extensive disease, primary radiationtherapy with surgery reserved for residual or recurrent carcinoma isrecommended in view of the significant cosmetic defects which generallyfollow major resection. Small and superficial lesions can be treatedby external beam therapy or interstitial implants. Large or infiltrativelesions are best managed by external beam therapy. Serious late morbidityfollowing irradiation is uncommon and has been reported in fewer than5% of patients. Regional nodal metastases are diagnosed at the time offirst presentation in about 5% of patients and signal a very poor prognosis.However, the data available do not support elective treatment of clinicallyuninvolved regional nodes. Fewer than 5% of patients manifest late nodalmetastases when the primary tumor area remains free of recurrence, andmost of these metastases can be controlled by neck dissection and/orirradiation.</TEXT></DOC>
