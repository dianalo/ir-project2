Mikhail G.Shadrin, an assistant naval attache at the embassy.;    Wilson, using the nameJohn Stuart, mentioned a figure of 3 million pounds ($4.8 million), the courtwas told, and Madrichyk laughed so hard that Wilson had to hold the telephoneaway from his ear.;    But it was apparently no laughing matter to MI5.;   MI5 and the police took out advertisements in the personal columns of localnewspapers that made it look as if Madrichyk had suffered pangs of remorse.;   &quot;John Stuart from Alexander M.,&quot; began one. &quot;You should not telephone us onour London numbers. Please understand that they cannot be used to discuss suchmatters. Also I am not an expert in this business. Instead please telephone mycolleague Nick who wants to help you.&quot;;    Plot hatched over beer;  Wilson andhis cohort had almost forgotten about the plot by then, perhaps because, asthey told the court, they had dreamed it up over glasses of bitter. But Wilsonspotted the ad and contacted &quot;Nick&quot; from a telephone booth.;    Nick tried toimitate a Russian accent in his negotiations, but kept forgetting that theRussian word for &quot;yes&quot; was &quot;da,&quot; not &quot;ja.&quot;;    As they zeroed in on theequally inept would-be spies, who kept using the same telephone booth, thepolice and MI5 agents took photographs, but forgot to remove the lens cap. Atone point, as Price was driving Wilson away, they noticed people takingfingerprints from the booth.;    It was last September, after the ninth call,with Wilson now demanding $3.2 million, that the police finally arrested thetwo.;    Wednesday, both pleaded guilty to breaking the Official Secrets Act.Both were sentenced to 15 months in prison.;    The Times of London reportedthat since their arrests Wilson and Price have become known to their fellowinmates as Glasnost and Perestroika.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  London  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910714  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  472  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday July 14, 199100196069,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
