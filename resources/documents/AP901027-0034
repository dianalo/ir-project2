PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The plea bargain turned out to be nobargain.   Rather than take chances on a jury verdict, Russell Barnesaccepted a prosecutor's offer and pleaded guilty to one count ofaggravated robbery in a mugging. In return, five other charges weredropped.   The decision cost him at least 3{ years in prison: Momentsearlier, the jury had found him innocent of all charges.   James Campbell, a Ramsey County District Judge, said he decidedto let the jury read its verdicts Thursday night for the benefit ofattorneys who argued the case and to make a court record in case ofappeal. The judge asked Barnes whether he wanted to hear theverdicts. He did.   By then, the judge had accepted the guilty plea and it was toolate to withdraw it.   ``It was like O. Henry meets Alfred Hitchcock,'' said RichardColeman, Barnes' public defender.   Coleman said Barnes ``went into shock, and so did his lawyer.''His client's mother burst into tears. A juror, misinterpreting thetears and the defendant's reaction as relief, came up tocongratulate Barnes, 19, of St. Paul.   Coleman said his client acted against his advice. ``My positionhad been to stick with the jury verdict, but I can understand hisfear.''   If convicted of all six charges, Coleman said, Barnes would havefaced up to 20 years in prison, about a third of the time off forgood behavior. Under the plea bargain, he is to be sentenced tofive years and four months, and is expected to have to serve atleast two-thirds of it.   Barnes was charged in an August incident in which he and othersallegedly beat a St. Paul woman, her two sons and a friend androbbed them of $600.   Jurors, who began deliberating Tuesday, twice said they weredeadlocked, and Campbell decided to declare a mistrial at 9:30 p.m.Thursday if there was no verdict. But at 9:30 the jurors said theywere making progress and wanted to continue deliberating.   About 10:45 p.m., Coleman said, he called Campbell's chambers tosay his client had decided to accept the plea agreement prosecutorsoffered earlier. Three assault charges and one each of burglary andsimple robbery were dropped in exchange for the plea to aggravatedrobbery.   Coleman then found out jurors had just told the bailiff they hada verdict. But Barnes stuck by his decision and entered his pleaabout 11 p.m. He entered a special plea under which he did notadmit committing the crimes but conceded that he could be convictedbased on the evidence.</TEXT></DOC>
