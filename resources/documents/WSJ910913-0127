The same thing happens, we take it from this week'sevents, in Washington. Exhausted by the prosecutorial furiesof Watergate, Iran-Contra and Robert Bork, our government isre-enacting itself as a three-ring circus.   In ring one we have Joseph Biden expounding on NaturalLaw. The following, honest to God, is taken directly fromyesterday's Clarence Thomas hearing as provided by theFederal News Service.</LP><TEXT>   Senator Biden: &quot;Okay. I'm beginning to understand. So,natural law informed the notion of liberty. You and I haveboth read -- because of our backgrounds, I suspect -- we'veboth read -- I won't get into Aquinas and Augustine and allthat, but Locke looked back to the concept of natural law asan evolving notion. Montesquieu talked about it. Jeffersonunderstood it. He was in Paris. He was probably the only onethat fully understood it. But others who were there writingthe Constitution, they talked about it, they had what theywrote -- both the Declaration, as you say, in other placesand in the Constitution -- they reduced these broad notionsof natural law -- the natural rights of man to thisdocument.&quot;   Who needs to stay up till midnight for &quot;Live at theImprov&quot; when you can spend your day hours with Biden, Kennedyand Metzenbaum -- the Senate progeny of Adams, Madison andFranklin?   Senator Biden: &quot;All right, well, Judge, if tradition andhistory -- what happens if the tradition and historyconflicts with what we -- you and I -- would believe to bethe natural law meaning that the Founders had at the time,even though it has been reduced to positive law, the word`liberty' was reduced to positive law in 1866. Tradition andhistory demonstrated when that happened, for example, womendidn't have the right to vote. Women were not allowed to beanything from lawyers to whatever. So you look at traditionand history and you conclude obviously they didn't have womenin mind, yet when you look at the natural law principle theyhad in mind, they must have had women in mind when they talkabout all men and the rights of individuals. Now when theyconflict, natural law underpinning of the Founders or theFramers of that amendment's notion in history, which do youchoose?&quot;   In ring two we have Clark Clifford, the grandest andoldest of the Beltway's grand old poseurs, explaining thatthe rogues at BCCI never controlled his First American Bankbecause while he followed orders from the rogues he alwaysthought they were merely passing along instructions from Arabinvestors. Thus his representations to banking authoritieswere entirely kosher.   Clifford's brazenness seems almost admirable, come tothink of it, compared with professions of shock by some ofhis interlocutors, which reminds us of Claude Raines'sdiscovery of gambling in Casablanca. Our favorite was Rep.Joseph Kennedy II, declaring the Clifford escapades &quot;adisplay of corporate arrogance and corruption.&quot; No, Joe Jr.,it was a display of Beltway sleaze.   In a little sideshow diversion, to be sure, financialregulators are making big noises about beating up on bonddealers for elbowing each other in the marketplace. But theregulators seem to have things to explain themselves. A memohas surfaced saying William Ryback of the Federal Reserveturned down important BCCI documents because they might besubpoenaed by Manhattan DA Robert Morgenthau. It was all amisunderstanding, the Fed officially explained. Two Fedofficials will appear on today's edition of Weekday AfternoonLive to explain that this was entirely different from SalomonBrothers' practical joke.   In ring three the latest act of the most expensivecriminal prosecution in history, Lawrence Ahab's pursuit ofthe Great White Ollie. In overturning the conviction ofOliver North, the appeals court said he could be retried, butonly if Judge Gerhard Gesell cleaned the Augean Stables bydetermining that none of the 67 witnesses has been tainted byrevelations from Mr. North's congressional appearances.   A little trouble erupted when witness No. 1, RobertMcFarlane, stunned the prosecution by saying that of coursehe was tainted by the North appearance: &quot;I was affected. Howcould I not have been? I was not alone. Ask Peter Jennings.Ask tens of millions of Americans.&quot; This drove the Walsh teaminto near hysterics; they shouted that this statement of theobvious was a deliberate attempt to torpedo their case. Mr.McFarlane snapped, &quot;I've had enough of this.&quot; We hope JudgeGesell was listening carefully.   Philosophers say that people get the government theydeserve. Or as P.T. Barnum put it, &quot;There's a sucker bornevery minute.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
