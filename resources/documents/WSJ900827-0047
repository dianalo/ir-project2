The call-up, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and theestablishment of a U.S. force in Saudi Arabia, has raiseddelicate issues for employers. Not only must they shufflework forces because of job vacancies, but they must alsodecide how -- and if -- reservists are to be paid if calledup. Benefits, too, both for the employee and for theemployee's dependents, pose another question.</LP><TEXT>   The sudden crisis in the Persian Gulf has caught mostemployers off-guard. Many, ranging from small businesses tocorporate giants such as Xerox Corp. and InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. don't even know how many reserviststhey employ. &quot;We really have no handle on this,&quot; said a Xeroxspokesman. &quot;Until they get called up, we have no idea of whois a reservist and who is not.&quot; Of 29 employers responding toa poll by consultant Hewitt Associates, only three said theyhave a significant number of reservists.   Questions of pay and benefits for reservists are equallydifficult. Employers aren't required to pay active-dutyreservists, but some make up the difference between themilitary and regular pay for a time. Many companies aremaintaining their usual pay plans, but some quickly acted tobolster the package. Union Pacific Corp. promised to make upany difference in pay or benefits indefinitely. Insurer USAAwill be paying employees called to duty the difference in payfor 12 months; health and insurance benefits will bemaintained for two years.   In the Hewitt survey, 11 companies said they wouldn'tcontinue the reservists' pay. Another nine said they'd makeup the salary shortfall for periods from two weeks up to sixmonths. Of the others that responded to the pay question, sixplanned to continue pay for varying periods. In a similarsurvey by consultant Towers Perrin, 13 of 22 employers saidthey wouldn't continue the employee's pay, while nine saidthey would (three for just two weeks).   In general, employers weren't concerned that criticalemployees might be called up, but there are notableexceptions. At General Motors Corp.'s Saturn subsidiary,Bruce G. McDonald, the unit's vice president forcommunications, is a brigadier general in the Army Reserve.Mr. McDonald says that, for now, he doesn't expect to becalled up, which may be fortunate for Saturn. The GM unit isdue to launch its first car this fall.   The call-up also could put a kink into the space shuttleColumbia mission that is set to be launched Sept. 1. John&quot;Mike&quot; Lounge, a physicist, is one of three missionspecialists scheduled to fly aboard the shuttle, and areservist with the U.S. Air Force. The National Aeronauticsand Space Administration isn't sure how it would handle thesituation if Mr. Lounge were to be called up, but aspokeswoman said, &quot;The mission wouldn't be scrapped.&quot;However, no replacement would be fielded.   Concern about the call-up is felt even at the smallest ofemployers. At the Cortland Christian Church in tiny Cortland,Ohio, Pastor Tom C. Gibson is nervously awaiting a possiblecall. Mr. Gibson can't be sure of keeping his particularposition, but he is trying to work out an agreement withchurch elders to hold his job and pension and hire an interimminister if he is called. Last Sunday, the congregationgathered in its century-old white frame church and prayed fora peaceful resolution in the Gulf.   Here are the plans of employers in a variety of industriesfor handling the reserve call-up:   Most auto makers don't know how they will be affected byPresident Bush's call-up of the reserves, but the initialimpact looks minimal.   Ironically, the U.S. plants of Japanese auto makers may bemore affected than Big Three plants. That's because theJapanese &quot;transplants&quot; have far younger work forces than BigThree factories, where the average age of workers is about 45years old.                                                                                                          AUTOS                                                                                                          At Diamond-Star Motors Corp., an auto-making joint venturebetween Chrysler Corp. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp., about 4%of the company's 3,000 employees are reservists. At ToyotaMotor Corp's. plant in Georgetown, Ky., 139 of the 3,350employees are reservists.   Most companies, including GM and Ford Motor Co., saythey're studying what to do about the pay issue, and willannounce their decisions soon. GM makes up the differencebetween civilian and military pay for 30 days, but isstudying whether to extend that. GM already gives salariedemployees a slightly more generous break than hourlyemployees, but it's uncertain whether that will continue.                                                                                                          COMMUNICATIONS                                                                                                          Some communications companies moved to bolster pay toreservists called up to active duty. Nynex Corp., whichbelieves it has some 300 to 500 reservists, enhanced itsprogram for military reservists by extending the time it willpay the difference between an employee's salary and militarypay to six months from two weeks. Group insurance programswill be continued at current levels.   Pacific Telephone, Pacific Telesis Group's telephoneoperating company, said some 766 employees are activereservists. The phone company has 61,000 employees. Vacanciesmay be filled by temporary help, the company said.   For reservists who have worked for Pacific Tel for morethan a year, salary differences will be made up for threemonths if they have no dependents and up to six months ifthey have dependents. For employees with less than a year ofservice, the difference will be made up for one week. Pac Telwill continue benefits until the military starts to pay forthem. Reservists won't lose tenure for up to five years.   Bell Atlantic Corp. doesn't know how many of its employeesare reservists, but it sweetened its benefit package forthose called to active duty.   Employees with dependents at Bell Atlantic will receivesalary differential payments for six months if they have beenwith the company for more than a year; those with less than ayear at the company will receive it for 3 1/2 months. Foremployees with no dependents, the differential pay is forthree months and two weeks, respectively.                                                                                                          HIGH TECH                                                                                                          Like IBM and Xerox, many high-tech companies are trying tofigure out what effect the call-up may have.   &quot;We're just assessing what the impact might be,&quot; saidGeorge Burger, vice president of human resources at TandyCorp. The company doesn't know how many of its 39,000employees are reservists. But its Radio Shack retail outletsare already feeling the pinch in areas around military bases,where full-time military personnel frequently work part-timeas Radio Shack clerks.   E-Systems Inc. surveyed its divisions recently and foundthat only about 50 of its 18,000 employees could be affectedby a call-up of the reserves. E-Systems will continue toprovide insurance and other benefits to reservists and theirfamilies for six months.   Digital Equipment Corp. had just six employees out of125,000, called to active duty as of last week. The total isexpected to rise as reservists get their orders in comingdays.                                                                                                          POLICE   Like corporate America, police forces are trying to assessthe impact of the callup. The assessments vary widely.   In Jackson, Miss., the police are hoping that not all 23of their policemen in the reserves are called up anytimesoon. The department, which has about 350 policemen, isalready about 75 officers short, partly because of attrition,partly because of a budget squeeze. The force expects tobring on 18 new police recruits in November. But, says Sgt.Chip Pippen, &quot;If we lose 23 people, it would deplete ourranks pretty good.&quot;   Mayer A. DeRoy, chief of police in Pittsburgh, said heexpects up to 24 of his force's 1,150 officers, ranging fromthe lowest in rank up to commanders, to be called. &quot;This willspread us a little bit thinner,&quot; said Chief DeRoy. &quot;But itwon't wreak havoc on the city of Pittsburgh.&quot;   At the Georgia Department of Corrections, 390 correctionalofficers, or 7% of the state's total, are reservists. Aspokesman said the corrections department immediatelydeveloped contingency plans to ensure that the level ofsecurity wasn't diminished. In some cases, officers will workovertime to fill vacancies caused by reservists. Certain workprograms outside the facilities, such as prisoner's pickingup litter along highways, may be curtailed or cut altogetherto be sure there are enough bodies to guard the jails.                                                                                                          SMALL BUSINESS                                                                                                          According to the National Federation of IndependentBusiness, the largest membership organization forsmall-business owners with about 600,000 members, somesmaller firms still are confused about their obligations toreservists and have begun calling NFIB's Washingtonheadquarters for information.   One potential problem is that most business owners areassuming that the reservists will be on active duty for ashort period of time, perhaps three to four weeks, said NFIBspokesman Terry Hill. He notes that small business would beseriously hurt if they lose key employees or the owner andchief executive for an extended time.   &quot;We're very concerned. There are so many aspects to thisthing, no one knows which way it'll go,&quot; he said.                                                                                                          DEFENSE                                                                                                          Martin Marietta Corp. estimates that fewer than 1,000 outof its total work force of 65,000 are reservists. Marietta isstudying the financial impact this crisis might have onemployees and their dependents. No new policy or changes havebeen developed yet.   United Technologies Corp. said it would continue to payemployees who are called up for active reserve duty thedifference between their military pay and their normalsalaries, and would continue all benefits. A spokesman forthe Hartford-based company said the extra pay would beextended for 90 days from departure, and that the policywould be re-evaluated at that time.   The company estimates that roughly 1,000 of its 115,000U.S. employees are in the military reserves. By late Fridayafternoon, none had informed the company that they had beencalled to active duty.   Boeing Co. hurriedly began sorting its personnel files forreservists among its 160,000 employees world-wide late lastweek in an effort to determine how many might be affected.Although the count hadn't been completed by Friday, a Boeingspokesman said it may have a &quot;large number&quot; of test pilotsand aircraft maintenance workers who are in the reserves.Boeing makes up the difference between reservists' regularpay and military pay for as many as 20 days of military dutyover a two-year period.                                                                                                          HEALTH CARE                                                                                                          The University of Illinois Hospital's and Clinics inChicago is bracing for the worst. &quot;It could cripple some ofour hospital services&quot; if its reservists are called, aspokeswoman said. Although she didn't know how many of thehospitals 150 doctors and 1,100 nurses are reservists, &quot;thereare key staff members, departments heads and head nurses, whoare members of the reserves. They're not the type ofemployees you could replace easily.&quot;   Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas said it doesn't knowhow many of its employees are in the reserves but it hasidentified about a dozen employees, none doctors, who belongto the reserves. But of those, three are nurse midwives.   FHP International Corp., a health maintenance organizationwith 7,500 employees, said 75 employees, or 1% of its workforce, are in the reserves, and that the potential for beingcalled up has already had a broad effect on the company. &quot;Youlose some productivity when people are uncertain and worriedabout what is going to happen to them,&quot; says Wanda Lee, vicepresident of human resources.   Earlier this week, the company began intensifying itsrecruiting efforts, contacting temporary services forphysicians and nurses, alerting them that they will be inneed of personnel in the coming months. Unfortunately, othermedical companies are doing the same, and shortages mayresult, Ms. Lee said.                                                                                                          AIRLINES                                                                                                          Airlines may be hit particularly hard by the call-upbecause both pilots and aircraft are needed. Out of some7,500 to 8,000 Delta Air Lines' pilots, several hundred arereservists. A few pilots have been called up sporadically inrecent days. A Delta spokesman says the airline has beenfilling in the vacancies as it normally does, with pilots onstandby to substitute. &quot;We don't anticipate any scheduledisruptions,&quot; he said.   A spokesman for AMR Corp.'s main carrier, AmericanAirlines, said that 22 of its 8,500 pilots had been called upfor active duty. American said it suspended a regularlyscheduled daily round-trip flight on each of two routes,Dallas/Fort Worth-Honolulu and Newark-Los Angeles, freeing uptwo DC-10 aircraft, which American said the government hadrequested to shuttle personnel and cargo to the Middle East.A company spokesman noted that two daily flights are stillavailable on each route.   AMR's regional carrier division, AMR Eagle, said that 86of its 5,200 employees, including 52 of about 1,500 pilots,had been contacted by the military. &quot;We aren't losing a lotof people from any one place,&quot; said a spokesman.   On the ground, Union Pacific, went a step further thanmany firms, promising to make up any difference in pay orbenefits indefinitely. A company spokesman said Friday thatabout 400 of Union Pacific's 48,000 employees are activereservists, but he didn't know how many of them had beencalled up.</TEXT></DOC>
