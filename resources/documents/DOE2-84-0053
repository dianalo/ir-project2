The experimentsare based on observables constructed from the momentum and spin vectorsof epithermal neutrons and from the spin of an aligned or polarized target.It is shown that the proposed tests are detailed balance tests of time-reversalinvariance. The status of the experiments is briefly reviewed.</TEXT></DOC>
