The move to shore up the dollar only temporarily braked its fall, as the currency continued to weaken in early Tokyo trading, slipping below 150 yen.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar dropped 0.9% to 150.03 yen, from 151.35, slowed only by the fear that the U.S. or Japanese central bank might intervene against the yen.    The Federal Reserve Bank apparently didn't act. The Bank of Japan, though, intervened in early Tokyo trading Tuesday as the dollar continued its plunge to 148.60 yen -- eclipsing the low of 150 set in intraday New York dealings Monday. &quot;Obviously the market is going to be a little nervous now, but we're still looking for a continuing weak dollar,&quot; said Philip Brewster, general manager, treasury, at Royal Bank of Canada in Tokyo.    In New York trading yesterday, dealers were trying to determine whether the Federal Reserve Bank was in the market, buying dollars with yen. They generally concluded that the U.S. central bank wasn't an active participant, although the Fed apparently made some calls to banks about currency price quotes. &quot;They had more than a superficial interest,&quot; one trader said.    The dollar's drop also depressed the U.S. credit markets, helping to drive down bond prices.    Traders said the dollar's slide yesterday was prompted by Treasury Secretary James Baker's remark in a British television interview Sunday that the U.S. doesn't have a target for the dollar's value. Mr. Baker had been asked whether the dollar's current level is in line with economic fundamentals, as suggested by the Feb. 22 Paris accord among the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada.    Since that agreement -- which called for stabilization of exchange rates among the six countries -- the dollar has gradually declined against the yen while trading in a relatively narrow range against most other major currencies.    The dollar's value against the Japanese currency has dropped more than 2% from its pre-Feb. 22 level of 153.58 yen.    Against the bellwether European currency yesterday, the dollar fell 0.6% to 1.8175 West German marks, from 1.8285, just fractionally below its pre-accord level of 1.8183.    Some traders attribute the dollar's current decline against the yen at least in part to seasonal pressures. Japanese exporters are selling large quantities of the U.S. currency so they can repatriate their profits before the Japanese fiscal year ends next Tuesday.    Continued downward pressure on the U.S. currency is expected from this operation as well as from dollar-selling by Japanese companies who hold U.S. investments and are seeking protection against a further dollar decline.    &quot;There are many potential sellers in the Tokyo market,&quot; Masakazu Miyamori, senior vice president and chief trader at Sanwa Bank Ltd., New York, said.    Mr. Miyamori said that, regardless of Bank of Japan intervention, the dollar probably will fall to 145 yen by the end of next month. He said central bank action &quot;may be able to hold the dollar at 150 for a couple of days.&quot;    Iida Toshihiko, senior yen dealer at Westpac Banking Corp., New York, said, &quot;Sentiment is very, very bearish against the dollar.&quot;    The British pound rose strongly yesterday to $1.6185 from $1.6042.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for March delivery climbed $4.60 an ounce to $410.20 in brisk trading estimated at 4.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $411.25 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Monday, March 23, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
