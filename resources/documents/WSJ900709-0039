The report, produced for Congress by the Centers forDisease Control, estimates that the direct and indirect costof those injuries -- the leading cause of death amongchildren -- exceeds $8 billion.</LP><TEXT>   Both the number of fatalities and the cost to societycould be significantly reduced, the study suggests, ifschools, local governments and families placed added emphasison injury prevention.   &quot;Many people think of accidents as random andunpredictable and, therefore, as unpreventable,&quot; said Juan G.Rodriguez, a physician and specialist on injuries at the CDC.&quot;But they can be controlled; they can be prevented.&quot;   Researchers found that in 1986, the most recent year forwhich figures are available, 22,411 children age 19 andyounger died from the five leading causes of injuries:motor-vehicle accidents, homicide, suicide, drowning andburns.   The rate of deaths (the number per 100,000 population)linked to injuries actually fell 22% between 1968 and 1986,the study shows, partly because of improvements in autosafety and other preventive measures. Over the same period,however, the death rate due to disease dropped more than 50%.   &quot;The efforts, the money and the research have gone intodiseases, but injuries haven't received that kind ofattention,&quot; Dr. Rodriguez said. &quot;With the same type ofeffort, we could decrease the impact of injuries onchildren.&quot;   Almost half of the injury-related fatalities in 1986stemmed from auto accidents. Of those 10,500 deaths, between15% and 30%, according to the CDC, were linked to alcoholuse.   Homicide, the second-largest category among fatalinjuries, accounted for nearly 13% of the childhood deaths.While the majority of these fatalities occurred among youthsage 15 to 19, almost one-quarter -- 660 homicides -- involvedchildren under the age of five.   The third-leading cause of fatal injuries was suicide,accounting for 2,151 deaths in 1986. Among children age 10 to19, males accounted for 80% of the suicides. Of those, anestimated 60% involved firearms. Drowning, burns and othermiscellaneous categories accounted for almost 7,000 deaths.   About 20% of all hospitalizations among U.S. children stemfrom injuries, including nearly 16 million emergency-roomvisits. In all, more than 30,000 children each year arepermanently disabled because of their injuries.   That toll, the report suggests, could be cut by, amongother actions, increased use of air bags in autos, reducedaccess to firearms, and improved identification and referralsof individuals at high risk for suicide.</TEXT></DOC>
