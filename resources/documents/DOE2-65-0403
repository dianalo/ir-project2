The ion beam current densityamounted {similar_to} 300 {mu}A/cm/sup 2/ with ion fluence of 6 x 10/sup17/ ions per cm/sup 2/. It is found that highly intensive ion bombardmentpromotes the formation of a layer of silicon carbide of cubic modification({beta}-SiC) with first- and second-order twins deep in the sample. Theelectron diffraction analysis of the planar and back sides of bombardedsilicon plates exhibit the availability of {beta}-SiC inclusions on theirsurfaces.</TEXT></DOC>
