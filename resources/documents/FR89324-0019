Regulations implementing the FMP are at50 CFR Part 672. Section 672.20(a) of the regulations establishes an optimumyield range of 116,000-800,000 metric tons (mt) for all groundfish speciesin the Gulf of Alaska. TACs for each target groundfish species and speciesgroup are specified annually. For 1989, TACs were established for eachof the target groundfish species and species groups and apportioned amongthe regulatory areas and districts.An overall TAC for pollock equal to 60,000 mt has been specified for theCentral and Western Regulatory Areas, combined. For purposes of managingpollock, the Secretary adjusted the TAC under authority of andSection; 672.22of the regulations (see 54 FR 6524, February 13, 1989) such that no morethan 6,250 mt of pollock could be harvested in an area called ShelikofStrait. The Regional Director reports that 3,850 mt of pollock have beenharvested through March 14, 1989. Current daily catch rates by vesselsdeliverying to shoreside processors and by catcher/processor vessels isabout 400 mt per day. At this catch rate, the balance of the TAC will beharvested by 12:00 noon a.s.t., March 21, 1989.Therefore, pursuant to andSection; 672.20(c)(2), the Secretary is prohibitingfurther retention of pollock in Shelikof Strait effective 12:00 noon, a.s.t.,March 21, 1989. Any catches after that date must be treated as prohibitedspecies and discarded at sea.Overharvesting the portion of the pollock TAC from the combined Centraland Western Regulatory Areas that is intended to be taken from the ShelikofStrait will result unless this notice takes effect promptly. NOAA thereforefinds for good cause that prior opportunity for public comment on thisnotice is contrary to the public interest and its effective date shouldnot be delayed.Public comments on the necessity for this action are invited for a periodof 15 days after the effective date of this notice. Public comments onthis notice of closure may be submitted to the Regional Director at theaddress above until April 4, 1989. If written comments are received whichoppose or protest this action, the Secretary will reconsider the necessityof this action, and, as soon as practicable after that reconsideration,will either publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> a notice of continued effectiveness of the adjustment,responding to comments received, or modify or rescind the adjustment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>This action is taken under andSection; 672.20 is in compliance with ExecutiveOrder 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 672</ITAG>Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 16 U.S.C. 1801, <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Joe P.
