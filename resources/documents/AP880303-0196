(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The PTL television ministry said Thursdayit is banking on a telethon to help it make quarterly payments tothe Internal Revenue Service ordered by a federal bankruptcy judge.   The Fort Mill-based ministry, hit by hard times since the fallof founders Jim and Tammy Bakker, was ordered by U.S. BankrupctyJudge Rufus Reynolds to make payments of $550,000 to the IRS everythree months to settle tax debts.   Reynolds settled on the amount Wednesday after the IRS arguedfor payments of $800,000 a quarter and PTL agreed to payments of$300,000 a quarter. The first payment is due May 2.   ``It looks like the projections indicate we'll be able to meetthe May 2nd obligation,'' said M.C. ``Red'' Benton, the ministry'sexecutive vice president.   The success in meeting the payments will greatly depend on a PTLtelethon that began Monday and will run through the end of Marchwith the goal of raising $4.5 million above normal donations, hesaid.   The payment is meant to be an interim settlement on PTL's debtto the IRS and could be adjusted each quarter if necessary,Reynolds ruled.   The IRS has said the total tax bill is between $61.8 and $82million, while PTL has maintained the bill is closer to $5 million.   Determination of the final bill is still before the U.S.Bankruptcy Court, which has been handling the case since PTL filedfor reorganization June 12.   In a separate action last week, attorneys for the IRS and PTLargued in U.S. District Court over Reynold's decision to preventthe tax agency from revoking PTL's tax exempt status while theministry reorganizes. A ruling in that case is expectedsoon.   PTL's bankruptcy trustee, David Clark, told Reynolds onWednesday that the ministry is ``in a period of transition awayfrom the celebrity preacher.''   ``We will be seen by the audience as somewhat different,something fresh, as a ministry that they can have confidence in,''he said.   Also Wednesday, Benton told the court that the ministry wasconsidering selling some of the 1,600 to 1,700 acres of unused landit owns around its Heritage USA Christian retreat.   ``We want to talk to Realtors about how we can best market'' theland, Benton told Reynolds. ``We'll have to develop a plan foryou.''   Reynolds, though, cautioned PTL officials against sellingdevelopable land with a high money-making potential.   Reynolds said Heritage USA could become self-sufficient apartfrom income generated by the PTL television ministry.   ``Are you going to abandon the Christian city?'' the judge asked.   ``We're still interested in having a Christian city, a Christianretreat,'' Benton said.   But Benton said afterwards the ministry is trying to decidewhether it wants to continue in the business of building homes.   Clark now oversees the ministry begun by the Bakkers, whoresigned last year in the middle of a sex scandal that continues tohave repercussions in the world of televangelism.</TEXT></DOC>
