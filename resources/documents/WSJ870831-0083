Triton shares climbed $4 Friday, closing at $23.75, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Based on the closing price, Triton's indicated acquisition value is about $353.9 million. The company has about 14.9 million shares outstanding.    Triton said that Brierley Investments Ltd., Mr. Brierley's Wellington, New Zealand, flagship company, notified the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice that it intends to acquire more than $15 million in Triton stock. The oil and gas concern said it didn't know whether Brierley would buy additional shares, or if it did, how much stock it would buy.    The notification was required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act, which requires Brierley Investments to wait until Sept. 19 to purchase any more Triton stock. The act is designed to allow federal regulators to review proposed mergers and acquisitions for possible antitrust problems. It requires companies and individuals to report holdings of $15 million or more in a company to the FTC and to await an antitrust review before buying any more shares. The review generally takes 15 to 30 days.    Triton declined to comment on the filing. Officials of a Brierley affiliate in La Jolla, Calif., didn't return calls.    If Mr. Brierley does want to buy all of Triton, he may find a willing management, particularly if the price is right. &quot;Triton has been publicly on the record that it's not an entrenched management,&quot; said one analyst who asked not to be identified. But, the analyst conceded, it's too early to determine Mr. Brierley's intentions.    Brierley, the largest listed company in New Zealand, may be attracted by Triton's 47% stake in Crusader Oil, the large Australian oil and gas concern. Through its ownership of Crusader, Triton controls about 15.2 million equivalent barrels of oil, which represents about 19% of Triton's world-wide oil holdings.    Mr. Brierley has a reputation for his ability to see value in overlooked companies. His Brierley Investments has total assets of about $5.6 billion with interests in many companies, including breweries, newspapers and building products. He is also chairman of Industrial Equity Ltd., Sydney, Australia, and Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., Hong Kong.    &quot;He's a real traditional value buyer,&quot; said Hugh Webb-Ware, president of A.C. Goode andamp; Co., New York, a unit of National Australia Bank Ltd. &quot;He doesn't usually pay silly prices for things.&quot;    But Mr. Brierley may only be interested in acquiring Triton stock for investment purposes. Brierley Investments holds interests of less than 50% in about 90 companies world-wide and about 12 in the U.S., according to Brierley's 1986 annual report.    According to Brierley's annual report, which was mailed to Triton with the notification letter, the company's &quot;fundamental investment method is to avoid involvement in the day-to-day management of operations but actively participates in the direction of companies.&quot;    In the U.S., Brierley owns Higbee Co., a Cleveland retailer, and holds interests in Central Pacific Corp., a Bakersfield, Calif., bank holding company, and Anadite Inc., a foundry and forgings company based in Chicago. The company is attempting to acquire all of Anadite, the annual report said.    An unrelated Australian investment concern, Industrial Engineering Ltd., holds 6.8%, or 991,000 shares, of Triton common stock. The company has indicated it holds the stock only as an investment. </TEXT></DOC>
