The margin of the lesions, pleural retraction, involved bronchi,involved vessels, cavity formations and other abnormalities were as clearlyvisualized by CR tomography as by xerotomography. The thickness of thethird or fourth order bronchi could also be observed on the CR tomogram.The CR tomogram proved to be of as much value as the xerotomogram forthe diagnostic delineation of the features of peripheral-type lung lesions.</TEXT></DOC>
