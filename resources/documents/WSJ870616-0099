The action is consistent with recent negotiations among U.S., British and Japanese regulators to improve the capital ratios of financial institutions to guard against foreign-loan exposure and other factors. The decision was reached at a meeting of Japanese government and banking officials last week.    The six banks are Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., Sanwa Bank Ltd., Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., Mitsubishi Trust andamp; Banking Corp., Sumitomo Bank Ltd. and Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.    A spokesman for Industrial Bank of Japan said the bank will issue slightly more than 136 million shares in July, with payment scheduled for Sept. 30. The move will increase the bank's capital by 217.7 billion yen ($1.51 billion) and boost its capital ratio to 3.7% from the current 3%.    The other banks are still deciding on their capital increases. Banking sources said the issues will boost the overall capital ratio of the six banks to 3.5% from 3%.    Separately, the Bank of Japan is asking commercial banks to be more cautious in lending during the July-September quarter. Central bank officials are concerned about the possible inflationary effect of the recent strong pace of money-supply growth. </TEXT></DOC>
