The Communications Workers of America did not release abreakdown of the vote authorizing its executive council to call astrike, with the date to be determined by union President MortonBahr. CWA represents about 130,000 American Telephone and TelegraphCo. employees.   ``At this stage, ATandamp;T has yet to seriously address issues ofconcern to our members, particularly the issue of employmentsecurity,'' Bahr said in announcing results of the secret-ballotauthorization vote.   The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, whichrepresents about 40,000 ATandamp;T employees, is negotiating jointly withCWA and is conducting a strike authorization vote.   ``We're united with CWA,'' IBEW President John Barry said in astatement released with the CWA results. ``Together our members aredetermined to win jobs with justice and a contract worthy of theskills and productivity of our members.''   An ATandamp;T spokesman said the CWA vote was not surprising andexpressed hope a strike could be averted.   ``It is routine for the rank-and-file union members to give theleadership such authorization,'' spokesman Herb Linnen said. ``Itdoesn't mean there will be a strike. We look forward to a hardweek, a challenging week of bargaining and are still optimisticthat a settlement can be reached with the unions without a workstoppage.''   The negotiations began in late March but have stalled over acompany proposal to shift more health care costs to employees. Thetwo sides also have significant differences on pay, according tounion officials.   The company was expected to make its formal contract offer tothe unions early this week. The current contracts expire at 11:59p.m. EDT Saturday.   CWA officials have given mixed signals about whether a strikewould be called immediately if the deadline passed without a newcontract agreement. If the unions and company appear close to anagreement the unions likely would extend the deadline by a day ortwo.   Even if the two sides remain substantially short of a newcontract, many union leaders believe the unions will notimmediately strike but instead will implement a plan for anationwide labor boycott of ATandamp;T long-distance service, a move theysay will cost the company upwards of $10 million a month.   Under this scenario, union leaders say they would at first relyon the boycott to pressure ATandamp;T into concessions and if nosignificant progress was made they then could catch ATandamp;T off guardwith a strike.   Indeed, a CWA statement today stressed that a strike ``is onlyone of several tactics to achieve a fair contract.''   The boycott plan calls for labor unions and relatedorganizations, which predominantly are ATandamp;T customers, totemporarily switch their long distance calls to non-union US Sprintby using Sprint's local access number. The unions and the AFL-CIOalso have pledged to urge their major vendors to boycott ATandamp;T.   This year is the first time CWA and IBEW have negotiatedjointly. Three years ago CWA struck ATandamp;T for 26 days, but thecompany was able to keep half of its manufacturing plants openbecause the IBEW agreed to work provided its members were given anyadded benefits CWA won through its strike.   That bitter experience, which came in the first contract talksafter the ATandamp;T breakup, led to the agreement to negotiate jointlythis year. Bahr and Barry have promised that their unions willstick together in the event of a strike.</TEXT></DOC>
