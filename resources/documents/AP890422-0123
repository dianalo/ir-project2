Congressman Carlos Tablante, whose accusations brought about theinvestigation, has said the case involves overbilling and grantsfor dollars for non-existent imports that could amount to more than$4 billion.   The alleged fraud occurred during the administration ofPresident Jaime Lusinchi of the Social Democratic Party, when therewas a preferential dollar exchange system.   That system was abolished shortly after the Feb. 2 inaugurationof President Carlos Andres Perez, also a Social Democrat, whosucceeded Lusinchi.   The preferential plan pegged the exchange at 14.50 bolivars perdollar for some imports and foreign debt payments. When it waseliminated, it left only the free market rate that ranged around 36bolivars per dollar last month.   Judge Luis La Riva's order issued Friday banned ex-financeministers Manuel Azpurua and Hector Hurtado from leaving Venezuela.Also named in the prohibition order were former vice financeminister Jorge Garcia Duque; Egdalia Bastardo, who had been thedirector of Recadi, and an unspecified number of other people whothe judge did not identify.   Recadi was the government agency, since abolished, that for sixyears was in charge of granting the preferential exchange forimports. Investigations by both La Riva and a congressionalcommittee are centered on Recadi.   Azpurua was finance minister during the first three years ofLusinchi's five-year administration. He was replaced by Hurtado,who had previously served as minister of development.</TEXT></DOC>
