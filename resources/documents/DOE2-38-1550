In these events the sum of the kineticenergies of fragments and the total energies of produced paricles, T/submeas/={Sigma}(T/sub i/)/sub fr/+{Sigma}(T/sub i/+m/sub {pi}/), exceedsthe kinetic energy of the projectile (T/sub 0/). Assuming maximum andminimum errors of {Delta}T/sub meas/, the limits of veriation of T/submeas/-T/sub 0/ have been found in the events with T/sub meas/andgt; T/sub0/. Using the statistical methods of identification of fast positiveparticle, T/sub meas/ andgt; T/sub 0/=(0.19-0.51) GeV with a statistical errorof 0.09 GeV for the events of P/sub 0/=4.2 GeV/c, and it is equal to(0.59-1.33)+-0.21 GeV for P/sub 0/=10 GeV/c. This corresponds to thenumber of events with T/sub meas/ andgt; T/sub 0/ from 3 to 9%. In the groupof events with T/sub meas/ andgt; T/sub 0/ a (2-3) fold increase of energyrelease for {pi}/sup -/-mesons has been observed as compared to the eventswithout selection. The conclusion can be drawn that the evens with T/submeas/ andgt; T/sub 0/ cannot be completely interpreted as a consequence ofmethodic errors. 11 refs.; 4 figs.; 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
