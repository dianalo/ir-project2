Lawmakers urged changesin the law to reduce royal privileges.   There were no votes against putting the king back on the throne,but 93 of the 338 deputies present abstained.   King Baudouin, a devout Catholic, refused to sign the abortionbill after it was passed by Parliament last Friday. As theconstitutional head of state, he must sign all bills to make themlaw.   On Tuesday, Baudouin agreed to a temporary suspension. He wasremoved from the throne Wednesday, after which the governmentenacted the law itself.   Prime Minister Wilfried Martens said his center-left governmentwill seek changes in the constitution to prevent future refusals bythe king, on moral grounds, to endorse legislation. He did notelaborate.   But it is expected the government wants the royal powers,already largely ceremonial, reduced further.   Experts said the king cannot cast aside his constitutional roleonly because he morally opposes legislation. They said he can onlylose his constitutional powers if he is physically or mentallyunable to rule.   The bill the king opposes ended a 123-year ban on abortions inthis overwhelmingly Catholic nation. It allows abortions if awoman's doctor deems a patient is in ``a state of distress.''Opponents say this in fact makes abortion available on demand.   ``In short, the bill represents a serious diminution of respectfor the life of the weakest. You will therefore understand I do notwish to be involved with that law,'' the monarch said in a letterto Martens last week.   ``To those who are surprised at my attitude, I put the followingquestion: Is it normal that I am the only Belgian citizen who mustact against his conscience in such important matters? Do all havethe freedom of conscience except the king?''   The Belgian monarch has long opposed abortion. In his 1989Christmas message, he spoke of the need for ``special protectionand care (for children) including the correct legal protection bothbefore and after birth.''   Vatican Radio on Thursday praised King Baudouin for refusing tosign the bill into law.   In an introduction to a news report, the radio station said theking made a ``noble and courageous choice'' that was dictated byhis ``very strong moral conscience and his undisputible sense ofstatehood.''   The Roman Catholic Church opposes abortion in all circumstances,and Pope John Paul II has campaigned continuously against it. Therehas been no comment from the pope on the king's move.</TEXT></DOC>
