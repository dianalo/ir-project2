About 225 officers brought to the Capitol by the National RifleAssociation from 49 states _ Hawaii was not represented _ held anews conference before fanning out to pitch their views to membersof Congress.   They were here to combat the impact of law enforcement officialssuch as Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates and Baltimore CountyPolice Chief Neil Behan, who are pushing for controls on theassault-style weapons, including semiautomatic versions of theAK-47 and Uzi.   Law enforcement groups that have taken similar stands includethe National Fraternal Order of Police, the InternationalAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the National Sheriff'sAssociation, the National Association of Police Organizations andthe Police Executive Research Forum.   ``Often you, as news media, hear from the chiefs, the appointedofficials, and they say they speak for us,'' said Patrolman RayMaples, president of the Memphis Police Association. ``I'm heretelling you this morning for thousands of us out there that thechiefs, the appointed officials, do not speak for the lawenforcement officers that are in the field, in the trenches, doingthe job.''   But Stephen Brown, counsel to the National Fraternal Order ofPolice, said his organization represents 200,000 police officers,not their bosses.   ``The Fraternal Order of Police does speak for the cop on thestreet,'' Brown said. ``There's no chiefs, there's no sheriffs.They don't speak for anyone except for the cops on the beat.''   Attending the news conference to express support for theofficers brought in by the NRA were Reps. Larry E. Craig, R-Idaho,Larkin I. Smith, R-Miss., Harold L. Volkmer, D-Mo., and RonMarlenee, R-Mont., as well as Sen. James A. McClure, R-Idaho.   Lt. Harry Thomas of the Cincinnati Police Department noted thatmany of the officers attending were ``under direct orders fromtheir police chiefs to disassociate themselves from theirrespective police departments.''   ``Some of us are here with our chiefs' blessings, and some ofour chiefs are hoping our planes go down on the way home,'' Thomassaid. ``The remarks that are made here should not be construed asthe official policy of our respective police departments.''   Officer Leroy Pyle of the San Jose Police Department inCalifornia said it ``offends me'' that some law enforcement leaderssay police are being ``outgunned'' by criminals with assault-styleweapons.   ``Some of those administrators who are saying that arerepeatedly saying that policemen are afraid, that the policemen areoutgunned, that we're losing. ...We didn't come to this job tolose, and we don't want anybody saying we're losers,'' he said.   ``We go out there. We use education, training, tactics and goodcommon sense. And we win,'' he said.   The officers said they feared moves to limit access to theweapons was just the first step toward disarmament of thepopulation. Thomas noted that in Beijing unarmed demonstrators weregunned down by army troops.</TEXT></DOC>
