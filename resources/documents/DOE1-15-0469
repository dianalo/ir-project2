<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-15-0469 </DOCNO><TEXT>An 'oil calorific value unit' was developed, which consists of speciallytuned boiler, burner and controls and which is designed for detachedand semi-detached houses. The latent heat of the combustion gases isused. The basis of using the calorific value (waste gas and condensationheat of the steam) and the work done are explained. This includes investigationof materials (surface coating, properties), the development of a modularoil evaporation burner (smooth regulation, soot-free blue flame with14% CO content), basic examination of a measuring combustion chamber(determining thermal data, 8 successive annular hollow spaces), designwork on a cast iron monobloc boiler (leak-tightness, condensate path,efficiency, compact construction, small amount of machining and installationwork) and field experiments (computer-aided measurements).
