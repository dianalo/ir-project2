At the seven-nation economic summit, which begins Sunday inToronto, President Reagan will again propose an elimination of whathe calls the farms race, the $150 billion industrial countries arespending every year to subsidize agricultural products.   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III said today in a broadcastinterview with foreign journalists that the farm subsidy issuewould receive a ``full-fledged'' discussion at the three-day summit.   Baker said the United States hoped to receive a commitment fromthe other countries to move forward with negotiations begun twoyears ago as part of worldwide trade liberalization talks. He saidthis would be similar to a pledge made last month by 24 industrialcountries at a Paris meeting.   However, that statement was seen as a major defeat for theUnited States delegation, led by Baker, because America hadoriginally wanted much tougher language committing the countries toworking for a specific date for the scrapping of subsidies.   But Baker today disputed the contention that no progress hadbeen made in Paris.   ``The fact that we are even discussing this very difficultproblem of agricultural subsidies represents progress,'' he said inan interview made available to overseas broadcasters by the U.S.Information Agency.   ``It is not going to be at all easy to move toward eliminatingsubsidies or reducing subsidies for any of us unless we are allable to go to our farmers and say the world is going to do this,''he said.   The United States is hoping to keep the pressure on so that hardbargaining to end protectionism in agriculture can take place at aMontreal trade meeting in December.   The Montreal meeting will be a midterm review for the currentround of global trade talks which were launched in 1986 in Uruguayand scheduled to end in 1990.   The United States wants trade negotiators to prepare a detailedoutline at the Montreal meeting of what they intend to accomplishbetween this year and the scheduled end of the Uruguay Round oftrade talks two years from now. The United States wants the outlineto state as a goal the phase out of subsidies by a date certain,probably the year 2000.   While this will be the U.S. stand in Toronto, it is likely thatthe leaders will instead adopt a less ambitious statement similarto one adopted last month at a Paris meeting of the Organizationfor Economic Cooperation in which the summit countries pledged towork for reduction of the subsidies rather than totally scrappingthem.   All countries agree in principal that farm subsidies are a majordrain on their treasuries, but Europeans claim that politicalpressures make it impossible to totally eliminate farm supportprograms.   Instead, they are arguing for an effort to reduce the subsidiesto a less costly level, perhaps one-half of where supports arecurrently.   ``President Reagan isn't going to be there to implement theelimination of the subsidies, so he can hang tough. But otherforeign leaders, who may want to run for re-election again, see hisapproach as far too radical,'' said Robert Z. Lawrence, aneconomist at the Brookings Institution, a Washington researchorganization.   The battle over food subsidies has been a highly contentioustrade issue for several years as countries have waged costlybattles to support their own farmers.   The food glut has occurred in part because of various advancesin developing new and improved crop strains which occurred as manycountries decided in the past two decades that they wanted to beself-sufficient in farm production.   Western Europe, the world's largest food importer in 1970, isnow second to the United States in the amount of food it exports.   The United States is still the world's largest exporter of farmcommodities, accounting for roughly 40 percent of the volume ofwheat and feed grains sold on world markets. But since reaching arecord of $41.7 billion in 1981, U.S. farm exports steadilydeclined for five years, falling to a low of $26.6 billion in 1986.They posted a slight increase to $29 billion in 1987.   With the drop in U.S. agricultural sales abroad has come a risein foreign farm shipments to this country. The traditional tradesurplus America runs in farm products has shrunk from $26.6 billionin 1981 to just $6.5 billion last year.   The Reagan administration's push to reduce farm subsidiesthrough trade negotiations has generated very little reaction amongfarm lobbying groups in this country.   A recent review of the situation by the General AccountingOffice said that many farm groups believe the U.S. proposal is agood negotiating strategy but believe it is highly unrealistic tothink that countries would totally dismantle their domestic supportprograms.   But the issue is unlikely to go away because of the cost of theprograms in government spending and higher food prices to consumers.</TEXT></DOC>
