It is disposed faced to it and comprises a wire electrode and      a shield enclosing the wire electrode. Corona discharging device is an      effective means to uniformly charge the member to be charged up to a      predetermined potential However, it is disadvantageous in that it requires      a high voltage source and a relatively large amount of ozone is produced      by corona discharging action. </PAR><PAR>  In place of the corona discharging device, a contactable type charging      device is proposed. It comprises a charging member supplied with a voltage      and contacted to the member to be charged so as to charge it. It is      advantageous in that the required voltage is low and that the amount of      produced ozone is very small. It is noted as means in place of the corona      discharging apparatus for the purpose of charging the photosensitive      member, the dielectric member or another image bearing member or another      member to be charged in an image forming apparatus (Japanese Laid-Open      Patent Applications Nos. 178267/1979, 104351/1981, 40566/1983, 139156/1983      and 10975/1983). </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,851,960 which has been assigned to the assignee of this      application proposes a contact type charging method and apparatus in which      a vibratory voltage (a voltage level periodically changes) having a      peak-to-peak voltage which is not less than twice the charge starting      voltage relative to the member to be charged, is applied to the charging      member to provide uniform charge. </PAR><PAR>  As for the charging member, it is conventionally in the form of a roller or      a blade. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 shows an example of an image bearing member using a contact type      chargeable member in the form of a roller to charge the image bearing      member. The image forming apparatus is an image transfer type      electrophotographic apparatus (copying machine, a laser beam printer or      the like). </PAR><PAR>  It comprises an electrophotographic photosensitive member (rigid member)      which will hereinafter be called &quot;photosensitive drum&quot;, in the form of a      drum. It is driven in the clockwise direction at a predetermined      peripheral speed (process speed). </PAR><PAR>  A charging roller 2 comprises a conductive core metal 2a made of iron,      stainless steel (SUS) or the like and a conductive rubber layer 2b made of      EPDM or the like containing carbon and covering the outer periphery      thereof. The roller 2 is contacted to the surface of the photosensitive      drum 1 by urging the core metal 2a adjacent the opposite longitudinal ends      thereof by an urging means not shown such as spring, and it rotates      following the rotation of the photosensitive drum 1 in this example. </PAR><PAR>  An external voltage source 9 supplies voltage to the charging roller 2. It      applies to the charging roller 2 a vibratory voltage provided by a      predetermined DC voltage superposed with an AC voltage having a      peak-to-peak voltage which is not less than twice the charge starting      voltage relative to the photosensitive member, through a contact spring 8      and a core metal 2a . The outer periphery of the photosensitive drum 1      rotated is charged to a predetermined potential. </PAR><PAR>  Then, the charged photosensitive member is exposed to image light by      charging means 3. The image light is image light of an original or a      scanning laser beam imagewisely modulated, so that an electrostatic latent      image is sequentially formed on the photosensitive member in accordance      with the intended image information. </PAR><PAR>  Subsequently, a developing device supplied toner to the surface of the      photosensitive drum 1 from a developing sleeve 4 to develop the latent      image into a toner image on the photosensitive drum 1. </PAR><PAR>  An image transfer roller 5 is press-contacted to the photosensitive drum 1      at a position downstream of the developing sleeve 4 in the rotational      direction of the photosensitive drum. A transfer material 7 is fed from an      unshown sheet feeder to a nip (transfer position) between the      photosensitive drum 1 and the transfer roller 5. It is supplied at such a      timing that when the leading edge of the toner image on the photosensitive      drum 1 reaches the nip, a leading edge of the transfer material 7 reaches      the nip. To the transfer roller 5 a transfer bias is applied from voltage      source, so that the toner image is transferred from the photosensitive      drum 1 surface to the transfer material 7 gradually in the process of the      transfer material 7 passing through the nip. </PAR><PAR>  The surface of the photosensitive drum 1 after the toner image transfer is      cleaned by a cleaning device 6 so that the residual toner or the like is      removed, and therefore, is prepared for the repeated image formation. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 shows another example of the charging member 20 in the form of a      blade rather than the charging roller 2 (FIG. 10) It comprises a      conductive core 20a and a conductive rubber blade 20b. The charging blade      20 is contacted to the surface of the photosensitive drum 1      co-directionally or counter-directionally. A voltage is applied to the      core plate 20a to charge the photosensitive drum 1 surface. </PAR><PAR>  The system using the charging roller or the charging blade involves the      following problems. </PAR><PAR>  (1) Where the surface of the charging member is rubber directly contacted      to the photosensitive drum (image bearing member), and when the charging      roller or the blade is press-contacted to the photosensitive drum for a      long period of time, the plasticizer of the rubber oozes out from the      rubber layer and is deposited on the photosensitive drum surface with the      result of flowing image. </PAR><PAR>  (2) The size of the transfer material is large as in the case of A3 size,      the length of the charging roller becomes large. When the charging roller      is urged to the photosensitive drum by pressing means at the opposite      ends, the central portion thereof may be out of contact from the surface      of the photosensitive drum, with the result of improper charging. </PAR><PAR>  (3) With the increase of the process speed, the frequency of the primary      voltage source supplied to the charging roller or the blade is required to      be increased in order to prevent non-uniform charging. If the frequency is      increased, the vibration of the photosensitive drum, charging roller or      the blade is produced with the result of larger noise. </PAR><PAR>  (4) In an image forming apparatus which is recently required to be reduced      in the size, the size of the photosensitive drum and the size of the      charging means are desired to be further reduced. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Accordingly, it is a principal object of the present invention to provide      an image forming apparatus wherein the possible production of flow of      image attributable to the foreign matter oozed from the charging means and      deposited on the image bearing member, is prevented. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of the present invention to provide an image forming      apparatus wherein the improper charging is prevented by improving contact      between the image bearing member and the charging means. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object of the present invention to provide an image forming      apparatus wherein charging noise is reduced. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object of the present invention to provide an image forming      apparatus having a small size and low cost charging means. </PAR><PAR>  These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention      will become more apparent upon a consideration of the following      description of the preferred embodiments of the present invention taken in      conjunction with the accompanying drawings. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a side view of a charging device usable with an image forming      apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a top plan view of the charging device of FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the charging device of FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 4, 6, 14, 16, 17, 25, 26, 27, 29A and 29B are side views of charging      devices according to other embodiments. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5A is a top plan view of the charging device of FIG. 4. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5B is a perspective view of the charging device of FIG. 4. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a top plan view of the charging device of FIG. 6. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a perspective view of the charging device of FIG. 6. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 9A, 9B, 9C, 9D, 9E, 9F, 9G, 9H, 9I and 9K are sectional views of the      charging wire.

In this Figure, the same      reference numerals as in FIG. 10 are assigned to the elements having the      corresponding functions, and the detailed description therefor is omitted. </PAR><PAR>  The photosensitive drum 1 (image bearing member), charging means 10, 11 and      12 for the photosensitive drum 1, the cleaning device and the developing      device are supported on a frame P (hatched portion) of a process unit. The      frame of the process unit P is detachably mountable to a main assembly of      the image forming apparatus along a guide G in a direction perpendicular      to the sheet of the drawing. The process unit P may contain at least one      of the photosensitive drum 1 and the charging device 10, 11 or 12. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows an enlarged view of the charging device used in the image      forming apparatus of FIG. 12. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 1, FIGS. 2 and 3, the description will be made as to a      contactable wire type charging device. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 2 and 3 are top plan view and a perspective view of the charging      device of FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  A photosensitive drum 1 is a member to be charged and comprises a drum base      1b of aluminum and a photosensitive layer 1a thereon made of organic      photoconductive (OPC) in this embodiment. It has an outer diameter of 30      mm in this embodiment. It is rotated in the clockwise direction at a      predetermined speed. </PAR><PAR>  A charging wire 10 functions as a contact type charging member and is made      of conductive wire of iron, copper, aluminum, stainless steel or the like.      Urging members 11 and 11 adjacent the opposite longitudinal ends thereof      press-contact the charging wire to the photosensitive drum 1 surface. The      charging wire is made of polyacetal (DERLIN, available from DuPont) and      extends parallel with a generating line of the drum. The charging wire 10      is made of tungsten plated with gold and has an outer diameter of 60      microns in this embodiment. </PAR><PAR>  Springs ,12 and 12 normally urge the urging members 11 and 11 toward the      photosensitive drum 1. The charging wire between the urging members 11 and      11 extends in a direction crossing with the movement direction of the      photosensitive drum 1, and press-contacted to the surface of the      photosensitive drum 1 covering an effective charging width of the      photosensitive drum 1. </PAR><PAR>  To the charging wire 10, a voltage is applied from the voltage source 9      through a contact 8, by which a vibratory voltage in the form of a DC      biased AC voltage is applied thereto so that a charging electric field is      formed between the wire 10 and the drum 1, so that a voltage having a      periodically changing voltage level is applied. Preferably, the vibratory      voltage has a peak-to-peak voltage which is not less than twice a charge      starting voltage between the wire 10 and the photosensitive member 1.      Then, between the wire 10 and the drum 1, a vibratory voltage is      sufficient to effect transfer and transfer-back of the electric charge.      The waveform of the vibratory voltage may be sine rectangular, triangular      or pulse-like. The charging is possible using the DC voltage only. </PAR><PAR>  With this structure, the photosensitive drum is rotated at a peripheral      speed of 40 mm/sec, and the charging wire 10 is supplied with a DC voltage      component of -700 V and with an AC voltage component having a peak-to-peak      voltage of 1800 Vpp and a frequency of 250 Hz, from the voltage source 9.      It has been confirmed that the surface of the photosensitive member 1a is      uniformly charged approximately to -700 V, and good image is produced. </PAR><PAR>  As described hereinbefore, it is desirable that the peak-to-peak voltage of      the AC component or the vibratory voltage is not less than twice the      charge starting voltage which is the voltage at which the charging of the      member to be charged starts when only a DC voltage is applied to the      charging member, since then the member is uniformly charged. In this      embodiment, the charge starting voltage with the DC voltage only was -500      V, and therefore, the peak-to-peak voltage providing the uniformity was      approximately 1100 Vpp. </PAR><PAR>  It has been confirmed that there is no flow of the image attributable to      the plasticizer oozed from the conductive rubber in the case of the      conventional charging roller or the charging blade, the local improper      charging by the non-contact between the charging member and the      photosensitive member, or significant charging noise. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIGS. 6, 7 and 8, a charging device according to another      embodiment of the present invention will be described. FIGS. 7 and 8 are a      top plan view and a perspective view of the charging device of FIG. 6. In      this embodiment, two charging wires are used. The two charging wires 10A      and 10B are extended parallel with each other and are press-contacted to      the surface of the photosensitive drum 1 by urging members 11 and 11. They      are supplied with voltages. Even if foreign matter is deposited on one of      the charging wires, or even if one of them is broken, the charging      operation can be kept by the remaining charging wire. The number may be      three or more. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, a charging device according to a further      embodiment of the present invention will be described, in which the      non-contact between the charging wire and the photosensitive drum is      prevented. FIG. 4 is a side view of the charging device, and FIG. 5 is a      partly broken-away top plan view. In this embodiment, the charging wire 10      is urged to the photosensitive drum surface 1 by an elastic member 14      which is made of MOLTOPREN (AVAILABLE from INOAC Kabushiki Kaisha, Japan)      or the like and which is long enough to cover the entire length of the      wire 10, by which the urged state is maintained over the entire length of      the charging wire. The elastic member 14 has an elongated rigid holder      plate 13 at a side opposite from the side of the wire urged to the      photosensitive member. The holder plate 13 is made of DERLIN or the like.      The holder plate 13 is urged by an unshown pressing member toward the      photosensitive drum 1 with the elastic member 14 sandwiched between the      holder plate 13 and the surface of the photosensitive drum 1 against the      elastic force thereof, by which the entire length of the charging wire 10      is stably and uniformly pressed to the photosensitive drum 1, thus      establishing the cross contact therebetween. Therefore, even if the      charging wire 10 is supplied from the external voltage source 9 with the      vibratory voltage having a large peak-to-peak voltage, the vibration of      the charging wire 10 is not significant, as contacted to the case of FIGS.      1-3. </PAR><PAR>  Even if a DC voltage only is supplied to the charging wire, the charging      wire 10 does not dance upon the application thereof. As a result, the      charging wire 10 is maintained in contact with the photosensitive drum 1      surface, so that the stabilized charging is possible. When the unevenness      of the photosensitive drum surface 1 is large, this is particularly      effective. In addition, as contrasted to the conventional charging blade,      the silica particles and toner particles passed under the cleaning blade 6      are collected by the elastic members 14, and therefore, the charging wire      10 is not contaminated. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 13, two or more charging wires 10 may be used, similarly      to the cases of FIGS. 6, 7 and 8. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 14 and 15 show a further embodiment of the charging device. In this      embodiment, the charging wire 10 is made parallel to the generating line      of the drum, and the opposite ends thereof are confined by urging members      11a and 11a made or DERLIN or the like. The portion of the charging wire      between the confining members 11a and 11a is contacted to the surface of      the photosensitive drum 1 by a resilient force of an urging sheet 11b      which is made of polyethylene terephthalate (Myler (trade name)) having a      thickness of 100 microns, and which is fixed on a cleaning blade holder 6a      at one of its long sides. </PAR><PAR>  With this structure, the charging operation is stabilized, and the urging      member 11b is not directly contacted to the photosensitive drum 1, and      therefore, the photosensitive drum is not scraped by the urging member.      Other materials of the urging member 11b include stainless steel,      aluminum, PET, copper sheet or the like. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 16 shows a further embodiment of the charging device. In this      embodiment, the cleaning blade 6 is used as the urging member for the      charging wire 10. </PAR><PAR>  A backside of the cleaning blade 6 is provided with a positioning groove 6b      for accommodating the charging wire 10. The groove 6b extends in the      longitudinal direction of the blade 6, that is, in the direction of the      generating line of the photosensitive drum. The charging wire 10 is in the      groove 6b and is bonded by a bonding agent if necessary. The edge of the      cleaning blade 6 is press-contacted to the photosensitive drum 1 surface,      and the charging wire 10 at the backside of the blade 6 is urged to the      surface of the photosensitive drum 1. With this state, the cleaning blade      is fixedly mounted on an unshown mounting member. With this structure, no      additional member is required to urge the charging wire 10, and the      structure around the photosensitive drum is very simple. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 17-19 show a further embodiment of the charging device. The charging      wire 10 functioning as the contactable charging member has a core metal      10c made of tungsten and having a diameter of 60 microns and a coating of      N-methoxymethyl nylon (Tresin, available from Teikoku Kagaku Sangyo      Kabushiki Kaisha) having a thickness of 10 microns as a resin surface      layer 10d. The core metal 10c may be of a conductive wire made of iron,      copper, aluminum, stainless steel or the like. </PAR><PAR>  In order to enhance the bonding strength between the surface layer 10d and      the metal core 10c, one or more primer layer may be used. The volume      resistivity of the primer layer or layers are not required to be smaller      than that of the surface layer 10d, but the film thickness may be selected      within such a range that the contact type charging wire 10 is capable of      charging the photosensitive drum 1. </PAR><PAR>  The resin coated charging wire 10 is produced in the following manner.      First, n-methoxymethyl nylon is solved in a solvent such as a mixture of      methanol and toluene to produce n-methoxymethyl nylon resin liquid. The      liquid 100d is contained in a container 200 as shown in FIG. 20. The core      metal 10c of tungsten wire is repeatedly dipped thereinto to form the      resin layer 10d on the surface of the tungsten wire. The moving speed and      the drying period of the tungsten wire 10c are so determined that the      thickness of the resin layer 10d is 1-1000 microns. Designated by a      reference numeral 300 is a drier. </PAR><PAR>  The charging wire 10 thus produced is extended substantially in parallel      with the drum generating line in contact with the surface of the      photosensitive drum 1 by the urging members 11 and 11 made of DERLIN or      the like. The urging member 11 and 11 are urged by the springs 12 to      normally urge the wire to the drum. The charging wire 10 between the      urging members 11 and 11 is press-contacted to the surface of the      photosensitive drum 1. </PAR><PAR>  To the core metal 10c of the charging wire 10, a vibratory voltage which is      an AC biased DC voltage is supplied from the voltage source through the      contact 8. By the application of the vibratory voltage, the voltage level      applied to the charging wire 10 periodically changes. More particularly,      the peak-to-peak voltage of the vibratory voltage is not less than twice      the charge starting voltage relative to the photosensitive member. The      vibratory voltage has a sine, rectangular, triangular and pulse waveform.      The member to be charged can be charged by the DC voltage only. </PAR><PAR>  Since the core metal 10c of the charging wire 10 is made of tungsten, the      electric resistance is substantially 0 ohm, and the electric resistance of      the surface layer 10d is approximately 30M-ohm, and the electrostatic      capacity thereof is approximately 1700 pF. Therefore, the reactance      (capacitance)andequals;1/2.pi.fC is approximately 0.4M-ohm when the core metal 10c      is supplied with an DC bias voltage of 250 Hz. Since the resistance of the      core metal 10c of the charging wire 10 is negligibly small as compared      with the resistance of the surface layer 10d, the resistance of the      charging wire 10 is substantially equal to the resistance of the surface      layer 10d. </PAR><PAR>  The resistance and the electrostatic capacitance of the charging wire 10 is      determined in the following manner. The charging wire is pressed to the      drum made of aluminum, and a resistance measuring device and an      electrostatic capacitance measuring device are connected between the core      metal 10c and the aluminum drum. The obtained values are converted to the      values per 1 cm.sup.2. The electrostatic capacitance per 1 cm.sup.2 of the      photosensitive drum (the member to be charged) is approximately 140 pF. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 24 shows an equivalent circuit of the charging device. Since, </PAR><EQU>  Randgt;1/2.pi.fC, </EQU><EQU>  Candgt;Cd </EQU><PAL>  The AC voltage VAC can be applied to the photosensitive drum substantially      without loss, </PAL><PAR>  where R is a resistance of the charging wire; f is a frequency of the      applied bias voltage; c is an electrostatic capacitance of the charging      wire; and Cd is the electrostatic capacitance of the photosensitive drum. </PAR><PAR>  In the above inequations, the difference by one order is sufficient. Since      the resistance R of the surface layer 10d of the charging wire is      sufficiently large, a pin hole of the photosensitive drum if any does not      result in leakage of the current between the charging wire and the pin      hole. Therefore, the voltage drop of the power supply system can be      prevented. </PAR><PAR>  The resistance R of the charging wire 10 is </PAR><EQU>  8.51.times.10.sup.2 ohm.ltoreq.R.ltoreq.2.20.times.10.sup.12 ohm. </EQU><PAR>  The former part of the inequation is the requirement for the prevention of      the leakage and the latter part thereof is the requirement for the      prevention of improper charging. </PAR><PAR>  The electrostatic capacitance C of the charging wire 10 is </PAR><EQU>  1 pF.ltoreq.C.ltoreq.100 nF. </EQU><PAR>  The electrostatic capacitance Cd of the photosensitive drum 1 (the member      to be charged) </PAR><EQU>  0.1 pF.ltoreq.Cd.ltoreq.10 nF. </EQU><PAR>  Using the above-described structure, the photosensitive drum 1 was rotated      at a peripheral speed of 40 mm/sec. To the core metal 10c of the charging      wire 10, a vibratory voltage having a DC component of -700 V and an AC      component having a peak-to-peak voltage of 1800 Vpp and a frequency of 250      Hz, was applied from the power source 9. Then, the surface of the      photosensitive member 1A was uniformly charged to approximately -700 V.      Good images were produced without problem attributable to the pin hole. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention is particularly advantageous when the peak-to-peak      voltage of the AC component is not less than twice the charging starting      voltage which is the voltage at which the charging of the member to be      charged starts upon application only of the DC voltage, since then the      charging becomes uniform. In this embodiment, the charge starting voltage      was -560 V when the DC voltage only was applied. </PAR><PAR>  Here, it is assumed that the resistance of the charging wire 10 with the      surface layer 10b relative t the photosensitive drum 1 is R1, the volume      resistivity of the core metal 10a is .pi.1, the volume resistivity of the      surface layer 10b is .pi.2, the radius of the core metal 10a is r1, the      radius of the contact charging wire 10 is r2, the (effective) length of      the charging wire 10 is L, and the nip width is d(andequals;2.times.r2). </PAR><PAR>  Since the core metal 10a of the charging wire 10 is made of iron., the      volume resistivity P1 is </PAR><EQU>  9.41.times.10.sup.-8 ohm.cm </EQU><PAL>  and therefore, it is substantially zero. Therefore, </PAL><EQU>  R1andequals;(.pi.2.times.lnr2/r1)/Ld </EQU><PAL>  The volume resistivity .pi.2 has been confirmed to be preferably 10.sup.5      ohm.cm-10.sup.12 ohm.cm in order to provide good charging operation. </PAL><PAR>  As described in the foregoing, according to this embodiment, at least the      contact portion of the conductive base of the contactable charging wire      with the member to be charged is coated with at least one resistance      layer, and the volume resistivity of the outermost layer of the charging      member is made larger than the volume resistivity of the base of the      charging wire. Therefore, even if the member to be charged has a pin hole,      the voltage drop of the power supply system attributable to the current      leakage can be prevented, and therefore, the improper charging of the      entire range where the charging member is in contact with the member to be      charged, can be prevented. </PAR><PAR>  The contactable charging wire may be a bare metal wire without coating.      However, if, for example, a pin hole is produced in the surface of the      photosensitive drum (the member to be charged) in the image forming      apparatus for some reason or another (shot by foreign matter or      introduction thereof, for example), the current leakage occurs between the      charging wire and the pin hole of the photosensitive drum with the result      of significant voltage drop of the power supply system, when the pin hole      comes to the charging wire. Therefore, if the leakage occurs, the improper      charging occurs in the entire longitudinal range contacting the      photosensitive drum. In the actual image, it becomes a black stripe in the      case of a reverse development, and it becomes a white stripe in the case      of a regular development. The black or white stripe appears repeatedly      with the period of the rotation of the photosensitive drum, and therefore,      the image quality is significantly degraded. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 21 shows this situation. This Figure is a sectional view when the pin      hole h of the photosensitive drum 1 comes right below the bare charging      member 10c without the coating. As will be understood, if the charging      wire 10c is of a bare metal such as iron, the electric current I easily      flows into the pin hole h along the length of the charging wire 10c, in      other words, the large current path is produced toward the pin hole h, and      therefore, the voltage easily drops. </PAR><PAR>  By coating the charging wire in the manner described above, the volume      resistivity of the surface layer of the charging wire is larger than that      of the conductive core, and therefore, the current toward the surface      defect such as pin hole along the surface layer becomes smaller.      Therefore, even if there is the pin hole or other defect, the voltage drop      of the power supply system attributable to the leakage can be prevented.      Therefore, the improper charging does not occur over the entire contact      region between the charging member and the member to be charged. In the      case of the image forming apparatus, the above-described degrading of the      image quality can be avoided. Without increasing the voltage of the supply      system, the sufficient voltage can be supplied, and therefore, the      improper charging or non-uniform charging attributable to the insufficient      AC voltage, can be prevented. The advantageous effects are particularly      significant, when the peak-to-peak voltage of the vibratory voltage is not      less than twice the charge starting voltage which is the voltage at which      the charging of the member to be charged starts when a DC voltage only is      applied. </PAR><PAR>  When the charging member is a bare core metal 10c without the surface layer      10d is directly contacted to the photosensitive drum, and a voltage is      applied to the charging member, the equivalent circuit is as shown in FIG.      24. The resistance r of the core metal 10c is substantially 0 ohm. As      described hereinbefore, if the photosensitive drum 1 has a pin hole, the      voltage leaks with the result of the non-uniform stripe produced along the      length of the photosensitive drum 1. </PAR><PAR>  This embodiment, the charging member has the surface layer of a dielectric      material on the conductive wire, and the reactance of the charging member      relative to the vibratory voltage (AC voltage) is smaller than the      resistance of the charging wire. The charging member has the dielectric      layer or the surface layer comprising a resistance layer and a dielectric      layer at least at a contact portion with the member to be charged, by      which the charging member has the electrostatic capacity component or a      resistance and electrostatic capacity components. The resistance is      sufficiently large so as to prevent the leakage between the charging      member and a pin hole of the member to be charged even if the member to be      charged (photosensitive drum or the like) has a pin hole due to shot by or      introduction of foreign matter. The electrostatic capacity is made      sufficiently larger than that of the member to be charged, by which the      reactance of the charging member relative to the AC voltage is made      sufficiently smaller than the resistance of the charging wire. </PAR><PAR>  As a result, even if the member to be charged as a pin hole, the voltage      drop of the power supply system due to the leakage can be prevented, so      that the improper charging of the entire range along the length of the      charging member where it is contacted to the member to be charged, can be      prevented. </PAR><PAR>  Therefore, in the case of the image forming apparatus, the black stripe      (reverse development) and white stripe (regular development) which is      attributable to the leakage and which appears periodically in accordance      with the rotation of the photosensitive drum, can be prevented. And      therefore, the degradation of the quality of the image thereby can be      prevented. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, without increasing the AC voltage, the sufficient voltage can      be applied to the member to be charged. Therefore, the improper or      non-uniform charging due to the insufficient AC voltage can be prevented.      This advantageous effects are particularly significant when the      peak-to-peak voltage of the vibratory voltage applied to the contact type      charging wire is not less than twice the charge starting voltage which is      the voltage at which the charging of the member to be charged starts when      only the DC voltage is applied. </PAR><PAR>  Since the charging wire does not have the charging layer made of rubber or      the like as in the case of the charging roller or the charging blade,      there is no production of the image flow attributable to the oozed      plasticizer of the conductive rubber layer, local improper charging      attributable to the rising of the charging member, or the charging noise. </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 17-19, the wire 10 may be press-contacted      to the surface of the drum 1 by an elongated elastic member made of      moltprane or the like over the entire length of the charging wire 10, as      described hereinbefore. Two or more charging wires may be disposed in      parallel with each other. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 25, the charging member comprises: </PAR><PAR>  conductive wire 10e having a diameter d of 60 microns and made of tungsten;      and </PAR><PAR>  a resistance member 10f having a volume resistivity of 10.sup.10 ohm.cm      made of fluorinated resin containing carbon (EMLARON (trade name),      available from Nippon Ajison Kabushiki Kaisha) and having a thickness of      25 microns. </PAR><PAR>  In the case of this contactable charging member 10, the charging width L      was 200 microns when the diameter d of the conductive wire 10e was 60      microns. </PAR><PAR>  With the above-structure, the photosensitive drum 1 was rotated at a      peripheral speed of 40 mm/sec, and the charging wire 10 was supplied with      a vibratory voltage having a DC voltage component of -700 V and an AC      voltage component having a peak-to-peak voltage 1800 Vpp and a frequency      of 250 Hz. Then, the surface of the photosensitive member 1a was uniformly      charged approximately to -700 V without improper image due to pin holes or      without charging noise or very low charging noise. </PAR><PAR>  In this embodiment, the provision of the elastic member 10 reduces the      production of the charging noise. </PAR><PAR>  The flow of the image attributable to the plasticizer oozed out from the      conductive rubber layer as in the case of the charging roller or the      charging blade, was not observed. In addition, the partial improper      charging attributable to the rising of the charging member was not      observed. </PAR><PAR>  The advantageous effects of this embodiment is particularly significant      when the peak-to-peak voltage of the vibratory voltage is not less than      twice the charge starting voltage which is the voltage at which the      charging of the member to be charged starts when only a DC voltage is      applied. </PAR><PAR>  In this embodiment, the charge starting voltage when only the DC voltage      was applied was -560 V. </PAR><PAR>  With decrease of diameter, width or thickness of the wire (conductive      member) to which the voltage is applied, that is, with the decrease of the      width of the nip between the conductive wire and the member to be charged,      the level of the charging noise can be reduced to the practical extent or      can be practically eliminated. </PAR><PAR>  With the decrease of the width, the charging width becomes small, and as a      result, the resistance of the charging portion becomes large. Then, it      becomes more difficult for the current to flow, and therefore, the      improper charging action easily occurs. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 26, the contactable charging member 10 comprises a conductive wire      (conductive member) 10a having a circular cross-section and a coating 10b      (resistance material) on the outer periphery of the conductive wire. This      is press-contacted to the surface of the photosensitive drum 1 (member to      be charged) in the direction substantially parallel to the generating line      of the drum by confining members 11 and an urging members 12. A voltage is      applied to the conductive wire 10a from the voltage source 9 to effect the      charging of the photosensitive drum 1. If the width of the area in which      the conductive wire 10a of the charging member 10 is faced to the      photosensitive drum 1 (diameter of the wire 10a) is d, and the charging      width is L, the charging width L is substantially equal to the contact      area between the charging member 10 and the drum 1. The charging width L      is smaller than the width d. If the width d is reduced for the purpose of      reducing the charging noise, the charging width L decreases with the      result of possibility of improper charging. </PAR><PAR>  The charging width L can be determined in the following manner. The      photosensitive drum 1 is stopped. A bias voltage is applied to the      conductive wire 10a from the voltage source 9 for several minutes. Next,      the drum 1 is developed with a halftone level and an image is transferred      onto the transfer material. Then, on the transfer material, the developed      charge memory image is transferred. The width of the charge memory is the      charging width L. </PAR><PAR>  A charge limitation t means that if the surface of the charging member 10      is away from the surface of the photosensitive drum 1 by a distance not      less than t, the charging is not possible. This is determined by the      Passhen's Law. Under the normal ambient condition, it is several tens      microns. </PAR><PAR>  Therefore, in this system, the reduction of the width d in order to reduce      the produced charging noise has to be made in consideration of maintenance      of sufficient charging width L, and therefore, there is a limit. </PAR><PAR>  In this embodiment, the surface of the resistance member contactable to the      member to be charged is substantially flat. Therefore, as shown in FIG.      25, the charging width L becomes larger than the width d. </PAR><PAR>  The contactable charging member 10 of FIG. 25 uses a conductive wire having      a circular cross-section as the conductive member 10e, and the conductive      wire is attached to the bottom surface of an elongated elastic member 10g      made of MOLTOPREN or the like. The bottom side of the elastic material 10e      having having the wire 10e is entirely coated with a high resistance      material. The top surface of the elastic material 10g opposite from the      coating layer 10f is mounted to an urging plate 10h made of rigid      material. </PAR><PAR>  Since the coating layer 10f is made of resistance material, and since the      surface contactable to the member to be charged 1 is substantially flat,      the charging width (contact width) L is larger than the width d with which      the conductive wire is faced to the drum. </PAR><PAR>  The coating layer 10f side (resistance member) of the contactable charging      member 10 is urged to the surface of the photosensitive drum 1 against the      elasticity of the elastic member 10g, and a voltage is applied to the wire      10a to charge the photosensitive drum 1 surface. </PAR><PAR>  In this case, the charging width L increases relative to the width d, and      therefore, the width d may be made smaller to sufficiently suppress or      substantially eliminate the production of the charging noise, while      maintaining the sufficient charging width L. By doing so, the charging      operation is stabilized. </PAR><PAR>  The cross-section of the conductive member 10e is not limited to circle,      but may be rectangular, as shown in FIG. 27. </PAR><PAR>  In the devices shown in FIGS. 17-19, the following measurements were      effected. </PAR><PAR>  The voltage applied to the conductive member 10a of the charging wire 10      was a vibratory voltage containing a DC voltage component of -700 V and an      AC voltage component having a peak-to-peak voltage of 1800 Vpp and the      frequency of 250 Hz. The width d of the conductive member 10a, that is, a      diameter thereof was changed. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 28 shows the results of measurements of the charging noise. In FIG.      28, the abscissa represents the width (diameter) d of the conductive      member, and the ordinate represents the magnitude of the produced noise      (dB). </PAR><PAR>  If the width d exceeds 1000 microns, the noise level exceeds 50 dB which is      a practical noise limit. This applied to the AC voltage having the      peak-to-peak voltage and the frequency usually applied to the charging      member. </PAR><PAR>  The reasons are considered as follows. In the case of the contact charging,      upon application of the external bias to the contact charging member, the      contact charging member starts to vibrate. By the motion of the air      sandwiched between the contact charging member and the member to be      charged, and the charging noise is produced. When, however, the charging      wire 10 is thin as in this embodiment and as contrasted to the      conventional contact type charging roller having a large diameter the air      sandwiched by the charging member 10 and the member to be charged 1      decreased, and therefore, the noise production is decreased. </PAR><PAR>  If, however, the width d is too small, not more than 4 microns, then the      area of the charging portion decreases with the result of increased      charging resistance and the improper charging. The output images are      deteriorated as shown in the Table below. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 1                                                          ______________________________________                                         d .mu.m                                                                               10     9     8    7   6    5   4    3   2    1                          Image  G      G     G    G   G    G   N    N   N    N                          ______________________________________                                          G: Good, N: No good                                                       </TBL><PAR>  From the foregoing measurements, it has been confirmed that when the member      to be charged is charged by a conductive member supplied with a voltage,      directly or through a resistance member, the width d of the conductive      member faced to the member to be charged can be set so as to satisfy 5      micronsandlt;dandlt;1000 microns, by which the produced charging noise can be within      a practically tolerable range. </PAR><PAR>  When a coating layer 10b (resistance material) is used on the conductive      member 10a, the thickness may have something to do with the width d.      However, the thickness is generally small, and therefore, it will      substantially suffice that the width d of the conductive member 10a is      determined as described above. Rather, if the coating layer 10b is used,      the elastic property of the coating layer 10b reduces the charging noise. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIGS. 6-8, where plural charging wires are used, the charging      noise produced by the charging wires can be reduced by confining the width      d of each of the conductive members of the charging wires 10a and 10b.      However, it would be possible that the total noise would be large, and      therefore it is desirable that the sum of the conductive members of the      charging wires is within the above-described range. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 29A or FIG. 29B, the contact type charging member 10 may      be in the form of an integral molded member comprising one or more      conductive members 10a and a resistance member 10b, wherein the conductive      member or members embedded in the thickness of the resistance member 10b.      This is suitable for mass-production, and therefore, the cost can be      decreased. </PAR><PAR>  As described in the foregoing, the cross-section of the charging wire 10 is      not necessarily circular, but may be triangular, rectangular, oval or the      like, as shown in FIGS. 9A, 9B and 9C. In these cases, the contact area      between the photosensitive drum and the charging wire can be larger, and      therefore, as compared with the circular charging wire, the stabilized      charging becomes possible. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIGS. 9D, 9E, 9F and 9G, the outer periphery of the core metal      of the charging wire 10 may be coated with dielectric surface layer      10.sub.1 made of resin or the like (the thickness is 10-1000 microns, for      example). Or, as shown in FIGS. 9H, 9I, 9J and 9K, the surface layer      10.sub.1 may be formed at least at the contact portion with the member to      be charged. </PAR><PAR>  Usable materials for the surface layer 10.sub.1 includes n-methoxymethyl      nylon (Toresin (trade name), available from Teikoku Kagaku Sangyo      Kabushiki Kaisha, Japan), polyvinyl butyral resin material, polyurethane      resin material, ethylenevinyl acetate resin, styrene butadiene resin      material, fluorinated resin material in which low resistance powder      (carbon or the like) is dispersed (EMLARON (trade name), available from      Nihon Agison Kabushiki Kaisha), reproduced cellulose. As described      hereinbefore, if the rubber is not used, it is preferable because of no      liability of the plasticizer attaching to the photosensitive member.      However, in order simply to prevent the leakage, the usable material      includes epychlorohydrine, urethane, Cr, NBR rubber or the like. In this      case, it is preferable that the resin layer is provided on the side where      the charging member is contacted to the photosensitive member. It is      possible that heat-shrinking tube. </PAR><PAR>  The resin layer may comprise two or more layers. </PAR><PAR>  Among the above-described embodiments, if the charging member contacting      the member to be charged is in the form of a wire (outer diameter of      5-1000 microns), the silica particles or the toner particles having passed      under the cleaning device 6 are easily passed on the wire of the charging      member, as contrasted to the case of the charging blade. Therefore, they      are not so easily deposited on the charging wire. </PAR><PAR>  In the foregoing, the vibratory voltage applied between the charging member      and the photosensitive member contains the voltage provided by      periodically rendering a DC voltage on and off into a rectangular wave      voltage. </PAR><PAR>  The foregoing embodiments apply to the case of decreasing the electric      potential of the member to be charged (discharging) as well as increasing      the potential of the member to be charged. </PAR><PAR>  While the invention has been described with reference to the structures      disclosed herein, it is not confined to the details set forth and this      application is intended to cover such modifications or changes as may come      within the purposes of the improvements or the scope of the following      claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
