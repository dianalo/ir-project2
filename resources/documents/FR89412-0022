Such cracking, if not detected and corrected, could eventuallyresult in rapid depressurization of the fuselage, causing structural damageand possible loss of adjacent structure. Since issuance of AD 88-13-09, an operator of a Model DC-9 series airplanereported finding a 24-inch crack in the non-ventral aft pressure bulkheadtee while performing an unscheduled heavy maintenance inspection. Preliminaryanalysis of the tee revealed that the cracks initiated at multiple siteson the forward surface of the upstanding leg of the tee as the result ofmetal fatigue due to bending and preloads. The crack was detected on anon-ventral aft pressure bulkhead airplane having logged 36,079 landings,with 40,336 total hours on the fuselage. Fractrographic analysis revealedthat the crack had initiated at approximately 12,000 landings prior toits discovery. In light of this new report of cracking, the FAA has issued AD 89-06-04,Amendment 39-6152 (54 FR 11167; March 17, 1989), to reduce the thresholdand repetitive inspection interval on all non-ventral bulkheads in orderto adequately detect cracking in a timely manner. Review of the aft pressurebulkhead analysis substantiates, however, that the sequence of fatiguecracking is different between the non-ventral and ventral bulkheads. Therefore,the FAA is proposing this separate AD action to address only airplanesequipped with ventral aft pressure bulkheads. The FAA canvassed the affected airline operators through the Air TransportAssociation (ATA) of America and McDonnell Douglas to ascertain their experiencewith the low frequency eddy current inspection from the forward side ofthe bulkhead, defined as an option in AD 88-13-09. From information suppliedby those groups, the FAA has determined that, due to the complexity anddifficulty in performing that type of inspection, the results may not bereliable and, therefore, the inspection may not be effective. The FAA hasdetermined that a high frequency eddy current inspection of the part number5910163-51, -53, and -54 attach tees from the aft side of the bulkhead,coupled with an optically aided visual inspection, will more adequatelydetect cracking in the attach tee area. In addition, the FAA has determinedthat sealant must be removed from the inspection area prior to inspection.The FAA has determined that, due to the multiple-site nature of the reportedcracking, continued operation of airplanes with cracks is unacceptable.Accordingly, this proposed action would not permit the interim repair forcertain cracks as described in paragraph C.2.a. of AD 88-13-09. The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas Alert Service BulletinA53-231, dated February 24, 1989, which describes procedures for high frequencyeddy current inspections of the attach tee area, and repair or replacement,if necessary. Since this unsafe condition may exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type design equipped with a ventral aft pressure bulkhead, anAD is proposed which would supersede AD 88-13-09 and require repetitivehigh frequency eddy current and optically aided visual inspections of theentire periphery of the attach tee from the aft side of the bulkhead, andrepair or replacement, if necessary. Subsequent inspections would alsobe required after any repair or replacement. Additionally, affected operatorswould be required to remove sealant from the inspection area prior to inspection.There are approximately 1,400 Model DC-9 series airplanes in the worldwidefleet. It is estimated that 740 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affectedby this AD, that it would take approximately 20 manhours per airplane toaccomplish the required actions, and that the average labor cost wouldbe $40 per manhour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of theAD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $592,000. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For these reasons, the FAA has determined that this document (1) involvesa proposed regulation which is not major under Executive Order 12291 and(2) is not a significant rule under Department of Transportation RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11O34; February 26, 1979); and it is furthercertified under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that thisproposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact,positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities becausefew, if any, McDonnell Douglas Model DC-9 and C-9 (Military) series, includingModel DC-9-80 series and Model MD-88 airplanes, are operated by small entities.A copy of a draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is containedin the regulatory docket. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend andSection; 39.13 ofPart 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
