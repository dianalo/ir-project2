That question is the heart of an unusual arbitration casenow being heard by a panel of the National Association ofSecurities Dealers against Prudential Securities, thenation's fourth-largest brokerage firm and a unit ofPrudential Insurance Co. of America.</LP><TEXT>   In the case, Mark D. Schwartz, a former investment bankerin Prudential Securities' public-finance department, accusedPrudential Securities executives of threatening employeeswith dismissal or denying bonuses if they refused tocontribute a percentage of their annual pay to variouspolitical candidates. The requests were for as much as 5% ofemployees' pay, people familiar with the case said.   &quot;If they did not contribute according to the percentagesthey would not have either a bonus or job to worry about,&quot;the complaint said.   In a statement, Prudential Securities said: &quot;The policy ofthis firm is that political contributions are a personal andvoluntary act. In our view, the allegations are without meritand we are vigorously defending our position. They were madeby a disgruntled employee making unsubstantiated claims abouthis former firm.&quot;   Wall Street investment banks have long used campaigncontributions to curry favor among politicians and winpublic-finance underwriting business. But it's rare that asecurities firm is publicly accused of strong-armingemployees to dole out part of their pay to candidates of thefirms' choice. Most securities firms, including PrudentialSecurities, have policies that bar employees from tyingpolitical contributions to job requirements or takingretribution for failure to donate.   The case comes as Prudential Securities tries to boost itspublic-finance market share. In 1991, Prudential Securitiesranked No. 8 among municipal-bond underwriters, helping toissue $5.8 billion, for a 3.4% market share, according toSecurities Data Co.   Separately, a St. Louis grand jury has subpoenaedPrudential Securities and nearly 20 other securities firmsregarding contributions, among other things, people familiarwith the inquiry said. The case has &quot;nothing to do with us,&quot;said a person familiar with Prudential Securities, which iscooperating.   Mr. Schwartz, currently a senior vice president at A.Webster Dougherty andamp; Co., a Philadelphia bond firm, couldn'tbe reached to comment on his case. His lawyer declined tocomment.   Mr. Schwartz said in his complaint he was fired fromPrudential Securities in 1989 after complaining about thethreats to those who didn't contribute to candidates. Mr.Schwartz was treasurer of Prudential Securities' Muni-Pac,which raised funds for political candidates; he also wascounsel to the firm's tax-exempt division.   In the complaint, Mr. Schwartz accused John C. GliddenJr., former head of Prudential Securities' public-financedepartment, of telling employees &quot;that he had insisted uponpolitical contributions based on a percentage of gross incomewhen he handed out the bonus checks.&quot;   Said a person familiar with Prudential Securities: &quot;It'suntrue that anybody said, `If you don't give checks {tocandidates}, you're out of here' -- I don't believe thathappened.&quot; But another person close to the firm said that &quot;itis possible that some lower and mid-level managers may beperceived as putting too much pressure&quot; on employees tocontribute to political campaigns.   Prudential Securities fired Mr. Glidden earlier thismonth. The firm says that the decision had nothing to do withthe pending arbitration case or grand jury proceeding.   Repeated attempts to reach Mr. Glidden were unsuccessful.His duties at Prudential Securities are being carried out byfour &quot;intermediaries&quot; until a permanent successor can befound, a spokesman said.   Mr. Schwartz also accused Gerald P. McBride, a PrudentialSecurities senior vice president, of ordering him to destroya copy of the firm's contributor list to Richard Daley'sChicago mayoral campaign. Mr. Schwartz says he toldPrudential Securities executives that those contributionsexceeded legal limits.   Mr. McBride couldn't be reached to comment.   Mr. Schwartz is seeking $500,000 in compensatory andpunitive damages. Compensatory damages are awarded to cover aclaimant's loss; punitive damages are awarded to punish anddeter a defendant found to have acted recklessly ormaliciously.   The case was first disclosed in New York Newsday, whichreported that at least 35 members of Prudential Securities'public finance department contributed a total of about $5,500to David Dinkins' 1989 New York mayoral campaign, amongothers. Prudential Securities notes that the contributionsare small; they amount to about $150 a person.   Prudential Securities uses more subtle ways to encourageemployees to donate. The big brokerage firm periodicallysends letters to its employees at home urging them tocontribute to various politicians, people familiar with thefirm said.   The firm makes it easy to donate: It offers to deduct thecontributions from employees' paychecks.</TEXT></DOC>
