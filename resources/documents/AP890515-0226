MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Strains, stress and headaches overdisagreements among allies are nothing new in the Atlanticalliance. But this time there's a difference _ no more Mr. Bad Guyacross the table.   For 40 years, internal discord in the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization always has yielded to common concern about theperceived menace from Moscow.   Now that perception has changed. Two generations of Soviet coldwarriors have given way to a masterful political salesman. AndMikhail S. Gorbachev's wares are making it more difficult for theBush administration to sell its argument for modernizing NATO'sshort-range nuclear missiles.   As President Bush prepares for NATO's 40th anniversary summit atthe end of May, the missile dispute looms as a dominant issue. Sofar, it defies compromise, with the United States and Great Britainopposed to immediate negotiations and determined to modernize themissiles, while the West German government of Chancellor HelmutKohl insists on talks now.   Bush says he thinks the missile differences can be settled, thata lot of it is just smoke, and that ``we'll have a smooth summit.''   ``This alliance is not going to fall apart,'' the presidentsaid. ``It is going to stay together and be strong, and we'll workit out.'' Bush has tried personally, by telephone. Secretary ofDefense Dick Cheney and Secretary of State James A. Baker III have,too.   As Cheney observed, ``It's not the first time we've haddifferences ... You've got 16 sovereign nations with differentviewpoints, different political situations at home.''   But Gorbachev knows an opening when he sees one. When Baker methim in Moscow last Thursday, the Soviet president upped his ante abit, saying he plans to cut about 500 weapons from the Warsaw Pactarsenal. It's a token _ the Soviets are believed to have about10,000 nuclear weapons, from bombs down to shells, in the Europeanbalance. NATO has about 4,000 that can be used at short range.   Baker called the surprise move a small step but a good one. Healso said that NATO has scrapped five times that many nuclearweapons over the past decade.   Nevertheless, the timing of Gorbachev's ante can only add to theEuropean pressure the administration is trying to withstand. Bydefinition, short-range missiles are the ones that go off in theneighborhood, and to the Germans that means Germany, East or West.There is wide public support for negotiations to get rid of themissiles in West Germany, and that leaves Kohl little room tomaneuver on the issue.   Bush will be in Brussels May 28-30 for a NATO summit followedimmediately by a visit to Bonn for separate conferences with Kohl.The two men spent a half hour on the telephone on May 5, butneither budged. Gorbachev is to visit Bonn June 12-15.   By the numbers, the administration has a solid case, because theSoviet Union has a lot more to give or barter away. ``We believethe vast Soviet superiority and Warsaw pact conventional forcesmust be reduced before we can discuss reductions in short rangenuclear missiles,'' White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwatersaid in summation of the administration stand.   But numbers aren't everything, and the net result is to cast theUnited States as the intransigent party, the side that won't evennegotiate. That's an unfamiliar and uncomfortable posture.   Twenty years ago, President Richard M. Nixon traveled to Europeon much the same route Bush will take at the end of this month, andwith a similar mission. NATO was in crisis then, too. PresidentCharles De Gaulle had pulled France out of the military structureof NATO.   Nixon told the allies that he would be entering negotiationswith the Soviet Union on a wide array of issues, and he promised``full and genuine consultation before and during thosenegotiations.''   That's almost the opposite of the problem facing Bush as heheads for Rome, Brussels, Bonn and London.   In an appraisal of U.S. foreign policy this year, Nixon saidhe'd once been told that fear, not love, holds alliances together.He said fear of the Soviet Union has waned, ``and what love mayexist between economic competitors in the West is a very weak glueto hold an alliance together.''   A top administration official summed up the difference anotherway, in one word:   Gorbachev.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
