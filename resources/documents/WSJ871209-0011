A spokesman for the aluminum producer said the decision to restart the line, which has been shut since March 1985, isn't directly related to a labor dispute at Alcan's Shawinigan, Quebec, smelter but he conceded that the restart &quot;alleviates pressure in the Alcan system.&quot;    The Shawinigan smelter, with annual capacity of 84,000 metric tons of aluminum, has been closed since Oct. 31, when Alcan locked out 485 unionized employees in a contract dispute. The workers, represented by the Confederation of National Trade Unions, had conducted four one-day strikes in the three weeks prior to the lockout.    The Kentucky facility, Alcan's only U.S. smelter, has annual capacity of 163,000 metric tons. Each potline has one-third of that total, or about 54,000 metric tons.    The Alcan spokesman said the decision to restart the smelter is based on current and projected market demand for aluminum and was taken despite &quot;high restart costs and high power costs.&quot; It will take three months to resume full production on the line.    Alcan said it will hire 135 new employees to staff the line, bringing the Kentucky smelter's total employment to 750.    Peter Merner, a New York-based aluminum analyst, said he doesn't link the restart at Henderson to the Shawinigan dispute. &quot;I think they would have started it anyway,&quot; he said, because high aluminum prices make the Kentucky facility profitable.    Separately, Alcan and the union at Shawinigan said they plan to resume negotiations Friday, at the request of a labor conciliator appointed by the Quebec government. The main issue in dispute concerns work schedules.    Meanwhile, talks continue between Alcan and the Federation des Syndicats du Secteur Aluminium, another union representing most of Alcan's 6,000 Quebec employees, who work at smelters providing half of the company's Canadian output. The employees are continuing to work under terms of the previous contract, which expired Aug. 30.    The Alcan spokesman said that talks are progressing but that he doesn't believe there will be a settlement before Christmas.    Alcan has 1,075,000 metric tons of smelting capacity in Canada and 163,000 metric tons in the U.S. A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. </TEXT></DOC>
