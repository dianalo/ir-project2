Intent on solidifying ties with Mexico, the organization IMPACTO2000 met with Salinas for 45 minutes Thursday night to outline theirplan. It was Salinas' first trip to Baja California since he tookoffice Dec. 1.   The proposal would create cooperatives to deal with cross-borderissues including commerce, education, immigration, culture andhealth care.   Saying positive changes already are occurring in several of thoseareas in Mexico, the president told 300 delegates of the group thathe welcomed the plan and would direct various Mexican agencies tobegin preparing the framework to deal with some of the issues.   ``We will continue to work. We have a good relationship with theU.S. government and the Congress and an especially harmoniousrelationship with the Mexican-American community,'' Salinas said.``We will continue that relationship with the future generations ofMexican-Americans.''   The coalition, which wants to spur progress on these problems bythe year 2000, includes representatives from churches, immigrationcenters, Hispanic elected officials and Hispanic professional andstudent groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizensand the GI Forum.   The proposal submitted to Salinas seeks to create a binationalcommission that would include Mexican agencies and leaders fromthose business, education, church, student and labor sectors. Itexcludes the U.S. government.   Armando Navarro, director of the San Bernardino, Calif.-basedInstitute for Social Justice, said the U.S. government was left outbecause it has underestimated America's relationship with Mexico fortoo long.   However, IMPACTO realizes that the growing Hispanic population inthe United States is an issue that has to be addressed, Navarro said.   About 20 million Hispanics live in the United States today, 62percent of them born there, Navarro said. He said projectionsindicate half of California's residents by 2030 will be Hispanic.   Members of the 4-year-old coalition met with Salinas last yearand the president promised to listen to their proposal after he waselected.</TEXT></DOC>
