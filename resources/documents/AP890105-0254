William Seidman, chairman ofthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., told the House BankingCommittee.   ``While large LDC exposure by some major banks will be with usfor years to come, at this time we cannot foresee any bank failuresresulting from LDC exposure alone,'' Seidman said.   Manuel H. Johnson, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,said U.S. bank exposure to the 15 major Third World debtors declinedby $8.6 billion between July 1987 and the same month last year to$76 billion.   ``A disproiportionate share of this reduction was accounted forby large regional banks, as distinct from the largest multinationalbanks,'' Johnson said. ``Nonetheless, the top nine banks reducedtheir total exposure over the year by $2.6 billion (to $53billion).''   He said small and regional banks have largely abandoned furtherinternational lending in developing countries and have reduced whatexposure they had by selling or swapping the loans at discounts onsecondary markets.   The larger banks, he said, have not been willing to discounttheir loans to the Third World countries as much.   Seidman said the nine major U.S. money center banks have reducedtheir outstanding loans to 31 less developed countries from $61billion in December 1982 to roughly $55 billion as of last year.   During the same period, he said, they have raised their aggregateprimary capital from $32 billion to $65 billion.   Meanwhile, the debt servicing capacity of the six largestborrowers _ Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, the Philippines andVenezuela _ well exceeds the 40 percent value the secondary marketis putting on the loans, Seidman said.   President-elect Bush promised last month to ``take a whole newlook'' at Third World debt now estimated at $1.32 trillion,including loans from other countries and multinational institutionssuch as the World Bank.   But former Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, Bush's nomineeto be the new secretary of state, and Treasury Secretary NicholasBrady both declined an invitation to testify at today's hearing.   The committee's new chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,said Wednesday he was disappointed but added he expects theadministration to develop a policy quickly on what he called a``growing crisis.''   Seidman and Johnson declined to characterize the situation as acrisis, saying there has been great progress since 1982 when Mexicosuddenly stopped paying interest on its debt because of plummetingoil prices.   At the time, some feared that the whole international bankingsystem could collapse. The book value of loans from U.S. banks toThird World countries then was $139.7 billion and the banks had only$66.2 billion in capital to cover them if the countries defaulted.   While the book value of the loans has fallen by $42 billion,banks have increased their capital to $139.7 billion, as of lastJune, the congressional General Accounting Office said Wednesday,greatly reducing their exposure.   The GAO said a major component of the turnaround was $2.3 billionthat regulators required the banks to set aside as special reservesand another $20 billion that banks have voluntarily set aside overthe past year and a half to cover loan losses.   However, that is not enough, the GAO said, estimating that $49billion of loss reserves would more accurately reflect thediminished value of the loans.   Meanwhile, the World Bank says Third World countries in 1988 paidout $43 billion more in servicing the debt than they received in newloans and investments from developed countries.   ``Although the banks increased their reserves because they knowthey are not going to be repaid in full, they continue to insist ondebt-service payments based on face value,'' the Rev. J. BryanHehir, a social policy counselor for the U.S. Catholic Conference,told the committee.   The result of austerity programs to service the debt, Hehir said,is growing poverty, malnutrition and unemployment and _ because ofcuts in health programs _ the reappearance of diseases thought tohave been eradicated.   ``Living standards in the 1980s have declined more than 25percent in sub-Saharan Africa and 15 percent in Latin America, andboth regions are deeper in debt than ever,'' he said. ``...All ofthis spells recession, leads Latin Americans in particular toquestion their leaders' economic strategy and breeds revolution.''</TEXT></DOC>
