Federal law enforcement officials said the indictment,returned by a grand jury in Dallas, is the first time federalmoney-laundering statutes have been applied in a thrift fraudcase.</LP><TEXT>   The six defendants are accused of concocting a complicatedscheme to use funds borrowed from Caprock Savings to buystock in the thrift's now-defunct parent company, Great WestBanc Shares Inc. The parent company then used the funds toshore up the thrift's sagging net worth, according to theindictment.   The money-laundering charges arise from allegations thatthe borrowed funds were shuffled among accounts, includingtrust accounts held by the lawyers, to disguise their source.   The four former executives charged in the indictment areGeorge F. Dillman, who was chairman and chief executiveofficer; William C. Hatfield, chairman of the executivecommittee; Kenneth L. Hird, general counsel and chief lendingofficer; and Anthony C. Nims, president.   Caprock was placed under federal supervision Aug. 1, 1989,and was closed last Sept. 1 at an estimated cost of $299million.   Also indicted yesterday were lawyers James D. EgglestonJr. and Mary Lou Garcia, both formerly associated with thedisbanded Dallas law firm of Hoover andamp; Eggleston.   Mr. Dillman's attorney, Jim Burnham of Dallas, said hisclient was &quot;just shocked&quot; by the indictment. Mr. Dillman,until about seven months ago, was chairman of the DallasPolice Review Board, a citizens' panel that investigatescomplaints against police and had previously served asforeman of the Dallas County grand jury.   None of the other defendants or their attorneys could bereached for comment. The defendants are scheduled tosurrender to federal authorities today in Dallas.
