Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, testifying before theSenate Judiciary Committee, said it is difficult to get fundsfrom individuals convicted of Sandamp;L fraud and ordered to payrestitution. Of $2.5 million in restitution ordered by courtsthis year, Mr. Thornburgh said $50 had been coughed up sofar. Of $3.1 million ordered in 1989, $2,700 has been paid.The department has fared better with the $5.8 million inrestitution that courts decreed in 1988: $21,000 has beenpaid.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Thornburgh noted ruefully that while he expects theJustice Department to successfully prosecute hundreds of Sandamp;Lexecutives, the department is unlikely to win back sums thatwill make a dent in the cost of the taxpayer-financedbailout, estimated at up to $500 billion with interest.   Mr. Thornburgh also said he expects it will take fiveyears for the department to handle the bulk of the Sandamp;L casesand &quot;perhaps begin winding down and transferring someresources to other areas.&quot;   Meanwhile, real estate seized from defunctsavings-and-loans probably won't be sold in the planned $500million chunks before next year, the Resolution Trust Corp.said.   Prospective buyers will need a lot of time to examine thebig packages of real estate and loans, said Lamar Kelly, theofficial in charge of asset sales for the Sandamp;L cleanup agency.The agency must hire investment advisers as well as firms toprepare and evaluate the bids.   The RTC will provide up to 85% financing for the packages,which will include hard-to-sell loans and real estate. Thesales of three bulk packages, part of a pilot project, aren'texpected to close until the first quarter of 1991.   The agency also is in the midst of selling $716 million ofloans in four packages. The sales don't require governmentfinancing and are expected to be completed soon, the agencysaid.</TEXT></DOC>
