That may not be easy. The bank has been doing business outof another company's office in a strip mall in ChesterCounty, Pa., just outside of Philadelphia. It has no state orfederal charter, no deposit insurance, no state license tooperate as a corporation and, as far as state regulators cantell, no legitimate purpose.</LP><TEXT>   It does, however, have about $1 million in customerdeposits.   Last week, Pennsylvania's top bank regulator, Sarah W.Hargrove, froze the accounts, which Settlers had placed in areal bank, and ordered it to take out newspaperadvertisements warning future customers that Settlers isunlicensed and uninsured. Then she turned the matter over tothe state attorney general for possible criminal charges.   Bogus banks and bankers are not a major problem inPennsylvania, but they do pop up from time to time, said Ms.Hargrove. The worst case occurred earlier this year whensomeone in Philadelphia tried to open an account with a checkdrawn on a non-existent bank in the Cayman Islands.   That one was nipped in the bud, says Ms. Hargrove. TheSettlers case is more unsettling because customers, about adozen rural financial institutions in the Southeast, actuallydeposited money in the non-existent bank. Lured by promisesof high interest rates for their own depositors and actingthrough brokers, each institution wired $99,000 to Settlers,which in turn deposited the money in another bank, accordingto Ms. Hargrove. That bank, thinking the deposits suspicious,alerted state authorities last month, she said.   Settler's office in Exton, Pa., it turned out, was reallythe office of Delaware Capital Corp., headed by ChesterCounty resident James R. Paisley Jr. Mr. Paisley, DelawareCapital's sole officer, couldn't be reached for comment.Neither could his attorney in nearby West Grove, Pa., whoseown office served as the mailing address for Settlers Trust andamp;Savings Bank.   &quot;I'd rather not discuss anything,&quot; said an employee ofDelaware Capital in a brief telephone interview. Statebanking officials also don't want to discuss too manydetails, and are quick to add that none of the moneyentrusted with Settlers has been withdrawn.   &quot;It doesn't happen all that often,&quot; said a spokeswoman forMs. Hargrove's office. &quot;And thank heavens it doesn't.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
