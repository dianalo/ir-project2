Women forced to seek jobs outside the home after spending yearsas full-time homemakers often lack training and have to takepart-time, seasonal jobs, Miller said.   The number of displaced homemakers rose 12 percent over the pastdecade, from 13.9 million in 1980 to 15.6 million in 1989, accordingto a report by the Washington-based group based on Census Bureaufigures.   Displaced homemakers are women whose main job was homemaking, butwho lost their key source of income through widowhood, divorce,separation or because a spouse suffered disability or long-termunemployment.   ``We are penalizing (homemakers) and leaving them high and drywhen they make that choice,'' she said, noting that other workersare eligible for unemployment benefits.   Nearly three in five displaced homemakers were living near orbelow the poverty level, the report said. About one in five, or 3million American women, are living in households with otherfamilies, it said.   The group said there were 22 million American married women in1989 who were full-time homemakers.</TEXT></DOC>
