It's the Sahel, a regionthe ``Green Revolution'' forgot and is not likely to remember.   The land is poor, the people are poor, and there are too many ofthem. The outlook is grim, says Agriculture Department economistJohn Day.   ``If the Sahel's population of 38 million keeps growing at itsannual rate of 2.8 percent, it will double in about 25 years,'' hesaid. ``The land's carrying capacity _ its ability to provide foodand fiber for humans and animals without losing long-termproductivity _ has already been exceeded.''   If current population trends continue, along with current farmingtechnologies, the population of the Sahel will exceed the land'scarrying capacity by about 30 million people by the turn of thecentury, Day said.   Collectively, he said, the eight countries that make up the Sahelcomprise the only region in the world where population growth hasoutpaced increases in food production over the last 20 years.   The countries are Senegal, Gambia, Mauritania, Mali, BurkinaFaso, Niger, Chad and Cape Verde.   Only 4 percent of the region is arable, or fit for crops. Thebalance is desert, 59 percent; permanent pasture, 26 percent; andwoodlands, 11 percent.   Per capita food production declined about 1.6 percent annuallyfrom 1962 to 1988 and is highly variable from year to year, Daywrites in the July issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine.   Gains in overall food output have come primarily from expandingcrop plantings into marginal lands and by cropping traditional farmplots more intensively, he said. But the average yields of foodcrops have dropped the past 20 years.   As soil degradation develops, land is turned into desert. It isthis ``desertification'' process that has caused concerns in someother parts of the world, not only in the Sahel.   Day outlined some of the steps that he thinks could be taken ifthe Sahel is to slow its downward spin and relieve some of theregion's dependence on imports and food aid.   ``Even during 1986 and 1987, when weather was better and domesticproduction was up, imports and food aid made up about 20 percent ofthe region's food supply,'' he said.   Economic policies have stunted farmers' incentives to adopt newtechnology and have strongly affected production methods, Day said.   For example, he said, Sahelian currencies are over-valued, whichmakes imports relatively cheap and exports expensive. And thatencourages food imports and depresses farm prices. Urban wages areartificially high, and cheap food policies hamper production.   Large-scale irrigation systems hold little promise in the Sahel,at least for the present, Day said. Eighty-five percent of theregion gets less than 24 inches of rainfall annually.   The Green Revolution technology dramatically boosted cropproduction in Asia, Latin America and other parts of Africa, but notin the Sahel.   Day said the Green Revolution's output growth was based largelyon gains from high-yielding crop varieties, which are mostlyeffective when combined with ample water and chemical fertilizers.   But water control, or irrigation, is largely absent in the Sahel.Sahelian farmers have generally rejected the Green Revolutionapproach because the high-yielding varieties rarely outperformtraditional crops there.   ``Farmers have learned that applying fertilizers in semiaridregions lacking water control is very risky, with a high probabilityof economic loss,'' he said.   Day said one of the questions is whether traditional productiontechniques can be modified to boost productivity and meet theSahel's needs. Development specialists, he said, ``are not convincedthat a low-resource approach by itself can achieve theseobjectives.''   Basically, that would involve animal and human labor in croppingsystems that use manures and few purchased production ``inputs''such as machines or fertilizer and other chemicals.   Dryland farming techniques already used in India, Australia, theUnited States and other countries could be adapted to the Sahel.   ``Research shows that using moisture-conserving furrow-dikes andchemical fertilizers, for example, could raise the Sahel's foodproduction and farm income 50 percent to 70 percent, and reduce soilerosion by as much as 70 percent,'' Day said.   ``Farming will always be risky in the Sahel,'' he said. ``Butmore efforts to conserve soil and water could cut the risks.''   Day said ``efforts to encourage voluntary population control areimportant'' and could ``help bring the population into closerbalance with the land's carrying capacity.''   Lester R. Brown, head of Worldwatch Institute, a private,Washington-based research organization, has warned for many years ofdesertification, the abuse of farmland and forests, and the need forcurbing population growth.   ``Unfortunately, farmers alone cannot brighten the world's foodprospects,'' Brown said in his 1989 report, ``State of the World.''``Without the help of national leaders and family planners inslowing population growth, the hunger and malnutrition that hasalready engulfed large parts of Africa and Latin America will deepenand spread.''   Brown added: ``Population stabilization is the only acceptablegoal in a world where growth in human numbers is leading to alife-threatening deterioration of environmental systems.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday July 16</NOTE></DOC>
