The $54 million failure of National County Mutual Fire InsuranceCo., which had an estimated 100,000 policyholders, triggered a stateinquiry into the State Board of Insurance and the industry itself.   With 42 Texas-based insurance companies and 98 that do businessin the state being liquidated, fears are growing that Texas insurersare following the same road as Sandamp;Ls.   ``The potential is there,'' said State Rep. Eddie Cavazos,D-Corpus Christi, House Insurance Committee chairman of budget andoversight. ``I don't think we have gotten to the bottom of the pit(of insolvent insurance companies) and the closer we get to thebottom, the more horror stories I hear.''   A state auditor's report issued last week estimated theliabilities of insurance companies in receivership exceeded theirassets by an estimated $200 million to $300 million as of Aug. 31.   State officials say the factors that bedevil the insuranceindustry are the same as those that endangered the thrifts: lax andinept regulators, depressed real estate and oil markets andfreespending company officials.   In 1987, Texans paid an estimated $26 billion for insurancepremiums, the audit said.   The audit urged the insurance board to make identifyingfinancially troubled insurance companies its highest priority.   Regulators came under sharp criticism for their handling ofNational County, whose president, Robert H. Walker, is believed tobe in Switzerland.   The insurance board staff knew about National County's problemsas early as 1986 but did not move to place the Dallas-based casualtyand property insurer in receivership until Oct. 24, 1988.   A legislative report showed it took an average of more than oneyear from the time examiners knew a company was in deep financialtrouble and the time it was placed into conservatorship.   In December, when Insurance Commissioner Doyce Lee resigned underpressure, he described the agency as under siege, trying to keep upwith the insurance industry after years of being understaffed andunderfunded while the sour economy brought on record insolvencies.   During 1987 the agency was reorganized and its staff expandedfrom about 850 employees to 1,300. Board members said thereorganization contributed to the problems.   But state Sen. John Montford, D-Lubbock, blamed ``inept''management.   ``They're running at a pace that would have worked in the1930s,'' he said.   Montford, who chairs the state Senate Affairs Committee thatconducted hearings on National County's failure, has sponsored 11bills aimed at restructuring the insurance board. Also being draftedis a measure that would set up an oversight panel.   Regulatory and criminal investigations are under way to determinewhat led to National County's insolvency, the costliest in Texashistory. The company's primary business was automobile insurance forhigh-risk drivers.   Insurance board liquidator James T. Odiorne has filed a lawsuitagainst Walker and his sons, alleging that Walker ``and perhapsothers'' diverted premium money to affiliated companies.   Also named in the suit are Texas National Insurance Co., SouthernLife Investment Co., Bent Tree National Bank, Western Fire andamp;Casualty Insurance Co. Ltd., Walker National General Agency Inc. andSuperior Premium Finance Inc.   As in the savings and loans crisis, consumers could end upfooting part of the bill to pay claims, which are expected to total$40 million.   Initially, claims will be paid through the Texas Property andCasualty Guaranty Fund, supported by healthy insurance companies butsubsidized indirectly by the state.   Tax credits the state gives to insurance companies thatcontribute to the guaranty fund translate into lost state treasuryrevenue, leaving taxpayers to make up the deficit.   The new insurance commissioner, A.W. ``Woody'' Pogue, said heexpects more failures, but none of the magnitude of National County.   ``We've made a lot of changes on the board,'' he said. ``I'm veryoptimistic that we've turned it around.''</TEXT></DOC>
