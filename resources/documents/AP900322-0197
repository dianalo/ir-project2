Almost likemom's apple pie, or dad's, as the case may be.   But there's a darker side, and special people in the AgricultureDepartment are looking into the cubbyholes and stairwells to seewhat evil lurks in the name of conservation.   Another major interest is USDA employee integrity and possibleconflicts of interest within such big divisions as the Farmers HomeAdministration, the so-called lender of last resort for low-incomerural people.   The specialists are the auditors and criminal investigators ofthe Office of Inspector General, an agency of 850 employees chargedwith preventing and detecting fraud, waste and abuse.   Conservation and FmHA are only a couple of targets in theinspector general's hunting grounds. Every USDA agency and programoperated by the department _ and the non-federal entities thatreceive USDA aid _ is subject to scrutiny.   But the huge expansion of the Conservation Reserve Programauthorized by the 1985 farm law is one of the main focal points ofthis year's sleuthing operations.   The program is administered by the department's AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service, the sprawling agency thatfor decades has channeled federal commodity programs to farmersthrough more than 2,800 county offices.   Accountants and auditors look at financial statements, reviewagency compliance with laws and regulations and sniff out flaws inoperations that impair effectiveness. The investigators are specialagents who specialize mostly in crimes involving USDA programs.   According to the 105-page annual plan for the fiscal year thatbegan Oct. 1, the inspector general's team is attempting to``identify large-scale schemes and devices used by financialinstitutions and others'' to evade $50,000-per-year paymentlimitations specified under Conservation Reserve Program contracts.   ``The scope (of the audits) will be limited to individuals,entities or financial institutions that received a large number ofCRP payments but were not in the land management business prior tothe CRP,'' the report said.   One of the tasks is the evaluation of land and producereligibility for the program. The program enables a farmer to takehighly erodible cropland from production for 10 years and plant itin protective grass and trees.   In exchange, the government helps pay the cost of installing theprotective cover, plus annual rental payments, which average around$50 an acre. About 34 million acres are in the program so far; thetarget is to have at least 40 million.   Related audits are under way to see if the AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service established effectivecontrols to verify that farmers receiving 1989 disaster assistancecomplied properly with requirements to purchase federal cropinsurance for the 1989 crop year. Other rules also are being lookedat.   ``A recent audit survey disclosed several instances where landenrolled was not farmed during the base period years and thereforewas ineligible,'' the report said. ``Some farmers have submittedfalse records to ASCS to show that acreage was planted in prioryears.''   Another round of audits is directed at 1989 drought aid to seeif crop yields and payment rates were properly used in computingassistance for ``non-program'' crops covered by last year's law.   On the investigation side, most work originates from referralsby USDA or other federal agencies and individuals. Priorities aregiven to threats to public health and safety; employee integrity,including allegations of bribery, embezzlement, and theft orcollusion with program recipients; and fraud in the loan andbenefit programs.   Recent disclosures of influence-peddling and other improprietiesin the Department of Housing and Urban Development prompted theinspector general's planners to ``conduct an evaluation of thecontrols over and the propriety of rural rental housing projectapprovals'' in the Farmers Home Administration, the report said.   ``We also plan to conduct a review of the statements certainofficials are required to file concerning outside financialinterests (and) an evaluation of management controls over theprevention, detection and resolution of prohibited employeeactivities, such as conflicts of interest,'' the report said.   Additionally, the inspector general's plan calls for ``adetermination of the feasibility of requiring financial disclosurestatements by all loan-approval and payment-approval officials.''   Food programs, including food stamps, school lunches and otherchild-nutrition functions, are fertile grounds for investigators onthe prowl for fraud and abuse.   This year, for example, the agency projects that about 33percent of its investigative work will involve the Food andNutrition Service. About 23 percent will be directed to FarmersHome Administration operations and 17 percent to the AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service.   Food stamp fraud has often involved large-scale operations inwhich thousands or millions of dollars have changed hands throughthe illegal use of the federal coupons. In some cases, the stampshave been used as currency for prohibited items, including liquorand drugs.   ``Since the authorized retailer is the key to eventualredemption of illegally obtained food stamps, we will continue toplace major emphasis in this area,'' the report said.   ``We will also look at unauthorized retailers, including thosepreviously disqualified from the food stamp program for seriousviolations who continue to accept food stamps in willful disregardof program regulations.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 25</NOTE></DOC>
