The Fed gave evidence just before the Thanksgiving holiday thatit was taking further steps to relax its credit policy.   For the second time this month, it engaged in maneuvers thatencouraged a decline in short-term interest rates.   The earlier easing didn't cause much of a stir, analysts say,partly because it didn't touch off any dramatic moves in the bankprime lending rate. But the latest actions by the central bankmight ``make a bigger splash,'' said Douglas Schindewolf at SmithBarney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.   ``If the Fed is trying to reduce general recession fears, thepolicy move in early November seems to have fallen short,'' heobserved. ``In order to reach general psychology, the easing wouldneed to grab the headlines.''   That may come soon, he suggested, in the form of a generalreduction in the prime rate. Talk also has spread on the Streetthat the Fed might reinforce its message by lowering the discountrate, the charge it sets on loans to private financial institutions.   The latest developments don't necessarily signal that AlanGreenspan, the Fed's chairman, has abandoned the gradualist stylethat has become his trademark, observers say.   Nor do Wall Streeters think the central bank has dropped itscampaign against inflation as economic enemy No. 1.   But ``inflation _ the Fed's top priority _ is contained,'' saidMaury Harris, economist at PaineWebber Inc. ``Recession risks haverisen.''   If all goes right, analysts say, the Fed will be able to bringoff the much-ballyhooed ``soft landing'' for the economy as 1990begins, letting interest rates fall and setting the stage forrenewed expansion later on.   But some doubts persist that it can achieve that tricky feat.``Signs of a downturn are in view,'' contends Erich Heinemann atLadenburg, Thalmann andamp; Co.   ``Mr. Greenspan has responded to the softening in the economy.He has also responded to heavy-handed pressure from the Bushadministration, which is worried about the prospect of furtherDemocratic gains in the congressional elections in 1990.''   Whatever the motivations, stock and bond traders found a lot tolike in the Fed's latest actions.   After getting off to a weak start, the Dow Jones average of 30industrials rose 22.89 to 2,675.55 in the past week.   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.01 to190.29, while the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-countermarket slipped .09 to 456.63 and the American Stock Exchange marketvalue index fell .21 to 373.14.   Volume on the Big Board averaged 127.02 million shares a dayduring the holiday-shortened week, against 147.69 million the weekbefore.   ``The most recent economic reports confirm that businessactivity is slowing,'' said analysts at Wright Investors' Service,a Bridgeport, Conn., investment management firm, in their latestappraisal of the outlook.   ``A further easing of inflation pressures and lower interestrates appear to be reasonable expectations for the months ahead.''   That looks like a recipe for higher bond prices, at least amongtop-quality securities such as Treasury bonds. But opinions remainsharply divided on what it might mean for the stock market.   ``Corporate earnings are forecast to decline,'' Wright said.``We expect that earnings disappointments will increasinglyoverpower the interest rate downtrend as a determinant of stockprices, taking them lower in the process.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Nov. 25-26</NOTE></DOC>
