The world's largest oil company said it expects the sale, to a buyout group that includes Reliance management, to result in an after-tax gain of more than $275 million. Exxon said it plans to reach a definitive agreement on the sale by the end of the month, before the new tax law takes effect, but said it isn't sure whether all of the expected gain will be booked in the fourth quarter.    Cleveland-based Reliance, although profitable in recent years, proved a huge misstep for Exxon. &quot;It's been their albatross,&quot; says William L. Randol, oil analyst at First Boston Corp. A principal reason Exxon bought the unit for $1.2 billion in 1979 was to help develop a device on which Exxon held a patent and that the company believed would dramatically enhance the energy efficiency of electric motors. Exxon made much of its discovery, heralding it as a possible solution to the energy crisis. But Exxon's device later proved unsuitable to the commercial market.    Exxon said its expected gain in excess of $275 million will be an &quot;after-tax book profit, based on generally accepted accounting principles, and escalated for inflation.&quot; An Exxon spokesman declined to discuss specific figures, as did other parties to the transaction.    Some analysts expressed surprise that Exxon estimated that the gain would exceed the difference between the sale price and what it paid for Reliance. Exxon declined to indicate the book value of Reliance but a spokesman said, &quot;We have written off assets and have done some restructuring in Reliance.&quot;    After Exxon's announcement its common stock fell 75 cents to $69.75 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    But Mr. Randol of First Boston viewed the sale positively. &quot;They're fortunate to get as hefty a price tag as they did,&quot; the analyst said. Sanford Margoshes, senior vice president of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., also applauded the sale. Mr. Margoshes argued that Exxon could get much better returns by investing the money in its oil and gas businesses. He said Exxon has had the highest returns on investment in the industry, averaging 16.8% last year. The returns from Reliance, he said, have been much lower.    The planned sale of the maker of electric motors, communications gear and weighing instruments comes amid a massive restructuring by Exxon, following the sharp drop in oil prices. The restructuring has included shrinking Exxon's work force, paring management layers, consolidating subsidiaries and slashing capital spending. Just this week, Exxon and a partner agreed to sell the company's headquarters, located in Rockefeller Center here, to a unit of Tokyo-based Mitsui Real Estate Development Co. for $610 million.    Exxon's announcement also marks yet another oil giant's retreat from a failed diversification move made after the early-1970's boom in oil prices. &quot;Most companies seem to be pulling in their horns and returning to their roots&quot; in oil and gas exploration and development, said Shearson's Mr. Margoshes.    Last year, Exxon exited the office equipment market when it sold the assets of its Exxon Office Systems division to Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co. and Harris Corp. for undisclosed sums. Exxon, which had invested at least $500 million in the venture over 10 years, already had taken a $30 million charge against 1984 earnings when it disclosed that it was selling out.    The Reliance acquisition brought Exxon a number of problems related to Reliance's Federal Pacific Electric Co. unit. Problems with the design of a line of Federal Pacific circuit breakers led to a costly recall. Reliance also was assessed significant cleanup charges related to Federal's use of toxic chemicals, a spokesman said. He declined to provide specific figures on either problem. Reliance sold its Federal Pacific operations earlier this year.    These problems, plus a recession that hit Reliance's heavy industry customers, produced losses of $32 million in 1982 and $33 million in 1983. In 1978, the last full year before Reliance joined Exxon, the company earned $64 million.    Reliance began turning around in 1984, but it was never a major producer for Exxon's bottom line. For 1984 and 1985, Reliance earned a total of $41 million while Exxon earned more than $10 billion. In the first nine months of 1986, Reliance earned $43 million, Exxon said.    Exxon said Reliance generated &quot;substantially positive net cash flow&quot; over the life of the acquisition, above the funds invested by the oil giant. &quot;Exxon took a lot of cash out of the operation,&quot; agreed one source outside of Exxon who participated in the transaction.    Besides the Reliance managers, the buyout group includes Citicorp Capital Investors, a unit of the bank holding company, and Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., the investment banking arm of Prudential Insurance Co. of America. A Prudential-Bache investment banker said Citicorp and Prudential-Bache jointly proposed the buyout to Exxon. Reliance wasn't up for sale before that time, said Bob Willard, who heads PrudentialBache's mergers and acquisitions group.    Exxon said it had received several unsolicited expressions of interest in the unit in recent years, but declined to say whether there were other active suitors when the buyout involving Reliance management was proposed.    Mr. Willard said the buyout partners haven't decided how the transaction will be structured, although he acknowledged that such transactions are often financed through high-risk, high-yield securities, often called &quot;junk bonds.&quot; Also undecided, said Mr. Willard, is the number of Reliance executives who will participate in the buyout group.    Industry analysts said Reliance's telecommunications businesses, which make equipment for telephone companies and others, have particularly strong potential. Reliance also makes electric motors and mechanical drives for a variety of industrial and consumer uses and weighing devices through its Toledo Scale subsidiary. The 82-year-old company has 21,000 employees.    John Morley, Reliance's president and chief executive since 1981, will remain with Reliance. Mr. Morley originally came to Reliance from Exxon; the future of the less than 10 other Exxon managers working at Reliance will be discussed in the coming weeks, a Reliance spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
