Food prices were modestly higher.   If the April increase held for 12 straight months, inflation atthe wholesale level would register an annual increase of 4.6percent, more than double the 2.2 percent 1987 wholesale price rise.   The April increase, coming after a 0.6 percent gain in March,the sharpest rise in almost a year, seems certain to add toconcerns that inflation is reheating.   In an effort to cool off the economy, the Federal Reserve hasrecently moved to make cash less readily available to the nation'sbanking system. That credit tightening prompted the nation's majorbanks on Wednesday to boost their prime lending rate from 8.5percent to 9 percent as concern spread that inflation is now agreater threat than recession.   Energy prices, which had posted sharp declines from Septemberthrough February, recorded a 3.1 percent surge, dramaticallyhigher, even, than the 0.9 percent jump of March.   Such prices, which Labor Department analysts said accounted forhalf of the rise in the overall index, have not jumped so steeplysince January 1987.   The energy price surge was widespread, with the cost of gasolineup 0.7 percent, the price of home heating oil up 5.2 percent andthe cost of natural gas up 4.3 percent.   Analysts, noting that crude oil prices are on the upswing, saymotorists can expect further rises in gasoline prices. Thewholesale price of gasoline rose 1.5 percent in March, the firstgain since August.   As for food, gains were posted for pork (1.7 percent), chicken(4.7 percent), vegetables (2.1 percent) and coffee (2.1 percent).These rises were offset, however, by sharp declines in the pricesof eggs (16.3 percent), fruit (4.4 percent), fish (2.6 percent) andbeef (0.1 percent).   Overall, food prices at wholesale were up 0.4 percent, abouthalf of the 0.7 percent increase of the previous month.   The index of wholesale prices minus food and energy was up atiny 0.1 percent after a 0.4 percent increase in March. Thisslowdown was likely to be viewed as good news as economists believethis calculation is a more accurate reflection of underlyinginflationary pressures.   Part of the reason for the April slowdown in this calculationwas a 0.5 percent drop in new car prices, a big turnaround from a1.0 percent increase in March.   In releasing its Producer Price Index for goods one step shortof the retail level, the Labor Department gave these additionaldetails on April activity:   _Capital equipment costs were up a moderate 0.2 percent, halfthe increase of the previous month.   _Children's clothing prices gained 0.6 percent while men'sclothing costs gained 0.1 percent, the same as the gain recordedfor women's apparel.   For the first four months of 1988, wholesale prices have risenat an annual rate of 2.9 percent.   The wholesale price index has been showing more restraint thanthe companion consumer price index, in part because the consumerindex charts two areas of considerable recent inflation _ servicesand imported goods. These sectors are not tracked in the wholesaleprice calculation.   The Consumer Price Index rose 4.4 percent in 1987 and was up 0.5percent in March. The CPI figures for April will be released nextweek.   The April increase brought the overall wholesale price index to106.9. This means that a selection of wholesale goods costing $100during a 1982 base period would have cost $106.90 last month. Thisindex itself is not adjusted for seasonal variations, as are otherfigures in the report.</TEXT></DOC>
