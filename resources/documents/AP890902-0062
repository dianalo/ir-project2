The bomb exploded in a truck parked outside El Espectador, thesecond-largest daily in Colombia. Its editor was assassinated bydrug traffickers three years ago.   There were no claim of responsibility for today's bombing. Butdrug lords recently launched a campaign of bombings andassasinations in a bid to force Colombia to reverse a decision toextradite suspects to the United States.   The Bogota radio station RCN quoted the Red Cross as saying oneperson died. RCN and the Caracol radio station said 12 to 38 peoplewere injured, including three in the newspaper plant and others whowere in buses passing by.   The bombing occurred as Colombia awaited the arrival Sunday ofU.S. military aid. A well-placed source at the Defense Ministry saida U.S. advance team of eight _ one officer and seven enlisted men _already was in Colombia.   The team is ``doing nothing more than setting up a mobilecommunications unit to coordinate the arrival of the militaryequipment,'' said the source, who is working with the U.S. advisers.   He denied reports that U.S. military aid already had arrived inColombia.   Today's explosion shortly before 7 a.m. was heard 18 miles awayin this capital city of 6 million. The bomb was in a truck that hadbeen left in a gasoline station next to the newspaper's two-storybrick building, radio reports quoted witnesses as saying.   Seven cars parked inside El Espectador's property were heavilydamaged or destroyed, the radio reports said. Windows of thebuilding were shattered. The newspaper's plant is just south ofBogota's downtown business district.   On Dec. 17, 1985, El Espectador's editor, Guillermo Cano, wasassassinated by men firing submachine guns as he left in his carfrom the newspaper.   El Espectador is one of the most respected newspapers in LatinAmerica for its staunch opposition to government corruption andhuman rights violations. The newspaper had been publishing storiescalling for stronger action against drug traffickers.   On Friday, Colombia's defense minister said foreign troops werenot needed to fight the war against drug lords.   ``We can face this challenge alone'' Gen. Oscar Botero said.   He said 100 police officers were sent to Medellin, home of theworld's most powerful cocaine cartel, to strengthen the 4,000-memberpolice garrison there. Drug lords based there are believedresponsible for 80 percent of the cocaine that is smuggled into theUnited States.   Botero said the army already has sent a special elite unit and ananti-guerrilla battalion to the city, where authorities said policedefused a 40-pound bomb left at a bank Friday by terror squadsworking for drug lords.   A high-ranking U.S. drug official who spoke on condition ofanonymity told American reporters in Bogota that Colombia's 12 topdrug lords may be hiding in Colombia and perhaps have bribedsecurity forces to protect them. All are wanted in the United States.   The official said drug cartels may have people stationed in smalltowns watching for military or police movement. Army colonels canmake up to $15,000 monthly working for drug dealers, he said.   ``There is no doubt in my mind there will be a great deal ofbloodshed,'' he said of the future of the government crackdown.   The Pentagon said Friday that as part of a $65 million packageapproved by President Bush, it will give Colombia two C-130transport planes, five UH-1H combat helicopters and eight A-37 jets.The equipment could start arriving by Sunday, officials said.   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said that up to 200 Americanmilitary personnel could accompany the U.S. supplies for assignmentsranging from ``unloading to training.''   President Virgilio Barco has said he welcomes the U.S. militaryequipment and Colombia's justice minister, Monica de Greiff, said inWashington this week that the country could use an additional $19million in equipment.   The government began its crackdown on drug lords after theykilled the leading presidential candidate and the top policeofficial in Medellin Aug. 18.   Gen. Botero said that under special emergency measures,authorities already had searched 2,004 properties believed linked totraffickers and seized 550 ranches, villas and estates; 1,356 cars;1,061 weapons; 349 airplanes; 142 motorcycles; and 33 yachts.</TEXT></DOC>
