But the truly loopy element isthat $5,000 credit for first-time home purchasers. Wanna betit has the clearest sailing through Congress?   Figure this one out:</LP><TEXT>   1) It's aimed at inducing a burst of consumer confidence.But people are just now tiptoeing back into the fast-foodjoints. Maybe a 30-year mortgage is starting a little high upthe purchase ladder.   2) For people who think they'll keep their jobs,entry-level homes already are unusually affordable. Most ofthese folks can and will buy anyway. If anything, theirproblem is a down payment, and a credit a year or two fromnow (there's a $2,500 annual maximum) won't help. Meanwhile,the more nervous won't buy, even to get five grand. And ifsomehow everybody did decide to take the plunge, the supplyat the bottom end is so limited that prices would rise, maybeby the $5,000.   3) In the two most distressed parts of the country,California and the Northeast, housing prices are the highestand therefore $5,000 is least likely to matter.   4) Why do we necessarily want more people to cease rentingright now anyway? Apartment vacancies are still high inseveral markets, and besides, a home buyer is likely to haveless disposable income with which to buy goods and servicesthat will put marginal labor to work. OK, you'll get someconstruction jobs, but if that's the aim, why not take ashort cut and guarantee loans to builders? (Forget you readthat])   5) You know who really gains by churning real-estatetransactions? All the people who take a piece out of nearlyevery one of them: the broker/agents, the escrow officers,the appraisers, the inspectors, the mortgage peddlers. Manyof them are busy enough as is with refinancings. According tothe Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in this sector hasrisen 50% faster than the overall work force since 1980. Howare we better off? Attention, liberals: In case theWashington Post overlooked it, blacks and Hispanics combinedhold only 7% of the jobs in this field.   The case for boosting real estate is stronger than usualat present because depressed values are such a drag onfinancial institutions, which in response have tightened thestrings on the rest of the economy. But home tracts aren'tthe bulk of property besetting the balance sheets, so why&quot;spend&quot; an estimated $5 billion in credits on this segment?   Patchwork: Apologies to Angelo Mozilo, the outspoken chiefexecutive at Countrywide Credit Industries, whose first nameI botched when his views on tax policy were quoted here Jan.21. More important to Mr. Mozilo, George Bush seems to havefollowed much of his advice.   ---   A lot more manure will be spread in Washington before theyear is old, but unfortunately none of it will be useful ingrowing crops. And on that routinely fecund front, we'rebeginning to harvest disappointment.   Keith C. Barrons is a stickler for numbers. He's aresearch biologist who for the past several years has beenindependently analyzing agriculture. The story of thatoh-so-basic industry heretofore has been -- unless youbelieve the apocalyptics -- one of blessed progress. We canbe confident of that because, aside from paeans to the&quot;family farmer,&quot; when was the last time you heard a referenceto croplands in the State of the Union?   Anyway, Mr. Barrons, whose earlier book &quot;The Food in YourFuture&quot; was an &quot;anatomy of abundance,&quot; is not so sanguine ina forthcoming volume. As a preview, he sends along the latestyield data from the USDA. They show that 1991 was the latestin at least six years of flat peracre output. In other words,the great postWorld War II gains -- nearly four times in cornand potatoes, double in wheat and soybeans -- have peteredout.   Mr. Barrons, who's rather a Malthusian despite hisappreciation for the potential of science, sees this assimply the law of diminishing returns at work. Heacknowledges that genetic engineering promises additionallittle leaps, but says that the finiteness of the sun'senergy and the planet's moisture means that the best gainsare behind us.   This leads him to consider a nation that no longer cansafely expect fewer and fewer tillers of the soil to fillmore and more bellies at home and still have leftovers forunlimited hunger abroad. His latest title is &quot;A Catastrophein the Making.&quot; He'd better watch out or Lester Brown willrun excerpts in the spiffy magazine that his World Watch hasbecome since he got that MacArthur grant.   Don't worry, famine isn't on the West's doorstep. In fact,there's considerable room for higher production in the ThirdWorld, where property rights and market prices are virtuallyuntapped resources. And technology may produce a new diet.Yet a ceiling on America's bounty certainly would mean a NewWorld Order.   Sidelight: The maturing of the agricultural miracle wascalled to my attention nearly a year ago by a fellow inOklahoma who claimed that &quot;innovative technologies&quot; like hisown held out hope of renewed revolutionary gains. But, hecomplained, the U.S. economy since the 1970s had been suckeddry of the wherewithal to commercialize bold ideas;corporations only devised on the margins. Dubious andignorant of his brainstorm, I nevertheless suspect there'ssomething to the beef about parched genius. The U.S. might bebetter off watering a few wild seeds than building the nextrow of houses on Shady Lane.   ---   One thing that still grows is the number of lawyers. I seethe bar and Dan Quayle are having at it again. Well, herewithis a little road map for businesspeople: state ratios ofattorneys in private practice to the potential &quot;client base.&quot;Down is up in this ranking, you might say.
