Mortgage rates, particularly on conventional fixed-rate loans,have declined steadily in recent weeks as market interest ratesdropped amid continued signs the economy and inflation are cooling.   In the past month, more and more lenders have dropped their30-year conventional mortgage rates to below 10 percent for thefirst time in about 16 months.   HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J.-based mortgage reserach firm, said10.5 percent of the 2,000 mortgage lenders surveyed last weekdropped their fixed rates to 9 percent to 9.9 percent, compared withabout two dozen at the end of May.   The national average for 30-year loans was 10.3 percent, whilethe average for one-year ARMs was 9 percent, the survey said.   Some lenders say the drop in interest rates has helped spurinterest in new and existing homes lately.   The National Association of Realtors reported Monday thatexisting home sales fell 5.6 percent to their lowest level in 16months. However, some experts predicted the pace would pick up thissummer as the full impact of the rate drop was felt.   Right now, ARM holders with rates in the 11 percent to 14 percentrange have become the first to cash in on the rate decline byrushing to lock in lower, fixed rates, industry experts said.   ARMs are adjusted up or down at specified intervals to reflectprevailing interest rates, usually one-year Treasury bills. In manycases, ARM rates may be raised by up to 2 percentage points a year,or 6 percentage points over the life of the loan.   For someone who received a $100,000 ARM three years ago with a7.5 percent rate the first year of the loan, monthly payments wouldtotal $902.78. But payments could rise to $1,361.11 a month thisyear, if the rate rose to the maximum 13.5 percent.   Experts say homeowners should consider refinancing if prevailingmarket rates fall at least two percentage points below theirmortgage rate. Otherwise, with closing costs running anywhere from 3to 5 percentage points of the refinanced loan, it may not be worthit, they said.   The rush to refinance appears to be spotty, according to experts.   Fred Koons, chairman of Chase Manhattan Corp.'s home mortgagedivision, said he's seen a sharp increase in refinancings inCalifornia, where ARMs are particularly popular. He said half of thecurrent mortgage applications there were for refinancings.   But Ronnie J. Wynn, president of Colonial Mortgage Co. ofMontgomery, Ala., said refinancings made up only 1.5 percent ofoutstanding mortgages, compared with 40 percent in 1986 and 1987,when interest rates were significantly lower.   ``Refinancings are up a little bit but most of the people who hadinterest rates of 12 percent or above, where it would be worthwhileto refinance, refinanced in '86 or '87,'' Wynn said. ``I do thinkwe'll see them (refinancings) pick up as interest rates fall.''   For homeowners with ARMs that started out with low interest ratesthe first year but headed higher each year as overall interest ratesrose, refinanicng means more than securing a steady rate.   ``It's brought peace of mind for some people,'' said Mozilo ofCountrywide, where 10 percent of the $800 million are loanapplications are for refinancings. ``Many people were very naive tothe consequences of these adjustable rate mortgages. Of course, manypeople also couldn't qualify to buy a home without ARMs.''</TEXT></DOC>
