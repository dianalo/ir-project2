Perhaps because author Robert Kuttner, aneconomics columnist for Business Week and the New Republic,has been cogitating for so many years, his book bears few ofthe slapdash, tendentious markings so common to the genre.   Mr. Kuttner's intellectual candor and vigorous literarypitch are above reproach. This is not to suggest that he isremotely persuasive in his prescriptions, though it entitleshim to a fair hearing.</LP><TEXT>   The book deconstructs splendidly the incoherencies andhypocrisies embedded in U.S. trade policies. For the past 45years, U.S. officials have preached the virtues of anunfettered market as a global ideal. But in practice, theU.S. underwrote Japan's single-minded mercantilism, andWestern Europe's flabby welfare statism, to keep intact theanti-Soviet political and security alliance.   Mr. Kuttner finds that this stance made less sense overtime, as the U.S. economy fell into relative decline and theSoviet threat ebbed. He hits a nerve describing tenderfootedefforts by the U.S. free trade caucus to convert officialJapan to its way of thinking.   At home, U.S. policy has been a crazy quilt of free tradeand the policy that dare not speak its name, protectionism.The latter encompassed farm price supports, quotas on steeland textile imports and a halfhearted military-led industrialpolicy.   At the same time, the Pentagon's byzantine controls onhigh-tech exports with putative military uses amounted to akind of mercantilism-in-reverse. Mr. Kuttner reports that onebattle royal between the Pentagon and the Commerce Departmentcentered on whether recreational scubadiving gear could beexported to an unfriendly country. In another curiousinstance, Israel was precluded from buying U.S.-madesupercomputers.   From this, Mr. Kuttner adduces the following (and repeatsit mantra-like): Since government intervention is ubiquitousin economies the world over, the U.S. ought to drop its&quot;utopian&quot; laissez-faire pretenses and manage its tradepolicies in a more thorough and sustained manner. But this islike sending someone with a cold out to catch pneumonia.   However overworked, the summons here to a &quot;newnationalism&quot; is certainly apropos for the world's solesuperpower. Yet what sort of quirky &quot;nationalism&quot; would havethe U.S. surrender its bedrock, if unevenly plied, principlesjust as the much of the world is modernizing anddemocratizing the American way?   Accepting Mr. Kuttner's suppositions, it seems to followthat as the imperatives of military alliance wane, the U.S.is better positioned than ever to negotiate liberalized tradeabroad. In turn, this should ease domestic protectionistpressures. Why, even our unwieldy military-industrial complexis being disentangled. Call it the &quot;end of statism.&quot;   Mr. Kuttner just can't seem to get with the program. Asbefits the editor of a journal called the American Prospect,his alternative is as much social and political as it iseconomic. It's also hopelessly passe. He's foraging throughthe rubble of the Berlin Wall for remnants of the fabled&quot;mixed economy.&quot;   As an admirer of John Maynard Keynes once remarked abouthis protectionist sympathies, this &quot;aberration of a noblemind&quot; could be overlooked were it not for Mr. Kuttner'sfollowing among Democratic politicians, advisers andpublicists. Should they be itching to shed the Spenglerianslogans of the Kennedy boys, Teddy and Paul, they will findno relief in this hidebound volume.   Two bloopers leap out. Mr. Kuttner charges that theReaganites poured money down a high-tech military rat hole atthe &quot;expense of commercial vigor.&quot; Surely the ability of theU.S. to protect Persian Gulf oil proves that a strong economydepends on a strong military. Hand-wringing about the dreadtrade deficit is unbound by soaring U.S. exports, the legacyof the 1980s' free-wheeling competitive ethic (though thetrend may be reversed by George Bush's old-boy clampdown).   Mr. Kuttner especially objects to the newish notion of the&quot;global economy.&quot; The gathering force of private markets, yousee, frustrates his wish to deploy government bureaucrats toshield &quot;key industries&quot; with import controls, subsidies andshackles on foreign investment. (Lest this sound too macho,the author proposes forking over U.S. monetary policy to a&quot;true world central bank&quot;).   In our loopy political lexicon, Mr. Kuttner is generallyconsidered a &quot;liberal&quot; economist. Yet time and again heweighs in against liberalization and for regulation andredistributionism. The only wrinkle in the fabric is thewholesale lifting of Pentagon controls on exports --including, one presumes, for future Saddams.   This appears to gainsay the book's taut Marxo-Keynesianlogic. But it is of a piece with Mr. Kuttner's crimpedconception of an America with no duties or ideologicalambitions beyond its borders: a hybrid of Sweden and Japan,with the frayed social contract of the former and thepredatory monopolies of the latter. As the Swedes andJapanese have discerned, this is a grim prospect indeed.   ---   Mr. Brock is an Olin Fellow at the Heritage Foundation.</TEXT></DOC>
