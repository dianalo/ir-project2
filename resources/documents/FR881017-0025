Grounds for the Petition,'' removethe first two sentences and insert the following sentences in their place:The petitioner states that not following technical specifications in anemergency could lead to an accident similar to the one at Three Mile Island,Unit 2. The petitioner states that Federal Regulations require a nuclearplant safety system to pump water into a nucler reactor as long as theabnormal condition which activated the system persists; but, that CommonwealthEdison's Policy permits operators to turn off water being pumped into anuclear reactor during an emergency before the safety system has finishedits job. The petitioner notes that turing off water being pumped into anuclear reactor during an emergency can cause a nuclear fuel meltdown,release of highly radioactive fission products, and exposure of plant personneland people nearby to hazardous radiation. The petitioner offers that duringa Proceeding before the Illinois Commerce Commission on September 15, 1987,Commonwealth Edison's attorney cited 10 CFR 50.54, paragraphs (x) and (y)as authority for their policy. The petitioner states that this policy appliesto all of Commonwealth Edision's nuclear power plants; therefore, the petitionerconcludes that Commonwealth Edison risks an accident such as the accidentat Three Mile Island Unit 2 at twelve nuclear power plants.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 11th day of October 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Samuel J.
