The Office of Civilian RadioactiveWaste Management (OCRWM) was established within the United States Departmentof Energy (DOE) to carry out the mandates of the Act. The culminationof activities leading to the first deep, geological repository and themonitored retrievable storage (MRS) facility will prepare the DOE toaccept spent fuel for storage and disposal by 1998. The following majorgoals are expected to be completed during the 1990s for the waste managementsystem: (1) site characterization and selection of a first repositorysite from three candidates; (2) waste package design and testing; (3)repository design, regulatory authorization and construction; (4) siting,design and construction of an MRS facility if approved by Congress; (5)preparation of transport casks and a transportation fleet; and (6) industryuse of interim dry surface storage or at-reactor rod consolidation toalleviate special storage needs for spent fuel. The Act also authorizedsiting, but not construction, of a second repository. On 28 May 1986,the Secretary of Energy announced that site specific activities for asecond repository would be postponed indefinitely on the basis of newprojections reflecting reduced amounts of spent fuel and other factors;however, development of generic technology will be continuing in the1990s to support both the first and second repositories. An overviewof the strategy, goals, objectives and achievements to be anticipatedin the 1990s for the DOE's Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Programare provided. The issues and policies to be considered in the 1990s aredescribed.</TEXT></DOC>
