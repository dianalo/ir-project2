The far field power distribution of the fiber output andthe total light scatter were both shown to vary with fiber length. Theresults support a model that postulates the presence of large scale scatterersin the fiber which cause diffusion of power between guided rays untila steady state is achieved. 19 references.</TEXT></DOC>
