In the adaptive monitory model,the three-dimensional solutions are permanently adapted to incore probedata. The corrections resulting from the adaptive process lead to reliablepredictions of future reactor states. The corrections can also be carriedforward to future operating cycles. This can shorten the time requiredto introduce an validate new design and operating strategy improvements.</TEXT></DOC>
