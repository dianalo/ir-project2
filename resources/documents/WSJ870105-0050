Under the proposal, widely described as an attempt to &quot;decouple&quot; agricultural subsidies from grain production, growers of subsidized crops like wheat, corn and cotton would be given income-protection payments based on their historical harvest totals. A wheat grower, for instance, could continue raising wheat, but wouldn't be paid more than he would get for his total 1985 bushels; or, he could decide to idle his whole farm, seeding only grass or planting trees.    But the farmer wouldn't be allowed to plant some other crop -- either another government-subsidized crop like corn or cotton, or any unsubsidized crop like potatoes or dry beans. The Agriculture Department, mindful of the uproar that would emerge from potato, bean and other farmers, insisted on barring any alternative crops.    The White House budget office wanted to allow farmers to grow any crop they wanted, but department officials said Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng successfully urged President Reagan to propose barring farmers who get the new payments from planting other crops. While curbing incentives to overproduce subsidized grains, &quot;one has to avoid commensurate&quot; competitive impact on potato and other farmers who aren't federally subsidized, a department official said.    Originally, a provision of the five-year 1985 farm law allowed grain growers to receive subsidies while idling half their land, and permitted them to plant potatoes, beans and other non-subsidized crops on idled acreage. The provision allowed the farmers to collect 92% of what their income subsidies would be under full production.    But longtime potato and bean farmers raised such a fuss that Congress early in 1986 changed the legislation to prevent planting of any such alternative crops.    Allowing a switch to other crops, even hay, would defeat the purpose of discouraging excess production, department officials said. &quot;You then move into the barnyard of another farmer,&quot; who mightn't have been subsidized, one official said, &quot;and pretty quickly they all become program crops,&quot; requiring subsidies because of heightened competition.    The proposal isn't related to another program, started under the 1985 farm act, that pays farmers to idle highly erodible land and instead place it into a long-term conservation reserve. Growers could qualify for either the conservation program or the new plan, but not both, officials said.    The &quot;decoupling&quot; plan is part of expected administration proposals aimed at controlling agriculture spending. Huge surpluses drove crop subsidies to a record $25.6 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, up from about $18 billion the year before. Administration budget analysts figure that spending in fiscal 1987 will be about $25.3 billion, easing to $21.3 billion in fiscal 1988.    But if Congress adopts the new administration proposals, officials estimate farm spending could be cut to about $10.5 billion by fiscal 1992.    There's considerable support in Congress for separating income subsidies from crop production. That move would generally maintain federal farm assistance while reducing the incentive for producing excess harvests that boost income subsidies and require the government to take over huge and costly grain surpluses.    Other parts of the expected administration plan are certain to run into more opposition on Capitol Hill. One provision could lower the &quot;target prices&quot; used as a basis for figuring income subsidies by 10% a year starting in 1988. The cuts would be in addition to reductions of 2%, 3% and 5%, respectively, mandated by the 1985 law for 1988, 1989 and 1990 programs, after freezing target-price levels in 1986 and 1987.    Another proposal would broaden the application of the general $50,000 limitation on per-farm income-subsidy payments to include farm assistance that currently escapes that ceiling when federal crop loans that support market prices are sharply trimmed.    The &quot;cap&quot; might be applied, for instance, to certain payments under a &quot;marketing loan&quot; program created by the 1985 law for cotton and rice growers. The program gives them income assistance to cushion the effect of drastically reduced prices. The price cuts were spurred by the law as a way to make those farmers competitive in world markets. </TEXT></DOC>
