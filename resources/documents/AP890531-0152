The two sides also have conducted a combined 340 inspections toverify the missile destruction and ensure compliance with otherterms of the treaty.   ``The past year has been marked by almost continual eliminationof missiles, launchers and related equipment as both sides seek toimplement the primary aim of the INF Treaty,'' Pentagon officialssaid in a statement.   ``Since the first Soviet SS-20 missile destruction at KapustinYar in August, (U.S.) inspectors have witnessed the elimination of945 Soviet missiles. Beginning with the Sept. 8 elimination atLonghorn Army Ammunition Plant near Marshall, Texas, Sovietinspectors have been present for the destruction of 324 U.S. INFmissiles.''   The treaty took effect on June 1, 1988, and calls for thedestruction of all intermediate-range nuclear missiles over athree-year period. Those missiles have a range of roughly 300 milesto 3,500 miles, and the agreement to destroy them marked the firsttime the two superpowers had agreed to eliminate an entire class ofnuclear weapons.   The agreement also marked the first time the United States andSoviet Union ever agreed to on-site, or ``intrusive,'' inspectionsto ensure compliance with an arms treaty.   When the treaty took effect, the Soviets had 1,846 missiles inthe intermediate-range category, divided among six different types.The United States had 846 missiles, divided between Pershing andground-launched cruise missiles.   According to the yearend statistics, which were compiled by theDefense Department's On-Site Inspection Agency, both sidesexercised their right to conduct 20 surprise inspections during thefirst year, in addition to the normal inspections to witnessdestruction of missiles and to verify the final closure of INFmissile facilities.   The Soviets conducted 96 inspections during the year in WesternEurope and the United States, compared to 244 conducted by Americaninspectors at Soviet sites.   Both sides also succeeded during the first year in moving aninspection team from the other country into permanent housingfacilities near missile plants. The treaty specifies that up to 30inspectors may be located full-time outside the gates of a missileproduction plant to guard against surreptious production of INFmissiles.   In the case of the Soviets, they were provided housingfacilities in West Jordan, Utah, on April 17, near a Hercules plantat Magna, Utah. American inspectors moved into permanent housing inVotkinsk, near a missile plant, on April 10.</TEXT></DOC>
