Spokesman Milt Capps confirmed that one-person bureaus in GrandRapids, Mich.; Bismarck N.D.; Syracuse, N.Y. and Santa Fe, N.M.were being closed, as were offices in Montana and Wyoming.   Capps denied, however, what he said was the ``erroneousimpression that we are doing anything but increasing our coveragein these states.''   He said UPI would rely more on stringer networks and its jointventure partners, which include TV's Financial News Network, StatesNews Service and Financial World Magazine.   Asked if other bureaus had been closed, Capps said, ``I have nofurther announcements.'' He declined to give details on futureclosures or how many bureaus UPI now operates in the United States,but said ``a change up and down in staffing will be continuing forseveral months.''   Last month he confirmed a Washington Post report that 31 UPIreporters and editors were being laid off.   He said UPI was realigning staff throughout the organizationthis summer and fall with a shift toward specific fields such asbusiness and finance and sports.   ``The upshot is that virtually every bureau in the systemworldwide is affected either by increases or decreases.''   ``We are developing what we think is a new role for UPI after 83years which entails not only strong general news service butincreased emphasis on focused news reports that can command apremium in the market place, including media and corporatesubscribers,'' he said.   ``The bottom line is we can now say we have more people writingfor UPI across the board than a year ago,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
