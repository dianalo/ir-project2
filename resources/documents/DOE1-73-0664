Each bay has a well slot and a manifold slot. The verticaland horizontal members of the framework define, within each productionbay, space above each well slot for a tree module, space above each manifoldslot for a manifold module, and space above the modules for a productionbridge module linking the other modules.</TEXT></DOC>
