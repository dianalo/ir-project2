<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-42-0551 </DOCNO><TEXT>The behavior of pulsed laser-induced &quot;explosively&quot; propagating buriedmolten layers (BL) in ion implantation-amorphized silicon has been studiedin a time- and spatially-resolved way, using nanosecond time-resolvedreflectivity measurements, &quot;Z-contrast&quot; scanning transmission electronmicroscope (STEM) imaging of implanted Cu ions transported by the BL,and helium ion backscattering measurements. Infrared (1152 nm) reflectivitymeasurements allow the initial formation and subsequent motion of theBL to be followed continuously in time. The BL velocity is found to bea function of both its depth below the surface and of the incident KrFlaser energy density (E/sub iota/); a maximum velocity of about 14 m/sis observed, implying an undercooling-velocity relationship of about14 K/(m/s). Z-contrast STEM measurements show that the final BL thicknessis less than 15 nm. Time-resolved optical, TEM and ion backscatteringmeasurements of the final BL depth, as a function of E/sub iota/, arealso found to be in excellent agreement with one another.</TEXT></DOC>
