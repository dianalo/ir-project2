Themodels had already been established in the literature and were inducedby injections of alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, withdrawal from chronicamphetamine, or stress. We verified that exploratory behaviors were depressedin each model and that an antidepressant drug, tranylcypromine, preventedthe depressed behavior in each model. 2DG studies revealed that the rateof regional glucose metabolism was elevated bilaterally in the lateralhabenula of each of the 3 models. Regional metabolic rates were reducedin each model in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, anterior ventralnucleus of the thalamus, and inferior colliculus. Forebrain global metabolicrates were also reduced in each of the models. Tranylcypromine preventedthe elevated rate of lateral habenula metabolism seen in each of themodels alone but did not significantly affect the rates of global metabolism.Our findings of identical metabolic changes in each of the models indicatethat these changes are not idiosyncratic to a particular model; rather,they correlate with a generalizable state of depressed exploratory behaviorin rats.</TEXT></DOC>
