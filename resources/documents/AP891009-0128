Protesters also held a vigil in East Berlin to demand democraticreforms after a weekend of demonstrations across this hard-lineCommunist nation.   On Saturday and Sunday, clashes broke out between police anddemonstrators with hundreds arrested, several injuries, and onedeath reported by news organizations and witnesses. The governmenthas issued no official toll.   Christoph Wonneberger, pastor for the Lukas Lutheran Church inLeipzig, said ``at least'' 70,000 demonstrators marched in Leipzigon Monday night.   Wonneberger said he was surprised by the restraint of police andparamilitary troops who were deployed nearby.   ``Even though this demonstration is the largest (since 1953), toour knowledge it went off completely without violence,'' he said ina telephone interview with West Germany's ZDF television network.   In 1953, Soviet forces crushed a workers' uprising.   Some Leipzig demonstrators even ``began conversations withparamilitary troops'' after the crowd started dispersing bymid-evening, Wonneberger said.   He said, ``I consider this (police restraint) a very hopefulsign following the violence'' in earlier demonstrations.   Police clubbed pro-democracy protesters in six East Germancities over the weekend and an opposition leader said that unlessthe government eases its policies, violence may increase.   Before the Leipzig march, officials of the Leipzig CommunistParty promised publicly they would push for an open dialoguebetween citizens and the government, church sources said.   In a public statement, the Leipzig party officials said, ``Weall need a free exchange of ideas about how we should continuesocialism in our nation,'' according to the church sources.   The country's communist leadership celebrated East Germany's40th anniversary over the weekend with a visit by Soviet PresidentMikhail Gorbachev and declared it would not change its tough stand.West Germany and other Western countries have also pressed EastGermany in past months to make reforms to stem a wave of refugeesheading to the West.   In Leipzig on Monday, the protesters marched after attending atraditional Monday evening prayer service at St. Nicholas LutheranChurch, witnesses said.   Throngs of people joined them along the way, they said.   Among their slogans, the Leipzig protesters on Monday shouted``Democracy!'' and ``No violence!'' said the witnesses, who spokeon condition of anonymity.   A larger number of police officers did not stop the march butcordoned off the downtown area, the witnesses said. ZDF televisionsaid armored personnel carriers also were seen in the area.   In East Berlin, several thousand demonstrators gathered in frontof the Lutheran Gethsemane Church for the pro-democracy vigil, WestGerman media reported. ``Police have shown restraint so far,''radio and television said.   Earlier Monday, 18 Lutheran Church leaders issued an appeal inEast Berlin calling on East Germany's government to approve broaddemocratic reforms and urging all sides to refrain from violence.   The Rev. Rainer Eppelmann, an opposition leader and Lutheranpastor in East Berlin, said Monday on RIAS radio in West Berlinthat the doctrinaire regime must ``talk with the people about theirwishes and needs'' or violence may rise.   West Germany's ARD television said many of the hundreds arrestedduring the weekend protests already had been sentenced to jailterms of up to six months.   Church sources said a participant in a demonstration last weekwas run over by a train and lost both his legs.   Saechsische Zeitung, a government daily in Dresden, has said aperson was ``seriously injured'' when thousands of people tried toboard freedom trains that passed through Dresden carrying EastGerman refugees from Czechoslovakia to the West.   West Germany's government protested police harassment ofjournalists covering the weekend protests. Police broke severalcameras and ordered some photographers and television crews out ofthe country.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl denounced the East German governmentMonday as ``rigidly authoritarian.''   Up to 15,000 pro-democracy activists held a sit-in Sundayevening in Dresden and thousands of others protested in EastBerlin, Leipzig, Potsdam, Jena, Plauen and Karl-Marx-Stadt over theweekend. Witnesses said police used dogs and clubs to dispersepeaceful demonstrators.   Junge Welt, the Communist Party youth newspaper, said the ``gangof Western news reporters'' stirred up the protests.   Tens of thousands of East Germans have fled to West Germany inrecent weeks in the largest exodus since the Berlin Wall was builtin 1961. Many of those remaining hope Gorbachev will persuade theirgovernment to undertake political and economic reforms.   Including legal emigrants, more than 100,000 East Germans havegone to the West this year. Mary Alice Dorrance Malone, $660, Coatesville,inheritance(Campbell Soup), 39.
