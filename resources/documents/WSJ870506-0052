Denny Smith (R., Ore.) drafted &quot;An Airline Passenger's Bill of Rights.&quot; Among other things, the measure would require airlines to publish delay and lost-baggage statistics on ticket jackets, and provide air travelers with complaint forms pre-addressed to the secretary of transportation. A lengthy flight delay at Washington National Airport prompted Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.) to introduce legislation that would require airlines to post their on-time performance.    Such legislation will do little to improve air travel, but that isn't the point. What Rep. Smith and Sen. Danforth are saying is that they and their frequent-flying colleagues in Congress are no less frustrated with air-travel delays than other Americans. But, then, while most air travelers can do little more to vent their frustration than dash off terse notes to the airlines, Congress can actually address air-traffic problems.    The present air-traffic system is badly overtaxed. Airports are congested and much in need of expanded capacity. The air-traffic-control system is outdated. Many airport control towers are equipped with computers no more sophisticated than the average home computer, with limited traffic-handling capacity.    The shortcomings of the air-traffic system would be understandable if attributable to a funding shortage. But the trust fund set up by Congress for developing airports and air-traffic control, which is derived from passenger user fees, has run a surplus each year since 1982. By the end of this fiscal year, the surplus will be up to $5.6 billion. Some of this may simply reflect normal delays between contracting and dispersals, but the airline industry says Congress is holding up funds to make the federal deficit look smaller.    Rather than accept some blame, the industry claims, Congress has found it more convenient to make whipping boys out of the commercial airlines and, to a slightly lesser extent, private and corporate aviation. Implicit in the legislation of Rep. Smith and Sen. Danforth is the threat that airlines may be partially re-regulated if flight delays continue.    In other words, air travelers would be penalized for the slowness of government. When the airline industry was decontrolled in 1978, the airline industry quickly adjusted. To meet the 60% increase in demand over the nine-year period since then, the airlines added hundreds of new destinations and thousands of flights. Last year, the industry accommodated nearly 400 million passengers.    Government agencies are only now beginning to respond to this tremendous surge in demand. It is expanding capacity at some airports by adding runways, upgrading the computer system of the air-traffic-control network, and developing new routing plans to accommodate more planes in busy corridors and speed the traffic flow.    This is a good start but the system is still way behind. At the present rate, it could be a decade before the air-traffic system catches up. For this reason, Congress cannot afford to play games with the aviation trust fund surplus. That's something for the members to think about the next time they wait impatiently for their flights to take off. </TEXT></DOC>
