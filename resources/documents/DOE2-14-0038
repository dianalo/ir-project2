The plugged equipmentthen leads to expensive deratings or complete shutdowns of generatingunits. Rugged electric heating modules have been proven to efficientlymelt the ice bonds and eliminate pluggage caused by freeze-ups. Theseheating modules are engineered to withstand continuous shock loadingand to provide reliable long-term operation.</TEXT></DOC>
