(local areanetwork management) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Danielle, Diane.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Three approaches to local area network (LAN) management, includinga tightly controlled approach, a moderate approach and a veryliberal approach, are discussed.andP;  The strict approach limits theavailability of software and supports only a tightly controlledlist of applications and hardware.andP;  Although such LANs requirefewer support personnel and tend to run smoother.andP;  The moremoderate approach allows a wider range of hardware and softwarebut, as a consequence, requires more support personnel and runs alittle less smoothly.andP;  The liberal approach allows users to employwhatever hardware and software they want.andP;  However, this approachrequires the most support personnel and runs the least smoothly.andO;Managing a network requires trade-offs between flexibility andsupport.andP;  LAN managers must be prepared to accept them and to maketheir choices clear to the users of the network.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Local Area NetworksNetwork Management.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Last week, I described three LANs: Connie Conservative's tightly controlledenvironment; Lee B. Liberal's anything-goes LAN; and Moe Moderate'smiddle-of-the-road LAN.andP;  This week, we'll look at the support issues thesedesigns raise.andM;Connie runs the tightest ship.andP;  She has a ratio of 400 users to each supportperson.andP;  Her LANs run like clockwork.andP;  When something breaks, it's promptlyfixed.andP;  She never runs over budget and hasn't asked for additional staff intwo years.andM;Connie's users, on the other hand, grumble a lot about not having what theywant.andP;  They don't notice how smoothly everything runs.andM;Lee B. Liberal is always begging for more staff.andP;  He's got one support personfor every 30 users, and his staff is still working 60-hour weeks.andP;  If they'renot fighting fires, they're trying to figure out how to hook up some newmicro or install a new software package or figure out how to do somethingwith one of the packages they already use.andM;Lee's users grumble because his department isn't sufficiently responsive torequests for help.andP;  They never think about how nice it is to be able to putwhatever they want on the LAN.andM;Moe Moderate has a ratio of about one support person to every 75 users.andP;  HisLANs run pretty smoothly, but testing new software or upgrading existingsoftware is cumbersome because of the multiple hardware platforms.andM;Moe's users grumble just like Lee's about his staff not being sufficientlyresponsive when problems occur and, like Connie's, they complain about nothaving this or that software package or computer.andM;Moe tried to compromise once.andP;  When Harriet Hotshot convinced her manager sheabsolutely had to have WhizBang, Moe gave in.andP;  He installed it on the LAN butmade both Harriet and her manager promise in writing it would not hurt LANperformance and they would not ask for or expect help from Moe's staff.andM;Well, the day after it was installed, the LAN laser printer that Harriet usesstarted spewing out reams of paper with funny characters.andP;  Harriet didn'tknow how to set up printer drivers and escape sequences.andM;One day, Harriet's manager came to Moe.andP;  Harriet was in Hawaii, and he had tomake a change in a report in time for a board meeting but didn't know how touse WhizBang.andP;  Could Moe help?andP;  Moe reminded him, gently, of their agreement,but the manager reminded Moe that the report was for the CEO.andP;  Moe's supportstaff was up to its ears in fighting fires, but Moe pulled someone off a fireto help the manager.andP;  The manager never bothered to say thanks.andM;The moral of this tale: You can never satisfy your users, and you are alwaysresponsible.andP;  What you can, and must, do is make a formal decision about thetrade-offs between support requirements and flexibility and make sure yourmanagers understand why you've made this decision.andM;----------Diane Danielle manages an extensive LAN for one of the country's largestbank-holding companies.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
