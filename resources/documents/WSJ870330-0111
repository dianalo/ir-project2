It looks now as if better days may be ahead.    The suggestion that manufacturing fell upon particularly hard times as the 1980s moved along will, of course, produce an argument. Manufacturing companies are a pretty heterogeneous lot, and their fortunes in these years have varied widely. Some obviously have done well. Moreover, the proportion of national employment accounted for by these companies as a whole actually has been drifting irregularly downward since shortly after its World War I peak.    The fact that this declining trend also has been evident in the 1980s is not, therefore, itself any fundamental break with history. We went into the decade with manufacturing accounting for about 22% of gross national product, and the figure was about the same for 1986. The declining trend in the share of the work force employed in manufacturing was about neutralized by improvements in productivity that have been larger in manufacturing than in the rest of the economy. In that sense U.S. manufacturing is not a rust heap sinking into the weeds.    Even so, it is clear that the 1980s have been a painful period for these companies. In order to hold their market position as well as they have, manufacturers were held to price increases less than the rise in their costs; the result was a sharp erosion of profit margins. In the national income accounts the price index for imports during these five years declined almost 10%, and this was a major discipline on prices of domestic products. During the years 1981 to 1986, prices of finished products at the producer level, for example, moved up only 6.5%, and for big-ticket consumer products the five-year price rise was 2.5%. These were all well below the 22% rise in these years for the entire GNP.    Not surprisingly, these limited price increases -- rates that were well below even the moderate pace of inflation since 1980 -- show up in profit margins. During the past five years, profits of corporations outside manufacturing rose almost 50%. Profits of manufacturing companies reflected leaner times as they declined 17%, or about one-third in real terms. (The 78% rise in profits of financial corporations may help to explain why so many nonfinancial firms have felt the call to move into financial-services markets.)    Even with price restraints that cut sharply into profits, U.S. manufacturing companies fought a rear-guard action with international competition. Last year, U.S. exports of manufactured products were well below the volume five years earlier, and a small net export surplus of manufactured products at the beginning of the decade had metamorphosed into imports that exceeded exports by $133 billion -- a large net export deficit.    While it is difficult to make much out of monthly trade figures generated in Washington, there was a little evidence that the closing months of 1986 saw the beginning of some improvement. In any case the fundamentals do point to better days. For one thing, the pressures that forced the dollar's exchange rate to a peak two years ago and put U.S. industry out of the ball game for some international and even some domestic markets have taken a significant turn for the better.    In 1987, the volume of foreign funds required to supplement our meager domestic savings will be substantially less than was needed last year and probably less than was necessary in 1985. Since foreign savings coming here are in the first instance a demand for dollars (in exchange for yen or marks or francs, etc.), a reduced foreign inflow tends to mean a reduction in pressures producing a high exchange rate for the dollar.    The reduced need for foreign savings to balance things out reflects two developments. Personal savings this year should be substantially larger than last year's abnormally small volume. This 1986 aberration is not apt to be repeated in 1987. Moreover, whether Gramm-Rudman-Hollings survives this year's budget strains and pressures may be debatable, but the budget deficit this year will be well below that of fiscal year 1986. Both the administration and the Congressional Budget Office project a drop of more than $45 billion for fiscal 1987.    Even with a moderate rise in private financing requirements -- and it looks as if the 1987 rise will be moderate -- the inflow of funds from abroad to balance out all of this could be $50 billion to $60 billion lower than in 1986. If so, that would be a $50 billion-to-$60 billion smaller foreign demand for dollars -- contributing to a tendency for the dollar's exchange rate to edge downward somewhat further (as it should).    U.S. manufacturers, in short, again are confronting a ball game in which they will be able to play.    Moreover, they have come through the travails of the 1980s with some surprising indications of vitality. In spite of the onethird decline in profits of manufacturing companies (in real terms), they have continued to increase their net stock of productive investment per person employed at the rate of almost 2.5% a year. Thus the average amount of capital employed per worker of about $40,000 by the mid-1980s was roughly in line with the longer-run historical trends.    Of course, there has been a shortage of capital formation for the whole economy, but this has occurred largely outside of manufacturing. There the annual enlargement in the stock of capital per worker has fallen to a pace well below 1%, and the capital augmenting the productiveness of each worker is today about 25% below what trends prevailing up to 15 years ago would have indicated.    Not surprisingly, these differences show up in gains in productivity. Gains for manufacturing industries during this decade have been at the average rate of 3.8% a year, well above the longer-term trend. For many companies the profit pressures have meant not collapse but becoming leaner and meaner.    Outside of manufacturing and agriculture, the performance has been quite different. During the postwar period up to the early-1970s, output per worker increased at an annual rate of 2.1%, and this was about in line with what was happening in the economy generally. Since the early 1970s, however, productivity gains in this part of the economy (which accounts for about 80% of the work force) have been negligible -- about 1% during the past decade.    Productivity patterns are influenced by more than the amount of capital backing up each worker. Indeed, uncertainty about just what does explain these differences invites interest groups to nominate their pet concerns as the probable sources. Thus this deterioration in the productivity performance outside manufacturing is variously ascribed to inadequate improvements in the environment, taxes that discourage effort and earnings, too little research or the poverty of our support for education.    Not surprisingly, these diagnoses seem to have a pattern -- coming respectively from environmentalists, supply-siders, researchers and educationists. Empirical evidence is pretty clear, however, that raising productivity and real incomes does involve using more capital -- that how well off we are is influenced by how much capital supplements workers' efforts.    This is important on its own, but it is also through added machinery and equipment that a good deal of new technology is put to work. And it is manufacturing that has maintained the pace of enlarging the amount of its capital per worker, while the rest of the economy (including government) has fallen behind. (The University of Michigan employs about $80,000 of capital per worker -- suggesting that it requires a lot of capital per worker to produce an idea or to move a mind.)    While manufacturing has been seen as the U.S. economy's black sheep as we have congratulated ourselves on how jobs have been created elsewhere, it is manufacturing that has kept up the pace of those things that deliver rising material levels of living.    Fundamentally, this is good news. A vigorous and viable manufacturing sector is important to the vitality of the economy generally. It continues to employ large numbers of comparatively unskilled workers whose alternatives are limited and less attractive. Enlarging export markets, regaining old ones lost when the dollar's exchange rate went into the stratosphere -- these will be tough battles. It is at least encouraging that the industry takes on these battles, having kept intact the foundations of its economic progress even in the tough years of the 1980s.    ---   Mr. McCracken is Day distinguished professor emeritus of business administration at the University of Michigan.    ---                   Corporate Profits                (In billions of dollars)                                                INCREASE INDUSTRY               1981       1986      (In percent) Trade                 $32.5      $50.7             56.0% Financial              16.5       29.3             77.6 Manufacturing          88.5       73.4            -17.1 Other                  64.8       89.5             38.1 TOTAL                $202.3     $242.9             20.1% Source: U.S. Department of Commerce   ---                  Nonfarm Productivity              (Average annual increases) PERIOD         MANUFACTURING    NON-MANUFACTURING    TOTAL 1948 4Q to 1973 4Q                 2.7%                 2.1%     2.3% 1973 4Q to 1981 3Q                 1.5                  0.1      0.6 1981 3Q to 1986 3Q                 3.8                  0.1      1.1 Source: Economic Report of the President, January 1987</TEXT></DOC>
