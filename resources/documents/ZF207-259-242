 Technology InnovationCenter 906 University Pl.andP;  Evanston, IL 60201 (312) 491-2370 List Price: $495andM;Requires: 640K RAM, hard disk, Microsoft Mouse or other Windows-compatiblepointing device, Windows-compatible graphics display and adapter, Windows/286or Windows/386 2.1 or later, DOS 3.0 or later.andM;In Short: An object-oriented program development environment for producingWindows applications.andM;Simply put, Actor is a programming environment that helps you designMicrosoft Windows applications.andP;  A programmer's tool rather than anapplication generator, it won't do your thinking for you, but it can makeprogramming for Windows easier.andM;Instead of separating the active programming instructions from the passivedata, actor integrates the two into a unit called an object.andP;  Objects areeasily explained as smart data.andP;  Consider a dancer, a singer, and a pianoplayer.andP;  Without knowing anything about which is which, you can issue thecommand &quot;Perform!&quot;andP;  The command itself is ambiguous, but because theperformers (the data) are smart, they each know what to do.andM;Application development in Actor still requires program design, coding, andgeneration.andP;  First, you specify the objects needed by your program.andP;  Everyobject is simply a specific instance of a general, descriptive class.andP;  Aclass is somewhat analogous to a data type.andM;A large number of classes, many relating specifically to Windows, areavailable in the Actor environment.andP;  These can be used without anyprogramming effort.andP;  If you can't find one that's suitable, you can modify anexisting one by a process called inheritance.andP;  This ability makes it easy anddesirable to reuse code.andM;Once you define the objects, you then write the routines, or methods, thatthe objects will execute as they receive messages.andP;  For example, if youdefined an object called Table-Lamp and decide it should act on the messagesTurnOn and TurnOff, you would write two methods to implement those actions.andO;Despite the strangeness of the means, you still wind up with the same end.andM;Actor is an interpreter.andP;  This makes programming highly interactive and leadsto rapid application development.andP;  But, when complete, your application willrun only under Actor.andP;  If your goal is to produce a standalone version thatwill run under Windows, you must undertake a conversion process.andM;Creating a standalone application means taking the generic Actor runtimekernel, adding specific classes and methods you need, and removing those youdon't.andP;  After this editing, two files are produced: an .EXE file thatlaunches the application and an .IMA file that is really a runtime subset ofthe Actor environment.andP;  When executed, your finished program looks and runslike any other Windows application.andM;Actor 1.2 contains several improvements and changes from the previousversion.andP;  It now works only with Windows/286 and Windows/386, Version 2.1 andlater, but it gives programmers full access to all Windows 2.andP;  x functions,messages, styles, and resources.andP;  Overall performance is improved through theefficient use of expanded memory, if available.andM;The Debug and Browser tools have been improved by adding command shortcutsand scrolling improvements.andP;  Some of the biggest complaints about theenvironment have also been addressed.andP;  Fatal errors caused by using anincorrect number of arguments in a Windows function call or making a call toan invalid window have been eliminated.andM;The ease by which programmability (such as with a macro or batch language)can be included in your application is a major improvement.andP;  And despite theadditional functionality and overhead of running under Microsoft Windows,Actor performance remains quite acceptable.andM;Interfacing with C and Windows routines has been made easier by the additionof a new Actor class, CStruct.andP;  Three new facilities permit low-levelprogramming, including physical memory access, hardware I/O, and softwareinterrupts.andM;The first step to using Actor effectively is to understand object-orientedprogramming.andP;  If you've never used objects before, it will probably take youtwice as long to learn Actor as another linear language.andP;  But the program's600-page-plus manual provides an excellent tutorial on object-orientedprogramming and, overall, I believe you could turn out your first Windowsapplication sooner than if you learned to program for Windows in C.andM;Writing programs in Actor has a different feel than with traditionallanguages.andP;  Your aim is to minimize program complexity and thus produceeasily maintained code.andP;  But Actor can camouflage errors that occur at thehardware level or in the operating system routines.andP;  When deciding whether ornot to use Actor, it's important to know what's more important to you:understanding what Windows is doing at the hardware level or getting anapplication written quickly.andM;Who can benefit most from Actor?andP;  As more large firms develop in-houseapplications designed to run under the Windows environment, they'll findActor is a quick way to start turning out applications.andP;  I would recommendActor to anyone with an interest in programming for Windows.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
