Crops are yielding near-record abundance, and government subsidies, which are tied to production, are flowing freely. In Iowa alone, farmers will receive more loans and other aid from Washington this year than all the nations of Africa get from the World Bank.    Costs are declining for machinery and fertilizer, and livestock profits have risen. All told, farmers are raking in the biggest cash haul since Earl Butz, the former agriculture secretary, helped spark a mid-1970s farm boom by opening East-West grain trade.    And yet, for all the harvest's bounty, many economists believe that farming is locked into an inexorably shrinking role in the U.S. economic future.    &quot;There's no evidence that the high income of farmers is having any positive impact&quot; on the rest of the country, says Robert F. Benner, deputy commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Trade and Economic Development. &quot;It's only masking the deterioration of the farm economy.&quot;    Even as the current harvest winds down, the seeds are being sown for a reduced role for farming. Rural lenders, once burned, are reluctant to reinvest in agriculture. So are many of the nation's farmers, who, after reducing debts, have been plowing extra cash into other businesses and financial instruments.    Prices for farm exports -- once the biggest single positive contributor to the U.S. balance of trade -- are being held at low levels by heavy foreign competition. The nation's farm-trade surplus has dwindled by more than two-thirds since it contributed $24 billion to the 1982 trade balance. About 35% of net farm income is coming from direct government subsidies.    By the year 2000, farmers' contribution to the gross national product is likely to shrink to about 1%, down from 1.8% last year, predicts Luther Tweeten, an agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University. In 1973, farmers accounted for 3.7% of the GNP, the nation's total output of goods and services.    The paradox is evident all across the richest farm areas of Illinois, where trucks brimming with grain have been rolling through towns pockmarked by empty storefronts. The only grocery store in Varna, Ill., closed in September. &quot;Farmers have money,&quot; says Donald Lindstrom, the president of Marshall County State Bank. &quot;But it isn't priming the pump.&quot;    In Sadorus, Ill., a staggering 1.2 million bushels of corn stand piled in 30-foot mounds by the Grand Prairie Coop Inc. But in the nearby town of Tolono, farmers aren't spending their harvest windfall. A failed farm-equipment dealer remains closed. The local library is reducing services. Larry Throneburg, a grocery-store owner, &quot;can't tell much difference&quot; in his business compared with last year.    Farmers think their cash bonanza could be short-lived. The farmers' net cash income -- their gross cash income minus cash expense -- is expected to climb to between $54 billion and $58 billion this year, nearly double the level of six years ago.    But a recent internal estimate by the Agriculture Department shows net cash income sinking 5% in 1988. The stock market's recent collapse could accelerate that slide as waning consumer confidence undermines farm prices, which many say were already headed for a cyclical downturn.    Livestock receipts, a major contributor to the farm rally, are likely to edge up this year to an estimated $73 billion. But meat prices could decline next year as herds increase; some economists expect hog prices to drop by half. Federal farm subsidies are scheduled to be trimmed next year, through reductions in the amounts farmers can borrow against some crops and a lowering of the upper limit on subsidy payments. The renewed push to cut the federal deficit could lead to even smaller subsidies, some economists say.    &quot;I'm not too optimistic about a big recovery in agriculture,&quot; says John Little, a Tolono, Ill., corn and soybean farmer.    Such pessimism is prompting farmers to dabble in new investments. Reed Weinberg of Clarksville, Iowa, is considering buying annuities even while he reaps 150 bushels an acre from one of his best corn crops ever.    Fred G. Lins, a Spring Green, Wis., farmer who collected big profits on his hogs this year, has bought interests in a nursing home and an Aandamp;W root-beer stand. Life-insurance policies are hot in Iowa, where state law shields the policies from bill collectors.    Lenders also are eager to diversify. &quot;Rural banks don't want to put more money into agriculture,&quot; says George A. Morton, Indiana's deputy agriculture commissioner. &quot;They'd rather go to Indianapolis and Fort Wayne, looking for real-estate investments.&quot;    Lenders are tightening credit standards. The Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank found in a survey earlier this year that the region's banks were lending only about 48 cents of each dollar deposited with them, the lowest amount in 10 years. &quot;Country banks are swimming in cash,&quot; says Mark Drabenstott, an economist for the Kansas City Fed.    Many banks would rather channel that cash into Treasury and other debt securities than make loans to farmers or farm suppliers. According to Dell Hanson, a Benton County supervisor in Iowa, &quot;The local banks are so gun-shy, they'd rather run from you than talk to you.&quot;    In an effort to keep from adding to heavy world supplies of farm commodities, U.S. government programs for three years have been reducing the number of acres planted in wheat, corn and soybeans. U.S. grain output has risen just 5% in the past 10 years while non-U.S. output jumped 25%, although the U.S. remains the world's largest grain supplier.    As foreign producers bring new land under the plow, U.S. land in production continues to dwindle, with a land mass the size of Colorado lying idle this year. WEFA Group, a consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., predicts that U.S. acreage in production in 1990 will rise slightly from current levels to 310 million acres, which would still be 8.6% below the average of the past nine years. The number of U.S. farms has declined 10% in five years. And the number of middle-sized farms -- those with annual revenue of $40,000 to $100,000 -- will continue to shrink more than 2% a year through the end of the century, predicts Mr. Tweeten of Oklahoma State University.    Farm exports are turning up after a five-year tumble, but low prices are eclipsing their value to the U.S. economy. Wheat exports in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 rose an estimated 14%, but their value declined 11% from the prior year. Corn volume increased about 27% while the value fell 6%.    Agriculture's contribution to total U.S. exports has fallen steadily, dropping to roughly 11% earlier this year from 19% in the early 1980s. The farm-trade surplus in the latest fiscal year is believed to have widened only slightly to $7.5 billion, a drop in the bucket in comparison with the nation's $147 billion trade deficit in the 11 months through Aug. 30. (By contrast, the 1981 farm-trade surplus slashed the total trade deficit in half.)    Farmers are increasingly disillusioned by their dependence on federal aid. A corn grower can wring about $3.31 a bushel from government programs, more than double the price of $1.54 a bushel available on the open market, says Robert Wisner, an Iowa State University economics professor.    According to James Zeeb, a grain and hog farmer in Greenville, Ill., &quot;The only way to show a profit is to take full advantage of subsidies, the whole ball of wax. Without them, there's no profit.&quot;    Mr. Little, whose Tolono, Ill., farm has been in the family since 1868, says, &quot;I don't see a future for our children on the farm. I don't want them to continue to live on government subsidies.&quot;    But prospects are slim for reduced dependence on Washington. John Urbanchuk, an economist with the consulting firm of Government Research Corp. in Washington, expects the government to continue to contribute about 30% or more of net farm income through 1990. Agriculture's reliance on the government, he says, is &quot;going to stay high by historical standards.&quot;    Only a broader recovery, with higher prices for corn and soybeans, can get farmers to reinvest in farming and the businesses that support it, says Jim Nichols, Minnesota's agriculture commissioner. &quot;Right now it's a false economy because it's based on government dollars,&quot; he says.    The withering of farm towns reflects these larger trends. The outpouring of federal cash hasn't been sufficient to reverse an exodus of people from such states as Iowa, where the population has declined every year since 1982. Iowa is getting a total of $4.7 billion in federal farm loans, cash and commodity certificates in connection with the 1987 harvest, which amounts to about $46,000 for each of the state's 102,000 farms. Personal income in the state in the first quarter, when many subsidy payments were mailed out, jumped 11.1% from the fourth quarter, or five times the national rate. But second-quarter income fell 6.6% as fewer checks arrived.    Agriculture's diminished role offers little incentive for businesses to start up again in small towns. The result is what analysts say may be a permanent shrinkage of the economic underpinnings of rural areas.    In Norway, Iowa, the only business to reopen in recent years was a tavern. Now it is closing again. &quot;The farmers are putting more money in their pockets,&quot; says Margaret Gorkow, the city clerk. &quot;But they're not spending it to get things going. There's no recovery here.&quot;    In Varna, Ill., there are fewer goods for farmers to buy. The Buick dealership and an insurance business have closed. The farm-implement store has been reduced to selling lawn mowers. Many of the products sold here can be purchased for less in Lacon, the county seat.    A rebound isn't in sight for rural America, says University of Minnesota professor Michael Boehlje. &quot;Once the pattern is set,&quot; he says, &quot;it is hard to break.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
