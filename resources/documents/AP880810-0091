Also today, Tehran Radio said Iraqi warplanes violated Iranianairspace in the southwest. No bombing was reported. The officialIraqi News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, carried no reports offighting.   Cyrus Nasseri, head of the Iranian mission to the United Nationsin Geneva, spoke at an international conference organized by Iranto discuss ``aggression and defense.'' Direct peace talks betweenIran and Iraq are scheduled to begin Aug. 25.   ``The talks in Geneva are going to be very difficult. Iran'srights have to be preserved,'' he said, using Iran's shorthand forits repeated demand that Iraq be identified as starting the war.   Iran also wants ``compensation for aggression,'' he said. He didnot make any detailed reference to the claims. Official Iranianassessments have put the cost of war damage at $350 billion.   ``If there is a positive response from the internationalcommunity to this key issue then we can hope for lasting peace,''he said.   Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after border skirmishes.   Nasseri said Iran decided on uly 18 to accept a U.N. cease-fireresolution partly because the superpowers and other countries weresiding with Iraq and imposing a full political and economic embargoon Iran.   ``To avoid further loss of life and property, it was decided togive another chance to reconciliation,'' he said.   Nasseri said the West and countries around the Persian Gulfrejected conciliatory approaches from Iran. He said the UnitedStates wanted Iran in trouble ``because in the back of their mindsthey thought this could resolve their problems, such as the hostagecrisis.''   Nine Americans are among 18 foreigners believed held hostage inLebanon by pro-Iranian groups.   Nasseri made repeated references to two schools of thought inthe Iranian leadership: those in favor of conciliation and thosewho prefer a defiant stance.   ``At every instance (in the past) one can see that Iran's intentwas to use a conciliatory approach but it was pushed into acorner,'' he said. ``That left no alternative. We were forced onthe path of defiance.''   Tehran Radio also said the Cabinet discussed post-warreconstruction efforts today and reviewed implementing thecease-fire accords after a briefing by Foreign Minister Ali AkbarVelayati. It did not elaborate.   Velayati returned to Tehran today after spending three weeksnegotiating at the United Nations.   Five members of the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Grouparrived today to supervise implementation of a cease-fire, theofficial Islamic Republic news agency reported.   The observers initially will work in the southern and westernareas of the country to monitor military movements until thecease-fire starts officially on Aug. 20, IRNA said.   The full contingent of 350 observers from 25 countries isexpected to be in place within a week, well before the scheduledcease-fire date, according to U.N. officials.</TEXT></DOC>
