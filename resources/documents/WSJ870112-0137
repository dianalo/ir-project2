The dynasty was founded by Milos Obrenovich, a prosperous Serbian pig merchant of the early 1800s who led a successful revolt against the Ottoman sultan and won autonomy for his country. Milos consolidated his power by having his rival Black George Petrovic (known as Karadjordje, Kara being the Turkish word for black) treacherously murdered. Milos then sent the severed head of Karadjordje on a platter to the sultan in Istanbul.    A later descendent of Milos, King Alexander I (not V) Obrenovich, was murdered in 1903 by conspirators belonging to the Black Hand military officers' organization. Alexander had made a woman of dubious past his queen, and then the childless royal couple pretended that the queen's sister's baby was their own child. They even duped Russia's Czar Nicholas II into being the godfather. Eventually, the scandal was revealed, and it prompted the Black Hand to liquidate the king and queen. Several Serbian officers entered the palace at night and hacked the royal couple with their sabers, then threw the bleeding bodies out of the window.    Considering bloody Serbian history, &quot;King&quot; Marziano should consider himself lucky to live in Italy, and should stay there.    And by the way, neither the Serbian rulers of the 19th century, nor the Yugoslav kings after 1918, granted any titles of nobility. Only members of the immediate ruling family bore titles.    Prof. Matthew Mestrovic   Fairleigh Dickinson University   Teaneck, N.J.   ---   Your article states that &quot;the sale of royal titles is a booming business. Strutt and Parker, an auction house, hawked lordships in London recently for about $10,000 each.&quot;    This is misleading. There is an auction market, conducted by that firm and others, in English lordships of manors, which sometimes include certain obsolescent rights associated with a manor, e.g., that of holding a fair. It is essentially a completely empty title: technically, an &quot;incorporeal hereditament.&quot; A lord of a manor is not a peer. He remains plain Mr. Jones, and would violate British law if he styled himself Lord Jones there. He can contemplate the documents associated with the lordship, but not take them out of England.
