Two-minute television spots, known as &quot;advertorials&quot; because of their informational approach, were scheduled to begin running last night in major Midwestern markets where the cereal is sold. The advertorial format allows a company to convey much more information than it can in a typical 30-second commercial. General Mills positioned the spots around evening news shows.    As part of its marketing makeover for Benefit, General Mills this week ran full-page newspaper advertisements and it held a news conference in New York on Tuesday to back up Benefit's cholesterol-lowering claim.    Moreover, to gain attention and credibility, the company hired former tennis pro Arthur Ashe to appear in the television spots. Mr. Ashe, the victim of a heart attack in 1979 that halted his career, says his cholesterol level at the time was an ominous 264. {Mr. Ashe previously did ads for Bufferin, which cited studies indicating that aspirin can help prevent second heart attacks.}    Benefit derives its name and health claim from the large amount of soluble fiber it contains. The new print ads note that the soluble fiber in Benefit is eight times that of oat bran, which it contains. But it also has beet fiber, rice and psyllium husks. It is the psyllium that has brought Benefit under fire from rival cereal makers and has raised questions at the Food and Drug Administration about health claims on foods.    &quot;We're concerned that there's been a lot of unfavorable publicity,&quot; General Mills vice chairman Arthur Schulze said, adding that it has hurt sales of the new cereal.    Before introducing Benefit last April, General Mills paid for a 14-week dietary experiment, done at the University of Minnesota, with 38 men thought to have high cholesterol levels in their blood. When put on a low-fat diet, those who ate bowls of Benefit every day for six weeks experienced greater declines in their cholesterol counts than did those who ate corn flakes {a mainstay at General Mills' chief rival, Kellogg Co.}    According to General Mills, the test found that the low-fat diet alone lowered every subject's cholesterol about 3%, but that those who also ate Benefit achieved an additional 6% decline while the corn flakes eaters had none. The Minnesota study is believed to be the only one showing a direct link between psyllium consumption and reduced cholesterol. Numerous others have correlated high fiber with lower cholesterol.    Boxes of Benefit advertise it as &quot;the high soluble fiber cereal shown to reduce cholesterol when part of a low-fat diet.&quot; But the words &quot;reduce cholesterol&quot; are in much larger type that the rest of the message. Each box also contains warnings about possible allergic reaction to psyllium, and recommends that children don't eat as much of the cereal as adults.    Psyllium is the primary bulk ingredient in such laxatives as Procter andamp; Gamble Co.'s Metamucil. {Procter andamp; Gamble has protested General Mills' claim for Benefit since it has been unable to win FDA approval for a similar cholesterol-reducing claim for Metamucil, which is regulated as a drug.}    The FDA is expected to notify General Mills within a few days that it wants more information about the claims. Mr. Schulze said the company decided not wait for the letter before changing its emphasis to &quot;a more educational campaign.    &quot;In no way have we backed off on our claims,&quot; he said. &quot;The product is in the public interest.&quot;    Late last month Kellogg introduced a psyllium-fortified cereal called Heartwise, and attacked General Mills without name, suggesting that the industry adopt standards for appropriate health claims for foods. Then last week Quaker Oats Co. issued its own proposed set of standards. Quaker, which is big on oat-bran products, also went out of its way to say it &quot;will not add psyllium to a cereal product until either the FDA definitively deals with the subject or a credible base of scientific research says it is proper to do so.&quot;    Alluding to the competitors' outcrys, Mr. Schulze said General Mills believes &quot;it's the responsibility of the FDA to establish policies on this matter.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
