But recently some senators called his work &quot;absurd,&quot; &quot;illogical&quot; and &quot;distorted.&quot;    Mr. Sofaer is the author of a controversial reinterpretation of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty that would permit wider testing of President Reagan's &quot;Star Wars&quot; defense system. Many arms control experts claim his reading is politically motivated and would gut the treaty by contradicting 15 years of established practice under the U.S.-Soviet pact.    The aggressive Mr. Sofaer, who has a strong influence on many foreign policy issues, may be upsetting the delicate balance between his dual roles as the secretary of state's lawyer and the senior U.S. official charged with making sure that foreign policy conforms to international law. Too often, he is perceived as being out in front of the parade, rather than keeping an eye on the procession.    &quot;I think he's smart, but I also feel he's applying his talents in directions that are not necessarily consistent with what the State Department should be doing,&quot; says Sen. Carl Levin, a member of the Armed Services Committee. &quot;I don't view the State Department's position as undermining treaties,&quot; adds the Michigan Democrat.    Last week, Mr. Sofaer, 48 years old, angered even his supporters by trying to deflect some of the congressional criticism of his interpretation on the Antiballistic Missile Treaty by blaming a young staff lawyer for careless research. The remark angered the White House, which fears Mr. Sofaer may have undercut his interpretation, and prompted some protesting staff members to don yellow stickers saying, &quot;I am not a young lawyer.&quot;    Arms control is only one of the issues in which the feisty, 5-foot-4-inch legal adviser is embroiled. Justice Department officials claim that he was too soft on Israel when he headed a task force investigating Jonathan Pollard, a U.S. analyst convicted of spying for Israel. And international lawyers complain that he is on shaky ground when he pushes his hard-line view that the U.S. has the legal right to kidnap suspected terrorists and use force against states that harbor them.    Some experts fear that the result may be that the U.S., once in the forefront of developing international law, now is seen by some other nations as bending statutes to suit its national security goals. They cite such incidents as last year's naval maneuvers near the Gulf of Sidra as a thinly disguised attempt to use international law concerning freedom of navigation as an excuse to provoke Libya into attacking U.S. ships.    &quot;He has to be not only the advocate, but the legal conscience of the country,&quot; says Richard Bilder, professor of law at the University of Wisconsin and a former attorney in the legal adviser's office. &quot;Part of his job is reflecting the point of view that international law has its own integrity, and that the long-term interests of the country are best served by a policy of respect for international law. There are some of us who believe he has not done as much as we'd like to see in that area.&quot;    Mr. Sofaer declined to be interviewed for this article.    Delicate and diplomatic are two words that aren't usually associated with Mr. Sofaer. &quot;He's a very bright fellow, but he has no experience in international law and seems to leap at very radical conclusions based on what looks like superficial research,&quot; says Alfred Rubin, professor of international law at Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.    Unlike most of his cautious predecessors, who dispensed behind-the-scenes legal advice to the department's bureaucracy, Abe Sofaer's ingenuity and boundless energy have made him a high-profile foreign policy player and given him direct access to the secretary of state, George Shultz.    Late one evening in October 1985, for instance, Mr. Sofaer was finishing his controversial reinterpretation of the U.S.-Soviet arms control agreement, which was due the next day, when he learned the U.S. had forced down an Egyptian aircraft carrying terrorists who had killed an American. Immediately convening a legal task force to study extradition procedures, he worked through the night, shuttling between both projects and keeping himself and the staff awake by ordering endless rounds of pizza and singing operatic arias in his rich baritone voice. He produced a novel theory of using piracy laws to go after terrorists.    He has some other novel ideas too. Concerning the kidnapping of suspected terrorists, for instance, he once said, &quot;You might just find a fellow somewhere -- all tied up. He might be sent to a country where we have an effective extradition treaty.&quot; Wouldn't that be illegal kidnapping? he was asked. &quot;We're talking about informal civilized arrangements with friends,&quot; he replied with a smile.    A senior administration official says Mr. Sofaer's views in part are colored by his early months on the job, when he was closely questioned by conservatives because he had been appointed to the bench in New York by President Carter, following a distinguished career as a law professor at Columbia University. He is a member of a slim minority within a minority -- a Jew raised in Bombay, India, by parents of Iraqi origin.    The senior official, who has had many dealings with Mr. Sofaer, says that in conversations, the former judge goes out of his way to support &quot;the aims of the administration,&quot; and to &quot;pepper his conversations with references of support for the president.&quot;    Nevertheless, there is broad agreement that Mr. Sofaer has brought a new prominence to the tiny legal adviser's office. For example, the bureau, known as &quot;L&quot; in the department's bureaucratic parlance, was put in charge when Secretary Shultz set up a task force to provide information to the various agencies and committees investigating the Iran-Contra scandal. &quot;It's the first I can remember us heading anything up,&quot; says Michael Kozak, a 16-year veteran.    Four days after Mr. Sofaer was appointed to the office, in June 1985, he plunged into his work when hijackers seized a Trans World Airlines jet in the Middle East and killed an American passenger. He quickly saw a way to satisfy the terrorists' demand that certain Shiite prisoners in Israel be released. Several years earlier, the U.S. had stated that the prisoners were being held illegally and should be freed, so, Mr. Sofaer reasoned, all the administration had to do was restate its position. He took the idea directly to Mr. Shultz, who agreed.    &quot;There is a sense of energy and competence in the bureau now,&quot; adds Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs. &quot;People very much want the legal adviser's views and care what he thinks.&quot;    Justice Department officials, however, criticize Mr. Sofaer's handling of the Pollard spy case. After he led a joint State-Justice investigating team to Israel in December 1985, he said Jerusalem had been fully cooperative, when, in fact, the Israelis had withheld information from the team. William Webster, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (who recently was selected by President Reagan to take over as director of the Central Intelligence Agency), said Israel had provided only &quot;selective cooperation.&quot;    Mr. Sofaer's supporters say Justice officials aren't accustomed to the delicate diplomacy needed when dealing with sovereign states. They assert that Mr. Sofaer's method produced more, not less, cooperation from Israel. </TEXT></DOC>
