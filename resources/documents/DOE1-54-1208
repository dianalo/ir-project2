However, there are few reports concerningexposure doses in DSA. This study examined exposure doses generated byusing a Siemens' DSA equipment, Digitron 2 (pulse mode). Exposure dosesof DSA was 44 rad when phantom thickness was 20 cm and zoom was usedat the middle exposure level. This emphasizes the need for consideringthe radiation field and the number of phrames per second. Ready use ofDSA with good image quality and simple techniques might cause radiationdoses to increase. The optimum approach to DSA is recommended. (Namekawa,K.).</TEXT></DOC>
