The breakdown in Monday's edition of Pravda, the Communist Partynewspaper, did not however account for differences between East andWest over how to interpret the figures.   Those differences have for 15 years stymied negotiations onreducing conventional forces in Europe.   In its statement, the Soviet bloc acknowledges having twice asmany tanks in Europe as NATO _ far below the 3-1 advantage allegedby the West _ but claims the West has the advantage in attackaircraft and personnel.   Hence, the Soviets asserted, the strength of the two sides isabout equal.   Western experts did not agree.   ``It is clear that the idea of a rough parity of forces in Europedoes not correspond to the factual situation,'' said Henry Sloan, aspokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.   Gen. John Galvin, the alliance's American military commander,declared: ``I definitely do not agree that a rough parity ofconventional forces already exists in Europe.''   Warsaw Pact defense ministers said in a statement that thefigures add up to ``rough parity'' in conventional forces. They saidthe Western alliance has issued ``tendentious data based on aselective approach.''   New negotiations on conventional forces are to begin March 7 inVienna. Those talks were given a boost Dec. 7 when President MikhailS. Gorbachev said the Kremlin would reduce the Red Army by half amillion soldiers by 1991.   Moscow also says it will get rid of 10,000 tanks, 8,500 artillerysystems and 800 combat planes.   The other Warsaw Pact countries _ Romania, Bulgaria,Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East Germany and Poland _ have alsoannounced cuts in their military forces.   Pravda's report said the 16-nation NATO alliance has 2.1 millionground troops in Europe facing 1.8 million from the Warsaw Pactcountries, and 685,000 sailors in nearby seas compared to only338,000 for the East bloc.   NATO contends the Warsaw Pact has 3.1 million ground troops,while the alliance has 2.2 million.   The Pravda report acknowledged a 2-1 Warsaw Pact advantage intanks, and its tables also showed a heavy advantage for the East inarmored personnel carriers and combat infantry vehicles.   A Western analyst in Moscow said privately that the Warsaw Pactappeared to have tailored the categories of forces to support itslong-standing contention that the sides are about equal.   He noted that NATO contends the Eastern alliance has qualitativesuperiority in virtually every major weapons system.   Sample comparative figures illustrate the differences in strengthestimates.   The report in Pravda says the Warsaw Pact has 59,470 tanks to30,690 for NATO, but the Western alliance says the figures are51,500 to 16,424.   Although the Soviets say the West has a dramatic advantage instrike aircraft and helicopters, NATO says the Warsaw Pact has acomfortable edge.   Warsaw Pact figures say NATO has superior numbers of groundtroops, air forces, navy personnel, strike aircraft, helicopters andlarge surface ships, while the East is ahead in tanks, tacticalmissile launchers, interceptor aircraft, artillery and infantryvehicles and armored personnel carriers.   In its November report on troops in Europe, NATO said the Easthad more soldiers, main battle tanks, armored infantry fightingvehicles, artillery, anti-tank weapons, air defense systems,helicopters, combat aircraft and armored vehicle launched bridges.   That report did not include naval forces, which NATO said ``arecapable of global deployment, and this makes it artificial toidentify specific numbers of ships associated with any one region.''   Analysts generally feel the West has a qualitative edge intactical aircraft and naval forces, neither of which is to beincluded in the Vienna negotiations.</TEXT></DOC>
