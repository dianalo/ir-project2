We wish to review the entire spectrum of pedicular lesions:the embryology, normal anatomy, normal variants, pitfalls, congenitalanomalies, and pathological conditions are discussed. Different imagingmodalities involving CT, isotope bone scanning, and Magnetic ResonanceImaging (MRI) are used to complement plain films of the lumbar spine.This subject review is an excellent source for future reference to lumbarpedicular lesions. 27 references.</TEXT></DOC>
