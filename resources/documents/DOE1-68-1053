Cured productsof above 95% of gel contents were obtained from liquid oligomers withan onium initiator content of 0.05 mol/kg. For solid oligomers the finallevelling-off gel content decreased with increasing molecular weightof the original oligomer. However, unreacted epoxide bonds still remainedin the cured system, although the gel content had almost reached itsmaximum. The post effect of curing was observed the present system. Afterirradiation, the decay of epoxide bonds continues following first orderreaction kinetics and the apparent rate constant is directly proportionalto the preirradiation dose. Dynamic mechanical studies show that heat-treatmentafter room temperature irradiation gives the cured product of higherglass transition temperature and crosslinking density than those of theproduct cured with tertiary amine at elevated temperature.</TEXT></DOC>
