It said the bidder, Cilva Holdings PLC, valued Avis Europe at896.5 million pounds, the equivalent of $1.4 billion, or 600 pence ashare.   Avis Europe shares soared 32 pence to 592 pence on the LondonStock Exchange by midmorning.   Cilva is 64.7-percent-owned by Lease International SA, aLuxembourg-based holding company which already owns 33.6 percent ofAvis's existing shares. Avis Inc. owns 8.8 percent of Cilva andGeneral Motors Capital Corp. has the rest.   Cilva is said to have has assurances of an additional 26.4percent of Avis Europe's share capital, leaving 40 percent of AvisEurope's shares outstanding. Avis Europe's board, except for threeindividuals, has recommended that its shareholders take up the Cilvaoffer.   Three years ago Avis Inc. owned Avis Europe, but was taken overin a leveraged buyout by Westray Capital Corp, a U.S. consortium,which then floated 66 percent of Avis Europe on the London StockExchange. Relations between the two Avis groups remained friendly.   Wesray sold Avis Inc. to the rental company's employees in 1987.   Lease International, consisting of two Belgian investors, wasformed solely to hold Avis Europe's shares, and said upon completingthe offer an appropriate environment would exist for reuniting AvisEurope and Avis Inc.   This, it said, would enhance the growth prospects of bothcompanies.   Avis Europe, Avis Inc. and Lease International said they see``strong commercial reasons'' for uniting the two Avis units, whichwill be easier and more highly leveraged under a private companystructure.   The announcement was seen as underlining Avis Inc.'s desire for afoothold in Europe before 1992, when the 12 nations of The EuropeanEconomic Community are to drop their trade barriers.   In the financial year ended February, Avis Europe reported a 31percent rise in pretax profits to 72 million pounds.</TEXT></DOC>
