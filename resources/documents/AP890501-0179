He spoke to about 4,000 demonstrators opposing the leftistSandinista government who later marched for two hours throughworking-class neighborhoods of Managua under a sweltering middaysun.   Earlier Monday, about 20,000 pro-government demonstratorsgathered at the Plaza de la Revolucion in Managua's former downtownarea, destroyed by a 1972 earthquake.   Lucio Jimenez, secretary-general of the Sandinista WorkersUnion, condemned the 4-year-old U.S. economic blockade and accused``reactionary Nicaraguan capitalists'' of impeding the country'sindustries.   He praised the government's call to investors to help reactivateNicaragua's paralyzed economy, warning them this was their chance``for continuing to live or disappear.''   Victor Tirado, one of the nine members of the SandinistaNational Directorate, told the rally peace won't come to Nicaraguauntil the United States stops supporting the Nicaraguan rebels,known as Contras. Last month Congress approved a $49.7 millionpackage of non-lethal aid for the Contras, most of whom are livingin jungle camps in neighboring Honduras.   The United States cut off all financial aid to Nicaragua in 1981after alleging the Sandinista government was supporting leftistinsurgents in El Salvador. In 1985, then-President Reagan imposed acommercial embargo on this Central American country, sayingNicaragua had established close military ties with Cuba and theSoviet Union.   Private buiness people say the embargo isn't halting the flow ofU.S.-made goods to Nicaragua and only makes parts and equipmentmore expensive to acquire because they have to route the itemsthrough a third country.   Economists say the government's 3-month-old austerity program isshowing results in slowing hyperinflation that topped 20,000percent in 1988. But they say those same measures have created arecession that could prove fatal to the economy if allowed tocontinue into the planting season. The season traditionally startsin mid-May, the beginning of the rainy season.   President Daniel Ortega is on a 10-country European tour to askfor more financial aid for Nicaragua. Sweden, the main WestEuropean supporter of the 10-year-old Sandinista revolution, hasorganized a Stockholm conference May 11-12 so Ortega can presenthis case before potential donors.</TEXT></DOC>
