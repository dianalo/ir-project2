But maybe, some folks are now saying, the attention is a bitoverdone.   The widespread, almost automatic assumption made is that moneyspent on new plants and equipment and in developing new products isan investment that returns itself many times over.   Economists, political leaders, academics and others watch theseitems for other reasons as well. Such spending, for example,supposedly shows the level of confidence in the future, and it isequated with more efficient production.   Now comes an authority on productivity who cautions againstfalling in love with such expenditures. Not that they areunimportant, says C. Jackson Grayson Jr. But, he says, let us notlose our perspective.   Grayson, probably best remembered as chairman of PresidentRichard Nixon's price commission, has been studying productivityissues for the past decade, mainly as chairman of the AmericanProductivity Center in Houston.   Among other activities, he also served on President JimmyCarter's Commission on the Agenda for the '80s and was a member ofPresident Reagan's National Productivity Advisory Committee.Productivity is his specialty.   From that background, he issues what is likely to be consideredan almost sacrilegious criticism: ``Capital investment is not theprincipal cause of productivity growth nor of its slowdown.''   With Carla O'Dell, vice president of the productivity center,Grayson has written ``American Business: A Two-Minute Warning,'' avolume examining the sometimes surprising relationship betweencapital investment and productivity.   Such spending hardly correlates with increased productivity, forexample. As they point out, U.S. productivity growth declined from1965 to 1978 while capital investment increased during the sameperiod.   In fact, they say, ``capital investment may well be the resultof growth, rather than its source _ better growth prospects attractmore investment.''   The concentration on physical investment, on plants andequipment, also has led to a relative neglect of factors that areequally or even more important for productivity and qualityimprovement, Grayson and O'Dell say.   They observe, for example, that investments in human capital,though not as often examined as physical investments, areespecially important in improving quality and production. Cananyone deny that quality education doesn't pay off?   Those who place great faith in dollar amounts also might bemisguided in another respect. Grayson and O'Dell observe that``there is a difference between the volume of capital investmentand the productivity of that investment.''   Grayson can speak on that subject both as an experienced handand as an academic authority. Where, for example, is it moreevident than in government that throwing money at a situation doesnot necessarily improve it?   In this respect, the authors call attention to a concept thatmight not be correct for these times: Why do we still believe thatlong production runs, greater volume, big factories and automationmean greater productivity?   They observe that ``the best American and Japanese firms haveshown that it is often more productive to focus on less, not more:small batches, small inventories, and flexibile, simple machines.''   They have a special message for politicans and governmentofficials:   ``Among the more important things government at all levels coulddo are improve education, privatize more government services,improve the collections and reporting of competitivenessstatistics, improve productivity in government and cut the budgetdeficit.''   That, not just money, is bound to improve productivity, they say.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Tues July 5</NOTE></DOC>
