The four-member team is to interview and issue travel documentsto the returnees, government spokesman Akber Khan said.   Last month 75 Vietnamese who fled their homeland and came tothis British colony voluntarily returned to Vietnam in the firstmajor repatriation of boat people in Hong Kong.   Those and the members of the new group are among about 12,000Vietnamese who arrived in the colony after the Hong Kong governmentintroduced a tough new policy last June. The policy regards thoserefugees who arrived after June as illegal immigrants unless theycan prove they fled Vietnam because of persecution.   More than 26,000 Vietnamese are now in Hong Kong, including morethan 2,000 who arrived this year. Vietnamese and Vietnamese ofChinese descent are continuing to flee Vietnam, but the biggestexodus occurred within months after communist forces defeated theU.S.-backed South Vietnamese government in the spring of 1975.   Vietnam and the U.N. Office of High Commissioner for Refugeessigned an agreement last year for the voluntary return of refugees,with Vietnam promising the returnees would not be mistreated andthe United Nations to provide reintegration assistance.</TEXT></DOC>
