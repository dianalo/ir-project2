Mr. Eshbaugh, a botany professor at Miami University inOxford, Ohio, isn't here to save coca; he is combing thescorched sierra for wild pepper. Pepper has little in commonwith coca, except that both are indigenous to the region. Andthe natives have an indispensable affinity for both. But as abotanist, he sees great folly in America's latest anti-drugefforts.</LP><TEXT>   Besides disregarding the South American natives' extensivecultural and religious use of the coca plants, U.S. policyrecommending crop eradication ignores the potentiallycatastrophic effect that such a policy could have on theecology of the region. This also could affect the well-beingof millions of people outside this region in ways as yetunexplored by eradication proponents.   The targeted area -- here in Bolivia and in neighboringPeru -- is a cradle of many valuable food crops now commonthe world over. Here, the plants' wild ancestors remain as arepository of valuable genes. These genes can be used tostrengthen existing varieties or create entirely new strainsmore resistant to disease. What the U.S. proposes, as Mr.Eshbaugh and other scientists see it, threatens to createnothing short of havoc in the region.   The Bush administration earlier this year proposed a $6.5million fund to develop biological efforts at the U.S.Agriculture Department. A deadly herbicide called &quot;Spike,&quot;made by the pharmaceutical concern Eli Lilly, already hasbeen tested by the agency. But given the controversy that haserupted over its indiscriminate destructive power (cocaplantations are interspersed with subsistence crops), anagency spokesman says a decision about its use will be madeonly by the international narcotics office of the StateDepartment.   Before proposing the use of such biological and chemicaltechniques, the USDA tested swarms of coca-eatingcaterpillars on plots in the Upper Huallaga Valley of Peru.The plan was scuttled, says an agency spokesman, &quot;because thecaterpillars can be killed easily.&quot;   But in contemplating biological and chemical attacks, theU.S. might be endangering a region that, if anything, needsmore protection. Potatoes, pepper, lima beans and tomatoesare among the betterknown crops that have evolved in theregion. &quot;Dozens more have the potential of becoming majorcommercial crops one day,&quot; says Noel Vietmeyer, a specialiston Inca crops at the National Research Council in Washington.While he doesn't know enough about viruses and microbes tocomment on their potential impact on the region, Mr.Vietmeyer cites example after example of important geneticmaterials that are disappearing in the &quot;cradle regions&quot; dueto human interference.   The Andean region itself is getting a lot of attentionlately from international botanists and plant breeders.That's because many of the widely commercialized crops, suchas potatoes and pepper, have lost their natural variabilityand are succumbing to viruses and other diseases. The genesthat can improve them reside in their wild ancestors -- herein the Andes. It's this that brings Mr. Eshbaugh here. Hethinks Bolivia is the region where peppers originated andhence is likely to have plants with the greatest geneticdiversity. (A 1983 report by the U.N.'s International Boardfor Plant Genetic Resources singled out pepper &quot;as a croprating high global priority&quot; in collecting and savingancestral genes of modern crops.)   While a potent herbicide like Spike can causeindiscriminate damage, U.S. officials argue in defense ofbiological techniques that a virus or a microbe &quot;tailored&quot; toattack a specific plant wouldn't spread to any other. But itdoesn't go unnoticed among the botanists in South Americathat the U.S. applies different standards within its ownborders.   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency keeps a tight lidon American biotechnology companies' experiments that involvereleasing micro-organisms. In 1983, the California-basedAdvanced Genetic Sciences Corp. researchers sprayed afrost-fighting bacteria on a patch of strawberry plants. Thescientists who did the spraying wore spacesuits. Theexperiment itself drew public outcry, and the company had toshelve the project. Environmental restrictions on testsinvolving release of microbes in crops -- justified or not --have set back quite a few American biotechnology companies.Although less restrictive today, the EPA still requires&quot;barrier&quot; crops around genetically altered plants.   It isn't surprising that Bolivia and Peru, pressuredthough they are to cooperate on a program of coca eradicationin return for much-needed economic aid, are reacting stronglyto the U.S.'s latest plans. Alberto Fujimori, the newlyelected president of Peru, has declared that he won't allowthe spraying of herbicides or biological agents detrimentalto the environment. The ambassadors of the two countriesrecently said in a letter to the Washington Post that whiletheir governments pledged cooperation at the drug summit inCartagena, Colombia, the U.S.'s latest drug-fighting tactics&quot;would destroy the working partnership that now exists.&quot;   Both Bolivia and Peru have proposed plans to encouragefarmers to grow substitute crops as a way of slashing cocaproduction. But in both countries, conventional crops havelost out to coca, a hardy plant that's easy to grow. Aserious lack of adequate farming machinery and pesticides --as well as a poor export infrastructure -- hampersconventional farming. This is precisely where the U.S. couldmake a difference in limiting coca production.   Crop substitution won't be an easy thing to accomplish aslong as North America and Europe keep demanding cocaine, theagricultural experts here believe. Nevertheless, the price ofcoca is on the decline, and this might be a good time for theU.S. to reallocate its resources from crop destruction tocrop substitution. At least one crop is already economicallymore attractive than coca.   In a vast field of &quot;locoto&quot; peppers nestled in a mountainrange, not too far from the coca-growing Chapare region, afarmer says of his lush waist-high crop: &quot;This is the mostprofitable of all crops, more than tomatoes and beans.&quot;   &quot;Even coca?&quot; he is asked.   The coca-chewing farmer, who's constantly reaching into asmall plastic bag of dried leaves he's carrying, nods inagreement: &quot;For 50 kilograms {of locoto peppers} I can makebetween $20 and $80, depending upon the season.&quot; This is farmore than what he could get for a comparative amount of coca.Later, Mr. Eshbaugh says of the farmer and his family: &quot;Theywere unusually educated. Growing locoto requires a veryspecialized knowledge of pesticides and growing conditions.&quot;This is the kind of technical assistance coca-growingpeasants need.   ---   Mr. Naj is a Journal reporter who is completing a book onpepper for Alfred A.
