 Long touted as a savior of typists everywhere, it has moved forwardin fits and starts, gradually transmuting from a special application forfinancial uses (reading forms, code numbers from checks, etc.) into aproductive tool for many fields.andM;In the late '80s, OCR came to the masses.andP;  What cost many thousands ofdollars and ran only on expensive hardware early in the decade is now soldfor hundreds of dollars to owners of garden-variety personal computers.andM;This isn't to say, of course, that a few C-notes will bring you flawless textfiles eternally.andP;  Low-priced software can produce adequate characterrecognition for relatively small volumes of typical documents.andP;  Large-volumeusers and those with exacting requirements, though, will be attracted to morepowerful (and expensive) hardware-based solutions.andM;Publishers are a leading market for OCR.andP;  Their applications run the gamut:converting printed data to electronic databases for reference; entering acontributed article into a composition system without retyping it; reprintingexisting articles from other sources; replacing data lost through accident,negligence or lack of foresight; and a wealth of special applications.andM;We have often reported on OCR products in our coverage of major shows.andP;  (In1977 and 1980, we also examined the state of the OCR art--which at the timeconsisted solely of large, dedicated hardware systems--in the Seybold Reporton Publishing Systems [see Vol.andP;  6, No.andP;  12; Vol.andP;  9, No.andP;  23; and Vol.andP;  10,No.andP;  1].)andP;  However, we have never offered in this Report a broad overview ofwhat's out there and what it can do.andP;  Now is that time.andM;What's here, what's not here.andP;  Today's OCR market comprises three majorsegments: software packages, which cost hundreds or low thousands of dollars;software-and-board packages, which have low-to-mid four-figure price tags;and integrated systems, which include scanners and run from the highthousands to the mid tens of thousands.andM;We will examine the first group of products in this article and the lattertwo groups in a forthcoming second article.andP;  There are a few exceptions tothat division.andP;  In the second article, we will look at some under-$1,000software products that work only with the vendor's scanners.andP;  We will alsotest Kurzweil's (more precisely, Xerox Imaging Systems') Freedom 386, asoftware-only offering that can work on varius scanners but weighs in at ahefty $2,995.andP;  For that much money, it should (and by most accounts does)provide features more comparable to those of hardware-based systems than tothose of its software brethren.andM;This study is intended as an introductory overview, not as a full-fledgedbuying guide.andP;  In practice, an experienced user will be able to trainprograms more thoroughly than we did and will learn how to configure thesoftware's scanner settings to get the clearest possible image; we didn'thave the luxury of weeks of working with each program.andM;If you are thinking of buying an OCR product, use this article and the laterone as a first step.andP;  Decide what sort of OCR capabilities you need, readabout the ones that fill your needs, then get demonstrations of the best onesat shows or dealers.andP;  Don't be snowed by flashy demos; bring along the kindsof documents you will need to convert to electronic form.andM;Major choices.andP;  Most OCR products work in one of two ways.andP;  The majority ofthe programs examined here are trainable; this means that the user trainsthem to read specific fonts.andP;  Generally, after a document has been scanned,the program separates out what it believes to be character images and asksthe user to identify each image.andP;  It stores each bitmap as the assignedcharacter, then matches later images against that collection of bitmaps inorder to identify characters.andM;Because of printing and scanning inconsistencies, identical bitmaps arenearly as rare as identical snowflakes.andP;  Hence, the program will identify twobitmaps that are largely but not completely similar as being the samecharacter.andP;  The better programs usually give the user some control over thedegree of similarity that is necessary for a match.andP;  Depending on the processbeing used, bitmaps that do not meet that similarity test are either shown tothe user for identification or else replaced in the output text file byeither a &quot;best guess&quot; or a placeholder character that indicates uncertainty.andM;Trainable programs tend to come with a collection of pretrained fontscovering common documents.andP;  Those fonts, and ones created by the user, can beenhanced by further training, so trainable programs generally become moreaccurate the longer they are used.andM;The second type of program is called automatic, or omnifont.andP;  Rather thanstoring bitmaps, an automatic OCR program contains knowledge about characterforms: for instance, it knows that in nearly every font, an upper-case E hasa vertical line at the left edge, with three horizontal ones extending fromit, and that a lower-case generally has a circular or oval shape with anopening at the lower right and a horizontal stroke at or slightly above itscenter.andP;  Using this knowledge, the program can identify characters in manydifferent fonts.andP;  This approach is referred to by such names as&quot;feature-matching&quot; or &quot;topological recognition.&quot;andM;An automatic program is easier to use; the user doesn't need to teach it toread.andP;  However, it is theoretically limited by its inability to improve itsrecognition.andP;  nSome automatic programs overcome this limit by letting theuser supplement their omnifont knowledge with specific character shapes.)andP;  Inpractice, a good automatic program should be accurate enough for mostapplications.andP;  (The programmers should nonetheless provide a simple way forthe user to fill in characters of which the program is uncertain.)andM;Which kind of OCR is right for you?andP;  If you do not need to convert manydocuments to electronic form, training might not be worth your time.andP;  And ifthe documents you must convert contain many different fonts, automaticprograms are more efficient.andP;  If, on the other hand, you will need to convertmany documents that share a small number of typefaces, a trainable programshould be worth your while; its accuracy will only increase over time.andM;The features you probably need.andP;  The programs described here contain manyvarieties of bells and whistles.andP;  Some will help in your application, somewon't.andP;  But some features are more universally valuable than others.andP;  Theseare the ones that we deemed especially vital:andM;* Accuracy.andP;  No matter what else it can do, if an OCR program can't recognizecharacters properly, it's useless.andP;  The more types of text it can read(typed, typeset, dot-matrix, etc.), the better.andP;  This seldom meansrecognizing them with no aid; it generally means doing so after the softwarehas been properly configured (scanner settings, font selection or training,defined zones, etc.).andM;* Speed.andP;  For obvious reasons.andM;* Intelligence.andP;  If the program can tell text from graphics, can dividedcolumns or other text blocks automatically, and can identify the order inwhich to place blocks, the user's task is lightened.andM;* Preview.andP;  The user should be able to display the scanned image (preferablyat different zoom levels) before running text recognition in order to judgethe quality of the scan and to define areas to be read or ignored.andM;* Input flexibility.andP;  The program should be able to use an image that waspreviously scanned and stored, not just a newly created one.andP;  It should alsobe able to work with pages in both portrait and landscape formats.andM;* Flag flexibility.andP;  Programs that do not make a &quot;best guess&quot; athard-to-identify characters replace them in the output text file withplaceholders (most often, the tilde).andP;  To avoid confusion with genuinecharacters in the document, the user should be able to specify theplaceholder character.andP;  Some of the programs go further by letting the useralso choose a character string to flag &quot;best guesses&quot;--characters of whichthe program is not certain, but which it places in the output text theanyway.andM;* Output flexibility.andP;  Each user may only need text files to be saved in oneformat, but to serve many users, a program should be able to save in formatsused by many different word processors.andM;* Ease of setup.andP;  A user shold be able to prepare a document to be recognizedwithout wading through endless menus.andP;  The process is made far simpler if theuser can save a group of settings, then recall them for later work.andM;* Interactivity.andP;  During the recognition process, the user should have theoption of viewing characters of which the program is uncertain, identifyingthem, and--for a trainable program--adding them to the appropriate font.andO;Some programs even let the user specify a degree of uncertainty beyond whicha character will be so shown.andM;* Touching character options.andP;  Ligatures or tightly kerned characters areoften identified as one character.andP;  In this case, the user should be able totell the program that there are multiple characters, or to separate theirscanned images and identify each as a single character.andM;* Multipage options.andP;  The program should be able to combine multiple scannedpages into one output file.andP;  Support for an automatic document feeder ratesextra points.andM;* Background or batch operation.andP;  Being albe to run the OCR process in thebackground frees the user for other tasks.andP;  We found two methods ofbackground operation: some Macintosh-based programs take advantage ofMultifinder, and some PC-based programs let the user execute a command fromthe DOS prompt.andM;* Editing options.andP;  Having run the recognition process, the user should beable to view and edit the resulting text without having to leave the OCRprogram.andP;  This can mean either having a built-in editor or offering quickaccess to the user's word processor.andP;  It should be easy to examine all thecharacters of which the program was uncertain.andM;* Hand-holding.andP;  Last but far from least, a user should be able to getassistance easily with problems or with nonintuitive features.andO;Context-sensitive online help is the user's best friend; a good manual is thebare minimum.andM;Because this review is aimed at publishers, we have focused primarily oncapabilities that would be of interest to them.andP;  There is something to besaid for a program that can perform tricks such as converting a chart intospreadsheet format or recognizing the Cyrillic alphabet.andP;  But most of ourreaders are far more interested in being able to throw a typical typed pageor a newspaper or magazine article onto a scanner and produce an accuratetext file.andM;Caere's OmniPageandM;Caere's OmniPage has been one of the most ballyhooed OCR programs since itappeared in September, 1988.andP;  Its professed abilities to recognize pageformatting, such as rows and columns, brought it quickly into the limelight.andO;Now available for Macintoshes ($795), '386 PCs ($895), and '286 PCs ($1,995with a required coprocessor board), this automatic program continues to be atopic of conversation wherever OCR software is discussed.andM;The Macintosh version of OmniPage 2.1, which we tested, requires a Mac II,SE/30 or SE (the latter requires an accelerator card) with at leasat 4 MBeach of memory and free disk space, System 4.2 or higher and Finder 5.0 orhigher.andP;  It supports scanners from Abaton, Agfa, Apple, The Complete PC,Dest, Hewlett-Packard, Microtek, Pentax, Ricoh and Siemens.andM;Text files can be saved in ASCII, MacWrite 4.5 and higher, Microsoft Word 3,Microsoft RTF, WordPerfect or Excel formats.andP;  Graphics can be saved ascompressed or uncompressed TIFF files.andM;&quot;Page recognition.&quot;andP;  After an image (portrait or landscape format) has beenscanned, the user can view it at any of eight zoom levels, from 25% to 200%,to assess the scan quality and to define the area to be recognized.andP;  Thereare only three contrast settings (darker, normal and lighter); moreflexibility here would be valuable.andM;OmniPage identifies text blocks remarkably well.andP;  On our sample Time page, itdiscarded a graphic element that began the main text block but kept the textnear it, and it discarded two large photos but kept their captions.andP;  Numbersappear in the identified text zones, indicating the order in which they willbe read; the user can change this sequence.andM;However, not even this program can properly break down all pages.andP;  We wish itwould let the user define zones, either separately or after the automaticbreakdown process.andP;  On our three-column newspaper sample, which had aheadline running across its full width, OmniPage couldn't identify the threediscrete columns until we excluded the headline from its recognition area.andM;After a document has been recognized, its text appears in an editor thatincludes search-and-replace capabilities as well as cut, copy and paste.andM;Up to 256 pages can be read into a single output text file.andP;  The program canwork with automatic document feeders on any scanner it supports directly.andM;OmniPage is fairly user-friendly.andP;  Collections of settings can be saved andreused.andP;  Online help is available, but it is not context-sensitive.andM;Optional utilities.andP;  Caere has recently developed four supplementary programsthat further enhance OmniPage's abilities.andP;  OmniDraft ($100), which enablesOmniPage to recognize draft-mode dot-matrix text, impressed us in ademonstration at Comdex this past November.andP;  We have not yet been able to trythe other three.andP;  OmniSpell ($100) adds an OCR-specific 100,000-word Americanspelling checker to the process; dictionaries are also available for mostmajor Indo-European languages.andP;  Like OmniDraft, it can work only withOmniPage version 2.1.andP;  OmniTrace ($150) converts bitmapped and TIFF imagesinto Encapsulated PostScript format, giving OmniPage the power to recognizetext and graphics.andP;  OmniProof ($150) compares two versions of any document,reporting their differences; two printed documents can be read into OmniPageand compared.andM;A sure contender.andP;  Of the programs reviewed here, only CTA's TextPert evencomes close to matching OmniPage's page recognition abilities.andP;  That mightnot matter to users who scan nothing but simple one-column pages, but itshould interest anyone who works with more complex documents.andM;Contrary to our findings at a couple of all-too-brief demonstrations at tradeshows, OmniPage's accuracy shone on our tests; it was at or near the top onall of our samples.andP;  Its speed also ranks it with the cream of this crop.andM;OmniPage isn't trainable, but unless your documents contain a lot of strangetypefaces, you will probably be pleased with its features and itsperformance.andM;Caere, 100 Cooper Ct., Los Gatos, CA 95030; phone (408) 395-7000; fax395-1994.andM;CAT's CAT ReaderandM;Computer Aided Technology's CAT Reader ($295) is the only program we reviewedthat works only with hand scaners, although a desktop version (called CATReader Professional) is slated for a late January release.andP;  It is a popularOEM product among hand scanner vendors, including The Complete PC and Nisca.andM;CAT Reader (version 1.55) works with a 10-MHz XT or faster computer, with atleast 640K of memory, running MS-DOS 3.1 or higher.andP;  It supports moststandard hand scanners.andP;  (The next version of this software for handscanners, CAT Reader 2, should appear in February.)andP;  Text can be saved inASCII (with soft returns), WordStar (3.1, 3.3 or Professional 4.0) andWordPerfect (4.1 and earlier) formats.andP;  Graphics can be saved in TIFF format.andM;Pages can be scanned either top-to-bottom or left-to-right.andP;  After performingrecognition on them, the program stitches together overlapping vertical scansto form one file.andP;  At 300 dpi, CAT Reader can handle a scanned image up toroughly 25 square inches; for large areas (whole pages, or sometimes evenwhole columns), several scans must be made, and the output text files mustthen be pieced together.andM;It offers two recognition processes: direct and interactive.andP;  In the directmode, it inserts a placeholder when it is unsure of a character.andP;  Ininteractive mode, it is pleasingly flexible: it lets the user fill in acharacter (either adding it to the font file or not), insert a placeholder,or reject the marked &quot;character&quot; (useful in cases of non-text objects).andM;Boosting accuracy.andP;  Recognition sensitivity can be set to highest, high,normal or low; this enables the user to define how certain the program shouldbe before selecting a character.andP;  The process is buttressed by a contextcorrection feature that surveys nearby characters to help it differentiatebetween similar characters such as 1/l and 0/O.andP;  Another bonus is a wordspacing adjustment: the user enters a number that tells the program how largea gap it should recognize as a word space.andM;The program comes with two font files that contain numerous common typefacesin 10- to 12-point sizes, but the manual strongly recommends building yourown.andP;  During training, CAT Reader accepts multiple characters for ligaturesand other touching characters, but the manual wisely advises the user not totrain uncommonly linked characters, because they use font file space and slowrecognition.andM;Most had scanners have built-in contrast controls.andP;  CAT Reader also offersits own ten-level contrast choice.andM;Graphics can be eliminated automatically, or the user can choose &quot;pagezoning,&quot; in which areas are defined as text to be recognized or as graphicsto be saved in TIFF format.andM;CAT Reader is fairly simple to use.andP;  Context-sensitive help for some screensis a big help.andP;  The manual has a wealth of good practical advice, forinstance: &quot;The most efficient way to build a complete font is to runInteractive OCR on the partially-built font file which contains just a fewcharacters.andP;  In this way, untrained characters can be appended onto thepartial font file while recognition is in progress.&quot;andM;Handle with care.andP;  Skew is a great problem with hand scanners.andP;  Although CATReader was advertised as handling &quot;+/-10 degrees depending on inputdocument,&quot; we had several recognition processes aborted because of skew thatexceeded the program's tolerance.andP;  Admittedly, we are not experienced handscanner users.andM;Once we had produced a readable image and &quot;trained&quot; a font, CAT Reader did anoverall commendable but not exceptional job of character recognition.andP;  It isworth a look from anyone who uses OCR only sparingly or who cannot afford afull-size scanner.andM;Computer Aided Technology, 7411 Hines Place, Suite 212, Dallas, TX 75235;phone (214) 631-6688; fax 631-4059.andM;CTA's TextPertandM;TextPert, which combines automatic and trainable operation, is joining thecrowd of OCR software that has recently become available on multipleplatforms.andP;  CTA (Ciencia i Tecnologia Aplicada, based in Barcelona) has addeda version that runs under Microsoft Windows to the original Macintoshprogram, which is what we looked at.andM;TextPert 3.01 ($995; the Windows version costs $595) runs on a Mac Plus orbetter, though CTA recommends at least a Mac II.andP;  The platform must have atleasat 1 MB of memory and 2 MB of free hard disk space.andP;  TextPert can run asa background application under Multifinder (even with only 1 MB of memory).andO;It works with scanners from Apple, Dest, Hewlett-Packard and Microtek.andM;Text files can be saved in ASCII, MacWrite or Microsoft Word formats.andO;Graphics are stored in TIFF.andP;  TextPert can import and recognize images inthese formats: TIFF (uncompressed, Pack Bits or Group 3), MacPaint, BitMap,Foto compressed, Foto noncompressed and Imag (an old file format, seldom usedtoday).andM;With or without your help.andP;  The user can either have TextPert automaticallydefine areas or define them by hand after scanning.andP;  The scanned image can beviewed at any of three levels of zoom, but even the most detailed level istoo indistrict to judge the scan quality and the need to adjust contrast orbrightness.andP;  A more detailed view of characters appears during recognition,but it would make far more sense to show the scan quality before recognitionbegan so that the user could decide then whether to rescan.andM;The number of contrast and brightness levels varies with the scanner beingused.andP;  On the HP ScanJet Plus we were using, TextPert showed only threelevels of brightness and no contrast settings; with some other scanners, itoffers more flexibility.andM;CTA describes TextPert's recognition process as a &quot;combination of artificialintelligence, feature extraction and matrix-matching.&quot;andP;  It worksautomatically, but the user can choose to train it on specific fonts, whichcan then be stored and reused in conjunction with the built-in &quot;InternalLibrary.&quot;andM;In the teaching mode, the user can tell the program to display uncertaincharacters often, seldom or with normal frequency.andP;  If TextPert's guesses ona certain type of document are accurate, the user can pick the &quot;seldom&quot;setting to speed operation; if the program is having trouble, the &quot;often&quot;setting enables the user to improve its results.andM;All uncertain characters in the final text file are represented by the bulletcharacter; the user has no choice of placeholder character.andP;  This restrictioncould cause confusion if the user modified the set of recognizable charactersto include a bullet, then used TextPert to read a document that containedbullets.andP;  A rudimentary text editor lets the user search for each bullet--orfor any other character string.andM;The user interface is a breeze for anyone with Macintosh experience.andP;  Groupsof settings can be saved and reused.andM;One of TextPert's most interesting features is optional automatic tagging.andO;Each time the original text changes typeface, size or style, the program caninsert a bracketed tag giving the new attributes.andP;  TextPert can insert thename of any font that the user has trained it to read.andP;  Some programs, suchas Aldus PageMaker and Microsoft Word, can read these tags and use theinformation in them (but only if the tags occur at the start of a paragraph).andO;Automatic tagging could also help anyone working with other compositionprograms that can use tags, although the user would have to figure out how toconvert CTA's tags for use in the composition program.andM;Among the other user-configurable settings is the option of putting a tab atthe end of each recognized area or at the end of each line, which helps inexporting text to database programs.andM;Developed in Spain, TextPert is intended for international use.andP;  There areseparate &quot;localized&quot; versions of the software for English, French, German,Italian, Spanish and Swedish.andP;  In addition, character sets are included formore than 30 languages, including such non-Roman alphabets as Cyrillic, Greekand Hebrew.andM;Ups and downs.andP;  TextPert performed unevenly in our tests.andP;  Although weexperimented with different scanner brightness settings, we couldn't get itto read our monospaced samples nearly as well as some cmopetitors.andP;  It alsodid not distinguish itself on our newspaper article, although itautomatically identified separate text areas well.andP;  When it read the Timepage, though, TextPert not only separated zones well, it also was impressivein recognizing the proportionally spaced text.andM;We noted that its failings were limited: for instance, in our monospacedCourier sample, it performed almost perfectly on all characters except &quot;r&quot;and &quot;w&quot; (and some faultily inserted spaces).andP;  By training these characters,we brought its performance up to a superior level.andP;  Similar solutionsprobably exist for most of its other problems.andM;Overall, on most of our tests, TextPert couldn't keep up, in speed or textaccuracy, with Caere's OmniPage or Datacopy's AccuText.andP;  In trade showdemonstrations, though, we have seen TextPert recognize better than it did inour testing.andP;  And we like its automatic zoning, multilanguage options andtagging capabilities.andP;  As with any program that can be trained, itsperformance would have improved if we had had more time to train it.andM;CTA, 747 Third Ave., 3rd floor, New York, NY 10017; phone (212) 935-2280; fax935-2272.andM;Essex's PC-OCRandM;Essex Software Publishing's PC-OCR is a trainable program that stands outmost for its font editor, which provides pixel-by-pixel editing of charactermatrixes.andP;  A user who enjoys fine-tuning software has much to work with here.andM;PC-OCR 1.58 ($385) runs on an XT or better with 256K of memory and DOS 2.1 orlater.andP;  It works with all full-page scanners from Hewlett-Packard, Panasonic,Princeton Graphic Systems, The Complete PC, Canon, Ricoh and QMS and somefrom Microtek.andP;  It also supports hand scanners from The Complete PC andLogitech.andM;This program is also sold as &quot;Generic OCR&quot;; that version has full recognitioncapabilities, but it lacks scanner support.andP;  Images to be recognized must becreated elsewhere, then imported.andP;  Generic OCR is notable for its low listprice: $145.andM;The software is limited in its output: it supports only ASCII (with orwithout hard returns at line endings), so no character styles can be saved.andO;Input is similarly limited: only PCX files can be used, rather than the morecommon TIFF.andM;PC-OCR comes with 20 fonts, representing a cross-section of output devicesfrom laser printers to typewriters to dot-matrix printers.andM;Operation and matrix manipulation.andP;  This is not a very user-friendly program.andO;There are neither visual aids nor pulldown menus; configuration selectionsare made by pressing the space bar, which offers in turn each possiblesetting for that feature (margin settings can be typed in directly).andM;For recognition, the user can choose one of the built-in fonts, use theauto-font mode (which picks the font closest to that in the document), orcreate a new font.andP;  In building a new font or adding to an existing one, theuser identifies each character by examining its pixel representation within a32 X 32 matrix.andP;  If that character already exists in the font, the user canreplace the existing character matrix with the new one, add the new one as asecondary image, or reject the new one.andP;  If part of the character is notvisible in the displayed matrix, the user can adjust the displayed area toview the entire character.andM;When touching characters are shown, the PC-OCR user can enter the pixelediting process and simply remove one of the characters.andP;  This solution istedious, but theoretically better than the way most other programs attackthat problem.andM;The &quot;error limit&quot;--the number of pixels by which an image can differ from astored character and still be recognized as that character--can be changedfor each character.andP;  This unique level of fine-tuning is helpful withoften-confused sets such as c/o/e.andM;The full scanned image is never displayed.andP;  To define an area to berecognized, the user must define numerical margins.andP;  These controls fall farshort of the graphical, interactive zone definition capabilities of manycompeting programs.andM;Like some other programs, PC-OCR offers context checking to make moreaccurate guesses about character pairs such as 1/l.andP;  It also provides amodifiable space constant to define the width of a word space.andM;PC-OCR can create one text file from a multipage documents, and it supportsan automatic document feeder.andM;More for techies than for tyros.andP;  In our limited experience with PC-OCR, itsaccuracy was worse than average.andP;  However, its pixel editing, error-limitsetting and other diagnostic features give the user more control over fontsthan any competitor we have tested.andP;  Tinkerers will find much of value here;casual users should probably look elsewhere.andM;Essex Software Publishing, P.O. Box 391, Cedar Grove, NJ 07009; phone (201)783-6940; fax 744-3853.andM;Flagstaff's SPOTandM;Flagstaff calls its OCR program SPOT, short for Syntactic Pattern OpticalTranslator.andP;  SPOT may be a dog's name, but its features are more reminiscentof the children in Garrison Keillor's mythical Lake Wobegon, Minnesota; theyare all above average.andM;SPOT 3.1 ($795) is a trainable program that runs on PCs with 512K of memory(Flagstaff recommends 640K), at least 1 MB of free hard disk space, and DOS3.0 or later.andP;  A mouse is also a great help in using the interface, which isbased on dropdown menus.andP;  It works with scanners from Canon, Everex,Hewlett-Packard, Kyocera, Microtek, Panasonic, Pentax, Princeton and Ricoh.andM;Text files can be saved in ASCI (with or without hard returns), DCA,WordPerfect 4 or 5, or a format called OCR Data, which is intended for use byprogrammers in extending the software's powers.andP;  Scanned images can be savedin DCX, PCX or TIF formats; images produced elsewhere in those formats can berecognized.andM;Ten fonts are built in.andP;  After scanning the document, SPOT produces a list offonts (including user-created fonts, if there are any) in order of how wellthey match what is used in the document.andP;  The user can select up to fivefonts to use in recognition.andM;Bountiful options, unique features.andP;  After scanning, the user can see apreview of the document.andP;  Two views are shown: full-page and a good zoom thatgives a clear impression of scan quality.andP;  An optional automatic zoningfeature, which can be set to ten levels of fineness, produces zones (such asfor columns) that are shown in the preview.andP;  The user can add, delete, ormodify these zones.andP;  A collection of zones can be saved for later use withsimilarly formatted documents.andM;During recognition, SPOT shows how many words it has identified, how manyzones the document contains, and which zone it is working on.andP;  If the user istraining a font, the display shows the text recognized so far, providing ahelpful context for uncertain characters.andP;  It also shows which charactershave and haven't been recognized as part of building a new font.andP;  When theprocess is done, a font editor allows corrections, and a text editor is alsoavailable.andM;Two ten-level ranges, &quot;coarse&quot; and &quot;fine,&quot; can be used to specify the amountby which a scanned character can differ from the stored image and still berecognized.andP;

 The user canchoose to eliminate any word in which no characters are recognized (likelypart of a graphic) and to ignore marks smaller, shorter or narrower than aspecified number of pixels (smudges).andM;SPOT boasts several features that are unique or nearly so.andP;  It can beconfigured to eliminate rows of periods (generally used as leader dots).andP;  Itcan read text either left-to-right or right-to-left.andP;  A DOS shell lets theuser go to DOS and perform operations there--even run other applications,such as examining a newly created text file in your favorite wordprocessor--without actually leaving SPOT (typing &quot;exit&quot; at the DOS promptinstantly returns the SPOT screen).andM;Few false leads.andP;  Once trained, SPOT did well.andP;  While it lagged slightlybehind a few other programs (but was better than most) in the number ofcharacters it identified correctly, it was among the best at avoiding falserecognitions.andM;SPOT is not the clear leader in many categories, but its overall blend ofsophisticated configurability, innovative features and ease of use make it afinalist for most common OCR applications.andM;Flagstaff Engineering, 1120 Kaibab Lane, Flagstaff, AZ 86001;

 Because ReadStar VI had not yet beenreleased (it is due in the first half of 1990), we looked at III Plus andExpress.andP;  They are so similar, except for III Plus's trainability, that wewill refer to them as one.andM;ReadStar III Plus and Express will run on an AT or PS/2 system with 640K ofmemory and a hard disk.andP;  (ReadStar II Plus, a trainable program, is availableto Macintosh users.)andP;  ReadStar's popdown menus can be operated with a mouseor keypad.andP;  It will drive scanners from Microtek, Hewlett-Packard, Agfa,Panasonic and IBM.andM;Text files can be saved directly in ASCII format, with or without underliningflagged.andP;  With an included utility program (usable only after an ASCII filehas been created), files can be &quot;transcoded&quot; for use with Microsoft Word,WordPerfect, WordStar 3.30, 3.40 and 2000, Volkswriter, Spellbinder,PageMaker, Ventura Publisher, Framework and Wang systems.andP;  No characterstyles (such as bold or italic) are transferred to these files.andP;  Scannedimages can be saved in MSP (Microsoft Paint) format, which is the onlygraphic format that ReadStar can read; a version due in mid-January will beable to work with TIFF as well.andM;Utilities to the rescue.andP;  The software works with portrait or landscapedocuments.andP;  It can automatically eliminate graphics and recognize columns.andO;There is no prescan, but the user has two ways to select areas to berecognized or excluded.andP;  An included utility, RSWin, enables the user toselect up to ten windows graphically after a prescan.andP;  The other method iswonderfully low-tech: the user picks &quot;exclusion by marker&quot; or &quot;selection bymarker&quot; from a menu, then uses a heavy felt-tip pen to outline the specialareas.andP;  In some ways this is simpler than computer-assisted zoning, but thereis the obvious drawback that not everyone wants to have ink slapped onto adocument.andM;The user can judge the quality of a scan by opting to see &quot;models&quot; (distinctcharacter shapes) as they are identified by the program.andP;  If the models lookbadly formed, the user can abort the recognition process and rescan.andM;Other options include a selectable character to represent unrecognizedobjects (characters), multiple levels of contrast and brightness (3 and 14,respectively, on the HP ScanJet Plus), and the ability to recognize verticallines used in tables.andP;  A collection of options can be saved and recalled forlater use.andM;During recognition, the program displays the number of models found, thetotal number of objects found and the percentage of redundancy (basically,what proportion of characters fit existing models).andM;In training and semi-automatic modes, it shows a character shape and lets theuser define that character, cancel the to six characters can be entered torepresent one &quot;object.&quot;andP;  This process is admirably flexible.andM;Context analysis is performed on frequently confused character sets.andP;  Thesame utility that prepares ASCII files for various word processors alsoprovides a module that performs spelling checking and correction during therecognition process.andP;  It then offers an editing mode in which the user hasaccess to a search function; the ability to stop on corrected words, initialcapitals and hyphens; and several other aids.andM;The program takes some getting used to.andP;  It has a habit, at various points inthe recognition process, of leaving the screen unchanged for what seems likea long time.andP;  The user will soon learn when this is just a processing delayand when (as on a couple of occasions) it means a hung system.andM;Inovatic's help function deserves kudos.andP;  It provides a good explanation ofwhatever option or feature is highlighted.andP;  Also noteworthy is the ability towork in inches or millimeters (the software has European roots).andM;Like some competitors, ReadStar offers a DOS shell.andP;  It lets the user jump toDOS, perform DOS functions or run other programs, then just type &quot;exit&quot; andpop back into ReadStar.andM;Reasonable performance, wrong price.andP;  In our tests, ReadStar finished aroundthe middle of the pack in accuracy and speed.andP;  It sometimes had troublerecognizing columns.andM;The strong OCR programs available for less than $1,000 make Inovatic'spricing look strange.andP;  Perhaps III Plus's price tag could be justified if itstood far above the crowd, but it had no features special enough to make itworth a cool two grand.andP;  Furthermore, Inovatic is the only company in ourtesting that uses a dongle for copy protection.andP;  Dongles are common inmulti-thousand-dollar software, but in programs intended for mass-marketconsumption, they are a dying breed.andM;We have seen Inovatic's software on several occasions, and it has always wonour respect.andP;  But some other competitors are moving ahead quickly, and ifInovatic doesn't make its ReadStar line more flexible and easier to use(e.g., with an editable prescan), it will slip farther from a leading role.andM;Inovatic, 1911 North Fort Myer Dr., Suite 708, Arlington, VA 22209;

 by Moniterm.andP;  Inaddition to the trainable OCR program Image-In Read ($349), the Image-In linecontains Image-In Scan + Paint ($149), which combines scanner drivingsoftware with a paint program; Image-In Vect ($349), a raster-to-vectorconversion program; and Image-In Plus ($349), a gray-scale image processingpackage.andP;  All of these programs run under Microsoft Windows; in order for anyof the others to work, Image-In Scan + Paint must be installed.andP;  A completepackage of all four modules is available for $795.andM;Image-In Read runs on a '286-based or faster PC running DOS 3.1 or later andWindows 2.03 or later, with 512K of memory, a hard disk and a mouse.andP;  It usesthe Image-In Scan scanner drivers, which support the Logitech ScanMan handscanner as well as full-page models from Canon, HP, Microtek and Ricoh.andM;Text files can be saved in the Windows character set or ASCII, with orwithout hard returns at line endings.andP;  Using Image-In Scan + Paint, graphicfiles can be saved in Gem Paint, EyeStar, MacPaint, Microsoft Paint, PCPaintbrush, Windows Bitmap, Windows/PM bitmap, Encapsulated PostScript orTIFF format.andP;  Files in all of those formats can be brought in forrecognition.andM;Landscape-format images can be rotated by the Scan + Paint module so that theRead module can perform recognition.andP;  Rotation makes demands on memory,though; our half-page dot-matrix document couldn't be rotated on our 640Kmachine.andM;To learn or not to learn.andP;  Image-In Read is fairly user-friendly, especiallyfor experienced Windows users.andP;  The program's context-sensitive help is awelcome feature.andM;After the initial scan, both a full-page and a zoom view are shown, enablingthe user to see the scan quality and to frame areas for recognition.andP;  A setof frames, called a mask, can be saved and reused.andM;Recognition can be performed either interactivety (&quot;learn mode&quot;) or with nouser input.andP;  Once a non-learning recognition is finished, the program canbring up in turn every instance where a placeholder was used in place of anunrecognized character.andP;  In learn mode, the program displays a blow-up ofeach unrecognized character as well as a smaller view of the text it hasrecognized so far (see photo), giving the user a context for identifyingthose characters.andM;While it is recognizing, the program constantly updates a display showing thenumber of characters it has read, the number unrecognized and the recognitionpercentage.andP;  Ligatures and other touching characters are handled by enteringtwo characters.andM;Some programs offer context checking to differentiate between similarcharacters such as S and 5.andP;  Image-In Read takes a less automatic but morecertain approach: the user can define up to five characters on which therecognition process will stop so that the user can fill in the propercharacter.andP;  If, for instance, the 1 and l in a certain font are being falselyrecognized, the user can have the program stop each time it encounters acharacter that it identifies as either of those two.andM;An &quot;append to file&quot; command permits one file to be assembled from a multipagedocument.andM;Integration is the key.andP;  Image-In Read did an adequate job on most of ourtests; it had more trouble than most of its competitors with thenear-letter-quality dot-matrix sample.andP;  A couple of times, the programinserted word spaces in between every pair of characters on a line.andP;  Allother lines of those documents were recognized properly, without the faultyword spaces.andP;  The program's speed put it near the middle of the pack.andM;The biggest benefit we can see of Image-In Read is its tight integration withthe other Image-In modules.andP;  It might seem troubling to be forced to buy theScan + Paint module just to run the Read program, but the combined price ofthese two packages ($498) is less than the price of many standalone OCRprograms.andP;  In fact, the full Image-In package, at $795, is well within therange of programs reviewed here.andP;  We didn't examine the other Image-Inmodules closely, but if you do a lot of graphics work in addition to textwork, perhaps you should consider this package.andM;Moniterm, 5740 Green Circle Dr., Minnetonka, MN 55343;

 Advanced Vision Research is the first major OEM,offering a version of ReadPro (which it calls Tiger OCR) bundled with itsscanners.andM;ReadPro 1.3 ($595) runs on a '286-based or faster PC.andP;  The program needsaccess to 640K of memory (&quot;2 MB preferred&quot;), a 20-MB hard disk, DOS 3.1 orlater, Microsoft Windows 2.1 or later (a runtime version is included with thepackage) and a mouse.andP;  It can drive scanners from Advanced Vision Research,AST, Canon, Dest, Hewlett-Packard, Kyocera, Microtek, Panasonic, Taxan andUmax.andP;  (Ricoh scanners will be supported in the next version.)andM;Text files can be saved in the Windows character set or ASCII (with orwithout hard line-ending returns) as well as WordStar or WordPerfect formats.andO;Images are saved as TIFF files.andP;  ReadPro can work with both portrait andlandscape documents.andM;Flexible image and text options.andP;  An image can be scanned at any of threecontrast settings.andP;  ReadPro's image editor also offers the ability to cut,paste, copy and crop portions of the image.andM;After a prescan, the user can define multiple regions on a page (up to 99,far more than with most competitors).andP;  They can be reordered; a numberappears in the corner of each, showing where in the sequence it falls.andP;  Theimage can be viewed at any of three zoom levels, giving a good idea of thequality of the scan.andM;By combining the choice between full or partial page recognition and the onebetween WYSIWYG or left-justified mode, the user can produce any of fourformats in the output document.andP;  Partial page allows the user to specifywhich defined areas to read.andP;  For multicolumn documents, WYSIWYG mode willpreserve the columns.andP;  The program can also differentiate between text andgraphics.andM;ReadPro comes with several common pretrained fonts, plus fonts used in manyof the leading computer magazines.andP;  (We don't feel terribly slighted by thelack of a &quot;Seybold&quot; font in ReadPro.)andM;The user can set &quot;recognition control&quot; at tight, normal or loose, alteringthe certainty threshold below which ReadPro identifies a character asquestionable by placing a tilde in the output text file.andP;  This helpfulfeature lets the user trade speed (in terms of not having to fill inquestionable characters by hand) for accuracy, depending on the clarity ofthe original document.andM;During recognition, the user can enter normal characters or ASCII or hexvalues.andP;  In learning mode, one mouse click brings up an extended ASCII tablefrom which the user can select the proper character.andP;  Characters can beentered with or without being trained, and lines of &quot;noise&quot; can be skippedeasily.andM;The user can enter a string of characters when a ligature is encountered anddisplayed.andP;  ReadPro also enables the user to separate touching characters andidentify each as a separate character.andM;When recognition is finished, the text file can be viewed in a built-ineditor that includes search-and-replace capability.andP;  The user can also edit alearned font to correct faultily identified characters.andP;  A statisticalsummary can be called up to show the number of characters, how many wereunrecognized and the recognition percentage.andM;ReadPro includes some niceties that should be standard in OCR programs.andO;Multipage documents can be converted to a single file (with different areasdefined on each page if desired), and the program supports an automaticdocument feeder.andM;The interface is as simple to use as one would expect from its MicrosoftWindows (or Macintosh) environment.andP;  Setup files can be saved and recalledfor later use.andM;Not exceptional, but a solid start.andP;  ReadPro did not distinguish itself fromthe competition in our speed and accuracy tests, but neither did itdisappoint.andP;  Its collection of features is better than middle-of-the-road.andO;While we found no overriding reason to recommend ReadPro, it struck us asbeing very solid, especially considering its newness.andP;  Like the othertrainable programs we tested, it would gain accuracy over time as the userenhanced recognition of specific fonts.andM;Ocron has made a promising start.andP;  With the initial stages of productdevelopment and release behind it, the company can now concentrate on pushingReadPro's speed, accuracy and features further ahead.andM;Ocron, 3350 Scott Blvd., Bldg.andP;

 This automatic(omnifont) program enjoys a long heritage, being rooted in large-scaledocument recognition systems the firm has produced since its founding in1969.andM;ReadRight 2.01 runs on a PC or PS/2 with 640K of memory (of which at least575,000 bytes must be free--a stern test for systems with TSR programs), atleast 1.5 MB available on a hard disk, and DOS 3.0 or higher.andP;  It can rununder Microsoft Windows/286 or /386, but it doesn't have to.andP;  It directlysupports full-page scanners from Abaton, AST, Canon, Chinon, The Complete PC,Hewlett-Packard, Kyocera, Microtek, Panasonic, Pentax, Ricoh, Taxan and Umax,as well as hand scanners from The Complete PC and Logitech.andP;  It can also readgraphics in PCX or TIFF (uncompressed, Modified Group3 [commonly used forfaxes], or PackBits) formats.andM;OCR Systems has gone a few extra miles to make ReadRight attractive to a wideaudience.andP;  It can create text files in many formats: WordPerfect 4.2 and 5.0,Microsoft Word, WordStar, XyWrite, CanoWriter, DCA-RFT, dBase Mail List,Lotus 1-2-3, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft RTF and five flavors of ASCII(altering variables such as hard vs.andP;  soft returns, and comma-delimited filesfor atabase and mail merge applications).andP;  It can save graphics as TIFF orPCX.andM;A friendly design.andP;  User-friendliness is partly subjective, but from themoment we sat down with ReadRight, we found it a joy to work with.andP;  The menusare efficient and well laid out; the recognition process requires no userintervention nthough vendors of trainable software might say it allows nouser intervention) and the manual is clear and informative.andP;  Anyone who isscared of computers has very little to fear here.andM;The main menu (see photo) presents a list of options.andP;  Pressing the indicatedfunction key brings up a list of available settings or enables the user toinput a measurement (such as paper length).andP;  A group of settings can be savedand reloaded later.andM;During recognition, the recognized words are displayed above the main menu.andO;A highlighted bar shows the portions of the entire document that have beenscanned and read.andP;  The user can define a placeholder symbol to be used forunrecognized characters.andM;When recognition is finished, ReadRight writes the file to disk.andP;  It does notprovide an editor, but it provides immediate access to the user's wordprocessor--a boon to anyone who believes that one text editor is enough tolearn.andM;The user can choose whether the output text file should retain attributes,which include bold, underlining, changes in font sizes, and differencesbetween serif and sans serif fonts.andP;  At the Seybold Computer PublishingConference in September, we saw a prerelease version that could actually namethe font and size used in a document.andP;  This feature, due for a Januaryrelease, will initially be programmed for about 40-50 fonts; not all wordprocessors will be able to use the font information it provides.andM;There are five contrast settings.andP;  After performing a prescan, the user cangraphically set a frame to define the area to be read.andP;  Setting the frame iseasy, but it would be nice to be able to see the prescan image at higher zoomlevels; it's hard to tell what areas the frame will affect.andP;  There is ahigher-resolution display available through the utilities menu, which helpsdetermine the quality of a scan, but it cannot be used to create a frame.andM;Unlike some competitors, ReadRight shows the coordinates of a defined frame.andO;The program can be set up to use inches or centimeters in all itsmeasurements.andM;ReadRight can assemble a multipage document into a file, and it supports anautomatic document feeder.andP;  However, the frame cannot be redefined betweenpages.andM;Like a small number of competing programs, ReadRight lets the user run DOSapplications without fully leaving the program.andP;  ReadRight can also be run inbatch mode from the DOS command line using any existing settings file.andM;The user can tell ReadRight to keep a column format or not to.andP;  If &quot;retaincolumns&quot; is set to &quot;no,&quot; the program automatically deletes all line-endinghyphens.andP;  This is a handy option to have, even though there are cases where auser would want to retain some of those hyphens.andM;Passign our tests.andP;  ReadRight's accuracy on typical fonts was not the verybest, but it was clearly among the leaders.andP;  On half a page of monospacedCourier, it made only two errors.andP;  In a 300-word dot-matrix printout, onlysix errors.andP;  In half a page from Time mgazine, only 12 words neededcorrecting.andP;  It's fairly fast, too: for instance, scanning and recognizingthe dot-matrix text (which was in NLQ mode, but not very sharply printed)took less than 1-1/2 minutes on our 10-MHa '286 machines.andM;ReadRight impressed us in virtually all areas.andP;  If the documents you need toscan are of reasonably good quality and don't contain exotic character sets,and if you are a PC user who doesn't relish the thought of teaching acomputer to read, this is a must-see.andM;OCR Systems, 1800 Byberry Rd., Suite 1405, Huntingdon Valley, PA 19006;

 Recently,though, it ported Read-It to the Microsoft Windows environment, which iswhere we put it through its paces.andM;Read-It 1.1 ($495) runs on a '286-based or faster OC with Windows 2.1 orlater, 640K of memory (at least 250K of which must be available to theprogram), a hard disk with at least 1 MB free, a mouse and any PC scannerthat can produce standard TIFF or PCX files.andM;Text can be saved only in ASCII format, so no character attributes can bestored.andP;  Scanned images are saved in TIFF format; the program can also readfrom TIFF, PCX and CCITT files created elsewhere.andP;  Read-It can work only withportrair-format images.andP;  Three main types of recognition are offered:Recognize (using existing fonts), Learn (to build new fonts), and Recognizeand Learn (to enhance existing fonts).andP;  Read-It comes with 17 specificbuilt-in fonts plus a &quot;hint&quot; font that has some universal characteristics.andM;Making learning easy.andP;  The EasyLearn feature is one that other vendors shouldemulate.andP;  Read-It includes a special text file; if the user can output it onthe printer used to create a document, that font can be &quot;trained&quot; with nouser intervention.andM;After a prescan, the image can be viewed at any of four zoom levels, which isvery helpful for assessing scan quality.andP;  The user graphically defines theareas for character recognition.andP;  Multiple zones can be defined; they areprocessed in the order in which they were defined.andM;When recognition is in progress, the program shows what step it isperforming--analyzing the image, separating lines, separating characters,etc.--and what portion of that step is complete.andM;If the program is uncertain of a character, it inserts its best guess.andP;  Atthe end of the recognition process, it displays (in addition to the number ofcharacters in the document) an &quot;average matching errors&quot; figure, which ituses to grade the result very good, good, fair or inadequate.andM;Read-It keeps track of how often each entry in a type table has been matchedto characters in documents.andP;  The user can have seldom-used entries deletedautomatically, thereby reducing the type table and speeding operation.andM;A &quot;continuous recognize&quot; mode is used to handle multipage documents.andO;Unortunately, this mode can only recognize the same area on each page, as informs work, the user cannot set up different areas on pages within the samedocument, which would be necessary in many applications.andP;  The program doessupport automatic document feeders.andM;Look to the future.andP;  Read-It's accuracy and speed were respectable, and ithas some valuable special features, such as EasyLearn and automatictype-table reduction.andP;  However, it lacks many desirable extensions, though weare told that some--such as more output format flexibility and automaticcolumn recognition--are in development.andM;Overall, Read-It is worth a look from Mac or Windows users, especially thoseon a low budget.andM;Olduvai, 7520 Red Rd., Suite A, South Miami, FL 33143;

there are also versions for use withfull-sized scanners.andM;CARETS/By Hand Deluxe (&quot;CARETS&quot; for the purposes of this article) runs on anyPC with 640K of memory, a hard disk and MS-DOS 3.0 or later, though PatternAnalytics recommends a '286 or faster CPU.andP;  It drives DFI, Logitech, KYE[Geniscan] and The Complete PC 4&quot;, 300-or-more-dpi scanners.andM;Text files can be saved in these formats: WordStar, WordPerfect, Volkswriter3, Multimate, RFT (DCA), Xywrite, PC-Write, Microsoft Word and a handful ofASCII configurations (in which the user can make such choices as whether ornot to insert hard returns for line endings and to follow paragraphs with ablank line).andP;  It can work with imported files in TIFF (compressed oruncompressed), CCITT Group 3 fax and PCX formats.andM;The developers have made an effort to cross national boundaries: CARETSincorporates default character sets for all European-language keyboardssupported by DOS 3.0, namely US/UK, German, French, Italian, Spanish, andSwiss German.andM;CARETS comes with 12 general-purpose fonts, ranging from typesetting fonts todraft mode dot-matrix ones, and with three specific ones: those used in themagazines U.S.andP;  News and World Report, Scientific American and Byte.andM;Good options, weird interface.andP;  Upon starting up CARETS, we were greeted bythe strangest-looking, most confusing user interface we encountered in thisgroup (see photo).andP;  So man software developers try to stand out from theboring, ordinary interfaces, but there are reasons for the ordinariness ofthese interfaces--they are good ones!andP;  A regular user of CARETS would soonlearn how to set up the program for a job, but probably not as quickly oreasily as with, say, a program that used familiar pulldown menus.andM;The program's other screens are also initially hard to navigate, and the usermanual we had provided precious little guidance.andM;Part of that lost user-friendliness is, however, regained by the inclusion ofmany training sheets used in the program's tutorials.andP;  By following thosedirections, a user can accelerate the learning process.andM;CARETS can work with images up to seven inches wide.andP;  Image width can bespecified numerically before the scan.andP;  While scanning, the program writesthe TIFF file to disk, so system memory isn't a limitation.andM;When reading faxes and other documents typically produced at 200 dpi, CARETSautomatically rescales its 300-dpi fonts to 200 dpi.andM;Unknown characters are marked with a symbol of the user's choice.andP;  The usercan also choose to mark questionable characters--those for which the programhas inserted its best guess, but that exceed an error threshold.andP;  The lattercapability is a valuable addition that far too many OCR programs lack.andO;CARETS' text editor also offers two nice ways of handling questionablecharacters: one function key causes all of them to flash, and anotherfunction key moves the cursor to the next one in sequence.andM;Another bonus is that CARETS can be run in batch mode from the DOS prompt,which is made possible by the ability to save and reuse sets ofconfigurations.andM;CARETS is especially strong in treating joined characters.andP;  Rather thantraining the program to read one object as multiple characters, which someother programs do, cARETS lets the user separate joined charactersautomatically.andP;  This doesn't always lead to the proper separation, but if itdoesn't, another function--one that joins broken characters--is likely to fixthe damage.andM;Working by hand: pros and cons.andP;  Like the other hand-scanner-based programreviewed here, CAT Reader, CARETS lagged most of the full-page-scannerprograms in accuracy, but that is at least partly due to our lack ofexperience with hand scanners.andP;  In demonstrations we have seen at tradeshows, folks who worked for hand scanner vendors have been able to producefar better-looking document images than we usually could.andP;  (And remember thatthere are also versions of CARETS for full-page scanners.)andP;  Furthermore,CARETS' performance using its pretrained Byte font on a sample from thatmagazine showed that longer-term training can produce clear improvements.andM;If you are a skilled hand scanner user, or plan to become one, then thesemighty mites are suitable for low-volume OCR.andP;  If you need to convert a lotof documents to electronic form, though, and if you can afford it, take ouradvice (and that of more than one hand-scanner vendor we've talked with): geta full-page model.andM;Pattern Analytics, P.O.

 The original developer continues to enchance TextScan'sfunctionality.andM;TextScan 3.0 ($395) runs on a Macintosh Plus or better with at least 1 MB ofmemory (the manual recommends 2 MB).andP;  It drives scanners from Canon,Princeton Graphic Systems, QMS, apple, Sharp and Fujitsu, along with anyother Maccompatible scanner that generates compressed TIFF files.andM;Output text files can only be saved in ASCII format, with or without &quot;wordwrap&quot; (deletion of hard returns and line-ending hyphens).andP;  Such a limitedoutput capability hampers anyone who needs to convert documents with textmodes intact.andM;Omnifont with editable libraries.andP;  The user can use a zoomable display todefine sections to be read or deleted from the image.andP;  Zones are read in theorder in which they were defined.andM;Although it is an omnifont (automatic) program, TextScan also lets the userinteractively &quot;teach&quot; it hard-to-identify characters.andP;  The user can save afont thus constructed, improving performance on frequently seen fonts.andM;Context checking improves the recognition of easily confused character pairs;this checking takes place two lines ahead of the identified text that isvisible on the screen, so when an uncertain character is brought up in itsseparate window, the user can only see a few characters around it.andP;  The usercan, however, define a word or larger portion of text in the output text filewindow and pop it up, in zoomed mode, in the character identification window.andM;TextScan's handling of misrecognized characters is note-worthy.andP;  Whilerecognition is under way, the user can correct any character that has beenfalsely identified.andP;  Typing a character brings up all objects that have beenrecognized as that character; by choosing a wrongly identified on and typingthe proper character, the user can correct all instances of that object inthe document.andM;The user can specify how many word spaces should be converted to a tab.andM;As words are completed, they are compared with a &quot;common words&quot; dictionary ora larger, 40,000-word one.andP;  A complete file can be checked with the &quot;checkspelling&quot; function, which allows the user to add words to the dictionary.andM;The recognized text is displayed, but it is not editable; the user must exitTextScan and call up a word processor.andP;  Multiple pages can be combined intoone output text file.andM;Under new management.andP;  TextScan did not stand out in any of our recognitiontests, and it had particular difficulty with tightly kerned text that some ofits higher-priced competitors handled well.andP;  Still, the program's combinationof automatic and trainable recognition makes it interesting, and it acquitteditself well against other programs in its price range.andM;We will be interested to see what sort of improvements Prism makes in thesoftware, which it has only recently acquired.andM;Prism Enterprises, 14703-E Baltimore Ave., Suite 248, Laurel, MD 20707;

 This heritage shows inDatacopy's automatic (omnifont) AccuText software.andM;AccuText runs on a Macintosh SE (with accelerator card), SE/30 or member ofthe II series, with at least 4 MB of memory, a hard disk, System 6.0 orlater, and Finder 6.1 or later or Multifinder (which requires at least 5 MBof memory).andP;  It drives Apple, Datacopy, Hewlett-Packard and Microtekscanners.andM;Text files can be saved in MacWrite, RTF, Excel and ASCII (with or withouthard returns) formats.andP;  Graphics can be saved as TIFF (uncompressed, PackBitsor CCITT-3), MacPaint or PICT files.andP;  The program words with both portraitand landscape images; it can also recognize TIFF files created elesewhere.andM;Pictures and words.andP;  On an optional preview screen, the user can graphicallydefine areas for recognition and link them in any order.andP;  Five zoom levelsbring precision to this process and to the task of making the best scan.andO;Text and image zones are specified separately.andP;  For easy reference, imageareas are automatically saved under names that contain the name of the outputtext file.andM;AccuText can automatically detect columns, but the manual recommends thatthis feature only be used on documents with columns of different widths.andP;  Forcolumns of similar widths, the user is advised to specify the number ofcolumns (up to four) and the total page width.andP;  If this number of columnsspecified, AccuText can still read the text, but the output file will containtext fields separated by tabs, rather than combined in linear fashion.andP;  Theneed to enter the number of columns is a jarring note in a program where somany functions work automatically.andP;  Like all other AccuText measurements, itcan be entered in inches or centimeters.andM;Below a certain level of certainty, AccuText inserts a placeholder, which theuser can choose.andP;  although the user cannot change this certainty threshold,the program does let users specify a character or group of characters toappear next to &quot;questionable&quot; characters.andP;  This ability makes it far easierto find misidentified characters; we'd like to see it in other programs.andM;By gradually reversing the display of the scanned image, AccuText shows howfar along it is.andP;  The user can also choose to view each word and line as itis recognized.andP;  The words and lines do not appear in the same order as in thedocument, but this display gives a good idea of recognition accuracy: if manymisidentified characters appear, the user can cancel recognition and rescanwith different settings.andM;Collections of settings can be saved and reused.andP;  They include informationranging from scan brightness to placeholder and &quot;questionable character&quot;markers to number of columns (or automatic column detection).andM;AccuText shines in its multipage document features.andP;  Not only can the programbuild one output file from multiple input pages, it can even read, then orderand number correctly pages that are fed through an automatic document feederas a stack of verso pages, then inverted and fed again as a reverse-orderedstack of rectos.andP;  This kind of capability clearly separates a program meantfor large jobs from one aimed mainly at single-page and other shortdocuments.andM;Another rare feature of AccuText is an option that places a user-defined codeat the start of each new zone (column or other marked area).andP;  The user canalso request &quot;zone position codes&quot; that specify the precise placement anddimensions of each zone on the page.andP;  This information won't matter to someusers, but those who want to recreate a page layout will treasure it.andM;What AccuText lacks in font learning, it more than makes up for inintelligence and speed.andP;  Its feature-based recognition method worked well onthe common fonts we tried, and a dictionary and plentiful configurablesettings polish the process even more.andP;  The recognition process acceleratesas the program gains more information about the font, spacing and so forth;in a multipage document, speed can increase significantly.andM;As text is recognized, it is compared with a built-in 50,000-word lexicon,which holds not only words but also context-checking aids such as informationabout prefixes, suffixes, ligature pairs and kern pairs.andP;  These lexicons areavailable in eight languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish,Dutch, Swedish and Norwegian.andP;  Users may create additional dictionaries of upto 10,000 words each.andM;Our impressions.andP;  A typed page of 10-point Courier was recognized with only asingle error--the deletion of a &quot;--&quot; sequence at the end of a paragraph.andP;  Ontests involving proportionally spaced text, it fared worse, but still wellenough that the necessary runs through the resulting files with a spellingchecker were quick.andM;Recognition speed depends largely on the type of text and the scan quality.andO;While it took about two minutes to process a half page from Time (on aMacintosh IIx), AccuText raced through the full page of Courier in less thana minute.andP;  Even allowing for differences in platfform power, it is clearlyone of the fastest programs we tested.andM;What's not to like about this program?andP;  Very little.andP;  Its lack oftrainability might limit its long-run accuracy in comparison to the very besttrainable programs, but unless you need to convert unusual fonts, it willprocess must of your documents in a quick and friendly manner.andP;  It alsohandles stacks of input pages better than any other program reviewed here.andO;Before you buy any other OCR software for your Mac, try a sample document onAccuText.andM;Xerox Imaging Systems, 535 Oakmead Pkwy., Sunnyvale, CA 94086;
