Live hog futures initially traded lower, but responded tothe rally in pork bellies to close higher for the day.</LP><TEXT>   Pork belly futures for July delivery closed up two cents apound at 69.75 cents on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, andJuly hogs closed up 0.77 cent a pound at 63.10 cents.   &quot;We're within shooting distance of the contract high of71.60&quot; cents a pound for the July pork belly contract, saidJerry Abbenhaus, a futures analyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sonsin St. Louis.   Pork bellies shipped from warehouses outside of Chicago tomeatpacking plants totaled as much as three million pounds,said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp.,Arlington Heights, Ill. That's nearly three times the amountthat would normally be shipped in a week this time of yearfrom outside of Chicago warehouses as well as those in theChicago area, Mr. Morgan said.   Summertime demand accounted for a portion of the increasein shipments, as did relatively light hog slaughtersrecently, analysts said. Prices for fresh pork belliesrecently exceeded prices for frozen bellies, which alsofueled the belly futures price increase, analysts said.

The July contract dropped $54a metric ton to $1,181, as speculators liquidated positionstaken in an effort to capitalize on the political upheavalsin the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer.Despite earlier concerns, the upheaval &quot;didn't affect cocoaor alter the overwhelming supply situation that had been sucha depressant on price previously,&quot; said William O'Neill ofMerrill Lynch Futures in New York. As this becomes clearer,he said, prices are &quot;simply reflecting the prevailingconditions.&quot; Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton,said there was little market support for cocoa prices&quot;because dealers had bought significant quantities of thebeans earlier when prices were lower, and they have littleincentive to buy at this time.&quot; At the same time, she said,rain in West Africa has improved crop prospects there, andthe Brazil summer crop will soon be arriving on the market --both factors that depress prices, she said. Ms. Kaul alsocited continuing concern that the Soviet Union, because ofcredit problems, may have to forgo accepting delivery ofcocoa it has previously bought. If that happened, the cocoacould end up being offered for sale on the world market, shesaid.                                                                                                          ENERGY: U.S. crude prices for July closed slightly higherafter traders seemed to digest, but disregard, severaltidbits of news. A fire continued to burn aboard a Norwegiantanker in the Gulf of Mexico, but the market apparentlyaccepted Coast Guard predictions that the tanker, which has38.2 million gallons of light crude, wouldn't sink. Priceswere apparently hurt in the U.S. and in Asia by reports thatJapan, a large petroleum importer, is counting on significantadditional discounts from some members of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries. Meanwhile, Exxon Corp. said itwould reopen its Linden, N.J., refinery by mid-July; Norway'soil workers threatened to strike July 1, and a major Alaskanpipeline will be closed today so that corrosion can berepaired. Traders took all the news in and the result wasthat West Texas Intermediate -- like crudes for the Julycontract closed on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $16.82a barrel, up four cents a barrel. Products finished thesession lower.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices declined in the wake of news thatthe second of three major U.S. copper mining companies hadreached a new labor agreement. The July contract ended with aloss of 2.10 cents a pound at $1.0965. A spokesman for PhelpsDodge Corp., in Phoenix, Ariz., said the company had come toa tentative agreement with the United Steelworkers union; therank and file will vote on the new contract today. Late lastmonth, Kennecott Corp., a Salt Lake City unit of RTZ ofBritain, reached an accord. This leaves Asarco Inc. of NewYork as the last major U.S. mining company yet to reach a newagreement. The U.S. labor pacts run out on June 30. The talksbetween managements and the union have been progressingharmoniously, according to analysts, but even so, the earlysettlement by Phelps Dodge came as a surprise, they said. ThePhelps Dodge agreement diminishes the prospect of supplydisruptions because of labor problems and enhances thepossibility that a pact with Asarco will soon be reached,analysts said. They estimated that the London Metal Exchangetoday will announce an increase of 3,000 to 5,000 tons inwarehouse supplies of copper. More ample inventories of themetal and a slowing U.S. economy, which could reduce demand,remain price-depressing factors and contributed to anarrowing of the premium of soonest-to-expire deliveries overmore deferred contracts both in New York and London, theysaid.                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Analysts are divided over whether theAgriculture Department will lower its one-month-old estimateof the winter wheat harvest under way in the U.S. In May, thedepartment forecast the harvest at 2.09 billion bushels, up44% from the drought-damaged 1989 harvest. Some analysts arespeculating that recent heavy rains damaged the soft redvariety grown in Illinois and Indiana. Others, however, areprojecting that the hard red variety grown in the SouthernPlains is in better condition than indicated in May. Based onJune 1 conditions, Richard Feltes, director of research atRefco Inc., Chicago, said he expects a winter wheat harvestof 2.14 billion bushels. Susan Leighty, a grain analyst atPrudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York, is predicting aharvest of 2.12 billion bushels. The Agriculture Departmentis also slated to update its supply and demand estimates forcorn and soybeans. Among other things, analysts expect thegovernment to begin trimming its rough estimate that therecently planted corn crop could total 8.1 billion bushels atharvest this fall. An unusually wet spring prevented manyfarmers from planting as many acres as the government hadexpected. Some crop analysts, however, are projecting a cornharvest of 7.4 billion to 7.7 billion bushels.</TEXT></DOC>
