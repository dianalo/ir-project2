Audrey McLaughlin, who chose American singer Tracy Chapman's``Talking 'bout a Revolution'' as her theme song at the party'sconvention this month, was elected leader on the fourth ballot.   ``I stand for change,'' she said. ``I want to change Canada. ... Let's seize the future and not the past.''   The 53-year-old latecomer to federal politics from the sparselypopulated Yukon succeeds Ed Broadbent, who retired after 14 yearsas leader of the New Democratic Party.   His credibility and personal popularity had brought hopes forsignificant gains before the November 1988 national election, butthe hopes failed to materialize.   Even so, a Gallup poll taken two months before the convention inWinnipeg, Manitoba, found that 47 percent of Canadians believed theNew Democrats would be hurt by losing Broadbent as leader. Twentypercent said his departure would help the party and 15 percent saidit would have no effect.   Broadbent delivered a farewell speech that listed policies hesaid would be in keeping with the party's social democratictradition.   Among them were an end to child poverty, a softening of what hecalled the market economy's harsh impact, a diversion of militaryspending to aid for the Third World and a tougher approach toenvironmental protection that would include jail sentences forpolluters.   The way was clear for a newcomer after some of the party's bestknown figures declined to run for the leadership post. McLaughlinwas the only woman among seven hopefuls.   She has provided few specifics of what direction she will takeas party leader, speaking simply of a new vision and new approachto the political process. She has blamed Canada's free tradeagreement with the United States for most of Canada's currentproblems and said the party will oppose it again in the nextnational election, which is some three years away.   The trade pact, opposed by the Liberal Party as well as the NewDemocrats, took effect last Jan. 1 after the hard-fought electionreturned Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive ConservativeParty for a second consecutive majority government.   The Conservatives won 43 percent of the popular vote, theLiberals 32 percent and the New Democrats 20 percent, enough for arecord 43 of the 295 seats in the House of Commons.   But the popular vote level for the party, known as the NDP,didn't increase from past performances.   The New Democrats' strength has been in Western Canada, and theparty failed to make a much heralded national breakthrough intoFrench-speaking Quebec and remained of limited appeal in Canada'sAtlantic coastal provinces.   McLaughlin was born and grew up near Windsor, Ontario. Sheseparated from her husband in the early part of the 1970s and hertwo children were old enough to be on their own by 1979.   In what is becoming a much told story in Canada, she bought atruck that year and headed north to settle in the Yukon.   Her earlier career had been in social work, and she worked inWhitehorse, the Yukon's capital, as a consultant on social policydevelopment. She also worked as an NDP organizer and policy adviser.   She became nationally known after winning a 1987 race for theYukon's one seat in the House of Commons, a seat that had been heldby a Progressive Conservative for the previous 30 years.   Although some skepticism has been heard in Canada about whetherthe present moment in world history is a time for revitalizing asocial democratic party, Mulroney's declining popularity in opinionpolls indicates plenty of room for opposing viewpoints.   A Gallup poll released Nov. 23 found that 26 percent ofCanadians would vote for the Progressive Conservatives if anelection were held now, 25 percent for the New Democrats and 42percent for the Liberals.   Liberal leader John Turner, whose opposition to the free tradepact helped revitalize his party, is stepping down and a successorwill be chosen in June.   McLaughlin studied French as part of her preparations for theNDP leadership race and used her speaking appearances at theconvention to show an acceptable accent if limited fluency. Hercomments were considered an attempt to show that the party remainsseriously interested in Quebec.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Friday PMs, Dec. 15</NOTE></DOC>
