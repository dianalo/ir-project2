The idea, part of the Treasury's proposal to restructurethe banking system, is designed to slow the drain on thedeposit insurance fund and force banks to build capital andfollow prudent lending practices. But many small bankers andsome economists fear that the change would trigger massiveand disruptive withdrawals by depositors worried about thesafety of their funds.</LP><TEXT>   The legal ceiling on deposit insurance is currently$100,000 for each depositor. But when banks fail, mostdeposits are fully covered, no matter how large the accounts.The Treasury proposal would explicitly limit coverage to$100,000 for any combination of insured checking and savingsaccounts and another $100,000 for any combination ofretirement accounts.   Several congressional leaders also have proposed limits ondeposit insurance. But the task will be politically difficultwith voters already nervous about bank failures and theprojected insolvency of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'sbank insurance fund.   In addition, the politically powerful Independent BankersAssociation, which represents 6,200 community banks, stronglyopposes limits on deposit insurance. The group worries thatlarger depositors will move their money to big banks, whichhave been considered too large for the government to allowthem to fail. Under the proposed plan, the deposit insurancelimits would take effect only when federal officialsliquidate failed banks.   The Treasury also will propose ways to limit the so-called&quot;too big to fail&quot; doctrine. The lengthy blueprint theTreasury plans to unveil next week also will propose:   -- Giving well-capitalized banks permission to combinewith commercial industrial corporations, a change that wouldend a long-standing separation of banking and commerce.   -- Creating a class of financial services holdingcompanies to allow banks to operate under the same corporateumbrella as securities firms and perhaps insurance companiesas well.   -- Freeing banks to establish nationwide branch networks.   -- Simplifying bank regulation. One agency would becomethe sole regulator of most of the nation's banks, althoughthe Federal Reserve Board would continue to regulate the 40or 50 largest banks, those with extensive internationaloperations. In addition, well-capitalized banks would havemore operational flexibility than weaker banks.   The Treasury's deposit proposal is complex and wouldn'ttake effect until the FDIC had worked out the details. Underthe proposal, all bank accounts would be listed by thedepositor's Social Security number. When a bank failed, thesenumbers would be checked by computer to reveal all of theaccounts held by each depositor in the defunct bank.   If a depositor held total checking and savings deposits of$150,000-$90,000 in the failed bank and $60,000 in anotherbank, the FDIC would pro-rate the coverage over the twoaccounts. Since the $100,000 of insurance covers two-thirdsof the total deposits, the FDIC would immediately pay thedepositor $60,000, or two-thirds of the $90,000 in the failedbank. Over time, as the FDIC liquidated the bank, thedepositor would get back most of the remaining $30,000.   To avoid disruption, the plan would be phased in overabout six years. During that period, the Treasury assumesthat private deposit insurance would develop to cover theportion of deposits above $100,000. In addition, the Treasurywill propose the deposit premiums that banks pay to supportthe Bank Insurance Fund be related to the financial health ofthe bank, with well-capitalized banks -- those least likelyto fail -- paying lower premiums than weaker banks.   The Treasury plan is designed to attract capitalinvestment to the banking industry, impose stiffer marketdiscipline on how banks operate, limit the subsidy that banksget by being able to attract federally insured deposits whileprotecting basic deposit insurance for savers.   Separately, Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) yesterdayissued a report criticizing the FDIC for its costlyresolution of two large Texas bank failures. He charged thatthe terms the FDIC granted to NCNB Corp. when it took overFirst RepublicBank Corp. in 1988 and to Banc One Corp. whenit took over MCorp in 1989 were too generous. Mr. Schumerfaulted the FDIC for selecting BancOne's bid over a rivaloffer from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., which he said wouldhave required nearly $300 million less in cash outlays by theFDIC.   Among other things, Mr. Schumer said the FDIC must do moreto generate competitive bids and to get a share of theprofits when healthy banks successfully take over failedbanks with government assistance.   FDIC Chairman William Seidman said that the transactionshad already been thoroughly reviewed by banking committees inCongress and by the General Accounting Office. Although Mr.Seidman refused to comment on specifics of the latest report,he said &quot;they got all the numbers mixed up.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
