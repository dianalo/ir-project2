Fisk, is no way to run a railroad.    He points to the dirty, littered passenger car. He gripes about surly, &quot;overpaid&quot; train crews. He labels the line's owner &quot;wretched&quot; and its customer-service standards befitting a &quot;Soviet meat market.&quot;    Yes, sir. If Rodney Fisk ran this railroad, things sure would be different.    Just another crabby commuter? No, Mr. Fisk really wants to run this railroad -- so badly that he is hounding its owner with what he calls &quot;a hostile takeover offer&quot; for the line. Never mind that the 47-year-old part-time town councilman and full-time landlord has never worked on a railroad. Or that he's offering only $10. Total.    We're not talking Orient Express here. This is the Dinky.    America's shortest commuter line. Just 2.7 miles of track. One car. And it loses $1,000 a day, shuttling the wealthy, the scholarly and lesser mortals between this noted university and executive enclave and the plebeian mainline trains down at Princeton Junction. From there they join the masses trudging to and from New York, Philadelphia or beyond.    The Dinky -- once called the PJandamp;B, for Princeton Junction andamp; Back -- belongs to New Jersey taxpayers, through New Jersey Transit Corp. That's precisely the problem, say Mr. Fisk and his fans. If NJT would just let go, the line could become a profitable private enterprise earning him $50,000 annually instead of costing taxpayers six times that.    &quot;The Dinky really is a very simple operation,&quot; the bearded, bespectacled and tweedy Mr. Fisk maintains. It's &quot;a horizontal elevator.&quot; It loses money, he charges, because NJT's notion of productivity is &quot;permanently tied to the '50s -- 1850s, that is.&quot;    Mr. Fisk, a Harvard business school graduate, says he would do big things with the little railroad if he had it.    Like cut it down to size. First, the current sophisticated Arrow III electric car would go back to NJT; it's &quot;technological overkill,&quot; he declares. He has a point. The $1.1 million Arrow can go 100 miles an hour, so theoretically a trip to the Junction could be a thrilling under-two-minute experience. But the limit on the rickety track is 35 mph. An English-made diesel rail bus would do nicely, he says.    Then he would shrink the Dinky staff. He would replace each unionized two-man crew of conductor and engineer with one non-union worker at $8.50 an hour, half the current wage. A ticket machine would replace the Princeton station agent. Overall, two shifts a day, seven days a week, he would employ four people instead of nine. He would also scrap work rules he calls restrictive.    Mr. Fisk politely asked to buy the Dinky in 1984 only to be told it wasn't for sale. He wangled an official audience with NJT brass but still was rebuffed. Repeated proposals since have all been met by long official rejections challenging his ability to finance, operate, repair, staff, insure and even clean the Dinky.    Finally, he says, he became frustrated in the role of friendly suitor and &quot;moved into a Carl Icahn approach, challenging the board.&quot; In that spirit, his &quot;takeover offer&quot; is laden with Wall Street imagery. (Ironically, Mr. Fisk was once an executive of Trans World Airlines, one of Mr. Icahn's notable conquests.)    An official-looking prospectus addresses New Jersey taxpayers as &quot;shareholders&quot; of the Princeton Line, the Dinky's formal name. Naturally, it promises value for shareholders -- the equivalent of $5.9 million -- though only $10 from Mr. Fisk. He peppers state officials with surveys, proposals, letters and guest newspaper columns. He seeks riders' support and once even solicited their &quot;proxies&quot; with a semirealistic offering circular. (When only six commuters responded, he gave up.)    Mr. Fisk explains his offer this way: Taking the railroad off NJT hands would eliminate an estimated $34,000-a-month operating subsidy for labor, maintenance, fuel and other costs. That, he reasons, would be the equivalent of the state's putting $4.6 million in the bank and earning 8% interest over 30 years. Returning the Arrow III to the state for use elsewhere is worth an additional $2 million, he says. From that $6.6 million or so of &quot;value,&quot; he would like New Jersey Transit to buy him two diesel rail buses and related equipment -- a total of $750,000 -- leaving the projected net &quot;value&quot; of about $5.9 million.    But Mr. Fisk's arguments aren't just financial. In Princeton, intellectual issues matter -- even with the Dinky.    Take economics. The current operation is absolutely Marxist, providing &quot;comfortable, secure and well-paid jobs&quot; over customer service, declares Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton University economics professor and an unabashed Fisk-fan. &quot;I've said to my students a thousand times that if they ever want a taste of life behind the Iron Curtain, take the Dinky.&quot;    And politics. &quot;Any public subsidy diverts funds from higher-priority uses,&quot; avers Mr. Fisk, a self-described convert from liberalism to libertarianism. New Jersey's selling him the Dinky would be another proper step in privatizing government industry, he argues -- akin to the federal disposal of Conrail last year.    Of course, others see things differently. &quot;He wants to bring back slavery,&quot; fumes Arthur Radford, a Dinky engineer. Conductor Robert Farina bristles at the idea of crewmen sweeping the car between runs. NJT's executive director, Jerome Premo, is insulted: &quot;He paints himself as a little guy fighting stupid bureaucrats. I don't view myself as stupid or a bureaucrat.&quot;    State officials doubt that Mr. Fisk could make money, noting that they inherited the line in the first place because it was a loser. &quot;I just don't think it can be made profitable,&quot; says Alan Dustin, NJT rail-operations general manager. Yet if Mr. Fisk gets the line, &quot;fails, and turns the Dinky into a wreck, we'll have to get it running again,&quot; complains NJT director Martin Brody.    And as for striking a blow for private enterprise, Mr. Brody scoffs. Mr. Fisk simply wants to &quot;have the line turned over to him,&quot; Mr. Brody says, &quot;and have the financing come from public agencies. That's a nice arrangement, but I don't consider it privatization.&quot;    Dinky riders appear to be split. &quot;I believe in free enterprise and opportunity. I'm 100% for it,&quot; says Peter Hercz, a Mobil Corp. manager in New York. R. William Potter, a lawyer, is also cheering Mr. Fisk on. &quot;If Rodney can pull this off in Princeton,&quot; he says, &quot;then there would be great pressure to improve service throughout New Jersey Transit.&quot;    But Richard A. Goldberg, another lawyer, fears that Mr. Fisk would &quot;drive up the price, put people out of work and the service will be even less reliable.&quot; Roger Bodman, former state transportation commissioner, suspects that many &quot;Dinky lovers in Princeton {fear being} cut loose from the deep pockets of New Jersey Transit.&quot; NJT's Mr. Dustin claims that residents would reject Mr. Fisk's scaled-down railroad as a &quot;degradation of service,&quot; especially after a good whiff of its diesel fumes.    Actually, the Dinky has been getting dinkier for a long time. Initially 3.2 miles long, it lost a half-mile in three bites by 1920 and shrank 50 more feet recently.    That's not important, however. What matters is that Princeton keep its train. There are 123 years of tradition in this stretch of track. According to the authoritative Trains magazine, upscale commuters appeared even before the turn of the century; a noted Princeton lawyer and his friends routinely traveled to their New York City jobs by private locomotive and parlor car. And the line has always been vital to Princeton University. In 1898, 31 separate trains chugged up the rails to deliver 16,662 people to the Yale-Princeton football game; six years later, 42 trains carried 30,582 fans. (Football specials ended around 1960.)    Residents in the 1970s beat back a proposed substitute bus-way with a rousing &quot;Save the Dinky&quot; drive. &quot;Princeton without the Dinky isn't Princeton,&quot; maintains Mr. Reinhardt, the economics professor. University vice president Eugene McPartland sums it all up: &quot;We don't care who runs the Dinky as long as it runs.&quot;    So far, it's unclear whether Mr. Fisk or NJT will finally run the Dinky. A decision could be months off; NJT's board of directors now is awaiting certification of Mr. Fisk's plan by an independent accountant.    Over the past four years, NJT's staff has used $100,000 of time finding Mr. Fisk's proposals inadequate. It has defused some of his issues by changing operating rules, and is considering borrowing more of his ideas, including ticket machines and replacing the Arrow III with a lightweight car that would be cheaper to run.    But Mr. Fisk won't quit. He has support. New Jersey Republican Rep. James Courter calls Mr. Fisk's offer a &quot;serious proposal that deserves serious consideration.&quot;    Mr. Fisk has patience. The seriousminded bachelor says he has been looking for &quot;something uniquely challenging&quot; ever since he quit TWA in 1980 and his plans to build an amphibious biplane flopped. His takeover campaign isn't costing much, and income from his Princeton apartment building supports him nicely.    And he has the name. Students of railroad history may recall that in the mid-1800s, a New York financier named James Fisk teamed up with another investor, Jay Gould, to take over the Erie Railroad from rail baron Cornelius Vanderbilt.    Actually, Princeton's Mr. Fisk isn't related, and that's probably just as well. The 19th-century Mr. Fisk was a bit of a scoundrel. He was later tossed out of the Erie for stock manipulation and was in on a scheme to corner the gold market that led to the Black Friday scandal of 1869. Finally, that Mr. Fisk died at the hands of a former business associate and rival for the attentions of a New York actress. </TEXT></DOC>
