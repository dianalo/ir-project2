Biogen, which has consistently reported financial losses, said it expects to grant licenses to other pharmaceutical companies. &quot;We expect it to result in significant revenues for Biogen beginning in 1988,&quot; James Vincent, chairman and chief executive officer, said.    Analysts said the patent and Biogen's use of it may indicate the direction of patent protection in the emerging genetic engineering field.    &quot;In the biotechnology business, this will happen a lot more,&quot; said Cynthia RobbinsRoth, editor of BioVenture View, a San Mateo, Calif., newsletter. &quot;Very few patents have been issued yet, but there are a lot of products well down the line.&quot; She said genetically engineered products often come to market before the U.S. patent office decides among competing claims of invention.    Biogen said it was granted a patent covering the manufacture of all hepatitis B surface and core antigens by genetic engineering. Antigens stimulate the immune system to make antibodies to fight particular microbes. Biogen said that among the products covered by its patent would be a vaccine made by Merck andamp; Co., based in Rahway, N.J. SmithKline Beckman Inc., Philadelphia, makes one in Belgium for the European market, and Biogen said it expects to apply for broader application of a hepatitis B patent granted in Europe last March.    SmithKline and Merck declined to comment on Biogen's announcement.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Biogen shares closed at $4.875, up 25 cents.    Hepatitis is a viral infection of the liver caused by contact with contaminated blood. Some 300,000 people get it in the U.S. each year; there are more than 250 million carriers world-wide and two million associated deaths annually. Genetically engineered vaccines and diagnostic tests have come to market in the past two years, and are rapidly replacing naturally synthesized products. Biogen estimated that next year, hepatitis B vaccines and tests will be a $200 million market.    Mr. Vincent said Biogen isn't interested in manufacturing hepatitis B pharmaceuticals. He said that &quot;we would expect . . . significant royalties but short of 10%.&quot; He declined to be more specific.    Any revenue will be welcome at Biogen, which has received lots of publicity since its $58 million public offering in 1983, but little revenue. Last year, it had a net loss of $28.2 million on revenue of $10.1 million. For the first nine months of this year, it had a net loss of $19.2 million on revenue of $9.3 million.    Stuart Weisbrod, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said licenses &quot;could be significant revenues for Biogen. They're solidly in the red, so every bit of revenue helps.&quot; He predicted that Biogen will settle for &quot;modest&quot; royalties of 2%. &quot;If it's 6%, it will be worth Merck's while to fight vigorously, and Merck's fighting vigorously isn't good for Biogen.&quot;    However, Kathleen Behrens, an analyst with Robertson, Colman andamp; Stephens in San Francisco, said that the &quot;high single digits would be high, but not impossible.&quot;    Biogen said it is negotiating with a number of pharmaceutical companies over licensing its patent. However, the license would probably be most valuable to Merck, which has already developed the market, analysts said.    Biogen said its patent is based on work done by Kenneth Murray, a professor at University of Edinburgh, Scotland, who is a member of Biogen's scientific and supervisory boards. Biogen applied for the patent in 1979, based on the professor's work. The patent office determines patents based on the earliest work on the invention. It couldn't be learned whether other companies had applied for similar patents.    James F. Haley, a New York patent attorney who represents Biogen, said there are a number of genetically engineered products on the market or under development by several different companies that are likely to be subject to patent battles later. &quot;It's too early to tell how the industry will handle it,&quot; he said. But the Biogen plan to license hepatitis B antigens &quot;is saying they don't want to disrupt the industry,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
