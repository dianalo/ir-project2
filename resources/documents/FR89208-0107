Description of ChlordimeformChlordimeform is the common name for Nandmin172;-(4-Chloro-o-tolyl)-N, N-dimethylformamidine.Chlordimeform hydrochloride is the common name for Nandmin172;-(4-Chloro-o-tolyl)-N,N-dimethylformamidinehydrochloride. The two most common trade names are Galecron (Ciba-GeigyCorporation) and Fundal (Nor-Am Chemical Company). Both Ciba-Geigy andNor-Am are registrants of technical chlordimeform and chlordimeform hydrochloride.Chlordimeform, an insecticide, is used on cotton to control <T3>Heliothis spp.</T3>B. Legal BackgroundA pesticide product may be sold or distributed in the United States onlyif it is registered or exempt from registration under the Federal Insecticide,Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended (7 U.S.C. 136 <T3>et seq.</T3>). Before a product can be registered it must be shownthat it can be used without ``unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.''(FIFRA section 3(c)(5)). The term ``unreasonable adverse effects on theenvironment'' is defined in FIFRA section 2(bb) as ``any unreasonable riskto man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social, andenvironmental costs and benefit of the use of any pesticide.'' The burdenof proving that a pesticide meets this standard for registration is, atall times, on the proponent of initial or continued registration. If atany time the Agency determines that a pesticide no longer meets this standard,the Administrator may cancel this registration under section 6 of FIFRA.The Special Review process provides a mechanism to permit public participationin EPA's deliberations prior to issuance of any Notice of Final Determinationdescribing the regulatory action which the Administrator has selected.The Special Review process, which was previously called the RebuttablePresumption Against Registration (RPAR) process, is described in 40 CFRPart 154, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 27, 1985 (50 FR 49015). The Special Review process is commenced by the issuance of a preliminarynotification to registrants and applicants for registration pursuant to40 CFR 154.21 that the Agency is considering commencing a Special Review.If the Agency determines, after issuance of a notification pursuant to40 CFR 154.21, that it will not conduct a Special Review, it is requiredunder 40 CFR 154.23 to issue a proposed decision to be published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>. That regulation requires that a period of notless than 30 days be provided for public comment on the proposed decisionnot to conduct a Special Review. Subsequent to receipt and evaluation ofcomments on the proposed decision not to conduct a Special Review, theAdministrator is required by 40 CFR 154.25 to publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> his final decision regarding whether or not aSpecial Review will be conducted. C. Regulatory History Chlordimeform was first registered in 1968 for use on apples. Between 1968and 1976 use on several more crops was authorized, including cotton. In1976 the registrants voluntarily withdrew chlordimeform from the marketbased on results of a chronic mouse study showing that chlordimeform causedmalignant turmors. Chlordimeform was reintroduced to the market in 1978 with only the cottonuse on the label. At that time, extensive protective clothing measureswere required as well as requirements for mixing and loading in closedsystems, reduced application rates, restricted use classification, andtraining for workers. Registrants were also required to implement a workerurine monitoring program. Following the reintroduction of chlordimeform,the Agency received additional positive mouse cancer studies on chlordimeformand its metabolites. On September 15, 1985, the Agency issued a preliminary notification tothe registrants of chlordimeform, pursuant to 40 CFR 154.21, based on evidencethat chlordimeform caused tumors in laboratory animals. On January 15,1986, a draft Registration Standard for chlordimeform was issued for publiccomment. This document notified the public that the Agency would initiatea Special Review and invited comments from registrants and other interestedparties. Public comment on the draft Registration Standard was initiatedbecause there was a substantially complete chronic health and teratologydata base for chlordimeform (40 CFR 155.34). The Agency decided not toissue a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice merely announcing initiation of a SpecialReview but to proceed directly to a combined Notice of Initiation of SpecialReview and Preliminary Determination. A Notice of Preliminary Determinationsets forth both the risks and the benefits of the chemcial, analyzes therisks and benefits, discusses regulatory options for reducing risk, andproposes a regulatory action. The Agency was preparing a combined Noticeof Initiation of Special Review and Preliminary Determination when, priorto formal initiation of a Special Review, on February 19, 1988, Ciba-Geigyand Nor-Am, the only registrants of chlordimeform, requested voluntarycancellation of all products containing chlordimeform, effective February19, 1989. Both companies announced their intent to discontinue sale anddistribution after the 1988 cotton-growing season, about October 1, 1988;they indicated that they expected existing stocks, about the same amountas they sold in 1987, to be used up in the 1988 growing season. Both companiesalso stated that they would recall any unused stocks down to the user level,and would dispose of these recalled stocks. Both companies requested immediatewithdrawal of all tolerances except for cotton; they requested the withdrawalof the cotton related tolerances effective December 31, 1990. The Agencyhas approved amendments submitted by both companies which place a terminationdate of Febraury 19, 1989 on their chlordimeform registrations.  The Agency has also discussed with the National Institute of OccupationalSafety and Health (NIOSH) and various State health agencies, a possibleprogram to contact agricultural and factory workers exposed to significantlevels of chlordimeform in the past. The purpose of such notification wouldbe to inform workers of their increased risk of bladder cancer, and toencourage them to seek medical attention, such as cancer screening tests,which would allow early detection and treatment. No decision has been madeyet to pursue a notification program. This Notice announces that, for the reasons explained in the September19, 1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4> Notice (53 FR 36422) and summarized in Unit IVof this Notice, the Agency will not initiate the Special Review based onthe companies' voluntary cancellations. The Agency has cancelled Ciba-Geigy'sand Nor-Am's chlordimeform registrations, effective February 19, 1989.The September 19, 1988, proposed notice contained a prohibition againstthe sale, distribution, and use of existing stocks after February 19, 1989.This notice announces EPA's decision to prohibit sale and distributionafter February 19, 1989, but to allow the use of existing stocks in thepossession of end users, until October 1, 1989, based on comments and informationreceived from users, state officials, and researchers, which the Agencyused in a risk/benefit analysis of the short term use of chlordimeformuntil October 1, 1989. The reasons for granting this provision are alsodiscussed in Unit IV.  <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Risk Concerns </ITAG>A. Oncogenic Risks A private notification, issued pursuant to 40 CFR 154.21, which began thepre-Special Review process, was sent to chlordimeform registrants becauseof Agency concerns that chlordimeform exceeded the risk criterion for oncogenicitynow specified in 40 CFR 154.7(a)(2). This concern was specifically basedon four mouse oncogenicity studies which demonstrate significant dose-relatedincreases in tumor rates in male and female mice. These studies are discussedat length in the draft Chlordimeform Registration Standard, which can beobtained from the address given above for <T2>``FURTHER INFORMATION.'' </T2>After the private notification to registrants, the Agency received preliminaryfindings from a retrospective mortality study of German production workerswhich suggests 4-chlor-o-toluidine (5-CAT), a metabolite of chlordimeformwhich has been detected in the urine of exposed agricultural workers, mayinduce bladder cancer in humans. The metabolite 5-CAT belongs to a classof organic chemicals, the substituted anilines, many members of which havebeen identified as carcinogenic. Based on animal data, EPA had previously concluded that there is sufficientexperimental evidence to classify chlordimeform as a B<T2>2</T2> or probable human carcinogen, pursuant to Agency carcinogenassessment guidelines. The human data from the epidemiological study ofworkers support the classification of chlordimeform as a probable humancarcinogen. B. ExposureExposure estimates for chlordimeform were developed using data from CibaGeigy/Nor-am urine monitoring studies and the Agency's surrogate data base.The estimated values for absorbed dose varied by little more than an orderof magnitude. The variations in values are not viewed as significant andin fact represent a reasonable agreement between the dermal surrogate dataand urine data and support the level of confidence in the exposure determinations.A detailed exposure analysis is contained in the public docket and wassummarized in the September 19 notice.C. Applicator RiskThe Agency concluded that the most appropriate potency value for the parentcompound with regard to mixer/loader/applicator risk is 0.94 (mg/kg/day)^1.This value was chosen because it represents the geometric mean of cancerpotency for malignant hemangioendotheliomas observed in the mouse oncogenicitystudies.After considering the data related to exposure and oncogenicity, the Agencydeveloped risk estimates for agricultural workers. The following Table1 summarizes the risk estimates for workers, mixer/loaders, and scouts:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,7,7</C><T4>Table </T4>1_<T4>Lifetime Cancer Risks for Applicators Exposed to Chlordimeform</T4><H1> </H1><H1>EPA surrogate data</H1><H1>Urine data agency corrections</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Mixers/loaders <D>10</D>^3 <D>10</D>^3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pilots <D>10</D>^4 <D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Flaggers <D>10</D>^4 <D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Scouts <D>10</D>^6 <D/></ITAG></ITAG>The exposure value used in the risk calculation for mixer/loaders (0.023mg/kg/ working day) was the absorbed dose value calculated by the Agencybased on adjustments to the urine data base. Risk estimates for mixer/loadersbased on the Ciba-Geigy/Nor-Am urine data are 10^3, and are consistentwith those risk estimates based on the Agency's surrogate dermal data base.The risk estimates are for the upper 95 percent confidence level. For thepurposes of conducting risk assessments, the Agency traditionally assumesa life expectancy of 70 years. In addition, the Agency traditionally assumesagricultural workers have a 35-year working lifetime.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Comments on Proposed Notice Not To Initiate Special Review</ITAG>Virtually all comments received concerned the Agency's proposal to prohibitthe use of existing stocks of chlordimeform after the date of cancellation,February 19, 1989. The Agency's response to these comments appears in thefollowing Unit III.A. In making the proposal, the Agency assumed that allstocks of chlordimeform would be used up in 1988, and so there would beno stocks remaining in 1989; in addition, the registrants had agreed torecall any unused stocks down to the end user level. However, drought andlow pest pressure in 1988 combined to reduce the usage of chlordimeformto about 75 to 90 percent of usage in more typical years. Based on limitedsurveys and estimates by State agricultural officials and the registrants,the Agency believes that there are significant stocks of chlordimeform(thought to be within a range of 10 to 25 percent of a normal year's supply;that is, 100,000 to 250,000 pounds) remaining in the hands of end users.Therefore, in light of the larger than expected stocks of chlordimeformin the hands of end users and in light of the comments of State pesticideofficials and user groups, the Agency has conducted a risk/benefit analysisof allowing the use of existing stocks of chlordimeform in 1989. This risk/benefitanalysis appears in the following Unit III.B.A. Agency's Response to CommentsComments were received from the following organizations and state regulatoryagencies:<ITAG tagnum="15">Arizona Agricultural Chemical Association (1)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Arizona Commission of Agriculture and Horticulture (2)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Arizona Cotton Growers Association (3)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Arizona Farm Bureau Federation (4)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Agricultural Council of Arkansas (5)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Arkansas State Plant Board (6)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Association of America Pesticide Control Officials (7)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Georgia Agricultural Chemical Association (8)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Georgia Cooperative Extension Service (9)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Georgia Department of Agriculture (10)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Helena Chemical Corporation (11)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Louisiana Agricultural Aviation Association (12)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service (13)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation (14)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Mississippi Cooperative Extension Service (15)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce (16)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">National Agricultural Aviation Association (17)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">National Cotton Council (18)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">North Carolina Farm Bureau Federation (19)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Sundance Farms (20)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Trans-Pecos Cotton Association (21).</ITAG>In addition, numerous comments were received from individual cotton growersand pesticide applicators. These latter comments are substantially thesame as those comments made by state regulatory officials, and are answeredin the responses to the state regulatory officials.1. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter (3) states that the Agency does not havelegal authority to prohibit use of a voluntarily canceled pesticide, andthat the Agency's proposal to not allow use of existing stocks is not consistentwith an earlier proposal to allow use with restrictions.<T3>Agency's Response: </T3>In determining the status of stocks of pesticidesvoluntarily canceled pursuant to section 6(f), the Administrator may ormay not permit the sale and use of existing stocks. The Agency is not preventedfrom changing its position on use of existing stocks, where such can bejustified under FIFRA, especially when new conditions become relevant.2. <T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters (6, 7, 8, 9, 14, and 17) stated thatit would be difficult to locate any remaining stocks of chlordimeform,especially if these stocks are in the hands of end users.<T3>Agency's Response: </T3>The Agency does not agree that it will be particularlydifficult to locate existing stocks of chlordimeform. Both registrantshave already contacted their dealer/distributor networks about the recallof chlordimeform, and have agreed to publicize the recall in appropriatenewspapers and agricultural journals in order to reach end users. In addition,the Agency notes that chlordimeform is a restricted use pesticide, andthat therefore records of chlordimeform sales have been required to bekept.3. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15,17, 19, and 21) stated that there is no means by which to dispose of chlordimeform,or that use of existing stocks of chlordimeform would pose less risk thantransportation and disposal, or that allowing use of chlordimeform wouldallow it to remain in the hands of people trained in proper safety procedures.<T3>Agency's Response: </T3>The Agency agrees that disposal of existingstocks of chlordimeform is a serious matter; however, the Agency does notagree that there is no method available to dispose of chlordimeform. Itis possible to incinerate chlordimeform, and it is this method of disposalthat registrants have agreed to use, not burial in landfills. The Agencyalso does not believe that allowing personnel employed by the registrantsto ship and handle chlordimeform in order to dispose of it is intrinsicallyriskier than allowing it to be used up; through many years of registereduse, personnel trained in proper safety procedures have shipped and handledchlordimeform in quantities larger than those expected to be involved inthe recall. Appropriate protective clothing and other safety measures canbe employed to mitigate risks.4. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter (11) states that there are no funds setaside to indemnify users who have remaining stocks of chlordimeform.<T3>Agency's Response: </T3>Section 15 indemnification provisions are notinvolved in this situation. A voluntary cancellation occurred here. Therewas no imminent hazard suspension as is required as one of the prerequisitesfor section 15 to be triggered.5. <T3>Comment: </T3>Some commenters (4, 5, 10, 15, and 16) expressed concernthat stocks of chlordimeform remaining in the hands of end users are notlikely to be turned in for disposal; as a result, there will be illegaluse of chlordimeform, probably by ground application, which poses higherrisks than the aerial applications that would occur if existing stocksof chlordimeform were to be used up. Furthermore, they comment that aerialapplicators will have to turn away customers who want to have chlordimeformapplied aerially.<T3>Agency's Response: </T3>The Agency is aware of the possibility thatnot all remaining stocks of chlordimeform may be returned, and then, inthe absence of an existing stocks provision, these stocks may be divertedto riskier ground application. However, the Agency believes that the effortsof the registrants to publicize the recall would result in at least somestocks being returned by users. If use after the date of cancellation wereillegal, the Agency would expect states to vigorously enforce the prohibitionagainst use of existing stocks. The Agency agrees with the commenters thataerial applicators, because of their extensive licensing procedures, aremore likely to comply with the prohibition against continued use of chlordimeform,and that this would possibly lead to less business for affected aerialapplicators during 1989. If the aerial applicators were not to refuse suchbusiness and undertook illegal applications, in addition to possible penalties,such illegal activity would jeopardize such aerial applicator's licenseand certification.6. <T3>Comment:</T3> Several comments (2, 3, 4, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 20)concerned the benefits of chlordimeform, arguing that there are no alternativepesticides with which to replace chlordimeform, or that use of chlordimeformwill delay development of resistance to the pyrethroid insecticides.<T3>Agency's Response:</T3> The Agency agrees that chlordimeform does havebenefits, and that these benefits will be foregone if use of existing stocksis not permitted. However, the Agency notes that there are alternativepesticides registered for ovicidal control of <T3>Heliothis spp.</T3> (methomyl and thiodicarb). The Agency further notesthat no data have been provided to show that chlordimeform delays resistanceto the pyrethroid insecticides.7. <T3>Summary of Comments:</T3> Comments generally concerned the practicalityof retrieving and disposing of remaining stocks of chlordimeform, the risksof disposal and of misuse of these stocks, and the benefits of these stocks.The Agency does not find any of the comments to be compelling in allowingor disallowing the use of remaining stocks. However, in consideration ofthe concern for the use or nonuse of remaining stocks as expressed in thesecomments, EPA has conducted an analysis of the short-term risks and benefitsregarding the possible use of existing stocks of chlordimeform in 1989.B. Risk/Benefit Analysis of Allowing Use of Existing Stocks<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Risks of Use of Existing Stocks of Chlordimeform</ITAG>In order for the Agency to allow the use of existing stocks of productscancelled as a result of a risk/benefit finding, EPA must determine thatthe benefits of the use of any existing stocks outweigh the risks of suchuse for the period of use. Chlordimeform registrations were not cancelledas a result of an Agency risk/benefit finding, but instead were cancelledvoluntarily by the registrants. Nevertheless, the Agency believes a risk/benefitanalysis for existing stocks is appropriate in this case because the Agencyhad issued a Preliminary Notification to the registrants and was in theprocess of preparing a Notice of Initiation of Special Review and a PreliminaryDetermination at the time the voluntary cancellation was filed. The incrementalrisk of allowing an additional year of use of the existing stocks of chlordimeformis calculated by dividing the lifetime risk by 70, and by dividing thisresult by some factor representing the reduced amount of chlordimeformto be used. The lifetime risk already includes an adjustment for 35 yearsof exposure during an assumed lifespan of 70 years, because occupationalexposures are assumed to be 35 years. This calculation assumes that riskis directly proportional to the total amount of pesticide handled overtime.In a typical year, about 1 million to 2 million pounds of chlordimeformare reportedly used. Based on specific information received through thepublic comments, the Agency believes that from 10 to 25 percent of thisamount of chlordimeform remains available for use in 1989. These assumptionsare based on a limited survey of Alabama pesticide distributors, whichconfirm earlier estimates by State regulatory officials and the registrants.However, comments and other information available to the Agency indicatethat there may be much larger stocks of chlordimeform remaining in thehands of end users; the Agency cannot fully evaluate the accuracy of anyof these estimates, because insufficient information has been submittedon the design of the surveys used to reach these estimates. Therefore,the Agency has calculated risks and benefits not only for the 10 percentand 25 percent remaining stocks assumption, but also on the worst caseassumption, that is, that there is an entire typical year's supply of chlordimeformremaining in the hands of end users. The Agency has received little specificinformation on how leftover stocks are divided between end users and distributors/retailers,but the registrants have indicated that virtually all remaining stocksare in the hands of end users.Two different scenarios can be proposed concerning the number of workersexposed to chlordimeform. In the first scenario, it would be assumed that,at most, the same number of workers will be exposed to chlordimeform in1989 as were exposed in earlier years, but that they will individuallybe exposed to less chlordimeform in proportion to the decrease in the supplyof chlordimeform (the ``constant number/reduced poundage'' assumption).This is believed to be a reasonable assumption because chlordimeform, arestricted use pesticide, would be applied only by air in 1989 (as mostcurrent labeling requires and as most chlordimeform has been applied inthe past), and because chlordimeform is applied in many cotton-growingareas; in brief, there are very few people qualified and equipped to applychlordimeform, and they are widely scattered.The second scenario would assume that a smaller number of individual workers,smaller in proportion to the decrease in the supply of chlordimeform, willapply the same amount of chlordimeform as in previous years (the ``reducednumber/constant poundage'' assumption). This may also be a reasonable assumption,since the decline in chlordimeform stocks may be regionally distributed,such that some regions may have no chlordimeform and others may have nearlyas much as in any other year. The reduced number/constant poundage assumptionresults in higher individual risk to a smaller number of applicators, whencompared to the results of the reduced poundage/constant number assumption.However, aggregate risk, the total number of cases of cancer arising froman additional year's use of chlordimeform, calculated by mutliplying individualrisk by the total number of exposed workers, is the same regardless ofwhich assumption about the number of applicators is used. There are nodata to support one assumption over the other, so risk numbers have beencalculated for both assumptions.Using the constant number/reduced poundage assumption, and assuming only10 percent (the low end of available estimates) of the 1988 chlordimeformsupply remains in the hands of end users, the individual oncogenic riskfrom an additional year's exposure to chlordimeform would be:Risk (as cited in the exposure analysis) X 1/10 X 1/70. Risk estimatesfor the other assumptions were adjusted accordingly. The following Table2 shows the individual risks to various groups of exposed workers, usingthe 10 percent, 25 percent and 100 percent available stock assumptions:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 2._Risk From an Additional Year of Chlordimeform Use</T4>1<H1>Exposed group</H1><H1>35-Year</H1>2 exposure risk<H1>No. at</H1>3 risk<H1>1-Year exposure</H1><H2>10% stocks</H2><H2>25% stocks</H2><H2>100% stocks</H2>A: Constant Number of Applicators/Reduced Poundage per Applicator:<ITAG tagnum="3">Mixer/Loaders</ITAG><D>4andmultiply;10</D>^3<D>124</D><D>10</D>^5-10^6<D>10</D>^5<D>10</D>^4-10^5<ITAG tagnum="3">Applicators</ITAG><D>1andmultiply;10</D>^4<D>204</D><D>10</D>^7<D>10</D>^6-10^7<D>10</D>^6B: Reduced Number of Applicators/Constant Poundage per Applicator:<ITAG tagnum="3">Mixer/Loaders</ITAG><D>4andmultiply;10</D>^3<D>12.4 or 31</D><D>10</D>^5-10^6<D>10</D>^5-10^6<D>10</D>^4-10^5<ITAG tagnum="3">Applicators</ITAG><D>1andmultiply;10</D>^4<D>20.4 or 51</D><D>10</D>^6<D>10</D>^6<D>10</D>^6<F>\1\ Additional risk has been rounded to the nearest order of magnitude.</F><F>\2\ Individual risk cited in exposure analysis and used in rounded formin Notice of Intent Not to Initiate Special Review.</F><F>\3\ From exposure analysis.</F></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">2. Benefits of Use of Existing Stocks of Chlordimeform</ITAG>The possible benefits from chlordimeform accrue indirectly from its contributionto reducing insect resistance to the pyrethroid insecticides, and directlyfrom its effects on cotton yields, through its control of <T3>Heliothis</T3> spp. The available data do not allow a definitive estimateof the magnitude of yield losses that could result from not using chlordimeformin 1989. Limited data indicate possible yield reductions of 5 to 10 percent,or an average of 7.5 percent on treated acres, about the same as the lossestimate developed by USDA in its preliminary benefits assessment, if otherpesticides are used in place of chlordimeform.Using a range of 0 to 7 percent loss on 28 percent of the harvested cottonacreage (that is, 100 percent of the annual usage before cancellation),the loss in benefits ranges from $10 to $220 million. Using a range of0 to 7 percent yield loss on 7 percent of the harvested cotton acreage(that is, 25 percent of the annual usage before cancellation), the lossin benefits ranges from $3 million to $54 million. Using a range of 0 to7 percent yield loss on 2.8 percent of the harvested cotton acreage (thatis, 10 percent of the prior annual usage), the loss in benefits rangesfrom $1 million to $22 million. The low end of the range reflects the greatercost of alternative pesticides, most likely to be methomyl or thiodicarbin this case. The upper end of the range reflects the possible greaterefficacy of chlordimeform over alternatives. These benefit estimates arebased on the small amount of data on yield losses, and may over or underestimateactual benefits.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Risk/Benefit Analysis of Use of Existing Stocks of Chlordimeform</ITAG>Making the worst case assumption that 100 percent of a normal year's supplyof chlordimeform remains in the hands of users, that is, 1 million pounds,the incremental risk from one additional year's use of chlordimeform tomixer/loaders is in the 10^4 to 10^5 range, and to applicators is 10^6.As shown in Table 2, individual risks from one more year of use under anyof the probable use scenarios are low. The incidence of cancer in the exposedgroup, as predicted by this assessment, would be negligible, because ofthe small number of applicators and mixer/loaders who handle chlordimeform.Benefits under the various scenarios range from $1 to $220 million. Giventhe minimal risk and the possible substantial benefits, the Agency concludesthat the use of existing stocks of chlordimeform in the 1989 growing seasondoes not pose unreasonable risks. However, because cancer risk from 35years of occupational exposure is high, estimated to be 1 in a 1000, andbecause epidemiological data suggest a correlation between exposure tothe 5-CAT metabolite of chlordimeform and excess incidence of bladder cancer,the Agency believes long term risks would be unacceptable.The Agency is requiring the registrants, Ciba-Geigy and Nor-Am, to conducttheir recall programs down to the dealer/distributor level, in order tobe sure that no further quantities of chlordimeform become available toend users.As mentioned previously, the EPA has held discussions with other Federaland State agencies regarding the possibility of notifying factory and agriculturalworkers who were exposed to significant levels of chlordimeform over longperiods of time of their elevated risk of bladder cancer. EPA believesthat factory workers' level of exposure to chlordimeform was substantiallyhigher than that to mixer/loaders or applicators, possibly resulting inas much as two orders of magnitude greater risk. Thus, EPA believes itis reasonable to allow limited exposure of mixer/loaders and applicatorsfor an additional year. Nevertheless, EPA supports the voluntary urinemonitoring program offered by the registrants to mixer/loaders and applicators.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Agency's Final Decision Regarding Special Review </ITAG>All chlordimeform registrations have been amended so that they terminateFebruary 19, 1989. The Agency received no comments objecting to its proposeddecision not to initiate a Special Review of chlordimeform. Therefore,the Agency will not initiate a Special Review of the use of chlordimeformon cotton. The only issue resulting from the Agency's proposal was theobjection to the prohibition of the use of existing stocks in 1989. The agency has conducted a short term risk/benefit analysis of the useof existing stocks of chlordimeform in the hands of end users and concludedthat the benefits of one additional year of limited use outweigh the risksof such use. Therefore, the use of chlordimeform stocks in the possessionof end users will be permitted until October 1, 1989. Such use must bein accordance with all label restrictions. Any further sale or distributionof existing stocks or recalled stocks by registrants, distributors, orretailers is prohibited after February 19, 1989. All use of chlordimeformafter October 1, 1989, is prohibited. Both registrants indicated they havenot marketed chlordimeform after the 1988 cotton season, around the beginningof October 1988. Both registrants also indicated that they will recallall existing stocks of chlordimeform down to the dealer/distributor level,and will accept for disposal any stocks of chlordimeform turned in by endusers. While the Agency has serious concerns about the long-term risks associatedwith chlordimeform use on cotton, it will not initiate a Special Reviewof chlordimeform because all use, and therefore exposure, will end at theend of the 1989 cotton-growing season. The cancellations will become effectiveautomatically on February 19, 1989. The Agency has acted in reliance onthe voluntary cancellation by proposing revocation of non-cotton tolerancesand by not initiating a Special Review. The Agency has other tools that may be available to it under FIFRA to takeregulatory action regarding chlordimeform, including initiation of SpecialReview and subsequent initiation of cancellation proceedings, immediateinitiation of cancellation proceedings, suspension, and emergency suspension.As compared with initiation of Special Review followed by initiation ofcancellation proceedings, or immediate initiation of cancellation proceedings,the action announced here reduces risks faster than would occur under thoseother more time-consuming approaches. Finally, the Agency does not believethat the appropriate tests for either suspension or emergency suspensionhave been met. <ITAG tagnum="84">V.
