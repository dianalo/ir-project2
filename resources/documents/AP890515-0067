About 140,000 supporters of the hunger strikers crowded into thesquare. Officials met with more than 50 students but protestleaders said the delegation did not represent the demonstrators.   Yan Mingfu, a member of the ruling Communist Party CentralCommittee Secretariat, told students at the meeting that themonth-long movement was patriotic. But said ``there has been anegative impact on the dignity of the country,'' according to theofficial Xinhua News Agency.   The students who met with officials were from state-sanctionedunions, which have been rejected by the pro-democracy studentmovement.   Students at Tiananmen said the officials made no promises beforethe talks broke off after three hours.   ``We have no choice but to continue the hunger strike until thegovernment gives in,'' said a student leader from the NorthernCommunications College.   The students reported over a loudspeaker in Tiananmen that70,000 of 220,000 workers at the Capital Steel Plant went on striketoday in support of the pro-democracy movement.   ``They carried signs ... saying they would do their best tosupport the students,'' said a Beijing Medical Union student.   The students had hoped to pressure the government intoconcessions by threatening to disrupt a welcoming ceremony forGorbachev, who arrived today for the first Chinese-Soviet summit in30 years.   But when it became clear the square could be cleared only withforce, the ceremony was held at the airport instead of at the GreatHall of the People beside the plaza.   Most of the students, who admire Gorbachev's domestic reformcampaign, moved to the opposite side of the vast square early todayin deference. But they refused to leave altogether and new groupsof students and several dozen teachers joined them throughout theday.   ``Maybe I will set myself on fire,'' one sobbing femalehunger-striker screamed into a loudspeaker that the strikers ranoff car batteries.   The decision to move Gorbachev's welcome clearly embarrassed thegovernment but also indicated its determination not to give in tostudent demands.   About 80 of the 1,800 students who began to fast on Saturdayafternoon in the shadeless square had been taken to hospitalssuffering from dehydration, sunstroke and exposure, said doctorswho stood by with ambulances.   Medical students handed out glucose, salt tablets and packets oftraditional Chinese medicine to strikers who felt faint.   Water and salt supplies were running short, the medics said, andthey issued urgent appeals for money.   The strikers' spirits were raised in the afternoon by theappearance of several thousand intellectuals, led by BeijingUniversity teachers and including writers and scholars.   ``Long live the teachers,'' students yelled. ``You give usinfinite strength.''   One 44-year-old chemistry teacher said, ``We think the studentshave raised reasonable requests and we think the government shouldhave a dialogue with them as equals.''   He said 90 percent of the university's teachers back the studentmovement, the biggest ever to confront the Communist government.   The hunger strikers were surrounded by nearly 30,000 supportingstudents from more than two dozen Beijing schools. Thousands oflocal residents flooded the square and some gave speeches ofsupport.   Students have been marching and holding sit-ins, marches andclass boycotts since April 15 to demand democracy in theirauthoritarian nation.   Hundreds of police moved into public buildings around the squarethroughout the day, but did not re-emerge to confront the crowd.   Hunger-Strike leaders said they had not been in contact withauthorities since talks broke down Sunday night.   The government has rejected student demands to recognize theorganizations and broadcast the discussions.   The students want a dialogue on the government's failure toenforce constitutional guarantees of free speech and press, oneconomic and political reforms and on a re-evaluation of thestudent movement.   Officials of the Beijing Institute of Science and Technologyarrived with wicker baskets of steamed bread for those students nothunger striking.   Most of the strikers lay on the ground or sat propped againsteach other, smoking, reading and sleeping.   ``My stomach doesn't hurt anymore _ it's numb,'' said a studentfrom the Central Nationalities Institute's English department.</TEXT></DOC>
