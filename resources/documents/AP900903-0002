White House aides said Bush's trip may be extended an additionalday to give the president a chance to meet on Saturday with FinishPresident Mauno Koivisto. In that case, Bush will leave for Finlandon Friday, said deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk.   The president will meet with Gorbachev for about five hours onSunday, including luncheon talks, and then return to Washington.   The crisis in the Middle East tops the agenda, although thepresident and White House aides have stressed that several othersubjects _ including progress toward an agreement on reducingtroops and tanks in Europe _ will also be discussed in some detail.   Side meetings between aides to Bush and Gorbachev are notplanned for this summit, said an official who spoke on condition ofanonymity. Such sessions usually are standard during summitmeetings.   Another official described the one-day session as more an``informal meeting'' between the two leaders.   Bush has said he does not expect the Soviet Union to mediatebetween Iraq and the United States. But the administration wouldwelcome any pressure Gorbachev can bring against Iraq, a longtimerecipient of Soviet arms.   Popadiuk said there was ``no doubt'' Bush would spend much timein the days ahead preparing for his third summit with Gorbachev,but that there were few details of the president's schedule at thistime.   ``I'm assuming he'll take into acount the view of alliedleaders,'' Popadiuk said.   In advance of other summits with Gorbachev, the president spenthours on the phone conferring with other western leaders.   Members of Congress begin to return to Washington and this week,and two foreign affairs committees will begin their officialscrutiny of the month-old Persian Gulf crisis.   Twenty-two House members returned Monday night from a tour ofBahrain, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, with lawmakers from both partiessupporting the administration.   ``All of us left here with the conclusion that the president'saction was a correct action,'' said House Majority Leader RichardGephardt, D-Mo. ``All of us come back believing that is the case.''   But the House members were concerned about the cost of theoperation, and Gephardt said his colleagues believed the financialburden should be shared by other nations.   Budget talks, stalemated when Congress left in early August forits recess, resume late this week. Administration officials say the$1-billion-a-month U.S. military operation in the Persian Gulf willmake reaching a deficit-cutting agreement even more difficult.   Bush spent his final day at his Maine family retreat boating andplaying golf, taking along national security adviser BrentScowcroft on both outings.   He was to meet with his Cabinet on Tuesday to brief it ondevelopments in the Persian Gulf.   On Thursday, the president was to travel to Topeka, Kan., andTallahassee, Fla., to help raise funds for Republican candidates.   The trip was expected to give Bush a chance to use a newlydelivered Air Force One for the first time. The new plane, aconverted Boeing 747, is much larger than the current planes usedfor Air Force One _ a pair of Boeing 707s that are more than 20years old.   Bush was then to take the new plane to Helsinki and back.   With only a week's advance notice on the summit, White Houseaides had little time to work out logistics.   ``Everybody's scrambling to put their pieces together,'' oneofficial said.   Sig Rogich, who oversees White House advance logistics andimagemaking, ended his vacation early on Sunday to coordinate theplanning.   Meanwhile, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said that any diplomaticsolution to the Persian Gulf crisis must regain Kuwaitisovereignty, assure Saudi Arabian security and ``assure theintegrity of Iraq.''   Jackson returned from Iraq on Sunday with 47 freed Americanhostages after he met for six hours with Iraqi leader SaddamHussein.   The civil rights leader and former Democratic presidentialaspirant urged Bush to pursue a diplomatic solution to reverseIraq's takeover of Kuwait and cautioned against relying solely onmilitary pressure.   ``Just as our generals are in Saudi Arabia with a militarypresence, our politicians should be as evident in seekingdiplomatic solutions,'' he said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' on Monday.   Jackson, who met with Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan as well asthe Iraqi president, said a diplomatic solution must ``regain thesovereignty of Kuwait, assure the security of Saudi Arabia andassure the integrity of Iraq.'' He called for an end to the``drum-beating hostile rhetoric.''   Jackson, in an interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,''said he challenged Saddam on his takeover of Kuwait, saying theannexation and his threats against Saudi Arabia were errors.   Asked to respond to criticism that he was exploiting thehostages' plight for his own political gains, he said, ``Suffice itto say, blessed are the peacemakers, even when they are beguiled.''</TEXT></DOC>
