The two offices were closed Friday by state regulators, and the FDIC arranged the transfer of Beaver Creek State's insured deposits to Citizens State because no bids were received for the purchase of the failed bank.    Beaver Creek State had assets of $7.3 million and held deposits of $7.3 million in 1,900 accounts, including about $32,000 in four accounts that exceed the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor. Those depositors will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds from the sale of the failed bank's assets.    Beaver Creek State was the 43rd bank to fail this year nationwide, the second in Minnesota. </TEXT></DOC>
