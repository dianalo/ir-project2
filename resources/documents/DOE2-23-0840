In this report we examined whether radiation inactivationof various enzymes and brain receptors is influenced by the preparationof samples preceding irradiation. The apparent target sizes of endogenousacetylcholinesterase and pyruvate kinase from rat brain and from rabbitmuscle and benzodiazepine receptor from rat brain were investigated insome detail. In addition the target sizes of alcohol dehydrogenase (fromyeast and horse liver), beta-galactosidase (from Escherichia coli), lactatedehydrogenase (endogenous from rat brain), and 5-HT2 receptors, acetylcholinemuscarine receptors, and [{sup 35}S] butyl bicyclophosphorothionate tertiarybinding sites from rat brain were determined. The results show that apparenttarget sizes are highly influenced by the procedure applied for samplepreparation before irradiation. The data indicate that irradiation offrozen whole tissue as opposed to lyophilized tissue or frozen tissuehomogenates will estimate the smallest and most relevant functional targetsize of a receptor or an enzyme.</TEXT></DOC>
