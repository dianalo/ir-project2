(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Gov. Bob Kerrey easily won theDemocratic nomination for Senate on Tuesday, while on theRepublican side, Sen. David Karnes was in a neck-and-neck race withRep. Hal Daub after a bitter, divisive campaign.   Karnes, the nation's youngest senator at 39, was appointed tothe job 14 months ago and running in his first election. Daub, 47,has represented the Omaha area in Congress for eight years.   With 40 percent of the vote counted, Karnes had 23,926 votes or50.7 percent and Daub had 23,248 votes or 49.3 percent.   The popular Kerrey had only token opposition from disbarredlawyer Ken Michaelis and was burying him 39,829 votes or 91.3percent to 3,807 votes or 8.7 percent.   In the presidential primaries, Vice President George Bush, whoalready has locked up the GOP nomination, faced no activeopposition for 25 GOP delegates; Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakisled Jesse Jackson in the race for 25 Democratic delegates.   Voters in Daub's 2nd District also decided wide-open races inboth parties. The leader among four Democrats was Cece Zorinsky,widow of Sen. Edward Zorinsky. Four Republicans were seeking theirparty's nomination.   And Nebraska voters decided whether to give lawmakers in thenation's only one-chamber Legislature their first pay raise in 20years, from $4,800 to $12,000 a year.</TEXT><TEXT>   Karnes, who had never before held public office, was appointedby Republican Gov. Kay Orr to fill the vacancy created byZorinsky's death in March 1987.   Daub, who had wanted the Senate appointment himself, mounted anaggressive campaign against Karnes, prompting some GOP leaders todub him a ``pit bull.''   Last week, Daub charged that Karnes was a ``rubber stamp'' forMrs. Orr and President Reagan. Karnes said he refused to be drawninto negative campaigning, and Mrs. Orr said it was ``sad'' thatDaub was resorting to ``desperate'' tactics.   An Omaha World-Herald poll taken the week before the primaryshowed 41 percent of those polled preferred Karnes, while 40percent backed Daub and the remainder were undecided. A LincolnJournal poll found Daub leading Karnes by a margin of 42 percent to41 percent, with 17 percent undecided.   The margin of error in the World-Herald poll was 4 percentagepoints, and 6.4 percentage points in the Journal polls.   Kerrey, 44, was elected governor in 1982 in his first bid forelective office. He chose not to run in 1986.   The last senator defeated in a primary was Richard Stone, aFlorida Democrat who lost in an Oct. 7, 1980, runoff to DemocratBill Gunter. Gunter was defeated that November by Republican PaulaHawkins.</TEXT></DOC>
