With the help of computed tomography andof special supplementary adjustments an important optimisation couldbe achieved. The following four questions could be solved: 1. Is it possibleon the basis of the CT-image to directly carry out the dose distribution(overlay)? 2. Can the best patient position be found more quickly andmore exactly? 3. Can the patient orientation be reliably reproduced?4. Can the quality of the carried-out irradiation be proven, that is,does one know with high reliability how exact the target volume is beingenclosed by the wished high doses and to what extent the neighboringrisk organs are being spared? For the solution of these questions practicaland feasible methods were developed.</TEXT></DOC>
