The Court of Appeal on Tuesday refused a request by British Railto block the planned walkout by 75,000 workers.   London's 10,500 subway workers decided Tuesday to go ahead withtheir seventh unofficial 24-hour strike this year over pay andconditions.   Delegates representing 18,500 bus workers in the Transport andGeneral Workers Union then decided on a lightning 24-hour strike todemand a 14 percent pay raise.   They rejected an offer of between 8 percent and 9 percent, whichLondon Buses said was ``roughly in line with inflation,'' nowrunning at 8.3 percent. The company said a bus driver operatingwithout a conductor earns $340 a week.   The train stoppage will be the first national rail strike since1982, when London subway workers also refused to work.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher condemned the strikers.   ``It's a typically selfish policy to put themselves first beforethose who have to use it, deliberately causing massive inconvenienceto those who have to work,'' she told the House of Commons.   British Rail, which says the strike will cost it $15.5 million,had asked the appeal judges to overrule a High Court refusal togrant an injunction requiring the National Union of Railwaymen tocancel the strike.   The railway said the strike should not be permitted because 200union members were not able to participate in the strike vote.   Union members voted 29,675 to 20,704 to strike over BritishRail's proposed 7 percent wage increase and plans to abolishnational wage bargaining.   The Court of Appeals found no evidence that anyone entitled tovote was prevented from doing so.   British Rail offered to return to the negotiating table and urgedstaff to ignore the strike call.   ``We are looking at a pretty well total shutdown,'' said PaulWatkinson, the state railroad's employee relations director.   The dispute between London Underground and 10,500 workers on thecapital's sprawling subway network involves introducing trainsoperated only by drivers. Drivers want a $99 weekly increase tooperate without a guard.   Management is offering $46 plus 14 days extra annual vacation,but is tying the raise to increased productivity.</TEXT></DOC>
