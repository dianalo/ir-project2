EZCorp Inc. will be hitting the road later this summer ina campaign to persuade investors to do just that.</LP><TEXT>   Never mind that the Austin, Texas, chain has only 43pawnshops today. Just think of what it could do after sellingthe public 1.8 million nonvoting Class A shares at $8 to $9apiece. Insiders would hold 5.1 million Class B shares andall voting rights of the company, whose $59 million marketvalue works out to about $1.4 million a pawnshop.   With an eye on becoming a sort of Wal-Mart among thenation's 6,900 pawnshops, EZCorp plans to open or acquire atleast 50 more stores by September of next year. By the end ofthe decade, it envisions itself as a national chain, rivalingCash America Investments Inc., the nation's largestpawnbroking chain with 157 shops in seven states. Traded onthe New York Stock Exchange, Cash America's stores are valuedby investors at a little more than $1 million each.   But can EZCorp convince Wall Street that what the worldneeds now is another publicly traded pawnbroker? Can itovercome the industry's inelegant image with the argumentthat pawnbroking chains are a fast-growing niche in consumerfinance?   &quot;There's still and always will be people who say it's adirty business, a bunch of thieves,&quot; says Dennis Telzrow, aretailing analyst at Principal/Eppler, Guerin andamp; Turner Inc.in Dallas.   &quot;I have a negative, visceral reaction to an industry thatcharges more than 200% a year in interest rates,&quot; adds PeterSchliemann, manager of the Babson Enterprise Fund in Boston.   Mr. Telzrow, however, is among a growing group of analystsand investors who sees opportunity where others may not deignto invest. &quot;Wall Street ignores companies exposed to the poorworking man,&quot; he says, noting that Cash America's customersinclude the fastest-growing cultures in the Sun Belt.   Some in the investment community have taken notice. CashAmerica's bluechip shareholders include Mellon Bank Corp.,Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and Wells Fargo Bank; Goldman,Sachs andamp; Co. follows the stock and provides research on thecompany.   EZCorp is working hard to dispel any notion that itsbusiness is unsavory. &quot;Pawnshops function as convenientsources of consumer credit and as value-oriented specialtyretailers of previously owned merchandise,&quot; explains thecompany's preliminary offering document.   Of course, the document concedes that pawnbroking isn'tquite as staid as your humdrum local bank. &quot;In connectionwith the operation of two of the company's pawnshops,allegations have been made to the Texas Consumer CreditCommissioner that employees of the company knowingly acceptedproperty alleged to have been stolen,&quot; the document says.EZCorp has since revised its training program &quot;to informemployees of the consequences of knowingly accepting stolengoods.&quot;   EZCorp says stolen goods represent less than 0.3% of itspawn loans. Like all Texas pawnbrokers, it must give thelocal police copies of its pawn tickets, including adescription of the goods and the owner's name and address,obtained from a valid identification card.   Many pawnbroking customers lack bank accounts, says JohnCaskey, an assistant economics professor at SwarthmoreCollege who studied the industry two years ago for theFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo. Customers leavetelevision sets, jewelry, guns or guitars in exchange for aloan -- generally said to be about half the resale value ofthe merchandise -- that must be repaid in a matter of months.   Interest rates, limited by state regulators, vary from 36%a year to 300%: Texas allows a maximum 240% a year. If theloan is repaid on time, as about 70% are, the client gets themerchandise back. Forfeited merchandise goes into inventoryto be sold. With loans averaging only $50 each, pawn loantransactions in 1988 accounted for just 0.1% of the nation'sconsumer loans, Mr. Caskey says. EZCorp's maximum loan isjust $360.   Pawnshops make their profits both from the high interestrates they charge and the merchandise they sell. In the 12months through March 31, EZCorp's gross profit margin onsales of merchandise was 25.6%.   EZCorp's underwriting will be led by Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.After the offering, 80% voting control will be retained by MSPawn Limited Partnership, a venture capital concern whosegeneral partner is Phillip Ean Cohen, an investment bankerwho works for New York-based Morgan Schiff andamp; Co.   In recent years EZCorp has acquired a dozen stores at anaverage cost of only $175,000 each. Beefing up the company'scomputer-controlled management system has added to expenses,though. Net income was $734,000 in the 12 months throughMarch 31; during that period the company had merchandisesales of $10.4 million and pawn-service charges of $8.4million.   EZCorp's president and chief executive officer, CourtlandL. &quot;Corky&quot; Logue Jr., earns a salary of $300,000 a year andwill have a 19.2% voting stake in the company. In addition,Mr. Logue, who also serves as the mayor of Rollingwood, asuburb of Austin, is entitled to a total of $144,212 through1994 for leasing the company three automobiles and two Cessnaairplanes. Since Jan. 1, 1988 his father has been paid$47,015 in commissions for finding new pawnshops to acquire,an arrangement under which the father gets 3% of the purchaseprice excluding real estate.   Mr. Logue has a reputation for running a well-managedoperation, says Mr. Telzrow, who believes chains will come todominate the business. Mr. Caskey of Swarthmore agrees thatdeep-pocketed chains will have a big advantage, but he warnsthat there is able competition from Mom 'n Pop stores.   And even bigger competitors could emerge, Mr. Caskey says:&quot;You may never see Citicorp Pawnbroking, but it seems like anatural area for the big institutions to get into.&quot;   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Over-the-counter stocks again led larger stocks higher,buoyed by late-afternoon computer-driven buying.
