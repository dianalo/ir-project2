The industrial application chosen was the freezedesalination of seawater powered by mid-temperature (385{degree}C) solarcollectors. This innovative process will compete with other downscaleddesalination processes for small communities in developing countries.Using solar energy to power this installation demonstrates the abilityof solar energy to fuel any industrial application that requires mid-temperatureenergy. 13 refs., 11 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
