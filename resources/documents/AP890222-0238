The statement urged the United States to be more prudent inapplying the 1988 Trade Act.   Trade Representative Carla Hills announced Tuesday the U.S.government has designated South Korea and the European EconomicCommunity for possible trade sanctions if they fail to lowerbarriers against U.S. telecommunications equipment.   Hills reportedly took the action following a five-monthinvestigation under the law, which requires the United States toopen negotiations with countries considered to be blocking sales byAmerican exporters.   If negotiations don't succeed in removing trade barriers within ayear, the law requires U.S. officials to impose trade sanctions.</TEXT></DOC>
