(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A storm that triggered floods across centralFlorida, causing at least six deaths and the evacuation of 1,000people, threatened homes and lives as it headed north today,officials said.   ``Tampa should be breaking out of the rain ... but north ofTampa they could still get some pretty substantial rain,'' NationalWeather Service meteorologist Randy Lascody said in Miami.   The storm has swamped the Gulf Coast with up to 15 inches ofrain since Sunday, causing more than $1 million in damage inhard-hit Manatee County, where a state of emergency was in effect.   The weather service issued a flash-flood watch for Gulf andFranklin counties in the Florida Panhandle.   A wave of showers moving north from the Gulf of Mexico wasexpected to settle over northern Florida and southern Georgia bytonight, Lascody said, adding that ``the real heavy stuff'' shouldbe heading up the southern Atlantic Coast.   Gov. Bob Martinez was to tour the stricken Bradenton area ofManatee County by Florida Air National Guard helicopter today todecide whether the area should be declared eligible for statedisaster relief money.   The rising waters left two dead on the west coast. A 44-year-oldTampa man was presumed drowned after his car plunged into a ditchand he was sucked into a pipe near downtown Tampa. In New PortRichey, a 2-year-old boy drowned in a rain-swollen canal.   The storm also contributed to a small plane crash Wednesday thatkilled all four aboard near Williston about 110 miles north ofTampa, National Transportation Safety Board investigator Ron Birdsaid Thursday.   The rainfall far surpassed the 5 inches dumped by HurricaneElena on Labor Day 1985, when wind and high tides did $9 milliondamage and sent 13,000 people to shelters.   In St. Petersburg, hundreds of mostly elderly residentsmistakenly thought the latest flooding was a hurricane.   ``This is insane,'' Pinellas County Emergency Managementdirector David Bilodeau said. ``There's just been gross panic forno reason at all.''   A tornado struck St. Petersburg Thursday night, causing morethan $20,000 damage to six houses but no injuries, fire officialssaid.   Manatee County commissioners allowed half of the 1,000 evacueesto return home Thursday as floodwaters began to recede.   Residents returning home were urged by county public healthofficers to disinfect sinks and showers, pitch out any food touchedby flood waters and check wells for broken pipes or flooding.   Authorities warned about 300 people staying in shelters Thursdayto wait one more day while emergency officials tried to resolveproblems with raw sewage, water 5 feet deep in homes along theManatee River and power failures in homes with standing water.</TEXT></DOC>
