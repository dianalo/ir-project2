Section 118.205 states that no publicfunds can be used for this purpose; 188.210 states that publicemployees cannot, within the scope of their employment, engage insuch speech; and 188.215 forbids such speech in public facilities.The Court of Appeals ... held that all three of these provisionswere unconstitutionally vague and that ``the ban on using publicfunds, employees and facilities to encourage or counsel a woman tohave an abortion is an unacceptable infringement of the woman's 14thAmendment right to choose an abortion after receiving the medicalinformation necessary to exercise the right knowingly andintelligently.''   Missouri has chosen only to appeal the Court of Appeals'invalidation of the public funding provision ... A majority of thecourt agrees with appellees that the controversy ... is now moot ...We accordingly direct the Court of Appeals to vacate the judgment ofthe District Court with instructions to dismiss the relevant part ofthe complaint. ...   Section 188.029 of the Missouri Act provides:   ``Before a physician performs an abortion on a woman he hasreason to believe is carrying an unborn child of 20 or more weeksgestational age, the physician shall first determine if the unbornchild is viable by using and exercising that degree of care, skill,and proficiency commonly exercised by the ordinarily skillful,careful, and prudent physician engaged in similar practice under thesame or or similar conditions. In making this determination ofviability, the physician shall perform or cause to be performed suchmedical examinations and tests as are necessary to make a finding ofthe gestational age, weight, and lung maturity of the unborn childand shall enter such findings and determination of viability in themedical record of the mother.''   As with the preamble, the parties disagree over the meaning ofthis statutory provision. ...   The Court of Appeals read 188.029 as requiring that after 20weeks ``doctors must perform tests to find gestational age, fetalweight and lung maturity.'' The court indicated that the testsneeded to determine fetal weight at 20 weeks are ``unreliable andinaccurate'' and would add $125 to $250 to the cost of an abortion....   We must first determine the meaning of 188.029 under Missourilaw. Our usual practice is to defer to the lower court'sconstruction of a state statute, but we believe the Court of Appealshas ``fallen into plain error'' in this case. ...   We think the viability-testing provision makes sense only if thesecond sentence is read to require only those tests that are usefulin making subsidiary findings as to viability. ...   The viability-testing provision of the Missouri Act is concernedwith promoting the state's interest in potential human life ratherthan in maternal health. ...   In Roe v. Wade, the court recognized that the state has``important and legitimate'' interests in protecting maternal healthand in the potentiality of human life. During the second trimester,the state ``may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure inways that are reasonably related to maternal health.''   In the first place, the rigid Roe framework is hardly consistentwith the notion of a constitution case in general terms, as ours is,and usually speaking in general principles, as ours does. The keyelements of the Roe framework _ trimesters and viability _ are notfound in the text of the Constitution or in any place else one wouldexpect to find a constititional principle. ...   In the second place, we do not see why the state's interest inprotecting potential human life should come into existence only atthe point of viability, and that there should therefore be a rigidline allowing state regulation after viability but prohibiting itbefore viability. ...   The tests that 188.029 requires the physician to perform aredesigned to determine viability. ... We are satisfied that therequirement of these tests permissibly furthers the state'sinterests in protecting human life and we therefore believe 188.029to be constitutional.   The dissent takes us to task for our failure to join in a ``greatissues'' debate as to whether the constitutional includes an``unenumerated'' general right to privacy. ...</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
