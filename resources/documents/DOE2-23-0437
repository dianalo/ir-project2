<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-23-0437 </DOCNO><TEXT>A description of the flux-flow state in five Cu/Nb 46.5 wt.% Ti multifilamentarycomposites having been subjected to various thermomechanical treatmentsis given solely in terms of two mechanisms: the motion of core defectswithin the flux-line-lattice and the peak effect. Data are presentedat 4.24 K and 2.5 K characterizing the E-J transitions up to the uppercritical field along with high accuracy measurements of the criticaltemperature. The interrelationships between the different microstructuresand these flux-flow data, governed by universal scaling laws, are considered.The fabrication of the composites is also described.</TEXT></DOC>
