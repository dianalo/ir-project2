RobertsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> PAC SBCTELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL)EARNINGS (ERN) </IN><TEXT>   Pacific Telesis Group's first-quarter profit rose 7.1% on a slight increase in revenue, while Southwestern Bell Corp.'s earnings slipped 3.4% on a 2.2% drop in revenue.    The results by the two Bell holding companies reflect contrasting regional economies. San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis, whose phone company units serve economically vibrant California and Nevada, showed growing demand for service. On the other hand, the five-state territory served by St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell includes Texas and Oklahoma, whose economies are tattered.    Pacific Telesis had net income of $293.3 million, or 68 cents a share, compared with year-earlier profit of $273.9 million, or 64 cents a share, adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split. Revenue rose 1% to $2.24 billion from $2.22 billion.    The company's earnings reflect a return on equity of 15%, almost exactly the earnings cap imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission.    Southwestern Bell posted net income of $237.7 million, or $2.37 a share, compared with $246.1 million, or $2.47 a share, a year earlier. Revenue declined to $1.88 billion from $1.92 billion.    Pacific Telesis, however, may have to restate its earnings downward because of $191 million in annual rate cuts that California regulators have ordered and $225.1 million in annual cuts that they may order. In a statement disclosing its results, Pacific Telesis vowed to fight to the California Supreme Court the rate cuts ordered by state regulators last month. The company, which has asked regulators to reconsider the entire rate-cut issue, also requested a delay of the cuts until after that review.    If the company ultimately has to implement the ordered cuts, it will have to restate first-quarter profit downward by $27.6 million to $265.7 million, or 62 cents a share. That would result in a 3% drop from year-earlier earnings.    In addition to the ordered cuts, the regulators are still considering the second phase of a rate case that began two years ago. They could order additional cuts later this year totaling $225.1 million. The cuts would be retroactive to March 1976 and would force Pacific Telesis to restate the latest quarter's results downward by an additional $117.5 million.    In St. Louis, Zane E. Barnes, Southwestern Bell's chairman and chief executive officer, said the company continues &quot;to be disappointed with (the) lack of revenue growth.&quot; He added, however, that the company anticipated the results &quot;in light of the continued weak regional economy.&quot;    The revenue results of Pacific Telesis and Southwestern Bell showed the impact of reductions in long-distance connection charges ordered last year by the Federal Communications Commission.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Pacific Telesis shares closed at $25, up 75 cents, and Southwestern Bell shares rose $2.125 to close at $105.50. </TEXT></DOC>
