Most of the nearly 500 bank examiners queried by theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. said that the commercial realestate market is still crawling but that it isn't worsening.They also said residential markets are improving. Mostexaminers noted an excess supply of both commercial andresidential real estate.</LP><TEXT>   The bank regulators also indicated that bank lendingstandards for real estate remain tight but that they aren'tgetting any tougher.   &quot;In all areas we are finding improvement, but obviously inthe commercial area, we are still in serious trouble,&quot; saidWilliam Seidman, chairman of the FDIC.   The best news was in the home sector, where the majorityof regulators said that the overall residential market was &quot;alittle better&quot; than the last survey in April. The mostpositive responses came from the Midwest and the West.   Bolstering the news, the Commerce Department reported thatsales of new single-family homes rose a brisk 7.4% in June,and home sales for March and April also were revised upward.&quot;This is a little better than we anticipated, but it'scertainly not a blowout,&quot; said Michael Giliberto, a realestate analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. The single-familyhome sale report is often substantially revised.   The FDIC uses the survey to compile an index to establishreal estate trends. A value above 50 indicates a majority ofthe bank examiners believed real estate values were improvingrather than declining; a value below 50 indicates theopposite. The July index rose to 64 from 61 in April, whichwas the first such survey. The FDIC plans to survey bankregulators during one month each quarter.   The FDIC hopes to use the survey to help forecast futurebanking industry results. Because of record losses, theFDIC's bank insurance fund is expected to run out of fundssometime after the fiscal year ends Sept. 30. Congress isconsidering a bill to recapitalize the fund, but the bill maybe bogged down in a fight over broader bank powers. &quot;I thinkit would be wise for them to act by October to insure that wedon't have a problem,&quot; Mr. Seidman said.   But Mr. Seidman also noted that stabilized real estatevalues could portend good news for banks, particularly asthey continue to pile on real estate loans. Real estate loansare now 25% of their lending, with about half of that in homemortgages. Recently, the FDIC scaled back its estimate ofbank failures for 1991 to about 400, but predicted more in1992, in part because of real estate woes. &quot;Next year doesnot look good, but these reports on real estate may improvethat,&quot; he said.   The West Coast is the most worrisome real estate area, Mr.Seidman said, with &quot;new stresses,&quot; particularly in SouthernCalifornia. The South, meanwhile, which regulators feared wasworsening, has improved.   Steep office vacancy rates in some cities continued toclimb. Office vacancies, which averaged 20.3% between 1988and 1989 for Albuquerque, N.M.; Hartford, Conn.; Long Island,N.Y.; Phoenix, Ariz.; San Diego and Ventura County, Calif.,rose to 23.5% this year.   Office vacancy rates are worse than that -- but improving-- in Dallas; Houston; Austin, Texas; Palm Beach, Calif.; andmid-state New Jersey.</TEXT></DOC>
