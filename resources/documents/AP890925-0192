(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jerry Falwell offered Jim Bakker $300,000and other perks to keep his mouth shut after Falwell took over thescandal-ridden PTL, the TV ministry's chief builder testifiedMonday.   Falwell denied the account given by builder Roe Messner, whotestified for the defense at Bakker's fraud trial.   Messner also said a chief Bakker aide claimed Bakker knewnothing about $265,000 in hush money to Jessica Hahn, the churchsecretary with whom Bakker had a sexual encounter in 1980.   Bakker is accused of defrauding followers by using more than$3.7 million in ministry money to live in high style. The TVevangelist faces up to 120 years in prison and more than $5 millionin fines if convicted on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.   Falwell, founder of the now defunct Moral Majority, took overPTL in 1987 after Bakker resigned in the scandal involving Ms. Hahn.   Messner testified that the offer to Bakker from Falwell includeda maid, a security guard and telephone expenses if Bakker ``kepthis mouth shut.''   Messner said Bakker wrote at the bottom of the piece of paper:``I'm not making any demands on PTL. I'm not asking for anything.''   It was not immediately clear whether Bakker turned down thealleged offer. Messner was not questioned further about the matter.   Mark DeMoss, a Falwell spokesman, said in a telephone interviewthat Messner was mistaken. The offer actually was a demand fromBakker, DeMoss said.   Falwell dispatched Messner to Palm Springs, Calif., to talk toBakker, but he carried no offer, DeMoss said. Messner returned witha handwritten list of demands on the pink stationery of Bakker'swife, Tammy, DeMoss said.   DeMoss said Bakker's demands included hospital insurance,Bakker's $300,000 annual salary for life, Tammy Bakker's $100,000annual salary for life, royalties on inspirational books andrecordings made by the Bakkers, secretary and maid service for ayear, use of a South Carolina lakefront house and furniture andattorneys' fees.   ``Simply put, the items Roe Messner testifed that Rev. Falwellsent him out to offer Bakker were items that Bakker requested andMessner presented to Rev. Falwell,'' DeMoss said. ``I would like tothink Roe just forgot the sequence of events.''   Messner testified that he handled the $265,000 payment to Ms.Hahn. He said he was called by Richard Dortch, PTL's executive vicepresident, on Feb. 21, 1985.   Dortch told Messner that if he didn't pay a woman from New York$265,000 then she would go to The Charlotte Observer withallegations that Bakker raped her. Five days later, Messner said,he wired the $265,000 to an account number in California that wasgiven to him by Dortch.   Messner said he asked Dortch if Bakker knew about the payment.He said Dortch replied: ``No, I'm acting on my own.''   Messner said he agreed to make the payment in part because theAssemblies of God was named as the potential party in a lawsuitthreatened by Ms. Hahn. ``I didn't think the church ought to bedragged into this incident,'' Messner said.   Contributors to PTL who remain supportive of Bakker alsotestified.   ``I've always thought from the beginning that Jim Bakker was agiver,'' said Karl Garmager, a television director from Michigan.</TEXT></DOC>
