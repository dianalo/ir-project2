A comparison for sensitivities and detection limitsfor the conventional Si(Li) semiconductor and a high purity Ge detectoras well as the new HgI/sub 2/ detectors are given. Both radioisotopex-ray fluorescence and atomic absorption spectroscopy were used to determineniobium and its impurities in the different phases of the metallurgicalprocess to extract, separate and purity niobium from its ores using modifiedmethods that were used for the exploration part.</TEXT></DOC>
