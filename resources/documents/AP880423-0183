Some expressed outrage in the past nine months over Iran'sgunboat attacks on unarmed shipping and their own inability to doanything about them.   ``It's like being a world-class athlete who's always ready forthe event but never gets to participate,'' Cmdr. Paul X. Rinn,skipper of the U.S. frigate Samuel B. Roberts, said recently.   The sweeping policy change may encounter strong objections inCongress. Many lawmakers have opposed any step that could draw theUnited States into more confrontation with Iran, which has beenfighting neighboring Iraq for seven and a half years.</TEXT><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael S. Dukakis, the likely Democratic nominee,says he considers Republican George Bush ``extremely vulnerable''in a host of international matters and while a relative novice inforeign affairs, ``I also have some rather strongly held views.''   With a rare edge in his voice, Dukakis ran quickly through hisbrief against Bush, mentioning arms-for-hostages, support forformer Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, a ``failed and illegalpolicy in Central America,'' and ``seven precious years doingvirtually nothing'' about the Middle East.   ``What good is experience if that's what it produces?'' Dukakisasked, trying out a line for the general election that would bindBush to the policies of President Reagan.</TEXT><DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than 200 Soviet trucks andarmored vehicles lumbered out of the capital at dawn Saturday forLowgar province, where Moslem guerrillas have stepped up attacks asMoscow prepares its troops to withdraw.   Many ground convoys and transport planes have been leaving Kabulin recent days to resupply Soviet positions and the vulnerableAfghan army, according to residents and Western diplomats.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The white marble headstone on VladimirMikhalev's grave is a reminder in this bastion of World War IIvalor that he died in Afghanistan, but there is no monument tothose who fought the war the Soviets didn't win.   The Soviet Union's 115,000 troops are to begin the long-awaitedmarch home this spring. And the nation must deal with the problemof how to remember those who served and those who died inAfghanistan.   The human losses suffered since Soviet soldiers enteredAfghanistan in December 1979 and the emotional wounds wereunmentionable topics in 1981, when Mikhalev, 23, was buried inChizhukovskoye cemetery among the heroes of World War II.</TEXT><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When an assassination team gunned down thePLO's No. 2 man at his villa in Tunisia, it was widely accepted asanother daring action by the long arm of Israel's fabled securityand intelligence services.   The slaying of Khalil Wazir 1,500 miles from Israel on April 16bore the fingerprints of the Mossad, the agency responsible foractivities outside Israel's borders. By all accounts it was quick,decisive, carried out with split-second timing and backed byIsrael's air and naval forces.   Israel's intelligence has been able to gather preciseinformation on locations of homes or installations and themovements of bodyguards. Teams have been able to make pinpointattacks and often escape without detection.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Not yet six months old, guidelines designed toproduce uniformity in sentencing federal convicts are promptingwidespread dissatisfaction among the judges who have to impose theprison terms.

He suggested the goal of the new rules, to make thepunishment fit the crime, will not always be met.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Major efforts to restore tropical forestscould bring an important slowdown in the expected ``greenhouseeffect'' warming of the earth, according to a study of forest needs.   Growing trees absorb carbon dioxide, the principal gasresponsible for the warming, and break the gas down to incorporatecarbon in their woody tissues. A growing forest also adds carbon tothe soil.   ``It does provide an important lag time ... while we doimportant things in other areas, like re-orient national energypolicies,'' said Lori Heise, a researcher at the WorldwatchInstitute and one of the authors of the study released Saturday.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An internecine battle between two unionsrepresenting most of the nation's operating railroad personnel isflaring just as both are sitting down with the industry to open anew round of contract talks.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In 1963, Liberace was hospitalized inPittsburgh with a near-fatal illness and his doctors told him toput his affairs in order. He did, giving away most of hispossessions and spending thousands of dollars on gifts for friends.   After weeks in intensive care, the flashy entertainer recoveredand found himself rebuilding his life, physically and financially.   Never again, he vowed, would he give away his wealth at the whimof someone or something out of his control.   But now, a year after his death, Liberace's millions are thesubject of controversy again.
