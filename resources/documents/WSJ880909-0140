Subroto, the former oil minister of Indonesia and OPEC's secretary-general since July 1, yesterday confirmed that he couldn't get the two oil exporters to agree to equal production limits -- a stubborn hangover from their eight-year war. Iraq has made the limits a condition for returning to the cartel quota system.    The oil industry has been awaiting word on whether Mr. Subroto's trips to Tehran and Baghdad last week would help bring OPEC new cohesion and production discipline, specifically by resolving Iraq's refusal to accept a production quota less than Iran's 2.4 million barrels a day.    &quot;From my discussions, I have the distinct impression that both countries feel the issue is not parity, but the rebuilding of their economies,&quot; said Mr. Subroto, according to the news agency of the Vienna-based Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.    The report by the OPEC news agency was the first official accounting of Mr. Subroto's negotiations, and is likely to increase the already growing skepticism in world oil markets about the cartel's ability to slow rising output. OPEC estimates output at 19 million barrels a day, but outside monitors put it at 20 million barrels a day.    Nevertheless, world oil prices generally rallied yesterday after several days of declines. In active futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude rose 32 cents a barrel to close at $14.48. European spot markets also had an active trading day with North Sea Brent crude up around five cents a barrel. But traders said the increases were in part because of a big drawdown in crude inventories shown in this week's release of U.S. oil statistics by the American Petroleum Institute.    Another bullish note was an official report from Kuwait that OPEC's price-monitoring committee of five leading oil ministers would meet soon because of recent sharp declines in petroleum prices. But a senior OPEC official expressed doubt a meeting will take place now because of the outcome of the Iraq-Iran talks.    The offsetting bearish news included further reports of price cuts by Saudi Arabia. According to the Dow Jones International Petroleum Report, Saudi Arabia effectively reduced by 10 cents a barrel the prices it charges four U.S. oil companies for crude oil purchased under contract for delivery to Far Eastern destinations. The Saudi move follows earlier reports of a decision effectively to reduce prices to Japanese customers by 20 cents a barrel next month.    Mr. Subroto returned to Vienna Wednesday from his latest &quot;fact-finding&quot; tour of oil-exporting countries and then left yesterday for a two-week personal visit to the U.S. But a senior OPEC official said Mr. Subroto made it clear that he hadn't expected to settle the quota issue with single visits to Iraq and Iran.    Also, the OPEC news agency quoted Mr. Subroto as saying that while both Iraq and Iran need maximum revenue to rebuild their economies, they would prefer a &quot;high price, low volume of production&quot; over high oil volumes and the resulting low price.    Mr. Subroto said that &quot;intensive consultations&quot; among OPEC's 13 member-nations are necessary to find solutions to their problems. Among the problems, in addition to the Iraq-Iran issue, he cited the need to fine-tune OPEC's pricing policy and to prevent oversupply.    If OPEC produced less, Mr. Subroto said, the price will firm. He estimated fourth-quarter demand for OPEC oil at 19 million barrels a day unless the world's high oil inventories are drawn down. </TEXT></DOC>
