Keller   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>06/28/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A3</SO><CO>   T</CO><IN>TELEPHONE SYSTEMS (TLS)COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (CMT)COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)CDS, INTEREST RATES, COMMERCIAL PAPER (FIN)BANKS (BNK)</IN><LP>   NEW YORK -- American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., citinglower equipment sales and the costly startup of its newcredit card, said second-quarter earnings will likely fallbelow those in the year-earlier quarter.   ATandamp;T's announcement knocked the wind out of the company'sstock and led analysts to lower their estimates for thesecond quarter, as well as full-year forecasts for 1990 and1991. Many also downgraded ATandamp;T stock to &quot;hold&quot; from &quot;buy.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,ATandamp;T fell $2.125 to $39.125 on volume of 11.5 million shares,making the stock the most-active Big Board issue yesterday.ATandamp;T's normal daily volume is 1.8 million shares. The declinealso lopped about $2.34 billion off ATandamp;T's marketcapitalization, given the company's nearly 1.1 billion sharesoutstanding.   While ATandamp;T said second-quarter earnings will probably belower than the $699 million, or 65 cents a share, in the 1989period, the company still expects 1990 earnings to surpass1989's profit of $2.7 billion, or $2.50 a share.   &quot;We expect to have a record year this year in terms ofearnings and our objective continues to be a mininum 10% to12% {annual} increase in earnings,&quot; said Morris Tanenbaum,ATandamp;T vice chairman and chief financial officer. While &quot;wethink it will be difficult to hit our objective, we will makeevery effort to do that.&quot;   ATandamp;T's profit problem underscores the magnitude ofChairman Robert E. Allen's high-wire challenge at ATandamp;T. Hiscampaign to slash costs, refine ATandamp;T's management structureand protect the company's &quot;golden-goose&quot; long-distancebusiness has been highly successful. ATandamp;T had record profitin 1989, and the company recently boosted its dividend forthe first time since the court-ordered breakup in January1984.   However, problems in ATandamp;T's office phone systems andcomputer businesses continue to drain profits. Also,potentially lucrative ventures such as credit cards andinternational businesses are demanding huge start-up fundsand are years away from delivering the kinds of profits thatcan offset losses elsewhere.   Analysts were quick to point out that ATandamp;T's problem inthe second quarter doesn't portend a calamity. &quot;This is far,far, far from being any kind of a catastrophe,&quot; said Jack B.Grubman, telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber Inc. &quot;Ifthere's a silver lining in this news it is that the corebusiness, long-distance, is healthy as ever. . . . And whilethe new credit card will cause short-term blips in earnings,ATandamp;T has been signing up a boat load more customers than itthought it would by now, meaning it will reach critical massto make money faster.&quot;   ATandamp;T has signed up more than two million cardholders --even after rejecting 40% of all applicants, notes Mr.Grubman. The company recently said purchases with itsUniversal MasterCard and Visa cards totaled more than $100million, excluding revenue from phone call charges.   Nonetheless, Mr. Grubman lowered his per-share estimatesfor the second quarter to 58 cents from 72 cents, and to$2.65 for 1990 from $2.90. For 1991, he now expects ATandamp;T toearn $2.95 a share instead of $3.40. Mr. Grubman was one ofseveral analysts who cut his recommendation to a &quot;hold&quot; froma &quot;buy.&quot;   &quot;Investors have been paying a hefty premium {based on}ATandamp;T's long-distance business,&quot; said Robert B. Morris III, ananalyst at Goldman Sachs. The announcement &quot;refocuses themarket's attention on ATandamp;T's exposure to product life-cyclesand the economy {in addition to being} just a long-distancecompany.&quot;   Mr. Morris, who has had ATandamp;T stock as a &quot;hold&quot; for thepast six months, lowered his second-quarter per-shareestimate to 60 cents from 72 cents, and cut his forecast for1990 to $2.60 a share from $2.80. For 1991, he expects ATandamp;Tto earn $3 a share, down from $3.15 a share.   In the first quarter, ATandamp;T's revenue from product sales,including telephone and computer equipment, increased 1.2% to$2.72 billion. In 1989, equipment sales rose 1.7% to $11.5billion, while profit margins flattened out and costs rose6.1% to $6.97 billion.   These numbers have led analysts to speculate that ATandamp;Twill have to dump some of its equipment businesses. Many havelong held ATandamp;T's communications equipment operations, whichinclude office phone switches and computers, to beexpendable. Mr. Grubman estimates that ATandamp;T's losses are $400million to $500 million a year on business systems and $300million on computers.   &quot;The equipment business basically stinks,&quot; said Mr.Grubman. &quot;ATandamp;T should take a look at exiting some of thesebusinesses.&quot;   &quot;A driving factor in PBX {office phone switch} sales iscompany relocations,&quot; said George Kelly, an analyst at MorganStanley andamp; Co. &quot;When a company moves it usually buys a newphone system, and with the real estate market down . . . thisis affecting ATandamp;T's sales.&quot;   Mr. Tanenbaum said there are &quot;absolutely no plans to exitor sell&quot; any of ATandamp;T's equipment businesses. And Mr. Allensaid: &quot;Be assured, the anticipated lower second-quarterearnings will not lead to any short term `fixes' that willhandicap the business over the long haul.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
