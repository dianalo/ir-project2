He works for a scandal-plagued enterprise that is certain to go out of business in 19 months. How can he keep jobs filled under such conditions?    Mr. Tuttle is director of presidential personnel in the White House, and the situation he confronts hasn't been faced by anybody since the days of Dwight Eisenhower. A two-term president is in the final stages of his administration, without any chance for reelection. So the White House must figure out how to keep desks filled in its waning days.    Mr. Tuttle insists that, much to his surprise, he doesn't yet face a problem keeping jobs filled. So far, he says, &quot;when we have a vacancy, there are usually five or six people who want it.&quot;    But the Reagan administration has been looking for about three months for acceptable nominees to head the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and it has been turned down by some it has sought out for other jobs, suggesting that top-quality candidates are starting to shy away.    Moreover, personnel experts think it's inevitable that there will be more and more vacancies in the 4,280 full-time presidentially appointed positions. Carter administration officials who stayed to the end often had trouble finding work afterwards and concluded that it is smartest to &quot;get the hell out before the administration ends,&quot; says G. Calvin Mackenzie, a vice president of Colby College who has studied presidential appointments for the National Academy of Public Administration.    So Mr. Tuttle is developing a strategy for filling jobs that come open in the administration's closing months. For starters, his office has drawn up a list of every deputy assistant cabinet secretary and other high-level bureaucrat who can easily be promoted to fill vacancies.    &quot;Let's face it,&quot; Mr. Tuttle says. &quot;The closer we get to the end, the more likely we are to promote from within.&quot;    Mr. Tuttle also says that he can draw from a pool of high-level business executives and university administrators who want the experience of serving in government but don't want careers in Washington. Thus, they are attracted by the short-term commitment involved in finishing out the Reagan administration.    Administration officials cite, for example, Charles E. Cobb Jr., the former head of Arvida Corp., who is expected to be nominated today as assistant secretary of commerce for trade development. And they say that a senior partner in a large executive search firm has discussed taking a job as the administration's alternate representative to the United Nations.    Another source of job candidates, Mr. Tuttle says, will be people who think another Republican administration will follow Mr. Reagan's and who want to be in on the ground floor as that new administration begins filling jobs.    Above all, though, Mr. Tuttle is hoping that he won't have many empty spots to fill. He bases his hope on statistics he cites suggesting that the administration has done well so far in keeping presidential appointees on the job.    Mr. Tuttle's office says cabinet secretaries in the Reagan administration have served an average of 41 months, longer than the average in the Carter administration or the combined Nixon-Ford and Kennedy-Johnson administrations.    Mr. Tuttle's office also calculates that the average length of service in the government for all Reagan appointees is 32 months; some studies have suggested that the average tenure in government for a presidential appointee in recent administrations is 20 months.    Still, personnel experts dispute the significance and accuracy of those statistics. Some believe that any success the Reagan administration has had in keeping people on board can be attributed in large part to the fact that Mr. Reagan now has been in office for nearly two full terms.    They also are sure that there will be more attrition. For one thing, some administration officials are certain to leave to go to work for Republican presidential candidates. For instance, Mari Maseng, the director of the White House office of public liaison, has just decided to leave her job to go to work for Sen. Robert Dole's presidential campaign. Others will be leaving for private industry; Albert Brashear, a deputy White House press secretary, is leaving to go to work for Motorola Inc.    There also is mounting evidence that the administration will have trouble luring its top choices into such positions. Rudolph Giuliani, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, turned down an offer to become chairman of the SEC. Similarly, industry sources say that at least four people turned down offers from the administration to fill a vacancy on the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. </TEXT></DOC>
