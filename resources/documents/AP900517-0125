Britain, France and the United States support West Germany'scall for a reunified Germany to be part of NATO. But the SovietUnion _ the fourth of the big World War II victors _ argues thatthe new Germany should be neutral, or a member of both NATO and theWarsaw Pact.   What's clear, Bush said, ``is that the United States and theFederal Republic of Germany share the same approach and have thesame goals regarding German unification.''   ``We both want a united Germany which enjoys full sovereignty, aunited Germany which is a full member of the Western community andof the NATO alliance, including participation in its integratedmilitary structures,'' he said.   Bush said that a reunified Germany should ``have full controlover all of its territory without any new, discriminatoryconstraints on German sovereignty.''   He said he and Kohl agreed that U.S. forces should ``remainstationed in the united Germany and elsewhere in Europe to continueto promote stability and security.''   Kohl thanked Bush for the ``magnificent support'' he had given``Germans on our path to German unity.''   Kohl said that a reunified Germany must remain a member of NATO_ but he urged that the alliance concentrate more on its politicalrole than its military one.   ``As the threat is decreasing appreciably, the alliance mustkeep the initiative in the field of disarmament and arms controland review its strategy and structure,'' he said.   Earlier, at an Oval Office picture-taking session, Kohl said hecould not say whether German unity would come before the end of theyear _ even though he had said earlier that all-German electionscould come as early as Dec. 2.   ``Nobody knows that. We know that the people are shouting, `weare the people.' This is why nobody can fix an exact date. Buteverything's going very well. We can say that.''   Kohl's Christian Democratic Party lost two West German stateelections on Sunday, which some analysts saw as a reflection ofconcern by voters over the cost and pace of reunification.   Kohl said he intended to discuss the issue with Bush, althoughadded that Bush is well versed on the issue already.   ``I think it's been rare to find a president in the history ofthe United States who knows German history and German politics sowell as this president. And European politics,'' said Kohl,speaking through a translator.   ``And that of course is a lucky thing for us. And I think thatyou should write that,'' Kohl told reporters.   ``So do I,'' Bush chimed in.   Bush and Kohl were also expected to discuss arms control, troopsin Europe and the situation in the rebellious Soviet republics ofLithuania, Estonia and Latvia.   It was Bush's final face-to-face meeting with the nation's keyallies as he prepares for his summit in two weeks with SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a superpower conference Bush saysis strained by the Baltic standoff.   Kohl recently joined French President Francois Mitterrand inurging Lithuanian leaders to lower some of their demands and seek anegotiated settlement with the Kremlin.   Bush has urged restraint on both sides.   But administration sources said Bush is frustrated at lack ofprogress toward a resolution of the Baltic issue, particularly withrespect to Lithuania. The Kremlin maintains a partial economicblockade of the breakaway state.   Bush told a news conference Wednesday that the pressure theSoviet Union is applying to the Baltic states ``has certainly putsome tension on the summit'' between himself and Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev. They meet in Washington from May 30-June 3.   ``We want to see negotiations or dialogue or whatever you callit _ discussions between Gorbachev and the Lithuanians get going.And then I'd like to see the release of that economic pressure onLithuania. And that would clear the air fast,'' the president said.   On Wednesday, Lithuania's parliament offered to suspend laws ithas enacted since declaring the republic's independence if theKremlin agrees to negotiate. However, the resolution did notinvolve rescinding the March 11 declaration of independence as theKremlin demanded, a spokeswoman said.   Today's session with Kohl was the president's concluding sessionwith Western allied leaders before the summit. Last month he metwith British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Bermuda andMitterrand in Key Largo, Fla.   He also has met with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney andJapanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.</TEXT></DOC>
