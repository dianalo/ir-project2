But judging by telegrams pouring into Parliament, quite anumber of their constituents wish the other guys had won.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Free the Committee]&quot; cables Kondrat Ryleyev, a residentof the Krasnodar region, referring to the State Committee forthe State of Emergency that briefly seized power.   &quot;Stop the repressions against Communists,&quot; EkaterinaSkornyakova writes from the &quot;Red Tank&quot; sanatorium inGelendzhik. &quot;It's not democracy but dictatorship to suppresspeople you don't agree with.&quot; The coup leaders, she adds,&quot;are not criminals, but people who defended the unity of thestate better even than Stalin.&quot;   Marat Almukhametov, writing from Kazan, worries more aboutBoris Yeltsin, the Russian president who spearheadedresistance to the coup, than the emergency committee. &quot;Thereal coup is taking place today under the leadership ofYeltsin,&quot; he complains. The eight committee members &quot;werejust pawns in the game.&quot;   These telegrams, and many others like them, were sent thisweek, several days after the coup collapsed. Pinned up on aboard in the white marble-and-stucco lobby of the Parliament,they provide one of glasnost's oddest and most contradictoryexpressions.   One could be encouraged that free speech has now reachedsuch a level in the Soviet Union that people are willing tolend open support to a group arrested for treason. Or onecould be discouraged that there's so much sympathy with agroup that planned to turn the clock back on free speech anddemocracy.   &quot;If they had organized the Putsch a little better, therewould have been half a million telegrams like this,&quot; saysRoman Solntsev, a deputy from Krasnoyarsk, who describes thetelegram writers as &quot;shameful, terrible, like a terriblemachine inside of us.&quot;   In fact, the Parliament has been receiving around 300telegrams a day since its emergency session started onMonday. It keeps careful note of them in a red folder. Asurprisingly large number -- but not all -- either supportthe coup or voice rage against Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Gorbachev orboth.   Whichever side they take, the telegram writers are atleast honest about their true feelings -- more so perhapsthan their elected representatives. This week, manyParliament deputies have been seeking to portray themselvesas active opponents of the coup, even if that means bendingthe truth a little.   The voters have noticed.   &quot;Don't blame Gorbachev for the coup,&quot; cables an invalidfrom Vladivostok, who gives her name only as Ivanova. &quot;It'sthe Parliament deputies who are to blame; they just chatter alot and do nothing.&quot;   &quot;We demand you stop this anti-union hysteria,&quot; cables theRomanov family from Togliatti on the Volga, reprimandingdeputies for gabbling on while numerous republics declaretheir independence. &quot;Remember the results of the (March 1991)referendum, in which a majority of the population of theunion voted to maintain the U.S.S.R.&quot;   Mr. Gorbachev doesn't get much unequivocal support. &quot;Wemust have a referendum for or against Gorbachev. The peopledidn't choose him,&quot; writes Nikolai Tsurkov from the Kalugaregion.   Mr. Yeltsin seems to arouse stronger emotions. TimofeiStepanov wants him to be awarded the title, &quot;Hero of theSoviet Union,&quot; on behalf of the people, &quot;so that he has noright to refuse.&quot;   Ivan Chetin from the Perm region finds worrying parallelsbetween Mr. Yeltsin's recent moves to destroy the CommunistParty and repressions of Czarist times. &quot;They declaredemocracy, free speech and a free press in Russia. But terroris being carried out,&quot; he says, demanding: &quot;Explain that toyour constituents]&quot;   But some are softer, offering gentle support and advicerather than harsh commands. &quot;In this difficult hour, I askyou to support Gorbachev,&quot; writes Vladimir Rezutov fromLeningrad, who wants his hometown to become &quot;the capital ofour future democratic state.&quot;   &quot;In the beginning was the word, says the Bible. We are atthe beginning, and all we have is words,&quot; says Mr. Solntsev,the deputy, taking a last look at the board. &quot;The country issplit. You can see that.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
