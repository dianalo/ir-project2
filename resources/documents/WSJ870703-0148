The problem is, they aren't listening. And while Mr. Robertson's hold on his own flock so far appears unshaken, the scandal has severely damaged his already long-shot hopes of attracting to his campaign GOP conservatives who aren't evangelical Christians.    &quot;The Jim and Tammy affair has resurrected the whole Elmer Gantry image of TV preachers. It may be unfair, but unfortunately it's had a spillover affect on Pat Robertson,&quot; says Gary Jarmin, a political consultant to conservative Christian groups. When the Los Angeles Times asked voters about Mr. Robertson last July, half of those questioned said they were disinclined to vote for him; when the same question was asked this spring after the Bakker scandal broke, that number rose to 69%.    As the 57-year-old host of &quot;The 700 Club&quot; campaigned for president here recently in the sweltering Bible Belt, he refused to acknowledge that the Bakkers' sexual and financial misconduct has hurt him. But some political analysts believe that it has, and that it has diminished the likelihood that the religious right will put a major stamp on the 1988 GOP platform.    Political observers say the Bakker scandal is especially damaging to Mr. Robertson because of his efforts over the past two years to play down his own television-evangelist image -- including claims of having stopped several hurricanes in their tracks and his apparent faith healing episodes on &quot;The 700 Club.&quot; From the start of his campaign, Mr. Robertson has acknowledged that reinforcing his religious image would be &quot;the kiss of death&quot; politically. Instead, he has been emphasizing to secular groups his background as a Yale Law School graduate and the son of a U.S. senator, and his success as the founder of a $230 million broadcasting empire.    Now, though, with the scandal focusing renewed attention on his television-ministry background, Mr. Robertson is asserting that he can win the GOP nomination by appealing to evangelicals alone. &quot;It will take only seven million (votes) to win the nomination for the presidency,&quot; he said in Huntsville last week. &quot;. . . My (born-again Christian) base is 70 million. All I need is 10% to 20% and I've won.&quot;    Political analysts don't take that prospect seriously. But they also still consider Mr. Robertson to be a factor in the 1988 GOP nominating process. While the Bakker scandal has hurt Mr. Robertson where he already was weakest -- among mainstream voters who aren't born-again Christians -- it doesn't seem to have hurt him where he has his base: among the evangelical or born-again Christians.    Indeed, Mr. Robertson has been effective so far in mobilizing his Christian activists in selected states -- particularly where GOP convention delegates are chosen in caucuses. Recently in South Carolina, for example, evangelical activists nearly won a majority of GOP delegates in a preliminary skirmish. Mr. Robertson's forces are also expected to do well in Florida, whose upcoming August caucuses are the kind of setting where a low turnout could enable Robertson activists to swamp the process.    Even if he doesn't win the nomination, his followers hope he will do well enough to give him leverage to push their anti-abortion, pro-school-prayer agenda during the 1988 campaign. &quot;Despite all you hear about religion these days, I trust him,&quot; says Robertson backer Barbara East, who attended a $100-a-head fund-raiser for him recently at the Huntsville Space Museum and an enthusiastic rally for him later at the civic center. Earlier in the day, more than 650 supporters crowded into an overflow luncheon for Mr. Robertson in Montgomery.    &quot;It is time for religious men and women all over America -- for Christians -- to stand up and be counted,&quot; exhorted Mr. Robertson's deputy press secretary, former Reagan administration aide Ben Waldman, at each Alabama campaign stop last week. He explained that even though he is Jewish, he supports Mr. Robertson's presidential effort: &quot;For too long you've said politics is a dirty business. And it has been dirty, because of your absence,&quot; he told the born-again Christian audience.    The Americans for Robertson exploratory committee, which doesn't disclose details of its finances, claims to have raised and largely spent nearly $8 million so far, which is more than any other 1988 campaign committee. The Bakker debacle &quot;just doesn't seem to affect me at all,&quot; Mr. Robertson said last week, asserting that his committee's coffers have been growing by 30% a month since March, when the scandal broke.    What the scandal has damaged, he has said, is the fund-raising for his Virginia Beach, Va.-based Christian Broadcasting Network Inc., which recently canceled its free telephone prayer hotline and laid off several hundred employees. But some CBN executives, noting that donations have been falling off for more than a year now, privately suggest another reason: They say that Mr. Robertson's political campaign is competing with his ministry for the same dollars of the faithful.    Beyond these financial troubles, some Robertson aides are even more worried about a current Internal Revenue Service investigation of the tax-exempt CBN empire and its political offshoots. While the IRS has so far brought no charges against either the candidate or CBN, Robertson aides worry that the investigation, in the wake of the Bakker revelations, could stir new questions about Mr. Robertson's estimated $525,000 custom-built CBN parsonage, corporate jet and stable of thoroughbred horses.    The Robertson campaign has also been bedeviled by internal dissension. Some aides are upset that the campaign has set up phone banks to solicit the three million petition signatures that Mr. Robertson has said he would regard as the sign from God that he should formally declare his candidacy this September. And others are concerned that the campaign may be cutting legal corners. &quot;I had my own integrity to watch for and that's why I left,&quot; said Terry Koons, a born-again Christian and former stockbroker who organized the Iowa chapter of the Freedom Council, a Robertson political group that disbanded last year amid widespread complaints that it was bending federal tax and election laws. </TEXT></DOC>
