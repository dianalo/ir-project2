Boesky, his advisers and others by investors in the former arbitrager's $1 billion limited partnership.    U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack's refusal is a blow to several Wall Street firms named in the complaints, including the law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver andamp; Jacobson, which acted as Mr. Boesky's attorney in the partnership's offering; Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which acted as Mr. Boesky's investment banker; and Seligman Harris andamp; Co., a securities firm that the suits said helped Mr. Boesky attract investors.    Separate lawsuits were filed in March by Guinness PLC, the largest investor in Mr. Boesky's limited partnership, and by a group of other major investors. Both suits alleged that the investors were misled because offering documents for Mr. Boesky's partnership failed to disclose, among other things, the criminal violation to which Mr. Boesky later pleaded guilty. As previously reported, Mr. Boesky also paid a record $100 million to settle civil charges involving insider trading.    The judge's order stated that the suits involved &quot;factual disputes&quot; that can only be resolved through litigation. His ruling clears the way for lawyers in the cases to begin gathering documents and interviewing the cases' principals, including possibly Mr. Boesky.    Other defendants in the lawsuit include former investment bankers Dennis Levine and Martin A. Siegel, who have both pleaded guilty to leaking inside information to Mr. Boesky on pending mergers and acquisitions; Oppenheim, Appel, Dixon andamp; Co., Mr. Boesky's accountant; and three companies Mr. Boesky controlled. </TEXT></DOC>
