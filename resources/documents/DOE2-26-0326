<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-26-0326 </DOCNO><TEXT>A diquark-quark scattering model for the parity-violating asymmetry innucleon-nucleon scattering is described. Criticism of the model by Simoniusand Unger is refuted. The strong energy dependence of the result, andthe possibility of important non-valence contributions to the nucleonpolarization, both support the need for further measurements at Fermilaband at Brookhaven energies. 9 refs., 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
