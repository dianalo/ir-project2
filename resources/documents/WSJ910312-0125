The treatment process involves quicklime, a common mineralused to make cement. The EPA found that when mixed with oilysludge residues containing massive amounts of PCBs, quicklimeproduces a vigorous chemical reaction that destroys the toxicmaterial and leaves only three relatively safe byproducts --calcium chloride, water and carbon dioxide.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This discovery could have enormous implications,&quot; saidRobert J. Bowden, chief of the EPA's regionalemergency-response branch in Chicago. &quot;Based on our researchso far, it's very, very promising.&quot;   Much more work needs to be done, however, to determinewith certainty whether quicklime is an effective treatment.Moreover, the early EPA findings and the work of anunaffiliated laboratory haven't been subjected to peerreview, and no formal report of the research findings hasbeen published in an authoritative journal.   &quot;I don't think enough research has been done to really besure&quot; about the method, cautioned Donald T. Sawyer, a chemistat Texas Aandamp;M University who has done extensive research onPCBs. Detecting the disappearance of PCBs is easy, he said,but proving that all the chlorine became calcium chloride isdifficult. &quot;In other words, have you destroyed the PCBs, orjust changed them into molecules that are equally toxic?&quot;   Other questions about the lime treatment remainunresolved. For example, it isn't known whether the methodcould be used with PCBs deposited in sediment on the bottomof rivers, lakes and harbors.   The EPA's Mr. Bowden said the quicklime method costssubstantially less than incineration, the most widespread andcontroversial method of PCB disposal. Some experts contendthat burning PCBs safely is impossible because particlesescape into the atmosphere. And while incinerating a cubicyard of PCB-contaminated material can cost more than $500,the quicklime technique appears to cost only about $75.   PCBs have been linked to liver damage and cancer. Thechemicals were used widely in transformers, electrical motorsand electrical insulation before being banned in 1977. PCBsdischarged over the years by such major companies as GeneralElectric Co., Reynolds Metals Co. and Aluminum Co. of Americastill pose severe contamination problems for many ofAmerica's rivers, lakes and harbors.   PCBs have a highly stable molecular structure, so they arehard to break down. Many scientists have tried unsuccessfullyto &quot;dechlorinate&quot; PCBs chemically.   In 1987, EPA workers cleaning up an oil refinery inIndiana added quicklime to PCB-contaminated sludge. Lime, aningredient in cement, is routinely added to thicken thesludge and makes it easier to transport and burn. &quot;When wecame back a few months later to take some samples,&quot; said theEPA's Mr. Bowden, &quot;we couldn't find the PCBs anymore.&quot;   Specifically, EPA scientists found that the PCB content inmost samples had been reduced to a mere five parts permillion -- low enough not to pose a threat to people -- fromabout 2,000 parts per million. &quot;In one batch, there werenone,&quot; Mr. Bowden said.   He said a similar effect has since been recorded at twoother EPA cleanup sites. In addition, chemists at RMCEnvironmental andamp; Analytical Laboratories in West Plains, Mo.,were hired to conduct independent tests and replicated theresult.   The RMC tests isolated quicklime as the ingredientresponsible for the destruction of the PCBs. According to thetests, most of the destruction occurred within 72 hours. TheRMC team also found indications that trace levels of certaincontaminant metals in the quicklime work as catalysts in thevigorous chemical reaction. RMC wouldn't say what thecontaminants were.   The EPA says its own laboratory in Cincinnati will beginfurther research on the treatment process within a couple ofweeks. A formal report is expected after those tests arecompleted.   The safety and cost issues surrounding incineration ofPCBs have spurred several efforts to find alternatives. Forexample, GE has worked with biotechnology companies to speedup &quot;bioremediation&quot; of a contaminated 40-mile stretch of NewYork's Hudson River. Years ago, GE also experimented with atreatment using potassium hydroxide at high temperatures, butthat technique proved too costly.   According to state officials, about half of the estimated500,000 pounds of PCBs dumped from GE plants could beretrieved by dredging. But dredging also could stir upPCB-laden sediments and risk dispersing the chemicals to newareas, thus causing more ecological damage.   Daniel Abramowicz, GE's manager of environmentaltechnology, said he hadn't read any EPA description of thelime treatment, &quot;but it would be very exciting, if true,&quot;because it's so simple.   The EPA said there are indications the lime treatment alsoworks on other toxins, such as dioxin and strong pesticides.</TEXT></DOC>
