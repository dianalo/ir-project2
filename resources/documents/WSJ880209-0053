Schmitt (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> TNM BNK </IN><TEXT>   Standard Chartered PLC is on the verge of selling its Los Angeles-based Union Bank subsidiary to a Japanese bank for as much as $900 million, industry sources said.    If completed, the transaction would apparently be the largest Japanese investment ever in a U.S. financial institution. Last year, Nippon Life Insurance Co. invested about $500 million in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. while Sumitomo Bank Ltd. completed a similarly sized investment in Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. A group of Japanese banks and insurance companies last year purchased $350 million in BankAmerica Corp. securities.    A Standard Chartered spokesman in London and a Union Bank spokeswoman in Los Angeles separately declined to comment about the possibility of a sale.    The buyer's identity wasn't known. One senior official at a major U.S. bank said last Friday that Bank of Tokyo Ltd. was the leading contender. However, in trade publications, Bank of Tokyo has denied negotiating for Union Bank. In San Francisco, a spokesman for Bank of Tokyo's 77%-owned California First Bank declined to speak for the parent. The spokesman said California First, which has about one-third less in assets than Union Bank, has itself been actively seeking to expand, but it declined comment about any particular interest in Union Bank.    Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Sanwa Bank have also been mentioned as possible suitors, but California representatives of the two banks weren't aware of any involvement yesterday.    The expected price is below some estimates and appears to reflect a softening of prices being paid in banking mergers. The softening partly reflects newly proposed international bank capital guidelines, which bankers expect will force down prices as well as limit the field of purchasers to a select, well-capitalized few. Some analysts said the lower price may also reflect concern about the impact of the U.S. commercial real estate glut on Union's large construction-loan portfolio.    When Standard Chartered indicated last summer that it would consider selling Union Bank, some analysts expected a price of between two and three times shareholders' equity, or between $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion, based on equity of about $580 million at Sept. 30. The industry sources said Standard would likely receive a premium above the book value, indicating a range of perhaps $725 million to $900 million.    Still, the sale would provide some much-needed capital for Standard, and represent a premium over the $377 million that it paid to acquire Union in 1979. In contrast, Union Bancorp, Union's parent holding company, last month agreed to sell an Arizona bank to Citicorp for an estimated $210 million, just one year after Union bought the bank for $335 million. The Arizona bank has been hurt by real estate loan losses.    With $9.3 billion in assets as of Sept. 30, Union Bank is the fifth largest bank in California. It is a major real estate financier and lender to companies with sales between $5 million and $125 million, a banking &quot;middle-market&quot; that Japanese banks in the U.S. have increasingly coveted. Its individual banking efforts focus on a relative handful of affluent customers, rather than the mass market.    Lately, the bank's performance has been lackluster. It expects to report 1987 earnings of about $56 million, approximating year-earlier levels. Its profitability, in terms of return on assets, was 0.57% through the first nine months of 1987, compared with 0.63% a year earlier. The bank employs 4,300 people in 32 offices.    Japanese banks account for about 9% of U.S. banking assets, more than double the 1980 share. In California alone, the share in 1986, reflecting the latest data available, was 16%, compared with 12% in 1985. Japanese concerns own or control four of the state's 10 largest banks. </TEXT></DOC>
