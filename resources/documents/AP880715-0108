The U.S. missile frigate Robert G. Bradley responded to thedistress signal but did not confront the raiders, U.S. officialssaid.   The shipping executives identified the targeted vessel as the85,989-ton Sea Victory, operated by the Piraeus, Greece-basedEuropean Navigation Inc. They said the captain put out his distresssignal at about 2 p.m. and gave his location as five miles south ofFarsi island. The captain said the attack was carried out by twoIranian gunboats.   He was heard frantically shouting, ``American warship! Americanswarship!'' and within minutes he reported that the gunboats were``returning to attack,'' said the executives who monitored theradio calls.   The captain was still shouting for help when the gunboatsreturned a third time to raid the vessel, said the executives. Theysaid the attacks occurred within about 15 minutes.   The attacks caused a fire, which the crew extinguished.   In a radio telephone contact after the Iranians turned back, thecaptain was overheard by monitors as saying the Iranians attackedthree times, and he described the condition of his ship as coveredwith ``lots of holes.''   He was overheard saying ``no casualties, thank God,'' but healso said that his second officer suffered minor injuries.   In Washington, the Pentagon said in a statement that the tankerissued a call for help but was able to steam west under its ownpower. When it reached international waters, it no longer requiredassistance, the statement said.   A U.S. Navy spokesman in the gulf, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said the frigate Robert G. Bradley was on patrol in thegulf more than 20 miles away and responded to the call and headedtoward the tanker.   The Iranian gunboats did not pursue the tanker intointernational waters, said the spokesman.   The shipping executives, who also spoke on condition they not benamed, noted that the U.S. warship would not cross the 12-mileterritorial limit around Farsi, which would be Iranian waters.   Under the existing rules of engagement for the Navy, vessels indistress can be assisted only in international waters.   Since May 3, the Navy rules of engagement have been expanded topermit U.S. warships to intervene to stop attacks on neutralshipping in international waters, if the ships under attack are notcarrying war-related materials and if they ask for assistance.   It was the second raid by the Iranian gunboats in four days on atanker in the vicinity of Farsi, a stronghold for Iran'sparamilitary Revolutionary Guards.   About 550 commercial vessels of different nationalities havebeen caught in the tanker war. Iraq attacks ships sailing inIranian waters and Iran retaliates by raiding neutral shipping,particularly vessels linked to Kuwait or Saudi Arabia.   Iran accuses the two countries of aiding Iraq, its foe in thenearly 8-year-old war.   On Tuesday, the Iranian gunboats raided a Panamanian-registeredtanker, the 81,282-ton Universal Monarch, about 20 miles off Farsi,setting its engine room ablaze and causing extensive flooding.   The missile frigate Nicholas, on patrol in the area, had rushedto the assistance of the vessel and two of its helicopters tookfire from the raiding gunboats. No casualties were reported.   The raids on the Universal Monarch and the Sea Victory wereIran's apparent retaliations for Iraqi strikes on two tankers _ theGreek-owned Fellowship L and the Cypriot Star Ray _ a few daysearlier in the vicinity of Iran's vital Kharg Island oil terminal,also in the northern part of the gulf.</TEXT></DOC>
