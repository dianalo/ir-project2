France's state-owned telephone company said Friday it willopen for business in Britain with a high-speed datacommunications service. The French hope to have two millionusers in Britain within four years, an ambitious target that-- if achieved -- would cut deeply into British Telecom'sdominant position in the field.</LP><TEXT>   France Telecom's move is its most aggressive push so faroutside its home base and escalates a slowly growingcompetition for business among it, British Telecom, Germany'sDeutsche Bundespost Telekom and Europe's othertelephone-service giants. For decades, each phone companystuck to its home country, enjoying a state-controlledmonopoly over most communications services. But in the pastfive years, a Europe-wide trend towards telecommunicationsderegulation has eroded industry boundaries, allowingcross-border competition.   So far, the amount of money involved in this form ofinter-European competition is small, but it's growing rapidlyand roiling waters in what was once a sedate industry. Forall the European phone giants, called PTTs for their oldroles as national post, telephone and telegraph monopolies,their main targets are multinational corporations that movevast amounts of computerized data around the globe. Byoffering new services, technology or price scales, each PTTaims to lure the multinationals into routing more of theirglobal traffic through that PTT's territory.   France Telecom's move takes the new competition a stepfurther, by jumping directly into a rival PTT's home turf.British Telecom was actually the first European PTT to turnpoacher, when it bought the Tymnet telecommunications networkfrom McDonnell Douglas Corp. last year. That global network,one of several U.S.-built networks to carry multinationalfirms' data, has customers and equipment in France. In aseparate initiative, BT is discussing a possible alliancewith Germany's Telekom and Japan's Nippon Telegraph andamp;Telephone Corp. to manage the internal telecommunicationsnetworks of multinationals.   At a news conference here Friday, France Telecom officialsplayed down the competitive implications of their Britishinitiative. In its overall strategy, &quot;France Telecom seescooperation with other {telecommunications} carriers, ratherthan competition,&quot; said Fred Metzger, director general of thecompany's Transpac Network Services unit. Specifically, heabjured any France Telecom interest in competing with BT inits core business of providing Britain's basic telephoneservice. That's just as well, as the British governmentprobably wouldn't allow the French state-owned company sobold a step.   But France Telecom's plan is ambitious nonetheless. Mr.Metzgen said Transpac aims by the end of 1992 to assemble aUnited Kingdom-wide network of computerized switches andleased phone lines, describing the investment as &quot;millions ofpounds.&quot; As the first step, he said, Transpac last Aprilbought the internal datacommunications network of LondonRegional Transport, the British capital's bus and Undergroundauthority. The price paid for the Regional Transportorganization, with its 1,700 terminals, 80 processors, 100sites and 20 employees, wasn't disclosed. But the cash sumprobably wasn't large, because as part of the pact Transpacagreed to manage some Regional Transport data communications.   The service to be provided is called packet-switching, acommon method of transmitting computerized data in discrete&quot;packets&quot; of information, rather than as continous signals,over telecommunications lines. The service, similar to one inFrance for which Transpac has 5.5 million customers, is usedfor electronic mail, credit-card verification and many otherforms of computer communications.   In France, 45% of Transpac's packet-switched traffic and20% of its revenue comes from its Minitel terminals, whichact like electronic yellow pages. Transpac also plans tooffer Minitel services over its new British network.   British Telecom greeted the news of its new competitorwith a stiff upper lip. &quot;We welcome the competition,&quot; a BTspokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
