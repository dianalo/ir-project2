He was off the front page and scarcely a blip on the television news agenda. Mr. Reagan wasn't in hiding. He was in Brussels, participating in a NATO meeting. He even gave a speech. The president's publicists were as eager as ever to draw attention to him. But the media acted as if Mr. Reagan were spending a drowsy, inconsequential weekend with Nancy at Camp David.    Political power isn't what it used to be. Mr. Reagan, as president, is supposed to have more of it than everyone else in Washington. But he doesn't. Hedrick Smith, the author of &quot;The Russians&quot; and the longtime Washington hand for the New York Times, explains why. Mr. Reagan has lost what Mr. Smith says is the vital ingredient of a president's success, the &quot;ability to command public attention.&quot;    One thing is certain about political power in Washington: You know when you've lost it. But not much else is certain, or at least not in &quot;The Power Game: How Washington Really Works&quot; (Random House, 759 pages, $22.50). Mr. Smith sees power as ubiquitous. &quot;Information and knowledge are power,&quot; he writes. &quot;Visibility is power. A sense of timing is power. Trust and integrity are power. Personal energy is power; so is self-confidence. Showmanship is power. Likability is power.&quot; He goes on, but you get the drift.    Mr. Smith tells us about the power of presidents, secretaries of state, subcommittee chairmen, the staff in Congress and at the White House, pro-Israel lobbyists, the National Security Council, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the &quot;iron triangle&quot; that promotes Pentagon policies and the &quot;dissident triangle&quot; that opposes them, and senators who specialize in being prickly.    That's just for starters. Since power is fragmented in Washington, Mr. Smith feels compelled to examine every last shard of it. This makes his book exhaustive -- and exhausting. There is some dazzling reporting about the Reagan administration that I haven't seen anywhere else. But what is lost is a sense of proportion. Which shard of power is important and which isn't? How does a lame duck president stack up against a House speaker? Who has more clout: a key congressional staffer like Tony Battista of the House Armed Services Committee or an influential White House aide like communications director Tom Griscom? How big a role do lobbyists really play? I read every page of &quot;The Power Game&quot; and still am not sure.    Mr. Smith has excessively high regard for deal makers, strategists and permanent Washington fixtures. Robert Strauss, the Washington lawyer and former Democratic national chairman, is &quot;supremely successful as a power broker.&quot; What Mr. Strauss has brokered, Mr. Smith doesn't say. In Mr. Reagan's first term, Mr. Smith writes, &quot;it is impossible to exaggerate the importance to Reagan's success of Howard Baker's personal influence with Senate Republicans or of his relationship to {then-chief of staff} Jim Baker at the White House.&quot; Wrong. Mr. Smith himself exaggerates it egregiously. He also notes that Allan Gotlieb, the ambassador from Canada, and his wife, Sondra, &quot;took a lower profile for a while&quot; after Mrs. Gotlieb slapped her social secretary in public. &quot;But they are an intelligent, likable couple with a flair for entertaining, and their parties came back into fashion,&quot; Mr. Smith adds admiringly.    His preference for pragmatists leads Mr. Smith to misunderstand who was responsible for the most significant event of Mr. Reagan's second term, the enactment of tax reform legislation. He credits President Reagan and the managers of the bill, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, Senate Finance Committee chairman Robert Packwood and House Ways and Means Committee chairman Daniel Rostenkowski. True, they played parts, but only after the political climate was made conducive.    The people who managed this were Sen. Bill Bradley, Congressman Jack Kemp, and Donald Regan in his waning days as Treasury secretary. They put tax reform on the national agenda. Mr. Kemp talked up the need to slash tax rates. Mr. Bradley drafted a bill that both cut rates, pleasing conservatives, and knocked out loopholes, thrilling liberals. And Mr. Regan, not Jim Baker or the president, spurred the reform drive at a critical moment by issuing a simple tax plan that gored all special interests equally.    Mr. Smith concludes that the political system &quot;needs some neatening up.&quot; But not by taking advice from &quot;Washington bashers and visionaries.&quot; I take this to mean people, and I'm one, who view Washington as smug, bloated and dangerously disconnected from grass-roots America. Mr. Smith argues that now is the time &quot;to value the professional politicians whose records show they can balance the issues, sort out priorities, rally their ranks, and reach across party lines -- and keep reaching across -- to draw support there, too.&quot; I thought these were the folks who got us in trouble to begin with.    ---   Mr. Barnes is a senior editor of The New Republic. </TEXT></DOC>
