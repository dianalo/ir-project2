The invention      is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried      out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and      terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not      be regarded as limiting. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  GENERAL DESCRIPTION </PAC><PAR>  Shown in FIG. 1 of the drawings is a marine propulsion device which is in      the form of an outboard motor 11 although various of the features of the      invention are also applicable to stern drive units. The outboard motor 11      includes a transom bracket 13 adapted to be fixedly mounted to the transom      15 of a boat, and (see FIGS. 3 through 5) a swivel bracket 17 which is      pivotally mounted on the transom bracket 13 for vertical tilting movement      about a horizontal tilt axis 19 from a lowermost running position (shown      in FIG. 1) to a fully raised tilt position, i.e., through a trim range      beginning at the lowermost running position, and through a tilt range      extending from the upper end of the trim range and to a fully raised tilt      position. </PAR><PAR>  More particularly, the transom bracket 13 can be of any suitable      construction and comprises (see FIG. 20) a pair of horizontally spaced      port and starboard bracket portions or elements 21 and 22, respectively,      which are individually fixed to the boat transom 15 by any suitable means      such as bolts 23 (FIG. 3). </PAR><PAR>  Still more particularly as shown in FIGS. 20 and 21, the port and starboard      transom bracket elements 21 and 22 include respective rearward surfaces 24      and 26 having respective laterally inner edges 28 and 30 and respective      laterally outer edges 32 and 34. In addition, the inner lateral edges 28      and 32 include, centrally thereof, respective vertically elongated      recesses 36 and 38 which materially diminished the width of the rearward      surfaces 24 and 26. In addition, below the recesses 36 and 38, the      rearward surfaces 24 and 26 include respective sockets, notches or      recesses 335 and 337 which will be referred to again hereinafter and which      are adapted to receive the outer end of a trail arm 201 still to be      disclosed. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, and also more particularly, (see FIG. 5) the swivel bracket 17      includes a horizontal leg 23 having a forward end through which the tilt      axis 19 passes and a rearward end, as well as a generally vertical leg 25      which extends vertically downwardly from the rearward end of the      horizontal leg 23 and which includes a vertically extending steering axis      still to be described. The vertical leg 25 includes a transversely      projecting central portion 27 having an unbroken rearward surface 29      which, in general, extends, when the swivel bracket 17 is in the trim      range, between and adjacent the rearward surfaces 24 and 26 of the spaced      transom bracket elements 21 and 22. The rearward surface 29 of the central      portion 27 of the swivel bracket 17 includes (see FIG. 20) oppositely      laterally outwardly projecting wings 42 and 44 which extend into the      recesses 34 and 36 and into closely adjacent relation to the rearward      surfaces 24 and 26 of the transom bracket elements 21 and 22 and include      laterally spaced outer edges 46 and 48 extending in adjacent relation to      the transom bracket rearward surfaces 24 and 26. As also shown in FIGS. 5      and 20, the surface 29 of the swivel bracket 17 includes an arcuate      central portion curving about the below-described steering axis, and      generally vertical, generally planar side portions extending in opposite      directions from the central portion of the surface 29 and defining      therebetween an obtuse angle. In addition, the vertical leg 25 includes      (see FIG. 5) a forward surface 31 and a pair of horizontally spaced      forwardly projecting side surfaces or lugs 33 which respectively include      aligned apertures rotatably supporting respective thrust rollers 143 still      to be described. Still further, the swivel bracket includes a lower end or      portion 50 having laterally spaced lower portions 52 and 54. </PAR><PAR>  The outboard motor 11 also includes (see FIG. 1) a propulsion unit 51 which      is connected to the swivel bracket 17 for common movement therewith about      the tilt axis 19 and for pivotal movement relative to the swivel bracket      17 about a generally vertical steering axis 53 which has already been      mentioned. The propulsion unit 51 comprises a powerhead 55 including an      internal combustion engine 57, and a lower unit 59 including a drive shaft      housing 61 which, at its upper end, is fixedly connected to the powerhead      55, which includes a forward portion 62 extending in closely adjacent      relation to the rearward surface 29 of the central portion 27 of the      swivel bracket 17, and which, at its lower end, is fixedly connected to a      gearcase 63 rotatably supporting a propeller shaft 65 carring a propeller      67. The propeller shaft 65 is driven from the internal combustion engine      57 through a vertically extending drive shaft 69 within the drive shaft      housing 61 and through a reversing transmission 71 located in the gear      case 63 and connecting the drive shaft 69 to the propeller shaft 65. </PAR><PAR>  Hydraulic means are provided for pivoting the swivel bracket 17 and      connected propulsion unit 51 about the horizontal tilt axis 19 and      relative to the transom bracket 13. While other constructions can be      employed, in the illustrated construction, such means comprises (see FIGS.      3 and 21) a hydraulically actuated tilt and trim assembly 81. More      specifically, in the disclosed construction, the hydraulic tilt and trim      assembly 81 includes a hydraulic tilt cylinder/piston assembly 83      including a tilt cylinder 85 having a lower blind end pivotally connected      to the transom bracket 13 about a first or lower horizontal axis 87, and a      tilt piston rod 89 which extends from the other end of the tilt cylinder      85 and, at the outer end thereof, is pivotally connected to the swivel      bracket 17 about a second or upper horizontal axis 91. The tilt      cylinder/piston assembly 83 defines an axis 93 which extends generally      vertically at all times throughout tilting movement of the swivel bracket      17 and connected propulsion unit 51 in the trim and tilt ranges,      notwithstanding that the hydraulic tilt and trim assembly 81 pivots      somewhat about the lower horizontal axis 87 in response to tilting      movement of the swivel bracket 17. </PAR><PAR>  The hydraulic tilt and trim assembly 81 also includes a pair of laterally      aligned hydraulic trim cylinder/piston assemblies 95 which are      respectively fixed to the tilt cylinder 85 on opposite sides thereof and      which include respective trim cylinders 97 having blind or closed lower      ends and open rearward and upper outer ends. Extending from the trim      cylinders 97 are respective trim piston rods 99 having outer ends 101      which engage the swivel bracket 17 for forward thrust transmission when      the swivel bracket 17 is in the trim range. The trim cylinder/piston      assemblies 95 define respective axes 103 extending upwardly and rearwardly      at an angle of about 30.degree. to the axis 93 of the tilt cylinder/piston      assembly 83. Because the trim cylinders 97 are fixed to the tilt cylinder      85, the trim cylinder/piston assemblies 95 are pivotal about the lower      horizontal axis 87 in common with the tilt cylinder 85. Unlike the tilt      cylinder 85, the outer ends 101 of the trim piston rods 99 are free of      fixed connection with the swivel bracket 17 and, in fact, during swivel      bracket movement through the tilt range, the outer ends 101 of the trim      piston rods 99 are physically spaced from the swivel bracket 17. </PAR><PAR>  Any suitable means can be provided for supplying hydraulic fluid to the      tilt and trim cylinders 85 and 97 to effect movement of the tilt and trim      piston rods 89 and 99. While other constructions can be employed, in the      disclosed construction, the hydraulic tilt and trim assembly 81 includes      (see FIG. 21) a reversible electric motor and pump sub-assembly 111 which      is fixedly connected to the tilt cylinder 85 and which hydraulically      connects with a sump or reservoir sub-assembly 115 which is also fixedly      connected to the tilt cylinder 85. In particular, the tilt and trim      assembly 81 includes a one-piece bracket or casting 121 which provides      both the tilt cylinder 85 and the trim cylinders 97 and which includes      mounting surfaces 123 and 125 to which the motor and pump sub-assembly 111      and the reservoir sub-assembly 115 are fixedly connected by any suitable      means. In addition, a suitable conduit system (not shown) is provided      internally of the tilt and trim assembly bracket 121. </PAR><PAR>  Any suitable means can be employed to actuate the reversible electric motor      and pump assembly 111. In the disclosed construction, such means comprises      a two button switch (not shown) located at the port side of the outboard      motor 11 and preferably mounted in (see FIG. 1) a lower motor cover or      cowl 127. </PAR><PAR>  The outboard motor 11 also includes means for transmitting forward thrust      from the swivel bracket 17 to the trim piston rods 99 when the swivel      bracket 17 is in the trim range, and notwithstanding variation in the      angular location of the swivel bracket 17 relative to the transom bracket      13 and the angular location of the hydraulic tilt and trim assembly 81      relative to the transom bracket 13. </PAR><PAR>  While other constructions can be employed, the disclosed construction is      particularly adapted to minimize wear and, at the same time, improve the      appearance of the outboard motor. More particularly, the outer end 101 of      each of the trim piston rods 99 is provided with an enlarged head 131      having an outer abutment surface 133 which extends in a plane      perpendicular to the trim piston axes 103. When the swivel bracket 17 is      in the trim range, the enlarged heads 133 respectively engage thrust      rollers 141 which are carried by the before mentioned projections or lugs      33 for rotary movement about a common horizontal axis 143. More      particularly, each thrust roller 141 is rotatably supported on a      shouldered stud or mounting bolt 145 which provides a cylindrical bearing      surface and which is threaded into the associated one of the side surfaces      or lugs 33. Preferably the cylindrical bearing surfaces are coated with a      suitable film to minimum wear. Because the thrust rollers 141 are      supported on the horizontally extending mounting bolts 145 which are      threaded into the side surfaces or lugs 33, the thrust rollers 141 are      readily accessible from the side for replacement by unthreading the      mounting bolts 145 and when the propulsion unit is raised only slightly      out of the trim range. </PAR><PAR>  Because the side surfaces or projections or lugs 33 extend forwardly of the      central swivel bracket portion 27, the rearward surface 29 of the central      portion 27 of the swivel bracket 17 remains, as mentioned, unbroken and      extends, in general (and as seen in FIG. 20), between and generally      bridges and smoothly merges with the spaced transom bracket elements 21      and 22 and, in general, also extends in covering relation to the hydraulic      tilt and trim assembly 81 when the swivel bracket is in the trim range. </PAR><PAR>  Furthermore, the enlarged size of the heads 131 and the use of the thrust      rollers 141 which engage the heads 131, and which are rotatable about the      common horizontal axis 143 permit thrust transmission along a line of      contact, as opposed to a point, thereby reducing wear, and provides      rolling contact along the flat outer abutment surfaces 133 during relative      movement between the trim piston rods 99 and the thrust rollers 141      resulting from movement of the swivel bracket 17 through the trim range,      thereby also minimizing wear. </PAR><PAR>  The outboard motor 11 also include means for selectively retaining the      propulsion unit 51 in three positions within the tilt range, i.e., in a      fully raised or full or high-tilt position at the upper end of the tilt      range, in a low-tilt position angularly spaced below the full or high-tilt      position, and in a less raised trail position angularly spaced below the      low-tilt position, but above the trim range. </PAR><PAR>  The three position retaining means comprises (see FIG. 2) a trail arm 201      which will be described further hereinafter and which holds the propulsion      unit 51 in the trail position, and means for selectively holding the      propulsion unit 51 in the high-tilt and low-tilt positions. </PAR><PAR>  While other constructions can be employed, the means for selectively      holding the propulsion unit in the high and low-tilt positions includes      (see FIGS. 5 through 13) a swivel bracket holding lever or member 211      which is mounted on one of the transom bracket 13 and the swivel bracket      17 for engagement with the other of the transom bracket 13 and swivel      bracket 17 and which is moveable between three positions, i.e., a park or      non-use position (see FIG. 11), a low-tilt position (see FIG. 12), and a      high-tilt position (see FIG. 13). </PAR><PAR>  Still more particularly, in the disclosed construction, the swivel bracket      holding lever or member 211 is pivotally or rotatably carried by a      mounting bolt or shouldered screw 213 received in (see FIG. 6) a mounting      aperture 214 in the swivel bracket holding lever or member 211 and      threaded into the starboard side of the upper leg 23 of the swivel bracket      17 for movement of the swivel bracket holding lever or member 211 about a      horizontal pivot axis 215 and for movement into and in engagement with a      portion 217 of the upper surface of the transom bracket 13. </PAR><PAR>  Even more particularly, in the disclosed construction, the swivel bracket      holding lever or member 211, except for the mounting aperture 214, is a      solid piece, preferably of metal, and includes a low-tilt bearing surface      219 which is located, when the swivel bracket holding lever or member 211      is in the park position, generally above the mounting aperture 214 and in      a plane 220 extending at a right angle to a radial plane 222 extending      from the pivotal axis 215 and at a first or lesser distance from the      pivotal axis 215. </PAR><PAR>  The swivel bracket holding lever or member 211 also includes a high-tilt      bearing surface 223 which is located in angularly spaced relation to the      low-tilt surface 219 and which, when the swivel bracket holding lever or      member 211 is in the park position, is located generally above the pivotal      axis 215, and in a plane 224 extending at a right angle to a radial plane      225 extending from the pivotal axis 215 and at a second or greater      distance from the pivotal axis 215 than the first distance. The adjacent      ends of the low and high-tilt bearing surfaces 219 and 223 are connected      by a non-bearing surface 227 extending, when the swivel bracket holding      lever or member 211 is located in the park position, generally above the      pivotal axis 215. Extending from the other end of the low-tilt bearing      surface 219 remote from the non-bearing surface 227 is a finger pad 229      adapted for engagement by the finger of an operator for rotating the      swivel bracket holding lever or member 211 in the counter-clockwise      direction as shown in FIG. 5. Extending from the other end of the      high-tilt bearing surface 223 remote from the non-bearing surface 227 is      another finger pad 231 adapted for engagement by the finger of an operator      for rotating the swivel bracket holding lever or member 211 in the      clockwise direction as shown in FIG. 5. </PAR><PAR>  Also provided are detent means for releasably retaining the swivel bracket      holding lever or member 211 in a selected one of the park, low-tilt, and      high-tilt positions. While other constructions can be employed, the      disclosed construction comprises (see FIG. 6) a cam track or surface 241      on one of the swivel bracket 17 and the swivel bracket holding lever or      member 211, and (see FIGS. 8 and 9) a detent ball 243 carried by the other      of the swivel bracket 17 and the swivel bracket holding lever or member      211. In the specifically disclosed construction, the cam track 241 extends      arcuately around the mounting aperature 214 or pivotal axis 215 on the      hidden side of the swivel bracket holding lever or member 211, i.e., on      the side adjacent the swivel bracket 17, and the detent ball 243 is      carried by the swivel bracket 17. </PAR><PAR>  Means are also provided for biasing the detent ball 243 toward the cam      track or surface 241. While other constructions can be employed, in the      disclosed construction, the swivel bracket 17 includes (see FIG. 9) a bore      245 which is located in spaced relation to the pivot axis 215, and which      receives a detent ball retainer or carrier 247 which supports the detent      ball 243 and which includes an inwardly open bore 249 with an internal      shoulder 251. Located within the bore 249 is a coil spring 253 which, at      one end, bears against the swivel bracket 17 and which, at the other end,      bears against the internal shoulder 251, thereby biasing the detent ball      carrier 247 out of the bore 245 in the swivel bracket 17 so as to      pressingly engage the detent ball 243 against the cam track 241. </PAR><PAR>  Still more particularly, as shown best in FIGS. 6 and 10, the cam track 241      includes three angularly spaced recesses, i.e., a park recess 261, a      low-tilt recess 263, and a high-tilt recess 265, which recesses 261, 263,      and 265 are adapted to releasably receive the detent ball 243 when the      swivel bracket holding lever or member 211 is in the associated position.      Located between the recesses 261, 263, and 265 are two cam track peaks 267      and 269 which serve to selectively bias the swivel bracket holding lever      toward a selected one of the three positions depending upon the location      of the swivel bracket holding lever or member 211. </PAR><PAR>  Means are also provided for limiting rotation of the swivel bracket holding      lever or member 211 relative to the swivel bracket 17. While other      arrangements can be employed, in the disclosed construction, one of the      swivel bracket holding lever or member 211 and the swivel bracket 17      includes (see FIGS. 6 and 7) a stud 271 extending into (see FIG. 8) a void      or recess 273 in the other of the swivel bracket holding lever or member      211 and the swivel bracket 17. Still more particularly, in the      specifically disclosed construction, the swivel bracket holding lever or      member 211 includes the stud 271 which extends from the hidden side, which      is located in spaced relation to the cam track 241, and which extends into      the void or recess 273 in the swivel bracket 17 defined, in part, by      spaced walls 275 and 277 which, incident to swivel bracket holding lever      rotation, are engaged by the stud 271 to limit such rotation so as to      prevent movement of the swivel bracket holding lever or member 211 beyond      the range providing the three positions. </PAR><PAR>  Because the axis 215 of the swivel bracket holding lever or member rotation      is spaced downwardly from the top of the swivel bracket 17, the major      portion of the swivel bracket holding lever or member 211 is hidden from      view in (see FIG. 11) a recess 281 in the adjacent starboard transom      bracket element 22 when the propulsion unit 51 is in a running position      and the swivel bracket holding lever or member 211 is in the park      position. However, when the propulsion unit 51 is raised or tilted      upwardly, as for instance by the tilt cylinder/piston assembly 83, the      swivel bracket holding lever or member 211 becomes accessible by the      operator and is selectively engagable with the top surface portion 217 of      the starboard transom bracket element 22, just forwardly of the recess      281. More particuarly, the operator can engage the finger pads 229 and 231      of the swivel bracket holding lever or member 211 to rotate the swivel      bracket holding lever or member 211 in the appropriate direction as may be      desired. Of course, during such rotation, the propulsion unit 51 is      raised, as for instance by the tilt cylinder/piston assembly 83, so as to      disengage the appropriate one of the bearing surfaces 219 and 223 from the      starboard transom bracket element 22 and to elevate the swivel bracket 17      sufficiently above the upper surface portion 217 of the starboard transom      bracket element 22 to facilitate such movement as desired. </PAR><PAR>  The outboard motor 11 also includes, as part of three position retaining      means, means for holding the propulsion unit 51 in the before mentioned      trail position within the tilt range, but below the two tilt positions,      i.e., below the low-tilt and high-tilt positions. In the disclosed      construction, the holding means positively prevents &quot;bouncing&quot; of the      propulsion unit 51 relative to the transom bracket 13. </PAR><PAR>  More particularly, while other constructions can be employed, in the      disclosed construction, such holding means includes (see FIGS. 2 and 5)      pivotal mounting on the swivel bracket 17 of the before mentioned trail      arm 201 which is moveable between a retracted position and an extended      trail position in which an outer end or foot of the trail arm 201 is      engaged in a socket, notch or recess in the transom bracket 13 so as to      locate the propulsion unit 51 in a desired trail angle relative to the      transom bracket 13. Such holding means also includes latch means for      releasably retaining the outer end or foot of the trail arm 201 in the      recess, and thereby preventing &quot;bouncing.&quot; </PAR><PAR>  Still more particularly, while other constructions can be employed, the      trail arm 201 (see FIG. 2) is preferably integrally formed to include two      laterally spaced and parallel arm portions 305 and 307 which respectively      include edge surfaces 306 and 308 and which are integrally connected      centrally thereof by a cross portion 309 including a arcuately curved      central part 311 permitting close adjacent relation of the trail arm 201      to the forward surface 31 of the central portion 29 of the swivel bracket      17 when the trail arm 201 is in the retracted position. </PAR><PAR>  Still more particularly, the arm portions 305 and 307 respectively include      aligned lower or rearward ends 315 and 317 which are respectively      pivotally mounted by suitable respective bolts 319 (one shown in FIG. 5)      to the laterally spaced lower portions 52 and 54 of the lower end 50 of      the swivel bracket 17. When in the retracted position, the trail arm 201      extends upwardly from the lower end of the swivel bracket 17 into close      association therewith. When in such retracted position, the edge surfaces      306 and 308 face rearwardly and substantially occupy (as shown in FIG. 21)      the space between the lower end 50 of the swivel brackt 17 and the lower      part, below the recesses 34 and 36, of the laterally inner edges 28 and 30      of the transom bracket elements or portions 21 and 22. The arm portions      305 and 307 also respectively include outer ends 325 and 327 which, when      the trial arm 201 is in the extended trail position, are received and      releasably held in cooperating sockets, recesses or notches 335 and 337      respectively formed in the spaced transom bracket elements 21 and 22. In      addition, the arm portion 309 includes a finger tab 341 facilitating      movement of the trail arm 201 by an operator from the retracted position      to the extended trail position. </PAR><PAR>  Means are provided for biasing the trail arm 201 to the retracted position.      While other constructions can be employed, in the disclosed construction,      such biasing means comprises (see FIG. 5) a coil spring 245 having a first      end 247 bearing against the trail arm 201 and a second end 249 which is      suitably anchored to the swivel bracket 17. </PAR><PAR>  While other constructions can be employed, in the disclosed construction,      the means for releasably holding or retaining the trail arm 201 in      supported engagement with the transom bracket 13 comprises, on the trail      arm 201, a projection or lug 243 extending laterally from the outer end      327 of the arm portion 307, and (see FIGS. 14 through 19) a latch member      or keeper 251 which is pivotally mounted on the starboard transom bracket      element 22 adjacent the socket or notch 337 for movement relative to a      retaining position. The latch member 251 includes an outer hook portion      253 which is defined by a blocking or retaining surface 255 and by a      camming surface 257. When in the retaining position, the retaining surface      255 extends into blocking or interfering relation to the path of      withdrawal of the laterally extending projection or lug 243, and thereby      positively retains the trail arm 201 from removal from the socket or notch      337. </PAR><PAR>  Means are provided for biasing the latch member or keeper 251 in the      counter-clockwise direction (as shown in FIGS. 16 through 19) and into the      retaining position. While other constructions can be employed, in the      disclosed construction, such means comprises a helical coil spring 261      having one end 262 engaged with the latch member 251 and having another      end 264 bearing against the transom bracket 13. </PAR><PAR>  Still more particularly (and as shown in FIG. 15), the latch member 251 is      fixed to a latch shaft 263 which extends through a suitable horizontal      aperture or bore 265 in the starboard transom bracket element 22 and      which, at the outer end thereof, has fixed thereon a handle 268      facilitating movement of the latch member 251 from the retracted position.      Preferably, the starboard transom bracket element 22 includes (see FIGS.      1, 5, and 14) a recess 270 which, when the latch member 251 is in the      retracted position, substantially encloses or houses the latch lever      handle 268. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, the latch member 251 is generally located, when in the retaining      position, in the path of movement of the projection or lug 243 on the      trail arm 201. When the trail arm 201 is in the extended trail position      and located for entry into the supporting notch, socket, or recess 337,      engagement of the projection or lug 243 with the camming surface 257      serves to pivotally displace the latch member 251 from the retaining      position in the counter-clockwise direction, as seen in FIG. 16, and out      of the path of the projection or lug 243 during insertion of the outer end      or foot 327 of the trail arm 201 into the socket, recess, or notch 337.      Upon full insertion of the outer end or foot 327 into the socket, recess,      or notch 337, the latch member 251 rotates in the clockwise direction, as      shown in FIG. 17, to the retaining position in interfering engagement with      the path of travel of the projection or lug 243 incident to withdrawal of      the outer end or foot 327 from the supporting socket, recess, or notch      337, thereby positively retaining the trail arm 201 in the notch 337. </PAR><PAR>  Means are also provided for releasably retaining the latch member 251 in a      retracted position spaced from the retaining position and against the      action of the biasing spring 261, and for releasing the latch member 251      from the spaced position incident to withdrawal of trail arm 201 from the      socket, recess, or notch 337, thereby permitting action of the spring 261      to return the latch member 251 to its normal retaining position. </PAR><PAR>  While other constructions can be employed, in the disclosed construction,      such means comprises (See FIGS. 16 through 19) a detent lever 301 which is      mounted on the starboard transom bracket element 22 for pivotal movement      about a fixed pin 303 between a first position extending slightly into the      path of movement of the outer end or foot 327 of the trail arm 211 and a      second position spaced from the first or extending position and out of the      socket, recess, or notch 337. Pivotal movement of the detent lever 301      between its two positions is limited to a relatively small arc by reason      of a short slot 302 provided in the detent lever 301 and a fixed pin 304      which extends through the slot 302 and into the starboard transom bracket      element 22. </PAR><PAR>  The means for releasably retaining the latch member 251 in the retracted      position also includes means on the detent member 301 and on the latch      member 251 for holding the latch member 251 in the retracted position when      the detent lever 301 is in a position at least partially extending into      the socket or notch 337 and into engagement with the outer end or foot 327      when the outer end or foot 327 of the trail arm 201 in the socket, recess,      or notch 337. While other constructions can be employed, in the disclosed      construction, such means comprises formation of the detent member 301,      adjacent the lower end thereof, with a thin outwardly projecting finger or      tang 311 which integrally extends resiliently and flexibly from the detent      member 301. In addition, such means also includes, on the latch member      251, a stop surface 313 extending radially outwardly with respect to the      axis of pivotal latch member movement, and a camming surface 315 leading      to the outer end of the stop surface 313. More particularly, the camming      surface 315 is formed (See FIG. 15) on a bushing 316 which encircles the      latch member shaft 263 and is fixed against movement relative to the latch      member 251. </PAR><PAR>  When the trail arm 201 is located with the outer end or foot 327 thereof in      the socket, recess, or notch 337, and when the detent member 301 is in the      position extending at least partially into the recess 337 and in      engagement with the trail arm 201, and an operator desires to unlatch the      trail arm 201 from the starboard transom bracket element 22, the latch      member handle 268 is actuated to rotate the latch member 251 in the      counter-clockwise direction, as seen in FIG. 18, for about 135.degree.      from the retaining position. Such action initially causes engagement of      the outer end of the finger 311 with the camming surface 315, causing the      finger 311 to flex or bend from the normal outwardly extending position      and relative to the main body of the detent member 301, and to ride up the      camming surface 315 toward the outer end of the stop surface 313.      Continued movement of the latch member 251 in the counter-clockwise      direction, as shown in FIGS. 18 and 19, causes the finger 311 to ride off      the camming surface 315 and to travel past the stop surface 313 and to      return to the normal outwardly extending position. When the latch member      handle 267 is released, the spring 261 causes latch member clockwise      movement, as shown in FIG. 19, until the stop surface 313 is engaged by      the finger 311. Such engagement prevents further movement of the latch      member 251 toward the retaining position, retains the latch member 251 in      substantially spaced position from the retaining position, and displaces      the detent member 301 into relatively tight engagement with the projection      or lug 243. The components will retain these positions as long as the      outer end or foot 327 of the trail arm 201 is located in the socket,      recess, or notch 337. </PAR><PAR>  However, when and if the tilt cylinder/piston assembly 83 is actuated to      raise the propulsion unit 51 above the trail position, such action,      because the latch member 251 is not in the retaining position, will cause      withdrawal of the outer end or foot 327 of the trail arm 201 from the      socket, recess, or notch 337. Such withdrawal releases the engagement of      the projection or lug 243 with the detent member 301 and permits movement      of the detent member 301 into the extending position in the socket,      recess, or notch 337. Such movement of the detent member 301 withdraws the      engagement of the finger 311 with the stop surface 313, whereupon the      spring 261 causes the latch member 251 to pivot in the counter-clockwise      direction, as shown in FIGS. 17 through 19, into the retaining position      shown in FIG. 17. The components are now again ready to accept the trail      arm 201 when it is next desired to retain the propulsion unit 51 in the      trail position. The latch member handle 268 is also again located in the      recess 270 on the exterior surface of the starboard transom bracket      element 22. </PAR><PAR>  Means are provided for limiting movement of the latch member 251 in the      clockwise direction as shown in FIGS. 16 through 19 to the retaining      position shown in FIG. 17 under the influence of the spring 261. While      other constructions can be employed, in the disclosed construction such      means comprises a stud 321 on the upper end of the detent member 301 and      an ear or shoulder 323 located on the latch member or keeper 251 at the      outer end of the camming surface 257. </PAR><PAR>  Various of the features of the invention are set forth in the following      claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  We claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
