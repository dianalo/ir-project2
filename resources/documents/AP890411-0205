Takeshita's statement was a reversal of earlier comments that hehad not received money from Recruit Co., an information andpublishing conglomerate.   ``I am feeling my political and moral responsibilities verystrongly,'' he told parliament's budget committee. ``I think it isimportant to settle this matter legally and politically as soon aspossible.''   A series of recent news reports linking Takeshita to Recruit hadprompted the prime minister to explain his role in the wideningscandal.   ``I am aware the Recruit scandal is the most serious matter Ihave ever experienced in the 38 years of my political career,'' hesaid during the nationally televised committee hearing.   ``Political reform is essential to overcome the currentsituation and restore public trust in politics.''   Takeshita said Recruit and its subsidiaries gave about $1million between 1985 and 1987 to his political organizations in theform of donations and purchases of fund-raising party tickets whilehe was finance minister and secretary-general of the governingLiberal Democratic Party.   The prime minister said the money was treated as politicaldonations, not bribes.   Asked by opposition lawmaker Kanji Kawasaki of the JapanSocialist Party what his understanding was of Recruit's intentionin making such large donations, Takeshita replied: ``I am not in aposition of telling the intent of another party's politicaldonations.''   In the scandal, Recruit sold hundreds of thousands of unlistedshares in a real-estate subsidiary to about 160 political, businessand government officials at low prices.   Buyers of the shares received handsome profits when the stockvalue soared shortly after being listed on the over-the-countermarket.   Takeshita has acknowledged that a former aide and relativebought shares for a profit of about $190,000. But he deniedpersonal involvement in the transactions.   To opposition charges that he had reversed his earlierstatements, Takeshita said: ``I do not remember the details of mystatement, but I probably did not have clear recollections of thematter then.''   In October, Takeshita told Japan's Diet, or parliament: ``I havenever received funds or whatsoever from Recruit.''   The scandal has prompted the opposition to demand that Takeshitaresign and call elections to allow the public to give its verdicton the scandal. Some members of his party also want him to stepdown.   ``Your resignation is the only way to save Japan's democracy,''said Kawasaki. ``You are not entitled to discuss political reforms.Your hand is contaminated with Recruit money.''   Japanese politicians long have relied on substantial donationsfrom corporations, both for campaign expenses and for the kind ofgift-giving that has become a custom. Politicians say, for example,they are expected to send gifts for constituents' weddings,funerals and other occasions.   Because of widespread gift-giving, links between gifts andfavors generally are not clear. But the media long have criticizedthe close links between business and government.   Proposed reforms would require a clearer public accounting ofdonations.   Three people resigned from Takeshita's Cabinet afteracknowledging they continued to receive Recruit donations after thescandal broke last summer. Takeshita said he did not receiveRecruit money after 1987, the year he became prime minister.   He declined to answer opposition questions about how he wouldtake responsibility if more allegations linking him to the Recruitwere revealed.   ``But at this point, I do not anticipate anything of that sortwill come out,'' he said.   So far, 14 people, including two former vice ministers, havebeen arrested on bribery and securities law violation charges inthe Recruit scandal.   The investigation is continuing and several politicians arebeing questioned by authorities.   Opposition parties said they suspect Takeshita's donations fromRecruit may violate the law governing political donations.Companies of Recruit's size are only allowed to donate $113,636annually to a politician.   Also, if it was substantiated that Takeshita, as the financeminister, provided the firm with favors in return for donations, hewill become subject to bribery laws.   Public support for Takeshita in opinion polls has declined toall-time lows. One poll released Monday showed Takeshita's approvalrate at just 7.8 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
