Seib and Joe Davidson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson plans a series of battles to push some of his controversial ideas into the Democratic platform, but he describes his intentions in conciliatory tones and forecasts a peaceful party convention in Atlanta next month.    &quot;There will be a struggle over priorities,&quot; Mr. Jackson said. &quot;There will be a struggle over commitment. You can't have a platform that says little and does less.&quot; Yet, &quot;I don't at this point see the kind of bloodletting that we saw in Chicago (in 1968) outside the convention, the kind of struggles inside the convention,&quot; the Rev. Jackson said yesterday in a meeting with The Wall Street Journal's Washington bureau.    Mr. Jackson reiterated that he deserves to be considered as a running mate for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the expected Democratic nominee. But when asked whether he actually would accept the position, he said those thoughts are &quot;private.&quot; He dismissed suggestions that the post of vice president is meaningless, saying he thinks the job should be redefined to include responsibility for U.S. relations with the Third World, and insisted he is qualified to handle such a task.    &quot;As I see it, we need someone to focus on the area of the world where we're weak who has credibility there -- the Third World,&quot; Mr. Jackson said. &quot;Gorbachev couldn't beat me in Angola or Mozambique or Latin America, for example.&quot;    Mr. Jackson's forceful description of his qualifications to handle Third World diplomacy, in fact, suggested he might be interested in a job encompassing such tasks even if, as seems almost certain, he doesn't become vice president.    Mr. Jackson, perhaps as much as anyone, has the power to set the tone for the Democrats' convention, and he made it clear that he intends to push for what he calls &quot;progressive&quot; platform planks in five areas that are likely to produce face-offs with Dukakis forces. But he also implied he is ready for compromises and tradeoffs, particularly on the emotional issue of a Palestinian state.    He said he intends to push the party to endorse raising the top personal-income-tax rate, perhaps to 38% from the current 28%, to attack the federal deficit accumulated during the Reagan years. &quot;We don't know what the final language will be, but you come out of the hole the way you went in it,&quot; he said. That position is unacceptable to Mr. Dukakis, who doesn't rule out tax increases but doesn't want to call for any during the campaign.    Mr. Jackson also signaled that he intends to push a platform plank calling for a freeze in defense budgets, which would produce a decline in defense spending after adjustment for inflation. He used the burgeoning Pentagon procurement scandal to buttress his argument for a freeze.    &quot;We'd just freeze the margin of corruption,&quot; he said. &quot;I might amend (the freeze idea) just to include corruption. The Pentagon has so much money it can't spend it all. It doesn't know how to spend it.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis has opposed a defense freeze, and implies he favors allowing the Pentagon budget to keep pace with inflation. Fearful of Republican charges that he's soft on defense, he's highly unlikely to accept a freeze plank.    Mr. Jackson also indicated he will push for far more generous commitments to domestic spending programs than Mr. Dukakis has made so far. In particular, he said, his camp has specific spending proposals for a national-health-care plan, prenatal-health care, the Head Start preschool program and education as well as for the use of public pension funds for housing and small-business loans. There may be room for compromise between Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Jackson in these areas.    On foreign-policy issues, Mr. Jackson said he will continue to push for a platform plank declaring the U.S. won't be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict. &quot;My position is simply that first use begets first retaliation,&quot; he said. &quot;The position must be simply no first use.&quot; Mr. Dukakis outright opposes any ban on first use.    But on another foreign-policy issue, his supporters' effort to write a platform plank calling for a Palestinian state, Mr. Jackson implied he may be prepared to compromise with Dukakis forces who don't want to endorse a state. The most important issue, Mr. Jackson said, is to endorse a peace plan with a set of &quot;principles&quot; including Palestinian &quot;self-determination, recognizing sovereignty of a homeland for Palestinian people.&quot;    Asked whether his use of the term &quot;homeland&quot; rather than &quot;state&quot; suggested a way to compromise on the issue, Mr. Jackson answered: &quot;Possible compromise. It's finally for the people there to determine.&quot; In the end, he said, the debate on the Palestinian issue should &quot;move us closer to what ought to be done.&quot;    But while discussing such potentially divisive issues, Mr. Jackson stressed his belief that they will be resolved without messy public fights between his camp and Mr. Dukakis's at the convention. Indeed, he said all disputes between the two campaigns over which delegates will receive convention credentials apparently are being resolved.    Similarly, he said he and Mr. Dukakis think there should be changes in the rules governing the conduct of Democratic party primaries and selection of party leaders. &quot;But we will have basically worked them out before&quot; the convention, he added.    He played down the chances that platform debates could spill over into disruptive floor fights and indicated a willingness to work with the party establishment.    &quot;Sometimes big floor fights, which is a historic reference, means the kind of division that could just make people pick up their marbles and go home,&quot; Mr. Jackson said. &quot;I think there's a different concept now. . . . I believe we must have one step in the status quo, that is reality, one in the future. That is my constituency -- the newest Democrats, the youngest Democrats.&quot;    Mr. Jackson didn't have any harsh words for Mr. Dukakis. But he chided him for being &quot;fiscally conservative,&quot; and particularly said he hasn't been willing to promise enough money to improve American education or revitalize American industries. Thus, he said, Mr. Dukakis needs to balance his ticket by picking a &quot;progressive&quot; rather than by picking a more conservative Democrat, as is more commonly argued.    Mr. Jackson said a recent meeting he held with Mr. Dukakis's campaign chairman, Paul Brountas, to discuss the vice presidental nomination was &quot;businesslike.&quot; (When it was suggested that such a description implied a cold session, Mr. Jackson quipped that it was an appropriate description to use in a discussion with a business publication like The Wall Street Journal.) Mr. Jackson and half a dozen other Democrats being considered as running mates have been asked by the Dukakis campaign to submit financial records for review.    In a description that would easily fit himself, Mr. Jackson said the nominee for vice president should have &quot;a solid record of commitment to social justice, to economic justice, to workers' rights to women's rights.&quot;    Almost no one close to Mr. Dukakis believes the Democratic nominee will select Mr. Jackson as his running mate. Thus the significance of Mr. Jackson's comments on this may be whether he's trying to establish grounds for declaring unacceptable to his followers more conservative possiblities such as Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia. </TEXT></DOC>
