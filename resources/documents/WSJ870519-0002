The continuing strength of system prices is a dominant topic among executives attending the National Cable Television Association convention, which ends here tomorrow.    &quot;Prices will go higher before they plateau,&quot; predicts Paul Kagan, a Carmel, Calif.-based media consultant.    But it isn't just large public companies such as Denver-based Tele-Communications that are in the market now. In addition, &quot;it's the small and medium-sized companies who are propping up prices,&quot; says John Waller III, a leading cable-system broker.    Although the big companies are still interested in properties, they seem reluctant to pay top dollar. Trygve Mhyren, chief executive officer of Time Inc.'s 80%-owned American Television andamp; Communications Inc., says, &quot;We wouldn't pay $2,000 (per subscriber) for everything, but we're willing to do it for things that make sense,&quot; for example, systems that are geographically contiguous to existing American Television markets. Mr. Mhyren says that since last August his company has bought cable systems serving 80,000 subscribers at prices ranging between $1,200 and $2,000 per subscriber.    Sellers are making handsome profits, even in marginally attractive markets. For example, former Capital Cities/ABC Inc. executive William James last week sold to First Carolina Communications Inc. for $170 million cable systems that he purchased last year for $100 million. The sale price is the equivalent of about $1,700 per subscriber. Executives of Burlington, Vt.based Mountain Cable are said to be negotiating the sale of their 58,000-subscriber system -- acquired for $42 million 2 1/2 years ago -- for about $115 million.    A number of major cable-television companies say prices are too high now. William Elsner, chief financial officer of Denver-based United Cable Television Inc. told analysts here that current high prices &quot;took us out of the acquisition business.&quot; He said that unless a cable system is in a key geographic area near other United systems, &quot;we aren't going to stretch that far to get it.&quot;    Mr. Elsner said it is &quot;tough to make a return&quot; on a $2,000-per-subscriber investment. Cable systems are generally sold on the basis of their cash flow -- 12 to 13 times cash flow is the going rate -- but industry executives often use per-subscriber figures as well.    Deregulation has permitted cable systems to increase their cash flow by raising prices to consumers. Cash flow also has benefited because most of the hefty capital expenditures for laying systems have been completed.    John Kornreich, an analyst at Neuberger andamp; Berman, acknowledges that current prices are hard to justify, but he notes that cable systems' cash flow is growing 20% annually because of rate increases. &quot;If the price isn't right for this year, it is for next year,&quot; he says. &quot;A lot of small players are saying we have a window of opportunity now, we better get in.&quot;    Mr. Kornreich notes that buyers are willing to pay high prices even for older systems in economically unexciting areas. For example, Adams Russell Inc. recently outbid about 25 rivals to buy R.R. Donnelley andamp; Sons Co.'s Rockford, Ill., cable system for about $90 million, or about $1,800 per subscriber. Adams Russell also agreed to rebuild the system at a cost of about $200 per subscriber.    &quot;While local economics are important, cable thrives almost anywhere,&quot; says Mr. Kornreich.    John Reidy, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., says an increase in interest rates could damp cable's attractiveness compared with other investments. But, according to Mr. Kornreich, &quot;It would take a big run-up in interest rates&quot; to significantly reduce the appeal of cable systems. </TEXT></DOC>
