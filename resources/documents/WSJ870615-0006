Consider last Tuesday's annual meeting of Stewart andamp; Stevenson Services Inc. of Houston. The company used the meeting to report some vital corporate developments: the purchase of a tractor dealership in Casper, Wyo., for instance, and the opening of a sales outlet in New Mexico.    But the heavy-equipment distributor left one item off the agenda: a $1.1 million first-quarter loss that was publicly announced about an hour before the meeting began -- in other words, as shareholders were traveling to the meeting. The loss sent the company's stock price reeling, falling on Tuesday to $18 bid from $19.75 in over-the-counter trading.    Shareholders attending the meeting were unaware, of course, that while the company was waxing positive about its increased order backlog, shareholders not in attendance were unloading the stock.    &quot;My stock went down $2,500 while I was watching the annual meeting,&quot; says James Tucker of Houston, who owned 2,000 shares. Unaware of the loss, Mr. Tucker intended to visit his broker on the way home to pick up another 2,000 shares. A heavy rainstorm prompted him to postpone the stock purchase.    A Stewart andamp; Stevenson spokesman explains that despite the adverse stock-market reaction, the loss was typical of the first quarter because of seasonal factors. &quot;There was nothing surprising in the numbers themselves,&quot; he says.    In any case, the loss wasn't worth taking up the time to announce at the meeting, the spokesman says. &quot;We had a new film strip&quot; to show, he explains.    Reed Carefully   So, what's the big deal about a couple of typographical errors in a new product announcement? Plenty if the new product is a spelling checker.    &quot;This is the worst travesty you could ever commit,&quot; says Michael Weiner, president of Microlytics Inc., an East Rochester, N.Y., computer-products company.    The travesty occurred in a recent announcement of an agreement to supply spell-checking technology for the XyWrite III Plus word processor. Mr. Weiner was at a computer show in Atlanta and didn't proofread the announcement, which included the non-words &quot;tradmark&quot; and &quot;publishere.&quot;    Mel Webster, vice president of Miller Communications, the Boston public-relations firm that made the mistakes says, &quot;I thought of telling him the errors were on page three and it wasn't likely anybody read that far. But you don't like to say that to a client.&quot; Instead, Miller sent out a &quot;we goofed&quot; letter. It also decided to buy a Microlytics spell-checking product.    Don't Forget Us   William Agee and Mary Cunningham used to go out of their way to avoid publicity about their personal lives.    But the couple (of Bendix Corp. fame) recently instructed St. Margaret's Hospital for Women in Boston to issue a news release announcing that they &quot;are expecting their second child. The anticipated due date is Father's Day, Sunday, June 21.&quot;    Acknowledging that it &quot;is not standard&quot; for St. Margaret's to announce impending births, a spokeswoman says that the couple wanted the hospital to handle publicity so Ms. Cunningham wouldn't be inundated with calls to her room, as she was when their first child was born.    Not to worry. Due date notwithstanding, Ms. Cunningham gave birth last Wednesday -- and the hospital received only two calls regarding the Agees as of Friday.    If you are interested and couldn't get through to Ms. Cunningham, it's a boy.    ODDS AND ENDS   Woodstream Corp. of Lititz, Pa., which sells a mousetrap that captures mice alive, has had to change the product's packaging. A test group of consumers who tried the product objected to its written instructions for &quot;disposing of&quot; the trapped mouse. The mouse sounded dead. Now the packaging refers to &quot;releasing&quot; the mouse. . . Who's on First? A recent letter from the media-relations department of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. began: &quot;A few short yesterdays ago, the Integrated Services Digital Network meant tomorrow, and a center to demonstrate ISDN's powerhouse potential in public networking was only an idea. Now, both are real. Both are here, in our own backyard. Now I invite you to take a walk into the future, and let me show you tomorrow today. . ..&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
