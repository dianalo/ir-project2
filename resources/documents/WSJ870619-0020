But the rate of gain will prove disappointingly small.    That is the prevailing view among economists who try to keep a close tab on what's ahead for business. Most forecasters keep scaling down the anticipated pace of advance. Only recently, most expected near-brisk growth in the months just ahead; now snail-like progress seems more likely. But whatever develops, a recession seems only a distant threat -- and one that may in fact be lessening because the expansion looks to be so sluggish.    &quot;The economy simply isn't showing the bounce that I'd expected only a few months ago,&quot; declares Albert H. Cox Jr., an economist at Bil Management Inc., a New York investment firm. &quot;The silver lining is that this should tend to keep general business activity from overheating -- severe inflation, shortages, squeezed credit and so on -- which is the usual prelude to a recession.&quot;    Early this year, Mr. Cox expected the economy to grow about 3.5% in 1987; now he sees barely 2%.    Mr. Cox isn't alone in lowering his sights. A similar scaling down is evident, for instance, in Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter that each month polls 51 leading forecasters. As recently as April, the Blue Chip forecasters estimated, on the average, that the economy would expand at progressively higher annual rates as 1987 went along -- 2.6% in the current quarter, 3.3% in the third quarter and 3.5% in the fourth, followed by a even brisker 3.6% gain in the first three months of 1988.    Now, the group's average forecast still calls for larger and larger quarterly gains, but of appreciably smaller magnitude -- only 1.5% in the current quarter, 2.7% in the third, 2.9% in the fourth and 3% in the first quarter of 1988.    For all of 1988, the Blue Chip forecasters expect growth of 2.9%, down from a 3.3% gain anticipated only three months ago. The Blue Chip newsletter regards increases below 3% as sufficiently slim to necessitate yellow coloring -- for caution -- for its front page. Higher rates of growth warrant a green front page -- for a smooth, strong growth ahead -- and negative rates, which occur when the economy is in a recession, bring forth a red front page.    If such scaled-down forecasts prove remotely near the mark, the pace of the current expansion will sag sharply from the level of recent months. In the year's first quarter, according to a Commerce Department report issued Wednesday, the economy grew at an annual rate of 4.8%, the sharpest quarterly gain since early 1984.    Most analysts contend, however, that there is less to the first-quarter showing than meets the eye, since much of the gain reflects an unexpectedly high rate of inventory-building, rather than sales to final customers, which fell in the quarter. Many forecasters regard this inventory buildup as a serious drag on economic activity in coming months.    The Blue Chip consensus, for example, estimates that the recent inventory surge -- caused in no small measure by unsold cars -- will trim some 2.5 percentage points from the second-quarter increase in inflation-adjusted gross national product, which economists usually equate with overall business activity. The prevailing view is that potential demand is simply insufficient to support present inventory levels and that production schedules in many businesses will have to be restrained until supplies are worked down.    Aggravating the situation is lackluster retail-sales activity. Last month, retail sales fell slightly and consumers made large cutbacks in outlays for automobiles and home furnishings. These, of course, are categories where a major expense is normally involved and a purchase is readily postponed when would-be customers feel strapped.    And that's just how many consumers do feel, declares Lacy H. Hunt, economist at CMandamp;M Group Inc., a New York securities firm. &quot;Costs of many consumer necessities continue to rise,&quot; he says, &quot;but income hasn't been keeping pace.&quot; By no coincidence, he adds, savings have eroded -- from 6.3% of after-tax income in 1984 to 5.1% in 1985 to 3.8% last year. The slide has continued this year, with the saving rate dropping as low as 0.1% in April, a post-1930s nadir.    &quot;Consumers, who account for roughly two-thirds of all business activity, have been drained of discretionary spending money that could have been devoted to cars and other major items,&quot; Mr. Hunt remarks. Demand for one exceedingly major item -- housing -- is clearly softening, he adds, pointing to recent monthly declines in both new-home starts and new-home permits, which tend to foreshadow starts.    At the same time, many consumers appear increasingly debt-burdened. Under the new tax law, interest payments on installment loans for autos and other consumer purchases are no longer fully deductible, which would seem likely to deter borrowing. Yet &quot;debt continues to grow much faster than income,&quot; says Edward S. Hyman Jr., economist of the New York investment firm of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc.    This, Mr. Hyman explains, is largely because many homeowners have sharply increased their borrowing on their homes, where interest charges may still be deducted. Added together, consumer-installment loans and all borrowing on homes now stand at about 150% of wage and salary income, Mr. Hyman says. That is some 20 percentage points higher than only two years ago, when interest on installment loans still could be fully deducted. He calls the current consumer-debt level &quot;dangerous&quot; and worries that it will make the next recession, whenever it arrives, &quot;severe.&quot;    The squeezed circumstances of many consumers would weigh even more on the economy, most analysts say, but for a continued narrowing in the nation's enormous foreign-trade deficit. They cite the dollar's sharp decline against most other major currencies, which tends, of course, to make U.S. goods and services more attractive abroad, as well as to Americans who may find foreign items no longer a bargain.    The upshot, says Mr. Hyman, will be a slight but progressive &quot;firming&quot; of overall growth -- as the Blue Chip consensus indicates -- even though the economy's huge consumer sector will probably remain &quot;sluggish.&quot; Many analysts mention an improving trade picture as a factor in last month's relatively robust 0.5% gain in industrial production.    Still, some forecasters regard any improvement in the foreign-trade balance as very much a mixed blessing. Robert J. Barbera, economist of E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. in New York, cautions that rising prices of foreign goods and services, as a result of the fallen dollar, &quot;appear to be translating into a price inflation of 5% at the consumer level.&quot; This comes, he adds, at a time of &quot;muted&quot; pay gains, which become pay cuts after price increases are taken into account. Citing such concerns, he forecasts economic growth of only about 1% annually in the year's second half.    A modest pickup in capital expenditures, some analysts say, may also help to offset a sluggish consumer sector. A recent government survey shows a 1987 rise in such spending of nearly 3%, after adjusting for inflation. This compares with an actual decline of roughly the same percentage last year.    Many corporations, moreover, appear to be revising their expenditure plans upward. A capital-spending survey by McGraw-Hill Inc. in May shows a 3.3% rise in planned outlays this year, while a similar poll in March found that 1987 spending would rise only 2%.    Walter Arvin, an economist at the Conference Board, a nonprofit research group, predicts that &quot;the economy should see a gradual increase in capital spending&quot; as 1987 goes along, &quot;with a possible spurt in the final quarter.&quot; He bases his analysis on a scheduled reduction in corporate tax rates July 1, as well as foreign competitive &quot;pressure on U.S. firms to make their facilities more productive.&quot;    A Conference Board survey finds that the nation's 1,000 largest manufacturers increased their new appropriations for capital projects nearly 4% in the first quarter of this year, the third consecutive quarterly gain. The largest increases were in textiles and the food-and-beverage industry. Forecasters regard appropriations as a precursor of actual spending.    Some sectors of the economy that lately have been especially weak appear to many analysts to be less so now, and this, too, could offset any consumer slowdown.    Vincent J. Malanga, the president of LaSalle Economics Inc., an economics consulting firm in New York, says that &quot;the notion of a recovery in the farm economy seems to be well grounded, and it appears to be sustainable because at the same time that farmers are getting their financial house in order, agricultural prices are improving.&quot; Between January and early June, he reports, prices that farmers get rose 19.8% on corn, 15.8% on soybeans, 7.9% on wheat, 33.6% on cotton, 26.4% on cattle and 29.8% on hogs.    Similarly, in the troubled oil industry, &quot;the degree of psychological and financial improvement&quot; in the past six months &quot;should not be underestimated,&quot; says Jeffrey R. Freedman, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York. &quot;The major oil companies are financially sound, have dramatically increased their liquidity in the last two years and are prepared to move forward,&quot; he says. He regards 1987 as the year when &quot;the five-year cyclical decline in capital spending for explorations and development&quot; should bottom out.    Like Mr. Cox, most forecasters see no recession in the next year or so. The Commerce Department's widely followed index of leading economic indicators fell in April, the latest month available, but a drop of only a month or two isn't deemed sufficient to signal a recession soon.    Frederick T. Dixon, an economist at ICI Americas Inc., a U.S. unit of the British chemicals producer, says that with the anticipated low rate of economic growth, &quot;The sequence from inflation to tight money to recession is something to watch for down the road, but not in 1987.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
