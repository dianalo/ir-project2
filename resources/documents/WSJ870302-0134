YangStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board approved a rule that limits a thrift's non-banking investments based on its capital and assets.    The new rule, which takes effect April 16, allows better-capitalized savings and loan associations to invest more than the current rule allows. Because the industry as a whole isn't well-capitalized, however, the new rule would at first be more stringent for many thrifts.    The Bank Board also proposed expanding its definition of transactions to be covered by the rule to include not only equity investments but high-risk loans as well.    Bank Board member Lee Henkel didn't participate in the vote on the advice of his own attorney and the Bank Board's general counsel.    When the three-member board considered its investment rule in December, Mr. Henkel sparked a controversy by proposing a version that might have helped an institution with which he has had extensive business dealings. The proposal died for lack of a second.    On the latest vote, Mr. Henkel said he didn't believe an actual conflict of interest existed, but was abstaining &quot;to avoid even the slightest appearance of impropriety.&quot; Mr. Henkel and Lawrence White are serving on the board while awaiting Senate confirmation.    Under the new rule, thrifts that meet the Bank Board's minimum capital requirement and have tangible capital that is less than 6% of their liabilities would be allowed to invest the greater of 3% of their assets or 2.5 times their tangible capital without prior regulatory approval.    A rule that took effect Jan. 1 gradually increases the minimum capital requirement from its current level of 3% of liabilities to 6% under an open-ended formula based on a thrift's net worth, which is assets minus liabilities.    Tangible capital is an institution's equity capital less intangible assets and &quot;net worth certificates,&quot; which are accounting items used to keep troubled thrifts from becoming insolvent.    Thrifts that meet the capital requirement and have tangible capital that is equal to or greater than 6% of their liabilities may invest as much as three times their tangible capital without prior approval.    Thrifts that don't meet the capital requirement must seek Bank Board approval for any non-banking investment.    Currently, a thrift may place as much as 10% of its assets in non-banking investments without prior approval. The way the formula works out, any thrift whose tangible capital is less than 4% of liabilities will be under a tighter restriction under the new rule.    The average tangible capital level throughout the industry is 2% of liabilities, according to Bank Board officials. The institutions with higher tangible capital levels tend to be smaller and less likely to make the sorts of investments the rule addresses, while those with lower tangible capital levels are larger and more likely to participate in such transactions.    Bank Board member White praised the new approach as &quot;more rational&quot; than the current regulation, directing the supervision where it is needed most.    The Bank Board also proposed expanding the sorts of transactions that would be covered by this regulation. In addition to equity investments, it would include loans for the purchase of land and for the construction of nonresidential buildings where the size of the loan is greater than 80% of the value of the property.    Bank Board officials want to include these loans, which they call &quot;equity risk investments,&quot; in the rule's limits because the thrift or the agency wouldn't be likely to recover much of the money should the loan turn sour.    The proposal will be open to public comment for 30 days after it is published in the Federal Register. </TEXT></DOC>
