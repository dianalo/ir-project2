He vowed to continuepressing for a constitutional amendment.   During an appearance in the White House briefing room, thepresident said he was withholding his signature from thecongressional legislation ``to signal our belief that aconstitutional amendment is the best way to provide lastingprotection for the flag.''   Bush commented on the flag legislation in a brief openingstatement before responding to questions on other issues.   When Congress is in session, legislation can become lawautomatically if the president does not act on it within 10 workingdays of when it is sent to the White House. After Congress hasadjourned, a president can pocket-veto bills by refusing to signthem.   ``I believe the American flag is a unique and special symbol ofour nation and it should be protected from desecration, and ouradministration has proposed a constitutional amendment to protectthe flag,'' Bush said in his statement.   He proposed the amendment after the Supreme Court ruled lastJune that flag-burning was a constitutionally protected form offree speech.   The court ruling brought a flood of calls for an amendment tothe Constitution, but after the initial response many members ofCongress including the Democratic leadership began looking for away to deal with the problem through legislation rather thanchanging the Constitution.   When asked if he were concerned about the political consequencesof vetoing flag-burning legislation in the light of his attacks onDemocrat Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign, Bushdenied that was a consideration in his decision.   During the campaign, Bush and his supporters repeatedly attackedDukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, for vetoing legislationthat would have required public schools teachers in the state tolead pupils in daily recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance.   Bush said the congressional vote was ``an overwhelmingexpression on the part of the Congress to do something about theprotection of the flag. I don't think it's enough.''   ``I can understand the rationale of those who voted for thelegislation, but in my view, it is not the ultimate answer,'' hesaid.   The House voted 317-43 Thursday to complete congressional actionon the bill.   Supporting the bill were 154 Republicans and 217 Democrats,while it was opposed by 25 Democrats and 18 Republicans.   The measure requires up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine foranyone who ``knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles,burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flagof the United States.''   The lopsided approval margin reflected the power of the flag asa political symbol as demonstrated in last year's presidentialcampaign and by the outcry over the Supreme Court's June decisionoverturning a Texas flag-burning conviction.   The court reversed the conviction of Texas flag-burner GregoryLee Johnson on grounds the law violated his right to freedom ofspeech.   Bush contends a constitutional amendment would settle the issueonce and for all and could not be overturned by a court. Such ameasure is set to come before the Senate next week.   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., told reporters thatsomeone at the White House _ he did not recall the name _ told himthe president might stress his dislike of the bill while bowing toits popularity by letting it become law without his signature.   Soon afterward, White House sources said Bush was likely tofollow that course. He could do that by allowing the measure to situntouched after it reached his desk for 10 days while Congressremained in session. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.   Fitzwater, traveling with Bush in New York, declined to say whatthe president might do. ``We'll have to have a legal review takeplace'' when the bill arrives at the White House, he said.   Congressional Democrats, declaring that constitutionalamendments should be used only as a last resort, said their billwas so carefully worded that it probably could survive a courtchallenge.   ``It is the act of harming the physical integrity of the flagrather than any action that the message might convey that is to bepunished,'' said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks,D-Texas.   He said the idea was to make flag defacement illegal regardlessof whether it had anything to do with political protest and to makethe statute ``content neutral.''   Michel scoffed at that notion, however, saying there was no wayto draw up such a bill.   ``To those who believe we can overturn a Supreme Court decisionat this time by statute, I can only repeat the immortal words ofthe farmer who, asked directions, said, `You can't get there fromhere,''' Michel told the House.   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he hoped the Senatewould to block the proposed constitutional amendment next week.   ``I think the amendment would be extremely ill-advised,'' Foleysaid. ``I don't believe we should rush into any action that wouldamend the First Amendment without the greatest care and obviouslyit would be, I think, reckless to do so, I think, at this point.''</TEXT></DOC>
