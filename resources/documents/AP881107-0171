The quiet diplomacy usually is undertaken on a personal level:President P.W. Botha and 90 percent of his all-white Cabinet, plusmost of the white-dominated Parliament, are members of the DutchReformed Church.   Two years ago, the church, known by its Afrikaans initials as theNGK, adopted a document called ``Church and Society.'' It declaredapartheid a mistake, termed racism a sin and said the church couldno longer dictate specific political policies.   Fifty ministers and 30,000 people left the 953,000-member churchto form a new right-wing church. Within the main church, whichrepresents about 38 percent of the 5 million-white population, aconservative league was formed to try to repeal ``Church andSociety.''   The document said the church had been wrong to spend decadesgiving biblical justification to apartheid and advocating certaindiscriminatory laws, such as a ban on mixed marriage.   Its new view, the church said, was that the Bible cannot be usedto support any political model, either apartheid or integration.   Moderator Johan Heyns, elected to head the church during the 1986synod that adopted ``Church and Society,'' said: ``That did notimply we have nothing to say to government. The Bible explicitlytells us there are certain major, universal, applicable, ethicalnorms which are of paramount importance for political policy.''   ``Church and Society'' urges the National Party government touphold Scriptural norms, calls the withholding of political rightsan affront to human dignity and asks authorities ``to give ongoingand sympathetic attention'' to regulations people find offensive.   Some critics argue the church still gets involved in politics butthat its involvement is tolerated because it is regarded as ``theNational Party at prayer.'' As an example, critics cite the churchleaders' recent urging of congregations to sign petitions opposinginternational sanctions against South Africa.   ``Some individuals in English-speaking churches see in the NGK agovernment-supporting church,'' said Heyns. ``That worries me. We donot support the government, but we have so many members ingovernment we are responsible to them spiritually.''   The church is in the position of seeking to represent theinterests of its flock, mainly white Afrikaners, while it isofficially open to all races. It calls for speedier change ofpolicies it once said were biblically justified and tries not to beseen as engaging in politics in a country where, Heyns says,``everything is seen from a political view.''   In July, the church magazine, Die Kerkbode, questioned themorality of indefinitely stationing South African troops in Angola,where Cuban troops support a Marxist government. Two months later,the South African troops withdrew.   A few weeks after church leaders said they had spoken to Law andOrder Minister Adriaan Vlok about detentions without trial,particularly of children, Vlok announced that all detainees under 16had been released. The large majority of those detained are blacks.   The church said that since the government has made it legal forpeople of different races to marry, it now is wrong not to allowthem to live together where they choose. In October, Parliament'swhite chamber passed a bill that would allow the country's firstlegal, multiracial residential areas.   Recently, Heyns has spoken to President Botha about NelsonMandela, the imprisoned African National Congress leader, and aboutthe fate of the Sharpeville Six, a group of blacks sentenced to hangfor participation in the mob killing of a black town councillor.   Heyns would not disclose details of the discussions.   ``We are active in these sort of deliberations,'' but cannotclaim credit for the government's decisions, he said. ``The churchand state are completely independent.''   He and other Dutch Reformed Church leaders disagree strongly withwhat they call the ``political activism'' of Desmond Tutu, the blackAnglican archbishop who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, and theRev. Allan Boesak, head of the mixed-race Dutch Reformed Church inSouth Africa and president of the World Alliance of ReformedChurches.   The alliance disassociated itself with the NGK over apartheid,and Boesak opposes reconciliation until the white church uses itsinfluence more emphatically to end apartheid and bring about aone-person, one-vote political system.   The NGK says its members should obey the authorities and supportsthe government in maintaining law and order. Boesak maintains thatthe government is illegitimate, on both theological and politicalgrounds, and favors a church-led campaign of civil disobedience.   Heyns said: ``We personally think that the moment they (activistclergymen) are going to prescribe to government what structureshould be created, they deviate from a pure, church and biblicalview. They become politicians.   ``That is exactly what we did in the past _ present to thegovernment a political model.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs Nov. 16</NOTE></DOC>
