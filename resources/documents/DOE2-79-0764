Thesystem allows several zones to be completed with a single gravel packingassembly. However, selective production or injection is achieved as thoughthe zones were completed separately. The basic design has proven to beadaptable to the development of modified systems for special applications.These include high temperature steam systems, which use expansion jointsand thermal packers, which use expansion joints and thermal packers,as well as the configuration of three and four zone hookups. The systemhas been run in excess of 500 times by major operators in several SouthernSan Joaquin Valley, California fields.</TEXT></DOC>
