Schools were closed, a professional basketball game was canceled,and some fans were stranded in the arena. Snipers fired at police,who cordoned off a 130-block area of the predominantly blackOvertown neighborhood.   After nightfall, authorities told law-abiding citizens to remainindoors and began a block-by-blok sweep.   ``For the sake of our city, I appeal to every citizen regardlessof race to stay calm, get off the streets and stay in your homes,said Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez in a televised appeal Tuesday night.   ``We are arresting people and we are being a lot more aggressivein the enforcement of the law and I think we have to be,'' Suarezadded. ``I don't think this will continue after today.''   Authorities said Overtown, just north of downtown, was largelyquiet after police entered. By 11:30 p.m., about 150 people had beenarrested, mostly for looting.   But the violence already had spread to Liberty City, a separateblack community several miles to the northwest, where looting andgunfire continued Tuesday night.   Police said they made an arrest in the fatal shooting of a youngblack man in Liberty City at 10:20 p.m., but hadn't determined if itwas related to the rioting.   Officer Eric Butler, wearing a bulletproof vest, was shot in thevest at 9:30 p.m. by a sniper who was later arrested on top of athree-story building. Butler was not seriously injured.   Plans were made for up to 500 National Guard troops to bemobilized within two hours if the violence continued, said BrianBallard, a spokesman for Gov. Bob Martinez.   Top police officials said the tough stance would not bring aviolent reaction because only a few people were violating the law.   Trouble erupted again Tuesday afternoon when a white man in aluxury car reportedly fired into a crowd of blacks in the area,wounding one person before driving away.   ``All I know is that one person was hit in the side,'' policespokesman Angelo Bitsis said, adding that the unidentified victimwas hospitalized in fair condition.   Sporadic gunfire continued throughout the day. Police saidofficers rescued one shooting victim while under fire, returned fireat another man, injuring him in the leg, and shot an alleged sniperin the leg.   Another man was shot in the thigh in a gun battle between two menin a store and a gang of looters. Later, a man with a bullet woundin his leg was arrested when he showed up at a hospital fortreatment. An eighth person was shot in the leg in Liberty City.   About 25 youths shattered car windows outside the Miami Arena onthe border of Overtown, where the National Basketball Association'sMiami Heat was scheduled to play the Phoenix Suns Tuesday night. Thegame was canceled.   A meat truck was looted and one white motorist was beaten afterhis car broke down in Overtown.   The car of Associated Press photographer Mark Pesetsky was burnedand he was roughed up by a mob but not seriously hurt when heattempted to take pictures of the crowd that had gathered near thesite of Tuesday's shooting.   Police fired tear gas at the crowd and in turn were pelted byrocks and bottles. They then sealed off a several block area andshots could be heard from within.   ``I saw someone coming around a building and throwing rocks, andI said `Let's go, get out of here,''' Pesetsky said. At least onecar also was burned in Liberty City.   The FBI announced that it would open an investigation into Mondaynight's shooting to determine whether there were civil rightsviolations, Miami bureau spokesman George Kiszynski said.   ``I can't tell you how long it will take, but it will be anextensive and thorough investigation and it will be done as promptlyas possible,'' Kiszynski said.   Meanwhile, a passenger on the motorcycle who was injured when thedriver crashed into a car after the shooting died Tuesday at JacksonMemorial Hospital of massive head injuries, spokeswoman BettyBaderman said.   Suarez, one of the targets of rock and bottle throwing Mondaynight, spent Tuesday meeting with black leaders and residents ofOvertown, a neighborhood of rundown, low-slung apartment buildingsand trash-strewn vacant lots, just north of downtown Miami.   ``People are angry, people want a full explanation of whathappened,'' said Suarez, who also expressed particular concern aboutthe damage to Miami's image less than a week before the city is hostto the Super Bowl.   At least two buildings and three cars were burned in the rioting,which broke out about two hours after a white police officer shotand killed a black motorcyclist being chased for a trafficinfraction. No damage estimates were available.   Authorities said seven civilians and three of the 280 policeofficers called to the scene were injured.   Police guarded a 130-block area of Overtown on Tuesday, warningmotorists who passed through that they could not be guaranteedprotection. Six schools were closed and some buses were rerouted,but authorities refused to declare an evening curfew.   The disturbance recalled the bloody 1980 riot in adjacent LibertyCity that also was linked to the death of a black motorcyclist atthe hands of white officers. A similar disturbance broke out in 1982when a black man was shot to death only a few blocks from where thelatest incident began.   On Monday, Clement Lloyd, 23, died following a police chase thatstarted just after 6 p.m.   Bitsis said Lloyd and a passenger on his motorcycle sped past apolice officer, who gave chase. Then the motorcycle headed down astreet where another officer, William Lozano, was taking a reportfrom a crime victim.   ``He heard the radio transmission and saw the motorcycle comingin his direction,'' Bitsis said. ``As the motorcycle eitherapproached him or went by him, he fired his shot.''   The bullet hit Lloyd in the head, killing him, and the motorcyclethen crashed into a car. Allen Blanchard, 24, a passenger on themotorcycle, died Tuesday.   By 8 p.m. an angry crowd had surrounded the police and news mediavehicles gathered at the spot, and the violence began, with rocksand bottles thrown at police, reporters and their cars.   Crowds of up to 100 people roamed the streets, smashingwindshields, burning vehicles, looting some stores and occasionallyfiring weapons at police.   Lozano, 29, a four-year veteran of the force, was automaticallysuspended with pay pending an investigation into whether he usedexcessive force.   Many in Miami's black community said they were tired of policeviolence, saying nothing has changed despite promises by Suarez andother officials who courted black votes.   Suarez strongly denied that the attention paid to newly arrivingNicaraguan refugees had created ill-will in the black community, butblack leaders did not agree.   ``In this tremendous influx of refugees from Central and SouthAmerica, the African-Americans have felt cheated. We felt we werelosing our place in the city,'' said Johnnie McMillian, president ofthe Miami-Dade branch of the NAACP.   The scene of Monday's disturbance was about 15 miles from JoeRobbie Stadium, site of the Super Bowl.   But the Cincinnati Bengals are staying less than a mile away, atthe Omni Hotel.</TEXT></DOC>
