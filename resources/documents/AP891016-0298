The restrictions would permanently prohibit smoking on nearlyall scheduled flights within American territory. There are about16,000 airline flights scheduled daily within the United States,and one tobacco industry lobbyist said he believed the rule wouldallow smoking on about 55 flights per day.   But lobbyist Jo Ellen Deutsch of the Association of FlightAttendants said she thought smoking would be permitted on fewerthan 20 flights per day.   ``We've now gotten it down to the point where we have virtuallybanned smoking on airplanes,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,one of the architects of the provision.   Flights from the West Coast to Hawaii and Alaska are scheduledfor less than six hours and would be covered by the ban, Lautenbergand others said.   But smoking would be permitted on non-stop flights scheduled atmore than six hours to or from those states and points further East.   The prohibition would also apply to flights to or from U.S.possessions in the Caribbean, but not to and from Guam.   Each leg of a non-stop flight counts as a separate flight underthe smoking ban. Thus a New York-Hawaii flight with a stop in SanFrancisco would be non-smoking: the New York-San Francisco segmentwould count as a domestic flight; the San Francisco-Hawaii segmentwould be covered because it is scheduled for less than six hours.   The scheduled time is what counts: Passengers could not light upif the San Francisco-Hawaii leg is delayed in the air to take morethan six hours.   Current law prohibits smoking on flights of two hours or less,covering 80 percent of U.S. routes. Those restrictions arescheduled to expire in April 1990.   The new rules will take effect 95 days after they are signedinto law.   The smoking provision is part of a bill appropriating $11.9billion for transportation programs in the fiscal year that beganOct. 1. The House and Senate members of the conference committeestill have to agree on other disputed provisions before the billcan go back to the two chambers for approvial of the final versionto be sent to President Bush for signing into law.   Lautenberg and Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., who helped write theprohibition, predicted the measure would be approved in theirchambers.   ``The tobacco lobby will realize it could have been worse andaccept it,' Durbin said.   Charlie Whitley, a consultant to the Tobacco Institute, thetrade group for cigarette manufacturers, said the industry washappy that a permanent ban on all flights had been averted.   ``As much as it preserves, we'll take that,'' he told a reporterafter the session.   Whitley said cigarette makers hope that a Department ofTransportation study on airline cabin air quality, due out earlynext year, will show that smoking is not the only problem withcabin air, and will suggest ways to recycle it better.   ``Cigarette smoke is a little like a canary in a coal mine,''said Whitley, a former Democratic congressman from North Carolina.``You can see it and smell it, when there are all these otherthings in the air, too.''   Health advocates and leaders of airline unions, who have arguedthat tobacco smoke in a confined aircraft cabin is unhealthy fornon-smokers, were elated.   ``I'm feeling very good,'' said M. Arnita Hannon, lobbyist forthe American Lung Association. ``Essentially, we've covered 99percent of the flights.''   The provision was a compromise between the Senate, which soughta permanent ban on all U.S. flights, and the House, which preferredmaking permanent the current two-hour restrictions.   During talks that lasted several hours, Lautenberg initiallysaid he would insist that if House negotiators did not adopt theSenate language, he would force the House to vote on his proposal.He said he would believed he would have prevailed on the Housefloor.   But after House Whip William H. Gray III, D-Pa., and severalothers objected, Lautenberg accepted the compromise, which wasoffered by Rep. Martin Sabo, D-Minn.   ``I just felt it was a long, a very, very long time for peoplenot to be smoking,'' Sabo said of the flights lasting more than sixhours.   The House voted 259-169 on Aug. 2 to make permanent the currentban on smoking on airline flights of two hours or less. Thatprohibition, which covers four-fifths of all domestic flights, hasbeen in effect since April 1988.   On Sept. 14, the Senate voted 77-21 to end delaying tactics bytobacco-state lawmakers who were trying to block a permanentextension of that ban to all flights. The chamber then adopted thestricter rules on a voice vote.</TEXT></DOC>
