The networks, called Galileo and Amadeus, will replace thefragmented reservation systems of Europe's national airlines, whichcritics say discriminate against smaller airlines and hampercompetition on this side of the Atlantic, where fares are higherthan in the United States.   The two groups of European airlines backing the competingnetworks claim their technological sophistication will make travelagencies more productive and better inform travelers.   More important, the airlines promise that the systems will beneutral _ meaning they won't favor individual carriers. Any airlinewill be able to have its flight information listed in thesesystems, for a fee.   ``Our ultimate customer is the person who chooses to travel ornot to travel. We want to make his journey more cost-efficient andtime-efficient,'' said Justin Dukes, chief executive of Galileo.   Bernard Anques, strategic planner for Amadeus, says the system``will enable the travel passenger, especially the businesspassenger, to have better products at a best price. The consumerwill be better off.''   But not everyone is convinced that the new systems will fostercompetition. Critics say the smaller airlines will remain at adisadvantage because the new networks are owned largely by bigcarriers.   Existing systems have been accused of burying competitors'flight information or delaying its entry into the computer,charging high fees to list competitors, unfairly exploiting theiraccess to competitors' schedules and fares, and locking travelagents into long contracts with high cancellation fees.   Such criticisms have dogged the five airline-owned reservationsystems in the United States, where a congressional study recentlycriticized the systems for stifling competition and padding profitsfor their airline owners. Although the airlines that own thesystems are prohibited from listing their flights first, thesystems still give those carriers a big advantage, the study said.   Critics of the European systems warn that because the two newnetworks are separate, the skies will be ruled by two big blocs ofairlines, and that until they interconnect, the traveler cannot beassured of access to the full range of flights available on aparticular route.   Hugh Welburn, managing director of Travel Trends International,a London research firm, said, ``One of the effects is likely to bean increase in the power of the bigger airlines against the small.Basically they offer the provider of the systems an opportunity tohandicap competitors, especially smaller competitors.''   Ultimately, experts predict, Galileo and Amadeus willinterconnect. ``Technological development is bound to provide meansof linking these two systems. The effect of that would be to makemore choices available to the consumer,'' Welburn said.   Swindon, England-based Galileo, whose airlines carry a total of120 million passengers a year, is made up of shareholders BritishAirways, KLM Royal Dutch Airways, Swissair, Aer Lingus, Alitalia,Austrian Airlines, Olympic Airways, Sabena, TAP Air Portugal, andCovia.   Covia, which operates the U.S.-based Apollo computer reservationsystem, is 51 percent owned by United Airlines.   Madrid-based Amadeus, whose airlines carry 91 million passengersannually, is made up of partners Air France, Iberia, Lufthansa andScandinavian Airlines System, plus eight associate airlines.   Like other airlines, the network owners will have to pay to usethe system and have their flight information listed. Fees will varydepending on the services the customers take and the competitiveconditions in the geographical area.   The owners believe the networks, which also will includeinformation about train, ferry, hotel and car reservations, willmake them money as the European airline industry slowly becomesderegulated, which should encourage people to travel more.   More deregulation will bring a confusing array of new routes andfares, which will have to be put into some kind of order if theyare to be sold successfully.   Already, deregulation has spawned small independent airlineslike Virgin Atlantic Airways of Britain, the French Air Liberte,and Transavia-Holland.   Observers say fare wars could break out after 1992, when the12-nation European Economic Community is to become one barrier-freemarketplace of 320 million consumers.   U.S. computer reservation systems were the first to enter theEuropean market in pursuit of post-deregulation opportunities.United Airlines and American Airlines started selling their systemsin Europe in 1985, way ahead of Galileo and Amadeus.   Underscoring how big the stakes are, British Airways refused tolet American Airlines' Sabre system issue British Airways tickets _even though it had been doing so in the United States _ until June,when the two airlines reached a settlement.   The market is ripe for selling more automation, since only 65percent of the International Air Transport Association's (IATA)10,500 licensed travel agencies have computer terminals, comparedwith almost all 26,500 U.S. agencies in the International AirlinesTravel Agent Network.   Systems already are going global. For example, Amadeus intendsto sign a cooperation agreement with Abacus, an Asian system.   So far, official efforts by the EEC and others to produce codesof conduct to govern the new systems have been piecemeal, and theirconclusions may vary, said David Kyd, an IATA spokesman.   But proponents of the systems believe the new networks will aidconsumers by moving more reservation-making to the travel agents,away from the individual airlines, thus dampening the incentive forbiased booking.   ``I think all competition tends to ensure that the consumer getsthe best possible value. If the customer can choose the best fareroute, ... that is what the system will ensure,'' Galileo's Dukessaid.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Sept. 24-25</NOTE></DOC>
