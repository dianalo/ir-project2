Goldwin's principal concern, it seems, is to denythat the right to keep and bear arms precludes the power toregulate gun ownership and use. Few would disagree. Evenactivities protected by the First Amendment may be regulatedwhen they threaten the rights of others.   But Mr. Goldwin also writes that &quot;The right to bear armsprotected in the Second Amendment has to do directly with `awell-regulated militia'&quot;; thus, arguably, he continues, &quot;ifyou want to own a gun, sign up with the National Guard.&quot;Clearly, this goes well beyond regulating to protect therights of others. This would condition the &quot;right&quot; to keepand bear arms on joining the National Guard.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Goldwin's mistake stems from his having confused anecessary with a sufficient condition. The Second Amendment,in its language and its history, makes plain that the needfor a well-regulated militia is a sufficient condition forthe right to keep and bear arms. Yet Mr. Goldwin treats it asa necessary condition, which enables him to conclude thatCongress could deny an individual the right to own a gun ifhe did not join the National Guard.   Mr. Goldwin makes this mistake, in turn, because he hasmisread Madison's original version of the Second Amendment,which exempted conscientious objectors from military service.Thus he says that &quot;In this version, `bearing arms' must mean`to render military service,' or why else would there have tobe an exemption for religious reasons? What right must not beinfringed? The right of the people to serve in the militia.&quot;   Plainly, any conscientious-objector provision would arisenot from a right but from a duty to serve in the militia. YetMr. Goldwin believes the amendment means, as he later says,&quot;that the right to bear arms meant the right to serve in themilitia.&quot; Thus does he reduce the first of these rights tothe second, when clearly it is much broader.   Roger Pilon   Senior Fellow and Director   Center for Constitutional Studies   CATO Institute   Washington   ---   The militia is not the National Guard but rather thepeople of the original states. In Ohio, we have an Ohiomilitia that is not a part of the National Guard. The fear ofstanding armies and the control these armed men gave acentral government was foremost in the Framers' minds whenwriting the Bill of Rights. Thomas Jefferson moved to preventthis type of power in a few people's hands by the SecondAmendment. He stated, &quot;No free man shall ever be debarred theuse of arms.&quot;   The addition in the early drafts of aconscientious-objector clause was added for the preservationof religious freedoms, which the Colonists had not had inEngland. It is unfortunate today's &quot;scholars&quot; seem to spendtheir time picking apart history and the great thoughts ofthe visionary men who formed this country.   In my personal celebration of this 200-year-old document,I have pledged the following: I will give up my freedom ofspeech when they cut out my tongue; I will give up my rightto worship when they have slain my God and myself; I willassemble with the people of my choice even when they areimprisoned, and I will give up my rifle when they pry my colddead fingers from around it.   Samuel R. Bush III   Cincinnati   ---   Let those who want guns join the National Guard, says Mr.Goldwin. Ah, the sanctimonious arrogance of it. What givesMr. Goldwin the right to deny mine when I abide by the laws?   He stresses the differences between the world of 1791 andtoday to suit his prejudice. He studiously ignores othermajor differences between 1791 and today.   In 1791, punishment was swifter and surer. Plea bargainingwas not epidemic; judges did not provide revolving doors onprisons. There was no army of drug dealers and junkiespreying on the public. If anything, the reasons for citizensto own weapons for self-defense are more compelling todaythan they were in 1791.   Let Mr. Goldwin show us how he would make us safer in ourhomes and we might understand his wish to strip away our onlysure defense.   Carl Roessler   San Francisco   ---   Mr. Goldwin's article is a casebook example of convolutedlogic.   Consider that George Mason (1725-1792), the great Virginiaconstitutionalist, defined quite clearly the meaning of theword &quot;militia&quot; during a debate in 1788. &quot;I ask who are themilitia?&quot; he said, and then answered his own question withthe words: &quot;They consist now of the whole people&quot; (emphasisadded). Mason's credentials are reliable: He is the author ofthe first 10 amendments to our Constitution. {There is adebate about who actually drafted the amendments -- Mason orMadison}.   Further, a 1903 U.S. law defined the militia as not onlythe National Guard, but all able-bodied males between 18 and45.   I, along with millions of other Americans, am not againstsensible gun control, i.e., licensing, character searches,etc. What I resent is Mr. Goldwin's agenda, which is removalof all guns from American citizens through the implementationof total regulations; a direct violation of the SecondAmendment through nefarious means.   Edward F. Menninger   Sterling Heights, Mich.   ---   Mr. Goldwin suggests gun control via enlistment in theNational Guard. Swell idea. Updating the right to bear armsfrom 1791 to 1991, when I report for service I'll bring, asrequired, a few items consistent with the currentinfantryman's inventory: a Barett Light .50 semiautomaticsniper rifle, so I can reach out and touch people half a mileaway; a Squad Automatic Weapon firing 5.56mm rounds at therate of a whole lot per second out of 30-round clips orhundred-round belts; a 40mm grenade launcher . . . but youget the idea. Then, as a thoroughly modern, well-regulatedmilitiaman, I'll take my weapons home, just as did Morgan'sriflemen, and the musket bearers of Lexington and Concord,and the Colonial light artillerists.
