(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman was carried Monday from the siteof the motel where Martin Luther King Jr. was killed, but she movedher two-year protest against construction at the motel all of 50feet.   Two femal sheriff's deputies, enforcing a court order, liftedJacqueline Smith from a lawn chair and hauled her, unresisting,across the street.   She had refused to leave her makeshift camp in front aconstruction site at The Lorraine Motel, which was shut down inJanuary 1988 to make way for a museum called the National CivilRights Center. She has camped in front of The Lorraine sincedeputies evicted her from the motel itself on March 2, 1988.   Ms. Smith, 39, contends The Lorraine should be used as housingfor the homeless, as a medical clinic or for some other suchpurpose.   ``This protest must continue,'' she said after pitching her tentanew on a sidewalk across the street from the construction site.   A half-dozen sheriff's deputies waded through about 50 gawkers,news reporters and supporters of Ms. Smith to pluck her from hercamp. She didn't resist.   Tom Marshall, a deputy chief with the Shelby County Sheriff'sDepartment, said the court order required only that she leave theconstruction site.   Construction workers moved her tent and other belongings intothe street and closed in a chain-link fence behind her.   Shortly after the eviction, Ms. Smith restablished her camp buton the opposite side of the small side street.   ``They've torn it up. Look at it,'' she said of the motel. ``Itwon't be The Lorraine Motel again.''   Museum developers say the wing of the motel where King was shotwill be restored to the way it looked when he was assassinatedApril 4, 1968. The museum will center on that wing. Much of TheLorraine has been demolished.   The court order to move Ms. Smith was issued Friday after theconstruction manager for the museum said she was in the way.   Until then, museum developers had pretty much ignored her. Citypolice have made no attempt to move her.   Police spokesman John Bennett said that has been considered thestate's responsibility since the museum project is under statesupervision.   State officials bumped the responsibility for moving Ms. Smithto the construction company.   The Lorraine was crumbling in disrepair in 1982 when a group ofconcerned citizens raised $140,000 to buy it at a foreclosureauction.   The group, called The Lorraine Civil Rights Museum Foundation,spent the next several years persuading the state, county and citygovernments to build the museum.</TEXT></DOC>
