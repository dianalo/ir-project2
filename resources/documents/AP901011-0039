(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Well-dressed mannequins don't fool him.Nor does iced champagne disguised as a baby.   Highway Patrol Officer Alvin Yamaguchi watches the car-poollanes in Los Angeles, searching for people trying to beat thetwo-to-a-car minimum.   ``People will try anything to fool us,'' Yamaguchi said.   Take the woman driving a Mercedes-Benz. She used a departmentstore mannequin with $100 sunglasses, makeup and stylish clothes.   Then there was the man with a baby seat covered by a blanket.   ``I pointed at him to take it off,'' he said. ``When he didthere was a bottle of champagne on ice.''   Others pose mannequins in a sleeping posture. Then there are thedrivers who pretend to have lively discussions with their inanimatepassengers.   Nearly 9,000 people were cited for car-pool lane violations onLos Angeles freeways last year, despite fines that jump to $613.50for people caught three times within two years.   Once caught, some commuters resort to logic. Their logic.Pregnant women have argued to no avail they were carrying a secondpassenger. One undertaker thought the dead body in the back wouldqualify. He lost, too.   Motorists delight in pointing out violators to the patrol.   ``They love it when we pull (violators) over,'' Yamaguchi said.``They'll honk then, too, and wave and smile.''   Yamaguchi's favorite is the driver seated beside a Germanshepherd secured by a safety belt.   ``This guy told me that he shouldn't get cited because the dogwas a family member,'' Yamaguchi said.</TEXT></DOC>
