Statistics show that one out of four Americans over theage of 65 will go into a nursing home. But a nursing home cancost $25,000 to $70,000 a year, and the government won't pickup the bill until you have virtually no assets.</LP><TEXT>   Welcome to the world of Medicaid planning, where theprimary goal is to shift assets, divert income and structurefinances so that you can get Medicaid coverage withoutleaving your spouse bankrupt.   &quot;It has to be one of the hot topics of the decade,&quot; saysAlexander Bove, Boston lawyer and author of asoon-to-be-published guide, &quot;The Medicaid Planning Handbook.&quot;   It is also one of the more controversial. Medicaidplanning has been characterized by many as the province ofwelfare cheats. The field makes even advocates of seniorcitizens uncomfortable. The American Association of RetiredPersons, for example, deliberately chooses not to advisepeople on Medicaid planning, which it sees as outside &quot;thespirit of the law,&quot; says AARP health lobbyist Tricia Smith.   Others, comparing themselves to tax planners, say theproblem lies with the flawed health-care system that canimpoverish senior citizens. &quot;If the government allows it, itcan't be immoral,&quot; says Cleveland lawyer Armond Budish,author of &quot;Avoiding the Medicaid Trap.&quot; &quot;It is crazy, but notimmoral.&quot;   To qualify for Medicaid, a joint federal-state program forthe poor, a person must be 65 years or older (or blind orphysically or mentally disabled) and be within the state'sincome limit. Typically, a Medicaid recipient's assets can'ttotal more than $2,000, although some states set the amounthigher.   But not all assets are counted when determining Medicaideligibility. Consider a couple of hypothetical examples.   John and Mary own a $400,000 house and have put most oftheir life savings into annuity contracts that produce incomepayable to Mary. When John enters a nursing home, hequalifies for Medicaid immediately. The reason: The house isa noncountable asset and the a spouse gets to keep all of herown income.   Frederic and Martha rent an apartment in Boston but own a$200,000 condominium in Florida. They have $200,000 in stocksand bonds. When Frederic enters a Massachusetts nursing home,he gets no Medicaid until he has exhausted $333,520 of hisassets. Why? His assets are all countable, and his wife getsto retain only half of their assets up to $66,480.   Clearly, paying attention to what is countable and wherethe income goes makes a big difference in who ends up footingthe nursing-home bill.   Here's how it works. At the time someone enters a nursinghome, a &quot;snapshot&quot; of family assets is taken to determine thespouse's share. With a married couple, the assets that aren'tcounted typically include the family home and householdbelongings, a segregated burial account, burial plots, somelife insurance policies and one automobile.   As for the countable assets, it makes no difference whichspouse inherited the ATandamp;T stock or which bought the Treasurybonds. All countable assets are pooled for the &quot;snapshot&quot; atthe time of institutionalization. Even prenuptial agreementsas to who owns what offer no such protection under Medicaidlaw.   The goal of Medicaid planning is to take advantage of thenon-countable assets to shelter assets, to shift income tothe healthy spouse and to either give away assets or put themsafely into a variety of trusts that shield them fromMedicaid.   One option is to use the family home, says Mr. Budish, theCleveland lawyer. For instance, he says, a couple who owns ahome and has $100,000 in the bank when the husband enters anursing home might use the following strategy: Afterestablishing and separating the wife's share of assets, thehusband could take his $50,000 and pay off the mortgage, puta new roof on the house and buy a refrigerator. &quot;It protectsthose funds,&quot; says Mr. Budish. &quot;The next day you can go toMedicaid and say, `I qualify.'&quot;   Another strategy in some states might be to transfer allassets to the healthy spouse, who legally could then refuseto pay nursing home costs, says New York lawyer Peter J.Strauss. This is a very aggressive strategy that shouldtrigger Medicaid benefits, although the state has the rightto sue for support. But the state may decide not to sue, hesays. Or if it does, it would be required to prove the spousehas the financial ability to contribute. And that might allowthe spouse to retain more assets than the state's officialresource allowance.   Perhaps the best-known technique is the irrevocable trust.A couple can put all their assets into such a trust, whichthen provides them with income, but no principal. If eitherenters a nursing home, the income will be paid to the healthyspouse. At the death of one, the income goes to the survivor.At the death of both, the trust would end, with the balancegoing to the children.   The drawback, says Mr. Bove of Boston, &quot;is a feeling ofloss of personal control&quot; from the inability to get at thoseassets. As a result, he says many people opt for aconvertible trust, which allows them to keep control whilethey are well, but converts to an irrevocable trust as soonas they enter a nursing home.   In both cases, creation of the irrevocable trust creates awaiting period of as many as 30 months for Medicaid benefits,which is triggered whenever a Medicaid applicant gives awayassets. A major exception: Applicants can transfer anythingthey want to their spouses.   Giving away assets carries other risks. &quot;You give yourmoney to your kids,&quot; and that may bring Medicaid eligibilityafter a 30-month wait, says Mr. Budish. &quot;But the kid couldspend the money, or the kid could die, or the kid could getdivorced.&quot;   Perhaps the most important Medicaid planning tool is thedurable power of attorney. &quot;Everyone should have one,&quot; saysMr. Bove. A durable power of attorney differs from thestandard variety in that it doesn't become void when thegrantor becomes incompetent.   Medicaid planning isn't estate planning, and in fact, thetwo may end up conflicting. For example, it may be in yourinterest to give your ATandamp;T stock to your daughter forMedicaid planning, but she will acquire your basis price andhave to pay capital gains on it when she sells. If sheinherited it, her basis for capital-gains purposes would bethe value of the stock when she inherited it.   Indeed, taxes are only one of the considerations thatmight prompt people to rule out Medicaid as an option. Thequality of Medicaid care, the psychological impact of givingaway one's money and the loss of independence might&quot;outweigh&quot; the financial advantage, says Mr. Strauss.   The real solution, he says, is for the government &quot;toadopt a meaningful health-care system that covers long termcare.&quot; Until then, he says, people should approach Medicaidplanning with caution. &quot;You don't look at Medicaid in theabstract,&quot; he says. &quot;No one of these solutions fits everycase.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
