Finance Minister Hector Hurtado Navarro said in an interview the country has decided to seek &quot;not less than two billion dollars&quot; in new foreign bank loans because of mounting balance-of-payments problems. Such a demand would constitute a radical departure for Venezuela, which has repaid both interest and principal without seeking new money from banks since the international debt crisis broke in 1982, though it has reduced the size of its principal payments.    Mr. Hurtado said that because there are elections in December and the government of President Jaime Lusinchi is keen to avoid any upheaval before then, Venezuela wouldn't press for the new money until 1989. &quot;Without the poll, we should have sought new money this year,&quot; he said.    U.S. bankers predicted long and difficult negotiations over any major Venezuelan bank loan. &quot;We'd have to decide whether to insist on an International Monetary Fund adjustment program and we'd want to see official creditors assuming part of the burden,&quot; said one. International banks are now deeply reluctant to lend to Latin America. Moreover, a loan of this kind would effectively admit Venezuela to the club of problem debtors such as Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.    The Venezuelan debt question may become particularly difficult because the December election is likely to give former President Carlos Andres Perez a comfortable victory over his main rival, Eduardo Fernandez. Although Mr. Perez comes from the same Accion Democratica Party as President Lusinchi, he is more outspoken on the debt question.    &quot;It is impossible that Venezuela go on paying unless creditors recycle part of our payments,&quot; Mr. Perez said in an interview. Describing the IMF as a vehicle for &quot;economic totalitarianism,&quot; he said Latin America's fourth-largest debtor had got &quot;absolutely nothing&quot; from paying interest as well as principal. He said there would have been a military coup in Peru if President Alan Garcia in 1985 hadn't declared a ceiling on interest payments of 10% of export revenue. Future Venezuelan payments, he declared in language reminiscent of Mr. Garcia's, would have to be linked to &quot;our export earnings, new credits and reasonable interest rates.&quot;    Mr. Perez didn't have to deal with the debt issue during his last period of rule a decade ago. Some of his rhetoric may be electioneering; he has a reputation for being more pragmatic than he sounds. Nevertheless, his stance illustrates how acutely the debt problem is felt even in South America's wealthiest nation, whose oil reserves and political stability make it an attractive long-term risk to banks.    Because oil accounts for about 90% of Venezuelan exports, low oil prices have crippled the country's ability to pay. Oil earnings have plunged to $9.1 billion last year from $14.8 billion in 1984. Every dollar off the price of a barrel cuts about $500 million in revenue. Non-oil exports, meanwhile, have only crept up to $1.3 billion in 1987 from $1.2 billion in 1984.    The result, despite a contraction of food, textile and other imports, has been a plunge in foreign-exchange reserves to an estimated $3 billion in the past two years from $9.9 billion. Gold reserves total between $5 billion and $6 billion but, says Mr. Hurtado, &quot;there is a fetish here about not touching them.&quot;    Economist Pedro Palma warns that imports can't be cut further without inviting a recession, and he says the country has reached a turning point. &quot;If you want to see big changes in the approach to debt, look at Venezuela next year,&quot; he predicts, adding that the country will be forced to adopt a tougher stance with banks.    A Caracas-based U.S. banker concurred that the country appeared to need &quot;about $2 billion&quot; in fresh funds to see it through the next three years. He predicted banks would be keen to avoid confrontation with a country whose long-term development prospects are viewed as much better than many others in the region.    This year, despite a trade surplus predicted to total $1.8 billion, off slightly from $2 billion in 1987, Venezuela will have to finance a deficit of between $3 billion and $4 billion on its external account following payments of debt interest and principal. Mr. Hurtado said he hopes to achieve this through new trade credits and project-related loans from commercial and export-import banks, further depletion of reserves, gold sales and a possible international bond issue.    &quot;Even then,&quot; he added, &quot;we may not make it.&quot; He didn't elaborate on how any deficit would be met.    Last year, Venezuela signed a $20.34 billion restructuring agreement with creditors, which covered nearly all the country's medium-term and long-term foreign bank debt. The accord extended maturities and cut interest charged to 7/8 of a percentage point over the London interbank offered rate from the previous 1 1/8 point. But it didn't concede any grace period or involve new bank loans.    The accord reduced the size of Venezuela's principal payments to $250 million in 1987, $400 million in 1988 and $700 million in 1989 from previously established sums of more than $1 billion in each of those years.    Mr. Hurtado said the new money Venezuela will seek was only necessary to see it into the 1990s. By then, he argued, new aluminum, petrochemical and mineral industries should provide &quot;about $3 billion a year in additional export revenue.&quot;    But before then, and after the election, some analysts say a major currency devaluation and a determined drive to encourage non-oil exports will have to be pushed through. Although domestic industry has boomed in the past three years, spurred by the need to substitute imports, there has been no accompanying attempt to promote exports. Rather, while the domestic economy has grown between 3% and 6% a year for the past three years, a labyrinthine bureaucracy has stifled industrialists' attempts to sell abroad. </TEXT></DOC>
