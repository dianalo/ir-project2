Family friends say Habib Bourguiba, who turns 85 on Aug. 3, isdeeply unhappy with his life in the secluded villa where he hasbeen kept under house arrest since his ouster eight months ago.   The ailing ex-leader has become virtually a non-person in theTunisia of President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali, who was primeminister when he replaced Bourguiba in a bloodless coup on Nov. 7.   Tunisian media today rarely refer to the man whose word was lawfor more than three decades and whose photograph was once a dailyfixture in the nation's newspapers.   A multitude of bronze statues of Bourguiba in various poses arebeing dismantled without fuss by local authorities throughout thisNorth African Arab nation.   The innumerable streets, avenues and institutions that carry hisname are gradually being renamed.   The dismantling cannot be done too abruptly, the weekly Maghrebnewspaper explained, because ``with all his faults and qualities,he had become a father to us all, a part of our collectiveconsciousness.   ``He was a father, even for his adversaries, for fivegenerations, a father who fascinated us, who inspired fear and whooppressed us. We loved him and then hated him. He ruled us by ourown wish and by fear. We cannot obliterate him from our collectivememory, even if we try,'' the newspaper wrote.   On the day after the coup, newly-named Prime Minister HediBaccouche said Bourguiba would be temporarily confined in the villaat Mornag, 12 miles southeast of the capital.   But, Baccouche added, he would be treated with the ``honor andrespect'' due a great leader and the architect of independence fromFrench colonial rule.   Bourguiba was removed from office after seven prominent Tunisianphysicians declared him mentally and physically crippled bysenility and unfit to carry out his duties.   The constitution provided for the automatic succession of theprime minister, Ben Ali, to the presidency in case of thepresident's death or incapacity.   One of Ben Ali's first acts in office was to change sections ofthe constitution that had been tailor-made for Bourguiba andcontained undemocratic provisions _ such as the automaticsuccession of the prime minister, a presidential appointee.   Only a few of Bourguiba's family members are allowed to visithim in the tree-shaded, single-story Mornag villa. Among them arehis son, former Foreign Minister Habib Bourguiba Jr.   Other politicians and former aides are strictly barred.   Bourguiba's niece, Saida Sassi, who played a key backstage rolein the last years of Bourguiba's rule, has turned his care over toa male nurse and a few servants.   At the height of her power, Mrs. Sassi was reputed to have beenable to make and unmake ministers at will. She was said to be thenation's real ruler because of her influence over Bourguiba.   She lived in the villa for a few weeks after the coup, thenmoved to France.   Sources said Bourguiba deeply resented her departure, whichdeprived him of the last companion with whom he liked to talk. Theweekly Tunis-Hebdo newspaper said Mrs. Sassi left because ``thepatriarch kept beating her with his cane.''   Officials in the Ben Ali government said Bourguiba has firmlyrefused to endorse the nation's new leader.   Few Tunisians now publicly praise Bourguiba's role in thenation's history, but many older officials of the ruling party arebelieved to secretly retain their admiration for him, particularlyin the region of his home town of Monastir in central Tunisia.   During his 32-year virtual dictatorship, he became the firstleader of any Arab nation to grant equal rights to women, tocondemn the crippling annual fas of the religious festival Ramadanand to advocate an Arab peace settlement with Israel.   The government has thus far turned a deaf ear to his request tobe allowed to end his days in Monastir.   Sources say Bourguiba is particularly embittered because Ben Alihas not replied to the three letters Bourguiba has written to hissuccessor since his ouster, one of which asked that he be moved toMonastir.   The two men have not met since the coup.   Because of his weakening eyesight, an employee reads him thenewspaper. The old man watches Tunisian television and Italianbroadcasts from nearby Sicily, but cannot look at the screen forlong periods because of his eyesight.   The nurse accompanies him on his daily walks in the villa'stwo-acre garden. Three successive police checkpoints on the singleapproach road keep outsiders away.   When Bourguiba complained recently that his police guards werethrowing their cigarette butts all over his garden, Ben Ali sent ateam of gardeners to clean up and rejuvenate the entire property.</TEXT></DOC>
