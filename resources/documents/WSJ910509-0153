Sematech, a semiconductor research group funded in part bythe U.S. government, charged this week that five Japanesemakers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment were settinghigher prices in the U.S. and delaying delivery of theirlatest machines.</LP><TEXT>   Spokesmen for all the Japanese companies denied anydiscrimination against U.S. customers, and said they wereconfident that an investigation by the U.S. GeneralAccounting Office would clear them of wrongdoing.   As Japanese companies become the dominant suppliers of agrowing number of key components for high-technologyproducts, industrial groups in the U.S. and elsewhere haveexpressed worry that they may not have equal access to newtechnology.   Sematech said marketing delays by the Japanese companiesin the U.S. gave Japanese semiconductor makers a head startin using leading technology and were &quot;part of their nation'sstrategy for world-wide domination of the criticalsemiconductor industry,&quot; according to news reports.   It identified the companies as Canon Inc., Nikon Corp.,Hitachi Ltd., Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co. Ltd., and TokyoElectron Ltd. All make equipment used in photolithography orother areas of semiconductor manufacturing.   A Canon spokesman, Nakaba Egawa, called the charges&quot;completely false.&quot; He said the company &quot;offers its latestequipment without exception to every market.   &quot;There is no difference at all in our pricing in differentcountries,&quot; he said.   Nikon said transportation charges, tariffs and higherservice costs overseas &quot;naturally result in higher pricesthan inside Japan,&quot; but denied that it discriminated inpricing.   It said it shipped equipment in the same sequence that itreceived orders from customers.   Tokyo Electron said prices for its products in the U.S.were comparable to Japanese prices. &quot;We absolutely do notwithhold the latest technology,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;All ofour products are released in both markets at the same time.&quot;   The two other companies said they do not currently sellsemiconductor manufacturing equipment in the U.S.   The U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association said that in1980, U.S. companies supplied 75% of the world'ssemiconductor manufacturing equipment and Japanese companiesprovided 16%. By 1989, the U.S. share had fallen to 47% andthe Japanese share had climbed to 42%.   U.S. and Japanese trade officials continue to meet todayover negotiations on an agreement to increase market sharefor foreign semiconductors in Japan. The agreement wouldreplace a five-year pact that expires at the end of July.</TEXT></DOC>
