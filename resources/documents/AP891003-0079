The party, the first ever to lose control of a Soviet blocgovernment, is even considering changing its official name _ thePolish United Workers Party _ as part of its effort to improve itsstanding with the populace.   Opposition candidates virtually swept all seats available tonon-Communist candidates in June's partially free elections.Pro-Solidarity lawmakers eventually put together a coalition withparties that were once allied with the Communists, resulting lastmonth in the first non-Communist government in the East bloc.   In 1993, elections are to be fully democratic, and theCommunists are trying desperately to find a place in the newPoland, which is embracing democratic reforms in a scramble tosalvage its collapsing economy.   A survey released at the start of today's Central Committeeplenum showed that fully 72 percent of the party members favorchanging its name to reflect a change in image and purpose.   Party leaders were expected to set a date and an agenda for aparty congress, which would enact the changes recommended by theCentral Committee. The congress would be a meeting of 1,000 to2,000 delegates elected from among the 2 million rank-and-fileparty members.   The congress is expected to be set for mid-February, said aparty official, demanding anonymity.   The party official said the internal party survey, in which morethan half the members took part, showed there was a strong dangerthat the party could split.   Party chief Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski has warned that a split couldend the party. Accordingly, the plenum has adopted the slogan``Unity at Any Price.''   The official described the split within party ranks as beingbetween the leadership and the rank-and-file members, who favorradical reform, and the ``middle level'' party organizers who wantto maintain a traditional party.   The party official said the goal is to create a party that willbe attractive to voters in the 1993 elections. The party hopes todo well enough in the voting to emerge as the dominant partner in aleftist coalition, he said.   Party Secretary Leszek Miller said the party is inviting societyto ``create the party with us,'' and that the party must strive tofind an identity which will give it a popular base.   ``The question is whether the Polish United Workers Party canfulfill the aspirations of the part of Polish society which isleft-leaning,'' he said.   The plenum also is expected to support internal party democracy,a state-dominated economy for Poland, and instigate a shakeup ofthe ruling Politburo. It would be the second leadership shufflesince July, the official said.   ``If we remain in unity for three months, then we exist and wewill win,'' the official said. ``If the party is destroyed, thenthe left does not exist for practical purposes for many years.''   The pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza reported today thatthe draft resolution for the plenum called for development of a``humanitarian, democratic and effective socialism.''   On the economic front, the draft favors a multi-sector economydominated by the state-run economy. It opposes selling off stateenterprises, a chief economic goal of the Solidarity-led government.   The draft also ``obliges all party cells to create conditionsfor free expression of different views,'' the newspaper said.</TEXT></DOC>
