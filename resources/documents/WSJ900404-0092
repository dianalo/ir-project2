The spokesman, Makoto Yamanaka, said Japan has agreed toconduct the bidding in an &quot;open, transparent andnondiscriminatory&quot; manner. U.S. officials acknowledged thatsuch an understanding had been reached, but didn't providedetails.</LP><TEXT>   The agreement in principle brought the two governmentsclose to settling the second of three trade disputes raisedunder the so-called Super 301 provision of the U.S. tradelaw. Earlier, the two sides agreed on the conditions throughwhich the U.S. can sell supercomputers to Japanese publicagencies. The Super 301 statute authorizes the U.S. to slapstiff trade sanctions on countries that don't meet itsrequirements.   The prospective satellite accord makes a distinctionbetween research satellites, which Tokyo has the right toindependently develop, and commercial satellites, which it isrequired to procure from the most competitive sources. Suchan accord would allow Japan's National Aeronautics and SpaceDevelopment Agency to develop its projected researchsatellites on its own. However, satellites that Japanacquires for broadcast, weather-monitoring and othercommercial functions would be subject to open bidding.   Other Japanese officials said the accord eventually willlead to the purchase of a U.S.-made satellite by NHK, Japan'spublic broadcasting corporation.   The accord, however, takes Japan's separate CS4 satelliteproject out of the reach of U.S. vendors because it will beconverted into a purely government-financed research project.The U.S. earlier protested that the project had commercialimplications because of NTT's participation in it. The accordwill remove NTT from working on the CS4 satellite.   Mr. Yamanaka said the satellite accord still has to beformalized by an exchange of letters between the twogovernments.   U.S. and Japanese officials are still negotiating asettlement of the third dispute, a U.S. complaint that Japanunfairly restricts imports of forest products.</TEXT></DOC>
