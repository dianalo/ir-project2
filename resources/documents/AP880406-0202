The Arab hijackers forced the airliner to fly to Iran on Monday.   Their nationality and identity remain unknown, but speculationarose that they might be part of an Iranian-linked network ofterrorists.   Kuwait, a small, oil-rich desert emirate caught in the crossfireof the Iran-Iraq war, refuses to free any of the 17 prisoners andreiterated Tuesday that Kuwait will not bow to ``blackmail.''   The passengers and crew held hostage aboard Kuwait AirwaysFlight 422 have apparently become pawns in a war between followersof Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and foes of his Islamic revolution.   The same could be said about Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, and educator ThomasSutherland, two Americans held captive in Lebanon since 1985.   Kuwait is a conservative state ruled by Sunni Moslems, historicrivals of the Shiite sect who make up the vast majority of Iran's50 million people.   Kuwait fears that Iran's fundamentalist Islamic revolution willspread, inciting its Shiite minority to revolt.   Other Arab neighbors of Iran in the Persian Gulf have similarfears.   Spurred by Khomeini's revolution and by the 1982 invasion ofLebanon by Israel, Lebanon's Shiites launched suicide bombingsagainst the Israelis and later against U.S. and French troops whotook part in an ill-fated multinational peacekeeping force inLebanon.   Shiite extremists have targeted Kuwait in particular over thepast five years. Iran accuses Kuwait of aiding Iraq in the PersianGulf war.   The 17 prisoners in Kuwait were convicted of bombings in 1983that killed five people and wounded 86, culminating in attacks onthe U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait.   Later terrorist attacks on Kuwait included an abortive 1985assassination attempt on the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah.   Three of the 17 prisoners _ two Iraqis and a Lebanese identifiedas Elias Fuad Saab _ were sentenced to death.   The Shiite kidnappers in Lebanon are concerned in particularabout Saab, whose real name is Mustafa Youssef. He is a cousin ofImad Mugniyeh, believed by Western and Lebanese intelligence to bethe mastermind of Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, and other extremistShiite factions responsible for suicide bombings, kidnappings andaircraft hijackings in recent years.   Western intelligence officials believe Saab rigged the bombsused in the Kuwait attacks.   Kuwait has so far not carried out any of the executions, butthat seems to have been its only concession. It has arrested dozensof other Shiites for sabotage since 1983.   Mugniyeh, 36, is a key figure in the security apparatus ofHezbollah, or Party of God, an Iranian-backed Shiite movementbelieved to be the umbrella for factions holding most of the 22foreign hostages in Lebanon.   His family has been long linked with the Hamadis, another Shiiteclan involved in kidnappings.   U.S. authorities identified Mugniyeh and Mohammed Ali Hamadi,held in West Germany on charges of smuggling explosives, as two ofthe four Lebanese Shiites involved in the June 1985 hijacking of aTWA airliner in which U.S. Navy diver Robert Dean Stethem waskilled.   The Hamadis allegedly kidnapped three West Germans in Beiruttrying to force West Germany to free Mohammed and a brother, Abbas,who now is on trial in Duesseldorf for kidnapping two Germans. Athird Hamadi brother, Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, is Hezbollah's securitychief in Beirut.   Members of the Mugniyeh family are thought to have kidnappedAnderson, who was seized March 16, 1985, and is the longest held ofthe missing foreigners.</TEXT></DOC>
