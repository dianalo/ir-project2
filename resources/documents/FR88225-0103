LicenseNo. 22-00057-06 was issued on February 17, 1964, was most recently amendedon May 6, 1987, and expires on May 31, 1992. This license authorizes thelicensee to use a variety of radionuclides, including polonium-210 (Po-210),and to conduct a variety of activities with these materials including manufacturing,testing, installing and repairing radioactive sources, and the devicesin which they are used.License No. 22-00057-32G was issued on July 12, 1965, was most recentlyamended on May 5, 1987, and expires on July 31, 1990. This license, issuedpursuant to 10 CFR Part 30 and andSection; 32.51, authorizes the licenseeto distribute Po-210 sources for use in static elimination devices to personsgenerally licensed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 31.5. Theauthorized devices include Model Numbers 902, 902F, and 905-909, inclusive(the 900 series).IIAshland Chemical Company (ACC), Easton, Pennsylvania, uses Po-210 staticelimination devices under the general license provisions of 10 CFR 31.5and thus is a general licensee. ACC's Po-210 devices were manufacturedand distributed by 3M.On January 22, 1988, ACC's radiation safety consultant notified NRC's RegionsI office that he had detected alpha contamination on worker clothing atits electronic chemicals packaging plant in Easton, Pennsylvania. (Theseclothes are worn by ACC employees while working in the ACC plant and arenot worn to and from work.) Contamination was also detected in the plantareas in the vicinity of 3M series 900 high pressure static eliminationair guns, the apparent source of the contamination. ACC uses the series900 static elimination air gun to remove dust particles from packagingbottles. These 3M air guns, which incorporate a radioactive source containingfrom 10 to 40 millicures of Po-210, showed significant levels of alphacontamination. Po-210 decays by emission of a 5.3 MeV alpha particle, hasa physical half-life of 138 days, and, in these sources, is in the formof ceramic microspheres attached to an epoxy backing and overcoated withan epoxy binder.ACC had engaged the services of a radiation safety consultation after oneof its customers inquired about possible alpha contamination in chemicalssupplied by ACC. The customer's representative had visited ACC on January21, 1988, identified the presence of alpha contamination at ACC's Eastonplant, and reported low-level alpha contamination on his person and clothingas a result of his visit to ACC.ACC also uses 3M static elimination air guns at its plants in Columbus,Ohio, Dallas, Texas, and Newark, California. As a result of the findingsat its Easton plant, ACC had these plants surveyed. The Newark and Columbusplants were found not to be contaminated, but the Dallas plant was contaminatedand six of its twelve 3M series 900 static elimination air guns showedevidence of leakage. ACC plans to test ACC employees at its Easton andDallas plants for the presence of Po-210.NRC inspectors arrived at the Easton plant on January 22, 1988, confirmedthe presence of the radioactive contamination, and are assessing the adequacyof ACC's and 3M's responses to this event. The Texas Bureau of RadiationControl was informed of the findings at the Dallas plant and its inspectorswill assess ACC's response to that event.As of January 25, 1988, the root causes of these contamination incidentshave not been identified. These causes could be related to manufacturingdefects, environment and conditions of use, and/or other unknown factors.The devices of concern appear to be Model Nos. 902, 902F, 906, and 908that use compressed air, rather than ambient blown air. The total numberof these static elimination devices being used by general licensees isnot presently known to NRC. The facts demonstrate an immediate potentialfor radiological hazard to personnel working with the static eliminatorsand others present in the area of use. Accordingly, the Commission findsthat the public health, safety, or interest requires this Order to be madeeffective immediately.IIIAccordingly, in view of the foregoing and pursuant to sections 81, 161b,161c, 161i, 161o, and 182 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended,and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.204 and 10 CFR Parts 30, 31,and 32, <T3>It is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that the license numbers22-00057-06 and 22-00057-32G are modified as follows:</T3>A.

The authorizeddevices include Model Numbers 902, 902F, and 905-909, inclusive (the 900series).On January 25, 1988, these licenses were modified by an immediately effectiveOrder.IIAs more fully described in the Order Modifying License, Effective Immediately,dated January 25, 1988, the NRC determined that the use of the above-describedstatic elimination devices has resulted in significant alpha contaminationon worker clothing and in a number of facilities. As of January 25, 1988,the root causes of these contamination incidents had not been identified.These causes could be related to manufacturing defects, environment andconditions of use, and/or other unknown factors.

Included in the list were general licensees whichappear to be manufacturing products or packages for products such as food,beverages, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, medical products and other productswhich are to be consumed by or applied to humans. NRC inspectors reviewingrecords during the week of January 24, 1988 at the 3M Center in St. Paul,Minnesota also determined that there were indications of a number of faileddevices during the previous year, including devices used at facilitieswhich manufacture products for human consumption. Further inspection andinvestigation at general licensee facilities conducted by 3M, NRC and Statepersonnel revealed additional instances of device failure including somelocated at beverage and food processing plants. Because of the large number of general licensees which use the affectedstatic eliminators and the variety of products for which these devicesare used in the manufacturing process, the full dimensions of the potentialradiological risk resulting from device failure cannot be fully establisheduntil further inspections, investigations, analyses and assessment areconducted. However, the failure of such devices at such plants can resultin contamination of products which constitutes a direct pathway for humanexposure. In order to permit the completion of the requisite evaluationsand to avoid possible contamination of products intended for human consumption,we have determined that certain static elimination devices should be recalledby the licensee. On February 5, 1988, the licensee issued a letter to all of its customersusing the specified models of the device, directing such users to removethe devices from applications related to the packaging of food, beverages,pharmaceuticals, or cosmetics and to return them to 3M. The licensee'saction was confirmed to the Commission by letter dated February 5, 1988.We have determined to confirm 3M's action by this Order. IV Accordingly, in view of the foregoing and pursuant to sections 81, 161b,161c, 161i, 161o, and 182 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended,and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.204 and 10 CFR Parts 30, 31,and 32, <T3>It is hereby Ordered, effective immediately, that license numbers 22-00057-06and 22-00057-32G are modified as follows:</T3><ITAG tagnum="21">In accordance with its letter dated February 5, 1988, the licenseeshall inform all users of its Model 902, 902F, 906, and 908 static eliminatorsinvolved in the packaging of food, beverages, pharmaceuticals, and cosmeticsthat it is withdrawing these devices from service and that such devicesare to be returned to the licensee as instructed in the licenesee's noticeto customers dated February 5, 1988.</ITAG>The Director, Office of Nuclear Materials Safety and Safeguards, may relaxor rescind any of the above conditions for good cause shown by the licensee.V Any person other than the licensee adversely affected by this Order mayrequest a hearing within 20 days of the date of this Order.

License No. 22-00057-06 was issuedon February 17, 1964, was most recently amended on May 6, 1987, and expireson May 31, 1992. This license authorizes the Licensee to use a varietyof radionuclides, including polonium-210 (Po-210), and to conduct a varietyof activities with these materials including manufacturing, testing, installing,and repairing radioactive sources, and the devices in which they are used.License No. 22-00057-32G was issued on July 12, 1965, was most recentlyamended on May 5, 1987, and expires on July 31, 1990. The license authorizesthe Licensee to transfer Po-210 sources for use in static elimination devicesto persons generally licensed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR31.5 The authorized devices include, among others, Model Numbers 902, 902F,and 905-909, inclusive (the 900 series).On January 25, 1988, these licenses were modified by an immediately effectiveOrder. These licenses were further modified by an immediately effectiveConfirmatory Order on February 5, 1988.IIAs more fully described in the Order Modifying License, Effective Immediately,dated January 25, 1988, the NRC had determined that the use of the above-describedstatic elimination devices has resulted in significant alpha contaminationon worker clothing and in a number of facilities. As of January 25, 1988,the root cause of these contamination incidents had not been identified.These causes could be related to manufacturing defects, the environmentand conditions of use, and/or other unknown factors. The devices initiallyof concern appeared to be Model Nos. 902, 902F, 906, and 908 which usecompressed air. The total number of these static elimination devices beingused by general licensees was not then known to NRC. The facts then knowndemonstrated an immediate potential for radiological hazards to personnelworking with the static eliminators and others present in the area of use.Accordingly, the Commission found that the public health, safety, or interestrequired that the January 25, 1988 Order be made effective immediately.The Order modified 3M's licenses and, among other things, suspended theauthority to distribute Model Nos. 902, 902F, 906, and 908 polonium-210static elimination devices.As more fully described in the Confirmatory Order Modifying License, EffectiveImmediately, dated February 5, 1988, NRC subsequently learned of multipleinstances of failures of Model Nos. 902, 902F, 906, and 908 devices. Manyof these failures occurred at facilities where general licensees manufactureproducts, or packages for products, such as food, beverages, pharmaceuticals,cosmetics, medical products, and other items which are to be consumed by,or applied to, humans.On February 5, 1988, the Licensee issued a letter to all of its customersusing the specified models of the device, directing such users to removethe devices from applications related to the packaging of food, beverages,pharmaceuticals, or cosmetics and to return them to 3M. The Licensee'saction was confirmed by Order dated February 5, 1988. The February 5, 1988Confirmatory Order modified 3M's license to require 3M to inform all usersof its Model 902, 902F, 906, and 908 static eliminators involved in thepackaging of food, beverages, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics that it iswithdrawing these devices from service and that such devices are to bereturned to the Licensee.IIISubsequent to issuing the February 5, 1988 Confirmatory Order, the staffhas received reports of additional failed devices. Some of the newly reportedfailures are identified by model numbers not specified in the prior Orders.For example, Model No. 907 static elimination devices, which utilize blownrather than compressed air, have been found leaking in at least 3 cases.In addition, bar-type static eliminator devices, specifically Model No.210, have been reported to have leaked. Some of these blown air and bar-typedevices are used in plants that manufacture products and packages, or packagematerials for products, which would constitute a direct pathway for humanexposure if contaminated. At this time, the cause(s) of the failures ofthese devices is not known.On February 8, 1988, 3M submitted a brief report of its work under theOrder of January 25. The staff met with 3M at Region III offices on February11, 1988, to discuss these results and to hear 3M's proposed plan of action.Among other things, 3M senior executives indicated that 3M planned to voluntarilywithdraw all static eliminators (regardless of model number) used in thepackaging of food, beverages, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.In view of the wide use of these devices, the increasing number of faileddevices of various model numbers, the current uncertainty as to the failuremechanisms and the potential for contamination and the consequent exposureof humans, the Commission finds that the public health, safety, and interestrequires that all such devices, regardless of model number, be withdrawnfrom use by general licensees engaged in the production and/or packagingof food, beverages, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics and that such actionbe ordered, effective immediately. IVAccordingly, in view of the foregoing and pursuant to sections 81, 161b,161c, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended,and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.204 and 10 CFR Parts 30 and32, it is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that license numbers 22-00057-06and 22-00057-32G are modified as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">A. 3M is required to inform all users of all models of 3M Po-210 staticeliminators involved in the production or packaging of food, beverages,pharmaceuticals, or cosmetics that it is withdrawing these devices fromservice and that such devices are to be returned to 3M not later than March2, 1988, in accordance with its instructions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. Not later than March 4, 1988, 3M shall submit to the Regional Administrator,Region III, 799 Roosevelt Road, Glen Ellyn, Illinois 60137, a written reportdescribing the extent to which it has complied with this Order and theFebruary 5, 1988 Order. The report shall include the names, addresses,and telephone numbers of all users who were not notified and all userswho have failed to return devices by this date.</ITAG>The Deputy Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards,may relax or rescind any of the above conditions for good cause shown bythe licensee. IVThe Licensee and any other person adversely affected by this Order mayrequest a hearing within 20 days of the date of this Order. Any requestfor a hearing shall be submitted to the Deputy Director of the Office ofNuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC. 20555, with copies to the Assistant General Counsel forEnforcement at the same address, and to the Regional Administrator, RegionIII, 799 Roosevelt Road, Glen Ellyn, Illinois 60137.
