They are automatic watersoftening systems. And water officials estimate that they are responsible forwasting at least a half-million gallons every night in homes throughout theSanta Clara Valley, enough in one night to supply three average families for ayear.;    There are tens of thousands of automatic water softeners being usedthroughout the South Bay: not the little charcoal faucet attachments, but thebig tanks that sit in garages and laundry rooms. Most are in homes. But manyoffices and restaurants also use the devices, which remove calcium, magnesiumand other particles from hard water to make it taste better and to keep itfrom leaving ugly deposits in sinks and tubs.;    But that is a luxury thatofficials at the Santa Clara Valley Water District say they can no longerafford.; &quot;We'll be asking people to turn them off this year,&quot; said Teddy Morseof the Santa Clara Valley Water District. &quot;The water . . . won't taste thesame. But (the softeners) use an awful lot of water.&quot;;    Just how much?Thirty-five to 120 gallons every time the systems need to be flushed. In mosthomes, it's every three days. In some homes, restaurants and offices, it'severy night.;    The request to abandon water softeners comes just when waterwill be tasting its worst because more of it will be pumped from undergroundwells.;    The large amounts of water are used when the softeners &quot;regenerate&quot;-- using a saltwater solution to clean the resin bead filters that collect thebad-tasting particles. This cleaning process is automatic, set by a timer forthe wee hours of the morning, when there is little water demand. Then, the taptypically runs for an hour or more.;    Water mystery;    Just how much waterruns through softeners has caught some people by surprise.;    Two months ago,Dave Mendoza tried to add up how much water he and his wife used each day.They counted the toilet flushes, the showers, the dishwasher, the two weeklyloads of laundry.;    &quot;It didn't add up. Our water bill said we were usinghundreds of gallons more than we thought,&quot; said Mendoza, who lives in SanJose. &quot;Then a neighbor told us it was our water softener.&quot;;    Mendozadiscovered the 7-year-old system used 50 gallons every other day. The Mendozashave since shut it off.;    &quot;The water doesn't taste as good,&quot; he said, &quot;butwe're saving $30 a month on our water bill.&quot;;    Water softener manufacturersare quick to defend their products.;    'Health is more important';  &quot;Peoplelook at it this way: The family's health is more important than the fine forusing too much water,&quot; said Mari Lynn Johnson, manager of Eco Water Servisoftin San Jose, which rents 6,000 softeners and sells about 1,200 each year.&quot;It's not as bad as they make it sound.&quot;;    Water officials and consumeradvocates reply that, while the softeners may improve taste, they aren'tdesigned to remove harmful contaminants.;    &quot;Actually, they send too muchsalt to the sewage treatment plants,&quot; said Pat Ferraro, a water board member.&quot;The salt will eventually become as important an issue as how much water theyuse.&quot; An average water softener uses six pounds of salt each regenerationcycle.;    To keep water-watching customers from turning away from watersofteners, some companies have come up with plans to clean the resin beads atwater plants, so people don't have to use their home water allotments to flushthe purifiers.;    Installs flow restricters;  Johnson said her companyinstalls water flow restricters such as low-flow shower heads to make up forthe water used to clean the systems that it sells.;    &quot;We dread having peopleshut everything off because they are wasting water,&quot; said Pam Workman of RayneWater Conditioning Systems, which has 14,000 customers in the San Jose area.&quot;There are alternatives.&quot;;    In response to the drought, Rayne has developeda water softener that uses only 12 gallons per regeneration flush. But fewother companies have followed suit.;    The Santa Clara Valley Water Districtadvises people with water softeners to shut them off for the duration of thedrought. If they can't stomach the water, the district is requesting thatpeople try to reduce the timing of their softener flushing cycles to once aweek or less.;     THE PROCESS; This is how a water softener works:;(box)Mineral-rich &quot;hard&quot; water flows through a tank filled with resin beads,which remove the minerals and other particles.; (box)The particle-free &quot;soft&quot;water flows directly to outlets in the home or business.; (box)As the resinbeads remove the minerals, they slowly get saturated with &quot;hard&quot; material.They must be cleaned every few days so they can continue to grip ontoparticles. This is done by running saltwater through the resin.; (box)Afterthe saltwater cleanses the beads, it runs down the drain.;  HOW MUCH DO THEYFLUSH?; Here is about how much water selected automatic water softeningsystems use each time they clean the resin filters after 1,000 gallons ofwater have been purified. The frequency of flushing varies with householdwater use but is generally every one to three days.; Type of softener        Minutes water runs    Avg. gallons; Servisoft Comput-a-Save 1230            45              35; Culligan Mark 59 Aqua Sensor            140             45; Sears Kenmore Cycle Miser 34280N         90              50; Marlo MP255                            100              50; Rayne RT2000                           115             120; Source: Santa Clara Valley Water District;Consumer Reports; Mercury News  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LISA LAPIN, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910220  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO; CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  984  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday February 20, 199100051027,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
