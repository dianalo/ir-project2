In a lengthy article, the Communist Party daily reported seriousshortcomings in the country's meat production.   Thursday's article told Soviets what most already knew, that theSoviet Union doesn't produce enough meat to feed its peopleproperly. The story was part of a wider campaign launched since aCommunist Party meeting earlier this summer focusing attention onfood and consumer goods shortages and calling for a crash programto improve supply and distribution.   Pravda cited government statistics as claiming that each Sovietconsumed 141 pounds of meat last year, near the annual level of 154pounds health officials recommend.   It turns out the meat consumption figure for 1987 includes 1.6million tons of animal fat and ``subproducts of a second category''not containing meat, Pravda said. The ``subproducts'' includeheads, legs, ears and tripe. People were eating 13 pounds a year ofthis kind of ``meat,'' Pravda said.   The actual per capita consumption figure was closer to 128pounds, Pravda said, but even that was unevenly distributed aroundthe country.   The method of calculating the figure was drafted during the``years of stagnation,'' the catchwords for the rule of Sovietleader Leonid I. Brezhnev. The statistics were inflated to``convince ourselves how well were were living,'' the newspapersaid.   Under Brezhnev, and even before, government officials overstatedoutput of factories and farms they supervised to qualify forbonuses and give the impression, often false, that they weremeeting government-set plan targets.   The article was part of the campaign for ``glasnost,'' orgreater openness on some issues, encouraged by Soviet leaderMikhail Gorbachev.</TEXT></DOC>
