Officially, the government is forecasting 3.8percent growth this year, while most private economists are predicting 3percent or less.;    The Bank of Japan more than doubled interest rates overthe last two years to cool overheated stock and property markets. Thatcontributed to a wave of bankruptcies, a plunge in the stock market last yearand the wrecking of several multibillion-dollar real estate empires.;    Butin general, Japanese companies seem to have adapted adroitly, Tuesday'sfigures suggest.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Tokyo  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910320  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  266  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday March 20, 199100080086,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
