(Supervideodiscsystem!&quot;andP;  (Smug nod.)andP;  &quot;It's ...andP;  DVI!&quot;andP;  (Shrug, frown.)andP;  * DVI stands fordigital video interactive, and, at minimum, it's a system for bringingfull-screen, full-motion TV pictures and sound to a regular PC.andP;  That's thevideo part.andP;  The D for digital means it's all stored as binary code, whichmakes possible the I for interactive: the potential for the viewer or theproducer to twist, manipulate, and transmogrify every iota of picture andsound.andP;  With DVI, punk fans could turn anyone's hair purple, right there ontheir computer screens.andP;  * What makes DVI work more like TV than the stillimages you're used to seeing on a computer screen is heavy-duty datacompression, a process that's like squishing 120 pounds of video informationinto a one-pound package.andP;  The result is a vidoe version of freeze-driedlasagna; it doesn't take much shelf space (in this case, disc space), butadding back everything that's been squeezed out gives you somethingremarkably like the original.andP;  Julia Child would definitely notice thedifference; Joe Average probably wouldn't.andP;  * The possibilities for training,education, sales, and items such as Picturephones are--well, the word&quot;endless&quot; has been bandied about.andP;  Some jaded computer folks have been heardgasping with amazement at DVI demonstrations.andP;  And the whole system isanything but pie in the sky: the current DVI implementation is a set of threePC AT-bus boards that should be on the market by the middle of next year.andP;  *andO;So DVI's developers may well have the last laugh.andP;  With the right breaks,this fine GE/RCA innovation has a real chance of making the same kind ofimpact as another item largely developed in the David Sarnoff Research Centerin Princetone, New Jersey: the color TV system in use since the Howdy Doodyera.andP;  * The Intel corporation--which produces processors, the guts ofPCs--seems to think so.andP;  The company just bought the technology--lock, stock,and chip set.andP;  But whether DVI will turn into a strutting peacock or aforgotten turkey could depend on something as low-tech as the Mom-and-Popvideo store up the street.andP;  * Art Kaiman, the godfather of the DVI enterpriseand engineering director of the DVI operation, knows all about Mom and Pop.andO;They delivered the coup de grace to the last big project he worked on atRCA--the infamous CED (capacitance electronic disc) videodisc player.andP;  Backin the early 1980s, CED seemed like a great idea to everyone except high-endpurists, who snikered at its low-tech looks (it used a stylus, for Pete'ssake!) and access limitations, which did not exist in the much pricierMCA/Philips LaserDisk system.andP;  Conceived as a relatively low-end product, theCED system offered feature films for about $20--far less than prevailingvideo-cassette prices at the time.andM;On paper, CED looked great.andP;  Kaiman put even sexier features into developmentand, as he says, brought in the &quot;weirdos&quot;--programmers and designers whocould develop interactive applications of the sorth then being pioneered onLaserDisks.andM;Larry Ryan, manager of video processor architecture (Kaiman calls him &quot;thefather of DVI&quot;), noticed that CED discs could be used to store digital data.andO;The idea seemed to mesh perfectly with the CED interactive, projects, as wellas with a home computer RCA had on the drawing board.andP;  The problem was that aCED disc couldn't store enough digital data, or retrieve it fast enough, toproduce full-motion, full-screen video.andM;To digitize standard TV-quality video, you need about 600KB of data to storeeach thirtieth-of-a-second frame; a CED player could retrieve only about 15KBper frame--about one-fortieth of what was needed.andP;  If Ryan's scheme was towork, compressing the data would be the only solution.andP;  But retrieving itfast enough to produce onscreen moving pictures would be a realproblem--40-to-1 video decompression on the fly was utterly unheard of.andM;But m ost compression schemes are symmetrical; decompression simply reversesthe compression process and takes about the same amount of time.andP;  Ryanfocused on asymmetrical compression--spending far more time squeezing thanunsqueezing.andP;  With asymmetrical compression, RCA could use all the fancy,complicated algorithms and big, fast computers it needed to analyzesuccessive frames and crunch them down to size, provided it had the hardwareto instantly and imperceptibly bring the whole thing back to life on theviewer's TV screen.andM;Are You Sitting Down?andM;Kaiman and Ryan got excited enough about the CED idea to develop a simulationto prove its feasibility.andP;  But in 1984 Kaiman answered his phone and heard aquestion he remembered from a decade before, when RCA abandoned its ill-fatedattempt to get into the mainframe computer business.andP;  The question was, &quot;Areyou sitting down?&quot;andM;RCA was abadoning the videodisc business.andP;  The videocassette market hadburgeoned.andP;  Nobody cared how little a feature film might cost in anotherformat.andP;  Since VCRs let you record, you needn't buy films at all--you couldsimply tape them off the air.andP;  And if you wanted recent movies, you could goout and rent them, a new idea RCA's marketers somehow never considred.andO;Hello, Mom and Pop's Videorama.andP;  Goodbye, CED discs.andM;According to Kaiman, RCA immediately lost all interest in digital video.andP;  Butjust as things looked bleakest, along came CD-ROM--standard compact discs,just like audio CDs, but used to store digital data for computers.andP;  Theformat was much like the one Ryan and Kaiman envisioned for CED.andP;  Thedifference was that CD-ROM was clearly on its way to becoming an industrystandard.andM;There was one minor problem.andP;  CD-ROM transmitted data at just 5KB per frame,which produced the equivalent of one full picture every four seconds.andP;  Talkabout super slow motion!andP;  Full-motion video from these babies would require acompression/decompression formula three times as powerful as the CED scheme.andM;Ryan decided to go with delta compression: since each frame of video tends todiffer only slightly from the previous one, keeping track of just theimage-to-image changes requires far less information than recording eachentire frame.andP;  Essentially, a delta compression algorithm says, &quot;Make thisframe exactly like the last one, except for this new part over here,&quot; therebysaving oodles of storage.andM;But virtually every level of the RCA hierarchy rebuffed the idea.andP;  The commonwisdom at RCA, as Kaiman describes it, was, &quot;Why don't we spend money onsomething useful?&quot;andM;Deal with the DevilandM;To keep the project alive, Kaiman says he finally &quot;made a deal with thedevil.&quot;andP;  He promised the powers at RCA that he would deliver a prototypedecompression chip set by the end of 1986, nine months away.andP;  Using SiliconCompiler Tools to design VLSI (very large-scale integration) CMOS(complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) chips, the team met the deadline.andO;The first chips off the line worked fine, Kaiman proudly recalls.andM;To maintain publicity momentum, he made another fiendish pact: even beforethe chips were ready, he agreed to demonstrate DVI at Microsoft's March 1987CD-ROM conference.andP;  The first hardware that incorporated the chips becameavailable near the end of January.andP;  Two weeks before the conference, the teamcut its first demo disc.andM;But in rehearsals the evening before the demonstration, 30 system crashesconvinced Kaiman to say, &quot;That's it.andP;  Let's forget it.&quot;andP;  He retired to hishotel room in despair, but team member Mike Keith stayed up all night workingon the problem.andP;  Keith couldn't keep the system from dying, but he rigged itso that when it did crash, it could be brought back to life instantly.andM;A packed house of CD-ROM industry insiders watched as Kaiman anxiously beganthe first public demonstration of DVI using a projection-TV screen.andO;Airplanes zoomed overhead in full-color, full-size, full-motion video; aMozart divertimento issued from the speakers in high-fidelity sound;interactive applications displayed dazzling synthetic images.andP;  Behind thescenes, Kaiman watched in horror as the system went down--then in amazementas it came back up again so fast that the audience never caught on.andP;  Momentslater, the crowd gave Kaiman and his team a standing ovation.andM;Singular SensationandM;DVI became the sensation of the conference.andP;  True, the adorable baby penguinsin the DVI demo looked a little fuzzier than they should have, and some ofthe colors looked a bit smeary and weak.andP;  But industry pundits were amazedthat the full-screen, full-motion feat could be performed at all, givenCD-ROM's narrow bandwidth.andP;  Later, at crowded demos in the exhibit hall,skeptical wire-checkers assured themselves that the system was actuallyrunning on tall &quot;tower&quot; boards that rose vertically from an open IBM PC ATframe.andM;This real-life DVI looked a whole lot better than what was then theindustry's hottest specification: compact disc-interactive (CD-I), beingdeveloped by Sony and the North American division of N.V.andP;  Philips, a Dutchcompany.andP;  (See the article on CD-I following this one.)andP;  DVI wasdemonstrating more than CD-I was promising.andP;  Philips's beefy Dutch burgherswandered through the halls of the conference, looking as though they'd justannounced an exciting new transcontinental prop plane--moments before Boeingroared overhead with the first test flight of its 707.andP;  Speculation that CD-Iwas dead ran rampant.andM;Two of the hottest DVI demonstrations made the salient point that CD-ROMdevelopers could use the DVI system to build applications around alreadyexisting video--unlikely at best with the limited video range of CD-I, whichcan't handle full-screen, TV-quality video.andP;  The DVI application, Words inthe Neighborhood, developed with the Children's Television Workshop, usedoff-the-shelf &quot;Sesame Street&quot; footage to minimize the cost of producing aninteractive alphabet program.andP;  Palenque, developed with the Bank StreetCollege of Education, took the PBS series &quot;Voyage of the Mimi&quot; as a point ofdeparture and pulled out all the stops: point to the photographic icon of aboy, and he talks to you.andP;  Twist the joystick, and a digitally processedfish-eye photograph lets you look in any direction.andP;  Push or pull thejoystick, and you can walk up to a Mayan temple.andM;Another application, Design and Decorate, developed with VideodiscPublishing, Inc., showed off DVI's digital manipulation techniques.andP;  Using3-D models and photographic textures, it lets users move furniture around afloor plan, cover it with various fabrics, lay carpet on the floor, try outvarious types of wallpaper, and see the results in perspective views.andP;  Theproduct is now in commercial development.andM;Other models included a golf game using the 360-degree look-around feature; aclever photography simulator, with which users can frame images on the screenand compare their results with the way professionals would do it; and alandscaping program similar to Design and Decorate.andM;Still, there were a couple of catches.andP;  The decompression chips ran fine--ata blazing 12.5 mips (million instructions per second), about four times asfast as an 80386 processor--but back home, the compression and analysisalgorithms weren't exactly swift.andP;  Crunching a single frame took about threeminutes of expensive time on a DEC VAX 8800 computer.andP;  And the picturequality could stand some improvement.andM;And Kaiman had his hands full with bureaucracy.andP;  RCA had been sold to GE,forcing him to &quot;sell the idea to a whole new set of bosses.&quot; And, though thetechnology and the team remained in GE's hands, the Sarnoff labs, wherevirtually all the work was developed, were donated to SRI International.andO;After the initial flurry of excitement, DVI seemed to disappear from thepublic eye for a year, except for persistent industry scuttlebutt that GE wasabout to spin it off into a joint venture.andM;Wait!andP;  There's More!andM;As the 1988 CD-ROM conference made clear, DVI hadn't really disappeared.andO;Hitachi, NEC, and Olivetti announced their interest in the technology, whichhad moved forward considerably.andP;  Representatives of Lotus, Intel, andMicrosoft got up on stage to voice support for DVI as an industry standard,and in October 1988, Intel put its money where its mouth was, announcing itspurchase of the entire DVI operation--everything from the technology to theteam.andM;The dazzler for 1988 was real-time compression of both still and full-motiondigital video.andP;  Full-motion &quot;edit-level&quot; video looked a little jerky; it usedabout 10 frames per second instead of the usual 30 in full-motion video.andP;  Itwas enough to elicit more gasps, since it was intended primarily as a toolfor developers.andP;  By using a special Meiko parallel processor, it compressedvideo images 60 times as fast as the old DEC VAX method.andM;The DVI team also emphasized the almost-forgotten fact that the microcode forthe DVI chip set is programmable and can be changed in less time than ittakes to display two scan lines of a TV picture.andP;  This means that producerscan develop dazzling special effects in software, slip them into the chip,and use them to call up new forms of wonderment, all in a single frame.andP;  Anew DVI demo, using a mouse, let users control a still photograph'sbrightness, contrast, and tint, as well as special filters and a mosaiceffect.andM;The 1988 conference also marked Philips's first public demonstration of CD-I,which was slick but hardly earthshaking.andP;  One problem was the fourth-ratequality of the TV effects; a fuzzy Olivia Newton-John video, cleverly stuckinto a frame that covered only about one-quarter of the screen, was no matchfor DVI.andP;  There was no standing ovation.andP;  Philips's prototype black-boxsystem, later displayed in the exhibit hall, drew little attention.andM;Where Now?andM;CD-I is a consumer product--a box that plugs into your TV and stereo andplays CDs of all stripes, including new ones specially made for the CD-Iformat.andP;  DVI, on the other hand, is a computer product.andP;  There's nothing thatsays somebody can't put it in a standalone box--in theory, CD-I makers couldput it in their boxes.andP;  But DVI's possibilities are more promising thanCD-I's.andM;The beta sites for DVI are pretty good indications of where initialapplications will be.andP;  Training, the major use thus far for currentlaserdisc-cum-computer-interactive-video, is one clear emphasis: beta DVIsystems have gone to industrial and military training companies and to anaeroscope firm.andP;  DVI's ability to mix &quot;synthetic video&quot; (including realistic3-D textures) with photographic video (including high-resolution still photosor maps) clearly offers possibilities for training simulations.andM;Beta systems at ad agencies suggest that interactive, point-of-purchaseadvertising will be another obvious priority.andP;  An interactive presentationmeans you can make sure your message gets across by letting the customercommunicate with the demo.andP;  (Want a coupon?andP;  First, just take this simpleKrunchies Kwiz!)andM;With initial DVI prices forecast at about $7,000 for an AT-compatible boardset that basically gives you only playback capability, and perhaps $25,000for a full applications-development system that includes boards, systemsoftware, authoring tools, and support, DVI is obviously aimed at thecorporate market.andP;  But Kaiman intends to license every aspect of DVIaggressively--except for the highly proprietary compression-algorithm sourcecode and chip internals.andP;  Smaller and cheaper versions of the chip set shouldbe available to manufacturers at prices that the DVI folks hope will enablemanufacturers to offer products in the $1,000 range by the end of 1990.andP;  Aplug-in DVI board for computers would probably cost even less than $1,000,and such a low price could help DVI get integrated into the PC world in ahurry.andM;Where Later?andM;At the 1988 CD-ROM conference, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates discoursed at lengthon the growing need for compression of video, audio, and text.andP;  He then wenton to predict that by Christmas 1991, a $1,000 PC will include a built-inCD-ROM player.andP;  Tandy claims (to much scoffing) that its erasable CDtechnology will be available by late 1989; others are working on similarproducts.andP;  It's not hard to see how DVI might fit into these scenarios.andM;This potential is not lost on applications developers.andP;  Rob Lippincott,director of market development for Lotus's information services group, notesthe industry's rapid movement to adopt GUI (pronounced &quot;gooey&quot;): thegraphical user interface seen on the Macintosh and increasingly on PCs.andP;  Butultimately, he suggests, what people may really want is VUI (or &quot;vooey&quot;): aradio user interface.andM;Before you say &quot;phooey,&quot; consider VUI: you boot your machine, and a friendlyface welcomes you.andP;  Need help later on?andP;  Click the help menu and thatpersonal guide comes to your rescue, perhaps via a disembodied voice thattalks you through what you're doing so that you don't waste any preciousscreen space.andM;Even if CD-ROM turns out to be a bust, DVI may remain on its feet.andP;  Rarelymentioned is the fact that DVI is totally independent of microprocessors andstorage devices.andP;  Although the current platform is based on Intel chips andCD-ROM, there's no reason why DVI technology can't hook onto a Motorola chipor any other that takes off.andP;  If DAT (digital audio tape) or a subsequenttechnology somehow eats CD-ROM's lunch, DVI can latch onto it.andP;  And there'sno good reason why DVI might not find itself in, say, a Picturephone system;if you're willing to sacrifice resolution or frame count (and have a reallybig phone to hold all the necessary hardware), this type of system is more orless ready now.andM;Even in its current CD-ROM incarnation, DVI offers plenty of options.andP;  Ifyou're willing to cut down on the amount of video on a disc, you can addhours and hours of audio.andP;  If you're willing to give up resolution or putyour picture in a quarter-screen frame, you can add more video orhigh-resolution stills.andP;  All sorts of odd packages are possible.andM;Can DVI fail?andP;  Of course.andP;  Picture quality--and the production values of thedemos--are still not quite up to broadcast-TV level.andP;  Not all the softwaretools are in place, though they should be by the time the beta phase ends.andO;And even with the tools ready to roll, developing interactive applicationswill cost anywhere from $100,000 to Heaven's gate.andP;  On the other hand, DVI isstill the only CD format that can easily take advantage of the millions offeet of film and video footage already in the can--everything from The GreatTrain Robbery to Prince's latest MTV epic.andP;  And the fact that a company asrespected for its technology as Intel is now running the show makes theenterprise far more stable.andM;Some unforeseen high-tech product in the wings (such as CD-I), or somelow-tech mom-and-pop principle nobody has noticed, might sneak in and catchDVI unawares.andP;  But Kaiman and the DVI crew are bound and determined to makethis one fly.andP;  They've heard the question &quot;Are you sitting down?&quot; once toooften.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
