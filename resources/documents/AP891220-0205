(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A regional humane society isinvestigating charges that a county dog pound has been buryingalive unwanted dogs and cats, officials said Wednesday.   A number of people reported seeing animals squirming in the backof a pickup that was taking animals to a landfill for burial.However, Franklin County officials are denying that the animals,which were supposed to have been killed by carbon monoxidepoisoning, were alive when buried.   Debbie Allen, who works at the landfill office, said she wasworking Tuesday when a truck filled with animals in plastic bagsfrom the Franklin County Dog Pound pulled up.   ``I saw movement in the back of the truck,'' Ms. Allen said.``At first I thought it was the wind, but then I noticed it made ateepee effect, like a paw reaching up.''   The driver, who was outside the truck to obtain papers from Ms.Allen's office, ``swatted the bag with the back of his hand,'' Ms.Allen said. ``Then he pulled up two other trash bags as if he wastrying to cover it up.''   Franklin County Board member Cliff Cockrum said the animals werechecked before they left the pound in Benton. The board overseesthe pound.   ``When we destroyed animals yesterday (Tuesday) morning we had aveterinarian to check each and every animal and he assured us thateach one was dead before they left the pound,'' Cockrum said.   Billy Hammond Sr. of Benton said he and his two sons examinedfour dogs they found at the landfill.   ``One of them my boy picked up and it gave out a pitiful whineand then it went limp in his arms,'' he said Wednesday. The otherthree animals were warm and limp and appeared to have been deadonly minutes, Hammond said.   Cockrum called the reports by Ms. Allen and Hammond hearsay.   About 45 animals are destroyed every two weeks at the pound.They are put in steel boxes linked to the exhaust pipe of a vehicleand are asphyxiated with carbon monoxide, Cockrum said.   The carcasses are dumped at the landfill within two hours ofdeath, including the 45-minute ride from Benton to Carbondale.Cockrum said 28 animals were killed Tuesday, including eight ornine cats.   Hammond said he found another dog barely alive in October andasked the state Department of Agriculture to perform an autopsy onthe dog. Dr. D.K. Mann confirmed that he performed the procedure atthe department's Animal Disease Laboratory in Centralia.   The autopsy found that the dog had been alive about three hoursafter it was buried, Hammond said. It also found that the animal'sorgans were severely burned from inhaling carbon monoxide, Hammondsaid.   Frantz Dantzler, regional director for the Humane Society of theUnited States, said asphyxiation with carbon monoxide is an``extremely painful'' method of euthanasia. The most humane andleast painful method is lethal injection of barbiturates, he said.   Dantzler said his offers to the county for help in finding amore humane euthansia system were ignored.   The society plans to investigate the matter further, Dantzlersaid in a telephone interview from his home in South Bend, Ind.</TEXT></DOC>
