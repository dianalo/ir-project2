Other witnesses told how communities have been devastated by plant closings following takeovers and how company pension funds have been tapped by raiders.    At yesterday's hearing, the labor leaders appeared to be talking to the converted. &quot;The corporate takeover rage is lining the pockets of stock arbitragers and emptying those of American workers,&quot; said Sen. John Heinz (R., Pa.). &quot;We must consider the effect of these megamergers on local economies.&quot; Sen. Richard Shelby (D., Ala.) warned that a recession would force many companies, laden with debt from the financing of acquisitions and buyouts, to lay off thousands of workers.    Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) said he plans to introduce a comprehensive bill concerning takeovers within three weeks and take it to the Senate floor by the end of May.    In a breakfast speech yesterday to the National Association of Manufacturers, Sen. Proxmire called on business leaders and lobbyists to mobilize grass-roots political support for stretching out the tender-offer process and curbing takeover abuses. Otherwise, he warned, lobbyists for Wall Street's investment banking houses could succeed in thwarting measures that would scuttle their &quot;money-making machine.&quot;    In appealing for a telephone and letter-writing blitz to win over Congress, Mr. Proxmire disclosed new details about his bill. He said he favors requiring investors to notify the Securities and Exchange Commission of their intentions to acquire 3% or more of a company's stock before they actually buy the stock. Currently, bidders are required to file disclosure reports with the SEC within 10 days of buying a stake of 5% or more.    Such a pre-notification rule, recently recommended by the Securities Industry Association, would put investors on even footing with arbitragers and other stock speculators, Mr. Proxmire said. It also would stop &quot;sneak attacks&quot; by raiders who use the 10-day period to amass stock secretly. Another provision in his bill would empower investors to sue for damages against those who violate the reporting requirements.    Mr. Proxmire also said that he would require raiders to line up 100% of their financing before they make bids. Moreover, no more than half of their financing could be raised through bank loans or the issuance of high-risk, high-yield &quot;junk bonds,&quot; he added.    The National Association of Manufacturers, among other things, favors lowering the 5% reporting threshold to 1% and closing the 10-day window on reporting 5% stakes to two days. It also recommends levying fines for delinquent or false 13D reports, which notify the SEC of 5% stakes held in companies, and extending the minimum period for tender offers to shareholders to 60 business days from the current 20. Yesterday, Mr. Proxmire said such an extension seemed &quot;reasonable.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
