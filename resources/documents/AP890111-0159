Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said that under his 10-year plan, fundsfor the Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly known as Star Wars;the Trident, MX and Midgetman missiles; and the B-52, B-1B and B-2stealth bomber would be placed in a ``strategic pot.''   The annual budget for the pot would remain constant at about $31billion _ the total budget for the strategic programs in 1989 _ withadjustments for inflation, Aspin said.   The $31 billion budget would be available for all strategicweapons, with none of it earmarked for any specific weapon, he said.   The program would force Congress and the new administration todecide what specific weapon systems in the pot should be purchasedand deployed and which should be delayed.   ``It allows you to make those kind of rational tradeoffs and thenalso to make the political tradeoffs,'' Aspin told a National PressClub audience. ``The fact of the matter is you've got constituenciesfor these weapon systems and you've got to finally decide whatyou're going to do with them.''   For example, Aspin mentioned continuing research and developmentfunding for the truck-mobile, single-warhead Midgetman missile,which many Democrats in Congress favor but the Reagan administrationproposed scrapping.   To compensate for moving forward on the Midgetman, Aspinsuggested slowing down stealth bomber purchases for two years andlimiting spending on Star Wars to its current annual level of $4billion through 1996.   Aspin also suggested retiring the Poseidon ballistic missilesubmarines and the oldest B-52s and using the money saved onoperating costs for the two programs for earlier deployment of therail-mobile version of the MX intercontinental ballistic missile,the stealth bomber, or Star Wars.   The committee chairman said the time has come for ``Democrats andRepublicans, White House and Congress, to put all the weapon systemsinto the pot, take a long, 10-year view, work the trade-offs andbuild a strategic consensus.''</TEXT></DOC>
