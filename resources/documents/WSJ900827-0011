Moreover, a Resolution Trust Corp. official, who asked notto be identified, said the thrift-bailout agency is likely tosue at least some of the attorneys connected with thecollapse of Lincoln, which is expected to cost taxpayers morethan $2 billion.</LP><TEXT>   Possible targets include the New York law firm of Kaye,Scholer, Fierman, Hays andamp; Handler, which represented Lincolnin a number of dealings with regulators and whose aggressivetactics have been widely noted.   Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of ThriftSupervision, said the OTS plans to make enforcement actionsagainst lawyers -- and other professionals, such asaccountants, hired by thrifts -- a high priority in comingmonths. Asked about the decision by federal Judge StanleySporkin, which blamed lawyers for contributing to the Lincolndebacle, Mr. Ryan said: &quot;I agree with Judge Sporkin's viewand it's a view I hope you'll see reflected soon inenforcement actions.&quot;   Harris Weinstein, OTS chief counsel, said the office plansto use new powers granted in last year's thrift-bailout lawagainst attorneys and accountants. The law gave the OTS thepower in administrative actions to bar the professionals fromrepresenting clients before regulators, bar them fromrepresenting any federally insured institution, and imposefines. However, the regulators believe these enforcementpowers don't apply to actions that occurred prior to when thethrift law was passed and thus can't be used in the Lincolncase. However, regulators can bring civil suits against thelawyers and accountants who worked for Lincoln.   Judge Sporkin, who in his decision lashed out at CharlesKeating for &quot;looting&quot; Lincoln, raised questions about thescores of accountants and lawyers hired by Mr. Keating. &quot;Whatis difficult to understand,&quot; Judge Sporkin wrote, &quot;is thatwith all the professional talent involved . . . why at leastone professional would not have blown the whistle.&quot;   Though Judge Sporkin found no indication that lawyers hadconspired with Mr. Keating's &quot;illicit activities&quot; he said theattorneys should have been more attentive to the &quot;publicinterest.&quot; He expressed astonishment that lawyers andaccountants signed off on complicated business deals that,the judge said, had no &quot;economic substance.&quot;   The judge's high dudgeon was all the more notable becausethe case had little to do with the actions of lawyers. Theruling dismissed a suit brought by Mr. Keating contendingthat regulators illegally seized Lincoln in April 1989.   Judge Sporkin didn't name specific lawyers or firms in hisdecision, and most of the transactions he criticized wereapparently handled by in-house lawyers for Lincoln and itsparent, American Continental Corp. But Kaye Scholer wasresponsible for at least one of the actions he assailed.   Judge Sporkin termed &quot;unacceptable&quot; a letter from KayeScholer partner Peter Fishbein demanding that federalexaminers in Phoenix, Ariz., route their document requeststhrough Kaye Scholer in New York. Mr. Weinstein of the OTSsaid that the lawyers assisted Lincoln in an &quot;improper effortto defeat the examination process.&quot;   &quot;That's what the client asked us to do,&quot; answers KayeScholer spokesman Stanley Robinson, a partner with the firm.Mr. Robinson said that a compromise was reached in which aKaye Scholer associate worked with the examiners in Phoenix.   Judge Sporkin accused Lincoln attorneys of writing&quot;menacing letters&quot; and preparing &quot;ill-founded lawsuits&quot; thatimpeded government action. Mr. Robinson said he didn't knowwhat Judge Sporkin was referring to in these remarks, butconceded that the latter might be a reference to a lawsuit,prepared by Kaye Scholer, asserting that the regulatorsleaked information. The lawsuit has since been dropped.   &quot;As far as Kaye Scholar is concerned, we are satisfiedthat there was no impropriety in anything we did for Lincolnor American Continental Corp.,&quot; Mr. Robinson said.</TEXT></DOC>
