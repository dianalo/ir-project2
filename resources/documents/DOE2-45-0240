Constitution: For those portions of pipesrequring shieldings, cylindrical vessels surrounding the portions aredisposed and connected to a mercury supply system, a mercury dischargesystem and a freezing system for solidifying mercury. After chargingmercury in a tank by way of a supply hose to the cylindrical vessels,the temperature of the mercury is lowered below the freezing point thereofto solidify the mercury while circulating cooling medium, to therebyform dense cylindrical radioactive-ray shielding walls. The specificgravity of mercury is greater than that of lead and, accordingly, thethickness of the shielding walls can be reduced as compared with theconventional wall thickness of the entire laminates.
