The method uses continuous micro flow sample partial digestion,reduction and extraction in small bore tubes at low flow rates of reagents.Tin(II) chloride in sodium hydroxide solution was used as a reducingreagent. A mixed solution of potassium peroxodisulphate and copper(II)ion was used as oxidizing and catalytic reagent, respectively. The methodwas successfully applied to the completely continuous monitoring of totalmercury in both wastewater and saline water without a heating digestionbath.</TEXT></DOC>
