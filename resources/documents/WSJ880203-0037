William Seidman, FDIC chairman, said the agency ran a $50 million surplus for last year, keeping its insurance fund's net worth at $18.2 billion. Previously, he had speculated that the fund might incur a loss for 1987 for the first time.    Last year, the FDIC handled 184 bank failures and provided financial aid to 19 banks in danger of failing. Mr. Seidman said the reserve for First City Bancorp. is the most the FDIC believes it may have to spend to aid the bank's takeover by an investment group headed by former Chicago banker A. Robert Abboud. The transaction, currently awaiting shareholder approval, would be the second most costly for the FDIC.    Mr. Seidman said he expects bank failures this year to about match those of last year, in number and size. But, he added: &quot;That could change.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
