(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker, forced to quit hismultimillion-dollar television ministry after admitting a sexualencounter with a church secretary, was indicted Monday along withthree former aides on charges of fraud and tax evasion.   A federal grand jury charged Bakker, 48, and former aide RichardDortch, 57, in a 24-count indictment with mail fraud, wire fraud andconspiring to defraud the public through the sale of lifetimepartnerships in the ministry's Heritage Village theme park in FortMill, S.C., south of Charlotte.   If convicted, they could face up to five years in prison and$250,000 fines on each count.   Bakker's wife, Tammy, also a target of the grand jury, was notindicted.   A second, 11-count indictment charged David Taggart and hisbrother, James, with tax evasion and conspiracy to impede theInternal Revenue Service in the collection of taxes. David Taggartis former PTL vice president and special assistant to Bakker; Jamesis a former interior designer for PTL.   U.S. Attorney Thomas Ashcraft declined to comment or say whetherother indictments were possible. ``There has already been too muchpublicity on this already and we don't want any more,'' he said.   The defendants were ordered to appear in federal court Dec. 15.   At Jim and Tammy Ministries, the Bakkers' new organization'soffices south of Charlotte, Bakker's attorneys Jim Toms and RyanHovis said Bakker was trying to deal with the indictments and wouldnot have a statement for several days.   ``Certainly there's a degree of discouragement or regret thatcriminal charges were brought against Mr. Bakker,'' Toms said. ``Buthe's glad to know what he's facing, so he can prepare his defense.''   Hovis added, ``We've been fishing in a muddy pond up till now. Itlooks now like the water's clearing up.''   Dortch told reporters in Clearwater, Fla., where he runs aministry called Life Challenges, that he looked forward to beingable ``to tell my side of the story and to put this matter behindme.'' He asked from prayers from ``all of my brothers and sisters inthe Christian community and in the religious community.''   The Bakkers founded their ministry as Trinity Broadcasting in1972. Through the show ``The PTL Club,'' which combined a talk-showformat with a folksy message of salvation, Bakker became one of thecountry's most popular television evangelists and the head of amultimillion-dollar organization.   But he resigned from PTL in March 1987 after admitting money waspaid to buy the silence of former church secretary Jessica Hahnabout a 1980 sexual encounter in a Florida motel room. The paymenttotaled $363,700 in ministry money.   He admitted the tryst with Ms. Hahn but denied her charge thatshe was an unwilling participant, as well as other charges thatquickly surfaced including financial mismanagement and homosexualencounters.   Bakker's Pentecostal denomination, the Assemblies of God,dismissed him and Dortch in May 1987, and in June, PTL filed forprotection under federal bankruptcy laws.   Ms. Hahn was one of the first witnesses called to testify beforethe grand jury, which began work in August 1987. Former ministryofficials, PTL board members and PTL employees also testified behindclosed doors before the panel.   Monday's indictment alleged Bakker and Dortch diverted PTL fundsfor their own use. Bakker and his wife were given bonuses totalingnearly $3.5 million and Dortch obtained bonuses totaling $550,000,the indictment said.   The indictment also accused Dortch of authorizing a payment of$265,000 to Ms. Hahn, saying that he asked a contractor to supplythe funds. The contractor, Roe Messner, was instructed to get hismoney back by overbilling PTL by the same amount by inflatingconstruction costs on a PTL project, the indictment said.   Messner, who was PTL's chief builder under Bakker, was one ofseveral targets of the grand jury investigation. But he was notcharged in Monday's indictments.   Ms. Hahn, who currently works for a radio station in Phoenix,Ariz., said Monday that she had known that indictments were plannedfor more than a year. She predicted that Bakker would be convicted.   She told a news confrence that she is willing to testify incourt, but other than that wants nothing to do with the story.``This is where it ends for me,'' she said. ``I have lived with thisfor eight years. ... I refuse to be a slave to this any longer.''   The indictment charged that in 1984, Bakker announced the sale oflifetime memberships for the purpose of financing construction of alarge hotel at Heritage USA. More than 152,000 fully paidpartnerships were sold producing at least $158 million in revenue,the indictment said.   The indictment alleged that Bakker and Dortch made falsestatements to induce people to buy partnerships and that the partnerfunds weren't used to construct the lodging facilities that werepromised.   At the same time, Bakker and Dortch were concealing the truefinancial condition of PTL from the ministry's board of directors,the indictment said.   The Taggarts were accused of diverting $1.1 million in PTL fundsto pay personal bills and expenses while failing to report the fundsas income on their 1983 through 1987 tax returns.   For those years, according to the indictment, David Taggartevaded some $320,000 in taxes while James Taggart evaded taxesamounting to some $175,000.   While the grand jury met over the last 15 months, prosecutorscalled dozens of witnesses and subpoenaed thousands of documents tohelp them learn how the ministry under Bakker's leadership from 1980to 1987.   Some of the records indicate the grand jury focused on the lavishlifestyles of the Bakkers and others. Records of travel andentertainment expenses, credit card charges and advances were amongthe thousands of documents subpoenaed.   In a separate action, the Bakkers were ordered by a federalbankruptcy judge last month to repay PTL $6.6 million as restitutionfor excessive pay and benefits they received from the TV ministrybetween 1984 and 1987. David Taggart was ordered to repay about $1.1million.   That ruling by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds was the firsttime any court had ruled that Bakker or any other PTL leaders hadused PTL donors' money improperly. Bakker's attorneys have said theywill appeal.   Meanwhile, the fate of the ministry just across the SouthCarolina border in tiny Fort Mill remains on hold.   Since May, a variety of suitors _ including Bakker _ have triedto buy the 1,700 acres of undeveloped property, the satellitetelevision network and Heritage USA theme park.   Reynolds, who has overseen the bankruptcy proceedings, hasscheduled an auction Dec. 12, after earlier rejecting prior bids.Proceeds will go to satisfy the ministry's debts, which could exceed$130 million.   At one time, Bakker claimed to have the financing to buy theministry back himself for $172 million. But the deal fell throughwhen Bakker was unable to secure a $3 million down payment.</TEXT></DOC>
