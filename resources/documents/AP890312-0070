The Socialists and Communists, who had squabbled for months overthe formation of joint lists of candidates, lost some of theirsupport to the greens, as the Ecologist Party is known.   The traditional right and center-right parties, the Rally for theRepublic and Union for French Democracy, suffered in some areas atthe hands of the extreme-right National Front.   Turnout was estimated at between 70-73.5 percent _ the lowest formunicipal elections since the end of World War II. Turnout in thelast municipal elections in 1983 was 78.4 percent.   In municipalities where no list won an absolute majority a secondround of voting will be held next Sunday. That balloting willinclude all lists that received at least 10 percent of the firstvote.   With about 70 percent of the vote reported Sunday night, theecologists, never previously a force in France, were expected to winbetween 4 and 5 percent of the vote nationally and more in someareas, such as 12.8 percent in Strasbourg and 14 percent in St.Brieuc.   In Lille in northern France, where the mayor is Pierre Mauroy,head of the nation's governing Socialist Party, the greens won 8.4percent.   Antoine Waechter, head of the ecologists, said his party was``demonstrating that they are a political force that is implantingitself here as they are in other European countries.   ``Public opinion is becoming aware of the gravity of theecological crisis and the absence of will by successive governments,no matter what their political color, to deal with it.''   Jean-Marie Le Pen, the National Front leader who won 14.4 percentof the vote in the first round of the presidential election lastspring, praised what he called his party's ``remarkable success.''   ``The National Front has created the only novelty of thiselection because in 1983 it counted only 0.11 percent of the vote... today it could be credited with 7 percent on the nationallevel,'' Le Pen said.   ``When you take into account that we did not present candidatesin all cities ... that's a remarkable success.''   Municipal elections generally are fought on local issues but theresults can provide a sense of the national power of the parties.Few significant changes were noted in Sunday's voting.   Socialist Premier Michel Rocard said the vote confirmed ``thegreat choices that the president and the government have proposed tothe country.''   Marcel Debarge, a national secretary of President FrancoisMitterrand's Socialist Party, said there was ``an unspectacular gainby the left, a certain loss by the traditional right and a strongerthan expected resistance by the National Front, which I regret.''   Charles Pasqua, a leading figure in the conservative Rally forthe Republic, said his party would make no deals with the NationalFront in the runoff elections.Le Pen called that attitude ``the roadto suicide.''   Voting took place in 36,757 communities.   In France's three largest cities, Paris, Marseille and Lyon,there appeared to be no big shakeups.   Conservative Mayor Jacques Chirac was in no danger of losingcontrol of Paris, though it appeared he would not sweep all 20 ofthe city's districts as he did six years ago.   Warfare in Marseille between two Socialist lists, one officialand the other unofficial, did not appear to benefit the right.   In Lyon, conservative former Trade Minister Michel Noir wasvirtually assured of ousting center-right Mayor Francisque Collomb.   Disgruntled with a Socialist-Communist government, the Frenchused the 1983 municipal elections to protest, allowing the right totake over many city halls previously held by the left.   This time, with Mitterrand and Rocard still riding comfortablyhigh in the popularity polls, there seemed to be less of a protestvote.   The Socialist and Communist parties agreed to run joint lists ofcandidates in only about 60 percent of towns with more than 20,000residents. Conservative and centrist candidates shared a slate ofcandidates in about 95 percent of those towns.</TEXT></DOC>
