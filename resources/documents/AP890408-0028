Gen.Prosper Avril.   Western diplomats said the Presidential Guard attackedDessalines Barracks, where the rebel soldiers were dug in. Therewere unconfirmed reports the elite Leopards unit, also in rebellionagainst Avril, had abandoned their base in the suburbs without afight when they realized all was lost.   A government source close to Avril, in power for six stormymonths, said early Saturday that ``the government is in control ofthe situation.''   U.S. Embassy spokesman Susan Clyde also said she thought thebattle was over.   ``We stand by our statement of the past few days. We supportPresident Avril so that he can return to his work for theestablishment of democracy,'' Clyde said.   There were unconfirmed reports of casualties among soldiers andcivilians. One report said shells overshot their mark and hitnearby houses.   But officials at the state hospital across a blocked street fromthe barracks said they had no casualties from the fighting. And nocasualties were reported at the military hospital, a nearby privatehospital that caters to wealthy Haitians or by the Red Cross.   Diplomats said a cease-fire had been declared after three hours'fighting, although sporadic gunfire continued elsewhere.   A man listening on a citizens-band radio heard soldiers sayingthe barracks had been overrun by loyalist troops and that therebels were disarmed and forced to lie on the floor face-down withtheir hands over their heads.   The white, neo-classical palace and the mustard-colored barracksadjoin one other and are surrounded by the same wall.   The action began at 7:40 p.m. and reporters watched from asecond-floor terrace of the Holiday Inn as at least one armored carof the 1,000-member Presidential Guard rumbled across the plaza infront of the palace and fired its cannon. Guardsmen took positionsin the plaza.   It appeared five armored cars surrounded the barracks, andwithin 20 minutes more than a dozen cannon shots accompanied bysteady machine gun fire could be heard.   Civilians fled the area, some rushing the doors of the hotel.Reporters dived for cover as explosions reverberated through thebuilding and tracer bullets zipped overhead.   State-run radio played romantic French songs during the fighting.   It was impossible to determine the extent of support within the7,000-man army for the rebellion centered on the 700-man Dessalinesbattalion, the military's second-biggest unit, and the 400-manLeopards unit.   The rebels earlier Friday seized control of a radio station, andyouths supporting them built barricades of burning tires along amain street.   The rebel soldiers in a statement on Radio Soleil accused Avrilof ``war crimes.''   U.S. Ambassador Brunson McKinley earlier offered Washington'ssupport for Avril's government, which foiled a coup attempt Sundaybut has been stymied by the mutiny.   Rebels rode through the capital in jeeps, pickup trucks andmotorbikes, shooting in the air and warning people to go home,witnesses said. Youths set fire to tires along the five-mile routeof Delmas Avenue, a main artery in the capital.   Stores, schools and offices in the capital were closed under astate of emergency.   McKinley met with Avril at the National Palace on the third dayof a standoff between loyalist troops and rebels, the U.S. Embassysaid.   On Thursday night, loyal troops fired on rebels who commandeereda government vehicle. Witnesses said four rebels were killed, but adiplomatic source said two died and one was wounded.   Haitians were largely cut off from developments Thursday nightafter loyal troops cut the transmitter cables of at least threeradio stations that had ignored censorship imposed by thegovernment this week.   Diplomatic sources said loyalist officers, including interimarmy chief Maj. Gen. Gerard Abraham, went to Dessalines BarracksThursday to speak to the rebels and returned with an understandingthat a reconciliation agreement was reached. But the rebels renegedon the deal, said the sources.   Radio Soleil, a Roman Catholic station that remained on the air,announced it was being occupied by mutinous soldiers.   An unidentified soldier said they had seized the station to denya statement by Avril that the rebels had decided to end theirdispute. ``That's a lie,'' the soldier said. ``We are holding ourground.''   The rebels accuse the government of favoritism toward thePresidential Guard in pay and living conditions and of arbitrarilydismissing senior officers in a U.S.-backed crackdown on drugs andcorruption.   Avril, 50, came to power in a coup led by noncommissionedofficers demanding democratic reforms and an end to state-sponsoredviolence. The coup ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.   Avril has restored some constitutional rights suspended in 1987and approved the establishment of an electoral council to preparefor elections.   Thugs killed 34 voters in November 1987, thwarting Haiti's firstfree elections in more than 30 years.</TEXT></DOC>
