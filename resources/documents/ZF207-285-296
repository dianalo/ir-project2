(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A baker's dozen CASE tools for PCs and workstations Software engineering is arelatively new field of study, dating back only to the 1970s.andP;  Prior to thistime, programming technology focused on better languages, compilers, andmachine-code optimization.andP;  But as machine power increased and compilersbecame more tolerant of inefficient code, system methodology becameincreasingly interesting to professional programmers.andM;The development of structured programming was the first indicator of thisheightened interest.andP;  This technique allowed large projects to be broken intomanageable parts and divided among several people or assembled from smallermodules for ease of debugging.andP;  However, structured programming was uselesswithout an underlying analytical technique for determining programrequirements.andP;  Structured analysis filled this need, allowing logical,systematic identification of essential processes to be determined beforecoding began.andM;Approaches to software design fall into two broad categories.andP;  In one, tasksto be performed are identified and used as the basis of the process; in theother, the data to be manipulated are treated as the kernel of the problem.andO;These are referred to as the process-flow and data-structure techniques.andM;Process-flow analysis, otherwise known as top-down design, defines theprocesses a system must perform to convert an input to an output.andP;  Theseprocesses reflect the actual flow of data between actions.andM;To create a design using process flow, an analyst breaks the system down intolarge tasks, producing a diagram to indicate the relationship between thetasks and the data transferred between them.andP;  Each process is subsequentlydecomposed into fundamental processes called primitives.andP;  This often mayinvolve many levels of data-flow diagrams, which are generally referred to inparent-and-child nomenclature.andM;These process-flow diagrams closely mirror the processes involved inprogramming a task, and the use of a pictorial representation of the systemis a great benefit.andP;  However, process-flow diagrams have severe limitationsfor larger systems.andP;  It is difficult to translate a series of process-flowdiagrams into a final deliverable program with any set methodology.andP;  Largersystems, which often require large databases, are difficult to optimize withprocess-flow techniques.andM;Data-structured techniques analyze the original data and the transformationsrequired to achieve the desired output.andP;  This technique is also calledbottom-up design.andP;  Though this term doesn't describe the system accurately,the term &quot;requirement-driven&quot; does: a programmer determines what is expected,and then figures out how to get it from the information available.andM;With data-structured design, each process that accepts or transmitsinformation from one form to another is identified.andP;  The flow of data betweenthese is referred to as a transaction.andM;The resistance most analysts have to data flows has hampered data-structureddesign; programmers are used to writing or specifying code, and data flows donot closely follow code structure.andP;  Further, the diagrams used indata-structured techniques are usually complex and difficult to understand.andM;A wide variety of diagramming techniques are used in software engineeringtoday, and each has its proponents and detractors.andP;  The most frequentlyencountered diagrams are data-flow or logic-flow techniques, depending on theaspects of software they define.andM;A data-flow diagram is usually called a flowchart.andP;  It refers to a series ofelements whose shapes reflect the operations of a process at each step.andP;  Eachelement indicates the input and output at these stages, and is accompanied bya short narrative reflecting the action to be taken on the input to producethe output.andM;Some methodologies hold that data-flow diagrams should be kept simple,because larger diagrams become too complicated.andP;  An older school of thoughtholds that data-flow diagrams are useful in diagramming an entire developmentcycle.andP;  In some cases, a mixture of the two approaches is reached by creatinga parent/child diagram wherein a main data-flow diagram may call others toexplain the process described in a single element in more detail.andM;A state-transition diagram shows the various stages of a particular object orprocess.andP;  Each state is maintained separately, with notations indicatinginput and output.andP;  The input and output of all stages must have similarbehavior.andM;In a state-transition diagram such as that in Figure 1, each rectangular boxshows different states.andP;  The arrowed lines indicate transitions that takeplace during the occurrence of an event.andP;  Process-flow diagrams (Figure 2)are usually crude representations of steps that define a process.andP;  Each stepis a rectangle with a brief description.andP;  Lines with arrows depict thegeneral direction of the flow of information.andP;  Iterative and feedback systemsare displayed in a similar manner.andP;  Because of the unsophisticated nature ofthe process-flow diagram, it can represent anything from the top level of aproject to in-depth analysis of a module.andM;Logic-flow charts display logical processes.andP;  They represent a number oflogical constructs in greater detail, including iterative routines (looping,repetition), sequences, and branching (conditional, unconditional, andselective).andP;  Logic-flow charts are usually of little value to a programmerattempting to create a structured design, and may bear little obviousresemblance to program logic in complex systems.andM;A wide variety of logic-flow systems are in use.andP;  None is widely accepted; afew well-known systems will be discussed briefly.andM;Nassi-Schneiderman charts are highly structured logic-flow charts (Figure 3).andO;They are usually independent of programming language and methodology and showall possible branches made by a program (IF...ELSE conditionals, forexample).andP;  They let you trace logic flow throughout a program without losingyourself in the structure.andP;  Although these diagrams appear complex at firstglance, they can become useful tools with use.andM;A Warnier-Orr diagram shows a program, function, or data hierarchy (thoughany other quality can also be diagrammed).andP;  It uses a series of brackets torepresent hierarchies (Figure 4).andP;  Each bracket defines a set of logic andthe full set of brackets relating to a condition at the start of thebreakdown.andP;  Inside the sets, a simple listing of process elements is created(these listings may be broken down further).andP;  Logic functions such as AND andOR may be represented in a diagram, and iterations are shown by use ofbrackets.andM;A hierarchical input-process-output (HIPO) diagram shows hierarchicalstructure plus data and process flow.andP;  A sample HIPO diagram is shown inFigure 5.andP;  Inside the IPO part of the diagram, the processes are explained.andM;The software covered in this review ranges in price from less than $100 to$10,000, from single-purpose utilities to comprehensive life-cycle automationsystems.andP;  Choosing the right tool will depend on needs: if only aflowcharting tool is required, purchasing a full-blown development systemwould be wasteful and counter-productive.andP;  On the other hand, a large projectthat requires a data dictionary and full process-flow descriptions cannot beaccomplished using simpler software.andM;In most cases, the larger software systems reviewed have additional hiddencosts.andP;  The high-end products almost all require extensive training and havea support and upgrade path that increases the shelf price.andP;  A 286 or 386system is a practical, if not mandatory, requirement.andP;  Most of the softwarerequires 640K of RAM, and some preferred extended or expanded memory.andP;  Amouse is required for most and recommended for all.andP;  EGA monitors and cardsare almost essential, although Hercules monitors (and compatible systems) area suitable alternative for many.andP;  Site licenses, where available, are alsonecessary for systems that support more than one user.andP;  It is not unusual forthe costs of the most elaborate systems to exceed $25,000 per user for aproper development system, and this figure does not including training (forwhich most vendors charge several thousand dollars per person per course) ortime spent on a sometimes extensive learning curve.andM;Clearly, a full-blown CASE system is not something to be taken lightly, andthe acquisition of such a system should be done only with the full knowledgeof its purpose, capabilities, and potential payback.andM;All software was tested on at least two machine configurations.andP;  The testingsystems were: an Apricot VX 386 with 157MB hard disk, 8MB RAM, and a HerculesGraphics adapter; Apricot Xen-i 286 with 20MB hard disk, 1.5MB RAM, EGA card,and monitor; COMPAQ 386/25 with 140MB hard disk, 2MB RAM, EGA card, andmonitor; and Samsung 286 with 40MB hard disk, 2MB RAM, and Hercules Graphicsadapter.andP;  Each machine was equipped with a mouse: two used the Microsoftmouse, one had a Logitech serial mouse, and one had an Apricottrackball-style mouse and a Logitech bus mouse.andP;  All had math co-processors.andO;The printers used included Kyocera lasers, Epson and compatible dot-matrixprinters, and a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet Series II.andM;Each software package was installed according to the manufacturer'sinstructions on a clean machine (no TSRs or esoteric software packages wereallowed on the disk) and used for several trial projects.andP;  Then the systemwas loaded with a typical programmer's assortment of TSRs (including spoolersand pop-up utilities) and tested again.andM;When applicable, a real-world project was simulated on the software by atleast one person; the larger and more complicated packages were tested byseveral users.andP;  These projects included various aspects of a very largedatabase application being created at my workplace and modeling of severalother projects.andP;  Testers' notes, comments, and complaints were reviewed, andcomplaints were reexamined for biases due to methodology.andM;Our ambition was to provide a report on every PC- and workstation-based CASEtool on the market.andP;  The result, while occupying many magazine pages, fallssomewhat short of that goal.andP;  This article is based on our experiences withproducts from vendors who agreed to supply software for evaluation and whosubsequently made good on that promise.andP;  From an initial list of more than 30products, we wound up receiving 13...and some of these required lengthynegotiations and the signing of nondisclosure agreements that could, incertain lights, be interpreted as prohibiting publication of this review.andM;This is not entirely surprising; CASE is a complicated discipline and morecompanies are fearful about putting their products into the hands ofprogrammers who lack indoctrination into their own methodologies.andP;  Despitethe vendors' cold feet, we received and reviewed a large sample of variedproducts.andM;Because of the complexity of many of these packages, it was impractical tolist all the capabilities of each system and the details of software-specificmethodologies.andP;  Instead, I have included a brief summary of each softwarepackage, machine requirements, outstanding or poor features, and a user'sanalysis.andM;The following tools provide one or more diagramming functions.andP;  These are nottrue CASE products, but they do provide an essential element of programminganalysis: graphical representations of systems, data, or logic flow.andM;OptimaandM;BracketsandM;Brackets is a single-purpose tool: it creates Warnier-Orr diagrams of almostunlimited size.andP;  It also supports a separate COBOL code-generation utility.andM;The Brackets package consists of two tools: the Warnier-Orr diagramming tooland a product called Menu(s)/PC, which is a front-end DOS shell.andP;  Only theformer is reviewed here.andP;  The manual is a standard-sized, three-ring binderwith three diskettes, two of which contain Brackets.andP;  The manual is notprinted very clearly, and several pages in the review copy had smudged screenimages that were nonetheless readable.andM;Brackets requires 512K RAM (640K recommended) and DOS 3.0 or above.andP;  Itsupports IBM- and Epson-compatible printers.andP;  A mouse is not supported.andM;Brackets has a Lotus-like selection menu.andP;  For first-time users, anelectronic introduction and mini-tutorial are included.andM;Using Brackets is easy.andP;  Creation of multiple-layered Warnier-Orr diagramscan be accomplished by a new user in minutes once the system is understood.andO;Its spreadsheet look lends an air of familiarity, but the use of numerickeypad keys for different alternate functions took some testers a littlewhile to adjust to.andP;  Various parts of Warnier-Orr diagrams can be zoomed inon as required, or reduced to essentials (as an outline editor does).andP;  Wefound no limits to the size of Warnier Orr diagrams we could create, althoughdeclining readability will usually be a user's clue to stop.andM;As a single-purpose tool, Brackets works well.andP;  For those who wantunsophisticated CASE on a shoe-string, without an elaborate data dictionaryand modeling, this is worth considering.andP;  For generation of Warnier-Orrdiagrams, it is as good as any of the tested comprehensive products costingmuch more (but also offering more).andM;Meta Software Corp.andM;DesignandM;Design is a graphics tool that allows creation of structured charts anddiagrams with a large variety of elemental shapes.andP;  Design requires 640K RAM,a Windows-compatible mouse, and an EGA, Hercules, or other Windows-compatibledisplay adapter.andP;  The manual suggests use of an AT or similar machine andrecommends a hard disk with 1MB RAM.andP;  Windows (v.andP;  2.00 or later) isrequired.andM;Like all Windows products, Design utilizes pull-down menus to drive thesoftware.andP;  Creating a diagram consists of choosing a shape and positioningand sizing it as needed.andP;  Connectors between diagram elements are drawn byindicating the start and end elements.andP;  A number of manipulation functionsare available for global resizing, rearranging, and similar cosmetic uses.andO;An alignment function lines elements up in a row in multiple dimensions toenhance the appearance of charts.andM;Styles of connectors and arrow orientation can be customized.andP;  Ambitioususers can define the size of the boxes and arrowheads in terms of points.andO;Several other customization functions are available.andM;A bypertext function allows a note to be attached to any part of a diagramand pulled up as needed.andP;  Notes can be attached directly to an elements toprovide a greater level of detail than the normal element shape.andP;  Picturesthat were created in other Windows packages can be included in Designdiagrams.andP;  Diagram hierarchies can be set up with a zoom system.andM;Design adheres to no methodology; it is a free-flow diagramming tool.andP;  Theresponse to the approach taken by Meta Software will depend on the user'sreaction to Windows.andP;  Those who like Windows will like Design: those whodon't won't.andP;  It performed very well in all tests, and produced someterrific-looking free-flow diagrams.andM;Optima Inc.andM;DesingVisionandM;Design Vision is a drawing tool that runs under the Windows environment.andO;According to the mannual, it is &quot;the most potent CASE graphics packagecurrently available.&quot;andP;  This is an exaggeration, but DesignVision is certainlya useful product for those who work in Windows.andM;DesignVision requires 640K of RAM, Windows (any version), and aWindows-supported mouse.andP;  The documentation states that at least 20MB of harddisk storage is required, but this is somewhat misleading since DesignVisioncomes on just diskettes.andP;  The manual is well produced and clearly written.andM;A series of menus guides the user through the various options available.andP;  Theusual windows messages appear whenever errors are trapped or some deletion isrequested.andP;  Printer support is handled through the Windows system.andM;DesignVision charts are a cross between flowcharts and structure charts.andO;These may be nested and zoomed from parent to child.andP;  A data dictionaryconsisting of the element name and short-and-long-form descriptions iscreated from the chart elements.andP;  Some customization of the diagramming styleis possible, including the ability to select the shapes and styles of theconnectors.andP;  The element-share library is not large, but a bit-map optionallows customized shapes to be generated.andP;  It is also possible to copy andchange the sizes of elements or groups of elements is a diagram.andM;DesignVision generates several reports that summarize the various elementsdefined and their descriptions, plus a report that lists all connecting lineson a chart with their sources, destinations, and connector names.andP;  Thereports too can be customized.andM;Some of the testers praised the ease with which DesignVision could be used inthe Windows environment, espcially those who prefer working in such a shell.andO;However, testers who do not like the Windows environment tended to dislikethe software for similar reasons: great dependence on the mouse, incessantpop-up windows, and perceived lack of freedom.andM;The charts DesignVision produces are clean and easy compose, but they aren'trigorous; they aren't checked against any design methodoloty.andP;  They musttherefore be regarded as free-flow diagrams.andM;While DesignVision is only a simple diagramming tool, it performs that taskwell.andP;  Due to the Windows environment, DesignVision is quick and easy tolearn and use.andP;  A more rigorous design methodoloty would increase the CASEutility of the package, but that might impose restrictions on it that wouldinterfere with its ease of use.andM;HavenTree Software Ltd.andM;EasyFlowandM;EasyFlow is designed for one purpose: producing flowcharts.andP;  The EasyFlowpackage consists of one disk (which is not copy-protected), a quick referencecard, and a paperback manual.andM;The software requires very few system resources to operate.andP;  A hard disk isuseful, though EasyFlow operated on all the test machines from floppies andwith as little as 256K of free memory.andP;  A mouse is useful too, but theprogram operates quite satisfactorily without one.andP;  The program has a routinethat automatically senses the monitor type, although this can be over-riddenby the user.andP;  The display was clean and crisp on both EGA and Herculesgraphics adapters.andM;The manual is written in a light, clean, descriptive manner, and in severalplaces takes a tongue-in-cheek look at software, licenses, and the CASEindustry.andM;The manual introduces the program in a quick exercise that rapidlyillustrates the functioning of EasyFlow and the basic commands available.andO;HavenTree Software offers a limited version that does not save the flowchartscreated, and prints &quot;SAMPLE&quot; on printed flowcharts.andP;  This test software canbe upgraded to the full-featured version.andM;When using a keyboard, function keys control most of the commands used byEasyFlow, and the mouse buttons to pull up windows with the options.andP;  Inpractice, the mouse was found to be faster and easier to use, although sometesters have an aversion to mice in general and liked the keyboardfunctionality just as well.andM;EasyFlow breaks each page into a 16-by-16 grid for flowchart symbols.andO;Flowcharts are created usings a large library of standard flowchart symbols,many in different sizes, as well as some less frequently encountered shapesand symbols.andP;  A symbol editor allows users to customize their own shapes ormodify existing ones.andM;In use, the cursor is positioned where the flowchart sysmbol is to be placed,and the shape is then selected.andP;  The text to be enclosed by the shape (orplaced outside if applicable, as with decision shapes) is entered, and thesoftware automatically formats the text, although this may be overruled.andM;Connections between flowchart symbols are accomplished simply by moving thecursor.andP;  EasyFlow is designed for rectangularly shaped flowchart lines;free-form squiggles are straightened out.andP;  The only time this causes anyconfusion or inconvenience is when a lot of paths are crossing or joining.andM;Flowcharts may be zoomed in or out of view to see or hide details.andP;  A previewfunction allows the user to look at the entire document or examine it page bypage.andP;  In testing, a 10-page circuitous flowchart was generated and refinedin a manner of minutes, with a degree of ease not found in most of the othertested software.andM;The user may customize EasyFlow to a large extent.andP;  One of the most usefulutility options was a mouse-speed adjustment, and this feature, when couplewith a batch-print utility, made using the program a joy.andP;  EasyFlow isdesigned exclusively for producing flowcharts, and it does this admirably,without involving excessive elaboration or involvement.andP;  EasyFlow is easy tolearn and more than flexible enough for most flowcharting purposes.andP;  It isalso a lot of fun to use.andP;  If flowcharts are an integral part of your systemanalysis, ignore EasyFlow at your own risk.andM;The products in the next category include a number of packages that featurediagramming tools and data dictionaries.andP;  These are not quite asfull-featured as the comprehensive systems reviewed later, but provide amini-CASE environment.andP;  Most can be broken into smaller modules and used asseparate tools.andM;Helix Corp.andM;AdvantageandM;Advantage is a combination of a data dictionary and aspecification-generator.andP;  The software is supplied on a single, high-densitydiskette.andP;  System requirements are not specified in the documentation, but itseems to require 640K RAM, and preferably a fast machine such as an 80286 or80386.andP;  A mouse is not supported.andM;The graphics in Advantage are primitive.andP;  No data-flow or structure-chartsystem is available.andP;  All screens are simply ASCII text and include nothingfancier than reverse highlight.andM;The profiler section of Advantage models screens, reports, and dataprocesses, and generates reports based on these models.andP;  A series of screensspecify information about the application and the item to be modeled.andP;  Eachmodule of the system is the explained through a series of screens.andP;  When thisis completed and sample screens have been mocked up, a series of reports canbe generated that summarize the information the user has entered.andM;The Active Dictionary Builder is billed as an expert system for designingrelational databases.andP;  It performs validation of file and field informationas it is used.andP;  A cross-reference function provides a list of elements in thedatabases used in an application.andP;  The dictionary builder was designed inRevelation Technology's Revelation database management system, and allows adata dictionary for a project to be produced over several databases.andP;  Itgenerates a number of reports on the contents of the system.andP;  Detailed noteson each field can be appended.andM;Advantage is difficult to assess in combination with other systems.andP;  It lacksthe sophisticated interface, fancy graphics, and elaborate manuals of itscompetitors.andP;  However, it is a solid product that produced exactly what itwas supposed to without fuss.andP;  As a utility for someone who doesn't need afull-blown CASE tool, Advantage is more than adequate; it generates thereports and specifications needed to form the basis of a system-designdocument.andP;  The lack of a fancy interface can be seen as either a plus or aminus.andM;Computer Sciences Corp.andM;Design GeneratorandM;Design Generator lets users proceed from the development of a structuredspecification to an initial design stage using data-flow diagrams,mini-specifications, and a data dictionary.andP;  It is written in Smalltalk/V286,and a copy of this language is included.andM;The Design Generator package consists of a standard-sized manual withwell-printed pages and three disketes.andP;  Its requirements are stiff: an 80286or 80386 machine with 3MB RAM (above 640K must be extended RAM), coprocessor,EGA or Hercules card and monitor, and mouse.andM;Data-flow diagrams are produced in conjunction with a data dictionary, andall elements must balance.andP;  The diagramming symbols used by Design Generatorare not standard: a number of unique symbols are used to indicate data flow.andM;The automatic design generator uses a series of rules to compute a certaintyfactor for each process on the data-flow diagram to determine which elementsare central transforms (the processes responsible for the conversion ofinputs to outputs).andP;  While this may be an interesting exercise in artificialintelligence, most analysts already recognize which elements are centraltransforms by the function each transform performs.andM;The learning process for this product was slowed by he manual.andP;  Most of thetesters found it difficult to use and learn.andP;  Screen images are virtuallynonexistent in the manual and no tutorial exists.andM;Production of diagrams using Design Generator seems to take longer than withother similar products, and the resultant charts were not as clear andconcise as they could have been.andP;  Although the concept behind DesignGenerator is interesting, several testers were unwilling to continue usingthe product.andM;The huge memory requirements of this product create a major stumbling blockto its acceptance.andP;  The typical programmer's workstation doesn't have 3MB ofRAM, and it is difficult to justify the added expense when other productsrequire far less.andM;Scandura Intelligent Systems Inc.andM;ProdocandM;The Prodoc package looks uninspiring.andP;  It consists of a three-ring binderthat includes only a couple of diskette holders with seven diskettes and arather strange-looking hardware key timer.andP;  The manual has several typos init, so some information critical to a novice computer user is actuallyincorrect.andM;Prodoc requires 640K RAM and a hard disk to hold the contents of the sevendiskettes.andP;  The hardware key is a small block that attaches to the parallelport with a cable, which has another block at the end where modules can beplugged in.andP;  Plugging this into the serial port can damage the port.andP;  It isreally quirky: printers could not be connected or disconnected with thedevice in use and powered.andP;  The entire system must be powered down first orthe key part of the device removed.andM;Prodoc relies on a series of rules for design methodology developed by J.andO;Scandura.andP;  It's based on a concept called a flowform.andP;  A flowform graphicallyshows the procedures and functions, logic flow, and program structure much asa Nassi-Schneiderman diagram does, but in a more structured way.andP;  Flowformsare longer, but simpler to read.andM;One of Prodoc's features is its support of pseudocode for Pascal, Ada, and C.andO;It performs perfunctory syntax-checking, and generates declarations and somecode.andP;  Once a data-flow diagram has been created, the data-flow instructionscan be replaced by valid language instructions.andM;Prodoc was an interesting experiment.andP;  It worked well, but I couldn't escapethe feeling that the programs generated using Prodoc's flowforms could havebeen written in a fraction of the time without them.andP;  The flowform concept isinteresting, but this product does not really fit in the standard CASElibrary.andP;  It is in a niche all its own.andM;Visible Systems Corp.andM;Visible Analyst WorkbenchandM;The Visible Analyst Workbench is a set of four tools that can be usedseparately or combined into a more elaborate CASE system.andP;  Its componentsinclude a basic graphics system for data-flow and structure diagrams (one isa free-form system, the other a rigorous methodology-based system), a datadictionary, and a system for building prototypes and simulations.andM;The Visible Analyst Workbench requires a hard disk, 640K of RAM, and mouse.andO;The package works fine on all tested graphics cards.andP;  The product alsocontains a single-full-size manual.andP;  The number of diskettes varies dependingon format; five 360K floppies are standard.andM;The Visible Analyst tool is a free-form, mouse-driven package that includes anumber of standard symbols and the capability to generate custom symbols andelements.andP;  A nesting system for parent-child layouts is included.andP;  Elements,labels, and data-flow systems can be customized as required.andP;  A number oficons are available for more illustrative diagrams.andM;The Visible Rules tool is a similar diagramming system but uses methodologyto force proper diagram layout and structure.andP;  It includes a number of usefulfunctions, such as automatic numbering of elements, checks for split ordangling data flows, input and output consistency checks, andcontext-checking.andP;  Either Yourdon-DeMarco or Gane and Sarson rules can beselected.andP;  An optional system supports Warnier-Orr diagrams.andM;The Visible Dictionary provides a standard dictionary system for definitionof all data elements, processes, files, charts, and other items.andO;Cross-reference generation, alias checks, audit trails, and various searchoptions are all supported.andP;  A number of reports can be generated.andM;The Visible Prototyper allows a series of screens to be designed and linkedtogether for simulation of a system.andP;  Requirements for the prototype aredefined and validated as the system is designed.andM;The Visible Analyst Workbench was very easy to use and simple to learn.andP;  Themanual is written well enough to let users get going quickly enough to avoidfrustration.andP;  Testers enjoyed the ability to create free-form diagramswithout rules as a general introduction to a system-design specification,although the rigorous diagramming was certainly more useful for the detailedaspects of system developments.andM;Although Visible Analyst Workbench doesn't have the flash of the morecomprehensive packages, none of the programmers who tested it would hesitateto use it again.andM;The final group of software packages consists of complete CASE systemsincluded in a single operating environment.andP;  They are designed and intendedto be complete and offer all the material needed for even the most elaborateCASE study.andP;  These packages are all expensive, and many have a very stifflearning curve.andM;LBMSandM;Auto-Mate PlusandM;Auto-Mate Plus is a large package consisting of two standard-size manuals anda varying number of diskettes depending on the installation (the test set had17 diskettes).andP;  The manual printing is small, and the boldface type is notvery clear.andP;  Although the manual is well written and all testers remarked onthe ease with which the system was leared (due in part to the layout of themanual), a better reproduction of the manual pages would increase thepackage's attractiveness considerably.andP;  The analysis section of thedocumentation takes users through the capabilities of Auto-Mate Plus andbriefly explains the various mehtodologies it supports.andP;  System requirementsinclude 640K RAM, 12MB hard disk space, and a standard video controller card(including VGA).andP;  A mouse is recommended.andP;  The test system used the SuperLokcopy-protection system, requiring installation of hidden files on the harddisk.andP;  According to supplied product literature, the next release will dropthis requirement.andM;Auto-Mate Plus provides a variety of standard CASE functions, includingdata-structure diagrams and an associated data dictionary, arelationship-tracking system, and data-flow diagrams.andM;Drawing logical data-structure and data-flow diagrams is similar toprocedures used by other packages.andP;  A zoom feature for parent-childstructures is included.andP;  Logical-data structure diagrams support only alimited number if element shapes, but these work fine for most applications.andO;A relationship data screen allows tracking of the elements and the logiclflow to be explained in more detail.andP;  The tracker is integrated with the datadictionary.andP;  Descriptions of the various elements of structure and data-flowdiagram can be added and managed at this stage with a forms-managementutility.andP;  Shapes and arrows are selected from a set of shapes at the bottomof the editor screen.andP;  A picture editor allows customization of graphics forinclusion in the structure charts.andP;  A mouse is of great benefit for thismodule.andP;  Most aspects of the package can be customized by the user.andM;A logical design editor allows a user to create full logic-flow diagrams morerigorously than with a free-form editor.andP;  The conversion of a logical designto a physical design is covered and a series of utilities to assist the useris included.andP;  A wide variety of reports is generated by Auto-Mate Plus, whichhelps create a system-design document quickly from the basics.andP;  Thedata-dictionary functions are comprehensive and allow construction andmanipulation of data elements to whatever extent the user requires.andM;Auto-Mate Plus is available with optional interfaces for several largedatabase management systems, including ADABAS, DB2, and IDMS.andP;  We brieflyexamined the Oracle interface, which provides the capability to move variousaspects of the design generated in Auto-Mate Plus directly into the Oracleenvironment without rekeying.andM;Auto-Mate Plus is an interesting product that has a number of features notusually encountered in a CASE tool.andP;  The inclusion of a picture editor wasappreciated, but the major feather in its cap is the integration torelational database management systems directly.andP;  After designing a system inAuto-Mate Plus, the testers were able to export the data dictionariesdirectly to Oracle as well as move some of the physical design aspects (forexample, screens).andM;Auto-Mate Plus is a product worthy of attention.andP;  If the manuals were cleanedup in presentation and the copy protection dropped, this product wouldcertainly be a contender for first place.andP;  As it is, it fulfills its taskswell.andM;Nastec Corp.andM;DesignAidandM;The DesignAid package is impressive.andP;  It comes in a sizable box containingthree large manuals, a diskette box with 13 diskettes, a hardware key device,a plethora of additional documentation (quick-reference, flip-ring binder,outline sheet, and supporting documentation), and a cookbook.andP;  (I kid younot.andP;  the various recipes are laid out like a system-design specification!)andM;DesignAid requires a hard disk.andP;  Although it will work on an XT, it is reallybest when coupled with an 80286 or 80386.andP;  A parallel port for the hardwarekey is required, as is 640K of RAM.andP;  An EGA, MDA, Hercules Graphics, and somethird-party boards are supported, as is the 3270 APA or XGA if a 3270 PC isused.andP;  LAN versions are available.andP;  A mouse is not required, but can be usedand is convenient.andM;A security system is available that limits access to project files toauthorized users, even in the stand-alone version.andP;  For an office that hasinstalled DesignAid on a dedicated machine, this is useful for maintainingsome privacy and preventing unwanted tampering or accidental damage.andM;All references to keystrokes in the DesignAid manual refer to DesignAidcommands such as Go and Undo.andP;  These commands must be picked from thekeyboard using a keyboard map in the quick-reference manual.andP;  Pictures of theIBM Enhanced, AT, XT, and 3270 keyboards are laid out with the DesignAid intitle on the keys.andP;  although this results in considerable hunting and peckingin the early stages, it does become easier as the software is used.andM;DesignAid supports both Yourdon-DeMarco and Gane and Sarson process-modelingsymbols with a variety of diagramming tools.andP;  Available diagrams includeNassi-Schneiderman, Michael Jackson, Warnier-Orr, process flow, HIPO, andstructure flowcharts.andP;  Furthermore, with a user-definable symbol editor, thesystem can be customized to any other diagramming technique.andM;DesignAid automatically checks system design with a built-in analyzer.andP;  Allerrors are reported on screen, and checks are comrehensive.andP;  A number ofimport and export functions between DesignAid modules make the creation ofsystem documents automatic.andP;  Real-time modeling is a joy with DesignAid, andits utilization of Ward-Mellor graphics makes it easy to complete such asystem rapidly with full error-checking.andM;In terms of presentation, DesignAid was the most impressive package reviewed.andO;The manuals are descriptive and elaborate, and the software lives up to themanual's promises.andP;  The number of available tools in DesignAid should satisfyany analyst's requiremens.andP;  For those looking for a comprehensive CASEpackage, DesignAid is a good choice.andM;Index Technology Corp.andM;ExceleratorandM;Excelerator is probably the best-known product in the PC CASE market, and itis one of the most widely used comprehensive CASE tools.andP;  This kind ofexposure has helped Index Technology refine and improve its product with aconsiderable amount of user feedback.andM;Excelerator comes in a slipcase box containing three manuals (tutorial, userguide, and reference guide), and a smaller case holding 14 diskettes, ahardware key, and various additional documentation that includes aninstallation guide and product notes.andM;Excelerator requires an 80286- or 80386-based machine (it will not work onsome clones) equipped with 640K of RAM, a parallel port of for the hardwarekey, a hard disk, EGA card, Hercules or Tecmar Graphics Master graphics card,Microsoft Bus mouse, and DOS v. 3.1 or later.andP;  It is very sensitive about themouse: Logitech's Bus mouse simply did not work in the test machines.andO;Excelerator can be run on an XT, but the speed and performance in our testswere sbysmal.andP;  Versions that support 3COM, IBM PC Network, and Banyan Vinesnetworks are available.andM;Installation of the review copy was difficult.andP;  The automatic installationroutine did not work on any of the test machines, and after receiving two newdiskettes, we still failed to achieve an automatic installation.andP;  However,the Index Technology hotline provided assistance in performing a manualinstallation, which was frustrated by the fact that a Logitech mouse was inuse and the program would not respond.andP;  Substitution of Microsoft's productsovled the problem, but the incompatibility was surprising.andP;  Excelerator wasteh only product to cause this kind of trouble, so sticking to the suggestedequipment list is mandatory.andM;The manuals are very well written, and the tutorial has users up and runningin a short time.andP;  The user and reference guides are perfect-bound (like abook) and although this may worry some users about breaking the spines, itdid not occur during testing.andM;Excelerator has a log-on screen that requires a user name and password.andO;Users are added and maintained by a system manager.andP;  Although of primary usein a network, in stand-alone configurations this security can preventunauthorized access to project details.andM;Presentation graphics provide a layout system that incorporates elements ofdata flow and some icons.andP;  Connections can be drawn any way the user wishes:they are not necessarily minimum-line configurations, but may cross otherlines and loop around elements as required.andM;True data-flow diagrams are supported with parent-child levels.andP;  A miniatureversin of the diagram is displayed in teh corner of the screen, soorientation is easy to determine at any point.andP;  The data-flow diagram can becoupled to the data dictionary, allowing a user to examine an element of thediagram, then expand that element to its dictionary parts.andP;  Configuration ofthe data-flow system can be changed by the user.andM;Each process on a data-flow diagram can have an attached process descriptionthat describes the process in more detail, then accesses the data dictionary.andO;The dictionary lists the element or record names, their occurrences,sequences, and types.andP;  Adding or changing the dictionary contents is easy.andM;An anlysis section of Excelerator includes a report generator that providespredefined and user-defined report capabilities.andP;  A prototype screengenerator allows sample screens with reverse-high-light areas for input datafields to be created.andP;  An extended analysis system (covered in a separatemanual) explains validation rules and analytical techniques.andM;The user guide takes the user through various aspects of the software,showing all available commands and configuration parameters.andP;  The referenceguide provides extra detail.andP;  most testers approved of the layout and contentof these manuals.andM;Excelerator lived up to its reputation as one of the best CASE tools on themarket.andP;  The product is easy to learn and use, and provides a quickly learnedCASE method for professional analysis.andP;  It is also suitable fora casual useby scientists and engineers.andP;  Except for our hassles with configuration andinstallation, it performed flawlessly.andP;  As long as the hardware suggested inthe manual is used, this seems like a package all serious CASE users shouldinvestigate.andM;McDonnell Douglas InformationandM;Systems Co.andM;ProKit WORKBENCHandM;The ProKit WORKBENCH package consists of three diskette cases totalling 42disks; a large, threering manual; and support paraphernalia including aquick-reference card.andP;  No security device is required.andP;  The version shippedfor review included an Intel Above Board/286 populated with 512K, which isrequired for operation.andM;ProKit WORKBENCH requires at least 512K of expanded memory in addition to thestandard 640K.andP;  At least 15MB of hard-disk storage space is needed, althougha reduced system can be installed in less.andP;  EGA, Hercules, and TecmarGraphics Master cards are supported.andP;  A coprocessor is highly recommended.andP;  Amouse is mandatory and, according to the documentation, must have threebuttons, although the Microsoft mouse is supported.andP;  Printer and plottersupport is good.andM;The manual was a little difficult to wade through at first.andP;  It is written asa reference rather than as a user manual.andP;  A good glossary and index wereincluded (and much appreciated).andM;Included in the review package was a case study based on a sample projectevolved through the various stages of design.andP;  The case study acts as anexcellent tutorial and covers the majority of ProKit WORKBENCH's features.andM;The diagram editor used with ProKit WORKBENCH is based on the Gane and Sarsongraphics system and includes all standard graphic elements.andP;  ProKit WORKBENCHallows a parent-child nesting of three levels.andP;  Each level has a limit of 800symbols.andP;  For those with E-size plotters, large diagrams can be generatedwithout cutting and pasting dot-matrix printed strips of paper.andP;  Each diagramis error-checked with validation rules as it is drawn.andP;  Automatic transfer ofthe drawing elements to the data dictionary is supported.andP;  A hot key switchesthe user between the data dictionary and the diagram editor.andM;A prototyper allows an analyst to design an application's screens, reports,and forms, including help texts.andP;  Navigation systems between these items canbe defined and the system actively tested by simulation of input.andP;  A seriesof utility functions make prototyping easy and include somescreen-code-generation capabilities for several computer languages.andM;Structure charts of many forms are supported by ProKit WORKBENCH and may beeasily manipulated.andP;  ProKit WORKBENCH allows up to eight different versionsof a single project to be maintained, so deviations can be tested andexamined.andP;  A wide variety of reports can be generated through a reportingsubsystem.andM;ProKit WORKBENCH is a full professional package.andP;  Although its graphics arenot as fancy as some of the other software tested, it performs its taskseasily and readily.andP;  The ProKit WORKBENCH methodology is easier to learn thanthose of the other products in this class.andM;This is a very large system: it does practically everything a CASE user needsbut requires suitable machinery to support it.andP;  We were particularlyimpressed with the prototyper system, which allows a full demo system to begenerated quickly and easily while remaining in the CASE environment.andP;  Forthose with a hard disk and lots of processing power, this is a veryattractive system.andM;Cadre Technologies Inc.andM;Teamwork/PCSAyandM;Cadre Technologies' Teamwork/PCSA follows the structured analysis approach ofDeMarco's Structured Analysis and System Specification (Yourdon PressComputing Series, 1978) and conforms to De-Marco in all but a few minorpoints.andM;The Teamwork/PCSA package includes a copy of DeMarco's book, two diskettes, ahardware key, and a manual composed of three sections (user's guide,installation guide, and tutorial).andP;  The key itself is unique in that it isover twice the size of any other (four inches long).andP;  If the computerTeamwork/PCSA is to be used on is close to a wall, this may pose a problem.andO;In one of the test machines, the key had to be attached via a short flexiblelength of cable to allow it to fit snugly against the backplane of thecomputer.andP;  A mouse is necessary with Teamwork/PCSA; no provision exists touse a keyboard only.andM;Teamwork/PCSA requires at least 512K of RAM, a mouse, and at least twofloppies, although a hard disk should be mandatory.andP;  It will work with allcommon video boards.andP;  A parallel port for the hardware key is also necessary.andO;Postscript printers are supported, as well as the Epson FX series, HPLaserJet, IBM Proprinter, and any that emulate these.andM;A tutorial leads users through the various aspects of system design in asimple manner, although no explanation of the underlying process is covered.andO;The approach used by Teamwork/PCSA is best understood and appreciated byreading the included book on DeMarco system design first, then applying thatknowledge as the tutorial progresses.andP;  When this approach is followed, theutility of the software and its capabilities can be fully appreciated.andM;A users' guide discusses the software in more detail, explaining the programand its constituent parts.andP;  Separate chapters are dedicated to thedata-flow-diagram editor, stores, terminators, data flows, bubbles, and thedata dictionary.andM;The manuals are well written, well produced, and easy to read.andP;  All areenclosed in a single three-ring binder with a slipcase.andM;Creation of data-flow diagrams using Teamwork/PCSA is quick.andP;  However, whenthe details of the data-flow are expanded using the data dictionary, thesystem becomes rigorous: if something illegal is tried or an aspect of thesystem is missing, the user is warned.andM;Rigorous system design is encouraged by Teamwork/PCSA, and is unavoidablewhen the full capabilities of the package are used.andP;  Everything hinges aroundthe data-flow diagram, and the editor for the production of these diagrams isas good as any tested.andP;  The parent-child relationships of thedata-flow-diagram elements can themselves be examined with ease, and zoomingfrom one level to another is rapid with the mouse.andP;  Very clean diagrams canbe produced and printed using the data-flow diagram editor.andM;Stores, which hold interrelated data elements, and terminators, which containinput and output details for the project, are comprehensively dealt with.andO;The data-dictionary editor includes several very convenient functions,including circularity and redundancy checks and import/export capabilities.andM;Learning Teamwork/PCSA is not difficult, though it takes a while to grasp theinterrelationships among the menu hierarchies.andP;  When these are recalled,project design and layout with the software is relatively quick and easy.andO;The only thing that would increase proficiency would be a quick-referencecard with various menus and their triggers explained clearly.andM;Teamwork/PCSA performed well in all testing and received high marks for easeof use once the DeMarco approach was assimilated.andP;  Its small size and memoryrequirements, compared to other packages reviewed, stand it in good stead.andM;CASING the market:andM;How to pick the right toolandM;Under the Windows environment, both Meta Software's Design and Optima'sDesign Vision perform the same function with minor differences.andP;  Of the two,the testers preferred Design by a very slim margin because of the ease withwhich the package worked.andP;  Design Vision was a very close second; any choicebetween the two is one of personal preference.andM;For producing flowcharts, Haven Tree's EasyFlow was the testers' unanimouschoice.andP;  The package is easy to use and produces flowcharts the way theyshould be produced.andP;  Warnier-Orr diagram users will find that Optima'sBrackets is the only stand-alone package that performs this task.andM;In many cases a programmer or analyst does not need a full-blown CASE system,but instead requires diagramming and data-dictionary fundamentals to helpproduce a design document.andP;  The products in this category range from basic toelaborate, and the functions required are best determined by the user.andM;Particularly impressive was the Visible Analyst Workbench, which providedeverything we require from a tool of this level.andP;  The Helix Advantage system,although less elaborate, was also recommended by several testers as astraightforward design tool.andM;It is difficult to provide a quantatitive summary of any of the full-featuredpackages.andP;  Each has roughly the same capabilities and functions, though eachuses slightly different methodologies and presentations.andP;  A few features werecrucial to deciding.andM;The manuals of both Index Technology's Excelerator and Nastec's Design Aidwere highly praised.andP;  The graphics of Design Aid and Teamwork/PCSA werementioned favorably, as was the professional quality of the McDonnell DouglasProKit WORKBENCH system.andP;  The capability to merge with a full relationaldatabase management system was the strong suit of LBMS's Auto-Mate Plus.andP;  Itwas impossible to determine one overall winner in this category.andP;  Indeed, wecouldn't even find a loser.andM;When considering the expenditure of the money involved in any of thesepackages, it is best to thoroughly determine requirements, then investigatethe applicable software.andP;  None of these packages will let the user down.andP;  Ina highly competitive and growing field of software, this is remarkable.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
