The Department of Energy has forsome time been studying radon, its consequences, and methods for dealingwith radon in its various programs. A Radon Forum was judged the bestmeans to update Department Offices involved with radon, to promote efficiencyin planning and conducting programs, and to aid the coordination of futurework. Over the course of two days during February 1988, six DepartmentOffices summarized their current programs with the emphasis on radoninvolvement. These Meeting Notes are intended to present an overviewof the proceedings to those who did not attend and to recall the presentationsto those who did. Although many of these pages are reproductions of thevisual presentation materials used by the participants, they are to alarge extent self-explanatory. The last session consisted of a Commentaryand Open Discussion among the participants. The participants synthesizedthe presentations and discussed the recommendations summarized by theFacilitator, Professor Frank Parker. No claim of breakthroughs was madeduring the Radon Forum. Each report contains only an abstract and viewgraphs.</TEXT></DOC>
