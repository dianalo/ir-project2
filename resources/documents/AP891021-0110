He said there was a ``very welcome and new recognition'' at the49-nation Commonwealth summit that sanctions may be relaxed ``as webegin to see evidence that apartheid is being dismantled.''   Britain also rejected outright three other key sections of adraft declaration on South Africa.   The draft was drawn up by a 10-nation foreign ministers'committee after a day of argument. Diplomats called the exchanges``robust.''   Officials from Canada, which headed the committee, said thatwith Britain refusing to budge from its lone opposition tosanctions, ``we agreed to disagree.''   Commonwealth leaders debated the South Africa draft during aweekend retreat at Langkawi, a luxury resort island 210 milesnorthwest of Kuala Lumpur.   Malayasian officials said the final version would be issuedSunday.   At the retreat, some of the leaders played golf and PakistanPrime Minister Benazir Bhutto's 15-month-old son, Bilawal, joinedother leaders for lunch in his high chair.   In a separate development, the summit issued a declaration onthe environment which, in a victory for developed nations, rejectedan Indian demand to set up a new environmental fund.   The developed nations, including Britain, argued there was aneed for additional money but a new fund would be a wastefulduplication of U.N. programs.   Major rejected both the call to tighten financial screws onSouth Africa and to reappoint a foreign ministers' committeedrawing up the communique on financial sanctions.   ``We think they (the decisions) are both wrongheaded,'' Majorsaid in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.   Diplomatic sources said the draft avoids setting any deadlinefor reforms under threat of new sanctions.   But the foreign ministers' committee, expanded to nine with theinclusion of Malaysia, is to meet again in April to examine whetherSouth Africa's new president, F.W. de Klerk, has delivered onpromises of reform.   Despite the deep differences, the draft appeared to mark amodest shift toward consensus on South Africa _ an issue which haslong isolated Britain from its former colonies.   South Africa quit the Commonwealth in 1961.   The draft declaration encompasses a five-point Australianproposal to organize international aid for a ``post-apartheid SouthAfrica,'' and says pressures should be eased if there is``irreversible change,'' sources said.   Apart from legalizing the African National Congress guerrillamovement, that would mean de Klerk introducing legislation toabolish fundamental race laws that deny South Africa's blackmajority the vote.   Britain complained here that the Commonwealth condemns SouthAfrica constantly while remaining silent of human rights violationsby black groups, including the South West African People'sorganization in Namibia.</TEXT></DOC>
