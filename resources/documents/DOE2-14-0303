These systems use largenumbers of open celled polyurethane foam pads to support microorganisms.The pad pore structure is such that substrate and oxygen pass throughthe pad with the establishment of a differential velocity between thepads and the bulk liquid. Porous biomass support systems (PBSS) havebeen in the developmental stages for a number of years and are consideredone of the emerging innovative and alternative (I/A) wastewater treatmenttechnologies by the U.S. EPA. However, operational data is limited andlittle if any data is available on the use of PBSS for the treatmentof priority pollutants or for other advanced wastewater treatment applications.This laboratory study was undertaken to evaluate the performance of aPBSS utilizing a carbon impregnated polyurethane foam pad for removalof priority pollutants and nitrogen. The addition of activated carbonto the polyurethane pads is a unique modification of PBSS technologywhich is believed to be advantageous for the treatment of toxic and inhibitorywastewater for both priority pollutant and nitrogen removal.</TEXT></DOC>
