Dan Rostenkowski proposed to cut taxeson corporate and middle-class incomes and on some capitalgains while raising them on wealthier Americans and takingaim at the compensation of top executives.   In a closed-door meeting from which Republicans werebarred, the Illinois Democrat, chairman of the House Ways andMeans Committee, unveiled a tax-reduction alternative toPresident Bush's economic-stimulus proposal that would cost$90.9 billion over six years.</LP><TEXT>   It also would respond to the controversy over corporatepay by limiting to $1 million the annual deduction a companycould take for an executive's salary.   Committee Democrats discussed the options but made nodecisions. The panel was to meet again today to begin votingon any alterations that lawmakers propose, and it could workinto the weekend. Democratic leaders, mindful of the March 20deadline that President Bush set last month for action on avariety of his proposals, want the full House to choosebetween their plan and Mr. Bush's proposals by the end ofFebruary.   The permanent one-percentage-point cuts in the corporateincome tax to 33% and in the corporate alternative minimumtax to 19% are Mr. Rostenkowski's substitute for PresidentBush's proposal to offer business a temporary investment-taxincentive. The Rostenkowski cuts would cost $17.1 billionover six years -- 10 times the $1.7 billion cost of Mr.Bush's proposed one-year 15% extra depreciation allowance forequipment purchases.   The across-the-board corporate tax cut potentially createsa broader business coalition to help congressional Democratspass their tax package. It also would allow tax-writers toavoid creating winners and losers among businesses if theytry to limit a tax break to certain industries. But the broadcut disappointed those in ailing industries that investheavily in plant and equipment, who had hoped for aninvestment incentive aimed at them.   &quot;With an across-the-board cut, you're putting cash in thepocket of very profitable companies, and you dilute theimpact on those of us who really need a stimulant,&quot; saidMaxine Champion, a vice president of LTV Corp.   The corporate pay provision, a response to a growingcontroversy over executive salaries, would prohibit a companyfrom deducting more than $1 million a year for an executive'scompensation -- including salary, bonus and other incentives.The provision, which would raise an estimated $1.9 billionover six years, would apply only to corporate officers; itwouldn't apply to employee-owners of service corporations orto employees who didn't function as administrators orexecutives.   The Rostenkowski package's $90.9 billion six-year costdwarfs the projected $53.7 billion cost of the president'scomplete tax proposals as estimated by Congress's JointCommittee on Taxation. The chairman's more generous proposalfor a tax cut for the middle class and the proposed corporaterate cut account for much of the difference. Unlike Mr. Bush,Rep. Rostenkowski proposes to pay the entire cost with taxincreases, rather than adding to the deficit.   However, Mr. Bush and congressional Republicans aren'tbacking the president's entire tax package but a streamlinedseven-point plan. It omits the costly middle-class tax cutand costs $6.6 billion by the administration's estimate,$31.3 billion by the Joint Committee's. The disparity stemsmainly from differences in calculating the impact of Mr.Bush's proposal to cut the top capital-gains tax rate to15.4% from 28%. Democrats count that as a revenue loser,Republicans as a revenue raiser.   Republicans are livid about the plan by Democrats to putthe entire Bush package to a House vote, in an attempt todramatize that even members of the president's party don'tlike parts of it. The anger was reflected yesterday in WhiteHouse spokesman Marlin Fitzwater's condemnation of the Waysand Means Democrats. &quot;These guys are like weasels going intoa hole; you've got to wait and see where they come out,&quot; hesaid, adding, &quot;we're going to be very tough with theDemocrats who are trying to pull these games.&quot;   Although Democratic leaders have long condemned Mr. Bush'sproposed capital-gains tax cut as a bonanza for the rich, Mr.Rostenkowski bowed to those Democrats who support it byproposing a three-prong rate reduction targeted formiddle-income individuals and those who invest in new smallbusinesses.   The lower rates would apply only to individuals, notbusinesses. One provision would allow taxpayers with incomesbelow $100,000 to exclude from taxation 30% of the gains fromthe sale of assets bought at a future date and held for atleast a year. The tax cut would begin to be phased out fortaxpayers with annual income above $100,000, disappearingentirely for those making $150,000 or more. The provisionwouldn't apply to gains from the sale of collectibles.   For existing assets, taxpayers could pay the lower rate ongains up to a lifetime cap of $80,000.   Separately, to encourage investments in small businesses,the proposal would allow an exclusion for 40% of the gainsfrom new stock in companies with gross assets of $100 millionor less. The stock would have to be held at least five yearsbefore it was sold.   Other highlights of the Rostenkowski plan include:   -- A tax credit of as much as $200 an individual and $400a couple annually for two years, based on the taxpayers'payroll-tax liability for Social Security and Medicare. Thetwo-year tax break would cost $45.9 billion. Some committeemembers, notably Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.), want a moregenerous credit for each child that a taxpayer has.   -- A combination of tax increases on upper-incomeindividuals to raise about $75 billion over six years. Mostof that would come from a new fourth tax bracket of 35% forindividuals with taxable income of at least $85,000 andcouples with at least $145,000. Those income thresholds areconsidered too low by a number of Democrats who are fearfulof voting for a tax increase unless it clearly hits only thevery rich. Their fear is compounded by the fact that the taxincreases would be permanent, while the proposed middle-classtax cut ends after two years.   The proposal also calls for a 10% surtax on millionaires,bringing their top rate in effect to about 38%, and anincrease in the alternative minimum tax for individuals to25% from 24%. Existing limits on the deductions and personalexemptions that upper-income taxpayers can take would beextended two years, through 1997.   -- A proposal, like one in Mr. Bush's plan, to allow earlywithdrawals without tax penalty from Individual RetirementAccounts for purchases of a first home, major medical costsor college tuition. Unlike Mr. Bush, Rep. Rostenkowski didn'tpropose a credit for the purchase of a first home; Mr. Bushwants a $5,000 credit, at a cost of $5.2 billion, accordingto Treasury estimates.   -- Another provision borrowed from Mr. Bush to restore the&quot;passive loss&quot; deductions on real estate, but primarily forpeople who have built or renovated properties. Rep.Rostenkowski proposed to offset the $2.4 billion, six-yearcost with a new provision extending the period in whichowners can write off the value of commercial real estate to40 years, up from 31 1/2 years.   -- Permanent extensions of several popular tax breaks forbusiness. The costliest, at $7.8 billion through fiscal 1997,is a tax credit for research and experimentation expenses,also supported by Mr. Bush. Other provisions make permanenttax incentives for low-income housing, mortgage revenuebonds, employer-provided educational aid, and hiring thedisadvantaged.   -- Repeal of a 10% luxury tax on yachts, airplanes,jewelry and furs above certain prices. The tax, approved in1990, has been the subject of furious lobbying by affectedbusinesses, which claim a loss of sales and, in turn, jobs.In a blow to the import-car industry, Rep. Rostenkowskididn't propose to repeal the luxury levy on cars priced above$30,000. Expensive autos account for most of the revenuegenerated by the luxury tax. He did propose to index the$30,000 threshold for inflation, as U.S. car makers wanted;because domestic models generally are less costly than theforeign variety, indexing would exempt many of them from thetax.   -- A requirement, as Mr. Bush proposed, that securitiesinventories be taxed at market value as opposed to theiroriginal cost. That would raise $2.5 billion. Inclusion ofthe proposal was a setback for the securities industry. Incontrast, the draft doesn't include Mr. Bush's proposed taxincreases on annuities and corporate-owned life insurance,also the object of intense lobby opposition.   -- A ban on &quot;double-dipping&quot; by thrifts. This is aimed atstopping purchasers of troubled savings-and-loans from takingdeductions for losses at those institutions that already havebeen made up by the U.S.   -- A new 14-year write-off for &quot;intangible&quot; assets, suchas customer lists or the value of a company's reputation.</TEXT></DOC>
