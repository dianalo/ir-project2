The FMPs were prepared by the NorthPacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the authority of theMagnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) and areimplemented by regulations for the foreign fishery at 50 CFR part 611 andfor the U.S. fishery at 50 CFR parts 672 and 675.At its January 16-19, 1989, meeting, the Council reviewed more than fortyrecommendations submitted by various interested parties for possible amendmentsto the FMPs or to implementing regulations. Four of the suggestions forregulatory changes were adopted by the Council. The first was to establishauthority in the GOA to close directed fisheries prior to the total allowablecatches (TACs) for such fisheries being reached to accommodate incidentalcatch needs. This authority has already been established in the BSAI. Thesecond, third, and fourth suggestions are relevant to both the GOA andBSAI. The second measure would amend regulatory text at andSection; 672.22(a)and (b) and andSection; 675.20(e) to provide for reopening fisheries thathave been closed prematurely if available catch data show that allowableharvest levels have not been reached. The third measure would amend regulatorytext at andSection; 672.23 and establish a new andSection; 675.23 to specify12:00 noon Alaska local time as the starting and ending time for all fishingseasons. The fourth measure would amend regulatory text at andSection; 672.24and establish a new andSection; 675.24 to require fishermen to mark theirgear used in the pot and hook-and-line fisheries. Minor changes to regulationsare described below under ``Other regulatory changes.'' Descriptions of,and reasons for, the proposed measures are described below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Authority to Halt Directed Fishing Before a Species' TAC Is Reached</ITAG>Nine target species including the ``other species'' category, are managedunder regulations implementing the GOA FMP. For each of these target species,TACs are specified by the Secretary by means detailed in the regulations.When the TAC for any target species in any regulatory area or districthad been reached, the Secretary prohibits the retention of that speciestherein, and requires that such species be treated as a prohibited speciesunder andSection; 672.20(e). Except for sable fish under andSection; 672.24(b)(3),no authority exists under 50 CFR part 672 allowing the Secretary to closea fishery for a target species or ``other species'' prior to the TAC beingreached to preserve a portion of the TAC to support incidental catchesin other target fisheries.To date, reaching TACs prematurely has only been a problem in the ``otherrockfish'' and sablefish fisheries. However, the Gulf of Alaska groundfishindustry is expanding rapidly with new catching and processing capacity.The sum of TACs available for harvest in 1989 is 231,966 metric tons (mt),which represents an increase of 34 percent over the total 1988 harvestof 153,882 mt. The likelihood that TACs for other species will be reachedearly in the fishing year is increasing.Setting aside certain amounts of TACs as bycatch to support other targetfisheries may be necessary to avoid waste. Authority is needed to allowthe secretary to close target fisheries early to avoid reaching TACs forthose species/species groups that are caught incidentally in other directedfisheries. Otherwise, the Secretary must allow the TACs to be reached anddeclare additional catches as prohibited species to be discarded at seaas waste. The Secretary proposes, therefore, to allow closure of a fisheryfor a target species or the ``other species'' category prior to its TACbeing reached if deemed appropriate to accommodate bycatch requirements.The amount of TAC left uncaught by the target fishery would then be availableto support bycatch needs in directed fisheries for other groundfish species.The Secretary expects the amount set aside to be sufficient to allow furtherbycatches during the remainder of the fishing year without actually causingthe TAC for the bycatch species/species group to be reached. The Secretary'sdecision shall be based upon the following considerations.(1) The risk of biological harm to the groundfish species being retained.The purpose of this factor is to consider effects on the well-being ofa groundfish species if amounts were to be set aside for bycatch. If afisherey is allowed to harvest the entire TAC for a species prior to theend of the fishing year, additional catches are treated as prohibited speciesand discarded at sea. In allowing this, the Secretary must conclude thatmortality in excess of TAC is consistent with the goals and objectivesof the GOA FMP and will not exceed ABC for that species.(2) Whether a bycatch set aside is required.The purpose of this factor is to consider the level of natural catch rates.In some cases, natural bycatch rates are sufficiently low, resulting ininsignificant amounts of bycatch and thus minimal discard. Setting asidebycatch would be unnecessary. In other cases, where natural bycatch ratesare high, significant amounts of bycatch may be taken thus compelling anotherconclusion.(3) The socioceonomic impact of allocation to bycatch needs.This factor considers the allocative effects of setting aside bycatch.Except for sablefish, GOA groundfish are currently available to all userswithout regard to need. Setting aside bycatch redistributes fishery rights.amounts of bycatch that could have been targeted on by some users mightbe denied to them as a result of a bycatch only declaration. All determinationsabout setting aside bycatch will be consistent with the goals and objectivesof the GOA FMP and reasonably calculated to promote conservation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Authority to Reopen Fisheries to Allow Full Utilization of TACs orGear Shares</ITAG>Regulations for the GOA and BSAI FMPs provide that a fishery will be closedwhen the TAC or gear share of a TAC for that fishery is reached. Currentregulations do not specifically provide authority for the Secretary toreopen a fishery if subsequent catch data show the closure was premature.Premature closures would preclude attainment of optimum yield and thwartefforts to maximize economic returns from the fishery. The Secretary hasdetermined that if fisheries have been closed based on projected catchdata not substantiated by actual catch data, then the fisheries shouldbe reopened. The Secretary, therefore, proposes regulations to specificallyprovide authority to reopen a fishery that had been closed prematurely.<ITAG tagnum="84">New Requirement for Making Hook-and-Line and Pot Gear </ITAG>Enforcement officers must be able to identify the owners of setline orskate gear, including hook-and-line and pot gear, to effectively enforcevarious fishery regulations and locate and return lost or stolen gear.The Secretary, therefore, proposes to require fishermen who are using setlineor skate gear to mark the buoys for such gear to aid in its identification.<ITAG tagnum="84">Openings and Closures of Fishing Seasons at 12:00 Noon Alaska LocalTime </ITAG>Except for the GOA sablefish hook-and-line fishery, which starts at 12:00noon, Alaska local time, the GOA and BSAI groundfish fisheries start at1 minute after midnight on January 1 and are allowed to proceed, subjectto time/area closures until midnight, December 31 of any fishing year.Night time openings are not desirable for two reasons. Competition withinthe fishing fleet, especially in fisheries that might be prosecuted ina short time frame, causes safety problems for fishermen who initiate fishingoperations concurrent with a midnight opening and are burdened by darkness.Bad weather during darkness will worsen the safety conditions. Also, agencyenforcement of the starting and ending times is not practical during darkness,because such enforcement is usually conducted with aircraft to cover asmuch of the fishing area as possible. The Secretary, therefore, proposesto make 12:00 noon, Alaska local time as the starting and ending time forall fishing seasons. <ITAG tagnum="84">Other Regulatory Changes </ITAG>Certain other regulatory changes are proposed to clarify regulations orto bring regulatory sections up to date with other regulatory changes.These changes are as follows: (1) In andSection; 672.2, the terms ``setline'' and ``skate'' are defined.(2) In paragraph (a)(1) of andSection;andSection; 672.5 and 675.5, the phrase,``to which a permit has been issued under this part'' is deleted to removethe link between permit requirements and reporting requirements. As written,a vessel operator who did not have a permit and who also had not compliedwith requirements to submit fish tickets would only be in violation ofnot having a permit. By removing the phrase, he would also be in violationof the fish ticket requirement. (3) Paragraph (b) of andSection; 672.23 is revised to delete reference tosablefish pots, since sablefish pots are no longer a legal gear in theGOA and this regulation serves no purpose. (4) In andSection; 672.24, paragraph (a), <T3>Biodegradable escape panels required for all sablefish pots,</T3> isdeleted for the same reason. <ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined that thisrule is necessary for the conservation and management of the groundfishfishery off Alaska and that it is consistent with the Magnuson Act andother applicable law. The Alaska Region, NMFS, prepared an EA for this rule that discusses theimpact on the human environment that will occur as a result of this rule.You may obtain a copy of the EA/RIR/IRFA from the Regional Director atthe address above. The Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, NOAA, (Under Secretary)determined that this proposed rule is not a ``major rule'' requiring aregulatory impact analysis under Executive Order 12291. This determinationis based on the socioeconomic impacts discussed in the EA/RIR/IRFA preparedby the Alaska Region, NMFS. The General Counsel has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, SmallBusiness Administration, that this proposed rule, if adopted, would nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.The effects that have been identified, would in general, be positive. Authorityto close a fishery before a TAC is reached to provide for subsequent incidentalcatch amounts in other target fisheries is superior to the status quo becauseit would reduce unnecessary waste of valuable resources by allowing theretention of species that would otherwise have to be discarded; and wouldminimize total fishing mortality and promote fishery conservation of groundfishresources by accounting for incidental catch amounts within establishedTACs. Authority to allow reopening of fisheries that had been closed prematurelyis superior to the status quo, since Secretarial direction would be clearlyspecified and provision for fully utilizing available TACs would be fostered.A requirement that fishermen mark their setline and skate gear is superiorto the status quo, because owners could be informed about lost gear andenforcement of closed fishing areas could be facilitated. A 12:00 noonopening and closing time for all groundfish fisheries is superior to thestatus quo, because fishermen would be working under safer conditions duringdaylight and enforcement of openings and closures would be facilitated.This rule does not contain a collection of information requirement subjectto the Paperwork Reduction Act. NOAA has determined that this rule will be implemented in a manner thatis consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the approved coastalzone management program of the State of Alaska. This determination hasbeen submitted for review by the responsible State agencies under Section307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act.This proposed rule does not contain policies with federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment under Executiveorder 12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Parts 672 and 675</ITAG>Fisheries, Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 11, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
