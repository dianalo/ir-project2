Under the licensing agreement, GynoMed Pharmaceutical Inc., Somerville, N.J., will closely monitor the device's use. The closely held company that does research on gynecological products said it hopes to begin selling the device early next year.    Intrauterine devices, or IUDs, have almost disappeared from use in this country since 1986 after the two major IUD marketers withdrew their products from sale. IUDs have been associated with genital infections and their use had resulted in a high rate of liability lawsuits.    In 1985, Ortho Pharmaceutical, a unit of New Brunswick, N.J.-based Johnson andamp; Johnson, stopped selling its Lippes Loop IUD. And in 1986, G.D. Searle, a unit of Monsanto Co., St. Louis, withdrew its big-selling copper IUDs. Only Alza Corp., Palo Alto, Calif., currently makes and sells an IUD in the U.S.    In 1984, the Population Council, a nonprofit group that addresses birth-control issues, received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market an improved copper-type IUD and licensed Searle to offer it. But Searle dropped plans to market the device after withdrawing from the field.    As part of the newly announced licensing agreement, GynoMed will recommend strongly that doctors don't provide the new IUD to women under 25, to women who haven't had children, or to women who aren't in &quot;an exclusive, monogamous relationship.&quot; Such women have a higher-than-normal risk of developing infections that may damage their reproductive tract, according to recent studies.    Users also will be asked to fill out a lengthy informed-consent form that advises them of possible risks. Alza uses a similar approach in marketing its product, called Progestasert. </TEXT></DOC>
