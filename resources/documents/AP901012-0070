If not, the military option is there.... We must be ready for any contingency,'' she said in her keynoteaddress, winding up the Tories' four-day annual conference.   Amid applause from the 5,000 delegates, Mrs. Thatcher also saidIraqi President Saddam Hussein must face war crimes charges, payreparation for the devastation of Kuwait and be stripped of powerto mount new attacks.   ``This tyrant has taken our people hostage,'' she said. ``Youget him out, make him pay and see that he is never in a position todo these things again.''   Mrs. Thatcher spoke a day after Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurdsaid the international community must assess within weeks whethersanctions are working -and whether only force can end Saddam's Aug.2 invasion of Kuwait.   Mrs. Thatcher praised President Bush for taking the lead in thegulf crisis, adding: ``In times of great crisis, Britain and theUnited States stand as always together.''   She focused most of her keynote address on trying to rally theparty, which, despite promises of better economic times ahead, isrunning out of time to reverse its long lag in opinion pollratings.   On Britain's relations with the rest of the 12-nation EuropeanCommunity - the issue that is dividing her Cabinet - she wasadament that she will fight plans for economic integration with asingle currency.   ``Europe cannot be built by ... trying to turn us into regionsrather than nations,'' she declared.   Mrs. Thatcher's personal ratings have been boosted by the gulfcrisis and the fresh life that her swift dispatch of British forceshas given to the Anglo-American relationship. Britain had seemedovershadowed by the emergence of a reunified Germany as thedominant West European power.   Still, the conference has produced signs of anxiety that after11 years in power, the Conservatives are running out of new ideas.   ``We have to avoid looking like custodians of a finishedprocess, designers whose work is done,'' declared Sir GeoffreyHowe, the deputy prime minister.   Security has been extraordinarily tight at the meeting toprevent a possible IRA attack.   On Thursday night, police arrested a woman found with twogasoline bombs in a parking lot 200 yards from the conferencecenter and hotel where Mrs. Thatcher is staying. However, policespokesman Brian Jones said: ``This was definitely not a terroristattack.''   He said the middle-aged woman appeared mentally disturbed. Shewas spotted with the devices - milk bottles containing gasoline -by a police patrol. One bottle had exploded and the other was stillintact. There was no damage.   The convention center and Mrs. Thtcher's Hycliff Hotel areringed by a six-foot spiked fence as part unprecedented securityamid new fears of an assassination attempt by the outlawed IrishRepublican Army.   The IRA, fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland,killed a Conservative Party legislator in July and attempted tokill a government minister last month.   At the 1984 Conservative conference, IRA guerrillas blew up Mrs.Thatcher's hotel, killing five party members.</TEXT></DOC>
