Every year, as sure as Mother Nature changes season, floods,droughts, insects and diseases chew away at crops that farmfamilies and the rest of the country depend on.   And each year, as sure as politicians like to get re-elected,Congress comes up with plans to bail out farmers.   Economist Joe Glauber is head of an Agriculture Department teamstudying ways to change the current federal crop insurance program,which provides catastrophic risk coverage for farmers.   But Glauber, who works for the department's Economic ResearchService, says there is a perception among many farmers that ``ifthere is a widespread natural disaster, Congress will legislate''one-time assistance to help the affected producers.   Experience since 1980 has proved the perception correct.   A General Accounting Office study released last month showedthat the government spent $17.6 billion from 1980 to 1988 on aid tofarmers who lost crops because of drought or other natural causes.   The GAO report, which was requested by a House agriculturesubcommittee, said only about 25 percent of farmers buy federalcrop insurance because they expect Congress to come to their rescuewhenever there is a major crisis.   As a result of last year's drought, for example, about $4billion in direct payments went to farmers under the DisasterAssistance Act of 1988. An additional $900 million will go tofarmers under a 1989 version.   The GAO said that in the 1980-88 period, USDA spent $6.9 billionon direct assistance to farmers suffering crop losses, $6.4 billionon emergency loan programs and $4.3 billion on subsidies for cropinsurance.   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., chairman of the subcommittee, said65 percent to 70 percent participation would be necessary to makethe USDA crop insurance program successful.   Government crop insurance (there is a Federal Crop InsuranceCorp. in USDA to handle it) goes back decades. Congress overhauledthe program in 1980 and for a while there was a widely acceptedbelief that crop insurance should replace disaster assistance.   But record losses to the program and low participation byfarmers have shown otherwise. So, as Congress gets deeply involvedin writing an omnibus 1990 farm bill, crop insurance is one of themajor challenges.   One of the major changes in 1980 was an extensive expansion offederal coverage. Before the 1980 act, the program operated only inselected counties and for selected crops. Farmers paid the fullcost of premiums, and increases in enrollment were slow because ofrestrictions on selling the insurance in high-risk areas.   But the 1980 law permitted the USDA agency to insure any farmcommodity grown in the United States if yield histories for thearea were available. The program was handled as much as possible byprivate companies.   To encourage greater participation, the law allowed a 30 percentsubsidy of premiums for policies that guarantee farmers 50 percentor 65 percent of their normal yields, and a somewhat smallersubsidy if 75 percent guarantees are selected.   In the USDA study, economist Glauber's team looked at fouralternatives to the current system, including compulsory cropinsurance for farmers enrolled in federal commodity programs thatprovide price supports and other benefits. Another plan would makecompulsory crop insurance free to farmers.   The third alternative would replace crop insurance with apermanent disaster payment program, and the fourth would provide a``catastrophic risk management'' program tied to commodity programsand based on target revenues.   A report in this month's Farmline magazine looks at the Glauberstudy, including pros and cons of each.   High participation by farmers in the commodity support programswould ``ensure high participation in crop insurance'' under thecompulsory package, Glauber found. It also would negate the needfor disaster assistance for crop producers.   ``There is, however, a chance that compulsory crop insurancemight have little effect toward meeting the government's goal ofeliminating ad hoc congressionally legislated disasterassistance,'' the report added.   Even so, the study found that total costs to the governmentunder the compulsory option would likely be less than the combinedcost of the current program and ad hoc assistance provided byCongress.   Free crop insurance could boost farmer participation in annualcommodity programs, meaning government costs would increase forprice support operations   A permanent disaster assistance program to replace cropinsurance would be the most expensive of all, possibly exceedingthe $4 billion paid to farmers in 1988, Glauber found.   Looking at the target revenue option, the chief attraction wouldbe income stability for farmers, he said. The program would replaceboth the crop insurance and the direct subsidy, or deficiencypayment, used in the annual commodity programs.   Depending on the specifics, federal costs of a target revenueprogram could soar by more than 30 percent from current levels,Glauber said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 8</NOTE></DOC>
