(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>X3, the primary U.S.andP;  body for computer industry standards, has becomeoverwhelmed and inefficient.andP;  Is X3 giving way to more effective standardsbodies or is the standards-making process itself getting out of control?andM;You have to feel sorry for Don Deutsch.andP;  Over the last few years, the isdirector at GTE Information Services has devoted countless hours to whatamounts to his second job as chairman of the committee developing theStructured Query Language (SQL) standard in the United States.andP;  As SQL andrelational technology have increased in importance, so Deutsch has seen hiscommittee grow from about 20 members in 1986 to over 65 today.andP;  Now Deutschis supposed to lead this unwieldy group of users and competing vendors in itsattempt to meet an impatient industry's demands for a standard governing avast array of new SQL features.andM;By any measure, the efforts of Deutsch and his committee have beenimpressive.andP;  In less than four years they have created a 750-page blueprintfor turning the current limited American National Standards Institute (ANSI)SQL standard into the database language of the 1990s and beyond.andP;  &quot;I'd giveus an A for speed,&quot; says Deutsch.andP;  &quot;We want to get the new standard out therein a time frame that will allow all vendors to implement new features in theways we've described.&quot;andM;And what thanks have Deutsch and his committee gotten for their efforts,dubbed SQL-2 and SQL-3? Answers relational database management system pioneerMichael Stonebraker, &quot;As language designers, a 60-person committee is aguaranteed walking time bomb.andP;  What they have come up with is techniallyinept, often not well thought out and  not  nearly  aggressive enough.... Thevendors of SQL systems are rapidly, completely overrunning the standardsprocess.andP;  The standards guys should just go have a coffee for two or threeyears.andP;  Do nothing.andP;  Wait for the aggressive vendors to try out the goodideas ...andP;  then try the political process of putting a bunch of incompatibleimplementations back together.&quot;andM;Stonebraker is not alone in his harsh opinion.andP;  Adds database consultant jeffTasch: &quot;There's a sense in the market that they [the committee] blew it.&quot;andM;In fact, there's a growing sense in the information technology industry thatit's not just the SQL committee that may be blowing it.andP;  The problem goesmuch deeper, to the heart of the formal standards-making process itself, manysay.andM;A growing number of users and vendors say the 30-year-old accredited basestandards-making organization in the United States--the X3 AccreditedStandards Committee for Information Processing Systems--is facing a midlifecrisis.andM;Faced with the rapidly accelerating pace of technological change,intensifying demand for standards from vendors and users, competition from anexpanding number of standards consortia and a unifying European IT community,X3 is coming under increasing pressure to change or risk losing itsleadership position in the worldwide standards arena.andP;  The emergence ofgroups such as the Network Management Forum, SQL Access Group, the OpenSoftware Foundation and X/Open Co. Ltd. are competing with X3 and making theprocess more chaotic.andM;Even the people who manage the group's 80 technical committees, 600 projectsand 3,200 volunteers admit that X3 must somehow begin to develop standardsmore quickly, draw users into the process, work with the consortia anddevelop a unified international voice.andP;  If it doesn't, observers warn, X3risks becoming increasingly irrelevant.andM;If you had asked rive years ago who is the premier IT standards developer,there would have been no question that it was X3,&quot; says Michael B. Spring, aprofessor at the University of Pittsburgh's information science departmentwho specializes in standards.andP;  Although X3 still accounts for about 90% ofthe accredited standards-making activity in the United States, Spring says,&quot;I think if you ask that question today, some people would say IEEE [TheInstitute of Electrical an Electronics Engineers Inc.] or something else.andO;The fact of the matter is, we have in the U.S.andP;  today a competitive situationwith respect to standards development; X3 is no longer the only game intown.&quot;andM;Getting Acquainted With CompetitionandM;The idea of competition is new for X3.andP;  Even though it was founded in 1960 inresponse to the International Standards Organization's (ISO) creation of thefirst technical committee focused on IT, for years X3 led in thestandardization of such bedrock technologies as COBOL, FORTRAN, computergraphics, data communications and disk interfaces.andP;  In the 1960s, 1970s andeven the early 1980s, X3's technical committees, composed mainly of engineersfrom interested vendors, could afford to spend months or even years incollegial technical comparisons of existing product implementations beforereaching a consensus on a proposed standard.andP;  X3, through ANSI, would thenpropose the X3 standard to international bodies such as the ISO where theywere invariably accepted, often with little input from the lesswell-organized European standards community.andP;  In those days, much  the workwas done far away from public view, with relatively little pressure.andM;This situation has changed rather suddenly.andP;  As de facto industry standardssuch as UNIX emerged in the mid-1980s, convincing users and vendors to takethe promise of open systems and interoperability seriously, standards becamebig business.andP;  Major vendors such as NCR Corp. and Unisys Corp. built theirstrategies around open systems and standards, and new vendors such as SunMicrosystems Inc. and Oracle Corp. promised to use industry standardtechnologies to deliver innovative new computing architectures such asclient-server computing and distributed, cooperative processing.andP;  Suddenly,vendors were flooding the key X3 technical groups like the SQL committee withtheir representatives and applying pressure for establishing new standardsmore quickly.andP;  Officials at the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers' Association (CBEMA), which serves as the administrative arm ofX3, estimate that X3 participants-mostly vendors-spent $50 million trying tohammer out formal standards in 1989.andP;  That figure is expected to grow bybetween 20 and 30% annually.andM;So rapidly are vendors pushing the technology and demanding new standardsthat X3 and its voluntary consensus-based process are having a hard timekeeping up.andP;  For example, X3 had not yet approved its new C language standardwhen, late last year, vendors and users were clamoring for newobject-oriented extensions called C++, and X3 responded by initiating a newproject.andM;&quot;We write a base standard, and then we realize there's new technology thatneeds to be incorporated,&quot; says Don Loughry, X3's vice chairman and astandards manager at Hewlett-Packard Co. &quot;Almost before the ink is dry on one[new standard], we are now writing the standard to replace it.andP;  That didn'thappen 10 years ago.andP;  I t was all sequential--and much slower paced.andP;  Today,it's much more parallel, much faster.&quot;andM;As a result, users and vendors seeking to accelerate the process of turningbase standards into useful products have begun working outside X3 and theformal standards-making process.andP;  Over the last couple of years, they haveformed a growing number of standards consortia--small groups  ;f vendors andusers focused on new technologies or  aspects of the standards process thathave been overlooked by the slower moving formal standards organization.andO;These consortia say they are concentrating on aspects of standardization thatX3 has avoided, such as conformance testing and application-specific implementation profiles like the Government OSI Profile (GOSIP) ana theManufacturing Automation Protocol/Technical Office Protocol (MAP/TOP).andM;Standard TemptationsandM;But many longtime X3 participants fear that the consortia, tired of waitingfor X3 to set new base standards, will inevitably be tempted to begin settingnew base standards themselves.andP;  X/Open, for example, is now attempting tostandardize on a graphical user interface (GUI) standard long before X3committees have developed even a draft GUI standard.andP;  Many experts feel suchpreemptive standard-setting by consortia could splinter U.S.andP;  standardsefforts.andP;  It could also further weaken the role of X3 both in the UnitedStates and internationally.andM;Many consortium officials are aware of the risks they are running inbypassing the formal standards process.andP;  But they say they have no choicebecause users and vendors won't take  wait&quot; for an answer.andM;&quot;We get a lot of frustration from [users] who say, 'Where's my GUI standard?andO;You guys aren't doing anything,' &quot; says George Shaffner, chief marketingofficer for X/Open.andP;  Or, as Object Management Group president Chris Stoneresponds when asked why he chose to form a consortium rather than work withinX3: &quot;Because I want to get it [the standard] out before I die.&quot;andM;As a result, cooperation between the consortia and X3 has been rare.andP;  &quot;Someof the consortia came in pretty ignorant about the standards community, andthe standards community in some cases has been pretty ignorant about ...andP;  theconsortia,&quot; says X3's Loughry.andP;  &quot;They [the consortia] were viewed as athreat, clearly.&quot;andM;Even if the consortia fulfill their promise not to compete with X3's basestandards-making process, they pose a threat.andP;  Within vendor and userorganizations, X3 and the consortia increasingly compete for resources.andO;Users have always been hard-pressed to justify spending the kind of moneyneeded to participate directly in a standards development process that maytake years to reap useful products.andP;  Now even large vendors are feeling thefinancial pinch from sending top technical talent to an ever-expanding numberof standards consortia as well as to X3 technical and management committees.andO;Over 200 Unisys engineers, for example, spend time on standards committees.andO;That number has  ne u 50% in the last two years.andP;  Between 30 and 500 DigitalEquipment Corp. engineers work on standards at any given time.andM;&quot;These are the best engineers we have,&quot; says Carl Cargill, Digital's managerof standards.andP;  &quot;We can't afford that.andP;  If we can't clone these people, thenwe've got to start acting smarter.andM;A growing number of people inside X3 and the formal standards community arenow trying to do just that.andP;  Worried by signs that the standards process inthe United States  may be splintering just as its European  counterpart isbecoming stronger through unification, the federal government, through theNational Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), recently sponsoredthree days of hearings focused on whether the government should take a moreactive role in coordinating and streamlining the U.S.andP;  standards efforts.andP;  Atthe same time, CBEMA has quietly floated a proposal to merge the X3organization with the joint technical committee responsible for U.S.andO;positions on international standards, including those from non-X3 groups suchas the IEEE.andP;  And C3 itself has begun a major Strategic self-evaluation.andO;X3's Strategic Planning Committee is taking a critical look at the standardsdevelopment life cycle used today and how it should be changed.andP;  The group isfocused on how X3 can embrace the consortia and users and on how it can speedup the standards-making process.andM;&quot;We're trying to get a sense of what the real process is so we can find outwhere things are breaking down,&quot; says Kate Howells, manager for computingstandards at The Boeing Co., one of a handful of user organizations involvedin the project.andP;  &quot;I don't think we really know where things  are breakingdown right now.&quot;andM;But standards experts have some clues.andP;  It's true that technical committeeshave grown larger and political battles have become more intense as vendorand user interest in standards and open systems has grown.andP;  But that's onlypart of the problem.andP;  Experts say the fundamental nature of IT standards haschanged in two important ways in recent years.andM;First, base standards can no longer be viewed--as they once were--as isolatedislands of technology, independent from one another and from the eventualuser.andP;  Several of the consortia--x/open and OSF, for example--have beencreated to integrate otherwise stand-alone base standards.andP;  And users such asBell operating company U.S.andP;  West Communications are pushing for basestandards that enable Interoperability across environments.andM;We see our telecom network and our data network eventually coming together,&quot;says Gary Dempsey, director of advanced technologies for the Englewood,Colo., carrier.andP;  For that we need complementary architectures that arecompatible.andP;  The two sides must be able to share things and both understandthings like SQL, RDA [Remote Data Access] and IRDS [Information ResourceDictionary System.]&quot;andM;The second major change for base standards developers is that, becausetechnology is advancing so rapidly, they often no longer have the luxury ofstarting off with a handful of proven, tested products from which to form astandard.andP;  Instead, as users and vendors push for new standards faster, X3committees are often working from a blank sheet of paper, expected toanticipate fundamental issues such as user requirements and basic productdesign.andM;Those two trends have rendered base standards development considerably morecomplex.andP;  &quot;We have a new culture developing,&quot; asserts Loughry.andP;  &quot;We have asea of users out there that do indeed want to take advantage of newtechnologies.andP;  They want the latest and greatest [products], and they wantthem to be standard.... Now we have many things to choose from.andP;  Which onesshould be standard? Which ones are really proprietary? Which ones need towork together? What does X Windows have to work with? So the picture is justever so much more complex than it was even five years ago.&quot;andM;The SQL committee is an example of both major changes.andP;  When the groupstarted out in the mid-1980s, several implementations of SQL were already onthe market, including one from IBM.andP;  &quot;We just chose from between the existingproducts to establish a least common denominator standard,&quot; rememberscommitteeandM;chairman Deutsch.andM;At that time, the committee did not go out of its way to link the SQLstandard to other existing or evolving standards.andP;  So, for example, thestandard did not spell out how to link or bind ANSI SQL to ANSI COBOL.andO;SQL-1, like many standards of its day, described an isolated, discretetechnology.andP;  Additions to SOLandM;But SQL-2 and SQL-3 were another matter.andP;  With the follow-on efforts, thecommittee set out to standardize SQL's links to COBOL and other standardenvironments like Ada, C, FORTRAN, Pascal and PL-1.andP;  At the same time, thecommittee entered the uncharted realm of adding major new functions to SQL,many of which had yet to be incorporated into more than a handful of the mostadvanced products on the market.andP;  Such features included a date/time datatype, a trigger system and dynamic SQL.andM;In attempting to identify and adopt these new features the SQL committee hascome in for its harshest criticism.andP;  Critics like Stonebraker say thecommittee has included in its draft standard functions that users don't want.andO;At the same time, they contend, the committee has all but ignored issues likeobject-oriented and interoperable databases.andM;Committee members such as Oracle database marketing director Ken Jacobs sayit's easy and irresponsible for outsiders like Stonebraker to criticize thecommittee's work.andP;  But, insists Stonebraker, &quot;Ever since the committee triedto shift into a mode of anticipating what the industry wants, it's gonestraight down the tubes.&quot;andM;To many observers, it's not surprising that some X3 efforts have wanderedinto trouble in this new era of standards.andP;  X3 committees working on newtechnologies from remote procedure calls to network management are inessentially the same boat as the SQL committee: they are trying to build astandard where few commercial products yet exist.andP;  Even some consortiumofficials fear the risks of navigating where there are few, if any, familiarlandmarks to guide them.andM;&quot;One of the things that keeps me awake at night is the idea of having X/Opengo out and say,  This is the standard,' then having a whole bunch of vendorsspend lots of money developing it, and then have it hit the market andwatching it fall flat on its face,&quot; says X/Open's Shaffner.andP;  &quot;These productsdon't even exist yet, and we're all being asked to develop standards forthem.&quot;andM;X/Open officials, and many of the reformers inside X3, say the formalstandards organization must significantly change the way it does business.andO;One of the obvious things it must do, many say, is get users and theconsortia directly involved in the process.andM;An Uncomfortable Fit for UsersandM;Many users who have tried to participate directly in X3 committees have foundit difficult to fit into the process.andP;  At Chicago oil giant Amoco Corp., forexample, is planning officials convinced their management to let them jointhe X3 SQL committee four years ago in an effort to leverage the influencethe company could have on the design of SQL products from a number ofvendors.andP;  For three years, Amoco sent some of its top data managementtechnicians to about six committee meetings a year, at a cost of about $1,200per meeting.andP;  Amoco submitted proposals for 10 features it wanted to see inthe new SQL standard.andP;  Six of them were accepted.andM;Last year, however, just as the X3 SQL committee set out to decide on the newSQL-2 and SQL-3 features that should be implemented, Amoco IS managementdecided to pull out of the committee.andM;&quot;We were unable to convince management that the process still had enoughrelevance to us to continue,&quot; says Alan Hirsch, Amoco's representative on thecommittee.andM;Some longtime X3 participants say that that kind of user experience isunavoidable.andP;  The truth is that, although we are now involved more inanticipatory standards, the process really hasn't changed greatly.andP;  But whatwe have now is pretty much the only way it will work given the constraints ofour organizational structure in the U.S.,&quot; says SQL committee chairmanDeutsch.andP;  &quot;All vendors are there representing their best understanding ofuser requirements, anyway.&quot;andM;Some users, however, say that's not good enough.andP;  Users like Michael A.andO;Kaminski, General Motors Corp.'s manager for computer-integratedmanufacturing (CIM) and networking technology, say X3 committees need to getrequirement definitions directly from users.andP;  And users need to have anongoing place on the technical committees.andM;&quot;The process is much too slow, and part of the reason is that the committeesare composed for the most part of vendors who have a base of products toprotect, be it SNA [IBM's Systems Network Architecture] or something else&quot;says Kaminski.andM;At least one consortium and a user group are currently defining a newstandards role for users that Kaminski and others think could serve as amodel for X3.andP;  The Corporation for Open Systems (COS), a consortium focusedon the certification and testing of standard profiles, recently joined forceswith the Information Technology Requirements Council (ITRC), an OSI-focuseduser group best known for defining the MAP/TOP profile.andP;  ITRC members,including Deere andamp; Co., E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. and General DynamicsCorp., have become COS members and formed what the group calls a&quot;requirements interest group.&quot; The first requirements interest group willhelp COS' technical committees understand the detailed technical requirementsof MAP/TOP manufacturing users.andM;COS officials say they intend to add requirements interest groups from otherindustrial areas such as financial services, utilities and airlines.andP;  Alreadyat least one other user group, a recently formed collection of aerospace, oiland other companies known as the &quot;Houston 30,&quot; is considering joining COS asone or more requirements interest groups.andM;&quot;Users are looking to leverage their common interests and influence standardsdevelopment,&quot; says Bud Huber, manager of advanced networks integration atHughes Aircraft Co. and a member of the Houston 30.andP;  &quot;The changes beingdiscussed by X3 are just a part of this trend.&quot;andM;Where Users Fit inandM;So far, however, X3 hasn't come up with a plan for bringing users into thebase standards-making process.andP;  But some in the organization are working onit.andP;  As a result of its review of the standards development life cycle, X3'stwo-year-old Strategic Planning Committee is expected to issue a report soonthat suggests ways to carve out roles in the X3 process specifically forusers and the consortia.andM;&quot;We're trying to ask, 'How can we get more things done with the resources wehave?' rather than fighting over turf,&quot; says U.S.andP;  West's Dempsey, who isalso a member of the Strategic Planning Committee.andP;  &quot;If users or theconsortia can push standards further, then bring what they've done back tothe [X3] community, we'll all come out ahead.andP;  &quot;andM;But there may be resistance to proposals to change the X3 standardsdevelopment process.andP;  Some X3 members already have questioned the value ofmandating that X3 technical committees seek out and list user requirementsbefore starting their work, according to Strategic Planning Committeechairman Steve Oksala, who is also director of corporate standards at Unisys.andM;And there also seems to be resistance to other major organizational changesbeing proposed by CBEMA and NIST.andP;  For example, CBEMA's proposal to combineX3 with the U.S.andP;  group that oversees interaction with the internationalstandards community has met with a lukewarm reception from officials at bothX3 and the IEEE.andM;CBEMA president John Pickett feels that merging the groups would streamlinethe process of setting base standards by improving communications and cuttingdown on duplicate meetings.andP;  It could also allow U.S.andP;  standards groups topresent more unified positions to international standards groups like theISO.andM;But X3 chairman Dick Gibson of ATandamp;T, while withholding a final recommendationon the proposal, says he doubts it would do much good.andP;  &quot;Putting the groupstogether isn't going to yield a tremendous amount  of reduction.... In termsof dramatic change, you're not going to get that,&quot; he says.andM;Most of the U.S.andP;  standards community seems to have turned a cold shoulder toNIST's suggestion that the federal government step in to coordinate basestandards development.andP;  The proposal was prompted by NIST's concern that theunification of European standards forces and the adoption by some Europeangovernments of standards-based certification testing could place U.S.andP;  ITvendors at a competitive disadvantage.andP;  NIST proposed establishing what itcalled a Standards Council of the United States of America to coordinate U.S.andO;efforts to qualify and register standards certification.andM;Still, many observers are convinced that X3 and the rest of the U.S.andO;accreditation community will eventually be forced to submit to a majoroverhaul.andM;&quot;I have no doubt that anybody who is involved with standards at any level ofintensity understands there's a need for changing the process,&quot; says theUniversity of Pittsburgh's Spring.andP;  &quot;If X3 is not going to be responsive towhat needs to be done, somebody else is going to take over and develop thesestandards.&quot;andM;One Group That's Working WellandM;Not all formal base standards-setting organizations seem to be struggling tofind ways to integrate users and consortia into the process and keep up withdemands for establishing standards more quickly.andP;  At least one organization,the IEEE POSIX (The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.andO;Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX) Working Group, in just fiveyears, built an impressive record for responding to user and vendorrequirements rapidly and working with standards consortia.andM;Established in 1985, the IEEE POSIX Working Group has been attempting todefine a set of open operating system interface standards.andP;  The goal has beento allow programmers to develop to a standard set of interfaces that wouldallow programs to work with any number of compliant operating systems.andM;The effort has enjoyed strong user participation and extensive support fromstandards consortia, and the group has made significant progress in gettingPOSIX accepted as an international standard.andP;  Already, POSIX--which consistsof two parts: system interface, and shell and tools--has progressed to thepoint where the International Standards Organization has proposed a draftinternational standard.andP;  Groups like the Digital Equipment Computer UsersSociety (DECUS), the 120,000-member user group for Digital Equipment Corp.andO;products, have helped in defining POSIX requirements.andP;  And consortia such asX/Open Co. Ltd. and the Open Software Foundation have included POSIX supportin their open architectures.andP;  The National Institute of Standards andTechnology has based a proposed Federal Information Processing Standard(FIPS) on the POSIX standard.andM;IEEE officials and others say one reason the POSIX Working Group has beensuccessful is because it has been able to attract strong user involvement.andO;According to Paul Borrill, the IEEE Computer Society's vice president forstandards, many users feel more effective on the POSIX technical committeebecause, under IEEE rules, all voting is done on an individual rather than aninstitutional basis.andP;  &quot;The users get the same vote as the manufacturers inthe meetings,&quot; says Borrill.andM;IEEE groups such as the POSIX Working Group have also been more willing thanX3 committees to tackle the complex issue of conformance testing.andP;  While thePOSIX Working Group does not certify conformance to the standard, it hasformed a project to create a standard methodology for testing conformance tothe POSIX standards.andP;  Groups such as NIST are now using those guidelines tocreate conformance tests.andM;Some observers say the success of the IEEE POSIX Working Group shows that theformal standards process can be made to work even in a rapidly changingstandards environment.andP;  &quot;The standards need to be developed closest to theend user,&quot; says the University  of Pittsburgh's Michael B. Spring, aprofessor in the information sciences department.andP;  &quot;IEEE is doing that.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
