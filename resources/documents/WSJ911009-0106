A month after Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev'sannouncement that he is withdrawing a Soviet brigade fromCuba, U.S. officials are concluding that the step is part ofa far broader Soviet pullback. The officials say Kremlinactions as well as private messages from Moscow suggest thatSoviet economic aid is being phased out, military aid isbeing sharply reduced and the corps of Soviet technicaladvisers on the island is going to dwindle.</LP><TEXT>   But the Soviets apparently aren't yet pulling back at oneimportant outpost: their enormous communications interceptionfacility at Lourdes, just outside Havana. There isn't anysign of a drawdown of the 2,100 Soviet intelligence officersand technicians at that state-of-the-art listening post, U.S.officials say. And Americans outside the government who havediscussed the matter privately with Soviet officials say theSoviets indicate they intend, for now at least, to try tohang on to the facility, from which they can interceptmilitary, diplomatic and commercial communications.   The key question may be whether Cuban leader Fidel Castrowill agree to let the facility operate -- and at what price-- when he's losing benefits in every other area of hisrelationship with Moscow.   As other parts of the Cuban-Soviet relationship retreat tocold, commercial terms, Mr. Castro seems likely to demandsome payoff from Moscow for allowing Lourdes to keepoperating. Whether the Soviets can keep Lourdes running inthe long run probably &quot;depends on how much they want to pay,&quot;says Nestor Sanchez, a former senior Pentagon official whotracks Latin American affairs. &quot;They are saying now that ifthe price gets too high, they're going to get out. They'renot going to let themselves be blackmailed by Fidel.&quot;   With the Soviet empire disintegrating and the Cold Warending, the communications that Soviet and republic leaderswill most want to monitor in the future don't involve U.S.military activities. Rather, most analysts agree, the Sovietsprobably will be most interested in monitoring messages aboutWestern commercial activities, in an effort to gathereconomic intelligence that might be useful as the SovietUnion and its republics struggle to compete in the worldmarket.   Lourdes is &quot;the largest such facility in the world,&quot; saysKenneth deGraffenreid, who oversaw intelligence programs as aNational Security Council official in the Reaganadministration. &quot;Its location makes it ideal.&quot;   The Soviets aren't being specific in their public commentsabout Lourdes or other aspects of the Cuban relationship. Aspokesman at the Soviet embassy here says only that there isa &quot;reconsideration in all areas&quot; under way.   Economics, of course, is driving the reconsideration. Theweakened Soviet central government resembles a one-timephilanthropist looking for a graceful way to cut off hischarities because his own cash flow has dried up. Thatposture grew significantly more pronounced when the Augustcoup in Moscow failed. Cuba's most ardent defenders weredriven from office, and power flowed to leaders of Sovietrepublics -- particularly Russian leader Boris Yeltsin -- whoprofess no interest in sending scarce resources to farawayclient states.   Mr. Gorbachev's announcement of the withdrawal of a Soviet&quot;training brigade&quot; is the most concrete public move theSoviets have made to realign the relationship. Moscow willremove from Cuba about 2,800 Cuban soldiers and an estimated1,400 dependents. The brigade, U.S. officials say, neverreally trained Cubans but did its own training and performedother functions, such as protecting the Lourdes facility.   In other ways, the Soviet military relationship alreadyhas been winding down. Pentagon officials say they haven'tspotted any Soviet ships or military aircraft in Cuba sinceJune 1990.   At the same time, one government analyst says, the U.S.has seen this year for the first time a &quot;substantial drop&quot; inSoviet military aid to Cuba. The aid had run at a level ofabout $1.5 billion in recent years, and included a deliveryof six advanced MiG-29 jets last year. But now the Sovietsseem to have suspended outstanding military deliveries, andU.S. analysts think the 1,200 Soviet military adviserseventually will be reduced to what one calls &quot;a handful.&quot;   It seems likely that the Soviets will maintain somemilitary ties with Cuba, though they probably will focus onsupplying parts to keep existing equipment operating. &quot;Theyare talking about continuing some kind of a relationship,maybe not having troops but by providing spare parts and someaid,&quot; says Jaime Suchlicki, a Cuba analyst at the North/SouthCenter at the University of Miami.   It's believed that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister ValeryNikolayenko outlined the new Soviet military relationshipwhen he visited Havana in late September. Even before thatvisit, the Cubans knew their economic aid from the SovietUnion was starting to evaporate. Soviet economic assistance-- in the form of subsidized prices for Cuban sugar tradedfor Soviet oil -- ran just under $4 billion as recently as1990. But a new economic agreement between Cuba and theSoviet Union drives that figure down to $2.5 billion thisyear if the agreement is fully implemented. And U.S. analyststhink the agreement isn't being fully carried out, meaningthe effective Soviet subsidy could fall as low as $1.5billion.   In addition, U.S. officials believe the Cubans have beenput on notice that, because of the realignment wrought by thecoup attempt, they now will have to negotiate trade dealswith individual republics.   It's likely that the Soviet republics will continue totake a large amount of Cuban sugar to meet their enormousdemand, and that Cuba will continue to acquire Soviet oil intrade for that sugar. But the Soviets have made clear thatthose trades will be made at world market prices, notsubsidized rates.   The number of Soviet civilian advisers and technicians,now estimated at 1,200, already is falling, and it isn'tlikely that a nuclear power plant being built with Soviethelp will be finished any time soon.   That leaves the Lourdes facility as the one big unaffectedpiece of the old Soviet-Cuban &quot;special relationship.&quot; TheLourdes facility was begun in the 1960s and has been upgradedperiodically in the years since. Cuba itself has a companionlistening post nearby, but U.S. analysts believe the greatbulk of the information gathered at Lourdes is for Sovietuse.   For U.S. policy makers, the shrinking of the Soviet-Cubanrelationship poses some delicate policy questions. Alreadysome Latin American leaders are urging the U.S. to relax itseconomic embargo of Cuba in response to the changes -- andsome in the U.S. undoubtedly will argue for the same thing toprevent an exodus of Cubans from pouring into Florida toescape Cuba's economic malaise.   But for his part, President Bush is dismissing calls for achange in policy toward Cuba. &quot;Let me tell you something,&quot; hesaid in a speech last week. &quot;I'm not going to change it onesingle bit.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
