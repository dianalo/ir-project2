How do youapply hypcrtext links to database applications without making the uscr learnthe database query language? Our mention of their work in these areas ismeant to open these important issues for discussion, even though IRIS'sdevelopments may not become commercial products.andM;By definition, hypermedia as a concept implies electronic presentation ratherthan paper, because it is through electronic devices that the different media(text, graphics, video, sound, etc.) are presented.andP;  Thus, our look at IRISIntermedia will not reveal a new way of managing typeset documents-althoughits tools might well be used to repackage printed works in electronic form.andO;Instead, this review is a snapshot of a product that shows the potentialbenefits and pitfalls of using the hypertext concept in a networked settingfor working with electronic documents.andP;  A hypermedia document systcm likeIntermedia is both an author's tool and a reader's medium, and its users havefound that using hypertext changes the role of author and reader, opening newpossibilities and presenting new challenges.andM;The project's history.andP;  IRIS was founded in 1983 by Brown University underthe direction of Dr. William S.andP;  Shipp for the purpose of developing computertools for scholarly research.andP;  The founder of Brown's computer scicncedepartment, Andries van Dam, had already spent more than a decade working onhypertext, including a collaboration with Ted Nelson in the late 1960s in thedevelopment of a hypertext system for the IBM 360.andP;  Many of the people whostarted IRIS had worked with van Dam on this and similar projects in the1970s and 1980s.andM;Work on other hypertext systems continued in the years that followed, but in1983 the advent of the Viewpoint software from Xerox and thc subsequent AppleLisa convinced the IRIS researchers that a graphical user interface wouldeventually be the way people interacted with computers.andP;  Thus began itsefforts to discover what would happen if you married a hypertext system witha graphical user interface.andM;An initial design was developed and prototyped by 1985 on a 128K Mac.andP;  Withhelp from IBM, which provided major funding for IRIS from its inception, theinitial multiuser system was built for the RT PC running under Unix.andP;  With agrant from the Annenberg/Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) Project,the prototype was used to develop electronic materials for introductoryEnglish literature and cell biology courses.andM;Today, with the product running under A/UX, Mac IIs are being installed inseveral &quot;electronic classrooms,&quot; which serve as Intermedia computer labs forcourses using Intermedia materials.andP;  From thc start, thc classcs-withfeedback from instructors and students-scrved as the major beta site ofIRIS's development efforts.andP;  Because of the academic environment, wholepapers were published on the successes and shortcomings of thc system, andthe thorough analytical and practical feedback proved invaluable as theproduct evolved.andP;  The rapport that has developed between IRIS and its usersat Brown continues to play a vital role in the Institute's research anddevelopment, as the classes experiment with additional modules.andM;The current product.andP;  It took four years, but by April of this year, IRIS hadhoned its software to the point where it was able to package IntermediaVersion 3.0 software and offcr it as a standard product.andP;  Several modules areavailable, all of which require a Mac 11 with at least 4 MB (preferably 8 MB)of RAM and A/UX (Apple's Unix) .andP;  Intermedia, consisting of a database serverand client application, is distributed by Apple's Programmers' andDevelopers' Association, which -also provides support for A/UX.andP;  It may runas a standalone or network application, and it requires at least 40 MB offree space on the server's Unix disk.andP;  The price for Intermedia is $150 perworkstation, which includes the application modules.andP;  (In a networkconfiguration, only the client application, which takes up less than 2 MB ofRAM, is loaded on each client machine, so local storage need not be more thanthe standard 80-MB A/UX disk.)andM;IRIS distributes two ancillary products, InterLex and Exploring the Moon.andO;InterLex, which is an online version to Houghton Mifflin's American HeritageDictionary, occupies 3 5 MB of space, so an 80-MB disk is the minimum forsetting up a system with the dictionary.andP;  InterLex costs $250 for a networklicense.andP;  Exploring the Moon, which is a self-contained corpus (group) ofIntermedia documents about the Apollo space missions, is $25 and is suppliedon two 800K diskettes.andP;  Although Apple distributes the IRIS Intermediaclient/server software (primarily to aid in support of A/UX), IRIS isresponsible for marketing all Intermedia products at this time.andM;Even though IRIS remains a nonprofit research group, being able to offerIntermedia as a conunercial product has brought the Institute to a landing onits climb up the stairs toward its goal of a true hypermedia product.andP;  It iscontinuing to develop other modules for Intermedia, but it has no desire toget into the business of selling application software, as is evident in itspricing.andP;  Having developed this working product version, it contiunes itsresearch focus on problems not yetandM;addressed in Intermedia: developing the human rhetoric-and computer protocolsand specification standards-for using hypertext technology, in compounddocument editors and across applications in a heterogeneous computingenvironment.andM;Theoretical basis of IntermediaandM;From its inception, IRIS has been concerned with developing tools forcreating, modifiying and reading clectronic documents in a multiuserenvironment.andP;  A capsule of its philosophy and objectives, written by van Damand IRIS co-founders Norman Meyrowitz and Nicole Yankelovich, was publishedin thc October 1985 issue of IEEE's Computer Journal*.andP;  A key premise wasthat &quot;Ideally, authors and readers should have the same set of integratedtools that allow them to browse through other material during the documentpreparation process and to add annotations and original links as theyprogress through an information web.andP;  In effect, the boundary between authorand reader should largely disappear.&quot; The elimination of this boundary is oneof thc key advantages of working with electronic documents instead ofconvention-al books and printed material.andM;But a corollary to the above premise is the notion of how the authors' toolsare integrated together.andP;  As the authors described it, at one end of theintegration continuum, the &quot;electronic document' can comprise many linkeddocuments, each of which is a single medium (text, music, spreadsheet).andP;  Thisis the model of Apple's HyperCard.andP;  Farther along the continuum is the 'cut,copy, paste' paradigm, which is used in Intermedia.andP;  Here, it is possible tocopy bits of heterogeneous applications into each other (e.g., copy a graphicinto a text document), but the semantics of the original source document arelost.andP;  (The graphic becomes a static picture; changes to the source are notreflected in the copy.)andM;The next step up the continuum is what is now referred to as a compounddocument editor that includes objects by reference.andP;  In such a model, allinstances of the graphic would be updated when the source file is updated (asin integrated office applications like Framework, Symphony, etc.).andP;  This isexemplified in Owl Software's Guide, without the use of a compound documentcditor.andM;To take the continuum one step further, the highest level of integrationwould add a context-sensitive cursor, which would enable thc author to modifyall types of media within a single document using the tools of the sourceapplication.andP;  An example of this model-without the hypertcxt links-isDigital's Live Link facility in its Compound Document Architecture, which isused in its DECwrite, DECdecision and DECchart programs.andP;  In Digital's model,clicking on thc object actually launches the source application program.andM;As the authors point out, it is nearly impossible to retrofit existingapplications in such an integrated environment.andP;  To achieve the bestintegration, they saw three methods:andM;* Monolithic applications that understand every type of dataandM;structure that one might want to use.andP;  In practice, software developers havesettled for incorporating as many data formats as is practical, which meansthat they will omit something you might want.andM;* A universal data structure that could be used as a nativeandM;format for ncw applications or that othcr applications could make use ofthrough converters.andP;  This is the approach of DEC's CDA.andP;  The primarylimitations of this approach are the inherent limitations of converters andthe dearth of applications for any new data format.andM;* Attaching functionality to entities in the document, rathcrandM;than to the application.andP;  This approach, based on objectoriented programming,treats each element of the documcnt as an object that contains informationabout all possible operations that can be performed on it.andM;It is this latter approach that IRIS took with Intermedia.andP;  However, it isimportant to point out that IRIS Intermedia does not currently providesupport for true compound documents.andM;Design decisions.andP;  IR-IS had several objectives that it hasandM;met with Intermcdia.andP;  Among the most important are the blending of anexisting graphical user interface with objectbased building blocks thattogether remove the burden of userinterface consistency from the applicationdeveloper yet provide the means to implement hypermedia consistently amongdifferent applications, Thc use of object-oriented programming also allowedconcurrent development of application modules, integrates separate moduleswithout recompilation, and makes the system extensible.andP;  Intermediaconclusively demonstrates that applications written in object-orientedprogramming need not be slow.andM;A key concept in Intermedia's underlying design is the separation of thehypertext links from the documents that actually contain the links.andP;  In thisrespect, Intermedia differs from most hypertext products, including HyperCardand Scribe Systems' Knowledge Management System (KMS), which embed the linksdirectly into the cards or frames created within those programs.andM;This separation was set up because IRIS wanted 1) to allow multiple users tomake finks simultaneously to the same document (without having to solve theproblems associated with more than one user writing out a documcnt); 2) toallow users to superimpose different sets of links on documents (two studentscould use thc same collection of source material but create links to supportdiffcrent arguments, for example); and 3) to allow users to link to read-onlyfile systems (such as CD-ROM, which it hopes to support in the future.)andM;Intermedia's architecture is one of several layers.andP;  At the kernel is Unix,which was selected as thc operating system because of its multitasking,multiuser capabilities.andP;  On top of that, all application software is writtenin an object-oriented programming language (similar to C + + ), whichprovides the structure and methodology of the development environment.andP;  Forexample, therc is a layer for MacApp, the toolkit for budding Macintoshapplications, which provides a set of base classes from which to buildapplications that will share a common user interface.andP;  IRIS wanted to avoiddeveloping its own user interface, and at the time there werc no graphicaluser interfaces available for Unix.andP;  Ironically, using CadMac,a Unix-basedtoolkit from Cadmus for developing MacApp applications, IRIS was ablc toimplement a Mac interface on an IBM RT.andP;  When Apple introduced A/UX for theMac II in 1988, and began to back IRIS with its own finding, IRIS portedIntermedia from the RT to the Mac II.andP;  According to Paul Kahn, the project'scoordinator, the port took only one week.andM;On top of (or underneath if you look at the hierarchy as starting from thetop) the MacApp layer is a layer of Intermedia building blocks: onc each fortext, graphics and tables.andP;  The Intermedia layer also augments the MacAppclasses to include the concept of linking documents and running multipleapplications on thc desktop.andP;  Above the Intermedia building blocks are theapplication layers.andP;  By using thc objcct-oriented environment, thc IRISapplication developers did not need to reimplement the functionality oflinking and of other actions that are available throughout the systcm.andP;  Thisapproach frees the developer to focus on the specifics of the application athand.andP;  And end users are guaranteed that similar actions work in a consistentfashion regardless of what applications they are using.andM;Mac user interface.andP;  The use of MacApp provides Intermedia with a userinterface that is like that of any Mac application, which means the programis easily learned.andP;  Pull-down menus and their keyboard shortcuts follow Macconventions.andP;  Windows operate much the same as any Mac application; the onlydifference is that double-clicking in the file-name bar automatically sizesthe window to that part of the screen.andP;  As with recent Mac programs, graphicspalettes, control panels and the style list of the word processor may beopened in the document window and stay with the document while you work.andM;Many developers have rightfully complained that Apple's implementation ofUnix does not support multiplc applications written within MacApp.andP;  (Thus, toget the Mac user interface, you lose onc of the key benefits of Unix.) InIntermedia this limitation is not apparent, because, although it is fourdifferent application modules, all run as if they wcre one application toUnix.andP;  In this way it is possible in Intermedia to open at one time anynumber of documents created with the different modules.andP;  You can freelyswitch windows and application modules without any delay.andM;The Intermedia environmentandM;Intermcdia has two main components: a server, which is the database manager,and client software, which is four application modules-word processor,drawing program, raster image viewer and timeline editor.andP;  A dictionaryfacility is available across all of these modules.andP;  Research is beingconducted on video and animation application.andM;Each of the application modules shares the use of the hypertext server.andP;  Wewill first describe the interface and database aspects of the server and theneach of the application modules in tum.andP;  We will also describe the video andanimation research because of its implications for the publishing industry.andM;The Intermedia server software.andP;  The server is based on a relational database(in this case, CTree) in which the links are objects that have associatedproperties.andP;  The properties include the source and destination blocks andtheir documents, thc name and kcy word descriptions of the links, theirauthors and the dates they were created.andP;  Typicafly, thc link's propertysheet is filled out as the user creates a link (see photo, below).andM;Intermedia presents the user with a desktop that is similar to a Mac desktop:files are grouped in hierarchical folders that mirror the underlying Unixdirectories.andP;  Webs (collections of links) and documents are shown as icons,and the appropriate applications are automatically launched when icons areopened through thc put-down menu or the double-click short cut.andM;Creating links.andP;  Every hypertext product has some sort of mechanism forcreating, manipulating and displaying its links Intermedia is no exception.andM;The process of creating a link within an Intermedia document is much likecutting and pasting objects using the Macintosh clipboard.andP;  To create a link,you define a block, or anchor point for the start of a link, which may be assmall as a single character or as large as an entire document.andP;  From thedefined anchor, you then open the window of the document to which you want tolink, highlight the area you want to be that block, and complete the link,which is a bidirectional path between two blocks.andP;  The ability to create alink from any selection, rather than from an entire document or frame, is adistinguishing characteristic of Intermedia, and one that makes it botheasier to use and more flexible than other hypertext systems.andM;A link is always shown on the screen as a link icon, a small box with anarrow inside.andP;  Double-clicking on this icon takes the user to the point thatlies at the other end of the link.andP;  More than one link may emanate from asingle anchor.andP;  When you activate the link from such an anchor, a dialog boxlets you select the link you want to pursue.andP;  Webs.andP;  The advantage of thedatabase approach to hypertext is apparent when working with webs, IRIS'sterm for a series of finks that have been grouped together under a singlename.andM;In Intermedia, IRIS has used the web concept to provide temporal and spatialvisual aids that help the user navigate through a complex set of documents.andO;The system ensures that all links are connected to a web, because to createor follow links, you must first create a web, or open an existing web.andP;  Then,when you add a link, it Is automatically added to the web (and updated on theweb view on the screen).andP;  Webs may encompass many documents created indifferent modules of Intermedia by as many users as have access to thefolder.andP;  In addition, webs may be shared by multiple users.andP;  The sharing ofwebs is particularly handy in a multi-user setting, where different users areall creating their own links.andP;  Through the use of the web, you can see andmake usc of links that someone else has created.andP;  Because the links are notpart of the actual document, different webs may make use of common documents.andM;The Path View of the web shows an audit trail of aU the documents throughwhich a user has traveled to reach the current location (see photo, nextpage).andP;  Mini- icons are used to represent thc different types of documents,and three types of markers indicate whether the documcnt was reached byfollowing a link, by opening it from the desktop, or by reactivating an openwindow.andP;  When the user is following a series of links, the path view answersthe frequent question &quot;How did I get here?&quot; in a manner that is unobtrusiveon the screen.andP;  The path may also be used to navigate: any document may beopened by doublc-clicking on the mini-icon in the path, In this way, a usercan easily retrace his steps to the point of departure.andM;There are at least two thorny problems to real-time updating of an audittrail.andP;  The first is what happens if a uscr changes the name of the file?andO;Intermedia will automatically go back and update all previous occurrences ofthat file in that user's path to show the current name.andP;  Other users' pathsare updated to reflect thc new file name only after the web is closed andreopened.andP;  This is also true for the name of thc file in another user'sfolder view.andP;  While this feature keeps your path current at all times.andP;  Itmay be disconcerting to another user looking for the file under a previousname.andM;A second problem is that Unix permits files in different directories to haveidentical names.andP;  IR-IS compounded this problem when it supported the Macfile conventions (resource and data forks) under Unix.andP;  The resource forkstores the Intermedia file name (e.g., My Documcnt); the systcm assigns aunique number (e.g., 0000000001356) as the Unix file name.andP;  This does allowfile names to have up to 32 characters, including spaces.andP;  (Unix allows filenames of up to 14 characters, with no spaces.) But it also allows multiplefiles of the same name to exist within thc same folder! (To Unix, each filehas a unique number.) Obviously, this limitation can prove troublesome.andP;  Onehelp, though, is that in the Map view (described below), the description ofthe link givcs the user additional information about the document that mightdifferentiate it from a similarly named document,andM;The Map component of die web is a spatial representation of all of the linksassociated with the currently activated document (see photo) .andP;  It answersthe question 'Where can I go from hcre?&quot; and in thc same manner as the pathlets the user go to any linked documcnt by double-clicking on its mini-icon.andM;The map view may be contrasted with a frame-based hypertext system likeHyperCard or KMS in which you see links within a single frame, but you cannotsee where the links go, and you cannot see all of the links from thc set offrames, or &quot;card stack,&quot; without going through cach and ever), frame.andP;  Withthc map, you see aB of the links emanating from the document you have open atthat time, regardless of where the link is in relation to the spot you haveshowing on the screen.andP;  If one of those links looks interesting, you canactivate it right from thc web, rather than scrolling through the documentlooking for it.andM;Another advantage of thc map is that it may be uscd to preview a link.andP;  Whenyou select a block anchor in a document, thc map turns the links from thatblock to bold, showing thc user where the link goes without having to gothere.andP;  You can simply continue in die document or you can follow the linkfrom the map without even having to open the linked document from thedcsktop.andM;One feature that IRIS intended to provide but that proved unwieldy was aglobal view of all links in a web.andP;  The global view, which is present in someearlier hypertext systcms, was meant to show a complete spatial overview ofthc web.andP;  IRIS found that in a multiuser setting, with hundreds and eventhousands of links within a single web, displaying such an enormous ma wasimpractical on a computer screen.andP;  In many cases, it wasn't even practical toshow all of die links associated with just the documcnts displayed in adirectory.andP;  Even when aU of thc links could be shown, the global view mightnot provide sufficient detail to be useful.andP;  (As Kahn described it, theglobal view begins to look like spaghetti.) For example, how do you showwhich links arc morc important than others? How do you organize the topologyof a global view?andM;In the end, IRIS concluded that in its system webs have no inherent topology.andO;Given the difficulties of displaying large webs in their entirety, ittherefore limited the web view to only those links available from within theopen document.andP;  However, recognizing the need to provide the user with anoverall feel for the size of thc web, IRIS added the scope line to the webview.andP;  The scope line, a single line at the top of the web window, shows howmany documents and links are in the web.andM;Thc lack of a global view points out one of the inherent limitations ofhypertext/hypermedia technology.andP;  Unless a mechanism is provided for viewingthe overall network structure, the end user begins to view information at amolecular level, unable to see the overall framework for seeing too manyatoms.andP;  The use of a hierarchical view-such as the folder display ofdirectories on the desktop in Intermedia-is one alternative way of viewingthe database structure.andP;  The hierarchical view is also useful when trying tolocates specific information that may not be immediately accessible throughlinks from the present location.andP;  But, while the browsing metaphor ofhypertcxt is exciting as an alternative way of interacting with information,it is likely that we wiU need to develop a means of visually displaying aview of the overall network that is efficient yet readily understood.andM;Because of its database approach, it is theoretically possible (though notyet implemented in Intermedia) for the user to search or sort links.andP;  Forexample, a user might want to display all links associated with Henry Blakein a web of English literature.andP;  Using Boolean search techniques, this listcould be further refined, using any ofthe link's properties, until the userhad a list of documcnts she wanted to pursue.andP;  All of this could be donewithout opening any of the documents, which would make the process fast, evenin a networked setting.andP;  Although this feature is not yet implemented, itspossibility suggests the strength of the database approach to hypertext thatIntermedia employs.andP;  As we'd see in a moment, it also points to howIntermedia might be used with other database programs.andM;It is also worth noting that the web is exceptionally fastupdates arevirtually instantaneous, even when working on a network-because the hypertextlinks are kept in a database separate from the documents.andP;  Rather than havingto scroll through an entire document to find every link and then display iton thc screen, the system looks to the database to find all links associatedwith that document.andP;  We found the combination of temporal and spatial viewsprovided automatically by the computer, along with mechanisms for using thoseviews to navigate through documents, to be very effective, easily learned andmastered, yet unobtrusive on the screen.andM;Creating Intermedia documentsandM;With the exception of webs, all components of Intermedia electronic documentsare created using the &quot;client&quot; application modules.andP;  The suite issufficiently robust to provide an integrated environment for authors tocreate a variety of electronic documents.andM;InterWord.andP;  In features, the Intermedia word processor is much like earlyversions of MacWrite, except that it makes use of styles, similar to those ofMicrosoft Word, rather than the MacWrite ruler.andP;  InterWord saves the font,size and attribute settings of selected text as a named style, which may thenbe applied to other portions of text.andP;  AH instances of a style in a documentare updated when the style's name is selected during a change to onc of itsinstances.andM;InterWord uses the now-common Macintosh ruler for setting tabs, margins andjustification.andM;InterWord imports documents in Word's RTF format and translates any Wordstyles into InterWord styles.andP;  InterWord also exports documents in RTFformat, but the links are lost.andM;Another similarity to Word is InterWord's ability to place drawings or imagesin a text document.andP;  Graphics are placed as if they were a single character.andO;They are shown on the screen as they will appear in print, but, once movedinto Interword, they cannot be edited within the InterWord document.andM;Links in InterWord may emanate from any selection, from as small as aninsertion point to as large as thc entire document.andP;  When you follow a linkto mother InterWord document, the opened document is automatically scrolledto the connecting link anchor, and the link is highlighted with a dottedrectangle marquec.andM;Editing tcxt within a link anchor does not affect the link, unless you deletethe anchor itself, which deletes the link (but not the anchor at the otherend).andM;Aside from its incorporation of graphics and styles, InterWord is not anexceptional word processor.andP;  IRIS did not intend to make a product that wascommercially competitive.andP;  InterWord is meant to be merely a functional toolfor demonstrating the capabilities of Intermedia, and it fills that roleadequately.andP;  IRIS is exploring the concept of a compound document editor forIntermedia, but this project is still in embryonic form.andM;InterDraw.andP;  The Intermedia drawing module is much like an carly MacDraw,proving a basic set of structured drawing and text tools.andM;It imports documents from MacDraw in PIC-F format.andP;  Theoretically, it willimport images from other programs that save documents in PICT format, but inreality some programs vary the PlCT format sufficiently that their PICT filesfall Intermedia's PICT translator.andM;In InterDraw, links may be attached to anything that can be selected, whetherit be an object or a set of objects.andP;  The latter option is useful for linkingto several objects that might not be convenient to handle as a group withinthe drawing program.andP;  When you follow a fink to an InterDraw document, it,too,is scrolled (if necessary) to the link, but the link itself is indicatedby highlighting the linked objccts in gray, rather than by a marquee.andM;InterVal timeline editor.andP;  One module that is rather different isIntermedia's timeline editor, InterVal.andP;  This module automatically sortsevents chronologically by year and displays them on a vertical timeline.andO;Month notations must be sorted manually by cutting and pasting objects intothe proper order, and the timeline does not show time intervalsproportionally, but any event on the timeline may be a block with associatedlinks.andP;  Links are handied in much the same fashion as InterWord.andM;InterVal has the same basic text editing features as InterDraw, which doesnot support styles or mixed fonts within a single object.andM;InterVal is a nice complement to the other modules because a typical use ofIntermedia is creating overviews that show a historical perspectivc of aparticular subject.andP;  For example, the English department is using Intcrmediato link materials by and about authors of diffcrent periods.andP;  An overview ofDickens shows links to his works, critical analyses, biographies, images ofDickens and other people and things from thc Victorian era, and a timeline ofDickens's life.andP;  The timeline shows the student the order in which all ofDickens's novels were written in the context of other events of the era-allin one compact form that may be found simply by following a link from one ofthe othcr documents.andM;The example of using InterVal in studying literature illustrates howIntermedia encourages users to make connections among events, people andthings in ways that might not be part of the standard document set.andP;  Therelationship between historical events and authors' works, for example, isoften explored in critical analyses of individual works, but rarely does thestudent have a chance to compare a timeline of events to works by severalauthors at the same time.andP;  This same princiPIC-using a timeline to connectotherwise disassociated events-could be useful in a wide variety ofdisciplines, both inside and outside the educational setting.andM;InterPix.andP;  The raster image viewer is used to import images in MacPaintformat, crop them and copy them into a document created in InterWord,InterDraw or InterVal.andM;InterLex.andP;  InterLex is an Intermedia application that works with all of theabove modules.andP;  It is-to use die Macintosh metaphor-a dictionary deskaccessory.andP;  To our knowledge, it is die first online implementation ofHoughton Mifflin's American Heritage Dictatonary to make use of the codingstructure Houghton Mifflin now supplies.andP;  It is also one of the few multiuserimplementations of the dictionary.andM;As you would expect, the dictionary lets you look up the spelling of words.andO;But it also contains thc full meanings, derivations and phoneticpronunciations.andP;  You can copy definitions into other documents and creatclinks to them.andP;  If for example, you were creating a glossary as part of aproject, you could have links associated with special terms so the readercould go directly to the definition and then return to the point ofdeparture.andM;Unfortunately, Houghton Mifflin does not supply electronic versions of theillustrations that appear in the printed form of this dictionary.andP;  (Thereason is that few of the AHD illustrations are actually copyrighted byHoughton Mifflin.) However, InterLex does provide two features that theprinted version lacks: an immediate go-to and concept-oriented searches.andM;The go-to function provides a command by which you select any word in anyIntermedia document (tcxt, graphics or timeline), and the system willautomatically go and look up its definition, faster than you could fund ityourself Implemented as a desk acccssory in Intermedia, InterLex providesthis feature for any Intermcdia application that doesn't use thc Command-Lsequence as a short cut.andM;The second bonus, concept-oriented searches, is possiblc because IRIS hasindexed the dictionary by components, using the coded information HoughtonMifflin supplied.andP;  Essentially, IRIS indexed every word in the dictionary(including aB words in thc pronunciations, derivations and definitions)according to how the word was uscd, with a pointer from its place in theindex to its place in thc dictionary.andM;The user may broaden a search to include inflections and derivations(eg.,&quot;do&quot; expanded to include &quot;doing&quot; or &quot;redo&quot;) and refine the search byselecting which parts of an entry to include in the search: subjects, phrasalverbs, idioms, definitions, supplementary information, etymologies andpronunciation.andP;  Through the use of thc InterLex control panel (see photo,previous page), the user is thus able to find occurrcnces of a word withinanothcr word's definition, which may lead the user on a new trail of wordexploration.andP;  Using the indexing table, the system finds these occurrencesand then builds the list of &quot;hits&quot; without having to search the actualdictionary.andP;  It is only when you pursue one of the hits that the program goesto the dictionary itselfandM;If you are interested in the concept of art, for example, by searching onthat term InterLex finds 32 main entries, including martial art, pop art andstate of the art.andP;  Any of these may be pursued to its definition, andmultiple definitions may be viewed at one time.andP;  Further refinement of thesearch might lead to derivations (artistic, artist), art forms (ballet[artistic dance] or painting) that have forms of the root art in theirdefinitions and people who were artists (Leonardo da Vinci).andP;  Quite a few ofthese words would not be found browsing a conventional dictionary in the &quot;A&quot;section.andM;You can use the control panel to search for any part of a word's definition.andO;In pronunciation, for example, you can search words that contain particularsounds (useful for finding rhymes).andP;  Typing Yiddish in thc etymology fieldleads to a search of all words with Yiddish derivations.andP;  Typing French inthe etymology field leads to a message of how many words are found to be ofFrench origin, but no list.andP;  To maintain the speed of the system (and it isfast), IRIS limited full indexing to items that appear fewer than 500 times.andM;Wildcards are supported, but because the dictionary *Is large, their useshould be narrowed as much as possible.andP;  (Putting wildcards both before andafter a sequence of letters, for example, would initiate a search of theentire dictionary rather than the indexing table.)andM;Despite its limitations, InterLex is far more powerful than any presentdictionary-printed or electronic-with the possiblc exception of thc newOxford English Dictionary project at the University of Waterloo (Ontario).andO;The ability to find words by association opens up all sorts of unexpectedconnections that are virtually impossible to make in a standard dictionary.andM;In addition to providing concept searches, thc use of Houghton Mifflin'scoding enabled IRIS to offer two display formats, traditional dictionarystyle and an outline view that is especially useful for words with multiplemeanings (see sidebar) .andM;IRIS is working on extending InterLex to include a spelling checker and athesaurus, both based on software supplied by Houghton Mifflin.andP;  It will alsomake use of Houghton Mifflin's compact version of the dictionary (5 MBinstead of 35) when it becomes available later this year.andP;  InterVideo.andO;Unlike the previous modules, which arc part of the released version of IRISIntermedia, InterVideo and InterPlay are examples of current research.andO;InterVideo integrates a vidcodisc player into the Intermedia environment.andP;  Italso is the first nongraphical medium that IRIS has implemented, a facet thatposes special challenges.andM;The table-building block mentioned above in the discussion of Intermedia'stheoretical basis was added for applications like InterVideo.andP;  Ideally, userswould like live video to be part of their desktop repertoire, but to do sorequires a video intcrface that handles 30 frames per second.andP;  Not havingsuch a technology available on the Mac II, IRIS chose to begin with aninterface to a standard videodisc player via thc InterVideo software.andP;  Thedisplay and audio of the disc occur on a television monitor; the softwareacts as the remote control for operating the player.andM;The incorporation of a medium outside the computer's domainted IRIS to extendits hypertext framework to include the notion of a proxy.andP;  The proxy is thevicw of thc medium that thc Intermedia user secs and interacts with; it isnot the medium itselfandM;In this case, the videodisc is a play-only medium; like audio compact discs,laser videodiscs are madc in quantities from masters, which cost about $1,000to $1,200 to havc made.andP;  Each laser videodisc contains about 54,000 frames oflive video or still frames.andM;InterVideo lets the user select the frame or sequence of framcs thatconstitute a proxy.andP;  Each frame on the disc has a separate ID number, whichcan be read by InterVideo from the videodisc player.andP;  The user simply playsthe video, stops at the frame that is to begin the sequence, marks that asthe starting point, goes to the desired end of the sequence and marks that asthe end point.andP;  The user thcn gives the sequence (or one still frame) a nameand an identifier, which are uscd as the Im name and identifier the same asin the other modules.andP;  A table of linked sequences and still frames is builtfor the videodisc (see photo on page 2 9) .andP;  At any time, the user may editthe proxy view, that is, the table, much as a video editor edits a videotape.andO;The tape may be played at different speeds, stopped, moved ahead in fastforward, rewound or played at its normal speed.andP;  The videodisc is neveraltered, but the user controls what parts of the disc are played, dependingon die link activated.andM;To accommodate the notion of a medium that is not static, IRIS added a Runstatus to a fink.andP;  The run link, when followed, plays the predefined sequencethat is at the other end of the link without die user having to intervene.andO;This is analogous to scrolling the document to the link marker, except thatin this case the video is also played.andM;When an InterVideo document is in the current window, the user sees in theweb view a map of all documents linked to this video document.andP;  Any number ofInterVideo documents may refer to the same side of the same videodisc.andP;  Whatthe user sees depends on what proxy document is selected.andM;InterPlay.andP;  Another research application module that is not yet complete,InterPlay is a module for animating still frames created as Intermediadocuments.andP;  Its tools are identical to those of InterDraw, with the additionof the concept of &quot;frames&quot; and a control panel, like InterVideo, with whichyou set up, play and edit your stills.andP;  Links may be associated with a partof a stifl, an entire frame or a sequence.andP;  Currently, the software onlysupports a run link that plays whatever stiffs are in the sequence.andP;  Morefunctionality may be included in die released product.andM;Looking ahead to other media.andP;  The two new concepts in InterVideo-the proxyview and the run link-are important because they show how hypertext might beimplemented with other nongraphical media, such as music, and how it mightinterface to othcr databases.andP;  In a database application, for example, theproxy view could be the interface with which the user constructs the query.andO;The system takes care of translating that query into the query language ofthe database program, whether it be SQL or the native language of dBase.andP;  Theuser has to learn only one interface that could be implemented for any numberof query languages.andP;  Furthermore, the run link could be used as a kind ofscript to automatically execute a predefined query and search.andP;  Any time theuser activated the link, he would receive the results of the search based onthe current information in the database.andM;One difficulty of working with nongraphical media, however, is how toindicate a link to the user who is just running through a sequence from startto finish.andP;  In audio, for example, do you make the link portion (a clarinetsolo) louder? Do you play only the solo, without the surrounding instruments?andO;Do you play only the portion of the piece that has the solo to emphasize whatit was you thought was significant?andM;These are just some of the questions that arise bccause there is not yet acommon rhetoric of hypertext.andP;  In books, we know what is meant by table ofcontents, index, cross- reference or footnote.andP;  But in hypertext, what is aIU? What are the different kinds of links, and how are they different fromone anothcr? Gradually, as hypertext becomes more widespread, a rhetoric ofhypertext interaction will develop, just as over thousands of years we havebecome familiar with established conventions for printed books.andM;How Intermedia relates to publishingandM;If you accept the notion that publishing has become morc than just puttingmarks on paper, Intermedia is not only a publishing product, it is adevelopment environment that points toward the future of electronicpublishing in general.andP;  Unlike KMS, which could be put to good use in helpingto produce documents on paper, Intermedia was designed for electronicdocuments.andP;  It opens up a new way of interacting with electronicallypublished information that goes far beyond linking documents that will bc puton paper.andP;  And unlike HyperCard, which is a sclf-contained application,Intcrmedia was designed to work with multiple applications shared by multipleusers.andM;We see Intermedia's immediate relevance to the publishing market in fourprimary areas.andP;  The university market is likely to be the one in which it ismost used, simply because the product was specifically designed for scholarlyresearch.andP;  But interest in the product from other markets has grown sinceintermedia was introduced a few months ago.andM;Intermedia as an educational tool.andP;  Intermedia is a fullfledged developmentenvironment for creating databases of electronic documents.andP;  Brown's Englishand biology departments and thc Johns Hopkins medical school have alreadybegun using thc system to create electronic course materials that offcrstudents a new way of exploring their fields.andP;  George Landow, the Englishprofessor at Brown who set up an Intermedia web for his survey of Englishliterature class, found that students who used Intcrmedia grasped thematerial much better than those who did not usc it, and that the classcomments of Intermedia students shifted from questions like &quot;I wonder ifanyone could tell me why .andP;  .  .&quot; to factual statements and criticaljudgments, as students werc able to explore some of the connectionsthemselves.andM;Interestingly, Landow found unexpected benefits of using Intermedia that wentagainst the grain of many computeraided instruction (CAI) tools.andP;  Unlike manyCAI programs in which the student moves in a linear fashion through a set ofexercises, Intermedia is a dynamic tool in which thc student makes choicesand decisions about what to explore.andP;  Because students begin to see theimportance of connections, Landow found that his Inten-nedia students beganto see thc importance of such apparati in books-summaries, glossaries,footnotes and so forth-whereas before many inexperienced or unskilledfreshman failed to make use of such materials.andP;  In fact, after seeing howinterrelated so many things wcre, his Intermedia students actually beganreading all of their assigmnents, for fear of missing a connection! Thus,Inten-nedia taught and reinforced reading skills, defying conventional wisdomthat computer-aided instruction drives students away from books.andM;Commercial and scholarly publishing.andP;  Publishers of college and referencetextbooks would be one potential commercial market.andP;  just as Exploring theMoon (see sidebar), was developed for use in a graduate geology curriculum socould othcr products be developed for this and other fields.andP;  For example, apublisher of geography texts could supplement the text with anIntermedia-based disk that would have maps of varying levels of detail, withlinks to reference documents, historical timelines for each continent orcountry and so forth.andP;  Paul Kahn of IRIS developed a rather extensiveIntermedia wcb based on Chinese literature and the translations of die poetryof Tu Fu by Kenneth Rexroth that shows how previously published works couldbe repackaged and published in an electronic form that would offer greatpotential for new insights for students.andP;  To do a similar project, thepublisher would have to assemble the set of documents and create the links;it would not have to develop software, because thc interaction and deliverymechanism is provided by Intermcdia.andM;Unfortunately, most college-text publishers do not write their booksthemselves.andP;  Creating an Intermcdia ancillary would require a commitment bythe author(s) to develop the software, with a commitment by the publishcr tofind, market and distribute thc product.andM;Nevertheless, we believe that textbook publishers should look at Intermediaas a way to prepare themselves for thc future.andP;  Today, textbooks are theprimary component of a package the publisher sells to the educationalinstitution.andP;  However, the proportion of nonpaper ancillaries-slidcs, videos,tape recordings and software-is likely to change in the coming decade .andP;  WynCarus, who heads Houghton Mifflin's Business Software Group, says that onereason Houghton Mifflin is investigating IRIS is because there is no styleguide for hypertext, no counterpart to, say, The Chicago Manual of Style orWords into Type.andP;  &quot;Providing a consistent style, organizing and refiningcontent and preparing documents for presentation are things that publishersare skilled at,&quot; Carus contends.andM;As electronic media bccome important in a publisher's product mix, it will becritical to have experience working with new media and their tools.andO;Intermedia provides an opportunity to explore new media before their use ismandatory from a marketing standpoint.andM;Business applications.andP;  Intermedia as a product is not likely to be adoptedoutside the university or conunercial publishing world, but several companiesare already innvestigating the product as part of their efforts to developalternative distribution and retrieval systems for coporate information.andM;The technical resource subsidiary at Southwestern Ben is one such company.andO;Rudy Reyna, the director of advanced technologies for Southwestern Bell, isexploring every hypertext/hypermedia product he can find as part of hiseffort to prototype an clectronic system for delivering and interacting withthe voluminous operations and training manuals that are used throughout thecorporation's subsidiaries.andP;  &quot;Until now, most electronic publishing systemshave taken a linear approach to presenting information,&quot; Reyna says.andO;&quot;Hypertext is a foundation for an alternative way of interacting withinformation that is more akin to the way we think.&quot;andM;He sees the multiuser support of Intermedia as one of its strengths.andP;  &quot;Rightnow, we're looking at integrating a series of standalone systems based onoff-the-shelf products.andP;  But die real long-term objective is to incorporatehypertext into large databases.&quot; For him ,Intermedia is just the first steptoward exploring the potential benefits and problems of implementinghypertext on a much larger scale than single workstations.andM;The real future- system applicationsandM;One of the distinct drawbacks of Intermedia is that because it runs underA/LJX instead of the Mac OS, it is impossiblc to interact with other programswhile running Intermedia.andP;  In this sense, thc program shows how powerful ahypertext facility embedded at a lower level, that is underneath theapplication, would be.andP;  No computer company has a compound documentarchitecture that supports hypertext, so IRIS had little choice but todevelop its own programming environment, one that restricts links toIntermedia modules.andP;  Thus, it is possible to import text, graphics and imagesfrom Mac applications, but only after they are imported can you apply links.andO;Even so, the framework of Intermedia, where hypertext is implementedindependent of the uscr interface and the documents that makc up a database,is a prototype of how a computer company might implement hypertcxt at theoperating system level.andM;Applc isone computer supplier that has taken a keen interest in the project.andO;Katie Povejsil, who as part of Apple's higher education marketing group hasbeen involved with IRIS for some time, described IR-IS as a &quot;living prototypefor answering questions like 'How do people electronically annotate orcollaborate?&quot;' With the success of HyperCard, which is educating the Macaudicnce in a new technology that offers new approaches and solutions toproblems, Apple is committed to moving toward hypertext and hypermedia, saysPovejsil.andP;  She concurs with thc conclusion we drew from our experience withIntermedia: that in the long run, thc potential of hypertext wiU be bestrealized if it is implemented at the operating system level, preferably in atoolkit that developers can make use of in a consistent manner, much as theydo today with the Mac user interface.andP;  Such a toolkit would ensure consistentusc of thc hypertext links and allow documents of completely different typesto share links.andM;Clearly, such an implementation is not something we can expect in the nextyear, most likely not even for several years.andP;  But the IRIS product as itexists today goes a long way toward meeting one of the Institute's originalgoals: showing the viability of the hypertext concept as an ingredient of asystemlevel architecture.andP;  And from a more human perspective, because it goesbeyond a single user's text files into the realm of shared webs ofinformation and nongraphical media, Intermcdia also etches its mark into thesurface of hypertcxt rhetoricthe language, conventions and understanding of away of writing that is still very young.andM;*Exploring the Moon'andM;Exploring the Moon is a collection of Intermedia documents and anaccompanying database about the seven Apollo missions NASA made to the moon.andO;It is the first commercial demonstration of Intermedia and is now availableon diskettes from IRIS.andM;The power of Intermedia is apparent in the overview document, created inInterDraw.andP;  A photo of the moon is labeled with the different mission landingspots, each with a link to a document about that mission.andP;  In addition toarticles about the missions, there are photos of parts of the moon's surfaceand a timeline of the Apollo program.andM;Exploring the Moon is aptly named because it encourages the user to explorerather than read in a linear fashion.andP;  You can begin anywhere and navigatefreely to any point using the web (see photo, below).andP;  Of course, you canalso go through all of the material in a serial fashion the same as if youwere reading an encyclopedia, but in Intermedia you have the additionaloption of browsing in a nonlinear manner.andP;  Learning about the Apollo missionbecomes a much more dynamic experience than simply reading an illustratedtext, because the reader decides which connections to follow by the choice oflinks to pursue.andM;Separating Form and contentandM;With InterLex, its online implementation of the second college edition ofHoughton Mifflin's American Heritage Dictionary, IRIS took a reference work,in this case a dictionary, that had been put into tagged database form, andcreated a powerful retrieval tool by indexing the components that wereidentified using standard coding conventions.andP;  The end result is thatInterLex expands the utility of a dictionary by offering context searches(see main text).andM;InterLex has another unique feature that stems from IRIS's use of the taggedfile from Houghton Mifflin.andP;  Because the form, or appearance, of each elementof the dictionary is identified separately from the object itself, IRISformats the display of the entry on the fly in either of two formats:standard dictionary layout, or outline form (see photo).andP;  In a typical onlinedictionary based on a flat file, only the traditional, printed dictionarystyle would be presented.andP;  Intermedia demonstrates that the outline form isclearly superior for quickly skimming the definitions of words that havemultiple meanings.andM;Unlike SGML editors, which purposefully expose the author to SGML, InterLexhides the codes completely from the user.andP;  The user makes choices from thecontrol panel, and the system makes use of the codes as it brings theappropriate display window to the screen.andP;  However, InterLex shares oneaspect in common with WYSIWYG SGML editors: The form of the content displayis kept separate from the actual content.andP;  Thus, in the future, IRIS couldcreate new display formats without touching the underlying dictionary.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
