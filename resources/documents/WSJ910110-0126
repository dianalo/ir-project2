Al Pena, president of Local 1104, which includes 2,500members of the United Steelworkers of America at the jointventure plant in Lorain, Ohio, sent letters this week to hismembers seeking permission to request a contract extension.If a majority of union members agree, the plant couldcontinue operations even if union members at the remainingUSX plants go on strike.</LP><TEXT>   USX and the union resumed talks this week to negotiate anew contract. The current contract expires Jan. 31.   USS/Kobe, a venture formed with Kobe Steel Ltd. of Japanin 1989 to produce steel bars, has a separate bargainingagreement, which also expires on Jan. 31. Technically, thejoint venture talks are separate, but the union wants similarterms for both the venture and USX.   Undoubtedly, the union wants a united front in case talksbreak down and members choose to strike the nation's largeststeelmaker. The fact that one local is considering workinguntil a new contract is reached indicates frustration amongsome union members and fear of another strike. In 1986, boththe company and the union suffered through a six-monthstrike.   Although neither side wants a strike, both are preparingfor one. USX's USS unit has been building inventory in orderto continue serving customers in the event of a strike andthe union is preparing picket line rosters.   Industry consultants and analysts expect talks to go tothe wire, with an ultimate resolution. They note that USXwould lose good will among its customer base if it failsagain to reach a contract without a strike. Meanwhile, unionmembers, worried about plant shutdowns, don't want anotherprolonged work stoppage.   The union and USX began contract talks last fall and hadhoped to reach an early settlement by Nov. 10. However, talksbroke down and weren't resumed until this week. A key issuein negotiations is protection for union members and retireesin the event that USX, as expected, sells or spins off partor all of its steel operations. In addition, the unioncontinues to seek a contract patterned after accords reachedin 1989 with other major steelmakers, even though USX hasdeemed them too rich.   The union and the company have both agreed to a newsblackout.</TEXT></DOC>
