(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>There is a gloomy sense of historic inevitability hanging over the personalcomputer industry these days.andP;  Just as in the early days of automobiles,airplanes, radios - probably bows and arrows, for that matter - we have beenthrough a period of rapid growth and product proliferation.andP;  Hundreds ofmanufacturers flourished, or at least had an opportunity to try theirvariations on the IBM-compatible theme.andP;  Now comes the inevitable part.andP;  Themarket approaches saturation, growth rates slow, and a few major playersincreasingly dominate the industry.andP;  The second- and third-tier clones becomeanswers to trivia questions.andM;What makes life more interesting than history is that there are always peoplewho refuse to go along with the inevitable.andP;  They look at a maturing marketcommanded by ten or twelve larger competitors and see, instead of mortaldanger, opportunity.andP;  That is the attitude at two companies we think of asintriguing despite their position deep in the second tier of personalcomputer makers - NCR and Everex Systems.andM;We picked two very different companies for this exercise, partly to remindourselves that size alone doesn't determine survival.andP;  Elephants andjackrabbits, after all, do all right in their respective ecological niches.andO;NCR is huge and highly visible; its moves in the desktop business often seemponderous.andP;  Personal computers accounted for only about 7% of its $6 billionin revenues last year.andP;  Everex is far smaller, with sales heading for about$430 million in the fiscal year that ends this month.andP;  It is agile enough tohop immediately onto every product opportunity that comes along-perhaps toomany.andM;Both companies have to be considered long shots to achieve serious inroads onthe leaders in personal computing.andP;  To make Dataquest's Top Ten of worldleaders in Intel-based systems last year, you needed to ship at least 230,000units - the number credited to AST Research.andP;  Market researchers put NCR'spersonal computer shipments somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 last year;Everex probably came in right around 150,000 units.andP;  In order to break out ofthe second tier, NCR and Everex have to find a way to take market share awayfrom some far bigger competitors, starting with IBM and Compaq.andM;Share and share alikeandM;The most obvious route to increased share breaking into the large accountsthat buy the most computers - is very difficult in a mature business thatowes its whole existence to faithful adherence to a comprehensive set ofuniversal standards.andP;  Still, we would argue that possibilities fordifferentiation - whether through technology, distribution, or pricingstrategies - have never been greater.andP;  The evolution of personal computing toworkstation levels of performance is forcing widespread reevaluation ofmachine architectures, as we noted a few issues back.andP;  The dealer andreseller channels are restructuring.andP;  And we think resistance to the pricesset by IBM, Compaq, and other name brands will intensify.andP;  So it's likelythat somebody will devise strategies to take advantage of the changes thatare going on and sneak into the industry's top tier.andM;Follow the leaderandM;NCR, we think, has a chance to pull it off.andP;  Based in Dayton, Ohio, it's anorganization with roots: A tour of the product display area starts withornately decorated mechanical cash registers and progresses throughelectronic teller machines, mainframes, multiuser systems, and - oh, yespersonal computers.andM;For a while there, it did seem that personal computers were as much anafterthought for NCR as they were for most other large computer companies.andO;After failing with its initial effort to out-invent IBM with a non-standardPC, NCR retreated to a strategy of trying to be a &quot;fast follower&quot; in personalcomputers.andP;  Me idea was to come in 6 to 12 months behind the leaders and usedistribution clout to gain market share.andM;That worked for a short time.andP;  Sales of general-purpose workstations, mainlyPCs, doubled to $450 million between 1985 and 1987.andP;  But prices and saleseroded as NCR slipped further and further behind on the product developmentcurve.andP;  The company's version of a 20-Mhz 386 machine arrived a year and ahalf behind the first announcements, long after the easy sales had beenskimmed from the market.andM;Last year the strategy collapsed completely.andP;  Revenues dropped a sickening20% to $391 million, contributing to a flat sales year and a 6% decline inearnings for the company as a whole.andP;  (As the chart on Page 3 makes clear,the Workstation Products Division wasn't the only NCR product group tosuffer).andM;The last shall be firstandM;Chairman Charles Exley had already decided that personal computers were tooimportant to NCR's future to allow this kind of drift.andP;  They are, after all,a critical piece in the new corporate product strategy, known as &quot;open,cooperative computing,&quot; which - if it means anything at all - means personalcomputer networks.andM;Late in 1988, Mr. Exley sent in Tom Mays, an engineer and manager who had leddevelopment of the successful Tower multiuser system, to straighten thingsout at Workstation Products.andP;  Mr. Mays has moved on to a senior vicepresidency and responsibility for all of NCR's general-purpose computerproducts, but his legacy lives on in a restructured and re-energized personalcomputer operation.andM;No longer content to be even a fast follower, Workstation Products now triesto be first to market - or at least early - with machines based on everyimportant advance in chip technology or system architecture.andP;  More than that,NCR is finally taking advantage of its strong position inapplication-specific integrated circuits to reduce the component count in itsproducts on an accelerated schedule.andP;  And it is using the same capability topack in performance-enhancing technology that can then be sold to others,producing revenues to be ploughed back into development efforts.andM;Seeing blackandM;It's still a bit early to assess the ultimate success of this strategicturnabout, but NCR is certainly looking far better in the 486 epoch than itdid in previous generations of hardware.andP;  Both its 25-Mhz and 33-Mhz versionswere among the first and fastest 486-based machines to be announced, and NCRgeared up to start 486 shipments as early as any of its competitors.andP;  As aresult, according to some estimates, the company is winning around 20% of the486 market.andM;Of course, that is still such a small number that early performance may notmean much.andP;  But Workstation Products is finally profitable again, and AlokMohan, who runs it now, expects revenues this year to be &quot;substantiallyahead&quot; of the industry's 15% worldwide growth rate.andM;The move from late to early didn't just happen.andP;  Workstation Products hasmade substantial changes in its whole approach to product definition anddesign and has developed much closer relationships with Intel and other keysuppliers.andP;  It also seems willing to partner with just about anybody.andM;Proof that the company really has given up its bias againstnot-invented-in-Dayton technology: In what must have been a clash ofcultures, it joined with brash Advanced Logic Research to develop the first486 product.andP;  The project was finished in seven months, instead of the 12 to18 months NCR engineers were used to.andM;NCR also is also working with CIC Corp. on handwriting recognition, with GOCorp. and Slate on notebook computers, and with Teradata onmassively-parallel-processing machines.andM;Once in a blue moonandM;Another important partner, surprisingly enough, has been IBM.andP;  One of Mr.andO;Mays' first acts, after looking over NCR's competitive situation, was to optfor Micro Channel Architecture as the most likely future platform for largecorporate customers.andP;  That meant getting friendly with IBM, although in thepast, as one NCR manager puts it, 14 we didn't return each other's phonecalls.&quot; In an agreement formalized last fall, NCR got to look at future MCAdirections and in return gave IBM access to its Small Computer SystemInterface technology.andM;That was just one example of Workstation Products's new interest inleveraging the technical strength that is scattered around the company.andP;  Muchof the SCSI expertise resides in the Micro-electronics Products Division,which claims to lead the world in shipments of SCSI support circuits.andO;Microelectronics Products's latest controller chip is responsible fordoubling the usual SCSI transfer rate in NCR's 33-Mhz 486 flagship product.andO;And the division is working on a three-chip set of parts, codenamed Summit,that should chive down the cost of a Micro Channel machine by drasticallyreducing the number of components required to build one.andM;Risky businessandM;At one time, NCR would have kept this technology closely guarded.andP;  Nowadays,with development costs rising and product cycles shortening, the betterstrategy seems to be to give the personal computer side a few months leadtimeand then maximize revenues by selling the components to all comers.andP;  Becauseit uses standard cell technology, which achieves higher device densities butrequires more processing steps than gate arrays, NCR's up-front costs arehigh for complex chips like Summit.andP;  That doesn't bother NCR, which can takemore risk because it manages both the chip side and the system side of thedevelopment.andM;Few are chosenandM;Impressed though we are with NCR's new stance in technology and productdevelopment, we can't help thinking that it will all go for naught ifmarketing and distribution strategies don't work out.andP;  Like most large-systemvendors trying to make the transition to the desktop, NCR at firstoverestimated the ability of its direct sales force to compete with personalcomputer dealers.andP;  Then it overreacted by signing up hundreds of value-addedresellers and small chains without much regard for quality.andM;The latest, highly focused distribution plan cuts the number of resellersfrom 1,200 to 300 with Businessland, thanks to Compaq's temporary defection,as the focal point.andP;  Another 30 to 50 VARs cover vertical market sectors.andO;And the direct salespeople, now paid to work with resellers, go after majoraccounts.andM;Stand by meandM;With such a restricted dealer lineup, much hinges on Businessland's abilityto sort out its internal troubles and to differentiate the NCR products whilealso selling IBM, Compaq and NetFRAME machines.andP;  Mr. Mohan expects to get 25%of his indirect channel revenues from that source - a great expectationindeed.andP;  Much also hinges on NCR's ability to keep its pricing close to IBM'sand Compaq's.andP;  We think it will be hard enough for those far bigger names, inpersonal computers at least, to keep their prices high in a saturated market.andO;Only if NCR can keep pushing its technology and product development strengthsdoes it stand a chance of staying in that league.andM;CountercultureandM;Visiting the Everex facilities in Fremont, Calif., after a trip to Dayton islike a journey to another country.andP;  It's not just that Everex's founders andmany of its employees are Asia-born, or that President Steve Hui tries tocombine American, Japanese, and Chinese management practices.andP;  What'sdifferent about Everex is its culture of constant change and instantreaction.andP;  From the sea of second-hand desks manned by frantic telemarketersto the rows of cafeteria tables holding half-finished computers, Everex makesa virtue of impermanence.andP;  Everything is subject to change with little or nonotice.andP;  Of course, culture, no matter how exotic, doesn't win market share.andO;Product and distribution strategies - and the execution of same - do that.andO;We think Everex is worth watching mainly because in both of these criticalareas it is taking risks, innovating, and probably violating any number ofHarvard Business School precepts on how to run a company.andM;As any business school professor will advise you, a young company ought tofocus its activities.andP;  Everex does just the opposite.andP;  The company gotstarted in 1983 as a maker of graphics boards, and its peripherals business -including modems, memory expansion boards, disk controllers, and a line ofMacintosh scanners and printers added through acquisition - still accountsfor about a third of revenues (see the chart on this page).andM;Something for everyoneandM;Everex has also diversified its personal computer offerings.andP;  In addition toprivate label and OEM products, there is the Everex Step intended to competewith the IBMs and Compaqs of the world; Everex Tempo, a new line targeted atless-pricey brands such as AST and Dell Computer; and AGI, anotherbargain-price label aimed at Acer and Wyse Technology.andP;  Altogether, Everexmakes more than 200 separate products - potentially a logistical nightmarefor a company of its size - and sells them through one of the largest dealerand reseller networks in the industry.andM;Despite the complexity, Everex has been able to avoid inventory backups andother logistical problems and produce a fairly consistent net margin ofaround 5%.andP;  That is testimony both to its manufacturing flexibility and toits finely tuned sensitivity to the market.andP;  Mr. Hui's stated goal of &quot;zeroresponse time&quot; - finishing products as soon as they are ordered - is notlikely to be achieved completely, but Everex probably comes closer than mostcompanies to matching production to demand.andM;Empty shelvesandM;Everex avoids automation and does little offshore manufacturing out of aconviction that any gains in efficiency would be offset by losses inresponsiveness.andP;  Finished goods account for only about 10% of totalinventories instead of the usual 50% or more.andP;  If demand for one productdrops suddenly, the manufacturing lines can be switched quickly to a morepopular item with little or no inventory overhang to disturb the balancesheet.andM;None of this would mean much if Everex failed to take the market's pulseevery day.andP;  That army of 275 telephone jockeys, making up to 3,000 calls aday, provides a timely link to 12,000 or so dealers and resellers.andP;  AlthoughEverex has taken on some distributors recently, it mainly sells directly todealers - a strategy that helps margins by cutting out one level ofdiscounting and also guarantees instant feedback when market forces shift.andO;That's also a primary reason that Everex can afford to run lean onfinished-goods inventories, of course - as can its dealers.andM;Different strokesandM;About two thirds of product revenues come from VARs, a channel that is likelyto become more important for all players as personal computers get moresophisticated.andP;  Everex's big advantage with the VAR crowd, aside from solidproducts and aggressive pricing, is its product breadth.andP;  All thoseperipherals make it easy for customers to assemble a complete system out ofone price list.andM;One challenge for Everex is to differentiate its multiple product lines, atrick we're not sure can hold up indefinitely.andP;  How many Lincolns would Fordsell if people found out they came off the same assembly line as Fairlanes?andO;So far, though, Everex seems to be keeping the Step, Tempo, and AGI linesfrom bumping into each other, mainly by segregating them by distributionchannel and enforcing separate pricing, performance, upgrade, and supportstrategies for each.andM;The high cost of keeping upandM;The top-of-the-line Step machines, for example, are sold by fewer than 2,000authorized dealers and resellers, at a relatively high margin.andP;  Discountingand price advertising on Steps is strongly discouraged.andP;  Tempos, on the otherhand, are intended for 8,000 to 10,000 less-sophisticated dealers who alreadysell Everex peripherals and make their living on big discounts.andP;  The AGI lineis also discounted heavily.andM;Perhaps the biggest issue Everex faces is how to keep renewing all of itsproduct lines as the industry's design cycles accelerate.andP;  Although the Stepline has been on the market for more than two years, it is just now beingrefreshed with gate array technology needed to keep costs competitive.andO;Meanwhile, Everex has been investing in laptops, UNIX workstations, andmultiple-processor systems.andP;  Obviously, it must guard against trying to dotoo much.andM;Everex spent about $19 million on engineering and product development lastyear, which is more than some other second-tier players invest but a drop inthe bucket compared to the personal computer-related Randamp;D budgets at IBM,Compaq - and even NCR.andP;  Is Everex too small to be so broad? The answer couldbe: Not for long.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
