(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>SOFTWARE RECYCLING IS ERRICO'S DOMAINandM;Price Waterhouse's Stephen Errico wants to be known as Mr. Software Recycler.andM;Mr.andP;  Software Recycler would come into your DP center, grab your agingapplications, abstract their true value to your business and allow you toenter the abstractions in state-of-the-art Case tools, from which you canforward-generate SAA applications.andM;Only a few pieces are missing or incomplete: namely, the abstraction piece,the manipulation capability, the forward-generation piece and the ability tointegrate the steps.andM;But Price Waterhouse is working on it.andP;  Efforts are centered at Price'sApplied Technology Center in Tampa, Fla., and at Price WaterhouseTechnologies in Santa Monica, Calif.andM;Price Waterhouse has sunk from $15 million to $20 million so far into itsattempt to establish a new beachhead in the software industry.andP;  Price'sstrategy is to drive a stake into the reengineering ground, differentiatingits approach from the other Big 6 players, as well as their software,hardware and service industry competitors.andM;Price defines two sides to its effort: The Reengineering Center is a supportgroup composed of independent software suppliers working with PriceWaterhouse to provide reengineering and Case solutions; Re/Cycle is a Priceinitiative to help clients and packaged software suppliers migrate to Casetools and a development environment consistent with IBM's AD/Cycle framework.andO;Re/Cycle incorporates a software supplier alliance program, which has signedup a number of key vendors to date.andM;&quot;We are looking at $100 billion per year of systems work to correct existingsystems,&quot; said Thomas O. Beyer, chairman of Price Waterhouse's ManagementConsulting Service.andP;  The MCS, tax and audit divisions constitute Price'sbusiness.andP;  &quot;We think 20% of that will be tied up with building new systemsfrom scratch; 65% to 70% of the total market is one in which all thatcorporate management wants to do is fix the mess in data processing for thelowest possible cost,&quot; said Beyer.andM;Naturally, Price is not the only Big 6 firm seeking to make money in thesoftware business.andP;  Beyer said, &quot;We think the differentiation with Andersenand others lies in the ability to work with third-party Case companies, andin taking old software and making it more functional for a reasonable cost.&quot;andM;Price has signed or reached agreements in principle with the followingindependent software suppliers: Adpac Corp., San Francisco; BachmanInformation Systems, Inc., Burlington, Mass.; Language Technology, Inc.,andO;Salem, Mass.; Carleton Corp., Burlington, Mass.; McCabe andamp; Associates, Inc.,andO;Columbia, Md.; Index Technology, Cambridge, Mass.; Syscorp International,Austin, Tex.; and Viasoft, Scottsdale, Ariz.andP;  (See sidebar for explanation ofwhere each firm's tool fits.)andM;Two years ago, a Price Waterhouse internal strategy study concluded that thesystems reengineering market was strategic, and relatively untapped.andP;  &quot;Ourreading was that it was going to be a tools-driven market, and to becompetitive, you had to have access to a tool to gain an advantage,&quot; saidBill Hoffman, managing partner at Price Waterhouse Technologies.andM;Through a mutual employee, Price stumbled on Errico Technologies, Inc. ofSanta Monica, Calif.andP;  Headed by Stephen G. Errico, the seven-year-old companyhad been working on a process reengineering tool for three years.andP;  In October1988, Errico met with Hoffman and Robert H. Cawly, national director of PriceWaterhouse's Applied Technology Center, Tampa, Fla., and the firm's advancedsoftware engineering centers across the country.andP;  Cawly is the architect ofPrice's Vendor Alliance Program, founded in 1986, which now contributes $260million of the MCS' $600 million annual revenue stream, according to Beyers.andM;&quot;We satisfied ourselves that there was really something there, and we madethe acquisition&quot; of Errico Technologies in September 1989 for an undisclosedamount, said Hoffman.andP;  At the time, the Errico-produced tool, Arrae, couldproduce process specifications for a &quot;constrained set of Cobol and CICSprograms,&quot; he said.andP;  Since then, &quot;We have spent a lot of money on Arrae.andO;We've been adding more tolerance for historical coding approaches.andP;  We'veadded to the number of Cobol verbs we can process automatically, and expandedthe number of CICS constructs,&quot; he said.andM;The product is available to selected clients on a pilot basis.andP;  Sensitive toany perception it is hyping non-existent solutions, Price is being carefulabout specifying when Arrae will be generally available.andM;Along with Arrae, Price acquired the staff of Errico Technologies.andP;  Not theleast of the personalities brought on board is Stephen Errico himself, the6'6&quot;, 260-pound leader of Price's reengineering initiative and a partner inthe firm.andM;&quot;In talking to CEOs, I found the problem at the highest level is change,&quot;Errico said.andP;  &quot;Organizations are positioning themselves to change faster, butthe software layer is not positioned to change fast.andP;  The barrier of successfor a lot of companies is the installed layer of software; it's not softwaredevelopment.&quot;andM;Price decided to mimic IBM's AD/Cycle strategy of encouraging cooperationamong competitive software companies, within a solution framework whichincludes a means of allowing tools to communicate.andP;  &quot;We're learning a lotfrom the AD/Cycle market about the 'cooperation effect,'&quot; Errico said.andM;Errico identified the key steps needed to &quot;recycle&quot; existing software.andP;  Then,he gained the cooperation of suppliers with tools that could executeparticular steps.andP;  (See Fig.andP;  1 andamp; 2.)andM;At the Tampa ATC, Price is working on how to allow the tools in theRe/Cycling set to exchange information.andP;  While Price may need to create itsown &quot;repository&quot; to allow sharing of information between tools, the firmintends to use IBM's Repository when that software is mature and stableenough to do the job.andP;  &quot;Re/Cycle is the vehicle to AD/Cycle,&quot; said Errico.andO;&quot;But we will not waste time building black boxes.&quot;andM;Douglas Martin, director of product development at the Tampa ATC, isresponsible for integrating the tools in Re/Cycle.andP;  &quot;The good news is thatthe suppliers we're trying to integrate have all stated their intention tomove to SAA compliance.andP;  The further along they are, the easier this is todo,&quot; Martin said.andM;Most tools are moving to OS/2 and Presentation Manager platforms.andP;  &quot;As theplatforms migrate, it's easier to interchange data, because the platformhelps do that,&quot; Martin said.andM;Just having a continuing dialogue among the participating vendors is anadvantage, he said.andP;  &quot;We don't want to fulfill a requirement they alreadyhave.andP;  There's enough to do.&quot;andM;The degree of integration each tool requires with a central repositoryvaries.andP;  &quot;All the forward engineering pieces have to talk to the repositoryto get the objects,&quot; Martin said, &quot;but diagnostic tools don't necessarilyhave to talk to the repository.&quot;andP;  But if they did, simulations would be morepractical.andM;With the software industry moving toward repository-based applications, andwith the issue of whose reposutory will prevail unsettled, the industry risksconfronting a war of battling abstractions.andM;Errico said, &quot;A battle will be fought in the marketplace over whichrepresentation will be adopted.andP;  Eventually, the ability to store and sharethese objects will be established.&quot;andM;The challenge of reengineering process logic back to some abstract level ofspecification, which could be manipulated within a Case tool and thenregenerated, has been the goal of several suppliers.andP;  The most prominentefforts have been taking place at Bachman and Language Technologies.andP;  Giventhat both companies have allied with Price to become part of its toolset, itseems neither would view Arrae and Price as competitive.andM;According to Charles Bachman, chairman of Bachman Information Systems, &quot;Thisoffers us the opportunity to get exposure, and to show people how our toolsfit.andP;  To have a major company like Price Waterhouse involved is veryimportant.andP;  We at Bachman have been trying to push the theme ofreengineering.andP;  It's flattering to have Price Waterhouse come along and setup a Reengineering Center.andP;  This is evidence that broadens the big picture.andO;Maybe Case will disappear and reengineering will be the real theme.&quot;andM;Bachman has reportedly long been working on a product that would allowreengineering of source code to process logic.andP;  As to whether Arraerepresents a competitive threat, Bachman said, &quot;We've worked heavily in thearea of source reengineering with data logic.andP;  Arrae brings source code up toprocess logic.andP;  It's not overlapping with anything we do right now.andP;  Ourcustomers need a way to get from existing source code to a logical modelnow.&quot;andM;Price has put together a worldwide team to devise a reengineeringmethodology, consistent with its Systems Management Methodology.andP;  The U.S.andO;representative is Michael J. Boberschmidt of the Price Waterhouse office inPittsburgh.andM;&quot;The economics of systems development is undergoing a change.andP;  Up to now, thechoices available to people have been custom development, buy packagedsoftware, or not pursue the project because it's economically unfeasible,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;We think there is another option: reengineering.andP;  If we can bring thecost of reengineering down, we can improve the overall economics of systemdevelopment.&quot;andM;The intention of Arrae is to create higher-level abstraction of existingcode, without benefit of any existing design representation.andP;  &quot;This problemhas not previously been solved in any large-scale, meaningful way,&quot;Boberschmidt said.andP;  &quot;The product is in a very early development stage.andP;  Ithas the promise of being of substantial value.andP;  Our challenge is to prove it.andO;Our policy is not to release it until it is proven,&quot; he said.andM;On the accomplishments of Errico, who is not well known in the packagedsoftware industry: &quot;Stephen attacked a problem that he was too naive to knowcould not be solved.andP;  He fought through the problem until he had the basis ofa solution.andP;  It saved us the nine years he put in working through it,&quot;Boberschmidt said.andM;Price will train consultants in reengineering techniques under the directionof Bradford D. Rampt, the director of MCS training in Tampa.andM;Students are first taught the &quot;hand-to-hand combat&quot; method of converting Vsamfile structure to DB2.andP;  &quot;They're reengineering, but they don't know it,&quot;Rampt said.andP;  Then, they are exposed to a tool that automates at least part ofthe process.andP;  &quot;We teach them the hard way first, and then the tool,&quot; he said.andM;Not all suppliers approached by Errico have been eager to jump on board.andO;Mark Crego, president of Interport Software, Fairfax, Va., offers theIntercase tool for reengineering.andP;  This new technology, still in a raw stage,is being explored by several software suppliers for possible inclusion intheir toolsets.andP;  &quot;I have not yet decided whether to participate, because Ithink the efforts are really competitive,&quot; Crego said.andP;  He conceded, &quot;Priceis on the right track.&quot;andM;The fact that Interport recently announced a deal with KnowledgeWare inAtlanta, Bell Atlantic Systems in Arlington, Va., and coopers andamp; Lybrand inPhiladelphia, to reengineer existing applications into KnowledgeWare'sEncyclopedia, is also relevant, Crego said.andM;One skeptic of the Price Re/Cycle effort is Bill Ulrich, principal, TacticalStrategy Group, industry consultants based in Aptos, Calif.andP;  Ulrich formerlyworked within the Catalyst group at Peat Marwick, which decided to back outof the reengineering market.andP;  Peat Marwick sold its Pathvu and Retrofit toolsto XA Systems, Los Gatos, Calif., in July 1989.andM;&quot;There is much more marketing there than reality,&quot; Ulrich said.andP;  &quot;If anybodyis going to bring together those vendors under a single work-bench, I believeit has to be IBM.andP;  I have a lot of concern when I hear a Big 6 vendor saythey are going to be the integration point for that many software vendors,many of whom are competitors in the market.&quot;andM;Some 50 developers are now at work on Arrae, which is written in Cobol andAssembler.andP;  The 20 or so developers who came with the acquisition have beenjoined by 15 Price Waterhouse staff, who concentrate on supporting pilotprojects, and 10 to 15 new developers.andP;  For its new hires, Price seekstechnical skills in parser development, DB2 structures and CICS, Hoffmansaid.andM;The lead pilot project user is Tom Potts, director of customer systemsdevelopment, Duquesne Light Co., Pittsburgh.andP;  Duquesne is replacing itscustomer information system, written in Cobol over 20 years ago.andP;  &quot;Theexisting code was not extensible into the future,&quot; said Potts.andM;Duquesne is working with Price to reengineer Price's Customer Service System,a packaged application for the utility industry.andP;  &quot;Our goal was to takeadvantage of automated repositories and Case tools, to help us rebuild thecustomer information system into Cobol, CICS and DB2,&quot; Potts said.andP;  If theautomated attempts fail, &quot;we will have to engage in hand-to-hand combat withthe code we want to reposition,&quot; he said.andM;Duquesne Light is now engaged in a &quot;proof of concept&quot; exercise.andP;  According toPotts, &quot;The proof of concept is to find out whether Arrae can 'chew up' thecode, bring it into the Arrae repository and generate code out the back end.&quot;andO;Potts will test the results to see if the same function comes out as went in.andM;The code is being split between repositories within Arrae, Index Tech'sExcelerator and DB2's catalog.andP;  Thomas P. Morgan, Price's MCS partner in thePittsburgh office, developed the data model, called the Morgan Model.andP;  &quot;Wethink it's further advanced than the IBM model at this point,&quot; Potts said.andO;The Morgan Model will verify referential integrity among design objects.andM;&quot;We expect this to help us move to the IBM repository,&quot; Potts said.andP;  Duquesnemanagement supports the move to a repository.andP;  &quot;This is a core system for thecompany,&quot; he said.andM;PHASED APPROACH TO BE/CYCLINGandM;Price will pursue its Reengineering Center and Re/Cycling strategies inphases.andP;  First, Price will concentrate on conversions and migrations to IBM'sDB2; then on helping MIS organizations convert to the use of Case tools; andfinally, on moving clients to the IBM Repository, AD/Cycle and SAAcompliance.andM;In the future, those clients may include packaged software suppliersthemselves.andP;  Said Cawly of the Tampa ATC, &quot;The packaged software vendors mustcome up with a convergent product strategy, to migrate their products to thenew technologies.andP;  They will be grappling with how to get to client/server,distributed and cooperative processing, embedded SQL, SAA and otherstandards.&quot;andM;Beyers said, &quot;Pulling this off would be a major coup not only for PriceWaterhouse, but the entire software industry.&quot;andM;Role of Companion Tools in Price's Re/Cycle EffortandM;In its move into the reengineering market, Price Waterhouse allied itselfwith specific independent software suppliers, selected for their fit in acomprehensive software recycling toolset.andM;Price has convinced competitors to become allies in its Re/Cycle CompanionTechnology Vendor program.andP;  Nine companies had signed contracts or reachedagreement in principle as of early October.andP;  Price partner Stephen Errico,who leads the initiative, defined the software categories of the toolset, andhelped select the suppliers in each category.andM;The agreements call for Price to receive training and support in use of thesoftware vendor's tool, but Price will not sell the vendor's software to itsclients.andM;The following companies and tools are involved in Re/Cycle:andM;Supplier: Adpac Corp., San FranciscoandM;Category: Component inventoryandM;Tools: PMSSandM;Founded in 1966, Adpac first became known for the Adpac programming language.andO;The company concentrated on contract programming in the 1970s, often writingin Adpac and converting to Cobol under fixed-price contracts.andP;  In the 1980s,the firm began to focus on marketing its software products.andM;PMSS produces reports that inventory program and data elements, and findsredundant data names.andP;  &quot;We find literally thousands of aliases of the datanames that are allowed to propagate.andP;  We identify and clean them beforethey're placed in the repositories,&quot; said Peter Harris, Adpac president.andM;PMSS is an MVS system; over 400 licenses have been sold in four years ofavailability.andM;Supplier: Bachman Information Systems, Burlington, Mass.andM;Category: Component scan and extract; design recovery and enhancement;component recovery and enhancementandM;Tools: Bachman Data Analyst, Process AnalystandM;Bachman's tools address the design and analysis of systems, as well as thecapture of existing database designs and definitions.andP;  &quot;One Cobol programcould become 10 different pieces of process logic,&quot; said Charles Bachman,company chairman.andM;The company recently announced the Data Analyst, a product that structureddevelopment expert Chris Gane helped to design.andP;  The Data Analyst is shippingnow.andP;  Bachman announced that its Designer for CSP will be available in 1991.andO;That product targets IBM's External Source Format as a generator link fromdesign and capture tools.andP;  IBM's CSP imports design specs via ESF, which issaid to be available for licensing by other code generator suppliers as well.andO;But it's not yet clear whether any CSP competitors have been able to licensethe ESF import specs from IBM.andM;Supplier: Carleton Corp., Burlington, Mass.andM;Category: Policy/coordination management; reconstructionandM;Tools: CQS-Data EngineerandM;Carleton's products provide data conversion features used to assist intransferring information between tools, and in converting databases.andP;  Thetools can capture the internal definitions of various product dictionaries,and migrate them to different dictionaries.andM;&quot;We have a lot of good feelings about our participation,&quot; said Charles Dow,vice president of development and technical support at Carleton.andP;  &quot;You can'tconvert or transform all data in one swoop.andP;  You have coexistence once thetransformation is complete.andP;  Our products bring that to the table.&quot;andM;The Carleton products will provide Price with extract and output capabilitiesfor IBM's ESF format, he said.andM;Supplier: Index Technology, Cambridge, Mass.andM;Category: Design recovery and enhancementandM;Tools: ExceleratorandM;Index Technology, which made a name for itself by offering the ExceleratorCase analysis and structured design tool, fits into Re/Cycle in a customizedway.andP;  Using tools supplied by Index, Price Waterhouse Technologies built abridge from the Arrae tool to Excelerator.andP;  This allows component-leveldictionary definitions to be represented graphically as analysis and designspecs, drawn with Excelerator, Price's Errico said.andM;The Index tool supports eight diagram types: entity relationship, data model,data flow, structure, structure chart, state transition, work breakdown andpresentation.andM;Supplier: Language Technology, Inc., Salem, Mass.andM;Category: Existing component assessment; conditioning and translationandM;Tools: Recoder, InspectorandM;Language Technology established itself first with Recoder, the Cobol coderestructuring tool, and later with Inspector, which analyzes and rates thedegree of structure in a Cobol program based on industry-accepted standards.andM;Price will use the LTI tools to assess the condition of the existing system,as a guide to what components can be reused and which should be scrapped.andP;  Insome cases, Price may decide to use LTI's restructuring tool to improve aprogram's overall structure and quality.andM;Like Bachman, LTI has long been working on technology to abstract processlogic from existing code, in a project code-named Chrysalis.andP;  &quot;It is a Cobolreverse-engineering workbench scheduled for first customer test in December,&quot;said James Blake, LTI's business development manager.andP;  The workstation-basedproduct will provide a graphical view of the program, he said.andM;Blake did not see that any of the Price Waterhouse tools would becompetitive.andP;  &quot;Price Waterhouse does not have the technology to address whatChrysalis is going to do.andP;  Chrysalis will be the first to solve the problem,&quot;he said.andM;Supplier: McCabe andamp; Associates, Inc., Columbia, Md.andM;Category: Existing component assessment; testingandM;Tools: Battlemap, Codebreaker, InstrumentationandM;McCabe andamp; Associates president Thomas McCabe Sr.andP;  is well known for his workin software complexity metrics.andP;  The McCabe Cyclomatic and EssentialComplexity Metrics can be derived using the firm's PC-based graphics tools onexisting source code.andP;  For testing, newly released McCabe tools can be usedto produce the test plans, ranging from individual unit tests to integrationtests.andM;Battlemap can display 50,000 lines of source code at one workstation, showingthe quality of the modules and their complexity, according to McCabe.andP;  Inover three years on the market, more than 1,000 licenses have been sold forthe workstation-based product, which is priced at $21,500.andM;&quot;This is something we've developed with over 12 years of research,&quot; McCabesaid.andP;  &quot;The best analogy to it is the circuit design of hardware.&quot;andM;Codebreaker, newly announced along with Re/Cycle, is said to automaticallyidentify reusable code.andP;  &quot;You write a description of what you want, and itsearches through the code and finds a match,&quot; McCabe said.andP;  &quot;It turns themaintenance nightmare into a corporate asset.&quot;andP;  The tool can also identifyredundant modules, and design the integration test across Cobol modules, hesaid.andM;The final package, Instrumentation, also newly announced, identifies what hasand has not been tested.andP;  If a test has not been conducted, the toolgenerates a unit and integration test, McCabe said.andP;  Codebreaker is availablenow; Instrumentation will ship at a later date.andM;Supplier: Price Waterhouse Technologies, Santa Monica, Calif.andM;Category: Component scan and extract; policy/coordination management;component recovery and enhancement; reconstruction.andM;Tools: ArraeandM;Arrae is the tool Price Waterhouse acquired along with Errico Technologiesand Stephen Errico.andP;  The product is scheduled to ship in the first quarter of1991.andP;  It is available now for pilot projects.andM;The Arrae dictionary, a proprietary dictionary, serves as a &quot;componentwarehouse,&quot; Errico said.andP;  The dictionary creates, stores and manages objects;provides abstract and detail objects; supplies an ER model for existingsystem components; offers validation rules; allows for missing orinconsistent information often found in old code; and provides reusablecomponents.andM;During the reverse-engineering step, Arrae scans source code, breaks it intocomponents and loads the components into its dictionary.andP;  Parsing algorithmssearch for and match code to objects in the dictionary, such as screens, dataand logic.andP;  If the parser cannot understand a code module, it creates objectswith an incomplete status.andM;Said Errico on the process of reengineering, &quot;Existing programs mix the fourbasic 'food' groups of presentation, data, process and control flow.andP;  Theyhave to be separated; it's critical to maintain these layers.&quot;andM;In the forward-engineering stage, the components are evaluated; theincomplete objects are resolved.andP;  New functions can be defined and the datamanipulation language is changed, all within the dictionary.andP;  Certain&quot;canned&quot; or fixed routines, such as the many requirements of Vsam to DB2migration, can be called automatically.andP;  In the final generation step, thegoal is to have Arrae produce documentation, reports, and Cobol and CICSsource code.andM;Supplier: Syscorp International, Austin, Tex.andM;Category: ReconstructionandM;Tools: MicroStepandM;Reconstruction takes place after some level of change has occurred tocomponent or design specs, and the enhanced specs will be reconfigured andexecutable components generated for programs and data.andM;Syscorp provides PC-based graphics tools that generate batch and onlinesystems in C.andP;  The tools can generate compilable program logic, DB/DCinterfaces, screens, reports and data definitions.andP;  Further modification ispossible through the mouse-driven graphical interface.andM;Supplier: Viasoft, Phoenix, Ariz.andM;Category: Condition, translation;
