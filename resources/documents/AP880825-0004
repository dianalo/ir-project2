A second American soldier who was not identified received a``five-figure sum'' of money for supplying the ring with militarysecrets, said Chief Federal Prosecutor Kurt Rebmann, and Prechtelsaid two Hungarian-born brothers arrested Tuesday in Sweden withcipher keys, coded messages and radios were a part of the ring.   It was too early to know how much damage was caused to the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization, Prechtel said in an interview, butthe ring is believed to have stolen documents concerning NATOdefense plans for Europe and U.S. Army contingency plans for aground war with the Soviet Union in Europe.   Clyde Lee Conrad, the former sergeant, was arrested Tuesday, anda statement from the prosecutor's office said he was charged with``compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especiallygrave case.''   The New York Times in its Friday editions quoted officials assaying Conrad gave away information on rocket bases and a secretNATO oil pipeline in West Germany to resupply tanks. The reportfrom Washington did not identify the officials.   Conrad was born in 1947 in Ohio and worked for the U.S. militaryfor 20 years, Prechtel said. Army records list his hometown asSebring, Ohio.   He worked as an infantryman and then as an ``administrationspecialist'' during his active duty, according to his servicerecords released in Washington. Conrad received the NationalDefense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, five ArmyCommendation medals, the Army Achievement Medal, three MeritoriousService medals and seven Good Conduct medals.   Prechtel said Conrad worked with classified military defenseplans for seven years at a U.S. Army base in Bad Kreuznach, incentral West Germany, and had access to a wide array of secretdocuments. Conrad allegedly continued espionage work after he leftthe service in 1985, Prechtel said.   Rebmann said Conrad turned over the most recent batch ofinformation to his Soviet bloc contact in Vienna just last month.   Cable News Network on Thursday quoted unidentified West Germansources as saying Conrad systematically photographed files between1980 and 1985. The CNN report said investigators believe he mayhave transferred material onto a personal computer, which wasseized at his home.   Espionage cases are common in West Germany, where Soviet blocagents are active and sometimes are caught. But allegations of deepinvolvement by an American citizen in a West German-based ring areextremely rare.   An official at the U.S. Justice Department, speaking oncondition of anonymity, called the case ``a serious encroachment onour national security.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Reagan hadbeen kept informed about the investigation ``on a continuingbasis.'' But he added, ``We won't have any response or reaction atthis point. We're looking into it.''   A special panel of West Germany's Supreme Court ordered Conradheld in prison pending further investigation, Rebmann said.   Prechtel said the West German-based spy ring started in the late1970s and used couriers from Sweden.   In Goteborg, Sweden, authorities said they detained twoHungarian-born brothers who confessed to working for the Hungariansecret service.   The two men, physicians who immigrated to Sweden in the 1960s,were detained with radios, cipher keys and coded messages,authorities said. Their names were not released.   The New York Times reported Thursday that eight people werearrested by Swedish and West German in the ring operating through aGerman-Hungarian connection.   The report said investigators believe the spy ring providedU.S., West German and NATO secrets to the Hungarian intelligenceagency. The Hungarians then shared the secrets with the SovietUnion, officials told the Times.   Prechtel, speaking from his office in the city of Karlsruhe,confirmed virtually all of the Times report. But he said``several'' people were taken into custody or arrested and couldnot confirm that the number was eight.   The Times said the network was uncovered by West German and U.S.officials, including agents from the FBI and the Army. The Army hasabout 250,000 military personnel in West Germany at more than 200installations and frequently warns its personnel to beware ofSoviet bloc spies.   Rebmann said Conrad ``is under compelling suspicion of havingdelivered ... documents to a Soviet bloc secret service by means ofa command officer and couriers living abroad in return for highpayments.''   He did not identify the command officer but said the two lastmet in Vienna last month when Conrad allegedly again handed oversecret documents for payment.   After his retirement, Conrad tried to recruit other soldiers forespionage, Rebmann said.   ``He recruited another member of the U.S. Army for espionagework and paid him a five-figure sum for the delivery of militarydocuments,'' Rebmann's statement said. The type of currency was notdisclosed.   The prosecutor's spokesman declined to release any furtherinformation about the second soldier.</TEXT></DOC>
