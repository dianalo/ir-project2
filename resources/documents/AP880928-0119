The Canadian was stripped of the gold after failing a drug test,but the four major British bookmakers already had paid out by thetime the results were announced.   That means that bettors who backed American 4-9 favorite CarlLewis, who was given the gold after Johnson's disqualification,will not receive anything.   Mike Dillon, a spokesman for Ladbrokes, compared the event witha horse race.   ``Once a man is given his medal, that is akin to a horse beingweighed in. Johnson's disqualification came after the `weigh in'and, therefore, we are settling bets on first past the post,''Dillon said.</TEXT></DOC>
