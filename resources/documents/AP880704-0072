The spot price of Brent Blend, the most widely tradedinternational crude oil, jumped to $14.35 a barrel in Far Easterntrading, up 20 cents from the close of trading in New York onFriday.   But later in London, the price had retreated to $14.15 a barrel.   ``That's the usual knee-jerk reaction to anything happening inthe gulf,'' said Fergus MacLeod, an oil expert at the Londoninvestment firm Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.   An oil broker in the energy department at Shearson Lehman HuttonInc. in London, who didn't want to be identified further, said,``It didn't last. All it did was bring sellers into the markets.Since then it has been sold down.''   ``There was obviously a lot of interest from the U.S. to findout what was happening,'' she said.   MacLeod added: ``The basic perception is that unless thatincident changes the U.S. public opinion about having the fleet inthe gulf, then it won't have much impact.''   The market is still weak because of oversupply and high stocklevels, the experts said.   The broker said ``the underlying trend is bearish at themoment.''   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is producingabout 19 million barrels a day, MacLeaod said. That is far abovethe ceiling of 15.06 million barrels a day agreed to by 12 ofOPEC's 13 members in an effort to support prices at $18 a barrel.</TEXT></DOC>
