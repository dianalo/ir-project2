By late afternoon in New York, activity had practically ceased as most participants had positioned themselves for the holiday weekend. With financial markets in the U.S. and most of Europe closed today, dealers said most participants are entering the holiday weekend flat to short on dollars, underscoring the general bearishness toward the U.S. currency.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 124.50 Japanese yen, compared with 125.10 late Wednesday. The dollar also was quoted at 1.6585 West German marks, compared with 1.6635.    The U.S. currency also slipped further against the British pound, which was quoted at $1.8850, compared with $1.8755 a day earlier. The surging pound also was quoted at 3.1250 marks, compared with 3.1233 late Wednesday.    Reported intervention by the Bank of Japan and Bank of England in Tokyo and London, respectively, again provided only a brief respite for the flagging dollar, dealers said.    Although the U.S. Federal Reserve wasn't reported intervening during New York trading, the central bank was reported to be calling traders to gauge market sentiment and, as one dealer said, to ask what kind of central bank action would be needed &quot;to get the market to take them seriously.&quot;    A Fed spokesman commenting on those reports said: &quot;Doing something like that wouldn't be out of the ordinary. During any time of stress, when the dollar is under pressure or has gone up too much, we're always talking to the market.&quot;    According to many dealers, their response to the rumored Fed question would be that concerted intervention by the world's major central banks is what it takes to get the market's attention.    Lately, they said, such intervention has been on a piecemeal basis, occurring at different levels in different markets and apparently driven by the policy needs of individual central banks, not by a consensus on desirable levels of exchange rates. And so far, only the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England and the Fed have been involved, with the West German Bundesbank the most conspicuous of the many absentees.    The dollar moved in a narrow range throughout yesterday and ended the day near its opening levels. Most of the pressure on the currency came in overseas trading, where the dollar touched a six-year low against the pound.    &quot;You won't see a real market back until Tuesday,&quot; said Lou Calvello, a trader at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., referring to the four-day weekend that European dealers will be taking.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $3.40 an ounce to $454.40 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was four million ounces.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Thursday, March 31, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
