GreenbergerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LATAM MDESTMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)AEROSPACE (ARO)EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The storm surrounding Elliott Abrams, the feisty assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, is yet another of official Washington's political paradoxes: Those who would appear to benefit most from his continued presence in the State Department want him to go, while those who stand to gain from getting rid of him want him to stay.    Critics of the Reagan administration's Contra aid program, which Mr. Abrams spearheads, should want him to stay because his controversial and often contentious testimony before the Iran-Contra congressional hearings left him weakened and discredited. As long as he remains in his post, key Democratic senators and past Contra supporters such as Sam Nunn of Georgia and David Boren of Oklahoma are less likely to vote for more Contra aid.    But it is the liberal opponents of Contra aid who are after Mr. Abrams's scalp. A group of about 130 House Democrats -- nearly all of whom voted against Contra aid -- has signed a letter demanding that Mr. Abrams be fired.    On the other hand, conservatives who are deeply committed to the Contra cause should be searching for a more effective and credible champion than the wounded Mr. Abrams. With a history of razor-thin margins of victory for Contra aid, even one vote lost because of lack of faith in the messenger would be too much to risk.    Yet, Mr. Abrams has become a cause celebre on the right. &quot;Most conservatives I know believe it's essential he be retained. He's a symbol of the program,&quot; says Peter Flaherty, chairman of Citizens for Reagan.    In his testimony this month, Mr. Abrams admitted he had failed to tell three congressional panels last fall about the promised donation to the Contras from the sultan of Brunei because he &quot;lacked authority&quot; to disclose the $10 million gift. And, among other inconsistencies, he contradicted testimony by former U.S. Ambassador Lewis Tambs, saying that he didn't recall discussing an airstrip in Costa Rica with the envoy in 1985.    Mr. Abrams, noting he had apologized to the Senate Intelligence panel last December, told the Iran-Contra committee that his earlier testimony &quot;was the worst day I had in six years as an assistant secretary.&quot;    Nevertheless, says Sen. William Cohen (R., Maine), the committee's co-chairman, Mr. Abrams's combative style offered &quot;very little sense that he felt he was wrong in misleading the committee.&quot; Moreover, the December apology, coaxed out of Mr. Abrams by angry committee members, was less than &quot;inspirational,&quot; he says. The resulting distrust &quot;will have an impact on the program he's asking us to support,&quot; says Sen. Cohen, who adds he doesn't share that view.    The 39-year-old Mr. Abrams is bright but abrasive. He likes to note that he once was a top aide to Sen. Daniel Moynihan, the liberal New York Democrat, but those bridges have been burned, and Sen. Moynihan now is privately contemptuous of Mr. Abrams.    Loyalty to Mr. Abrams has become a litmus test for the right, however. He is deeply entrenched in the conservative establishment -- his in-laws Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter are respected conservative authors and editors -- and he is a bright light among neoconservatives.    Last Friday, he received a standing ovation during an appearance before Citizens for America, a conservative group.    &quot;If the Reagan people toss him overboard, they'd suffer major wounds,&quot; says Ben Wattenberg, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.    Mr. Abrams has the solid backing of Secretary of State George Shultz, who says he's doing a &quot;sensational&quot; job.    But Ronald Reagan's endorsement of Mr. Abrams is tepid. During his news conference in Venice, Italy, Mr. Reagan, referring to Mr. Shultz's comments, said, &quot;That is the administration's position,&quot; without adding his personal approval of Mr. Abrams. There are reports that White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker, who knows how to count votes on Capitol Hill, is no fan of Mr. Abrams.    And one of Mr. Reagan's top political advisers says, &quot;I doubt he'll be fired immediately, but I'd be surprised if he's there at the end of the year.&quot; This fall, the administration is expected to seek at least $105 million in Contra aid.    Unforeseen events also could intervene. The special prosecutor in the Iran-Contra scandal is investigating the role Mr. Abrams and other State Department officials may have played in aiding the Contras. Conservative columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak, barometers of the right, predict Mr. Abrams will survive the storm -- unless former National Security Adviser John Poindexter and former National Security Council aide Lt. Col. Oliver North drop bombs on him during their appearances before the Iran-Contra panel this summer.    But short of such startling revelations, this typical Washington melodrama -- without much logic to it -- will probably continue for a few more months. </TEXT></DOC>
