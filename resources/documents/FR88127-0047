The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) proposesto change a rountine use of DOE-33 ``Personnel Medical Records'' and DOE-35``Personnel Radiation Exposure Records'' to permit the disclosure of recordsmaintained in these systems to the National Institute for OccupationalSafety and Health (NIOSH), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.Currently, NIOSH is permitted access to records maintained in these systemsonly for the purpose of conducting health hazard evaluations and epidemiologicalstudies of workers at DOE's Feed Materials Production Center located atFernald, Ohio and DOE's Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant at Piketon,Ohio. This notice will permit disclosure of records maintained in thesesystems to NIOSH for health hazard evaluations and epidemiological studiesof workers at any DOE facility.Comment procedures: Comments must be received by February 26, 1988. Writtencomments should be sent to: John H. Carter, MA-232.1, Chief of Freedomof Information and Privacy Acts, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 IndependenceAvenue SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586-5955.If no comments to the contrary are received with respect to a particularproposed system, it is the intent of the DOE to operate any such systemas proposed at the expiration of the 60-day advance notice period for informingCongress and the Office of Management and Budget of proposed systems changes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</T2>:<ITAG tagnum="15">John H.

The purposesof these studies are to determine whether there are health effects fromoccupational exposure to chemical, radiation and physical hazards. TheDOE, therefore, is amending the current routine use to permit NIOSH toobtain access to exposure records maintained in DOE-33 and DOE-35 for thepurpose of conducting health hazard evaluations of workers at any DOE facility.The Privacy Act provides that, a record may be disclosed, without the priorwritten consent of the individual to whom the record pertains, pursuantto a routine use. A routine use, with respect to disclosure of a record,is a use which is compatible with the purpose for which the record wascollected. It has been determined that the proposed routine use is compatiblebecause the records are maintained for purposes of assessing workers' healthand safety and conducting health and mortality studies.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC on January 21, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Harry L.
