The guerrillas battled government forces in four provinces onSunday and fired rockets into Kabul, the capital, the governmentsaid. Nearly 280 people were reported killed in the fighting,including 12 in Kabul, it said.   The guerrillas, meanwhile, claimed Soviet aircraft were droppingnapalm on insurgent positions and said 300 government troopsdefected to the guerrillas on Saturday.   In neighboring Pakistan, a Foreign Ministry official denied areport in Sunday's editions of The New York Times that Pakistandirects the guerrillas' operations and had ordered them to attackJalalabad.   The city is 40 miles west of Pakistan, where most Afghanguerrillas are based, and 75 miles east of Kabul.   Pakistan ordered the attack on Jalalabad following a March 5meeting attended by U.S. Ambassador Robert Oakley, The Times quoteda Pakistani participant and other officials as saying. Jalalabadwas attacked March 6.   Oakley's office on Sunday referred all questions to Kent Obee,chief of the U.S. Information Service in Islamabad. Obee refusedcomment.   ``There is no truth in the report,'' said a senior diplomat inthe Pakistan Foreign Ministry, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   ``Afghans ... are very independent people. They do not takeorders from anyone regarding their own affairs, much less about theconduct of fighting in their country,'' the official said.   But diplomats in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidthere were deep divisions within Pakistan's military and governmenton whether the guerrillas should have tried to take the city, whichgovernment troops have successfully defended.   The diplomats said up to 8,000 guerrillas have died in thebattle for Jalalabad, compared to 2,000 government soldiers.   One diplomat termed the offensive a ``suicide mission.'' He saidthere were 12,000 guerrillas around the city, compared with 20,000government soldiers. The Times reported that no Afghans werepresent at the March 5 meeting of senior Pakistani military andcivilian officials. Guerrilla sources said Sunday they were unawareof any such meeting.   Pakistan is headquarters for a seven-party guerrilla allianceand its Inter Services Intelligence agency has distributed billionsof dollars in U.S. military aid to the insurgents over the pastdecade.   The guerrillas began fighting after Marxists took control of theAfghan government in a 1978 coup. Soviets troops intervened a yearlater and stayed for nine years to prop up the communists.   Shortly after Soviet forces completed their withdrawal on Feb.15, several rebel commanders said Jalalabad would be their firstoffensive.   President Najib of Afghanistan has repeatedly accused Pakistanof violating the U.N.-sponsored accord that led the way for theSoviet withdrawal.   Defense Minister Shah Nawaz Tanai, in remarks released Sunday,said: ``The Pakistani side should keep in mind that its soil willcome to lie under Afghanistan's rocket strikes.''   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said at least 265 people werekilled _ most of them guerrillas _ and 123 injured Sunday inJalalabad, Khost, Kandahar and Herat. At least 12 people died inrocket attacks in northern Kabul, official Radio Kabul reported.   The claims could not be independently verified.   Heavy fighting in Jalalabad, Khost and Kandahar also wasreported by the guerrilla-run Afghan News Agency in Islamabad,Pakistan, although it gave no casualties.   The agency did claim today that Soviet aircraft were droppingnapalm and other bombs on guerrilla positions in the Afghanprovince of Badakshan. It said there were heavy civilian losses.   Guerrillas previously have reported the use of Soviet and Indianpilots by Afghanistan. Kabul, Moscow and New Delhi all have deniedthe charges.   The guerrilla leaders also claimed that two regiments comprising300 men of the Afghan army defected to the guerrillas with a largequantity of arms in northwestern Badghis province on Saturday.   The agency also said guerrillas Friday attacked the large BagramAfghan air force base, about 30 miles north of Kabul, killing 25government soldiers.</TEXT></DOC>
