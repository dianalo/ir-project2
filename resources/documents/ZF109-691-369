 ESCON's fiber optic channels arecapable of transferring data between host processors or between a host and acontroller at up to 10 megabytes per second, which IBM says is more thantwice the speed of currently used copper cable parallel channels.andM;The fiber optic architecture of the I/O channels promises an immediateimprovement in system performance over systems joined by copper cabling, aswell as lower installation costs.andP;  IS managers say they expect that IBM's 18new ES/9000 processors, several new System/390 operating systems and enhancedversions of key system software will help them meet their need to improveproductivity and lower operational costs.andP;  IBM is shipping some of theprocessors now, while others, including the largest models, won't be shippeduntil next year.andP;  Also, some of the system software is available now, whileother parts won't be shipped until next year.andP;  But ESCON channels areavailable now, and the benefits they offer are clear.andM;The ESCON channels have made Roland Strolis, manager of systems engineeringat Boeing Computer Services in Renton, Wash., eager to climb aboard IBM'sSystem/390 train.andP;  He says the 10 megabytes per second (MBps) fiber opticchannels will provide cost savings right away.andP;  Strolis says he expects thenew technology will cut channel downtime and significantly reduce the cost ofcabling together processors and storage systems.andM;Available NowandM;Strolis and other IS managers interested in the ESCON channels and relatedconverters, controllers and adapters, won't have to wait for a new ES/9000processor to ride the System/390 express.andP;  Much of ESCON is available now asoptions for ES/9000 models now being shipped and for some predecessor Jsystems.andM;The immediate impact of ESCON, however, will be limited by the lack of a10MBps direct connection to current direct access storage device (DASD)systems, Strolis says.andP;  While connected DASD 3990 controllers are limited to4.2MBps maximum throughput, IBM says cache memory supplied with the high-end(model 3) controllers can collect data at the 10MBps rate.andP;  IBM declines tospeculate on when it may improve direct-connect throughput.andM;IBM says it will make available the ESCON adapters for its 3990 DASDcontrollers in the second half of next year, enabling throughput to rise to4.5MBps to noncached storage devices.andP;  Until the adapters become available,Strolis says, &quot;you're not going to gain a hell of a lot [of speed] beforethen.&quot;andP;  Strolis says the immediate advantage of the ESCON channels comes ingreater efficiency because they employ a serial rather than the parallelinterface.andP;  Parallel channels use protocols designed more than 20 years ago.andM;Although IBM hasn't published the serial interface specifications used withESCON, industry sources believe it uses protocols that allow for much moreefficient operation, including quicker connections.andP;  Strolis says parallelchannels spend a significant amount of time establishing protocols withattached devices and cannot be used during that time.andP;  ESCON's serialinterfaces promise quicker connections.andM;Lighten The LoadandM;The new channels use cables that are thinner, lighter and require less laborto install and maintain than the older 4.5MBps copper lines, Strolis says.andO;For instance, IBM says a one-foot length of 72-channel optical trunk cablecould weigh as little as 1.3 ounces, compared with 72 pounds for a similarone-foot length of copper trunk line.andM;Putting that difference in practical terms, Strolis says that only one personis needed to cart around the optical cable during a hardware change in BoeingComputer Service's two data centers; three are required to lug copper wire.andO;For his operations, that can amount to a considerable labor savings: in 1989alone, the unit made 1,800 hardware changes, many necessitating recabling.andM;Disconnecting and reconnecting conductive copper wire also requires takingthe affected systems down to guard against possible sparks at the connectionand power spikes in the system.andP;  The non-conductive fiber cables can behooked up without that disruption, thus increasing system availability.andM;To help make channel connection and switching easier, IBM also offers itsESCON Director systems.andP;  To operate the new technology, IBM can provide ESCONManager software which with the ESCON Director and a new version of theMVS/ESA SP 4 operating system due for release in March enables channelreconfiguration without bringing down a system.andM;Taken together, the ESCON architecture could add up to significant savings indata center operations.andM;Take, for example, a data center set up two years ago by Computer SciencesCorp. of El Segundo, Calif.andP;  Chris Magistrado, a data center specialist forCSC's Chicago office, says the cost of building and outfitting the2,000-square-foot facility came to more than $1 million, including theplumbing, power supplies and environmental controls required to support a$4.6 million Amdahl 5990 model 500 mainframe and 120 gigabytes of DASDcapacity plus DASD controllers.andP;  Copper cabling limited the allowabledistance between DASDs and processors.andP;  ESCON channels, however, let systemmanagers place the DASDs, which require less sophisticated (and expensive)facilities, in remote locations, freeing up high-priced data center space forexpansion of processor capacity.andM;Up The Optical Learning CurveandM;Boeing's Strolis says another advantage of climbing aboard the System/390train with ESCON channels is that his organization can start moving up theoptical channel learning curve, so that it's prepared to move rapidly whenhigher bandwidth channels become available.andP;  &quot;We're going to be veryaggressive in going after that technology,&quot; Strolis concludes.andM;That's not an approach everyone agrees with.andP;  Potential conversion headachesassociated with installing ESCON channels, as well as anticipatedimprovements that could outmode the just-introduced devices, mean few userswill hop on IBM's train, suggests Russell West, senior vice president atcomputer lessor Comdisco Inc. in Rosemont, Ill.andM;&quot;I see at least a full year where there's no rush to get the fiber,&quot; he says.andO;West sees real improvements only when the channel speeds reach 200MBps.andP;  Fornow, he says, the advantage comes in the flexibility the optical channelsbring to attaching systems in the computer room and in the greater distancethat can be placed between them.andM;West's thoughts echo those of another user, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.andP;  This user criticized the channel's 10MBps bandwidth, saying hiscompany is likely to need 100MBps to cope with anticipated image-processingdemands.andP;  Other observers say they expect IBM to usher in much higher datarates in the not too distant future.andM;Whatever the timeframe for using fiber optics or whatever bandwidth thechannel eventually reaches, one thing appears certain: a more flexibleapproach in configuring computer room equipment has arrived, and IBM's ESCONarchitecture has taken center stage.andM;The ESCON Building BlocksandM;IBM's ESCON architecture actually consists of several products.andP;  Theseproducts must be used in combination in order to implement IBM's vision offiber optic connectivity.andP;  The products are as follows:andM;* For current 3090 customers to use ESCON, ESCON channels as a field upgradeare available now for selected 3090 systems and are priced at $84,330 to$281,100, depending on processor size and number of channels.andM;* ESCON converter.andP;  The converter allows a System 370 parallel interfacecontroller to attach to the serial ESCON channel.andP;  Available now, model 1 ofthe converter is priced at $15,000.andM;* ESCON adapters.andP;  The adapter, which enables the attachment of an ESCONchannel to a 3990 controller, will be available in the third quarter of nextyear and ranges in price from $24,460 with two ports to $31,960 with fourports.andM;* ESCON director.andP;  The director is a hardware device that provides for I/Oconfiguration management and acts as a repeater, or amplifier, in a fiberoptic pipe at 3 kilometer intervals.andP;  Model 1, a desktop device, comes witheight ports and can be upgraded to either 12 or 16 ports.andP;  Model 1 isavailable now and is priced at $45,000.andP;  Model 2, a floor-standing device,has 28 ports and can be upgraded to 60 ports.andP;  It is available now and ispriced at $135,000.andM;* ESCON manager.andP;  The manager is a licensed program product running undereither the MVS/ESA or VM/ESA operating systems that allows for the managementof the entire ESCON architecture.andP;  The one-time license charge ranges from$7,000 to $96,000, depending on processor size.andP;  The manager is availablenow.andM;* ESCON monitor system.andP;  This system monitors environmental conditions andalso allows for unattended operations.andP;  The monitor will be available in thesecond quarter of 1991 and ranges in price from $10,000 to $17,000.andM;* Sysplex Timer.andP;
