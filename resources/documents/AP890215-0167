The Slovenian Social Democratic Union published its program inWednesday's issue of the liberal Mladina youth weekly, which saidthe party ``will strive for a peaceful transition from the country'ssingle-party (Communist) system to a system based on (Western-style)parliamentary democracy.''   It will also work for establishment of independent trade unionsin Yugoslavia and for legalization of the right to strike, accordingto the program.   Authorities in Slovenia, Yugoslavia's most liberal republic, havedemonstrated an unprecedented degree of tolerance by allowing theestablishment up of alternative political, cultural, ecological andother groups.   The first autonomous political group here, the SlovenianDemocratic Union, was formed in Ljubljana on Jan. 11. It agreed tooperate within the framework of the Socialist Alliance, aCommunist-led mass organization.   But the Social Democratic Union rejected any cooperation with theAlliance as long as it is led by the Communist Party, the party'sleading founder, France Tomsic, told The Associated Press.   ``The Social Democratic Union will strive for parliamentarydemocracy, since the social democratic program has been a part ofpolitical life in most progressive and developed European countriesfor more than 100 years,'' Tomsic said.   Yugoslav Communist leaders repeatedly have denounced the idea ofintroducing a multiparty system, claiming the parties would beformed on ethnic lines and lead to tensions and even fratricidalclashes among the country's patchwork of six republics and twoprovinces.   Zoran Polic, a hard-line member of Slovenia's Communistleadership, was quoted Wednesday by the press as saying formation ofthe Social Democratic Union ``should be decisively prevented.''   Authorities thwarted previous efforts to set up independentpolitical parties in Yugoslavia, but preparations for holding thefounding convention in a convention hall in Ljubljana continueddespite the official criticism.</TEXT></DOC>
