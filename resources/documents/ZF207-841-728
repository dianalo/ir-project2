Urtz Jr., the lab's technical director.andM;Asked what kind of hardware the lab uses, Urtz sounded like a TV car salesmenwho has whatever model you want: &quot;We bring together LISP processors forartificial intelligence, we bring together advanced workstations like Suns.andO;We've got VAXes, HPs, we have an Encore Multimax parallel architecture, we'vegot a transputer system.&quot;andM;Recently expanded to twice its original size, the lab specializes in command,control, communications and intelligence tests and demonstrations.andP;  The labis based at the Rome Air Development Center, Griffiss Air Force Base, N.Y.andM;Commands within the services and outside agencies such as the DefenseAdvanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) often fund lab projects, Urtz said.andO;Research usually is conducted in concert with contractors ranging fromprivate industry to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and otheruniversities, Urtz said.andM;The lab usually has about six different projects going on.andP;  Now it is workingon the Air Force's Advanced Planning System (APS) and Single IntegratedOperations Plan (SIOP) and a joint-services effort aimed at developing commonC2 capabilities.andP;  It also is developing a distributed operating system forthe Australian Ministry of Defense.andM;Lab researchers, along with engineers from TRW Inc., recently tested theTactical Expert Mission Planner (TEMPLAR), an artificial intelligence programthat speeded up the generation of the 9th Air Force's air tasking orders fromtwo days to 12 hours.andP;  TEMPLAR is designed to replace the completely manualprocess of picking appropriate targets and aircraft in wartime conditions.andM;Early next year the lab will begin converting prototypes of the automatedtactical planning system to fielded modules.andP;  Urtz said service officialsdecided to skip the development stage and proceed directly from prototype toinstallation.andM;The use of artificial intelligence in the APS, Urtz said, evolved over aboutten years of research.andP;  &quot;It began with what DARPA called a knowledge-basedsystem and then a natural language interface was added so that you could havea dialogue between the operator and the system,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;In time of war, atactical air control center tends to have inactive pilots on the scene tohelp out,&quot; Urtz said.andP;  &quot;What you want is a capability whereby they can learnvery quickly, and that was the impetus behind the natural language interfaceand, eventually, TEMPLAR.&quot;andM;The lab expects TEMPLAR, which has about 336,000 lines of code, to plan 1,000sortie missions in one or two hours.andP;  Urtz said it will be fielded intactical air centers in Europe, the Pacific and two bases here.andM;The Strategic Air Command's SIOP system, Urtz said, also is ripe forartificial intelligence.andM;But the lab first must remove nuclear target selection from &quot;large, slowmainframe computers that do sequential processing,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We want to seeif we can use parallel processing to speed things up.&quot;andM;Urtz said the project is very much in the experimental stage.andP;  &quot;I'm not surewe've selected the correct processor yet, but there are a number ofpossibilities -- connection machines, butterflies or multiple processorsnetted together in the same box, if you will.&quot;andM;The project with the widest range of possible applications, Urtz said, is afollow-on experiment to the development of CRONUS -- a distributed operatingsystem that the lab designed several years ago.andP;  For the Australiangovernment, the lab links several computer systems to satellite and Internetcommunications, with CRONUS added to make all the systems &quot;transparent toeach other,&quot; Urtz said.andM;The advantage of such a cluster is obvious, though more so in wartime, Urtzsaid.andP;  &quot;If you have a failure and one of the nodes in the cluster goes down,you can migrate whatever the particular process was to another availableprocessor.&quot;andM;Networked Test BedandM;The Australian system will be networked to the United States in anarrangement Urtz described as &quot;a test bed covering half the world.&quot; The testbed will allow further experimentation in &quot;how to transfer large amounts ofdata over great distances,&quot; he said.andM;CRONUS already has proven effective in a cluster of 30 different systems inthe lab, Urtz said.andM;The lab's most futuristic project, Urtz said, is a study of emergingtechnologies with C2 applications in mind.andP;  &quot;We're trying to see how we canexploit graphics, natural language interface, intelligent interface and a lotof other technologies that are beginning to multiply, and then build the C2center of the future.&quot;andM;Urtz called the recently launched, DARPA-funded project &quot;a tech push wherewe're not really being driven by a specific application.&quot;andP;  He said graphicsprobably will be a strong area of emphasis.andM;&quot;We're looking at the different types of graphic displays -- stereoscopic,volumetric or just 3-D, and different applications like terrain data mapsused in simulators, and trying to determine which processes add the mostvalue.andM;&quot;The whole idea here is that we're being faced with more and more battlefielddata and are asking if we can display that information other than innarrative form.andP;  Can we give the commander a quick snap-shot of what's goingon in the field?&quot;andM;Other projects at the C2 lab include work on the Strategic DefenseInitiatives and research into how better to link Army, Navy and Air Force C2systems to each other.andP;  Urtz said the lab also developed a mobile facility, avan housing a control computer, displays and satellite gear to transmit toRADC.andM;&quot;In very simple terms you could call it a dumb terminal that we've designedso that the main lab can do all the work without us having to drag the usersup here all the time,&quot; Urtz said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
