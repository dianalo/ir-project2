We're very frustrated.''   Geiger, who has been vice president of the union for six years,had few good things to say about one of the only educationinitiatives the president has pushed: allowing parents to choosewhich public school their children will attend.   The NEA Representative Assembly was debating the choice issuetoday at its annual convention. The 8,500 delegates were consideringseveral proposals ranging from outright opposition to qualifiedopposition to the idea of letting parents choose their children'spublic schools.   Geiger said he favored a policy that would oppose choice butallow flexibility for magnet schools, alternative schools and otheroption programs.   ``We are not going to be very supportive'' of most existingchoice programs, the president-elect said, because they do not payfor student transportation and tend to shortchange the schools leftbehind. Only one plan, in Seattle, gives money to the schoolabandoned by the student so it can improve, he said.   ``We need to raise the level of the education that's going on inall buildings, not just a few buildings and let some kids escape,''Geiger said.   What does the NEA want from Bush? Full funding of proven federaleducation programs that serve disadvantaged, handicapped andvocational students; a major presidential speech outlining Bush'seducation goals; and a presidential proposal designed to attractyoung students to the teaching profession, Geiger said.   The former math and science teacher takes office at the end ofthe summer. He said he will keep the huge union, the country'slargest and among its most politically powerful, on the path set byoutgoing president Mary Futrell.   She is widely credited with bringing teachers into the mainstreamof the education reform movement through teacher leadershiptraining, dropout prevention and literacy programs as well as arelatively flexible attitude on issues such as teacher certificationand merit pay.   ``You will not see a big about-face in this organization,''Geiger said. But he said he will push some of his own ideas,including efforts to enact collective bargaining laws in two to fourstates the NEA identifies as ripe for such action.   ``I don't believe any employee in any school district in Americatoday should be working without being under a collective bargainingagreement,'' Geiger said.   About 17 states do not have collective bargaining laws, he said.He cited Georgia as one possible site of NEA activity; an aide saidNew Mexico may also be a target.   Geiger, 48, of Livonia, Mich., won the NEA presidency with 4,870votes to 3,600 for executive committee member John Wilson ofRaleigh, N.C.   A veteran contract negotiator and former president of his stateeducation association, Geiger presented himself as tough butflexible.   Wilson, a special education teacher with a fiery style, pitchedhimself as the activist candidate and made impassioned attacks onmerit pay and ``educational bureaucrats'' in his campaign literatureand speeches.</TEXT></DOC>
