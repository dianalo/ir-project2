Merrill Lynch, the nation's biggest brokerage firm, saidfirst-quarter net income more than quadrupled from the yearearlier to $181 million, or $1.62 a share -- the company'smost profitable quarter in two years. In the year-agoquarter, Merrill earned $41.3 million, or 34 cents a share.</LP><TEXT>   Bear Stearns posted a 66% profit rise to $57.7 million, or60 cents a share, for its fiscal third quarter ended March29. Year-ago net was $34.7 million, or 33 cents a share.   Also, as expected, Charles Schwab Corp. said first-quarternet income nearly tripled to $10.6 million, or 41 cents ashare, on revenue of $186.2 million. The discount brokeragefirm said trading activity increased 47% to a record 18,900average daily trades during the quarter.   Meanwhile, Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. is to report earlynext week that its first-quarter profit rose 40% to about $35million, including increased revenue from trading commissionsand money management, people familiar with the firm said. TheSears, Roebuck andamp; Co. brokerage unit had record earnings of$109 million in 1990. Dean Witter declined to comment.   Both Merrill and Bear Stearns benefited from the stockmarket's first-quarter rebound, including profits from heavytrading of stocks and bonds using the firms' own capital.Merrill, for example, said its revenue from so-calledprincipal transactions rose 57% to a record $550 million.Meanwhile, the two firms' commission revenues soared 20%.   Merrill's total revenue jumped 18% to a record $3.15billion from $2.66 billion. Bear Stearns's revenue rose 6.7%to $626.9 million from $587.6 million.   Merrill Lynch, which shed another 800 jobs in the quarteras part of a cost-cutting program, vowed that it wouldn'trevert to the freer spending of the past.   Daniel Tully, Merrill president, said he and ChairmanWilliam Schreyer are &quot;gratified&quot; by the first-quarterresults, but will &quot;make certain the organization doesn't gettoo euphoric.&quot; At least some more layoffs are expected atMerrill. Asked about that, Mr. Tully said Merrill wouldmaintain a &quot;strong focus on the expenses and the cost side,whether it is head count or any other expenses.&quot;   So far, first-quarter earnings reports from brokeragefirms &quot;are pretty consistent: strong trading profits, anincrease in commissions&quot; and flat revenues from investmentbanking, said Lawrence Eckenfelder, a brokerage analyst atPrudential Securities Inc.   At Merrill, investment banking revenue rose a modest 6.7%to $194.9 million, reflecting a pickup in stock and bondunderwriting but a continued decline in corporate mergers.Bear Stearns's investment banking revenue was flat at $46.8million.   Despite Merrill's 25% surge in compensation costs -- whichcontributed to an 11% rise in total expenses, Merrill said ithas cut annual fixed expenses by more than $200 millionthrough the layoffs and other steps. It said its compensationcosts were up in the first quarter only because stockbrokersand others get paid more when revenue rises so much.   In a memo to employees, Mr. Tully said Merrill ismaintaining its 1991 freeze on merit raises forbonus-eligible employees. The stock market's rebound &quot;has ledto a number of inquiries about the yearlong freeze&quot; announcedin November, he said. But he noted that employees may makemore money anyway this year through higher bonuses.   Merrill, which has struggled to approach its long-termtarget of a 15% return on equity, said first-quarter ROE was21%.   At Bear Stearns, Chairman Alan Greenberg said &quot;virtuallyeverything&quot; contributed to the firm's better performance. Hesaid the firm has made &quot;dramatic&quot; strides in investmentbanking, despite the flat revenue in the latest quarter.&quot;We're just working hard and hope we can keep the momentumgoing,&quot; he said.   Meanwhile, Merrill named Thomas W. Davis, a 37-year-oldinvestment banker, to head an expanded equity-transactionsdepartment. The department, which will combine theorigination and trading of new stock offerings, was formed tomeet &quot;the significant demand for world-wide equity which wewill see over the next decade,&quot; said David Komansky,Merrill's head of global equity markets.</TEXT></DOC>
