KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan's plan to pay humanitariancompensation to the families of the 290 people killed in the U.S.destruction of an Iranian jetliner last month faces serious hurdlesin Congress and may not be approved, House members said Thursday.   ``I think you're going to have serious trouble selling whatyou're trying to sell,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., told Stateand Defense department officials.   Skelton said the Iranian government bears a heavy burden ofresponsibility for dispatching the Iran Air Airbus into a PersianGulf combat zone where it was destroyed by missiles from the U.S.cruiser Vincennes.   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed ServicesCommittee, told reporters that Congress might be persuaded toappropriate funds for humanitarian compensation to the families ifit is established that mistakes by the Vincennes crew during combatcaused the downing of the plane.   Pentagon sources said Wednesday that preliminary findings of anofficial investigation show that human error rather thanmalfunctioning equipment caused the Vincennes to fire on thejetliner July 3.   Aspin told State and Defense department witnesses at the hearingthat they face ``a tough sell'' in obtaining compensation fundsfrom Congress because ``the visceral reaction against the Iraniangovernment runs very deep.''   Aspin said the chances for approval of compensation would be alot higher if there is an end to the eight-year Iran-Iraq war andto attacks on international shipping in the gulf.   Several committee members said they would oppose payingcompensation unless there were ``absolute guarantees'' that themoney would go only to victims' families and not benefit theIranian government in any way.   ``While we want to be humanitarian, we don't want to be naive,''said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.   Aspin added: ``Unless there are absolute guarantees there aregoing to be absolute problems.''   Abraham Sofaer, the State Department's legal adviser, said theoffer to pay compensation flows from a traditional American spiritof compassion and humanity.   He said all nations except the Soviet Union have paidcompensation after the destruction of a civilian aircraft because``civilized nations pay these kind of obligations.''   Safaer said he believes it would be ``inappropriate'' to linkhumanitarian payments to other issues, such as the release ofhostages held by Iranian-backed radicals in Lebanon.   ``This is not a nation-to-nation deal,'' Sofaer said. ``This isa nation-to-people deal.''   He said the United States will make every effort to ensure thatTehran government does not benefit from the payments.   ``We are going to pay this money to people or we're not going topay it,'' Sofaer said.   He said, however, that cooperation from Iranian authoritiesprobably will be essential if the victims' families are to beidentified accurately and appropiate payment made.   He said that if there were no cooperation and survivors provedimpossible to identify with certainty, that likely would end thematter.   Even with the administration's best efforts, Sofaer testified,``we will need a considerable amount of time to determine how toassess compensation and to obtain the information necessary fromthe families or their governments.''</TEXT></DOC>
