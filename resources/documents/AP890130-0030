Catherine Mary Kampen said Swaggart gained her trust as aspiritual adviser, then emotionally manipulated her into acting outhis sexual fantasies, the magazine said in its March issue.   ``The whole thing's made up,'' Swaggart attorney's Phillip A.Wittman said Sunday.   Wittman said Swaggart would file a libel lawsuit, probably thisweek, against the men's magazine.   ``Jimmy Swaggart doesn't even know Miss Kampen,'' said Wittman.``He's never met her, never seen her.''   Wittman said Swaggart was returning home to Baton Rouge from aweekend crusade in Atlanta.   According to Penthouse, Swaggart approached Kampen, a homemakerand performer of striptease telegrams, at a roadside telephone inJuly 1987.   Kampen said Swaggart told her he could help her with her marriageand personal life, and promised to help her financially whiledemanding she perform sexual acts for him.   Like Debra Murphree, the prostitute whose account Penthousepublished in July, Kampen claimed that Swaggart asked her to performexplicit sex acts while he watched.   Murphree said Swaggart wanted her 9-year-old daughter to watchthem have sex; Kampen said the evangelist asked to have sex with her13-year-old daughter.   Like Murphree, who said she was involved with Swaggart fromOctober 1986 until October 1987, Kampen claimed she posed forSwaggart but kept her daughter away from him.   Unlike Murphree, who said she and Swaggart attempted to have sexone time, Kampen told the magazine she and Swaggart never had sexduring their six-month relationship.   She said she asked him if he wanted to.   ``And he said, `Oh sure, but that would be cheating. What we'redoing here is just playing _ it's fun and games, it's not cheating.You understand that, don't you,''' Kampen quoted Swaggart as saying.   Wittmann said his law firm conducted its own investigation of theallegations after Penthouse asked about them more than a month ago.   ``We advised Penthouse that in our view the story was afabrication, and we were under the impression that they were notgoing to release the story,'' he said.   ``They in fact had asked us for further information which we werein the process of assembing for them,'' said Wittmann, adding thathe was shocked the story had been published.   Last February, Swaggart confessed that he had sinned against hischurch and his wife, but never gave specifics.   Murphree has said Swaggart was talking about her, but Kampen saidshe thought Swaggart was talking about her.   Swaggart was defrocked by the Assemblies of God in April becausehe disobeyed the Pentecostal denomination's order that he not preachfor a year and returned to the pulpit three months later.</TEXT></DOC>
