The agreement, which the House Banking Committeeincorporated into banking legislation it's drafting, wouldn'tcompromise the Fed's authority to meet short-term liquidityneeds of the financial system or to operate as a lender oflast resort. But the change would restrict the central bank'scurrent flexibility and expose decisions the Fed and otherregulators make to support failing banks to increasedcongressional scrutiny.</LP><TEXT>   The Fed regularly makes loans through its discount windowto banks with short-term reserve or liquidity needs. Lessfrequently, the central bank makes extended loans to weakbanks struggling to regain their financial strength. BankingCommittee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) has complainedthat extended credit often props up banks that should fail,thus allowing losses to mount and increasing the costs thatthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. bears when a bank goesunder. Currently, any discount loans are repaid to the Fedwhen a bank fails, boosting the FDIC's cost.   The agreement would require the Fed -- not the FDIC's bankinsurance fund, which is financed with premiums paid by banks-- to pay the cost of certain long-term loans to sickinstitutions. Since the Fed turns over all its excessrevenues to the Treasury, this means that, in limited cases,taxpayers rather than the banking industry would bear thecost of extended support.   Under the agreement, if the Fed were to extend credit formore than 60 days to a bank that doesn't receive regulatorycertification of being able to maintain capital above aminimum level of up to 2%, it would bear the cost if the bankfailed.   Fed and banking industry officials stressed that thecompromise would be part of a new regulatory structureCongress is crafting to reduce bank failures and limit coststo the FDIC when banks do fail. Last week, the panel adoptedmeasures that would force banks to improve their financialcondition when their capital declines. In addition, it votedto prevent the FDIC from reimbursing depositors for uninsuredaccounts-those above the current insurance limit of $100,000and foreign deposits. The changes were designed to reduce thedrain on the dwindling deposit insurance fund and reducechances that taxpayers would have to bail out the fund.   Under the compromise, if the Treasury determines it'snecessary to pay off the depositors to protect the financialsystem from a &quot;systemic risk&quot; of panic, the Treasury wouldbear the cost of paying off uninsured depositors. Currently,when regulators reimburse uninsured depositors to preventsystemic risk -- as they did when the Bank of New Englandfailed in January -- the bank insurance fund bears the cost.Since the fund, which is running out of money, is supportedby banks, the banking industry has been working hard insupport of a compromise to limit the industry's exposure.   The new provision would take effect two years after thebanking law passes. Although the broad banking proposal facesmany obstacles, Congress is almost certain this year to passproposals to revise and bolster the deposit insurance systemand tighten bank regulation.   &quot;This amendment could save the government money because itwouldn't keep banks open as long&quot; in unsuccessful attempts toavoid failure, said Robert Dugger of the American BankersAssociation.   The Fed agreed quickly, but somewhat reluctantly, to thecompromise after the banking committee released a studyshowing that extended discount-window borrowing often doesn'thelp banks avoid failure. The study showed that 320 bankswere borrowing at the time of failure and that they hadoutstanding loans of $8.33 billion at the time they failed.   &quot;The Federal Reserve is tightening up on practices thathave given us much concern,&quot; Mr. Gonzalez said.</TEXT></DOC>
