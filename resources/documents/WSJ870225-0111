New Orleans-based Freeport said that proceeds from the sale would help repay the estimated $750 million cost of Freeport's acquisition of Petro-Lewis Corp. and allow Freeport to manage its remaining properties more efficiently. The reserves being sold include properties of Petro-Lewis, Freeport, and a partnership it manages called Freeport-McMoRan Energy Partners Ltd.    Graham Royalty, a unit of Graham Resources Inc., said it bought the reserves on behalf of income funds sponsored by itself and Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Graham Royalty officials said the properties they bought have current daily production of about 7,300 barrels of oil and 72 million cubic feet of natural gas.    The proposed reserves sale is the second such transaction announced by Freeport in recent days. The company said Friday that its 72%-owned Petro-Lewis unit had agreed to sell $140 million in California oil and gas reserves to Santa Fe Energy Co., a unit of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. of Chicago.    Altogether, the oil and gas reserves being sold in both transactions are equivalent to 70 million barrels of oil, Freeport said. After deleting reserves included in these transactions, Freeport said that its oil and gas reserves, as of Dec. 31, would have totaled about 163 million barrels of oil equivalent. A year earlier, before Freeport acquired a controlling interest in Petro-Lewis and its American Royalty Trust affiliate, Freeport's oil reserves totaled the equivalent of 111 million barrels. </TEXT></DOC>
