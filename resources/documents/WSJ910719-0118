Nahum Vaskevitch, who was fired by Merrill Lynch in March1987 because of the alleged insider-trading scheme, wascharged with one count of conspiracy and 44 counts of fraudin an indictment brought by the U.S. Attorney's office inManhattan. The allegations are similar to those made in acivil suit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission inMarch 1987.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Vaskevitch, 41 years old, was arrested last weekend inCyprus, the U.S. Attorney's office said. But he fledauthorities after being released by a judge in Larnaca,Cyprus, and currently is being sought for extradition to theU.S.   Prosecutors said that for the past several years, Mr.Vaskevitch, an Israeli citizen, has been living in Israel,which has a law barring the extradition of Israeli nationals.   Gerald Harris, an attorney for Mr. Vaskevitch, said hehadn't seen the indictment and declined to comment.   The indictment, filed under seal in March 1991, accusesMr. Vaskevitch of taking part in a scheme that allegedly made$2.2 million in illegal insider-trading profits. Theindictment alleges that Mr. Vaskevitch, through his job,obtained confidential information about mergers and otherbusiness transactions, and then passed on the information toan unidentified co-conspirator who controlled brokerageaccounts in New York City. The co-conspirator, who wasn'tcharged in the indictment, then traded on the informationbefore the deals were publicly announced.   The transactions included W.R. Grace andamp; Co.'s sale ofHerman's Sporting Goods Inc. in 1986, Kmart Corp.'sacquisition of Pay Less Drug Stores Northwest Inc. in 1985and Marriott Corp.'s purchase of Saga Corp. in 1986.   The indictment said the alleged insider trading in theKmart deal made total profit of $1.2 million.   The indictment doesn't say how the alleged illegal profitwas split. In the SEC suit, however, Mr. Vaskevitch wasaccused of taking payments of $1 million from the scheme.   David Sofer, a businessman in Jerusalem, was named as aco-defendant in the SEC case. The SEC accused Mr. Vaskevitchof leaking the information to Mr. Sofer, who allegedly tradedon the information through his accounts in the U.S.   The SEC in 1988 won a default judgment of $3.7 millionagainst Mr. Vaskevitch and Mr. Sofer. Some of Mr.Vaskevitch's assets were seized by the government, but theentire amount sought under that judgment hasn't yet beenattained.   As previously reported, Mr. Sofer struck a deal withgovernment investigators in April 1987 that called for him torepay all of his allegedly illegal profit of $2.7 million inreturn for immunity from prosecution.   Mr. Vaskevitch, if convicted, could face a maximum fine of$10,000 on each count and a substantial prison sentence.   ---   NON-REFUNDABLE RETAINER invalidated by judge.   A state judge in New York has ordered Joel R. Brandes, amatrimonial lawyer, to return most of a $15,000 retainer heaccepted from a client for whom he did fewer than five hoursof work.   When the client, Susan Zingmond, hired Mr. Brandes as herattorney, she signed a document agreeing to pay a minimum feeof $15,000, a sum &quot;not to be returned. . . . under anycircumstances,&quot; according to the agreement.   Shortly thereafter, she reconciled with her husband andended the divorce proceedings. Mr. Brandes had spent only 4.2hours on the case after signing the agreement, but heinsisted he had a right to keep the retainer.   In a harshly worded opinion, Supreme Court Judge M.Hallstead Christ called the charge &quot;clearly excessive&quot; andsaid the very concept of a non-refundable retainer&quot;impermissibly chills a client's absolute right to dischargecounsel.&quot; To allow Mr. Brandes to keep the retainer afterdoing less than five hours of work &quot;would be to lend judicialapproval to an hourly rate of $3,571.43,&quot; he wrote.   Mr. Brandes was unavailable for comment yesterday. CaroleWeidman, his partner in the New York law firm of Brandes,Weidman andamp; Spatz, said he was considering an appeal. Mr.Brandes no longer uses non-refundable retainers in hispractice, she added.   Several New York matrimonial lawyers, including NormanSheresky and Raoul Felder, decried the court's decision.   &quot;The courts are monkeying a bit too much in privatearrangements,&quot; Mr. Felder said. &quot;If a lawyer resolves a casevery quickly, he's penalized&quot; by the prospect of having torefund a retainer, he added.   ---   HOSPITAL SUED FOR FAILING to inform woman about abortionoptions.   A 21-year-old woman who gave birth to a severely retarded,premature son has sued Yale-New Haven Hospital formalpractice, because her physician had failed to inform herthat she could obtain an abortion in New York through her24th week of pregnancy. The woman was prohibited from havingan abortion in Connecticut under that state's law.   In the suit, first disclosed in the National Law Journal,Deborah El-Amin argues that her physician violatedConnecticut's informed-consent law, which requires doctors totell their patients about the known risks of medicalprocedures and viable treatment alternatives.   In May, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld governmentregulations prohibiting federally funded clinics fromproviding abortion information. The court ruled that the lawdoes not violate the free speech of doctors or women's rightsto abortion. While not directly related, the Connecticut casecould shed light on whether doctors have an obligation toinform patients about their abortion options.   &quot;It's extraordinarily unfair to expect a physician tounderstand what the laws are in every state, especially in anarea as volatile and constantly-changing as abortion,&quot; saidVirginia D. Roddy, director of legal affairs for Yale-NewHaven Hospital.   Michael P. Koskoff, who represents Ms. El-Amin in thecase, pending in Superior Court in New Haven, compared hisclient to a patient requesting a heart transplant. &quot;Even ifthey didn't have the ability to do the operation in hisstate, they wouldn't keep information about the procedurefrom him -- they'd find another state,&quot; he said.   When Ms. El-Amin entered Yale-New Haven in June 1988, shewas suffering from chorioamniatis, an infection that can befatal to a mother and her fetus.   Ms. El-Amin's doctor determined that the fetus was viableand therefore, under Connecticut law, he could not perform anabortion. In her suit, Ms. ElAmin contends that the physicianshould have told her that she could legally obtain anabortion in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
