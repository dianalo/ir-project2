The focus is on those DOE nuclear and nuclear-relatedtechnologies which could make significant contributions to military programsin other countries. The study examines several mechanisms which are viewedas important avenues for technology transfer, (i.e., visits assignments,and foreign travel; public releases; international activities; and clandestineacquisition). The input of various DOE program offices and laboratorieswas elicited. This provided the benefits of each organization's expertisein technology controls. Moreover, the responsibilities and programs ofother US government agencies involved in technology controls were examinedin conjunction with DOE's area of responsibilities.</TEXT></DOC>
