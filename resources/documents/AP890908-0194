The suit is among 35 civil actions filed by the government in1987 to recover the billions of dollars Marcos and his associatesallegedly embezzled before he was ousted in 1986 and forced intoexile in Hawaii.   Solicitor Gen. Frank Chavez said he hoped the trial wouldconvince courts in Switzerland and elsewhere to speed up proceedingsto recover money that Marcos allegedly stashed abroad.   Government lawyers said they will show that Marcos and his wifeImelda owned properties worth far more than they could afford onincome declared in tax returns.   Eliseo Pitargue, intelligence chief of the Bureau of InternalRevenue, testified that between 1960 and 1984, the couple declaredtotal assets of $657,000.   The government claims Marcos and his friends embezzled up to $10billion.   President Corazon Aquino has refused to allow Marcos to return tothe Philippines, citing national security. Marcos is reported incritical condition at a Honolulu hospital, where he has beenconfined since January with heart, kidney and lung failure.   Marcos and Imelda were indicted by a U.S. federal grand jury in1988 on racketeering charges. But they have not been criminallycharged in the Philippines because the constitution allows them toreturn to face their accusers.   Meanwhile, a Marcos spokesman returned to the Philippines onThursday after quitting his job and giving up an appeal for asylumin the United States.   Guillermo ``Gemmo'' Trinidad, 45, arrived on a flight fromHonolulu. Officials said there were no charges pending against him.   Trinidad entered the United States in March 1986 on a touristvisa, one month after Marcos was ousted in a popular uprising andforced into exile in Hawaii.   After the Immigration and Naturalization Service begandeportation proceedings against him in January for overstaying hisvisa, Trinidad applied for political asylum, claiming his life wouldbe in danger in the Philippines.   His attorney, Ronald Oldenburg, said Trinidad withdrew theapplication for political asylum Tuesday and the U.S. granted him avoluntary departure order, meaning the deportation proceedings wouldbe suspended.   Also Thursday, Mrs. Aquino said there would be ``no whitewash''of a congressman accused of gun smuggling. She defended her brotheragainst rumors he was involved.   Customs agents at Ninoy Aquino International Airport seized 314handguns and rifles from baggage allegedly belonging to Rep. Nicanorde Guzman and businessman Ponciano Datu, who arrived Tuesday on aflight from San Francisco.   De Guzman, a member of the pro-Aquino Struggle of the DemocraticFilipino party, denies the weapons were his. De Guzman went onindefinite leave without pay Thursday pending the outcome of theinvestigation.   ``I will be sharing with you whatever reports come in to assureyou that definitely there will be no whitewash,'' Mrs. Aquino saidat a news conference.   Mrs. Aquino also said her politically powerful brother Rep. JoseCojuangco Jr., assured her that he was not involved in gunsmuggling, as some Manila newspapers alleged.   Opposition politicians and several newspapers claim Mrs. Aquino'srelatives are guilty of the same brand of influence-peddling thatwas rampant under Marcos.</TEXT></DOC>
