(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The LAN CrewandM;LAN implementation and support are major issues today in industries, fromfinance to agribusiness, regardless of the organization's size.andP;  Traditionalsystems management has often been at a loss to cope with the newtechnological scenario.andP;  To harness LAN technology across the board, one mustunderstand LAN technology itself as well as organization and managementapproaches that emphasize human resource factors.andP;  Consideration of onewithout the other is insufficient.andP;  This balanced approach seeks to avoidlopsided perspectives that are not unusual in modern technical management,and are particularly devastating in the LAN field.andM;Architectural ScopeandM;The scope of LANs has expanded tremendously during the past five years.andO;Their breadth is reflected by the three logical subdivisions which areimportant in organizing LAN implementation and support: departmental LANs,enterprisewide LANs, and global networks.andM;Departmental LANs and the LANs of small- to medium-size companies have muchin common.andP;  They are the &quot;real&quot; LANs, the basic building blocks for moreextensive configurations.andP;  Departmental LANs consist mainly of workstations,file servers, and print servers.andP;  Occasionally more specialized devices suchas communication gateways, wayl servers, database servers, and bridges areincluded.andP;  Depending on the size of the LAN, cabling could be simple orsophisticated, temporary or permanent.andP;  The LAN is usually formed from asignle ring or segment, although sometimes multiple segments are used tocover a spread-out area.andM;Departmental LANs fall within the domain of the LAN administrator, who is themanager of the LAN.andP;  This involves a variety of responsibilities, includingplanning, design, operational support, and applications support.andO;Administration sometimes includes applications development, security, andcoordination of technical resources.andP;  At worst, the LAN administrator mustcall for help; at best, he is a hands-on, minidata processing manager.andM;&quot;It has been an ongoing battle to integrate the LAN with a sophisticatedworkstation environment,&quot; says Kevin Sheehan, a LAN administrator ofNetWare/Token Ring LANs on Wall Street.andP;  &quot;The greatest challenge is workingwith MIS to exapdn application functionality far beyond the departmental LANtoward global LAN conectivity that supports worldwide revenue generatingoperations.&quot;andM;Departmental LANs are highly visible to users at their workstations.andP;  Inorder to plan and implement a network successfully, the LAN administrator andkey users must draw on the expertise of LAN gurus.andP;  These gurus might befound in the guise of other highly experienced LAN administrators, inhouse oroutside consultants, expert personnel of LAN service vendors, or a centralLAN service group under the MIS umbrella that functions as an objectiveinternal consulting organization.andM;Small companies most likely rely on part-time, external consultants who arewilling to work for a support fee or on an hourly basis.andP;  Departments inlarge companies require dedicated and sophisticated support that is permanentor immediately available.andP;  Permanent consulting staff and retainerrelationships are the norm.andM;Highly expert, reliable support personnel who can (and want to) work in thefield are hard to come by.andP;  Such personnel provide technical support to manydifferent LAN administrators and/or attend to different departmental LANs onshort notice.andP;  such &quot;short-order support&quot; is likely to be an intensiveexperience with emphasis on problem-solving and troubleshooting.andM;Large companies occupy a lot of building floor space.andP;  hole buildings orlarge portions of a single building might contain many organizationalcomponents, i.e., departments.andP;  Company-wide connectivity can be attained byinterconnecting the individual department LAN segments or rings via LANbridges.andM;There are economic and management incentives for connecting all datacommunication devices to the enterprisewide LAN.andP;  The objective is to provideshared connectivity resources across many departments.andP;  &quot;Enterprisewide LANsare an any-to-any connectivity facility that must be flexible in the dynamicbusiness environment,&quot; says Marc Holstein, an expert in connectivity solutiondesign.andP;  &quot;They must allow moves and changes between the business unitswithout impacting the connectivity infrastructure.andP;  The bottom line is thatenterprisewide connectivity lends itself to transparent integration ofbusiness functions on an interdepartmental basis across the entire company.&quot;andM;Some communication devices attach directly to the LAN: Gateways for access toasynchronous, X.25, SNA, and TCP/IP services; remote LAN-to-LAN bridges usinguniform protocols, such as NetBIOS, IPX/SPX, or MAC; multiprotocol LAN-to-LANbridges; long and short haul routers; mainframe computers via front-endcommunication controllers, e.g., IBM 37X5; and mid-range processors(minicomputers) and control units, i.e., IBM 3174s.andP;  Most of these devicesconnect to the backbone ring or to specialized isolation rings bridged to thebackbone.andP;  Others, such as 3174 control units, are normally attached todepartmental rings.andM;The result diamatically impacts each department's LAN capabilities.andP;  Afterthe connectivity structure is in place, the available services must be madeknown to LAN administrators across the enterprise.andP;  Once LAN administratorsget the hang of the enterprise LAN, they can innovate.andP;  For example, LANadministrators running NetWare may want to exchange data across theenterprise with other LAN administrators who are running IBM/Microsoft LANoperating systems, and vice versa.andP;  Or perhaps administrators want to provideusers access to NetWare and IBM/Microsoft servers at the same time.andM;Enterprisewide LANs often involve multiple hardware types and upper-layerprotocols.andP;  They can be connected building-to-building with LAN-to-LANbridges and fiber-optic links.andP;  Remote LAN-to-LAN bridges are a good way tofacilitate building-to-building connections over a wide areea, usingdedicated links when economically feasible.andM;Designing and implementing the enterprisewide LAN requires a broad range ofexpertise.andP;  All network disciplines within the enterprise must be tapped.andP;  Acentral network group within MIS and/or an outside consulting firm usuallydoes the planning and design.andP;  The substantial investment certainly mandatescareful review before beginning implementation.andP;  Some connectivityinstallation work, such as installing the cable plant, can be contracted tooutside firms.andM;International companies with major locations throughout the world want tolink LANs together worldwide.andP;  Some LANs are extensive and complex; othersare very simple.andP;  Connectivity must be built through direct links or throughwide area network (WANe facilities, such as public or private data networks.andO;Linked LANs across the globe mean that the data in a LAN application at onelocation may be accessed worldwide.andP;  WAN expertise dominates this frontier inglobal data communications.andP;  Inhouse LAN and WAN experts must work togetherwith outside service providers in rowing the connectivity boat towardglobally lined LANs.andM;PlanningandM;In the real estate business, the emphasis ofr successful investment is saidto be &quot;location, location, location.&quot;andP;  In LANs, the emphasis is &quot;planning,planning, planning.&quot;andP;  The planning process is oriented toward design anddelivery of a cost-effective business solution, and it follows a patternlargely inherited from traditional systems analysis.andP;  When planning iscompleted, it is always evidenced by a written document or documents.andO;Realism in planning is one of the most important factors required to producegood documentation.andM;LAN and other systems technology plans must be in concert with the strategic,tactical, operational, and special project plans of the company or businessunit.andP;  In addition, the schedules for technological deliverables requirecoordination to ensure that the technology is in place when needed to supportrealizatiuon of the business objectives.andP;  The business and technology plans,however, each tend to go their own way.andP;  the critical elements of planningfor LAN technology are outlines below.andM;Needs Analysis: Th business needs must be clearly defined in the language ofthe businessperson.andP;  Sensitivity to the business need driving the requirementvastly incrases the probability that the system will serve the users and thebusiness, rather than vice versa.andP;  Assessing the business need involvesidentifying the business problem or problems by interviewing a spectrum ofcompany personnel, objective data gathering and analysis pertinent to theproblem, and thoroughly reviewing company operations.andM;Applications Focus: Computers exist for applications.andP;  The business need issatisfied through application systems that are supported in a particularcomputer system environment.andP;  Before the system environment can be defined,the analyst must have an idea of which applications will be run, whetheroutside vendor packages will be used, and/or whether custom systemsdevelopment will be neeed.andP;  Applications currently in use might have to bemodified, replaced, or migrated to a different system platform.andP;  Sometimesnew directions in application systems must be defined to establish asufficiently cost-effective computing environment to enhance the competitiveposutre of the firm.andM;Computing Environment: The application systems are the prime factors thatdetermine the computer environment.andP;  The majority of applications run on thepervasive microcomputer-based LANs.andP;  While this is the ideal computingenvironment available today, it cannot exclusively support all applicationrequirements or application systems.andP;  Billions of dollars are invested inmainframe and minicomputer hardware, software, and data.andP;  Certain specializedapplications have been developed to run on onl one or a limited number ofplatforms.andP;  Fortunately, it is routinely feasible for all computers to beattached to the enterprisewide LAN.andP;  Even if microcomputers are not theplatform of choice for a particular application, LAN technology is stilllikely to be an important part of the solution.andM;LAN Design and Configuration: Many questions concerning hardware, software,cabling, topological layout, bridges, communication links, and security mustbe answered.andP;  These take into account all of the elements of LAN planning.andO;Some issues from a seemingly endless list are as follows by departmental,enterprisewide, and globally linked LANS.andM;Departmental LANs: Decisions include the type of LANs used, network operatingsystems preferred by the department, the number and type of workstations andservers planned and the serverhs speed and capacity in terms of disk storageand concurrent use (e.g., workstation requests per minute).andP;  Also, thestandard workstation software must be decided, if there will be a standardfor each type of user at all.andP;  Will the workstation have a PresentationManager, Windows, New Wave, Saber interface, or a simple menuing system?andM;Enterprisewide LANs: Issues include the cable type, the logistics of thecabling plant, how rings or segments are bridged, and whether the bridges arecontrolled centrally or decentrally.andP;  The planners must decide which deviceswill be directly LAN-attached, if there will be mainframe communication frontends (and if so, how many Token Interface Couplers per front-end device), andhow many minicomputers, control units, personal computers, and Unix-basedservers and workstations.andM;Are there interoperability requirements that demand special connectivity,such as Token Ring to Ethernet bridges?andP;  Where should isolation rings beplaced?andP;  Which communication protocols will be used throughout theenterprise?andP;  What type of local and remote LAN-to-LAN bridges and data linksare required?andM;Other issues include configuring redundant and backup communication paths,deciding backup and recovery provisions, setting up network administration,evaluating security risks and measures, and potential bottlenecks and trafficloads.andM;Globally Linked LANs: Evaluate the types of traffic and protocols,performance requirements, line speed and quality.andP;  Then decide if theeconomics favor remote LAN-to-LAN MAC layer bridges, long-haul routers, orsatellite services.andP;  Are dedicated data links justifiable, or must the LANsbe linked through public or private packet switching networks?andP;  What aboutISDN?andM;Identify the key transport issues.andP;  Determine which type(s) of routing shouldbe used and if multiplexers play a role.andP;  How must the applications bestructured to ensure adequate performance across the global network?andO;Evaluate if it is feasible to deploy advanced technologies, such as databaseservers and superserver platforms to support the globally sharedapplications.andP;  If so, determine the advantages and if they are sufficient tojustify the investment.andM;Capacity Planning: Identify potential bottlenecks that are likely to impactperformance sooner or later.andP;  Generally, capacity restraints are not due tobandwidth limitations.andP;  The most common bottlenecks are server I/O, serverfile systems, network adapter I/O, gateway capacity, and vendor limitationson the number of users.andM;Communication Links: The WAN experts will consider dial-up, dedicated lines,and X.25 interfaces for interconnection through public or private packetswitching networks, ISDN, fractional T-1, E-1, CEPT, T-3, satellite, andmicrowave.andM;Systems Integration/Interoperability: Once the connectivity groundwork islaid, the next objective is interoperability.andP;  Interoperability at thenetwork operating system level is fairly straightforward.andP;  A more challengingsystems integration feat is tying together systems running on Ethernet withsystems running on Toker Ring to form a logically seamless, distributedcomputing application.andM;Application Development: If custom applications are likely to be developed,then design consideration must be given to LAN resource functionality,process-to-process communication, application programming interfaces, andother communication-oriented LAN facilities.andP;  It is imperative to acceleratethe education of application development personnel after finishing theplanning process.andM;Advanced Technology Deployment: Use of advanced technology should beconsidered in the strategic technology plan.andP;  The capabilities and costeffectiveness of advanced technologies make them very attractive, once theyare stable enough for implementation in the operational business environment.andM;For example, Martin Korsin, a consultant with LogicaData Architects, at NewYork Life Insurance, plans to reduce cable installation costs &quot;by as much as80 percent using unshielded twisted pair (UTP) to support IBM 16Mbps TokenRing.andP;  Substitution of UTP for IBM Type 1 cabling accounts for the costdifferential.&quot;andM;Advanced technologies include 16Mbps Token Ring, high-speed LANs overunshielded twisted-pair, direct LAN attachment of 37X5 controllers, 3174control units, and mid-range processors, high performance LAN adapters,database servers, the new generation of superservers, and advanced long-haulrouters.andP;  Soon, implementation of FDDI backbones will be ready for practicalconsideration.andM;Cost/Capabilities Analysis: My version of cost/benefit analysis is acost/capabilities analysis.andP;  The businessperson wants to know the underlyingstrategy, the cost, the major deliverables, how the major deliverablesquantitatively and qualitatively impact the business, the capacities andcapabilities implicit in the technology investment, the risks associated withpossible outcomes, and the level of probability associated with each futureoutcome.andP;  It is also valuable to project possible future scenarios againstwhich the plan's strategic validity may be evaluated.andP;  Business peopleappreciate the quantification of business impact over time, taking intoaccount the time value of money.andP;  Risk assessment is invaluable since risksabound in technology investment.andM;ImplementationandM;Upon the plan's completion and approval, we are ready to seize the reins ofaction.andP;  Implementation steps consist of resource procurement, installation,configuration, testing, onsite training, and operational cutover.andM;Hardware, software, and expert human resources are needed to proceed.andO;Procurement of hardware and software involves the formal ordering process andsecuring timely delivery.andP;  Given the red tape at many large companies, thiscan be a drawn-out endeavor.andP;  At other companies, the plan might have beengreeted with enthusiasm, but trauma sets in when it comes time to spend themoney.andP;  In any event, planners must build sufficient lead times into projectplans or find short cuts to ensure that implementation action is not held updue to lack of materials.andM;A task force of LAN experts can achieve an incredible amount ofimplementation progress in a relatively short time span.andP;  This group shouldbe assembled very early in the game.andP;  Once the cable plant is in place, asmall LAN can be implemented in as little time as one day; a large LAN takesat least a week or two.andP;  The implementation team may be composed of bothinhouse and outside personnel.andP;  Assemble experts and then give them thefreedom to fulfill the implementation objectives.andP;  Consultants who aretrustworthy, proven veterans should lead the charge.andP;  These same consultantsshould have participated in the planning process since its inception.andM;Cabling installation is for electricians, not for LAN experts.andP;  However, LANexperts can handle the cabling when needed.andP;  Little physical layerengineering is normally required at end-user companies because the physicallayer is pre-engineered to the vendor's specifications.andP;  After the cabling isinstalled, meters can be used to check for continuity, resistance, and otherpertinent electrical characteristics.andP;  Electrical grounds may have to beassessed for some network topologies.andM;Once the electricians have installed the cable plant and checked the readingswith their meters, I strongly advise a quality assurance review.andP;  The bestway to do the quality assurance review is to put wheels on a PC that alreadyhas an adapter board installed.andP;  Use a boot diskette to initialize networksoftware and then run a few quick network tests at the connection point foreach node.andP;  Generally, this exercise only takes a few minutes per connectionand will most likely uncover numerous problems.andP;  The new LAN users will bespared from a negative initial LAN experience.andM;Installing hardware for direct connection of devices to the LAN isstraightforward, although the configuration can be complex.andP;  Network adaptersmust be installed in all PCs along with an adapter cable that connects theadapter to the main cabling plant.andP;  TICs and the appropriate cabling would beinstalled in 37X5s and other SNA devices.andP;  For personal computers, thehardware installation is normally a routine PC maintenance job: Put thenetwork adapter board in a slot, attach the adapter cable, run diagnostics,then plug the adapter cable into the cable plant.andP;  Hardware-oriented fieldengineers normally provide the hardware installation services.andM;Every reputable software package has documentation that gives a cleardescription of installation procedures.andP;  The LAN software installationusually consists of the device driver installation and the network operatingsystem software installation.andP;  Device drivers residing in the CONFIG.SYS file(of OS/2 and DOS nodes) enable the higher-level LAN software to access theLAN adapter.andP;  Adapter device drivers sometimes come with the adapter or maybe part of a separate package.andM;The IBM LAN Support Program is an example of device drivers in a separatepackage; those device drivers provide data link control and NetBIOSinterfaces for IBM DOS-based LAN operating systems on Token Ring andEthernet.andP;  Normally, the device drivers are just copied onto the node andthen an installation aid program is run.andP;  The higher-level network operatingsystem software also normally installs through an installation aid programthat comes with the package.andP;  The exceptions are the NetWare shell files forDOS-based workstations; they are usually just copied onto the workstation.andO;Many installation aid programs automatically update the CONFIG.SYS andAUTOEXEC.BAT files of the LAN node that they are run on.andP;  (Automatic updatesmay or may not be helpful.)andM;Existing workstation and/or menuing systems may need to be changed in orderto take advantage of the LAN functionality.andP;  Therefore, new workstationsoftware might be part of the installation task list.andP;  A workstation ormenuing system should be used, since LAN features such as virtual drivesconfuse the user at the operating system prompt.andM;Installation of bridge software is not extremely difficult, but the procedurevaries by vendor.andP;  For example, an IBM Token Ring bridge attaches to andconnects two rings.andP;  A NetWare 286 server with internal bridging, which canhave up to four different LAN adapters installed, also routes traffic amongthe dissimilar LANs.andM;Gateways between LANs and external communication systems must have multipleconnections, which means multiple communication adapters.andP;  Device drivers andcommunication software need to be installed on the gateway node.andP;  Again, theinstallation procedure depends on the gateway type and vendor.andP;  Although theLAN side is relatively straightforward, consult a WAN expert for the externalservices side.andP;  Routers are similar to bridges and gateways from theinstallation perspective, but are more powerful and complex.andP;  They canpotentially support many different kinds of LAN-to-LAN and LAN-to-WANconnections.andM;On enterprisewide LANs, specialized nodes can be installed to performfunctions such as network management, monitoring, capacity utilization, andproblem diagnosis.andM;After the cable plant is installed, little or no configuration work isrequired.andP;  However, adapter configuration settings might require adjustmentfor a variety of reasons, including performance optimization, resolvingconflicts with other adapters, and avoiding memory conflicts with EMS devicedrivers.andM;Adapter configuration settings may include any of the following: the range ofPC memory addresses and amount of PC memory used by the adapter, hardwareinterrupt level, primary or secondary adapter designation, data rate, baseI/O address, direct memory addressing, and connector type.andP;  Settings for aparticular adapter vary by type.andM;Some network device drivers, like those of the IBM LAN Support Program, canbe used to set the range of PC memory addresses used by the adapter toestablish a locally administered network address for the node, and toconfigure on-board adapter RAM.andP;  For Token Ring, data link transmit andreceive buffers, messaging buffers, timing parameters, and resources forsupporting multiple node-to-node communication links are the most importantfactors.andP;  Network performance and functionality are impacted by the parametersettings used to configure the adapter.andM;Configuring network operating system software can be very elaborate forIBM/Microsoft LAN operating systems.andP;  For DOS workstations, lots of NET STARTparameters and heuristics can be set to tailor performance, expandfunctionality, or reduce the amount of PC memory used by the LAN software.andO;The latest software versions store the parameters in a DOSLAN.INI orLANMAN.INI file.andP;  Parameter settings at this higher level must beorchestrated with the parameters coded after the NetBIOS device driver.andO;Tuning the NetBIOS parameters is both an art and a science that few havemastered.andM;OS/2 workstations and servers running IBM/Microsoft LAN software are two orthree times more complex to configure than their DOS predecessors.andP;  The IBMOS/2 LAN Requester and LAN Server parameters are stored in an IBMLAN.INIfile.andP;  In addition, they require the Communications (Comms) Manager to beconfigured, since all the interfaces that support the LAN Requester and LANServer are contained in the Comms Manager.andP;  In terms of complexity, the CommsManager configuration is equal to or greater than that of the IBMLAN.INIfile.andM;IBM workstation and server software can be installed and then configuredafterward, although some basic configuring is required at installation time.andO;The opposite sequence pertains to NetWare server software.andP;  It must beconfigured before installation; only the maintenance may be done later.andP;  Theconfiguration is part of the network generation process.andP;  Likewise, NetWareworkstation shell files for DOS nodes are configured during the shellgeneration and installed later.andP;  The NetWare Requester for OS/2 installs morelike the IBM OS/2 LAN Requester than its NetWare brethren; however, it isquite a bit simpler to configure than the IBM OS/2 LAN Requester.andM;Workstation systems, menuing systems, and environment software, likeMicrosoft Windows, impact and are impacted by the LAN software configuration.andO;Other LAN and non-LAN communication software are additional variablespertinent to configuration.andP;  RAM requirements and memory addresses might haveto be juggled to avoid conflicts and ensure that sufficient RAM is free torun all workstation applications.andP;  Adapter resources over and above thoserequired by the LAN operating system might have to be allocated for othercommunication software that concurrently uses the LAN adapter.andM;Throughout the LAN configuration process, the nodes must be thoroughly testedfirst by the task force persons doing the configuration work, and next by theLAN administrator and users.andP;  Every possible workstation option should bechecked.andM;The initial network administration is part of the configuration process.andO;Users must be setup, shared LAN resources (file sets, printers, communicationdevices, etc.) must be defined, access rights to the shared resources must becreated, and shared application systems must be installed on the file server.andO;Onsite LAN orientation and training should be given to the LAN users as wellas to the LAN administrator.andP;  The LAN administrator hopefully witnessed andparticipated in the hands-on implementation process; much of that experienceserves as a training exercise.andM;Documentation of the LAN configuration must be prepared and walked throughfor accuracy.andP;  It is normally very detailed for the cable plant ofenterprisewide LANs.andP;  Important procedures covered in the documentation forthe LAN administrator include implementing a new LAN workstation, backup andrestoration of workstations and file servers using LAN-based backup devices,problem solving and trouble shooting procedures, and a contingency plan inthe event of LAN failure from a variety of causes.andM;Once the user group is satisfied that the LAN works, the implementation taskforce turns the LAN over to the LAN administrator.andP;  From this point forward,the LAN administrator relies on the LAN support group whenever help isneeded.andM;SupportandM;All implemented LAN resources must be supported.andP;  Broadly speaking, the LANsupport organization's mission is twofold: problem solving/troubleshootingand training.andM;Hardware and software is normally serviced through different groups withinLAN support.andP;  Hardware support covers the cable plant, network adapters, andphysical maintenance of PCs, 3174 control units, 37X5 communicationcontrollers, and other devices that are directly LAN-attached.andP;  Routinenon-cable plant hardware support should be a subcomponent of the centralhardware maintenance group, because the same skills apply to both LAN andnon-LAN hardware.andP;  Eventually, almost all hardware within the organizationwill somehow be related to LANs.andM;The bread and butter of LAN support is software, operating systems, andworkstations.andP;  More than 80 percent of LAN support calls pertain to one ormore of these.andP;  Application system concerns sometimes come into play.andO;Special configuration considerations pertain to applications running on LANs.andO;LAN experts can perform astounding &quot;tricks&quot; with single and multiuserapplications on LANs.andP;  Also, application developers who are writing LANapplications periodically need advice from the LAN experts on performanceoptimization, multiuser LAN programming techniques, and programminginterfaces.andM;LAN support can be performed over the telephone, via e-mail, through remoteLAN management tools, or onsite.andP;  Remote access software helps with supportfrom a distance by allowing central support personnel to view and manipulatenodes on remote LANs or on LANs elsewhere in the building.andP;  However, LANsupport personnel must appear onsite when the problem cannot be resolved byadvising the LAN administrator or by using the network management anddiagnostic tools.andP;  While the LAN administrator is usually the point ofcontact for the LAN support group, high priority users sometimes get specialattention.andM;Enterprisewide LAN support sometimes involves multiple network disciplines;global network support frequently involves multiple network disciplines.andO;Multiple network disciplines mean trouble because people in differenttechnical components of the organization must work together.andP;  And thedifferent mindsets sometimes seem incompatible.andP;  Eccentricity in technicalexperts is not unusual.andP;  This is a key management issue.andP;  It is best tostructure the support organization in a manner that minimizesinterdisciplinary conflicts.andP;  Otherwise, problem resolution is hampered, andsooner or later systems management is embarrassed in front of the businessoperating units.andM;The LAN support group must always be prepared for contingency action, sinceit is the support group of last resort.andM;TrainingandM;LAN training requirements are much more extensive than most people realize.andO;They are also ongoing.andP;  LAN training is vital to the efficient and successfuldissemination of LAN technology throughout the company.andP;  Much of the trainingshould be done on a formal hands-on basis in a training facility equippedwith a full set of communication technology.andP;  The trainers can be drawn fromoutside LAN experts, and/or the inhouse LAN implementation task force and LANsupport group.andP;  For a large company, an offering of training courses byaudience might look like the following.andM;Upper management: One day seminars for upper management include: BusinessPlanning for LAN Technology, Strategic Deployment of enterprisewide LANConnectivity, Why LANs?andP;  Economic and Qualitative Advantages of LAN-basedSystems, Solutions for Integration of Heterogeneous System Environments,Alternatives in LAN Technology, and Organizing Technical Resources forEffective LAN Implementation and Support.andP;  Since top managers are thedecision makers and later are the &quot;nurturers&quot; of the LAN-based strategy, manyof the seminars should be attended before the planning process begins.andO;Afterward, a one-day hands-on lab can be tailored to the interests of selectmembers of the upper management group.andM;Middle management: One day seminars are best for middle managers, such as:Departmental LANs--Management and Functionality, Managing the LANAdministrator, and Alternatives in LAN Technology.andM;LAN administrators: At least two courses are needed: Basic LAN Administrationand Advanced LAN Administration.andP;  The former is a three-day course; thelatter is a five-day course.andP;  The courses, which split time evenly betweenlectures and laboratory workshops, are geared toward the type of hardware,LAN software, operating systems, and workstations implemented on the LANs forwhich the LAN administrators are responsible.andM;Users: Two levels are needed.andP;  The Introduction to LANs lecture lasts for ahalf day.andP;  Advanced Issues in LANs is a two-day course, with time dividedequally between classroom and hands-on lab.andM;LAN implementation/support personnel: Basic LAN Implementation and Supportand Advanced LAN Implementation and Support are both one-week coursesemphasizing lab work.andP;  Lectures are given in the lab.andM;Workstation development personnel: The LAN Technology Considerations inWorkstation Design course enables workstation development personnel to feelcomfortable with LAN technology and understand how to incorporate LANtechnology into their workstation products.andP;  It is a three-day course thatemphasizes lab work.andM;Application development personnel: LAN Application Systems Development andDesign enables application developers to learn LAN programming interfaces,become comfortable with LAN technology, and understand the subtleties of LANapplication design.andP;  This course mainly consists of three days of lab work.andM;Physical layer specialist personnel: Personnel who implement and maintain theenterprisewide cable plant and network adapters often get locked into anarrow &quot;physical&quot; view of LANs.andP;  A broader perspective helps them in testingand diagnosing physical layer problems, using tools that run in the higherlayers, as well as vendor problem determination procedures.andP;  Three days oflectures and labs will do the job for this group, although they will probablywant more.andM;OrganizationandM;The organization's structure should consciously encourage teamwork throughoutthe company by maximizing internal efficiencies and minimizing internal andexternal political wastefulness.andP;  It should also honestly involve thebusiness operating units in all major technology decisions, and maintaingenuine sensitivity to the viewpoints of non-networking system groups whomight need to incorporate network functionality into their deliverables.andM;Higher level management must root out excessive politics that impair therealization of satisfactory efficiency.andP;  Interdepartmental cooperation isimperative.andP;  Otherwise, the systems organization will be viewed verynegatively from the vantage point of the business operating units--the kissof death for MIS.andM;Strong management does not mean a top-down approach that dominates and alwayssets direction.andP;  With fast paced technologies, the top-down approach can becounterproductive and wasteful.andP;  Control must be relinquished where abottom-up approach makes more sense, as is generally the case with LANs.andO;Upper management then assumes the role of nurturers and benefactors.andP;  Controlcan be satisfactorily maintained through their trusted agents.andP;  It does nottake long for upper management to see the beneficial results of LANinnovation when the game plan is sound and the implementation runs smoothly.andM;Today there is a general crisis in technical management at Americanbusinesses.andP;  Being people- or business-oriented is not enough; systemsmanagement must understand and must be able to finesse the technologyanalogous to the way accounting managers understand and can finesse thenumbers in financial analysis.andP;  Good technical leadership has its roots intechnical managers who understand the technology and what is going on aroundthem.andP;  Keeping up with technological change is not easy; it requirestechnical renewal training, involvement, teamwork, person-to-personcommunication, and most important, using the technology everyday at theoffice to do one's job.andM;Good management brings out the best in people.andP;  A good manager is a catalystfor teamwork and achievement through which the department as a whole becomessignificantly greater than the sum of its individual human elements.andP;  People,however, are more important than the organization.andP;  An organization is alogical combination of human resources; it is not a higher form of life.andM;According to Wall Street legend, J.
