Particularemphasis is given to operation and maintenance of vehicle fleets. In-plantconservation measures include proper maintenance and operation of lifttrucks, off-peak charging of lift truck batteries, and proper sealingof loading doors to reduce heat losses. Savings in the use of companycars are possible through purchasing fuel efficient vehicles and ensuringtheir efficient use. The greatest potential for energy savings involvesthe use of trucks. Routing and load optimization are prime considerations;this includes eliminating unnecessary trips, maximizing payloads, andproper sizing of the truck for the job. Driver training will help toimplement optimum operating procedures such as reduction of idling time,tuning the engine, operating at optimum rpm, and gearing down when necessary.Use of radial tires offers great potential for energy conservation interms of fuel consumption, tire wear and reduced downtime. Diesel engines,in spite of higher initial cost, offer many advantages to gasoline engines,including lower fuel and maintenance cost, and greater reliability. Aerodynamicdrag reduction devices, double trailers, automatic transmissions, demand-actuatedfan clutches, and modified engines and drive trains are some of the technicalimprovements effective in a number of cases. New trends discussed inthis booklet include alternative power sources, improved engines, andsynthetic lubricants. A number of case studies are presented showingenergy and cost savings in various industrial applications. 4 figs.,8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
