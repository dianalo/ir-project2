More than $1.1 billion would be cut from President Bush'sbudget for grants to finance military sales. And the measureimposes new limits lowering U.S. military aid to Greece andTurkey to 20% under current appropriations levels.</LP><TEXT>   Assistance for Eastern Europe would grow to about $500million, or almost $200 million above the Bushadministration's request, and the Democratic-controlled panelapproved $800 million for sub-Saharan Africa, a 40% increaseabove current funding.   The Africa funding was combined with new restrictionspractically denying any direct funding to Zaire's Mobuturegime. Elsewhere, the bill would significantly tighten aprior congressional ban on the use of Export-Import Bankfinancing for trade with Iraq.   Within Central America, 50% of new military aid to ElSalvador would be withheld in an effort to promote a peacesettlement. And the bill requires that the U.S. withhold itssupport for the World Bank in proportion to any bank loansissued to China for non-basic human needs.   Adopted on a party line 8-4 vote, the measure is sure toface opposition from the administration. But committeeRepublicans openly conceded their own frustration in craftingan alternative package with the White House and StateDepartment. &quot;There ain't nobody home,&quot; said Rep. MickeyEdwards (R., Okla.). And more than any bill yet this year,the drafting process reflected the tugs and pulls asWashington attempts to adjust to a changing world.   The fine print runs from $150,000 for a labor-statisticsprogram for the Soviets and Czechoslovakians to a Universityof Chicago feasibility study to revive ancient irrigationmethods in the high plateaus of Bolivia. The African aidreflects a major initiative by the House Black Caucus tobecome more of a player in shaping foreign aid, while ethnic,Midwest politics are a factor behind a provision urging theWest to forgive past loans to Poland.   The fight over military aid is a harbinger of what is tocome on the defense budget, and U.S. arms contractors areincreasingly looking to foreign sales as military spending isreduced at home. The administration had sought to increaseaid to more than $5 billion, and most of this assistancewould come in the form of direct grants. By comparison, theproposed House bill would bring down U.S. aid to under $4.5billion and distribute this under a less generous formulathat includes loans as well as grants.   The foreign operations measure is the fourth of the majorfiscal 1991 spending bills to be drafted in the past week.While no agreement has yet been reached on a final budgetresolution, the legislation set in motion in the Housealready covers at least six executive departments as well asspace and environmental agencies.   Bills for the Energy, State, Justice, and CommerceDepartments cleared the House Appropriations Committeeyesterday, and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said hehoped that agreement could be reached on a provisionalresolution in the Senate to allow action there as well.   As this pressure has built, there is continued concern inthe administration that the new spending ceilings set in thevaried appropriations bills will weaken the White House'sposition in budget talks with Congress. Allocations approvedby the full House committee yesterday shift billions ofdollars from military accounts to housing and domesticinitiatives.   And while Republican lawmakers complained, they also havebeen among the most active in securing funds for everythingfrom home-state universities in Massachusetts and Michigan towater projects in rural Kentucky.   &quot;Today is the high water mark. . . . reality will soon setin,&quot; said Massachusetts Rep. Silvio Conte, the rankingRepublican on the House Appropriations panel. &quot;Enjoy.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
