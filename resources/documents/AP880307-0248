Hundreds of writers grabbed ``The Writers Guild Strikes''placards depicting a quill and lightning bolt as mid-morning picketlines snaked in front of Twentieth Century Fox studios.   The Writers Guild of America rejected a final offer presentedSunday by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producersand called a walkout for 9,000 of its 9,600 members. The 600 WGAnews writers are exempt from this action.   The strike began here and in New York City at 9 a.m. PST today.The contract expired at midnight Feb. 29.   Marty Waldman, a WGA spokesman in New York, said there would beno picketing in the East today.   ``The longer the strike goes on, the more reruns the public willsee,'' said Brian Walton, WGA West executive director and chiefnegotiator. ``It's a very tight ratings race and unfortunately forthe networks it will impact them.''   Picket captain Stanley Ralph Ross said selection of Fox's WestLos Angeles studio ``was fairly arbitrary,'' adding its size andlocation had a lot to do with it.   ``We usually pick a major studio, and there's parking aroundhere,'' Ross said.   ``Grandview U.S.A.'' writer Ken Hixon, who marched with his2-year old son, Sam, said writers were much more unified for thisstrike than in their last walkout in 1985.   ``There was nearly a civil war last time between screen writersand television writers. But this time there's real solidarity,''Hixon said.   ``Viewers will begin seeing the effects on those programsrelying on scripts on a daily basis. Talk shows, game shows and thesoaps will see a difference right away,'' said guild spokeswomanCheryl Rhoden.   The strike slows down the production process and if prolonged,``it finally comes to a halt,'' she said. A three-month strikedelayed the fall television season three years ago.   Walton said the network that would be hardest hit would befirst-place NBC, whose ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,''``Saturday Night Live'' and ``Late Night With David Letterman,''would be affected immediately.   Edward Adler, president of WGA East, said nine soap operas onthe East Coast and five in California also would be affectedimmediately, as would prime time miniseries, television movies andfeatures in development or in production.   But Herb Steinberg, a spokesman for the alliance, whichrepresents 200 producers and studios, said a strike was anticipatedand scripts have been stockpiled.   ``Shows like Carson's show will go into reruns. But we willcontinue business,'' he said.   Producers had sought to scale back residual payments for someone-hour shows syndicated in the United States and said theycouldn't pay writers more for reruns in foreign markets.   The median annual income for writers is $40,000 a year, butabout half of the guild's members are unemployed at any given time,said Rhoden. The writers sought the first change in 17 years in howthey are compensated when programs are aired in foreign markets.They now receive a single lump sum that varies depending on what isnegotiated between the writer and producer.   The writers also demanded more artistic control on the finalproduct.   ``We had all kinds of creative guarantees in there short ofgiving them total control,'' Steinberg said. ``The director is thecaptain of that creative team. We couldn't bargain away rights thatbelonged to other guilds and unions.''   The producers had offered a $50 million package over athree-year period, including improvements in pension and healthplans, Steinberg said.   In union ballots last week in Los Angeles and New York, 96percent approved a walkout if no agreement was reached.   The last script writers strike was in 1985 and lasted two weeks.Since the WGA won its first contract in 1947, script writersconducted strikes five times, more than any other entertainmentindustry union.   Separately, the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation ofTelevision and Radio Artists bargained through the weekend withmakers of TV and radio commercials over daily pay rates and rerunpayments for 100,000 actors.   Members of those unions approved a strike by a 93 percent marginin recent votes, said SAG spokesman Mark Locher.</TEXT></DOC>
