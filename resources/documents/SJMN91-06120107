Or is the governmentsuppressing free speech at universities, the very place where all ideas shouldbe debated fully and fearlessly?;    All ideas. Even ideas about drugs.;    Nolecturer was asked about the draft, and the government doesn't telluniversities to punish draft resistance by students and staff.;    But StuartT. Reges, 32, a computer science lecturer at Stanford, was asked by a studentfor advice about trying an illicit drug called MDA, which produces euphoria.;   &quot;He had already tried marijuana and LSD, and he had positive experienceswith those drugs, so I naturally reassured him that he had nothing to worryabout and should go ahead and experiment with MDA,&quot; Reges wrote in a Nov. 28letter to the office of drug prevention programs in higher education.;   Reges has been suspended from teaching his popular computer science classes,and is under investigation on suspicion of violating the university's new drugand alcohol policy, which is indeed required by the government.;    InStanford Daily articles published Nov. 8 and 9, Reges made his violation ofthe policy, and his advocacy, clear. &quot;My advice regarding the new alcohol anddrug policy is to defy it and to do so as openly as you are willing to do,&quot; hewrote Nov. 9. &quot;As for myself, I have done illegal drugs in the past and I willcontinue to do so. I have never taught class or held office hours while underthe influence of drugs or alcohol, but I have kept illegal drugs in mybackpack while on campus, and I will do so in the future.&quot;;    Students calledto invite him to discuss his views at dorm dinners, for many the first timethey'd heard narcotically incorrect speech. A university drug counselor calledto argue with him. The administration did not seek to enforce its -- or thegovernment's -- drug policy.;    So Reges wrote three times to federal drugofficials, explaining what he was doing and why. On April 12, the new drugczar Bob Martinez wrote to Stanford President Donald Kennedy, complaining thatReges &quot;carries illegal drugs on the Stanford campus, uses them himself andadvocates and encourages their use by Stanford undergraduates,&quot; and that &quot;Mr.Reges further informs us that his 'pro-drug stance' and illegal drug use arebroadly known on the Stanford campus,&quot; but no disciplinary action has beentaken against him.&quot;;    To receive federal funds, universities must &quot;adopt andimplement a drug prevention program for students and employees . . . thatclearly prohibit unlawful possession, use or distribution of illicit drugs bystudents and employees on an institution's property,&quot; Martinez observed.;   Kennedy, already trying to protect Stanford's federal research funds, putReges on leave, with pay, pending an investigation.;    There may be a legaldistinction between saying &quot;I think MDA is a safe, enjoyable drug,&quot; andsaying, &quot;I advise you to try MDA.&quot; Still, it's clear Reges is operatingsquarely in the tradition of civil disobedience, and that the government isnot trying to enforce its laws, giving him a day in court, but ratherpressuring the university to fire him as a drug-war security risk.;    It'salso clear Reges is opening a philosophical and political debate, somethingrarely defined as professional misconduct.;    Reges argues that certain drugscan provide &quot;intellectual and spiritual lessons,&quot; as well as harmlesspleasure, that university students are old enough to decide whether to trydrugs, and that the government has no right to criminalize individuals'decisions to protect them from harm.;    In his Daily columns, he explains whyhe obeys laws such as the 55 mph speed limit -- it's legitimate because itregulates conduct that affects others -- and rejects laws that regulateprivate adult behavior, such as drug use and sodomy.;    How can he speakhonestly about his political views without admitting that he practices what hepreaches? How can he debate the premise that all illicit drugs are bad, if hecan't cite his illuminating drug experiences? The university can punishadvocacy of civil disobedience and risk-taking behavior, and require narcoticcorrectness, but should it?;    In his Nov. 9 column, Reges writes, &quot;while Ido not recognize the government's authority to limit drug and alcohol use ofcitizens 18 or over, I do think that Stanford as a private institution has theright to expel students or fire staff for such behavior. I would try toconvince members of the institution to behave otherwise, but I don't think Ihave an inviolable 'right' to my job at Stanford.&quot;;    He adds, &quot;I do notthink it can succeed as an institution of higher learning if it does notencourage its students, faculty and staff to take responsibility for their ownchoices and if it does not afford each of them some sphere of privacy in whichto function.&quot;;    Good point.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Joanne Jacobs column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910429  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  948  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday April 29, 199100120107,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
