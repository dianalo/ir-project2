Germanofficials couldn't be reached for comment Thursday night.   The Soviets, with exports off and ties between the centralgovernment and the republics uncertain, may not have enoughhard currency to meet their debt obligations for the nextthree months. Although estimates vary widely and G-7officials are waiting for more data from the Soviets, onefrequently cited estimate puts the shortfall at about $5billion.   &quot;There is a hump that they need to get over, and then itwill be easier for them to service their debt,&quot; the seniorU.S. official said.   Officials have been reluctant to speculate on the formthat such aid might take, but the possibilities clearlyinclude a short-term &quot;bridge loan&quot; or a mutually negotiateddeferral of certain debt obligations or both.   The finance ministers and central bank governors of theG-7 nations begin their sessions here Friday. They plan tomeet with a Soviet delegation, tentatively Saturday.   The Germans have more at stake than some other G-7nations, and not only because they are geographically closerto the Soviets. The Institute of International Finance, abank group, estimates that the Soviets owe $60 billion, morethan a third of it to Germany. Much of that debt isguaranteed by the German government, and any decision todefer payments or even to formally recognize the Soviets'liquidity crisis could prove troublesome for Germanpoliticians and could increase that country's already growingbudget deficit.   U.S. officials continue to emphasize that the Bangkokmeeting is unlikely to produce a fully fleshed-out plan foreasing the Soviet liquidity crisis. &quot;I wouldn't look at thisparticular meeting as a watershed, but as an ongoing,continuous, intensive exploration of the economic evolutionof the Soviet Union and the types of problems that areemerging,&quot; Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan toldreporters accompanying him and Treasury Secretary NicholasBrady to Bangkok.   A major obstacle is the uncertain ties between the centralSoviet government and the republics. &quot;The most importantthing that they could bring would be clarity in theresponsibilities of the center and the republics, startingwith debt obligations,&quot; the senior U.S. official said.Indeed, the Soviet Union may have sufficient foreign exchangeto pay its bills, but the hard currency may not be getting tothe central government.   At a news conference in Tokyo, where he stopped beforeheading for Bangkok, Mr. Brady said there is currently &quot;acritical discussion&quot; going on about the relationship betweenthe center and the republics. He said it's important toresolve that question, but it's not surprising that theresolution is proving difficult. &quot;Centuries of history arebeing undone,&quot; Mr. Brady said.   Although negotiating with one strong central governmentwould be simpler, Mr. Brady told reporters on his plane:&quot;We're going to have to play the hand we've been dealt.&quot;   The Treasury secretary resisted suggestions from Europeansthat the U.S. hasn't committed enough humanitarian aid to theSoviets. &quot;The U.S. is there with $2.5 billion in foodcredits,&quot; he said. &quot;It's hard money, and it's going rightthis minute.&quot; The Japanese and the Western Europeans havecommitted what they say are similar size credits, althoughthere is some dispute about the actual value of the Japanesepackage.   U.S. officials also reiterated that currency values aren'ta big issue at this meeting of the G-7 nations. &quot;I don't seeit as a paramount issue,&quot; said a senior U.S. official. &quot;Idon't expect the communique to have strong language oncurrencies.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
