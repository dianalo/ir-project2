It will start by showing the world the financialequivalent of the Grand Canyon.   GM is expected to report today a loss of nearly $6 billionfor 1991, including a nearly $3 billion charge for its thirdmassive retrenchment since 1986. For the first time since theGreat Depression, the leaders of America's largest industrialcorporation are running scared.</LP><TEXT>   Consider this from Robert T. O'Connell, GM's chieffinancial officer: &quot;No company, not even one as large as GM,can sustain the magnitude of loss we had in the fourthquarter on an ongoing basis.&quot; Mr. O'Connell spoke those wordsnot last week or last month -- but a year ago, in an addressto employees after GM lost $1.6 billion in the 1990 fourthquarter. It's been four quarters of red ink since.   The losses led to Chairman Robert C. Stempel's Dec. 18bombshell news that GM will shut 21 more North Americanfactories and shed 74,000 workers by 1995. The Big Question:Is this just another step in a long, agonizing retreat, orcan GM finally turn itself around?   The answer is, nobody really knows. But this week Mr.Stempel is supposed to lay out the details of how GM will getsmaller and also suggest how it intends to get better.Specifically:   He's likely to name some of the doomed plants. By week'send, GM workers in Arlington, Texas and Ypsilanti, Mich., mayknow which of those plants will continue to build GM's large,rear-drive cars. The loser could close, or take a productfrom another factory that will then shut down.   He's expected to begin consolidating GM's North Americanautomotive bureaucracy to slice out redundant planning,purchasing and financial staffs. Ultimately, GM's three bigvehicle-making groups, created by the company's 1984reorganization, could be merged.   GM already is launching a push to cut 10% of its 92,000domestic salaried jobs by June 1. Salaried workers as youngas 51 years old are being offered full pensions to retire.Some are balking, concerned that GM may cut its generousretiree health benefits. But GM managers are sending a toughmessage: Those who don't retire risk getting fired.   It isn't clear how much of his long-range shrinking planMr. Stempel will reveal this week. The GM chairman is leeryof rattling his troops too hard. But Mr. Stempel is underenormous pressure to speed up his attack on GM's burdensomecost structure.   GM's non-employee directors are signaling deep dismay.They even held a meeting without Mr. Stempel in Detroit lastmonth, despite Mr. Stempel's request that the meeting nottake place.   Mr. Stempel now has issued tough marching orders: GM willdo whatever it takes to break-even overall this year, even ifthe U.S. economy manages only a modest recovery. In effect,company officials say, Mr. Stempel and President Lloyd E.Reuss, the man in charge of GM's core domestic vehiclebusiness, have their credibility -- and perhaps their careers-- on the line.   GM faces considerable obstacles to its streamliningefforts. It's easy to denounce waste and duplicated effort.It's hard to stop it. GM, for instance, has two vicepresidents directly involved in corporate marketing efforts.In addition, senior executives still get involved in managingadvertising details. Mr. Stempel ordered a costly,last-minute redo of a major commercial aired during the SuperBowl. The chairman objected to the tag line, &quot;A New Time. ANew GM.&quot; (The line appeared in subsequent print ads.)   Consolidating GM's three vehicle-making groups makesperfect sense, many GM executives say. But first, thecomputer systems at each group will have to be overhauled sothey can talk to each other. That process, begun five yearsago, is still under way.   Then there's the United Auto Workers union. Mr. Stempelwants the union to reopen its rich 1990 contract andnegotiate cost-saving measures. The UAW's response has gonefrom diffident to downright hostile. Last week, UAW vicepresident Stephen P. Yokich told workers to rejectmanagement's request that they take vacations during acompanywide shutdown this July. GM says it could save as muchas $200 million if hourly workers took vacations during theshutdown instead of unemployment pay.   Then Friday, Mr. Yokich blasted the International Union ofElectronics Workers for agreeing to concessions on workrules, and cuts in wages and benefits for future hires, in abid to save 3,100 IUE jobs at a truck factory in Moraine,Ohio. IUE Secretary-Treasurer Ed Fire said GM officialswarned the factory could close, and IUE workers in Moraine&quot;said this is what they should do to save their jobs.&quot; Butthe UAW's Mr. Yokich said he is &quot;appalled&quot; by the IUE's move.The UAW, he said, won't &quot;get into a panicked bidding war withthe IUE or anyone else to lower work standards, or pay andbenefits.&quot;   GM is getting more cost-cutting help from its suppliers,but only a little. GM asked suppliers to roll back theirprices by 3% this year, in return for a promise that GMengineers would work with suppliers to cut the costs ofcomponents through better designs. So far, suppliers haveanted up about $1 billion in ideas, says GM vice presidentDonald Pais. But Mr. Pais says GM actually has realized just$150 million in savings so far.   GM executives have some reasons for optimism. Since lastJune, investors have snapped up nearly $4 billion in new GMpreferred stock and other securities. That's likely toforestall costly downgrades of the top-tier ratings on some$20 billion of GM commercial paper. Car sales are perking upslightly. And some of GM's new luxury cars are selling andreceiving positive reviews.   More of GM's factories are instituting efficient, &quot;lean&quot;production methods. At GM's Lansing, Mich. assembly plant,managers use wall charts to analyze each task on the assemblyline and determine how to cut wasted steps and movement outof a job. This idea comes from GM's joint venture withJapan's Toyota Motor Corp.   But these improvements are coming slowly. It took GM andthe UAW five years to agree on a cooperative strategy forspreading the lean production gospel more rapidly. Early thismonth, the joint UAWGM Quality Network organization finallybegan grading how far along each of GM's U.S. plants are inadopting cooperative, lean production programs. &quot;There arepockets of excellence around the corporation,&quot; says ThomasWeekley, the UAW's full-time Quality Network representative.   But pockets of excellence aren't enough for a company withan operating loss of $5.2 billion in the year ended Sept. 30,1991. It's like giving away &quot;more than $1,000 in the trunk ofevery car we sell,&quot; says a GM vice president. &quot;Something'sgot to change.&quot;   Until it does, Mr. Stempel is playing any card he can.Last month, he abandoned GM's traditional free-trade stanceand joined Ford Motor Chairman Harold A. Poling and ChryslerCorp. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca in asking Japanese auto makersto slow their advances in the U.S.   The result: Toyota this month announced plans to raiseprices on U.S. models. And Japan's government is expected toorder cuts in vehicle shipments to the U.S. within a fewweeks.   GM is acting quickly to take advantage of these moves byreducing rebates on several high-volume models and raisingprices on its money-losing Saturn line of importfightersubcompacts.   Price hikes will provide a short-term boost for GM. But GMhas fundamental competitive shortcomings that will take yearsto overcome. For example, none of GM's midsized family cars,such as the Pontiac Grand Prix or Chevrolet Lumina, has anairbag. Virtually every other major competitor in thisbread-and-butter market segment does. But because of its cashcrunch, GM has delayed redesigning its midsized models untilthe mid-1990s.   Against this backdrop, Mr. Stempel is reluctant to promisequick results from his shrinking and streamlining efforts. Ashe said during a speech at the Chicago Auto Show earlier thismonth: &quot;We're taking an approach for the long term to get GMlean and viable.&quot;   ---                    The Fundamentals                                                                                                                                            1991*       1990                                                                                                          Sales ($ millions)               $89,451.6   $94,829.4   Net Income (Loss) ($ millions)   (2,217.7)     (368.7)   Earnings (Loss) Per Share           (4.10)      (1.20)                                                                                                          GM has set closing of eight assembly plants since 1988.The auto maker says it will close another six by themid-1990s.
