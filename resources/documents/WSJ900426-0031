As a result, the Treasury's $10.5 billion sale of two-yearnotes went poorly, causing bond prices to slide. The averageyield on the notes was 8.90%, up from 8.59% at the previoustwo-year note auction on March 27 and the highest averageyield at an auction since 9.34% on April 26, 1989.</LP><TEXT>   The yield attracted near-record participation byindividual investors, who tend to buy at auctions throughso-called &quot;non-competitive&quot; bids. These buyers agree toaccept securities at the average yield. At yesterday'sauction, non-competitive bids totaled $1.91 billion, a littlebelow the $1.99 billion record non-competitive bids receivedat the January 1989 auction.   But institutional investors shied away from the auctionfor fear that interest rates in the U.S. and abroad areheading higher and that U.S. bonds will continue to erode.   &quot;The fact that there was no follow-through buying {afterthe auction} has market participants a little nervous,&quot; saidJames Capra, senior vice president at Shearson LehmanGovernment Securities Inc. &quot;Some people are saying `if thereis a problem with the two-year auction, heaven forbid whatcould happen next month,'&quot; when the Treasury is scheduled tosell $30 billion of notes and bonds in the quarterlyrefunding of the federal debt.   Details of the refunding will be announced May 2, butanalysts expect the refunding package to resemble theprevious auction in February when the government sold $10billion each of three-year, 10-year and 30-year securities.   Shortly after yesterday's auction results were released,dealers began marking down prices. Late in the day, the yieldon the new two-year notes was quoted in when-issued tradingactivity at 8.94%, well above the auction average of 8.90%.The fact that the yield moved higher after the auction iswidely viewed as an indication that dealers had troubleselling the notes and were forced to cut prices, which raisesthe yield, to attract buyers.   Moreover, traders said some speculators purchased two-yearnotes early in the day on expectations that prices wouldtrade higher once the auction results were released. But whenthe opposite occurred, they unloaded those securities, whichexerted downward pressure on prices.   The benchmark Treasury bond also tumbled, but made apartial comeback just before the market closed. The 30-yearbond ended 1/8 point lower, a loss of $1.25 for a bond with a$1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in theopposite direction of its price, rose slightly to 8.97%.   Dealers said investors worried that upcoming economicreports, especially tomorrow's first-quarter gross nationalnumbers, will show sufficient strength and prompt the FederalReserve to tighten credit policy within the next month.   &quot;The fear of the GNP number on Friday and the implicationit might have for the Fed kept some institutional investorsaway from the auction,&quot; said David Green, manager of thegovernment bond trading department at Chemical Bank.                                                                                                          Junk, Corporate Bonds                                                                                                          The junk bonds of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. sprintedhigher on news that part of the giant publisher might besold.   Eugene J. McCarthy, an HBJ outside director, told DowJones Professional Investor Report that Harcourt and ThomsonCorp. of Canada have held discussions regarding the sale ofpart of the firm. Mr. McCarthy declined to elaborate.   HBJ's 13 3/4% senior subordinated debentures finished 21/4 points higher at 79 1/2 after initially rising fourpoints on the news. The 13% senior notes also gained, ending2 1/4 points higher at 94 1/2.   Anne Lorsung, a high-yield analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti andamp;Maffei Inc., said prices rose on the perception that ifThomson acquires part of Harcourt Brace, it will retire someof the debt at a premium.   &quot;The initial reaction is that a well-capitalized companytakes over a poorly-capitalized company and that could meanthe well-capitalized company will end up guaranteeing thedebt or paying it off at par or some premium,&quot; said Ms.Lorsung. Although she said this would be the &quot;best-casescenario,&quot; even in the &quot;worst-case scenario,&quot; where Thomsonwould launch an exchange offer for the bonds, holder of debtare likely to fare well.   Also higher were junk bonds of Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co.which continued to advance on Tuesday's news that the U.S.will allow Michelin Group to proceed with its $1.5 billionacquisition of the tire maker.   Uniroyal's 14 1/2% subordinated debentures, maturing in2000, ended at about 113, an increase of about seven pointsin the last two sessions.   Most other junk bonds, speculative-grade securities withlow credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, prices endedunchanged.   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, activelytraded issues closed between 1/8 point to 1/4 point lower.   About $400 million in new corporate debt was pricedyesterday, including a $200 million issue of five-year notesby Morgan Stanley Group Inc. The noncallable notes werepriced to yield 9.907%. The size of the issue was increasedfrom an originally planned $150 million.                                                                                                          Foreign Bonds                                                                                                          Long-term British government bonds plunged on news thatthe nation's current account and merchandise trade deficitsin March both came in at #2.18 billion ($3.56 billion), upfrom #1.39 billion in February. Market expectations had beenfor deficits of #1.3 billion.   British bonds fell more than a point just minutes afterthe reports were released. The pound also fell, prompting theBank of England to intervene in the foreign exchange marketsin an effort to boost the currency's value.   &quot;This market has had nothing but bad news for weeks,&quot; saidone trader. &quot;Then along come these awful trade numbers and alot of investors just figured enough is enough. So theydumped.&quot;   Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major attempted to calmthe markets with a series of radio and television interviews.He blamed the deficits on erratic items and noted thatexports are growing four times as fast as imports.   He reiterated his belief that the trade data don't warranta change in economic policy. Some market participantsinterpreted Mr. Major's remarks to suggest that thegovernment will keep base lending rates at their currentlevel of 15%.   Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% Treasury bond due 2003/2007fell 1 13/32 points to 94 27/32 to yield 12.48%. Shorter-termsecurities posted more modest losses. Futures prices alsoslid.   Elsewhere, West German government bonds ended 1/4 pointhigher despite a bearish report from the Bundesbank.   The central bank warned of rising inflationary risks asincome tax cuts, increased government spending and theplanned monetary union with East Germany boost demand forgoods and services. Monetary union is expected to take effectJuly 2.   West Germany's benchmark 7 3/4% bond due 2000 rose 0.25point to 93.40 to yield 8.77%.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          The benchmark 30-year bond was 32 to yield 8.96% onTuesday. The latest 10-year notes ended at 96 25/32 to yield8.98% compared with 96 27/32 to yield 8.97%.   Short-term rates were a little higher. The discount rateon three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.78% for a bondequivalent yield of 8.025% while the rate on six-month billsrose to 7.96% to yield 8.387%.   Here are details of yesterday's two-year note auction:                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

Mortgage-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage securities came under pressure after aninstitution sold several hundred million dollars ofGovernment National Mortgage Association's 9% securities andbuyers remained scarce. Active mortgage issues fell 3/32 to7/32.   Ginnie Mae's 9% issue for May delivery ended at 93 20/32,down 7/32; its 9 1/2% issue at 96 7/32, down 6/32, and its10% issue at 98 26/32, down 5/32.   Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal NationalMortgage Association issues continued to hold up better thanGinnie Maes because the conventional issues are favored inderivative transactions. Also, they have shorter averagelives and durations than the Ginnie Maes.   Freddie Mac's 9 1/2% issue fell 3/32 to 96 3/32 whileFannie Mae's 9 1/2% securities dropped 3/32 to 96 5/8.   Fannie Mae announced two real estate mortgage investmentconduit, or Remic, issues totaling $550 million. Thatfollowed $850 million in Remics issued Tuesday by Fannie Maeand Freddie Mac.   In the asset-backed securities market, Citicorp continuedits heavy sales of credit-card certificates, offering a $250million issue to retail investors through an underwritinggroup led by Shearson Lehman Hutton.   The five-year issue was priced with a bond equivalentyield of 9.41%, 45 basis points above the Treasury five-yearnote. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.

Several traders have reported light activity this week, asinvestors seem to be biding their time anticipating furthermunicipal price declines.   In negotiated action, a Bear Stearns andamp; Co. group set thepreliminary pricing for a $55.1 million issue of New JerseyHealth Care Facilities Finance Authority hospital revenuebonds. The issue was priced to yield from 8% in 2000 to 8.47%in 2013.   Among dollar bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20%bonds were 1/2 point lower at 95 1/2 to yield 7.57%.
