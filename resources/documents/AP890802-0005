(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   This northwestern Minnesota town with 250students is challenging larger districts in the state to top itsattendance record and graduation rate.   Rothsay, in fact, is willing to give $500 in scholarship moneyto the first three districts that can top its accomplishments. Thechallenge is aimed at districts with more than 4,000 students.   ``We've been listening to things like, `Bigger is better,' ''said Tom Fosse, a school board member and president of the RothsayCommunity Development Corp., which is providing the money. ``We'resaying maybe that's not true.''   Rothsay is issuing the challenge in response to a legislativeauditor's report issued in December saying some of the state'ssmallest school districts are not providing students with a goodeducation and should be phased out.   ``When you read the report, it just sounds like we're doing sucha terrible job with our young folks,'' said DuWayne Balken,chairman of the school board. ``We believe that's not true at all.They're very well prepared.''   School districts accepting the challenge must meet or exceedRothsay's record in average daily attendance and graduation ratesover the last three school years.   The challenge also includes the rate of extracurricularparticipation, the percentage of high school graduates who entereda post-secondary school and the percentage that earned degrees froma four-year institution, all during the last three years.   School officials are confident even though they haven't checkednumbers to see how Rothsay has fared in those categories.   ``We know they're high,'' Fosse said. ``We're confident thatwe'll stack up well. We're waiting for a challenge.''</TEXT></DOC>
