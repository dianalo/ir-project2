(letter to the editor)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Small, Steven F.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>EXABYTE TAXES EXCEPTIONandM;I would like to take exception to remarks contained in an article entitled&quot;Trimarchi DAT Storage System Connects Directly to Ethernet&quot; (Nov.andP;  27, 1989,page 1), and in particular to a comment made by Thomas Trimachi, president ofTrimarchi, in describing his company's entry into the digital audiotape (DAT)market.andP;  His statement was that DAT is &quot;supposed to be inherently morereliable than 8mm because it is digital as opposed to analog.&quot;andM;The Exabyte 8mm tape drive referred to by Trimarchi employs no video (henceanalog) techniques or circuitry.andP;  The Exabyte data format, error correctioncodes, buffer management algorithms and error recovery procedures are theresult of a two-year development effort to design a data processing device.andO;The result is six custom gate arrays and an associated full digital elecronicread/write data path.andM;Exabyte has proven its data integrity specification, which is a bit errorrate of 1 in [10.sup.13], both in the field and in the laboratory--somethingDAT has yet to achieve.andP;  This specification, which is superior to most dataintegrity specifications for Winchester disk drives, is the result ofemploying read-after-write and ECC tecniques.andP;  During a write operation, onehead writes the data while the other head performs the read-back check.andP;  On aread operation, both heads read the data for redundancy, contributing to thehigh data reliability figures.andP;  It is important to note that only 8mmtechnology uses a full upstream erase head to eliminate residual servo anddata signals, which can interfere with new data.andP;  This is significant wheninterchanging tapes between devices is important.andM;Because the 8mm data format was developed from the ground up, no artificialconstraints or limitations were placed on the device.andP;  The goal of tapestorage as a data processing device is to create perfect tapes with noerrors.andP;  In contrast to the DAT fromat, the Exabyte format is block-orientedrather than group-oriented.andP;  If the read-back check during a write operationdetects an error in the block, it is corrected in a seamless way by rewritingthe 1KB block 11 blocks later in the data stream.andP;  Because the amount of datathat must be rewritten is minimized, media capacity is preserved.andP;  DAT usersmust live with an 11.5KB rewrite penalty for even single-byte errors.andP;  Onecan see how random errors would contribute to the loss of a significantamount of DAT tape capacity.andP;  This overhead is the result of adapting aconsumer music recording device for data storage purposes.andM;Finally, Trimarchi erroneously said, &quot;Exabyte, based in Boulder, Colo., isthe single source for 8mm drives.&quot;andP;  Exabyte drives come from two sources.andP;  Inaddition to the Boulder facility, Kubota of Osaka, Japan, provides Exabytewith second-source, alternate-site manufacturing capability.andM;I hope this explanation serves to set the record straight on the similaritiesand differences between 8mm and DAT data storage devices and the inherentreliability of each.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
