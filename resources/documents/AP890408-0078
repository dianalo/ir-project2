He called it ``the lowest and loneliest moment'' in his895-day presidency.   ``Nowadays, more often than not, I'm introduced as Betty Ford'shusband,'' Ford joked Friday.   He spoke at a forum entitled ``Gerald Ford: Restoring thePresidency,'' the seventh presidential conference held at HofstraUniversity on Long Island in a series that began in 1982 with afocus on Franklin D. Roosevelt.   Ford learned on Sept. 28, 1974, less than two months afterPresident Nixon resigned and he took office, that Mrs. Ford hadbreast cancer, he said.   Ford said he was proud of his wife's evolution into a leadingspokeswoman on breast cancer and alcohol addiction.   Ford, a tanned and trim 75, said he and Jimmy Carter, whodefeated Ford in 1976, have become close friends.   Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, who served as Ford's chief ofstaff, said the Ford presidency represented the ``fundamentalsuccess of the constitutional system. ... In the face of nearlycertain impeachment of a president, the political processfunctioned superbly.''   Cheney also praised Ford for restoring the nation's confidencein the presidency.   ``Gerald Ford regained for the institution of the presidency therespect and power it required to direct this republic in a time oftremendous challenge,'' Cheney said.</TEXT><DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla.

The former PTL leader is now affiliated with the New CovenantChristian Church of Cranesville, Pa., a town of 700 people.   Herbert Moore, treasurer of Bakker's New Covenant Church inCharlotte, N.C., told The Orlando Sentinel that Bakker'scertificate with the Pennsylvania church became effective lastmonth.

More than 200 representatives of colleges and scholarlyorganizations attended Friday's inauguration at the park-likecampus, said Occidental spokeswoman Frances Hill.   Slaughter, the school's 11th president, physically took over thejob last August when Dr. Richard C. Gilman resigned the post, whichhe had held for 23 years.   Slaughter, 55, had been chancellor of the University ofMaryland, and previously was director of the National ScienceFoundation.   Since its founding in 1887, Occidental College had been a small,prestigious liberal arts college with a mostly white studentpopulation. The fact that Slaughter is black, and his extensivebackground in engineering, appealed to the board of trustees, Ms.Hill said.   ``There was a recognition by the trustees, who are largely whitemales ... that change is coming, that the next century is going torequire a different approach,'' she said.   ``The population of California shows you that white males arebecoming a minority. There was a feeling among the trustees that weneeded to find somebody who bridges many fields, many cultures.''   Slaughter, born in Topeka, Kan., received his Bachelor ofScience degree from Kansas State University in 1956. He receivedhis doctorate degree from the University of California in San Diegoin 1971.</TEXT><NOTE>Eds: Similar version moved on sports wires</NOTE><DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo.
