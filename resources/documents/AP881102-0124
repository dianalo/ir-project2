The assaults came one day after a mortar attack on theNational Guard headquarters.   The army post attacked today was guarding a sugar refinery.   ``They attacked us with mortars and rifle fire ... damaged theoffices and killed four soldiers ... and wounded four others,'' saidthe head of security at the refinery who identified himself as Sgt.Sandoval.   He said the attack began shortly after midnight and lastedseveral hours.   About the same time, rebels attacked national guardsmen at theLas Canas bridge just north of San Salvador, military sources said.Two guardsmen were killed and several guerrillas wounded in the30-minute attack, they said.   Four soldiers were killed and 37 wounded in the attack on theNational Guard headquarters Tuesday. Two guard barracks weredestroyed.   The guerrillas' clandestine Radio Venceremos called Tuesday'sattack in the northern part of this capital a ``welcome'' to Col.Rene Emilio Ponce on the first day of his new job as military chiefof staff.   National Guard commander Col. Jose Humberto Gomez suffered ashrapnel wound to a leg, and eight guardsmen were reported incritical condition, a defense ministry spokesman said. Sevencivilians also were wounded.   One of two parked cars packed with explosives about a block fromthe base exploded during the 45-minute attack Tuesday, damagingnearby vehicles and homes. Army munitions experts de-activatedexplosives in the other car.   Rebel mortar fire set off grenades stored inside the mainbuilding at the compound and panicked residents of the poor,working-class neighborhood that surrounds the site.   National Guard officers at the site said they believed the 81mmmortars were launched from La Lomita, a hillock about 530 yards eastof the compound.   Deputy Public Security Minister Col. Leopoldo Hernandez said thesalvo destroyed two guard barracks.   Col. Ponce said the attack was carried out by urban commandos ofthe Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the umbrella group offive leftist guerrilla organizations.   Ponce said about 15 rebels participated in the attack, which hedescribed as being staged for ``propagandistic'' purposes.   Hernandez said the surprise attack ``doesn't mean there wasneglect by the security forces or the National Guard. What happenedis, there isn't any way to stop a mortar attack.''   The guard forms part of El Salvador's armed forces andparticipates in counterinsurgency operations.   Radio Venceremos, in a statement received in Mexico City, saidrebels attacked a prison and blew up an electricity substation inSensuntepeque, 50 miles northeast of San Salvador.   Military sources confirmed rebels attacked the prison there forfour hours Monday night, but there were no injuries or escapes.   In another statement, Venceremos said army forces suffered 479casualties, including dead and wounded, in combat during October. Itdid not provide a breakdown or a rebel casualty figure.   It said the guerrillas were stepping up the urban war in anoffensive called ``Death to Reagan's Policy, Yankees Out of ElSalvador.''   The attacks came as guerrilla leaders embarked on a tour to briefLatin American leaders on the possibility of resuming peace talkswith the government.   Front commanders Leonel Gonzalez and Joaquin Villalobos metMonday in Panama City with Roman Catholic archbishop Arturo RiveraDamas, who said he presented a report on proposals for a negotiatedend to the 9-year conflict that has claimed 65,000 lives.   Rivera Damas declined to elaborate.   Salvadoran church leaders have mediated the few meetings betweenthe government and rebels. The last meeting was Oct. 20, 1987, inSan Salvador.   Meanwhile, negotiations continued late Tuesday with inmatesholding at least three hostages at a prison in Quezaltepeque, 15miles north of San Salvador.   Six inmates there demanded political asylum in Mexico in exchangefor the hostages' release, a prison official said.   One inmate yelled out a window to reporters that his group washolding 12 hostages. Clutching a pistol and a grenade, he threatenedto amputate their arms and legs if the asylum demands were not met.   Col. Miguel Vasconcelos, commander of the army brigade that hassurrounded the prison, said the hostage-taking incident began Mondaynight when prisoners jumped two guards and took their rifles.</TEXT></DOC>
