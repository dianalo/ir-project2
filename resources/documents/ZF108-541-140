 Those of youwho are reading this probably don't give it a second thought, but visuallyimpaired workers use speech synthesis or Braille displays to run computers.andM;Unfortunately, GUIs are incompatible with these systems, making the computerseffectively inaccessible.andM;When the Americans With Disabilities Act becomes law, government and manybusiness users will have to buy only equipment that can be readily adapted touse by the disabled.andP;  This would seem to spell big trouble for universal useof GUIs.andM;Another thing -- wasn't Windows supposed to make programming so much easierso that applications would just flood onto the market?andM;Everything is provided in the environment, so, the argument went, all theprogrammer has to do is add a short program and you have a word processor ordatabase, with no more fooling around with writing special screen and otherinput/output utilities.andM;The same basic argument was used for Presentation Manager, yet MicrosoftCorp. and IBM Corp. still haven't gotten around to providing enough printerdrivers for OS/2.andP;  In its own way, Windows is even worse.andM;We only now are seeing powerful third-party Windows word processors, such asAtlanta, Ga.-based Samna Corp.'s Ami Professional.andM;Ami Pro is a very nice program, and if you run Windows, it is an excellentchoice.andP;  But if Windows is so easy to program for, why do Windows programstake so long to develop and why are they as large as similar programs runningunder plain vanilla MS-DOS?andM;Terrific!andP;  Some programs were slow to adopt pull-down menus that make themeasier for beginners to use.andP;  Because purchasing decisions were made withoutconsidering how hard some programs are to learn, we are facing a flood ofGUIs that slow down performance, cause programming headaches, require heavygraphics capabilities, and add another layer of complexity, all to write aletter.andM;With 80 percent of Americans saying they want to lose weight, isn't it timewe start asking why programs always have to be so large?andP;  It's time to putsoftware on a diet also.andM;Let's face it -- except for those needing special graphics, typography ortight integration, Windows is a waste of system space and software money.andM;All average users need is a simple menu system such as Norton Commander fromPeter Norton Computing Inc. of Santa Monica, Calif., along with more carefulselection of easy-to-learn applications.andM;GUIs?andP;  Power users, arise and just say no!andM;Of course, I expect lots of argument from general users.andP;  Forget that addingmore layers of software removes control from the user and that computers arealready so powerful that users should be required to learn something aboutthem before being turned loose with all that power.andM;GUIs have the same fascination that the automatic transmission has.andP;  They aregreat in the city, but everyone should be required to prove competence bylearning to use a stick shift before being licensed to drive a 3,000-poundweapon at 60 mph down a crowded highway, or learn a dozen MS-DOS commandsbefore being turned loose with the record of someone's life or business on adatabase.andM;I'll take a look at some specific GUIs in a later column when I calm down abit.andM;John McCormick, a free-lance writer and computer consultant, has been workingwith computers since the early 1960s.andP;  He welcomes mail from readers.andP;  Writeto him care of Government Computer News, 8601 Georgia Ave., Suite 300, SilverSpring, Md.andP;  20910.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
