Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, leader of the guerrilla group Hezb-i-Islami,said the government ``will fall in weeks, not months.'' He addresseda news conference in Peshawar, a frontier city where a seven-partyguerrilla alliance has its headquarters.   Neighboring Pakistan and Iran, meanwhile, urged the factions toend their squabbles and form a broad-based government in Kabul whenthe Soviet withdrawal is completed. Pakistan and Iran support theguerrillas.   The Soviet army is due to complete its withdrawal fromAfghanistan by Feb. 15 under a U.N.-brokered accord signed lastApril.   Hekmatyar said the insurgents were determined to avoid attacks onKabul, the Afghan capital, and other cities that would endangercivilian lives. More than 2 million people, including many refugees,have crammed into Kabul.   ``The whole world will be witness to the fact that Kabul willfall without any major onslaught on the city,'' Hekmatyar said.   Abdul Haq, a senior military leader, said field commanders willneed plans for the administration of towns and cities that fall tothem, for bringing in food, and keeping water and power systemsoperating.   ``Before we knew only to attack the Russians,'' he said in aninterview. ``Now we must secure the nation, establish law and order,feed the people, stop looting or killing. It is very difficult.''   He said the Kabul regime was preparing to defend itself and about5,000 special troopers had returned from training in the SovietUnion in house-to-house fighting. The government also isstrengthening such elite formations as the presidential guard andsecret police militia, Haq said.   Afghanistan's conscript army shows signs of collapse and is oflittle use for major operations, he said, adding that governmentforces generally are confined to cities and large towns, leaving thecountryside to the guerrillas.   Haq said the guerrillas must find a way army units can surrendersafely and without fear of reprisal so they will not be compelled tofight. ``We should not make them fight for survival,'' he said.   Hekmatyar told the news conference there were arrangements forsecuring the fall of major cities without large-scale attacks, butgave no details. Other guerrilla groups said they were unaware ofsuch plans.   Most of the nation's industry, agriculture and public facilitieshave been destroyed by the civil war, which began after a communistcoup in April 1978. Soviet soldiers intervened in December 1979 andan estimated 115,000 were in Afghanistan when the withdrawal beganin May under a U.N.-mediated agreement.   Members of the seven-party alliance are trying to reach agreementon a provisional government, but are deeply divided on sharing powerand other important issues.   Syed Ahmed Gailani, head of the National Islamic Front ofAfghanistan, told reporters Thursday in Islamabad efforts were underway to form an interim government. He indicated there were problems,but did not elaborate.   Ali Akbar Velayati and Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, foreign ministers ofIran and Pakistan, appealed for guerrilla unity after two days ofmeetings in Islamabad that ended Thursday, Pakistani diplomats said.   A coalition of eight resistance groups is based in Iran. Most ofthe guerrillas in Iran are Shiite Moslems, and those in Pakistanlargely follow the predominant Sunni branch of Islam.</TEXT></DOC>
