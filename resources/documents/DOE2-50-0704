Radio-labelled[8-{sup 14}C] adenosine was used in incorporation studies. In high viability,high vigor embryos, the content of nucleoside triphosphates and UDP-sugarsincreased rapidly upon imbibition, while the content of adenosine decreased.Embryos which were only just viable had a larger content of endogenousadenosine at quiescence than high viability embryos. Radiolabeled [8-{sup14}C]adenosine was incorporated into the adenylate nucleotides and RNA,within the first 5 minutes of imbibition. In high viability embryos,of both high and reduced vigor, exogenously supplied [8-{sup 14}C]adenosineresulted in an increase in ATP content during imbibition.</TEXT></DOC>
