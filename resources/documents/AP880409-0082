The court exempted from the takeover several cars and somejewelry and real estate but allowed the seizure of bank accountsand some property.   Esmat Sadat, brother of the slain Egyptian president, said hewould appeal on behalf of himself, three of his sons and sevenother relatives involved in the case.   He said the case was politically motivated and aimed at smearinghis brother's name and presidential tenure.   The 11 were charged in 1982, a year after Anwar Sadat'sassassination, with amassing millions of dollars through influencepeddling, bribery and other corruption. At that time, theirproperty was sequestered for five years.   They were convicted on 24 counts of influence peddling, blackmarketeering and bribery.   The court said that there was no evidence the president was tiedin any way to illicit activities.   Early this month, the nation's prosecutor general demandedconfiscation of $8.2 million worth of property, exempting from therequest a car and an apartment for each defendant.   Saturday's court session was for the reading of the verdict.Flanked by two of his sons, Esmat Sadat sat quietly fingering worrybeads and waited for Sayed Abdel-Baky, president of the seven-mantribunal, to read it.   ``This is politics, this is a public opinion case, and Iexpected no less,'' Sadat told reporters afterward. ``Many otherswere let off without confiscation. Why us?''   Esmat Sadat went into private business in 1973 during hisbrother's third year as president after 30 years as a bus companyemployee. His salary when he left the company was about $100 amonth.</TEXT></DOC>
