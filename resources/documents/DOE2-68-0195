It examines applications where the end user can install a primemover and to thus satisfy those mechanical needs without the inefficiency,and the resulting higher operating costs, of a more conventional utilitysystem. Each of the prime movers that are commercially available foruse in on-site systems including reciprocating internal combustion engines,combustion gas turbines and steam boiler-turbine systems are reviewedin this section. These prime movers are available in sizes ranging froma few horsepower through to well over 500,000 horsepower. In addition,this Section will review factory-assembled or packaged cogeneration systems,a concept that has brought the benefits of on-site cogeneration systemsto even the small commercial and institutional energy user.</TEXT></DOC>
