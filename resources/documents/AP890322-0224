ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fawn Hall, Oliver North's former secretary,testified at his trial Wednesday that she had few qualms aboutaltering and shredding top secret documents the day beforeinvestigators were due because of her complete trust in him.   ``I worked for Colonel North closely for four years,'' she said.``He was a man whose character I knew well. I knew there was areason why he was doing this.''   An intense, but composed witness, Miss Hall recounted thefrenzied activity in North's White House office on Nov. 21, 1986after the administration became aware that money from arms sales toIran had been used to aid the guerrillas fighting in Nicaragua.   She said North, a top aide on the National Security Council,asked her to make changes in some documents brought out from theNSC's top secret ``System Four'' files. The changes, which he markedfor her, all involved retyping the documents, with sometimes subtleand sometimes wholesale alterations.   ``I made the changes and assembled the packages and began toXerox them,'' she said.   ``What did you do with the originals?'' asked prosecutor JohnKeker.   ``I shredded those and destroyed them.''   ``Why did you do that?''   ``It was the logical thing to do,'' she said.   Asked by the prosecutor whether she had any qualms about heractions, she said, ``There was a moment when I paused.''   Questioned by the judge, she said that neither North nor anyoneelse instructed her to destroy the papers.   The documents that North was having redone were six so-called1985 ``problem memos'' that indicated North's deep involvement inthe Contra aid efforts and knowledge of them by national securityadviser Robert McFarlane at a time when such aid was barred byCongress.   Miss Hall said she recognized that these were the documents fromidentifying numbers. She said that when they were prepared a yearbefore, North made jokes that because of them he might have to go tojail for them.   ``If you knew Colonel North well,'' she said, ``he had a greatability of relieving tension ... he had a great sense of humor.''   The day after the shredding, investigators for Attorney GeneralEdwin Meese III came to the office. She testified that she had notknown that the investigators were coming.   Miss Hall's testimony went directly to three of the 12 criminalcharges on which North is being tried: obstruction of Congress bythe creation of false and misleading chronologies and altering anddestroying documents; obstruction of a presidential inquiry;altering and concealing documents.   Miss Hall now works for the William Morris talent agency, but didnot say what she does.   On Nov. 25, 1986, four days after the shredding incident, Northwas fired from the National Security Council and Miss Hall said thattwo NSC aides came in to seal up the office.   Hall said that as she went through documents in the office forNorth's successors, she found minutes of former McFarlane's meetingin Tehran. She also found notes and copies of the documents she hadaltered.   She said before she left she put the Tehran minutes in one of theboots she was wearing and put the altered documents in the otherboot.   ``It was a very stupid thing that I did that day,'' she said.   Earlier, a Switzerland-based lawyer who set up dummy companiesfor the Iran-Contra operation testified that $28.6 million flowedinto the companies' bank accounts between February and late Octoberof 1986.   Willard Zucker, born in Brooklyn but living in Geneva for 20years, testified that he was approached in 1984 by Albert Hakim, alongtime client, who wanted to establish a company.   ``There was a project to purchase arms and munitions or both,''Zucker said. ``We were requested to facilitate payments, open bankaccounts on instructions by Hakim and Secord.'' His reference was toRichard Secord, a retired Air Force major general who sold arms tothe Contras _ and a North co-defendant.   Investigations concluded that money from sales of U.S. arms toIran went through those companies to purchase covert military aidfor the Contras.   Among the companies Zucker set up were Lake Resources, Inc., HydePark Square Corporation and Energy Resources International. Hetestified _ without providing any details _ that ``distributions''from their accounts went to ACE, EAST, Southern Air Transport andRafael Quintero.   ACE, an acronym for Amalgamated Commercial Enterprise Inc. wasused as a front for the services of Southern Air, which assisted inthe Contra resupply operation. Eagle Aviation Services andTechnology, or EAST, provided pilots and supplies to that operation.Southern Air, a former CIA property, was involved both in the Contraresupply operation and the Reagan administration's secret arms salesto Iran. Quintero is a Cuban-American who helped coordinate theresupply effort.   Zucker testified that the first three deposits totaling $10million were made in February, around the time that nationalsecurity adviser John M. Poindexter is said to have approved thediversion of Iran arms sale money to the Contras.   On May 15, the record showed another $10 million deposit. Thefollowing day, North sent Poindexter a computer note saying thecompanies controlled by Secord and Hakim had ``more than $6 millionavailable for immediate disbursement.'' Four days later, another $5million went into the account.   In his congressional testimony, Poindexter said he believed theSecord-Hakim operation was supplying the Contra all of the surplusfrom the Iran arms sales. But later it developed that only $3.8million of a $16.1 million surplus had gone to the rebels.   Zucker also testified about $3.6 million credited to Hyde ParkSquare Corporation on Oct. 28. He said that ``an Iranian gentleman''was behind that bank account.   In other trial testimony, former CIA employee Glenn Robinettecontradicted grand jury testimony he gave two years ago.   Robinette said he was trying to protect Secord by covering up _in an April 22, 1987 grand jury appearance _ the fact that it wasSecord who paid for a $13,800 security fence at North's home.Robinette testified at that time that an exchange of phonyback-dated bills and correspondence between him and North was realand accurate.</TEXT></DOC>
