(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Pedigree retrieversandM;Recall Plus from Bristol-based Insoft is now into version 3.andP;  It's the latestdevelopment of this full text retrieval program which has built up a loyalfollowing in the UK.andP;  Recall Plus is a complete system supporting both textindexing and comprehensive retrieval facilities -- with a separate run-timeretrieval system if required.andP;  Recall Plus is widely used to gain fast accessto electronically stored text such as office correspondence, minutes, pressreleases, reports, regulations, on-line manuals and email.andM;Recall Plus processes text files in word processor or ASCII format to storethem in libraries.andP;  It holds the text in ASCII form plus the index files thatgive the fast access.andP;  Each library can be structured into chapters anddocuments added to specific chapters as required.andM;Within each library, documents can be added to or deleted from a library asrequired.andP;  A library is restricted to either 65,000 documents, 65,000different words, 65,000 chapters or 2Gb of file space.andP;  Retrieval ofinformation can be made on simple words or phrases or, as expected from acomputer-based system, made highly specific through the use of the AND, OR,NOT logical operators with proximity control.andM;Over the years, Recall Plus has increased its facilities and dramaticallyimproved its user-interface, all of which means that it has become much moreuser-friendly.andP;  One improvement is that throughout its functions, allon-screen displays have been made more informative -- telling you what RecallPlus is currently doing and what further functions are available.andP;  RecallPlus now works through a good pull-down menu system with consistent use offunction keys throughout all functions -- making the program much easier tolearn for new users.andP;  There's also a new and very good on-line help system.andM;To prepare files for indexed retrieval, they're first processed to removeword processor-specific formatting information.andP;  Recall Plus will nowrecognize WordPerfect, WordStar, Multimate, DisplayWrite, Smart and MicrosoftWord formats and breaks these files into paragraphs.andP;  At the end of thisprocessing stage, Recall Plus has stripped all the formatting out of thefiles and created plain ASCII files ready for indexing.andM;When files are being selected for processing, the improvement in theinterface can be seen.andP;  It's now possible to move around directories and viewtheir contents to locate individual files for processing -- this is a greatimprovement over version 2.andM;Indexing processed files is equally straight forward -- simply a matter offollowing on-screen prompts to select a target directory and then hitting thekey.andP;  Using a 12MHz Zenith TurbosPort 386 PC with no disk cacheing active,preprocessing 19 WordPerfect 5.1 files with a total size of 254Kb took about30 seconds.andP;  It then took Recall Plus between six and seven minutes to indexthem -- a modest rate of about 2.5 Mb per hour.andP;  After indexing, the RecallPlus library occupied 568Kb -- an overhead of about 120 per cent, which isgrossly inefficient.andP;  However, increasing the size of the library makes theindex proportionately smaller and instant Recall also includes a utility tocompress the index.andP;  Insoft actually quotes an average figure of 30 per centfor large libraries.andM;Recall Plus retrieval facilities are excellent, individual chapters ordocuments can be browsed or the searching facilities used to locate chapters,documents or paragraphs containing a search phrase.andP;  Searching works well --first a word or phrase is entered and if a stem plus wildcard is enteredRecall Plus displays all words containing that stem that it's indexed,letting you select those that are appropriate.andP;  For example, the stem infomight produce information, informative and so on.andM;Once Recall Plus has made its search, you then have the choice of firstbrowsing the documents or paragraphs containing the hits, or of restrictingor expanding the search by using the logical operators AND, OR or NOT to linkin further search words or phrases.andP;  Recall Plus also lets you set theproximity of the linked search criteria for more efficient retrieval.andP;  OtherRecall Plus features that add to its effectiveness are a Thesaurus facilityletting users define synonyms to standard search terms that are then usedautomatically during searches and an editable stopword list which is used toexclude common or redundant words from the indexing process.andM;I've got a number of misgivings about version 3: the indexing speed is modestand the indexing overhead was worrying; the documentation is really referencematerial and needs a tutorial introduction.andP;  Also, Recall Plus doesn't knowabout printer types -- users are left to input printer setup strings and soon.andP;  Given the improvements and sophistication of other Recall Plus functionsin these departments, the package remains primitive.andP;  That said, version 3 ofRecall Plus has transformed the product into an easy-to-use and powerful freetext retrieval program that can be used safely for personal or office textretrieval.andP;  It can also be used for the preparation of information packs forclients along with the run-time text retrieval program.andM;Folio Views from the US Folio Corporation is a text retrieval programincorporating recent IT-based retrieval tools along with familiar and moretraditional index-based searching.andP;  First, as its name suggests, this newsoftware lets an author or reader actively collect documents into views onthe basis of the information they contain.andP;  A view is a collection ofdocuments or articles relating to a common topic decided either by an authordesigning an information base or, on the fly, by a reader wanting toselectively organize information for immediate needs.andP;  A view effectivelyacts to restrict the amount of text that a reader has to work with.andM;A second IT feature for PC text-retrieval programs is Folio Views' ability tolet an author or reader add structure to any document or collection ofdocuments by placing hypertext links.andP;  A hypertext link lets the reader jumpfrom one part of a document to another or from document to document byplacing the cursor on a link icon and hitting Enter.andP;  In a more traditionalvein, every document to be accessed via Folio Views has to be pre-processedfor its contents to be indexed.andP;  The index files then allow fast access totext via searches on keywords linked by logical operators, subject toproximity restrictions if required.andM;So, what do you have to do to put Folio Views' powerful text retrieval toolsto work?andP;  The first thing is to get the information in electronic form in aseries of ASCII files, either using a word processor or using Folio View'sown excellent word processing facilities.andP;  In Folio Views' terminology asingle DOS file is called a folio and a collection of folios an infobase.andO;Folios are then indexed and linked to an infobase via an external programcalled Create which, unfortunately, requires information as a command-linestring to get it going.andP;  Once several folios have been linked together intoan infobase in this way, they can each be browsed through, in their ownwindows, or accessed using Folio Views' powerful searching procedures.andM;What sort of assistance does the Folio Views unique combination of facilitiesgive?andP;  Let's take the case of an executive who regularly extracts informationfrom an electronic news agency on a variety of aspects of the PC industry,such as financial information about company trading positions and newproducts.andP;  On a daily basis each item is processed and linked into aninfobase.andP;  In preparing an article -- for example, on the acquisition ofZenith Data Systems by Groupe Bull -- the Views facility can be used toselectively organize the mass of information.andP;  Here, by searching fordocuments that contain Zenith, Zenith Data Systems, Bull and Groupe Bull,Folio locates a number of items that can then be selected and pasted intotheir own named View.andM;In future, readers can access these items without going through the searchprocedure and add or delete items as necessary.andP;  A View presents its items asa stack of windows with one item per window and text scrolling within eachwindow -- with full screen viewing.andP;  Next, Folio View's linking facility canbe used to add structure to the infobase.andP;  One good way to use links is as anintroductory menu to views that have been created.andP;  Here, the word processingfacility is used to create a list of views and then each item in the list islinked to its view.andP;  A link point is shown as an inverted triangle andplacing the cursor on a link point and hitting Enter automatically turns theelectronic pages to take you to the link terminator.andM;Folio Views' flexible philosophy means that its word processor can be used toedit text within an infobase or to add new information.andP;  In this case, theindexes are updated on the fly so that changes are immediately available.andO;Finally, Folio Views' indexing speed is good, and its indexing strategy isexcellent.andP;  Once Create has finished, the original text files can bediscarded leaving files about 60 per cent of the original size, and text canbe exported to the printer or an ASCII disk file.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
