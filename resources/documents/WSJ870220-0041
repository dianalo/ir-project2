Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration, testified before a Senate Appropriations Committee panel that aid may be required if litigation blocking the shifting of funds within the system isn't resolved soon, and system banks don't improve operations, including revamping loans for their financially shaky farmer-borrowers.    Without these changes, the need for congressional action &quot;to deal with these problems and get the system back on its feet . . . is a real possibility,&quot; Mr. Naylor said. But he told the agriculture subcommittee that such assistance would most likely be loan guarantees or other indirect help, and not any &quot;hard capital.&quot;    The system this week reported a $1.9 billion loss for 1986 after a 1985 loss of $2.7 billion; problem loans and foreclosed farmland continued to increase.    Mr. Naylor said the FCA is working with the Treasury Department, the congressional General Accounting Office and some agricultural policy-makers on Capitol Hill on possible legislative remedies for the beleaguered farm-credit lender. But he said his agency won't make any formal proposals itself.    Other FCA officials said indirect aid like guarantees would mostly suffice. While the government may later provide small amounts of emergency federal cash for system units that are particularly weak, the FCA officials did rule out any massive federal assistance.    Jim Billington, one of the FCA's three directors, said in an interview that under a 1985 law his agency, in effect, would request federal aid for system banks if it certifies the system no longer has funds to help weaker units.    Some FCA officials have said the agency can't make that ruling as long as system resources haven't been fully used to help the ailing units. Mr. Billington said that with litigation preventing that self-help process, &quot;we're getting very close&quot; to being able to certify the system needs federal help.    Meanwhile, Brent Beesley, president of the Farm Credit Corp. of America, the system's Denver-based policy arm, said the banks aren't seeking federal aid now, but officials are studying ways Congress might restructure the system.    Mr. Beesley insisted that stronger system banks want to shift to weaker units as much money as they can without putting themselves in jeopardy; some 20 lawsuits blocking this process, he said, reflect particular quarrels with FCA regulations governing loss-sharing. Sentiment is building in Congress for a plan, backed by Mr. Naylor and others, that would avert further demands for wealthier system units to give funds to weaker ones.    Senate Agriculture Chairman Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) said recently that in enacting new legislation, &quot;We won't penalize those farm credit banks . . . that remain healthy.&quot; Sen. Leahy's home state is in the system's Springfield, Mass., district, where a federal judge this week struck down FCA rules for transfer of funds from wealthier units like the Springfield banks to shakier units in the system.    Even many legislators from areas served by the weakest Farm Credit banks may welcome the plan's gaining support in Congress. That proposal would stress decentralization, giving more local control and easing demands on wealthier units to help failing ones. The legislators see it as offering federal aid in place of the currently litigation-stalled plan for stronger units to bail out weaker ones.    &quot;The longer these court cases stay out, the longer the poorer banks are going to be in jeopardy,&quot; said Rep. Fred Grandy (R., Iowa), whose congressional district is served by the system's struggling Omaha, Neb., district. </TEXT></DOC>
