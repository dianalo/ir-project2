Roberts (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT TCOMA </CO><IN> TEL </IN><G> FCC </G><TEXT>   The Commerce Department's telecommunications office is recommending major changes in cable-TV regulations to open the market to new competition and address growing concerns about concentration of power in the industry.    In a report due for release today, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration recommends that telephone companies be freed to provide certain cable services. It also urges the elimination of rules barring networks from owning cable systems, the abolition of exclusive cable franchises, and the revocation of the license that allows cable operators to retransmit programs from broadcast television for a nominal fee to copyright owners.    The report also urges the Federal Communications Commission to review levels of concentration in the cable industry, citing in particular the heavy concentration of ownership by Denver-based Tele-Communications Inc., which has 20% of the nation's 42 million cable households.    While the myriad issues regarding cable's growing power have been the subject of scrutiny by both houses of Congress and by the FCC recently, the report is the first position paper of any kind from the Reagan administration.    The National Cable Television Association said it hadn't seen the report and couldn't comment. Some cable industry insiders dismissed it, saying that the report hasn't been certified as the official view of the administration, and that in any event the telecommunications office has no policy-making responsibility.    But the recommendations may have clout with the FCC, which does make policy, and with any new Republican administration, although it isn't clear how they would fare under a Democratic administration. &quot;If you look at the studies and reports by the NTIA, you get pretty good insight into what will happen two or three years later in rule changes,&quot; said Alfred S. Sikes, the assistant secretary for Commerce responsible for the unit.    &quot;There is increasing evidence that one or only a few firms have the ability to create a program distribution 'bottleneck,'&quot; the report said. &quot;The FCC should develop a record on the extent to which (cable operators') market power is precluding the development of alternative media competition.&quot;    The FCC has studied concentration of ownership in the cable industry, but hasn't made any public statement indicating it is concerned. Robert Thomson, vice president of governmental affairs for Tele-Communications, said he couldn't comment directly on the report, but said &quot;our position is that we don't think the cable industry is very concentrated when compared to other companies in the industries we do business with, like the movie studios, or by the standards the federal government uses to measure horizontal concentration.&quot;    The report also said the local practice of awarding exclusive cable franchises has &quot;seriously impeded entry by competitors&quot; and recommends that municipalities encourage competitive cable operators to service a franchise area.    The report also calls for clarifying a number of rules governing telephone company entry into the cable market. Under the terms of the breakup of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., local Bell operating companies were prohibited from providing information services, but there has been no ruling on whether cable is included in that prohibition. However, there is an FCC rule, now under review, that prohibits telephone companies from owning a cable system in their service area. The Cable Act of 1984, which deregulated the cable industry, also contains the prohibition.    The telecommunications office said it didn't recommend any changes in rules prohibiting telephone companies from providing video services directly to subscribers in their service areas. But it said telephone companies should be allowed to act as &quot;video common carriers,&quot; leasing channels to all video programmers. It urged the removal of the current requirement that the telephone companies lease channels only to franchised cable operators or franchising authorities.    Moreover, the report said telephone companies should be allowed to provide services like billing, order taking and system maintenance. &quot;A telephone company could buy an existing cable facility or jointly own a cable facility with a cable operator,&quot; the report said.    The report said concerns about ownership concentration might be reduced by allowing telephone companies to provide a &quot;video dial tone,&quot; leasing one or more video channels to movie studios, cable operators, or sports organizations to distribute programs directly to subscribers.    The report also recommended that a 1970 ban preventing networks from owning cable systems should be lifted because national programming and advertising markets have become much more competitive since the ban was created. </TEXT></DOC>
