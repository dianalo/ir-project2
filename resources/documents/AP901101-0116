(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush would consider a one-on-onemeeting with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein if that would easetensions in the Persian Gulf, first lady Barbara Bush saidThursday.   Mrs. Bush said Americans trapped in Kuwait and Iraq are onBush's mind 24 hours a day.   When asked if Bush would consider meeting face-to-face withSaddam, Mrs. Bush said:   ``I think he would consider anything to get the Kuwaitis back intheir own country, and to get our men out.''   Thousands of troops have been sent to the Persian Gulf sinceIraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. U.S. citizens and others who werein Iraq and Kuwait at the time have been held captive by theIraqis.   Mrs. Bush said she hoped and prayed that force would not benecessary in the crisis.   Mrs. Bush appeared at a news conference to bolster thecongressional campaign of Republican Ally Milder, who facesfirst-term Rep. Peter Hoagland, D-Neb., in next week's election.   Mrs. Bush said she didn't even know Hoagland's name. ``That'show much of a mark he's made in Washington, incidentally,'' Mrs.Bush said.   Later at a speech before a partisan crowd, her last campaignstop of the 1990 elections, Mrs. Bush said Ms. Milder isindependent and wouldn't vote with Bush all of the time.   ``But I know she's going to vote 100 percent of the time for thepeople of Oklahoma,'' Mrs. Bush said, catching herself immediately.``Oh, I knew I'd do that. Last day, last candidate. In Omaha.''   After Mrs. Bush's talk, Ms. Milder presented her with a redNebraska football team sweatshirt for the Bush's dog, Millie.   The sweatshirt's back read: ``Millie for Milder.''   On Wednesday, Mrs. Bush was campaigning in Utah, whereRepublican congressional hopeful Genevieve Atwood assured her thatshe supports the president ``down to my underwear,'' even thoughshe opposed a federal budget bill.   Atwood is challenging incumbent Democrat Wayne Owens in Utah's2nd District.   After Atwood introduced the first lady and said she was a``George Bush supporter right down to my underwear,'' Mrs. Bushreplied, ``I can hardly wait to get back and tell George aboutthat.''</TEXT></DOC>
