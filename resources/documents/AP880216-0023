(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New Hampshire primary voters put theiroften unpredictable mark on the 1988 presidential campaign today,with Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis hoping for a neighborlyboost from the Democrats. On the Republican side, Bob Dole hoped tomake it two victories in a row while George Bush banked on acomeback.   In keeping with longstanding tradition, the 34 voters ofDixville Notch cast their ballots shortly after midnight at theBalsams, a resort hotel, and gave the edge to Bush and DemocratRichard Gephardt.   Statewide, about 150,000 Republicans and 115,000 Democrats wereexpected to vote, according to William Gardner, secretary of state.   ``It feels good, like it did in Iowa last Monday,'' said Dole,referring to the Iowa caucus victory that catapulted him to theforefront of the race.   But Bush, who suffered a jolting setback in Iowa, predicted he'dbounce back in New Hampshire.   ``I sense a rising tide,'' the vice president said.   Bush took some comfort from New Hampshire's tradition ofrejecting Iowa winners _ including Bush in 1980, and Walter F.Mondale in 1984.   All the candidates _ seven Democrats and five Republicans _sounded upbeat about their prospects. Optimism was bipartisan.   ``I hope we are going to do a good deal better than people areexpecting,'' said Democratic Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, whowas dead last in Iowa after pulling his campaign out of the statelast year.   Pat Robertson, who finished ahead of Bush in Iowa, was in atight battle for third place in the GOP primary with Rep. Jack Kempand former Gov. Pete du Pont of Delaware.   ``I don't know where all those political pundits are today butthey ran for cover four years ago and they're likely to run forcover tomorrow,'' said du Pont.   Kemp insisted he, too, would fool the pollsters. ``I'm going tofinish in a good competitive third or higher,'' he said.   Robertson hinted he might equal his Iowa showing and come insecond. The former television evangelist's finish in Iowa was farstronger than the polls had indicated, so no one was willing topredict how large his New Hampshire following might be.   Robertson was trying to distance himself from statements made ina debate Sunday night, when he said there were Soviet nuclearmissiles in Cuba. That drew a quick denial from the White House andcriticism from the rest of the GOP field.   He initially stuck by the statement on Monday, but underquestioning, acknowledged he had no first-hand evidence that therewere nuclear missiles on the island.   Democratic Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois said he was sure he'ddefeat Gephardt, the Missouri congressman, for second place. Andreferring to Dukakis' commanding lead in the polls, he said, ``Ithink there is a possibility of a real surprise coming tomorrow.''   As it has since 1960, the mountain hamlet of Dixville Notch wasthe first to report results. On the Republican side, Bush received11 votes, Dole had six, Kemp five, du Pont two, Alexander Haig two,and Pat Robertson one.   The town's seven Democratic voters gave Gephardt four votes andSimon three.   ``I don't think it makes any difference if you're the first voteor the last. It's the vote that counts _ the privilege,'' said NeilTillotson, 89, town moderator and the community's patriarch, whotraditionally casts the first ballot just after midnight.   Gephardt was the Democratic winner in Iowa, and Simon finishedsecond and Dukakis third in the caucuses there. But statewideresults in New Hampshire were likely to be different.   Dukakis was the overwhelming favorite with Simon and Gephardtbattling for second.   Opinion polls consistently gave Dukakis the support of between36 and 40 percent of Democrats.   Polls of New Hampshire Republicans showed a dramatic impact ofthe Iowa results. Bush, once the choice of 52 percent of thestate's Republicans, entered primary day in a virtual dead heatwith Dole.   Six candidates appeared at the Mall of New Hampshire inManchester on Monday for a ``Rally Finale'' and a chance to pick upsupport among the thousands of holiday shoppers.   From a platform set up between a shoe store and a jewelery shop,Republicans Kemp and du Pont and Democrats Gore, Simon, former Gov.Bruce Babbitt of Arizona and Jesse Jackson delivered abbreviatedversions of their stock stump speeches.   Leadership was a campaign theme sounded in both Iowa and NewHampshire, particularly in the struggle between Bush and Dole. Butthe foreign policy debate on the Republican side featured morehawkish rhetoric in New Hampshire than in dovish Iowa.   Dole, who rarely mentioned Star Wars in Iowa, made a strong pleain New Hampshire for development and deployment of the missiledefense system.   Candidates in both parties also emphasized their fealty to lowtaxes, an article of political faith in New Hampshire.   Bush, who brought in a corps of congressmen to campaign for himon the weekend, trumpeted the endorsement of former Sen. BarryGoldwater of Arizona in a television commercial Monday.   Goldwater, the 1964 GOP presidential nominee and a hero toconservatives, called Bush the ``best qualified candidate of mylifetime _ other than me ...''</TEXT></DOC>
