Looking for unspoiled scenery,cheap extras and good local technicians for filming on location?   It's still a word-of-mouth proposition, but some of the world'sleading filmmakers are discovering Venezuela's steamy jungles, vastsavannahs and palm-studded beaches for shooting their exoticlocation shots.   The South American country is being promoted as a cheaper andmore accessible alternative to Brazil and a non-politicizedsubstitute for South Africa.   British producer Derek Granger brought Sir Alec Guinness andJames Wilby, star of ``A Room With a View,'' to the jungles nearCanaima, 400 miles southeast of Caracas, in late January to film aportion of ``A Handful of Dust,'' based on the novel by EvelynWaugh.   The French director Alain Siritzky came last November to checkout scenery in Canaima and Caracas for the sixth movie in the``Emmanuelle'' series, now being shot for him by a local film group.   Last October, two episodes of the TV series ``Dynasty'' werefilmed here. They involve a jungle rescue.   And Venezuela recently beat out Jamaica to provide various beachsites for a series of Pepsi-Cola commercials.   ``For directors who are interested in the kinds of scenes shotin Brazil or Mexico or Argentina, we are unbeatable: We're thecheapest, the freshest and we have good technicians,'' said GeorgeKorda, a Hungarian-born Venezuelan whose company, Korda Films, isundertaking the ``Emmanuelle'' project.   Filmmakers attribute the growing interest in Venezuela in partto the never-ending quest by directors for something unique anduntouched _ something that, ideally, no other director has usedbefore.   ``Everybody knows about Brazil and Mexico, and they're a bittired of that so they're discovering Venezuela,'' said Korda.   But Venezuela's attitude toward foreign filmmakers has alsochanged, they say, along with the value of its currency. Successivedevaluations of the bolivar since 1983 have made it possible fordirectors to put up actors and crewmen in three or four star hotelsfor $20 a night. Extras can be hired for $13 a day _ a marvelouswage in a nation where the urban minimum wage is $65 a month.   Foreign directors say they have found local production companiesfully competent for back-up work. Many Venezuelans in film weretrained abroad under government scholarships.   And Venezuela's jungles are also more accessible, because theyare smaller than Brazil's vast Amazon basin and closer topopulation centers.   ``Our location manager said it would be easier (to film here)than work in the heart of Brazil,'' Granger said in an interview.``We had only 10 days to film. We needed good immediate facilities,good hotels and easy means of transport.''   And the government, which has been interested in promotingtourism ever since oil prices fell, is content to see the moviepeople come, local promoters say.   However, some have found the government difficult to work with.The arts crew of ``A Handful of Dust'' could not get the VenezuelanGuayana Corp., which controls the national park in which Canaima islocated, to provide the animals. So they instead had to rentparrots, monkeys and deer from a local landowner.   But there's another message that Venezuelan promoters arebeginning to whisper: ``Stable government, no racial problems.''   Except for the animals, some Venezuelan landscapes are deadringers for the South African savannah.   This new selling point could take on more weight as morestudios, including the 120 Americans banded together in theindustry pressure group Filmmakers United Against Apartheid, seekto avoid possible commercial backlashes from filming in SouthAfrica.   ``There are places here that look just like South Africa, onlywe're much closer and we don't have racial problems or a civilwar,'' said Rolando Haiek, whose company, 5247 Producciones, washired by Granger to provide everything needed locally for ``AHandful of Dust.''   5247 Productions now hopes to get a Canadian production companyto film ``Miss Helen,'' a story set in South Africa, in Venezuelainstead.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv</NOTE></DOC>
